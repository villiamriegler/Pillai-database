2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple  sclerosis  is  a  chronic,  progressive,  autoimmune,  debilitating  neurodegenerative  disorder 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 8/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
with multifocal demyelination affecting the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord. This process leads to 
neurological impairment and severe disability. It is one of the most common neurological diseases in 
young  adults  and  the  leading  cause  of  non-traumatic  disability  in  young  and  middle-aged  adults. 
Typically, it begins in the second or third decade of life. In 2008, the global incidence was estimated 
at  2.5  individuals  per  100 000  and  the  global  prevalence  was  estimated  at  30  individuals  per 
100 000,  with  women  having  a  two-fold  higher  likelihood  of  developing  MS  than  men.  Regionally, 
the  estimated  median  prevalence  of  MS  is  greatest  in  Europe  (80  per  100 000),  followed  by  the 
Eastern Mediterranean (14.9 per 100 000), the Americas (8.3 per 100 000), the Western Pacific (5 
per 100 000), Southeast Asia (2.8 per 100 000) and Africa (0.3 per 100 000). 
Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated disease involving both cellular and humoral components of 
the  immune  system.  The  generally  accepted  view  of  the  immunopathogenesis  of  MS  in  humans 
implicates  non-anergic  myelin-specific  auto-reactive  T-cells  activated  in  the  peripheral  immune 
system  via interplay  between  environmental  triggers  and  genetic  susceptibility. After  activation,  T-
cells  acquire  the  potential  to  cross  the  blood-brain  barrier  resulting  in  central  nervous  system 
lesions, which can be assessed by various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. 
Clinically,  MS  presents  with  neurologic  deficits  with  differing  localisations  presenting  at  different 
times.  Diagnosis  is  made  by  clinical  features  and  supportive  MRI  with  the  evaluation  of  volumetric 
abnormalities.  Clinical  onset  most  frequently  accompanies  an  acute  or  sub-acute  episode  of 
neurological  disturbance,  known  as  a  clinically  isolated  syndrome  (CIS).  Patients  with  defined  MS 
can  be  classified  into  four  essential  groups  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  disease  course: 
relapsing-remitting  (RRMS),  secondary  progressive  (SPMS),  progressive-relapsing  (PRMS)  or 
primary progressive (PPMS). Relapses may occur in RRMS, PRMS or SPMS, and the term “relapsing 
MS” is used to encompass all forms involving relapses. Relapsing forms of MS are the most frequent 
clinical presentation of the disease. 
Teriflunomide  is  the  predominant  active  metabolite  of  leflunomide  (Arava),  which  has  been 
marketed  as  a  disease-modifying  therapy  for  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  the  United  States  since 
September 1998, in Europe since 1999, and for the treatment of active RA in adults in Canada since 
April 2000.   
Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-inflammatory properties that selectively and 
reversibly inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DH), required for 
the  de  novo  pyrimidine  synthesis.  As  a  consequence  teriflunomide  reduces  the  proliferation  of 
dividing cells that need de novo synthesis of pyrimidine to expand. The exact mechanism by which 
teriflunomide  exerts  its  therapeutic  effect  in  MS  is  not  fully  understood,  but  this  is  mediated  by  a 
reduced number of lymphocytes.  
2.2.  Quality aspects

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The 
chemical 
name 
of 
teriflunomide 
is 
(Z)-2-Cyano-3-hydroxy-but-2-enoic 
acid-(4-
trifluoromethylphenyl) amide with molecular formula C 12H9F3N2O2 and relative molecular mass 270.2 
g/mol.  Its structural formula is shown below: 
Teriflunomide  appears  as  a  white  to  almost  white,  odourless,  non-hygroscopic  powder.  It  is  a 
biopharmaceutical  classification  system  (BCS)  Class  2  compound,  which  is  practically  insoluble  in 
water;  sparingly  soluble  in  acetone;  and  slightly  soluble  in  ethanol,  acetonitrile  and  methylene 
chloride.  
Teriflunomide contains no asymmetric centres, therefore no enantiomers are possible.  
The  presence  of  polymorphs  of  teriflunomide  has  been  evaluated  using  DSC  and  X-ray  powder 
diffraction  and  recrystallization  from  different  solvents  and  only  one  polymorphic  form  has  been 
observed.  In  addition,  single  crystal  X-ray  diffraction  analysis  studies  have  demonstrated  that 
teriflunomide in the solid state (crystalline phase) is only the Z-isomer. 
The  structure  of  teriflunomide  has  been  elucidated  by  elemental  analysis  (C,  H  and  N),  spectroscopic 
analyses  (IR,  UV,  1H-NMR,  13C-NMR,15N-NMR,  19F-NMR  and  mass  spectrometry)  and  single  X-ray 
diffraction analysis. All data are consistent with the proposed structure. 
Manufacture 
At  the  time  of  CHMP  opinion  the  active  substance  teriflunomide  used  for  Aubagio  is  manufactured  at 
two manufacturing sites in accordance with the current Good Manufacturing Practices. QP declarations 
issued by the Qualified Person have been provided.  
Teriflunomide is synthesized in three main steps starting from 4-(Trifluoromethyl) aniline, cyanoacetic 
acid and acetic anhydride. Teriflunomide is then crystallized and jet-milled.   
Detailed  information  on  the  manufacturing  process,  control  of  critical  reaction  temperatures  and 
reaction times has been provided by the applicant. The specifications and control methods for starting 
materials,  reagents  and  intermediate  products  have  been  presented.  Potential impurities arising  from 
the  starting  materials,  reagents,  the  route  of  synthesis  or  potential  degradation  products  have  been 
adequately discussed. 
The  packaging  of  teriflunomide  drug  substance  consists  of  double  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE) 
bags placed inside fibre drums or cardboard boxes. The LDPE bags used as primary packaging are of 
food grade quality and comply with Ph. Eur. and European Directive 2002/72/EC.

Specification 
As no Eur. Ph. monograph exists for teriflunomide, in-house specifications have been set for the active 
substance, in accordance with the principles of the relevant ICH guidelines.  
The  active  substance  specification  includes  appropriate  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  identification 
(HPLC,  IR),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.  Eur.),  heavy  metals  (Ph.  Eur.), 
residual solvents (GC), water content (KF) and microbial contamination (Ph. Eur).   
The  control  tests  and  specifications  of  the  drug  substance  have  been  adequately  justified.  The 
influence  of  the  particle  size  distribution  on  bioavailability  and  content  uniformity  has  been  studied. 
Data have been provided to demonstrate that jet-milling used as final manufacturing step of the drug 
substance  ensures  adequate  and  reproducible  particles  sizes  and  therefore,  it  is  acceptable  to  omit 
particle size distribution from the drug substance specification. 
The analytical methods used to test the drug substance have been properly described and validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Batch  analysis  data  have  been  provided  on  six  pilot  scale  batches  and  fourteen  production  scale 
batches. All results are within the proposed specification limits and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  three  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance 
stored in LDPE bags representative of the primary packaging intended for commercial use. 
The parameters tested during stabilities studies were appearance, identification (XRPD), assay, related 
substances, water content, microbial contamination, particle size and relative humidity (water activity). 
Long term studies for up to 24 months at 25°C±2°C/60%±5% RH, and accelerated studies for up to 6 
months at 40°C±2°C/75%±5% RH have shown no significant degradation and all the results remained 
within the specification. 
In  addition,  forced  degradation  studies  on  teriflunomide  drug  substance  in  solid  state  and  in  solution 
have  been  performed  by  treatment  with  heat,  humidity,  oxidizing,  acidic  or  alkaline  conditions.  The 
data  obtained  in  stress  studies  show  that  teriflunomide  in  solid  state  is  very  stable,  while  in  solution 
under neutral, acid or oxidative conditions degradation is observed. 
A  photostability  study  following  ICH  Q1B  guideline  has  been  performed  on  three  production  scale 
batches showing that teriflunomide is not sensitive to light. 
The stability results provided indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier 
is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed re-test period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The  proposed  drug  product  is  a  pale  blue  to  pastel  blue,  pentagonal  immediate  release  film-coated 
tablet containing 14 mg of active substance.

Pharmaceutical Development 
Since  teriflunomide  is  intended  for  long-term  treatment  of  multiple  sclerosis  in  adult  patient 
population, which is a chronic disease, the aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop easy 
to  swallow  immediate-release  film-coated  tablet  formulation  containing  teriflunomide  as  active 
substance.  
The development of the formulation has been adequately described. Initial investigations were focused 
on the selection of the appropriate dosage strength.  
The  development  studies  of  the  tablet  focused  on  physicochemical  properties  of  the  drug  substance, 
which  were  identified  as  potentially  having  a  higher  impact  on  drug  product  performance.    These 
properties were particle size, water content, stability and purity. 
Particle size was initially identified as potentially impacting dissolution and thus bioavailability because 
teriflunomide  is  a  BCS  Class  2  active  substance  (high  permeability,  low  solubility).  To  investigate 
whether  particle  size  had  an  impact  on  bioavailability,  a  bioequivalence  study  with  formulations 
manufactured with milled versus unmilled, sieved  drug was performed. This study  demonstrated that 
the  particle  size  of  the  drug  substance  (within  the  range  studied)  does  not  have  an  impact  on 
bioavailability. In addition, it was demonstrated that particle size has no impact on content uniformity. 
Nonetheless,  as  described  in  section  2.2.2.,  teriflunomide  particle  size  is  controlled  on  the  last  jet-
milling step of the manufacturing process of the active substance. 
The non-hygroscopic nature of teriflunomide and the use of the aluminium blister ensured that the risk 
of hydrolytic formation of degradation products and the risk of microbial growth would be minimal. 
With  regards  to  stability  and  purity,  batch  analysis  results  have  been  submitted  demonstrating  that 
these parameters remain within the approved specification during the re-test period. 
The  choice  of  excipients  has  been  justified  based  on  results  obtained  from  drug  substance/excipient 
compatibility  studies.  No  incompatibility  issues  were  identified  between  teriflunomide  and  the 
excipients selected.  
Most  of  the  formulations  used  in  clinical  studies  have  essentially  the  same  composition  and  were 
manufactured with similar manufacturing process as of the 14 mg commercial product.   
However, during formulation development one major change was performed. Colloidal anhydrous silica 
was removed from the tablet core formulation, as it was shown that it had an effect on the stability of 
teriflunomide within the drug product, promoting the formation of one of the degradation products.  In 
addition,  the  film-coating  thickness  was  slightly increased.  Since  colloidal  anhydrous  silica  may  affect 
the  dissolution,  and  thus  absorption  and  efficacy,  a  bioequivalence  study  was  conducted.  This  study 
demonstrated  the  bioequivalence  of  the  formulations,  and  therefore  the  new  formulation  was 
introduced into the on-going phase II clinical program. 
Other  clinical  batches  differed  in  colorant  composition  and  had  different  shape  and  embossment. 
Although, these were small differences not likely to affect dissolution, comparative dissolution studies 
supported their equivalence to the commercial formulation.

Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  for  teriflunomide  commercial  film-coated  tablets  is  a  standard  wet 
granulation  process  involving  conventional  mixing,  fluid–bed  granulation,  drying,  sieving,  mixing  and 
lubrication,  tableting  and  film-coating.  A  detailed  manufacturing  description  and  flow  scheme  have 
been provided.  
All  critical  process  parameters  have  been  identified  and  are  controlled  by  appropriate  in-process 
controls. 
The film-coated tablets are packaged into thermoformed aluminium/aluminium blister packs, which are 
then  introduced  into  wallet  kits  and  packaged  into  carton  boxes.  Confirmation  is  provided  that  the 
primary  packaging  components  of  the  packaging  materials  in  contact  with  the  drug  product  comply 
with Directive 2002/72/EEC (and amendments) and Ph. Eur. monograph 3.1.11.  
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  during  development  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the 
major steps of the manufacturing process and has been demonstrated to be capable and to be able to 
reproducibly  produce  finished  product  of  the  intended  quality.  Process  validation  on  the  first  three 
production scale batches will be performed post opinion. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  appearance  (visual), 
identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.), 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (HPLC),  water  content  (KF)  and  microbial  contamination  (Ph.  Eur.).  The 
proposed specifications include all required tests relevant for this dosage form. 
All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. Appropriate data 
have  been  presented  to  justify  the  release  specifications  for  each  quality  characteristic  that  is 
controlled. 
The  batch  analysis  data  on  three  pilot  scale  batches  manufactured  during  development  and  three 
production  scale  batches  of  the  commercial  formulation  show  that  the  tablets  can  be  manufactured 
reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this 
oral preparation. 
The  analytical  methods  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  in  accordance  with  ICH 
guidelines, and have shown to be stability-indicating.

Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  under  long  term  (30°C±2°C/65%±5%  RH)  and  accelerated 
(40°C±2°C/60%±5% RH) storage conditions according to ICH requirements, on three production scale 
batches stored  in the primary packaging as proposed for marketing. Up to 24 months long-term and 
up to 6 months accelerated stability data have been provided.  
Samples were tested for appearance (visual), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution 
(Ph.Eur.), water content (KF), microbial purity (Ph. Eur.) and relative humidity (water activity). 
No  significant  tendencies  in  any  of  the  parameters  tested  have  been  observed.  All  stability  results 
presented remained within the proposed specifications during 24 months of storage.  
In addition, a photostability study has been performed on one production scale batch as defined in the 
ICH Q1B guideline. No changes regarding appearance, assay, individual impurities and total impurities 
have been observed, indicating that the film-coated tablets are not sensitive to light. 
The stability results presented are satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the commercially 
packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Teriflunomide  is  a  selective,  non-competitive  and  reversible  inhibitor  of  mitochondrial  dihydroorotate 
dehydrogenase (DHO-DH), which blocks the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines. As a consequence, the 
activation and proliferation of rapidly dividing T and B lymphocytes is arrested, which is hypothesised 
to interfere with MS manifestation.    
Teriflunomide  is  the  active  main  metabolite  of  leflunomide.  The  non-clinical  development  of 
teriflunomide  was  originally  guided  by  experience  gained  with  the  parent  compound  leflunomide  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 14/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
terms  of  study  designs  and  anticipated  target  organ  toxicities.  Nevertheless,  an  independent  self-
standing development of teriflunomide was later pursued non-clinically, because of the intended use of 
teriflunomide as treatment in multiple sclerosis as opposed to the different indication of leflunomide. 
Pivotal toxicology studies were performed in compliance with GLP. Apart from the in vivo evaluation of 
cardiovascular  function  in  dogs,  all  safety  pharmacology  studies  of  the  core  battery  also  adhered  to 
GLP  regulations.  Other  safety  pharmacological  investigations  were  conducted  prior  to  implementation 
of ICH guidelines in accordance with internal procedures of the applicant and did not follow current GLP 
standards,  but  were  adequately  reported  to  support  the  safety  pharmacological  profile  of  the  active 
substance. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Anti-proliferative  effects  of  teriflunomide  on  lymphocytes  were  analysed  in vitro  using  mouse  splenic 
lymphocytes,  rat  splenocytes  and  human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMC).  Inhibition  of 
proliferation  by  teriflunomide  (1-100 µM)  depended  on  species,  selected  cell  type/cell  line,  mitogenic 
stimulus and other experimental conditions. In assays conducted during leflunomide and teriflunomide 
development,  animal  cells  appeared  to  be  more  sensitive  to  teriflunomide  activity  than  human  cells. 
The  strongest  interference  with  lymphocyte  proliferation  was  determined  in  rat  splenocytes  (145-fold 
higher  than  human  PBMCs).  A  4-  and  8-fold  higher  potency  was  found  in  mouse  splenocytes  and  in 
whole blood samples of dogs, respectively. No significant influences on cellular viability were noted. 
Teriflunomide  was  reported  earlier  to  inhibit  DNA  and  RNA  synthesis  and  the  expression  of  nuclear 
antigens. Reversal of this effect by addition of uridine or cytidine to the lymphocyte cultures indicated 
that  teriflunomide  interferes  with  de novo  pyrimidine  synthesis.  The  high  affinity  interaction  of 
teriflunomide with DHO-DH including its species-specificity was also previously demonstrated. 
Teriflunomide  (0.004  -  10 nM)  did  not  reveal  more  than  50 %  inhibition  when  investigated  against  a 
battery  of  over  100 receptors  and  ion  channels  in vitro,  which  were  either  prepared  from  relevant 
tissues  or  expressed  in  recombinant  cells.  Inhibitory  effects  were  only  noted  on  cyclooxygenase-1 
(-37 %)  and  purine  receptors  (-44 %).  Moreover,  teriflunomide  weakly  displaced  ligand  binding  to 
serotonergic  5-HT 1D-receptors  (-22 %),  progesterone  receptors  and  thyroid  hormone  receptors 
(-21 %) and slightly inhibited nitric oxide synthase (-24 %). 
The  primary  pharmacodynamic  activities  of  teriflunomide  were  investigated  in  vivo  in  rodent  models 
(mouse  and  rats)  of  experimental  autoimmune  encephalitis  (EAE).  In  these  studies,  effects  of 
teriflunomide  on  neurological  deficits,  neuronal  function,  spinal  cord  pathologies  and  lymphocyte 
populations  were  assessed  testing  different  prophylactic  and  therapeutic  treatment  regimens;  a 
delayed onset and diminished severity of the disease were observed.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not performed in animals.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety  pharmacological  evaluations  of  the  CNS  function  revealed  no  influence  of  teriflunomide  on 
general  behaviour,  body  temperature  and  pro-  or  anticonvulsant  liability.  In  rats,  a  significantly 
reduced  locomotor  activity  was  noted  at  oral  doses  ≥ 10 mg/kg;  this  observation  was  not  made  in  a 
comparable  study  in  mice.  Of  note,  impaired  motility  was  also  evident  in  single  dose  toxicity  studies 
testing  p.o.  and  i.p.  administrations  in  mice  and  rats.  In  repeated  dose  toxicity  with  i.v.  dosing  over 
1 month  in  rats  and  3 months  oral  administration  in  dogs,  stilted  gait  and  ataxia  were  observed  in 
some animals, respectively.  
In  safety  pharmacology  studies  of  cardiovascular  function,  a  slight  inhibition  of  hERG  currents  at 
≤ 100 µM teriflunomide was seen, which coincided with the shortening of the action potential duration 
in rabbit Purkinje fibres at 100 µM. Conversely, administration of 300 µM teriflunomide was observed 
to lead to weak facilitation of hERG-mediated repolarisation in vitro. No influence on cardiac conduction 
was  apparent  in  safety  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  in  dogs  or  during  thorough  clinical 
evaluation of the teriflunomide effects on the QT interval.  
Teriflunomide did not affect respiratory function in guinea pigs at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg p.o.  
In  a  supplementary  study  in  rats,  dose-dependently  increased  diuresis  and  excretion  of  electrolytes 
were observed at oral teriflunomide doses of ≥ 3 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions of teriflunomide were not studied in the non-clinical setting.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  after  single  p.o.  or  i.v.  administration  of  teriflunomide  were 
evaluated  in  male  mice,  rats,  rabbits  and  dogs  using  formulations  that  were  subsequently  also 
analysed  in  toxicological  investigations.  These  results  were  complemented  with  toxicokinetic  data, 
which  document  teriflunomide  pharmacokinetics  following  repeated  dosing.  Protein  binding  properties 
of teriflunomide were investigated in vitro. 
Teriflunomide was maximally absorbed in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs within 1 h, 6 h, 4-8 h or 1-4 h 
post  dose  culminating  in  levels  of  36 µg/ml,  48.4 µg/ml,  25.9 µg/ml  or  58.9 µg/ml,  respectively. 
Teriflunomide  showed  almost  100%  oral  bioavailability  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs,  whereas  it  showed 
clearly lower levels (~66 %) in rabbits. Extensive protein binding between 96 and more than 99 % was 
determined in animals and man. 
Following  repeated  oral  administration  of  teriflunomide  to  mice  and  rats  for  up  to  3  and  6 months, 
respectively,  systemic  exposure  generally  increased  linearly  with  dose.  The  exposure  increased  in  a 
greater than dose-proportional manner in dogs after repeated oral administration for up to 12 months 
and in pregnant rabbits treated orally for up to 7 days. Accumulation of teriflunomide was noted in all 
species after repeated doses reaching steady-state after approximately 1 month in mice and dogs and 
after 3 months in rats. There were no gender differences across test species.  
Teriflunomide demonstrated rapid distribution after single dosing in rats. Highest concentrations were 
identified  in  skin,  gastrointestinal  tract,  liver  and  kidney,  while  the  lowest  levels  were  determined  in 
brain, spinal cord and eyes. The brain or spinal cord to blood ratio was ≤ 2 % and ≤ 5 %, respectively, 
following experimental induction of EAE indicating limited penetration of the active substance into the 
Assessment report

CNS. There was no particular enrichment of teriflunomide in any region of the brain and no differences 
between pigmented and non-pigmented rat strains were observed. 
The  calculated  volume  of  distribution  (V ss = 0.11 l/kg)  was  based  on  an  assumption  that  drug 
elimination occurs solely from the central compartment. This could not be confirmed for teriflunomide, 
leading to an underestimation of the true V ss.  
Metabolism  of  teriflunomide  involves  oxidation,  hydrolysis,  and  glucuronide  and  sulphate  conjugation 
reactions.  4-trifluoro-methylaniline  (4-TFMA)  oxanilic  acid  was  the  main  metabolite  in  all  species 
representing  about  7 %,  43 %,  5 %,  38 %  and  18 %  of  the  oral  dose  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and 
human, respectively. Apart from this metabolite, significant levels of the sulphate-conjugate of mono-
hydroxylated  teriflunomide  were  determined  in  rabbits  and  dogs.  Moreover,  mono-hydroxylated 
derivatives  of  teriflunomide  and  4-TFMA  sulphate  were  additionally  found  in  dogs,  whereas  4-TFMA 
2-hydroxy malonamic acid was measured in rats.  Among minor metabolites, a significant level of the 
metabolite  A813226  was  determined  in  rats.  4-TFMA  concentrations  of  ~3 ng/ml  were  detected  after 
oral administration in mice, rats and dogs and at a concentration of ≤ 0.626 ng/ml in rabbits. Of note, 
all human metabolites were identified in at least one animal species. 
Independent of the administration route, teriflunomide was found to be almost completely excreted in 
all  species,  within  14 days  in  mice,  rats  and  rabbits  and  within  28 days  in  dogs.  This  indicated  drug 
accumulation,  which  was  also  noted  after  multiple administrations  in  these  animal  species.  Increased 
drug persistence was further corroborated by a low plasma clearance in all species and a terminal half-
life  of  18-37 h  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs.  The  terminal  half-life  was  substantially  shorter  in rabbits  (~4-
5 h). Following oral administration in mass-balance studies, the major radioactivity was predominantly 
eliminated  by  faeces  in  mice  (> 70 %)  and  by  urine  in  rabbits  (> 62 %),  rats  and  dogs  (51 %, 
respectively).  Unchanged  teriflunomide  accounted  for  the  main  part  of  radioactivity  in  faeces  of  mice 
(> 65 %, p.o.), rats (22 %, p.o.) and dogs (26 %, p.o.) as well as in urine of rabbits (~20 %, p.o.). 
A significant amount of teriflunomide was found to be excreted into milk (> 23%) in lactating rats.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In single dose toxicity studies in mice and rats, similar clinical signs and mortality rates were observed 
after  administering  teriflunomide  orally  (p.o.)  or  via  the  intraperitoneal  route  (i.p.).  In  both  species, 
teriflunomide doses of ≥ 200 mg/kg p.o. and ≥ 100 mg/kg i.p. were lethal. Clinical effects comprised 
impaired  motility  and  various  behavioural  abnormalities,  which  were  also  observed  in  CNS  safety 
pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity studies. Effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa were seen in 
rats  at  doses  ≥ 200 mg/kg  p.o.  Signs  of  liver  toxicity,  presented  as  swollen  liver  lobes  or  liver 
deposits, were observed at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg i.p. In addition, faecal discolouration was seen in mice 
and diarrhoea in both species.

In  addition,  3 month  repeated  dose  oral  toxicity  studies  and  multiple  intravenous  injections  for  one 
month  were  analysed  in  rats  and  dogs.  Systemic  teriflunomide  exposure  in  these  investigations 
increased  dose-dependently  without  significant  differences  between  genders.  Accumulation  of 
teriflunomide  was  noted  in  all  species.  Overall,  lower  exposure  levels  were  achieved  in  toxicity 
investigations  and  no  safety  margins  could  be  established  with  regard  to  human  therapeutic 
concentrations indicating a generally higher sensitivity of animals compared to humans. 
The teriflunomide metabolites 4-TFMA and A813226 were toxicologically qualified in single and multiple 
dose  toxicology  studies  in  mice  and  rats  and  in  genotoxicity  studies  in vitro  and  in vivo.  Similar  to 
toxicity results obtained with teriflunomide, signs of increased turnover of red blood cells and oxidative 
damage (decreased levels of erythrocytes, haematocrit and haemoglobin with concomitantly increased 
reticulocyte counts and methaemoglobin values as well as Heinz and Howell-Jolly body formation) were 
apparent in these investigations. Furthermore, hemosiderosis and extramedullar haematopoiesis were 
detected  as  secondary  effects.  Accordingly,  macroscopic  findings  in  premature  descendents  that  had 
received high doses of 4-TFMA or A813226 in single dose toxicity studies comprised discoloured lungs 
and livers indicative of haemorrhages. 
Genotoxicity 
Teriflunomide  was  tested  negative  for  gene  mutations  in  the  Ames  test  and  in  mammalian  cells 
in vitro. It was also negative in three in vivo tests: in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in mice, in 
vivo  chromosome  aberration  test  in  Chinese  hamsters  and  14-day  repeated  dose  bone  marrow 
chromosome  aberration  test  in  rats.  Positive  results  were  obtained  only  in  the  in vitro  chromosome 
aberration test in human lymphocytes.  
The  metabolite  4-TFMA  was  positive  in  one  bacterial  strain  in  the  Ames  test  with  sensitivity  for  base 
substitutions, in the HPRT assay in V79 cells and also in a chromosomal aberration assay in V79 cells. 
Although  4-TFMA  demonstrated  a  mutagenic  and  clastogenic  potential  in vitro,  it  did  not  cause 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 19/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
clastogenicity in vivo up to lethal doses or induce DNA synthesis in vivo in rat liver up to MTD with oral 
administration. The metabolite A813226 was intensively tested for its mutagenic potential in a variety 
of in vitro and in vivo assays with additional in vitro mechanistic investigations for its capacity to inhibit 
DHO-DH  and  was  devoid  of  any  biologically  relevant  genotoxic  potential.  The  impurity  A782068  was 
tested in the Ames test with negative results for mutagenic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity  potential  of  teriflunomide  was  tested  in  2-year  studies  in  mice  and  rats  after  oral 
administration of doses up to 12 mg/kg/d in mice and 4 mg/kg/day in rats. Survival in high dose mice 
was  slightly  reduced  and  dosing  of  males  was  ceased  in  that  group  at  week 95  as  survival  fell  below 
20/sex. The main reasons were ulcer and inflammation of skin and gastrointestinal tract. Effects such 
as atrophy of thymus were observed in mid and high dose males. Survival was also reduced in rats and 
treatment of the high dose male group was ceased at week 92 because of mortality. The major non-
neoplastic  effects  observed  in  rat  were  bone  marrow  hypocellularity  and  decrease  in  splenic 
lymphocytes.  There  were  some  slight  but  not  significant  increases  in  adenomas  in  treated  rats 
compared  to  controls.  Pituitary  gland  adenomas  in  male  rats  were  slightly  increased,  but  numbers 
were  still  within  historical  control  ranges  and  statistical  significance  was  not  consistent  among  all 
control groups. This was also the case for C-cell adenoma in thyroid gland in females.  
No treatment related neoplastic effects were observed in either of the species. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  of  teriflunomide  was  evaluated  in  fertility  and  embryo-
foetal  development  study  in  rats,  embryo-foetal  development  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits  and  a  pre- 
and post-natal development study in rats. Furthermore, the toxicity of teriflunomide was investigated 
in an exploratory study in juvenile rats. 
Teriflunomide  did  not  adversely  affect  male  and  female  fertility  (mating  performance,  fertility  and 
gestation  parameters),  although  sperm  counts  were  reduced.  In  the  female  fertility  study,  effects  on 
early  embryonic  and  foetal  development  were  seen  (total  post  implantation  loss,  increase  in  early 
resorption,  decrease  in  number  of  foetuses  per  litter,  decrease  in  foetal  weights  and  increase  of 
external  malformations).  The  NOAELs  for  male  and  female  fertility  were  established  at  10  and 
8.6 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
In  the  embryo-foetal  development  studies  in  the  rat  and  rabbit,  embryotoxicity  and  teratogenicity  of 
teriflunomide was observed. In pregnant rats and rabbits treated with teriflunomide during the period 
of  organogenesis  embryo-lethality  and  malformations  occurred  at  doses  >1 mg/kg/day.  Maternal 
NOAELs  were  established  at  1  mg/kg/day  in  the  rat  and  rabbit.  Findings  of  maternal  toxicity  in  both 
species included decrease in maternal weight and food consumption. 
In  the  exploratory  prenatal  and  postnatal  development  study,  exposure  to  teriflunomide  from 
implantation to weaning did induce maternal toxicity (body weight loss) at 0.6 mg/kg/day. Compound-
related  clinical  effects  were  observed  in  the  F1 generation  pups  in  the  0.6 mg/kg  and  1 mg/kg  group 
(malrotated  digits,  decreased  ossification).  In  the  pivotal  study,  no  maternal  toxicity  occurred  at  the 
highest dose, i.e. 0.3 mg/kg/day. However, in the F1 offspring, teriflunomide induced malformations at 
0.3 mg/kg/day, but did not affect survival, behaviour and reproductive performance. A no-teratogenic 
risk level for teriflunomide in humans was established at 0.25 μg/ml. This value was derived from the 
NOAEL  exposure  in  the  embryo-foetal  toxicity  study  in  rabbits  (60 μg∙h/ml)  plus  a  10-fold  safety

margin. Thus, the AUC 0-24 considered as posing a no-teratogenic risk for humans is 6 μg∙h/ml, which 
corresponds to a trough concentration of 0.25 μg/ml (i.e. 6 μg∙h/ml/24 h).  
No specific toxicities of teriflunomide were observed in an exploratory study in juvenile rats. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Systemic  exposure  after  oral  teriflunomide  administration  for  up  to  12 months  increased  dose-
dependently  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs.  In  pregnant  rabbits,  exposure  increased  in  a  greater  than  dose-
proportional  manner  while  in  pregnant  rats,  less  than  dose-proportionally  increased  exposure  was 
determined. No gender differences were evident, but accumulation of teriflunomide was observed in all 
species  upon  repetitive  dosing.  Compared  to  teriflunomide,  exposure  to  the  4-TFMA  metabolite  was 
considerably lower and amounted to less than 0.01 to 0.07 %  of the AUC 0-24 h  of teriflunomide in the 
different animal species. 
Local Tolerance  
Teriflunomide  did  not  show  any  irritation  or  sensitisation  potential  when  administered  by  i.v.,  i.a.  or 
p.v.  injections  or  after  dermal  or  ocular  applications  in  rabbits.  The  sensitisation  properties  of 
teriflunomide were studied in guinea pig and no evidence of sensitisation was observed. The phototoxic 
potential  of  teriflunomide  was  assessed  in  mouse  3T3  fibroblast  cells  in vitro.  No  phototoxicity  was 
evident up to the maximally soluble concentration of 200 µg/ml. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  applicant  submitted  an  environmental  risk  assessment  of  teriflunomide.  With  respect  to  the 
assessment  of  persistence,  bioaccumulation  potential  and  toxicity,  results  of  two  studies  on  the  n-
octanol/water  partition  coefficient  were  provided.  Phase  I  and  parts  of  phase  II  assessment  were 
included in the ERA.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  anti-proliferative  potency  of  teriflunomide  including  its  efficacy  in  well-established  animal  models 
of multiple sclerosis using both prophylactic and therapeutic administrations was reliably documented 
in the dossier. While the fact that teriflunomide was only developed in the multiple sclerosis indication 
did not justify not performing secondary pharmacology studies, the CHMP considered that the data of 
Arava  indicate  that  leflunomide  and  thus  presumably  also  its  active  metabolite  teriflunomide,  do  not 
have  any  activity  other  than  the  primary  mechanism  of  action  as  an  immunomodulatory  agent. 
Therefore, further secondary pharmacodynamics studies were not required. 
No clinically relevant effects on CNS, cardiovascular or respiratory function were observed in the safety 
pharmacological investigations. The CHMP considered that the effects on motility seen in rats and mice 
constituted a peripheral rather than centrally-mediated effect, as only minor amounts of teriflunomide 
penetrated  the  blood/brain-barrier  (brain/blood  ratio  was  ≤ 2 %).  With  respect  to  cardiovascular 
safety,  the  CHMP  considered  that  no  influence  on  cardiac  conduction  was  apparent  in  safety 
pharmacology and toxicology studies in dogs or during thorough clinical evaluation of the teriflunomide 
effects  on  the  QT  interval  and  hence,  the  in  vitro  findings  were  regarded  to  be  without  relevance  for 
the intended clinical therapy. The CHMP noted that the increased diuresis observed in a supplementary 
study  was  in  agreement  with  pollakiuria,  which  was  frequently  seen  during  clinical  treatment  and 
consequently included as a common adverse reaction in the Product Information. 
Pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  not  performed  in  animals  since  they  were  not 
considered  pertinent  by  the  applicant  for  the  evaluation  of  the  pharmacological  profile  or  the 
mechanism  of  action  of  teriflunomide.  Considering  the  specific  mechanism  of  action  of  teriflunomide 
and the confirmed absence of significant interaction with a panel of more than 100 receptors, this was 
agreed by the CHMP. 
Teriflunomide  showed  consistently  high  oral  bioavailability  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  and  revealed 
comparably extensive protein binding of more than 96 % in animals and man. The calculated volume 
of  distribution  was  based  on  an  assumption  that  drug  elimination  occurs  solely  from  the  central 
compartment.  As  this  could  not  be  confirmed  for  teriflunomide,  the  initial  calculation  led  to  an 
underestimation  of  the  true  Vss.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  this  warranted  a  reference 
within section 5.2 of the SmPC as follows: “... However, this (the volume of distribution) is most likely 
an underestimation since extensive organ distribution was observed in rats.” 
All human metabolites were identified in at least one animal species and teriflunomide was found to be 
predominantly  excreted  by  faeces  in  mice,  rats,  dogs  and  humans.  However,  drug  accumulation  of 
teriflunomide was noted following multiple administrations. In view of the reproduction toxicity of the 
compound  as  further  discussed  below,  the  CHMP  considered  that  women  who  are  pregnant  or  are 
planning a pregnancy should be advised to perform a rapid elimination procedure as outlined in section 
4.4 of the SmPC. 
While it is not known whether teriflunomide is excreted in human milk, it was found to be excreted into 
milk  in  lactating  rats.  Considering  the  potential  for  serious  adverse  reactions  in  nursing  infants,  the 
CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  teriflunomide  must  not  be  administered  during  breast-feeding,  which  is 
reflected in sections 4.3 and 4.6 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP acknowledged that animals in toxicity studies could not be exposed to equivalent or higher 
levels of teriflunomide compared to those achieved during clinical therapy and that for this reason, no 
safety  margins  could  be  established.    Nevertheless,  the  toxicity  findings  predominantly  reflected  the 
anti-proliferative  action  of  the  compound  on  rapidly  dividing  cells,  such  as  decreased  erythropoiesis 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013

and granulopoiesis in bone marrow, atrophy of lymphoid organs, epithelial degeneration in oral cavity 
and gastrointestinal tract as well as tubular degeneration in testes and atrophy of ovary. Consequent 
to  the  haematopoietic  changes  in  bone  marrow,  anaemia,  leukopenia,  lymphocytopenia  and 
thrombocytopenia  developed,  which  presumably  caused  comorbidities  like  impaired  coagulation, 
haemorrhages,  hemosiderosis  and  bacterial  infections.  As  compensatory  mechanisms  indicative  of 
regeneration,  increased  haematopoiesis  in  bone  marrow  and  in  extramedullary  regions  of  the  spleen 
were  found.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  major  non-clinical  findings  were  adequately  reflected  in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Furthermore,  enlarged  livers  were  identified  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs  with  concomitant  elevations  of 
transaminases  in  some  of  these  species.  Mechanistic  studies  implied  that  teriflunomide  exerts  a  low 
hepatotoxic potential by uncoupling the mitochondrial respiratory chain from ATP synthesis leading to 
increased  formation  of  superoxide  anions.  The  resulting  oxidative  damage  might  additionally  account 
for  the  increased  formation  of  Heinz  bodies  in  red  blood  cells  and  incidence  of  methaemoglobinemia, 
which  was  also  observed  with  the  minor  metabolites  4-TFMA  and  A813226.  The  CHMP  considered 
plausible  that  the  cytotoxic  activity  resides  in  the  aniline  moiety  of  teriflunomide  and  its  metabolites, 
because  oxidative  damage  including  methaemoglobinemia  is  known  from  toxicity  studies  with  aniline 
(e.g.  Khan  et al.,  1997).  Since  transaminase  elevations  were  also  detected  in  clinical  trials  with 
teriflunomide,  they  were  included  in  the  risk  management  plan  and  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment are contraindicated as reflected in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
In the chronic toxicity study in dogs, minimal to moderate pancreatic acinar degeneration, necrosis of 
individual acinar cells, fibrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells were detected at oral teriflunomide 
doses  ≥ 0.8 mg/kg/day.  These  cellular  alterations  were  accompanied  by  reduced  TLI  in  the  study 
animals, whereas other pancreatic enzyme levels remained unchanged. The pancreas toxicity could be 
evoked by the mitochondrial toxicity of teriflunomide via inhibition of mitochondrial DHO-DH leading to 
pyrimidine  deficiency,  mitochondrial  DNA  depletion  and  oxidative  stress.  Duct  cells  of  the  exocrine 
pancreas  might  be  sensitive  for  mitochondrial  toxicity,  since  these  cells  contain  numerous 
mitochondria.  The  duct  cells  lining  the  ampulla  of  Vater  might  be  even  more  sensitive  to  this  toxic 
effect,  since  they  are  continuously  exposed  due  to  the  enterohepatic  circulation  of  teriflunomide. 
However,  similar  to  dogs,  pancreatic  enzymes  were  found  to  be  generally  unaffected  in  clinical  trials 
and there was no clear correlation between incidences of pancreatitis and teriflunomide administration. 
As  dogs  seem  to  be  more  responsive  to  teriflunomide  treatment  than  humans  or  are  at  least  of 
comparable  sensitivity,  the  significance  of  the  rather  mild  pancreatic  toxicity  findings  in  dogs  is 
uncertain.  
With  respect  to  the  minor  teriflunomide  metabolites  4-TFMA  and  A813226  the  CHMP  noted  that  the 
toxicity findings were similar to those related to teriflunomide. The CHMP considered that the impaired 
erythropoiesis  might  be  explained  by  the  anti-proliferative  activities  of  the  metabolites  and  could 
additionally  reflect  their  ability  to  uncouple  the  mitochondrial  respiratory  chain  from  ATP  synthesis 
resulting  in  oxidative  haemolysis,  which  has  been  implicated  in  mechanistic  studies  with  the  parent 
compound.  Despite  the  potential  to  contribute  to  the  toxicities  of  teriflunomide,  the  general  levels  of 
A813226 (approximately 3 %) and 4-TFMA (0.01-0.07 % in the different species) were low in relation 
to exposure of the parent compound and therefore, these findings were considered of minor relevance 
for clinical practice. 
The CHMP considered that teriflunomide was extensively tested for genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo as 
described in section 2.3.4. All tests were negative except for the in vitro chromosome aberration assay 
in  human  lymphocytes.  The  applicant  proposed  nucleotide  imbalance  through  the  pharmacological 
mechanism,  DHO-DH  inhibition,  as  the  probable  reason  for  the  positive  in vitro  results.  In  order  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013

confirm the proposed mechanism, two repeated experiments with uridine supplementation at 500 and 
1000 µM  were  performed  in  an  in vitro  study.  Although  the  evidence  provided  for  the  proposed 
induction  of  nucleotide  imbalance  as  the  probable  reason  for  the  positive  results  in  the  in vitro 
clastogenicity test was not convincing (as significant effect of uridine supplementation on reduction of 
chromosome  damage  and  cytotoxicity  was  not  observed),  the  CHMP  did  not  consider  this  in  vitro 
finding relevant for the in vivo situation. In particular, the CHMP took into account that all in vivo tests 
were  clearly  negative  up  to  the  MTD  providing  sufficiently  high  exposure  for  teriflunomide  and  the 
metabolite  4-TFMA.  Moreover,  teriflunomide  was  negative  for  induction  of  gene  mutation  in  bacteria 
and  mammalian  cells  and  therefore,  it  was  considered  not  to  be  a  direct  DNA  reactive  substance. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  teriflunomide  did  not  possess  a  clinically  relevant  genotoxic 
potential,  which  was  further  substantiated  by  the  absence  of  treatment-related  neoplastic  effects  in 
long-term studies in mice and rats.  
The  CHMP  also  considered  that  metabolites  4-TFMA  and  A813226  did  not  show  clinically  relevant 
genotoxic  potential.  While  4-TFMA  caused  mutagenicity  and  clastogenicity  in  vitro,  the  findings  were 
negative in in vivo tests.  The reason why effects in vivo were not observed up to lethal doses might be 
that concentrations positive in vitro are most probably not achievable in vivo below acute lethal doses 
in animal experiments. As 4-TFMA exposure is very low in humans, 4-TFMA was not considered to pose 
a biologically relevant mutagenic potential in humans.  
The CHMP considered that the relevant genotoxicity findings were adequately reflected in section 5.3 of 
the SmPC. 
The long term carcinogenicity studies with oral administration of teriflunomide in mice and rats did not 
reveal  treatment-related  neoplastic  effects  and  the  CHMP  concluded  that  there  was  no  relevant 
evidence of a carcinogenic potential of teriflunomide.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  lack  of  evidence  of  carcinogenicity  was  reflected  adequately  in  section 
5.3 of the SmPC. 
In reproduction toxicity investigations, no adverse effects of teriflunomide on male and female fertility 
were  apparent,  although  a  reduced  sperm  count  was  evident.  However,  in  the  female  fertility  study 
teriflunomide  did  not  reach  the  anticipated  concentrations  in  half  of  the  animals  at  study  initiation. 
Nevertheless,  the  dosing  schedule  ensured  that  the  other  half  of  animals  were  sufficiently  dosed  and 
the  maternal  toxicities  observed  in  the  high  dose  group  suggested  appropriate  dose  selection  in 
compliance with the ICH S5 recommendations. 
The CHMP considered that teriflunomide was embryo-toxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 
in the human therapeutic range. In the embryo-foetal toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, teriflunomide 
evoked  embryo-lethality  and  malformations  at  daily  doses  > 1 mg/kg.  In  the  pre-  and  postnatal 
development  study,  malformations  were  detected  in  the  F1  generation  at  daily  doses  of  0.3 mg/kg. 
However,  no  effects  on  survival,  behaviour  and  reproductive  performance  of  the  F1  generation  were 
observed.    The  no-teratogenic  risk  level  for  teriflunomide  in  humans  is  proposed  in  the  SmPC  as 
0.25 µg/ml.  Applying  an  additional  10-fold  safety  factor,  this  corresponds  to  an  AUC 0-24h  of 
6 μg∙h/ml/day. Consequently, women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during 
teriflunomide  therapy  as  reflected  in  sections  4.3  and  4.6  of  the  SmPC.  Due  to  the  aforementioned 
drug  persistence,  CHMP  additionally  advised  that  women  of  childbearing  potential  continue 
contraception  even  after  a  stop  of  teriflunomide  dosing  until  plasma  concentrations  have  reached 
0.02 μg/ml,  which  can  be  accelerated  by  a  rapid  elimination  procedure  with  cholestyramine  or 
activated charcoal powder as reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC.

In  the  male  fertility  study,  teriflunomide  did  not  affect  the  mean  numbers  of  corpora  lutea, 
implantation  sites,  post-implantation  loss,  mean  number  of  live  foetuses,  foetal  sex  ratio  and  mean 
foetal weight. Moreover, no compound-related external malformations and/or anomalies were noted in 
any  dose  group.  As  the  estimated  female  drug  exposure  across  the  semen  is  approximately  100-fold 
lower  than  the  plasma  exposure  at  the  recommended  daily  oral  dose  of  teriflunomide,  the  CHMP 
considered that the risk of male-mediated embryo-foetal toxicity is low. This information is reflected in 
sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Local  tolerance  of  teriflunomide  was  extensively  investigated  by  the  applicant.  The  results  of  these 
studies,  showing  no  irritation,  sensitisation  or  phototoxic  potential,  contributed  to  defining  the  safety 
profile of the compound, but were seen as of minor relevance in view of the intended oral therapy in 
patients.  
In terms of the environmental risk, the CHMP considered that the n-octanol/water partition coefficient 
for  teriflunomide  was  below  4.5  in  two  studies  and  hence  agreed  that  there  was  no  need  for  further 
screening of teriflunomide for persistence, bioaccumulation or toxicity and that the environmental risk 
assessment may be stopped in phase I.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that,  in  view  of  the  presumptively  higher  sensitivity  of  animals  as 
compared  to  man,  results  of  non-clinical  safety  studies  have  limitations  to  predict  safety  risks  in 
humans. Nevertheless, the CHMP took into consideration that the adverse effects observed in the non-
clinical  program  of  teriflunomide  were  appropriately  reflected  in  the  Product  Information  and    Risk 
Management  Plan  and  considered  that  there  were  no  non-clinical  issues  precluding  granting  of  a 
marketing authorisation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A  total  of  55  studies  were  performed  to  study  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of 
teriflunomide,  18  of  which  were  clinical  pharmacology  studies  conducted  in  healthy  subjects,  special 
populations and MS patients. 
Absorption 
The  absolute  bioavailability  was  calculated  by  cross  study  comparison.  Bioavailability  of  teriflunomide 
was  high  (approximately  100%)  after  oral  intake  due  to  its  high  permeability.  Plasma  teriflunomide 
concentrations peaked at a median time of 1 to 4 hours, independent of dose and dosing day.  
Based  on  the  PopPK  analysis  (Study  POH0290),  for  the  proposed  dose  of  14  mg  teriflunomide,  the 
steady-state  C max    was  45.3  µg/ml  and  the  steady-state  AUC 0-24  was  1070  µg/ml.  Based  on  the 
observed data in the different studies in MS patients, the steady state C trough/min    ranged from 37.4 to 
65.8 µg/ml. 
Food  significantly  reduced  C max  by  18%  for  both  doses,  but  did  not  significantly  reduce  the  exposure 
(AUC 0-72). The tmax (1.5-4.2 h versus 6.25-20 h, with and without food, respectively) was prolonged 2-
4 fold.  
Dose proportionality with single doses of 7 and 14 mg, reflected in C max and AUC values, was shown in 
healthy subjects and with repeated oral dosing in MS patients based on the C trough values. Of note, the 
dose-proportional increase in the plasma levels was not reflected in efficacy. 
From the mean predicted pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from the population pharmacokinetic 
(PopPK)  analysis  using  data  from  healthy  volunteers  and  MS  patients,  there  was  a  slow  approach  to 
steady-state  concentration  (i.e.,  approximately  100  days  (3.5  months)  to  attain  95%  of  steady-state 
concentrations) and the estimated AUC accumulation ratio was approximately 34-fold.

Distribution 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  human  data  showed  that  teriflunomide  was  extensively  bound  to  plasma  protein 
(>99%)  and  was  mainly distributed  in  the  plasma.  Drug  interactions  due  to  displacement  from  other 
proteins are considered unlikely. 
Data from the single i.v. administration of teriflunomide (Study HWA486/1024) showed a limited Vss of 
11  l.  This  was  in  line  with  the  PopPK  analysis  results  using  data  from  the  Phase  3  studies  2001  and 
EFC6049/TEMSO. 
Elimination 
The primary biotransformation pathway for teriflunomide was hydrolysis. Secondary pathways involved 
oxidation,  N-acetylation  and  sulfate  conjugation.  Teriflunomide  was  moderately  metabolized  into 
several  metabolites.  TFMA  was  not  detected  in  the  human  in  vivo  metabolism  study  (BEX6038),  but 
was detected in low amounts in plasma after repeated doses in clinical studies. TFMA glycolanilide and 
4-TFMA oxalinic acid were formed in vitro after incubation of teriflunomide in human liver microsomes 
(Study  HMR014997).  4-TFMA  oxalinic  acid  was  also  formed  after  incubation  of  4-TFMA  in  vitro  in 
human hepatocytes (Study HMR017949).  
Most  of  the  metabolites  were  undetectable  in  humans  and  the  metabolites  which  could  be  detected 
were not considered of relevance due to their minute amounts. 
Based on individual prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters using the PopPK model of teriflunomide 
in healthy volunteers and MS patients, teriflunomide half-life was approximately 19 days after repeated 
doses  of  14 mg.  After  a  single  i.v.  administration,  the  total  body  clearance  of  teriflunomide  was 
30.5 ml/h. 
Teriflunomide  was  eliminated  via  faeces  by  37.5%  of  the  administered  dose  (35.7%  was  the 
unchanged  drug)  and  via  urine  by  22.6%  (≤1.3%  was  the  unchanged  drug).  Non-clinical  data  (from 
intra-duodenal  administration  of  teriflunomide  in  rats)  and  the  human  in  vivo  observation  of  the 
presence  of  unchanged  drug  excreted  in  faeces  at  time  points  after  72  hours  indicated  that  biliary 
secretion and possibly direct gastro-intestinal secretion leading to entero-hepatic recycling are involved 
in  elimination  process.  The  direct  secretion  might  be  mediated  by  the  efflux  transporter  BCRP,  as 
teriflunomide is its substrate. 
Based  on  the  PopPK  analysis,  bilirubin  showed  an  effect  of  a  1.7-fold  increase  of  mean  AUC 0-24SS 
between patients with a bilirubin value greater than 17 µmol/l (n=17) and patients with bilirubin value 
lower than 17 µmol/l (n=393).  
The  elimination  of  teriflunomide  can  be  accelerated  by  the  oral  administration  of  cholestyramine  or 
activated  charcoal,  presumably  by  interrupting  the  reabsorption  processes  at  the  intestinal  level. 
Teriflunomide  concentrations  measured  during  an  11-day  procedure  to  accelerate  teriflunomide 
elimination  with  either  4  g  cholestyramine  every  8  hours,  8  g  cholestyramine  every  8  hours,  or  50  g 
activated  charcoal  every  6  hours  following  cessation  of  teriflunomide  treatment  indicated  that  these 
regimens were effective in accelerating teriflunomide elimination, leading to more than 98% decrease 
in plasma teriflunomide concentrations, with cholestyramine being faster than activated charcoal.

Special populations 
Several sources of intrinsic variability were identified in healthy subjects and MS patients based on the 
PopPK  analysis:  age,  body  weight,  gender,  race,  and  albumin  and  bilirubin  levels,  but  their  impact 
remained  limited  (≤31%).  No  data  were  available  on  children.  Mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment 
had  no  impact  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  teriflunomide.  No  impact  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
teriflunomide was seen in patients with severe renal impairment.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The  in  vivo  data  on  the  pharmacokinetic  interaction  of  rifampin  (an  inducer  for  CYP2B6,  2C8,  2C9, 
2C19, 3A P-gp and BCRP) with teriflunomide showed a reduction of teriflunomide AUC by about 40%.  
The  in  vivo  data  on  the  pharmacokinetic  interaction  of  teriflunomide  with  other  drugs  showed  that 
teriflunomide  moderately  inhibited  CYP2C8  and  weakly  inhibited  CYP3A,  but  did  not  inhibit  CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  and  CYP2D6.  Repeated  doses  of  teriflunomide  decreased  mean  Cmax  and  AUC  of

caffeine  (CYP1A2  substrate)  by  18%  and  55%,  respectively,  suggesting  that  teriflunomide  may  be  a 
weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo.  
Repeated  doses  of  teriflunomide  had  no  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  S-warfarin,  indicating  that 
teriflunomide is not an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2C9.  
In vitro, teriflunomide was observed to be an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9.  
There was an increase in mean Cmax and AUC (1.43- and 1.54-fold, respectively) of cefaclor (an OAT3 
substrate)  following  repeated  doses  of  teriflunomide,  suggesting  that  teriflunomide  is  an  inhibitor  of 
OAT3 in vivo. An increase in mean Cmax and AUC (2.65- and 2.51-fold, respectively) was also observed 
for  rosuvastatin  (a  multiple  substrate  for  OAT3,  BCRP,  OATP1B1/B3)  following  repeated  doses  of 
teriflunomide.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Teriflunomide  is  an  immunomodulatory  agent  with  anti-inflammatory  properties  that  selectively  and 
reversibly inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DH), required for the 
de novo pyrimidine synthesis. As a consequence teriflunomide reduces the proliferation of dividing cells 
that  need  de  novo  synthesis  of  pyrimidine  to  expand.  The  exact  mechanism  by  which  teriflunomide 
exerts its therapeutic effect in MS is not fully understood, but this is mediated by a reduced number of 
lymphocytes.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary  pharmacology  studies  and  systematic  dose-finding  studies  were  not  performed.  The  doses  of 
teriflunomide  7  mg/day  and  teriflunomide  14  mg/day  were  selected  based  on  the  doses  active  in 
animal  EAE  models  and  on  pharmacokinetic  data  obtained  with  leflunomide  (Arava).    Teriflunomide 
exposure after a single 20 mg dose of leflunomide was about 70% of that after a single 20 mg dose of 
teriflunomide (Study 1001). 
The pharmacodynamics and PK/PD relationship were investigated in three studies.  
•  Study  TES10852:  a  placebo  and  positive-controlled  study  on  the  effect  of  teriflunomide  on 
ventricular repolarization in healthy subjects.  
•  Study  POH0295:  an  exploratory  analysis  of  the  PK-PD  based  on  the  data  from  studies 
HMR1726D/2001 and EFC6049/TEMSO. 
•  Study  PDY11684:  a  secondary  pharmacology  study  to  evaluate  teriflunomide  effects  on  the 
immune response to vaccination in patients with relapsing MS 
Study  (PDY11684)  was  on-going  at  the  time  of  the  initial  MAA.  It  was  aimed  to  investigate  whether 
teriflunomide  treatment  affects  the  immune  response  to  vaccination  in  patients  with  relapsing  MS.  It 
was hypothesized that memory response to a recall antigen may be preserved, since memory T cells 
may not need de novo pyrimidine synthesis following re-activation to trigger antibody response. 
In Study TES10852, the effect of teriflunomide on ventricular repolarization was evaluated in terms of 
change  from  time-matched  baseline  in  QT  (primary  variable),  calculated  using  Fridericia’s  formula 
(QTcF).  This  was  analysed  as  the  largest  time-matched  mean  difference  (LTMMD)  between 
teriflunomide  and  placebo  over  Day  12,  using  specific  time  points  over  12h.  Teriflunomide  effects  on 
Assessment report

secondary variables, e.g. heart rate, were measured. The clinical laboratory parameters, such as uric 
acid elimination on 24-hour urine collection and serum uric acid levels were also analysed. 
No  QTcF  prolongation  was  observed  at  a  mean  Cmax  steady  state  concentration  of  30  μg/ml  (a 
concentration within the range observed in MS patients). Heart rate was not affected by teriflunomide, 
either. A decrease in serum uric acid levels and increased urinary clearance were observed, which was 
in line with data from Phase 2/3 studies and also supported by literature (Toncev et al. 2002).  
The PK-PD relationship was explored in Study POH0295 using data from studies HMR1726D/2001 and 
EFC6049/TEMSO.  The  relationship  between  the  mean  teriflunomide  concentration  after  8  weeks  of 
treatment (independent variable) and several efficacy and safety variables (dependent variables) was 
modelled.  Different  models  were  used  depending  on  the  properties  of  the  dependent  variable 
(continuous/categorical).  Results  on  the  efficacy  variables  indicated  that  there  was  no  significant 
relationship  between  mean  teriflunomide  concentrations  and  annual  relapse  rate  or  MRI  burden  of 
disease.  A  statistically  significant  decrease  in  risk  of  disability  progression,  as  mean  teriflunomide 
concentration  increases,  was  found.  For  the  number  of  Gadolinium-enhanced  T1  lesions  and  the 
number  of  unique  active  lesions,  the  relationship  to  mean  teriflunomide  concentration  could  not  be 
reliably predicted. 
With  respect  to  safety  variables,  no  significant  relationship  was  seen  between  mean  teriflunomide 
concentrations  and  lipase,  systolic  blood  pressure  and  creatinine  clearance.  A  trend  towards  effect 
dependent  on  the  dose  was  observed  in  some  other  safety  variables,  e.g.  alanine  aminotransferase, 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, amylase, diastolic blood pressure, alopecia, phosphate and uric acid. 
Pharmacodynamic  interactions  with  other  medicinal  products  were  investigated  in  two  studies  (Study 
PDY6045 and Study LTS6047) as a tertiary objective. Study PDY6045 evaluated the effects of a 7 mg 
and  14  mg  dose  of  teriflunomide  compared  with  placebo,  in  combination  with  a  stable  dose  of  IFN-
beta,  on  interferon  neutralizing  antibodies  for  24  weeks.  Study  LTS6047  was  an  extension  of  study 
PDY6045 and PDY6046 (add-on treatment with glatiramer acetate), with continued double-blind design 
for  at  least  another  24  weeks.  The  number  and  proportion  of  patients  with  IFN-beta  neutralizing 
antibodies  (NAb)  by  visit  and  by  treatment  group  for  PDY6045  +  LTS6047  were  tabulated. 
Pharmacodynamic-neutralizing  antibodies  relationship  was  investigated  on  efficacy  parameters  such 
relapse rate and MRI variables. 
Overall,  in  both  studies,  no  significant  effects  on  the  proportion  of  NAb  negative  patients  (NAb  <20 
Titre) were observed with add-on treatment of INF-beta and teriflunomide (for both doses) or placebo 
at week 24 and 48. No conclusions on the correlation between neutralizing antibody and efficacy could 
be made due to the low power of the studies (small sample size). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In  general,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  documentation  adequately  characterised  the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of teriflunomide.  
In  their  review,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  steady-state  levels  of  teriflunomide  were  reached  in 
about  3-3.5  months  and  therefore,  relapse  prevention  could  be  suboptimal  in  the  period  towards  the 
steady  state,  which  might  warrant  a  loading  dose.  In  this  context,  the  applicant  presented  a 
cumulative  occurrence  of  relapses  over  time  for  the  TEMSO  study  and  combined  for  the  TEMSO  + 
TOWER  study.  The  results  indicated  an  early  separation  of  the  curves  between  the  placebo  and 
teriflunomide  groups.  In  addition,  the  applicant  presented  data  on  the  cumulative  mean  number  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 31/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
combined unique active lesions over the study period in study 2001. The combined unique lesions were 
decreased  in  teriflunomide-treated  patients  already  at  6  weeks,  reaching  significance  by  12  weeks. 
With  an  initial  loading  dose  (double  dose  at  week  1)  administered  in  this  study,  the  plasma  through 
concentrations were not significantly changed as compared to subjects without an initial loading dose. 
Taken  together,  the  evidence  presented  by  the  applicant  was  considered  to  provide  reassurance  that 
there was no delay in the onset of action and hence, a loading dose was not requested by the CHMP. 
The CHMP also considered the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic parameters of teriflunomide, i.e. 
significantly  reduced  Cmax,  prolonged  tmax  and  no  significant  reduction  in  exposure  (AUC0-72).  In 
view of the long-half life (about 20 days), once daily administration and use in chronic treatment, the 
CHMP  agreed  that  the  product  can  be  taken  with  or  without  food  as  reflected  in  section  4.2  of  the 
SmPC. 
Given  the  long  half-life  of  teriflunomide,  rapid  elimination  procedure  by  administration  of 
cholestyramine or activated charcoal was accepted. 
No  significant  difference  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  teriflunomide  was  observed  between  the  healthy 
subjects and those with severe renal impairment. The CHMP considered that this was in line with the 
observation that only less than 2% of the unchanged drug is excreted in the urine. Overall, the CHMP 
was of the view that no dose adjustment in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment 
would  be  needed.  Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  pointed  out  that  as  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment 
undergoing dialysis were not evaluated, teriflunomode should be contraindicated in this population. 
With  respect  to  hepatic  impairment,  no  significant  differences  in  exposure  were  observed  in  subjects 
with  mild  and  moderate  condition.  Therefore,  no  dose  adjustment  was  considered  necessary  in  these 
patients.  There  was  no  clinical  trial  experience  with  the  use  of  teriflunomide  in  patients  with  severe 
hepatic  impairment  and  the  applicant  proposed  a  contraindication  for  these  patients.  This  approach 
was agreed by the CHMP and reflected in the Product Information accordingly. 
The  CHMP  considered  the  available  population  PK  analysis  data  and  concluded  that  no  dose 
modifications or precautions according to body weight, age, gender, race and albumin were necessary. 
The finding of an increase of mean AUC0-24SS in patients with bilirubin levels greater than 17 µmol/l 
was not considered to have clinical implications for MS patients. 
In  vitro,  teriflunomide  was  shown  to  be  an  inhibitor  of  CYP1A2  and  CYP2C9,  while  this  was  not 
observed in the in vivo studies. The CHMP considered that it might be attributed to a combined effect 
of  inhibition  and  induction  during  the  repeated  administration  of  teriflunomide  for  11-12  days.  As 
inhibition normally occurs for the first few days and induction later, inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 
might have been masked by the inducing effect. Based on calculated inhibition values provided by the 
applicant,  the  CHMP  considered  that  teriflunomide  was  not  likely  to  exert  inhibitory  effect  on  CYP1A2 
and  CYP2C9  metabolism.    The  CHMP  considered  that  teriflunomide  co-administration  with  caffeine 
weakly  induced  CYP1A2.  Therefore,  medicinal  products  metabolised  by  CYP1A2  (such  as  duloxetin, 
alosetron,  theophylline  and  tizanidine)  should  be  used  with  caution  during  treatment  with 
teriflunomide,  as  it  could  lead  to  the  reduction  of  efficacy  of  these  products.  This  was  reflected  in 
section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Repeated doses of teriflunomide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin, suggesting that 
teriflunomide  is  not  an  inhibitor  or  an  inducer  of  CYP2C9.  However,  a  25%  decrease  in  peak 
international  normalised  ratio  (INR)  was  observed  when  teriflunomide  was  co-administered  with 
warfarin  as  compared  with  warfarin  alone.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  when  warfarin is  co-
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013

administered with teriflunomide, close INR follow-up and monitoring should be ensured, as reflected in 
section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Based  on  the  increase  in  mean  rosuvastatin  Cmax  and  AUC  observed  following  repeated  doses  of 
teriflunomide, a dose reduction by 50% for rosuvastatin was recommended in case co-administration is 
needed. 
With respect to pharmacodynamics, the CHMP considered that  inhibition of proliferation of stimulated 
T- and B-cells has a role in the mechanism of action. However, the claim suggesting that teriflunomide 
exerts its effects only on stimulated lymphocytes and not on slowly dividing or resting cells dependent 
on  pyrimidine  was  not  supported  with  sufficient  data.  In  this  regard,  the  CHMP  also  pointed  out  that 
the adverse event profile, for example incidence of alopecia, was indicative of a lesser specificity that 
suggested  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant  acknowledged  that  there  was  evidence  in  literature  which 
indicates  that  teriflunomide  exerts  inhibitory  effects  not  only  in  activated  T-  and  B-lymphocytes,  but 
also  in  other  proliferating  cell  types.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP  highlighted  that  references  to  reduced 
numbers  of  activated  lymphocytes  specifically  in  the  central  nervous  system  were  not  substantiated 
and requested that this should reflected accordingly in the text of section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  teriflunomide  did  not  show  clinically  relevant  effects  on  ventricular 
repolarization  or  heart  rate.  The  increase  in  uric  acid  clearance  which  was  observed  in  the  QT  study 
was not considered to pose a safety concern. 
The results of study POH0295 evaluating the PK-PD relationship did not show consistent pattern with 
respect to efficacy. In general, the dose-effect on the several efficacy and safety parameters, with the 
exception of primary pharmacological effects, was weak and when present, of limited predictive value. 
The CHMP noted that the lack of relationship between teriflunomide concentration and annual relapse 
rate  was  in  line  with  the  lack  of  dose-effect  relationship  in  the  clinical  studies.  This  issue  is  further 
discussed in the Clinical Efficacy section, with respect to the choice of dose applied for. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted were considered satisfactory. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No  dose-finding  study  in  the  indication  of  relapsing  multiple  sclerosis  was  performed.  Teriflunomide 
doses of 7 and 14 mg tested in the phase II and phase III clinical trials were selected by the applicant 
based  on  doses  active  in  the  animal  EAE  models  and  on  pharmacokinetic  and  clinical  data  obtained 
with the parent compound leflunomide.  
Teriflunomide  exposure  after  a  single 20  mg  dose  of  leflunomide  was  ~70%  of  that  after  a  single  20 
mg dose of teriflunomide. Leflunomide was shown to be effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
at doses of 10 and 20 mg. In the phase 2 of development of leflunomide, higher incidences of adverse 
events  were  observed  with  the  dose  of  25  mg  and  consequently,  the  decision  was  made  to  test  the 
doses  of  10  mg  and  20  mg  of  leflunomide  in  Phase  3  studies.  These  results  were  also  taken  into 
account  for  the  development  of  teriflunomide  and  the  decision  was  made  not  to  test  doses  of 
teriflunomide higher than 14 mg.

The  applicant  made  a  presumption  of  a  1:1  transmission  of  effective  doses  developed  in  RA  to  MS 
referring to the hypothesis that in both indications, the effect of teriflunomide on the DHO-DH enzyme 
would result in a clinical effect.  
The CHMP discussion regarding absence of formal dose-finding studies is summarised in section 2.6.3. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The  applicant  developed  teriflunomide  as  a  disease-modifying  drug  for  multiple  sclerosis,  with  the 
primary aim to investigate teriflunomide as a monotherapy in the treatment of patients with relapsing 
forms  of  MS.  The  following  studies  were  considered  by  the  CHMP  as  the  most  important  for  this 
marketing authorization application. 
Of  note,  the  patient  populations  within  studies  2001,  TEMSO,  TOWER  and  TENERE  were  comparable 
and  there  were  no  relevant  differences  between  the  treatment  arms  in  these  studies  with  respect  to 
medical history and concomitant diseases. 
HMR1726D/2001 - A phase II study of the safety and efficacy of teriflunomide (HMR1726) 
in multiple sclerosis with relapses 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Male  or  female  subjects  aged  between  18  and  65  years,  with  clinically  definite  MS  with  at  least  2 
documented relapses as defined by the Poser criteria in the 3 years prior to screening could be enrolled 
in the study. At least 1 relapse had to be documented in the last year and the patients had to have a 
screening MRI scan fulfilling the criteria for a diagnosis of MS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS) score between 0 and 6 inclusively. 
Treatments 
The  trial included  a  4-week,  treatment-free  screening  period  with  MRI  scans  at  week  -4  (visit  1)  and 
baseline (visit 3), a 36-week double-blind treatment period (visits 4 to 10) with 6 additional MRI scans 
performed  every  6  weeks  and  a  6-week,  post-treatment  observation  period  with  a  final  MRI  scan  at 
week 42 (visit 11). 
Adults with clinically definite MS with relapses, based on MRI scans taken during the screening phase, 
were  randomized  (1:1:1)  to  1  of  3  treatment  groups  (placebo,  7  mg  or  14  mg  teriflunomide  once 
daily). Study medication was to be administered orally once daily with or without food. Subjects were 
encouraged  to  take  their  tablets  (placebo,  7  or  14  mg  teriflunomide)  at  the  same  time  each  day.  In 
each of the 3 groups, subjects were to take a daily loading dose of 2 tablets for the first 7 days of the 
treatment  period,  followed  by  a  maintenance  dose  of  1  tablet  daily  for  the  remaining  days  of  the 
treatment phase.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety and efficacy of teriflunomide in multiple 
sclerosis  with  relapses.  The  secondary  objectives  were  focused  on  the  effect  of  teriflunomide  on 
additional MRI variables, clinical and quality of life measures. Furthermore, the PK-PD relationship was 
investigated.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  defined  as  the  average  number  of  unique  active  lesions  per  MRI 
scan  for  the  double-blind  treatment  period  of  the  study  (sum  of  unique  newly  active  lesions  and  of 
unique persistently active lesions for all scans divided by the number of scans on which the sum was 
based). This average was based on all scans performed during the treatment period. 
Secondary endpoints were based on MRI scans (average number of new T1 lesions per scan, average 
number  of  new  T2  lesions  per  scan,  average  number  of  newly  active  lesions  per  scan  (T1  and  T2 
combined), average number of persistently active lesions per scan (T1 and  T2 combined), number of 
subjects  with  no  new  lesion,  number  of  subjects  with  no newly  enhancing lesion,  number  of  subjects 
with  no  new  unique  active  lesion,  percentage  of  scans  per  subject  showing  no  enhancement, 
percentage  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  the  burden  of  disease  and  percentage  change  from 
baseline in atrophy at week 36), clinical assessments (focusing on changes in EDSS score, MSFC score 
and relapses) and quality of life variables (fatigue impact scale and MSQOL-54). 
Sample size 
Fifty four evaluable subjects per treatment group were considered sufficient to detect with 90% power 
an effect size of 0.32 using a 2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and at α-level of 0.05. This effect size for 
the  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  corresponds  to  a  parametric  effect  size  of  0.67.  Anticipating  a  10% 
dropout rate, it was considered necessary to randomize 60 subjects per treatment group for a total of 
180 subjects. 
Blinding and randomisation 
The study was conducted in a double-blind fashion. The patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio with 
blocks  of  six.  Randomization  of  subjects  was  stratified  on  the  basis  of  EDSS  scores.  Subjects  with  a 
score  ≤  3.5  were  randomized  in  ascending  order  beginning  with  the  lowest  number;  subjects  with  a 
score >3.5 were randomized in descending order beginning with the highest number.  
Randomisation occurred at visit 3 after completion of all baseline assessments.  
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis populations were defined as follows: 
• Efficacy-evaluable: All randomized subjects for whom there was at least 1 on-treatment MRI 
assessment 
• Safety-evaluable: All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication  
The primary efficacy variable (average number of unique active lesions per MRI scan for the treatment 
period) was analysed for differences between treatment groups using rank analysis of covariance with 
treatment,  stratum  (EDSS  at  baseline  ≤  3.5  vs.  >3.5)  and  pooled  centre  as  fixed  effects  and  the 
ranked  average  pre-randomization  number  of  unique  active  lesions  as  covariate.  Dunnett’s  test  for 
comparing 2 groups with placebo was used.

Recruitment 
The study took place between 26 April 2001 and 17 March 2003. 
Conduct of the study 
Major  protocol  deviations  were  identified  in  30  (16.9%)  of  the  177  treated  subjects  in  the  efficacy-
evaluable  population:  8/61  (13.1%)  in  the  placebo  group,  9/60  (15.0%)  in  the  7  mg  teriflunomide 
group  and  13/56  (23.2%)  in  the  14  mg  teriflunomide  group.  The  most  common  deviation  was  the 
wrong application of gadolinium or the use of other drugs for the treatment of relapses that interfered 
with the interpretation of the MRI scans. This was the case for 8/61  (13.1%) subjects  in the placebo 
group, 7/60 (11.7%) subjects in the 7 mg teriflunomide group and 10/56 (17.9%) subjects in the 14 
mg teriflunomide group.  
Baseline data and Numbers analysed 
179 patients with relapsing MS from two countries were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, 7 mg 
teriflunomide  or  14  mg  teriflunomide  for  a  36-week  double-blind  treatment  period.  Most  of  the 
included  patients  were  patients  with  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (155  patients);  there  were 
also  around  12.4%  patients  in  every  treatment  group  with  secondary  progressive  MS  (SPMS). 
Generally, the included patients were patients with a rather mild disease form (median baseline EDSS: 
2.0-2.5, number of relapses in the last year: 1).  
Outcomes and estimation 
With respect to the primary endpoint, the mean number of unique active lesions per MRI scan during 
the  treatment  period  was  2.69  for  placebo,  1.06  for  7  mg  teriflunomide  and  0.98  for  14  mg 
teriflunomide.  Both  teriflunomide  treatment  arms  demonstrated  statistically  significant  differences  in 
comparison to placebo (placebo vs. 7 mg teriflunomide: p = 0.0234, placebo vs. 14 mg teriflunomide: 
p  =  0.0052)  in  the  primary  analysis  population,  i.e.  the  efficacy-evaluable  population.  These  results 
were  supported  by  analyses  in  the  ITT  population  and  the  completer  population.  In  a  sensitivity 
Assessment report

analysis  based  on  the  PP  population,  the  teriflunomide  7  mg  treatment  arm  did  not  reach  statistical 
significance  when  compared  to  placebo  (p  =  0.1099).  For  the  14  mg  teriflunomide  dose,  borderline 
statistical significance in comparison to placebo (p = 0.0490) was achieved. 
The average numbers of MRI lesions during the treatment period were significantly lower for patients 
treated  with  teriflunomide  14  mg  in  comparison  to  the  placebo  group  for  most  of  the  lesion  types 
analysed  (except  new  enlarging  T2  lesions,  persistently  enlarging  T2  lesions  and  unique  persistently 
active  lesions  (T1  and  T2)).  Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  in  the  completer  and  the  PP 
population. Analyses did not always support the results of the primary analysis. 
The number of subjects with no unique newly active lesions during the treatment period did not reach 
statistical significance in any of the active treatment groups when compared to placebo, but was higher 
on  active  treatment  (12  (19.7%)  placebo  subjects,  21  (35.0%)  7  mg  teriflunomide  subjects  and  20 
(35.7%) 14 mg teriflunomide subjects). 
Median  percent  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  burden  of  disease  (defined  as  the  sum  of  all 
regions  of  interest  identified  on  T2  scans)  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  for  the  7  mg 
teriflunomide  group  (p  =  0.0959)  when  compared  to  placebo,  but  reached  statistical  significance  for 
the 14 mg teriflunomide group (p = 0.0215) in comparison to placebo. 
Generally,  the  annual  relapse  rate  was  rather  low  in  all  treatment  groups  (0.81  for  placebo,  0.58  for 
teriflunomide 7 mg and 0.55 for teriflunomide 14 mg). The numbers of patients with MS relapses and 
the  number  of  patients  with  relapses  requiring  steroid  treatment  were  lowest  in  the  14  mg  group. 
There  was  a  trend  for  positive  results  for  the  two  doses  on  proportion  of  patients  with  MS  relapses 
(37.7%,  35.0%  and  23.2%  respectively  for  placebo,  7mg  and  14  mg).  This  was  not  statistically 
significant.  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  EDSS  progression  was  statistically  significantly  lower  in  the  14  mg 
group  than  on  placebo,  but  the  7  mg  group  was  higher  than  the  placebo  group  without  statistically 
significant difference (subjects with progression on EDSS: placebo 21.3%, 7 mg teriflunomide 28.8%, 
and 14 mg teriflunomide 7.4%, respectively).  
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  from  baseline  on  any  of  the  patient-reported  outcomes  or 
quality of life scores (FIS, MSFC, SF-36 or EQ-5D).  
EFC6049  (TEMSO)  -  A  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  design 
study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  teriflunomide  (HMR1726D)  in  reducing  the 
frequency  of  relapses  and  delaying  the  accumulation  of  physical  disability  in  subjects  with 
multiple sclerosis with relapses  
Methods 
Study Participants  
To be eligible to participate in the study, the patients had to be between 18-55 years old, meeting the 
McDonald´s criteria (2005) for MS diagnosis, with an EDSS score of ≤5.5, exhibiting a relapsing clinical 
course  with  or  without  progression.  The  patients  had  to  have  at  least  1  relapse  over  the  1  year 
preceding the trial or at least 2 relapses over the 2 years preceding the trial. Patients with significantly 
impaired bone marrow function or significant anaemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, patients with 
congenital  or  acquired  immunodeficiency,  malignancies  or  patients  with  liver  or  renal  function 
impairment  could  not  be  enrolled.      In  addition,  patients  were  not  eligible  for  entry  into  the  study  if 
they met any of the following criteria: known history of active tuberculosis, persistent severe infection, 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013

HIV  positivity,  chronic  pancreatitis,  pregnancy  and  breast-feeding.  Prior  or  concomitant  use  of 
natalizumab,  cladribin,  mitoxantron  or  other  immunosuppressive  drugs  was  not  allowed.  Prior  use  of 
interferons,  cytokine  therapy  or  glatiramer  acetate  therapy  was  acceptable  only  if  discontinued  more 
than four months before participation in the study. 
Treatments 
One tablet of placebo, 7 mg teriflunomide or 14 mg teriflunomide was to be taken orally once daily in 
the  morning  for  108  weeks.  The  study  medications  were  to  be  taken  with  or  without  food.  A  dosing 
interruption  less  than  or  equal  to  15  days  was  allowed  for  patients  undergoing  surgical  procedures 
involving  general  anaesthesia;  the  patients  undergoing  surgical  procedures  involving local  or  regional 
anaesthesia were to continue with the study medication without interruption. 
During the study (or for 4 weeks prior to entry) the following treatments were not permitted: systemic 
corticosteroids (except for treatment of acute MS exacerbations as per protocol specifications), ACTH, 
cholestyramine, phenytoin, warfarin, tolbutamide and St. John's Wort products containing hyperforin in 
an unknown percentage or greater than 1% of the extract. 
The  relapses  during  the  study  were  to  be  treated  with  corticosteroids  if  clinically  necessary.  The 
preferred  standardized  treatment  consisted  of  1  g  intravenous  methylprednisolone  sodium  succinate 
daily for 3 to 5 days. Study MRI was not to be performed until after a minimum of 14 days following 
the completion of a course of corticosteroids.  
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  effect  of  teriflunomide  in  reducing  the 
frequency of relapses in subjects with relapsing MS. 
The  secondary  objectives  comprised  evaluating  the  effect  of  teriflunomide  on  delaying  the 
accumulation of disability at 2 years as assessed by the EDSS, evaluating the effects of teriflunomide 
on MRI variables, evaluating the effect of teriflunomide on subject-reported fatigue as assessed by the 
Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and the safety and tolerability of teriflunomide by means of adverse event 
reporting, physical examinations, vital signs and laboratory evaluations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the annualized relapse rate, defined as the number of 
confirmed relapses per patient-year. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was time to disability progression, defined as the time to at least 
1 point increase on EDSS score from baseline, if the baseline EDSS score was ≤5.5, or time to at least 
0.5 increase on EDSS score from baseline, if the baseline EDSS score was >5.5; this increase in EDSS 
score was to be persistent for at least 12 weeks. 
Other secondary efficacy variables included the proportion of patients free of disability progression at 6 
months,  1  year  and  2  years,  estimated  by  Kaplan-Maier  curves,  FIS  total  score  and  domain  scores, 
burden  of  disease  (key  MRI  secondary  variable),  total  number  of  Gd-enhancing  T1-lesions  per  MRI 
scan  over  the  treatment  period,  total  volume  of  Gd-enhancing  T1-lesions  per  MRI  scan  over  the 
treatment  period,  volume  of  hypointense  post-Gd  T1  lesions  (black  holes),  volume  of  T2  lesion 
component and a number of exploratory MRI variables.

Sample size 
The sample size estimation was based on the primary (ARR) and key secondary efficacy comparisons. 
From  the  available  data  on  the  approval  of  interferon  beta  products,  it  was  assumed  that  the  2-year 
relapse rates were 2.20 and 1.66 for the placebo and teriflunomide groups, respectively. From recently 
available  data  on  Tysabri  trials,  the  placebo  2-year  relapse  rate  was  estimated  to  be  1.48.  Assuming 
the  number  of  relapses  follows  approximately  a  Poisson  distribution  with  a  common  SD  of  1.252,  a 
study with 360 randomized subjects per treatment arm, or a total of 1080 randomized subjects, could 
have  ≥95%  power  to  detect  a  25%  relative  risk  reduction  in  the  2-year  relapse  rate  at  the  2-tailed 
significance level  of  α = 0.050.  This  calculation incorporated  a  potential  20%  2-year  dropout  rate.  In 
addition, a study with a sample size of 360 subjects per treatment arm would lead to an 80% powered 
log-rank test to detect a 37% hazard rate reduction of an assumed disability progression hazard rate 
of  0.1783  in  the  placebo  group  and  0.1116  in  the  teriflunomide  group  (i.e.,  30%  probability  to 
disability progression for placebo patients by the end of 2 years, 20% for teriflunomide patients). This 
calculation also incorporated a 20% 2-year dropout rate. 
Randomisation 
After  completing  a  screening  phase  of  up  to  four  weeks,  patients  were  centrally  randomized  via  an 
interactive voice response system in a 1:1:1 ratio with blocks of six. The randomization was stratified, 
based  on  centre  and  by  patient’s  EDSS  score  (≤3.5  or  >3.5)  to  ensure  the  balance  in  baseline 
disability between the 3 treatment groups.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study medication teriflunomide (7 mg and 14 mg) and placebo were supplied as identical white to 
slightly yellow film-coated biconvex tablets sealed in child-resistant blister packs. 
In addition to the standard blinding procedures, the following measures were taken to further enhance 
blinding  and  reduce  bias.  At  each  study  site,  the  study  staff  included  a  minimum  of  2  neurologists 
(treating neurologist and examining neurologist), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiologist and 
technologist,  a  clinical  coordinator  and  a  technician/staff  nurse  (qualified  to  perform  MSFC).  The  site 
personnel were blinded to study treatment and this included the treating neurologist. Central readings 
of all brain MRI and computerized tomography (CT) scan images were performed by the MRI analysis 
centre  (MRI-AC)  at  the  University  of  Texas  Health  Science  Centre  at  Houston  (USA).  The  study  sites 
were required to perform and pass a qualifying or certification scan to ensure that the data acquisition 
was consistent and adequate for the study. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT population, defined as all randomized patients who 
had at least 1 day of study medication exposure. The patients were included in the treatment group to 
which  they  were  randomized.  Analyses  of  the  safety  endpoints  were  performed  using  the  safety 
population, defined as all randomized patients exposed to study medication, regardless of the amount 
of treatment administered. The patients were included in the treatment group according to the actual 
treatment received. 
The  analyses  of  the  primary  efficacy  and  key  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  also  performed  using 
the  PP  population,  defined  as  a  subset  of  the  ITT  population  containing  patients  without  a  major 
efficacy-related protocol deviation. 
The primary analysis for the ARR (primary efficacy endpoint) was performed using a Poisson regression 
model with robust error variance to accommodate the potential over-dispersed data appropriately. The 
Assessment report

model included the total number of confirmed relapses with onset between randomization date and last 
dose  date  as  the  response  variable,  a  3-level  treatment  group  (placebo,  teriflunomide  7  mg  and 
teriflunomide  14  mg),  EDSS  strata  (baseline  EDSS  score  ≤3.5  versus  >3.5)  and  region  (Eastern 
Europe,  Western  Europe  and  Americas)  as  covariates.  To  account  for  different  treatment  durations 
among patients, the log-transformed standardized treatment duration was included in the model as an 
“offset”  variable  for  appropriate  computation  of  relapse  rate.  The  robust  error  variances  were 
estimated  by  specifying  the  patient  identifier  in  the  repeated  statement  using  SAS  PROC  GENMOD, 
which  is  equivalent  to  the  Generalized  Estimating  Equation  (GEE)  model.  Two-sided  95%  confidence 
intervals  (CI)  of  the  rate  ratio  were  calculated  for  the  comparisons  of  each  active  treatment  versus 
placebo.  The  estimated  relapse  rates  and  2-sided  95%  CI  and  the  gross  estimates  of  ARR  were 
generated for each treatment group. 
The key secondary analysis for the time to disability progression (sustained for at least 12 weeks) was 
performed  using  the  log-rank  test  with  time  to  disability  progression  as  the  dependent  variable,  the 
treatment group as test variable and region and baseline EDSS strata as stratification factors. Hazard 
ratios  were  estimated  using  Cox  regression  model  with  treatment  group,  region  and  baseline  EDSS 
strata as covariates. 
The Kaplan-Meier graphs were generated and Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the disability 
progression rate and its 95% Cl at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years for each treatment group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Results of the primary analysis, i.e. analysis of the MS relapse in the ITT population are presented in 
table 9 below. 
Table 9 Analysis of MS relapse 
Results of the primary analysis in the ITT population were confirmed by secondary analyses in the PP 
population  and  the  sensitivity  analysis  of  MS  relapse  in  the  ITT  population.  In  the  PP  population,  the 
adjusted  ARR  was  0.545  (95%  CI:  0.471  to  0.631)  in  the  placebo  group,  0.367  (95%  CI:  0.314  to 
0.428)  in  the  teriflunomide  7  mg  group  and  0.366  (95%  CI:  0.305  to  0.438)  in  the  teriflunomide  14

mg  group.  Both  active  treatment  arms  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  the  primary 
endpoint  ARR  when  compared  to  placebo  (p=0.0001  for  teriflunomide  7  mg  and  p=0.0002  for 
teriflunomide  14  mg).  In  the  sensitivity  analysis  with  additional  data  collected  during  the  follow-up 
period, the adjusted ARR was 0.505 (95% CI: 0.438 to 0.583) in the placebo group, 0.358 (95% CI: 
0.308  to  0.416)  in  the  teriflunomide  7  mg  group,  and  0.358  (95%  CI:  0.300  to  0.427)  in  the 
teriflunomide 14 mg group. Both active treatment arms showed a statistically significant improvement 
in  the  primary  endpoint  ARR  when  compared  to  placebo  (p=0.0006  for  teriflunomide  7  mg  and 
p=0.0012 for teriflunomide 14 mg). 
Analysis of the key secondary endpoint, i.e. time to disability progression sustained for 12 weeks (ITT 
population) is presented in table 10. 
Table 10 Time to disability progression sustained for 12 weeks 
Neither of the teriflunomide treatment arms reached statistical significance when compared to placebo 
for  the  endpoint  time  to  disability  progression  sustained  for  24  weeks  (p=0.1459,  p=0.1259)  as 
presented  in  table  11.  Although  the  comparison  of  teriflunomide  vs  placebo  did  not  reach  statistical 
significance,  a  similar  trend  as  for  12  weeks  sustained  disability  progression  was  observed,  with  a 
slightly increased HR.

No  difference  in  effect  was  demonstrated  on  the  patient  reported  outcomes  –  FIS  and  MSFC  or  on 
quality of life variables SF-36 and EQ-5D between teriflunomide and placebo.  
The  overall  MRI  findings  supported  the  primary  results  of  both  teriflunomide  dose  groups.  Both 
teriflunomide doses improved several MRI parameters of disease activity, with a greater improvement 
observed for the 14 mg dose, as presented in table 12. Change from baseline in BOD at Week 108 was 
lower in both 7 mg and 14 mg teriflunomide groups compared with placebo (p=0.0317 and p=0.0003, 
respectively). Patients in both teriflunomide groups had fewer Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per scan than 
those in the placebo group (p<0.0001 for both doses). A post-hoc analysis comparing the 2 doses of 
teriflunomide  showed  that  the  14  mg  dose  showed  a  greater  improvement  than  the  7  mg  dose 
(p=0.0024). The change from baseline in T1 hypointense lesion volume was reduced by teriflunomide 
14  mg  compared  with  placebo  (p=0.0161)  while  no  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed 
between the 7 mg dose and the placebo group.

The  applicant  also  provided  results  (table  13)  for  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  high  activity  of  the 
disease, based on the following definition of high disease activity: patients with at least 2 relapses in 
past year and 1 Gd lesion at baseline.

EFC10531 (TOWER) – A multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study 
of the efficacy and safety of teriflunomide in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis  
Methods 
Study Participants  
To be eligible to participate in the study, the patients had to be between 18-55 years old, meeting the 
McDonald´s criteria (2005) for MS diagnosis, with an EDSS score of ≤5.5, exhibiting a relapsing clinical 
course  with  or  without  progression.  The  patients  had  to  have  at  least  1  relapse  in  the  12  months 
preceding  randomization,  or  at  least  2  relapses  in  the  24  months  preceding  the  randomization  visit. 
Patients  with  significantly  impaired  bone  marrow  function  or  significant  anaemia,  leukopenia  or 
thrombocytopenia,  patients  with  congenital  or  acquired  immunodeficiency,  malignancies  or  patients 
with liver or renal function impairment could not be enrolled. In addition, patients were not eligible for 
entry  into  the  study  if  they  met  any  of  the  following  criteria:  known  history  of  active  tuberculosis, 
persistent severe infection, HIV positivity, chronic pancreatitis, pregnancy and breast-feeding. Prior or 
concomitant  use  of  natalizumab,  cladribin,  mitoxantron  or  other  immunosuppressive  drugs  was  not 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 52/150 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
allowed.  Prior  use  of interferons,  cytokine  therapy, glatiramer  acetate  or  i.v. immunoglobulin  therapy 
was acceptable only if discontinued more than three months before participation in the study. 
Treatments 
One tablet of placebo, 7 mg teriflunomide or 14 mg teriflunomide was to be taken orally once daily in 
the morning for 48-152 weeks, depending on time of enrollement. The study medications were to be 
taken with or without food. A dosing interruption of less than or equal to 15 days was allowed. 
Concomitant  use  of  systemic  corticosteroids  for  the  treatment  of  MS  relapse  was  allowed  during  the 
study, if clinically necessary and according to the investigator´s judgment. The preferred standardized 
treatment was methylprednisolone sodium succinate 1 g, intravenously daily for 3 to 5 days. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of teriflunomide in comparison to placebo 
on frequency of MS relapses in patients with relapsing MS. 
The secondary objectives comprised evaluating the effect of teriflunomide in comparison to placebo on 
disability progression in patients with relapsing forms of MS, the effect of teriflunomide on fatigue and 
health-related quality of life and the safety and tolerability of teriflunomide. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the annualized relapse rate, defined as the number of 
confirmed relapses per patient-year. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was time to disability progression, defined as the time to at least 
1 point increase on EDSS score from baseline, if the baseline EDSS score was ≤5.5, or time to at least 
0.5 increase on EDSS score from baseline, if the baseline EDSS score was >5.5; this increase in EDSS 
score was to be persistent for at least 12 weeks. 
Other secondary endpoints were patient reported-fatigue assessed by the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), 
time  to  first  confirmed  relapse,  proportion  of  patients  without  relapse,  proportion  of  patients  free  of 
disability progression at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years, change from baseline in EDSS and the 36-item 
Short Form generic health survey (SF-36) scores. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  calculations  were  based  on  a  1:1:1  randomization  ratio  for  teriflunomide  14  mg, 
teriflunomide 7 mg and placebo, and the primary and key secondary efficacy variables of ARR and time 
to  (first)  sustained  disability  progression,  respectively,  with  the  assumptions  of:  placebo  ARR  of  0.74 
(based  on  recently  available  MS  data,  where  the  placebo  2-year  relapse  rate  was  estimated  to  be 
1.48); a 25% relative risk reduction in ARR, (i.e, ARR of 0.55, for teriflunomide); number of relapses 
follows  approximately  Poisson  distribution  with  over  dispersion  parameter  of  1.3  (estimated  with 
recently  available  data  on  Tysabri  trials  and  protocol  2001,  LTS6048);  a  1.5-year  recruitment  period 
with linear recruitment rate, thus the average exposure duration for ongoing patients is 1.75 years; a 
2-tailed 5% significance level and expected drop-out rate of 20%. Based on these assumptions, a total 
of 1110 patients (370 per treatment group) were needed for the study and had 94% power to detect a 
25% relative risk reduction in ARR. In addition, the study had 75% power to detect a 37% hazard ratio 
reduction in time to disability progression using log-rank test. The sample size and power estimate was 
computed using EAST 4.0 with the assumptions of a hazard rate of 0.1783 in the placebo group, and 
0.1116  in  the  teriflunomide  group  (i.e.,  30%  probability  of  disability  progression  for  placebo  patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013

by  the  end  of  2  years,  and  20%  for  teriflunomide  patients).  The  sample  size  was  also  adjusted  for  a 
20% drop out rate. 
Randomisation 
After a screening phase of up to 4 weeks and completion of all baseline procedures, the patients were 
centrally randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the 3 treatment groups. Randomization was stratified by 
site and baseline EDSS score (≤3.5 versus >3.5).

The  trial  was  conducted  in  a  double-blind  fashion,  with  all  investigational  products  identical  in 
appearance.  Similar  procedures  to  maintain  the  blind  were  implemented  as  in  the  first  placebo-
controlled trial, EFC6049/TEMSO.  
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population consisting of all randomized patients, who had at 
least  1  day  exposure  to  the  investigational  product.  Safety  analyses  were  based  on  the  safety 
population  which  included  all  patients  randomized  and  exposed  to  the  investigational  product,  as 
treated. The analyses of the primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy variables were also performed 
using  the  per-protocol  (PP)  population,  defined  as  a  subset  of  the  ITT  population  containing  patients 
without a major efficacy-related protocol deviation. 
The primary analysis for the ARR (primary efficacy endpoint) was performed using a Poisson regression 
model with robust error variance including the number of confirmed relapses with their onset between 
randomization date and last dose date as the response variable, treatment, region and EDSS strata as 
covariates.  To  account  for  different  treatment  durations  among  patients,  the  log-transformed 
standardized  treatment  duration  was  included  in  the  model  as  an  “offset”  variable  for  appropriate 
computation  of  relapse  rate.  The  robust  error  variances  were  estimated  by  specifying  the  patient 
identifier in the repeated statement using SAS PROC GENMOD, which is equivalent to the Generalized 
Estimating  Equation  (GEE)  model.  A  supportive  analysis  for  ARR  was  performed  using  negative 
binomial model with the same model specification as in the Poisson regression model above. Two-sided 
95% confidence intervals of the rate ratio as well as risk difference were provided for the comparison 
of  each  active  treatment  versus  placebo.  The  estimated  relapse  rates  and  2-sided  95%  confidence 
intervals were provided for each treatment group. 
The key secondary analysis for the time to disability progression (sustained for at least 12 weeks) was 
performed  using  log-rank  test  with  time  to  first  disability  progression  as  the  dependent  variable, 
treatment as test variable, and region and EDSS strata as strata variables.  
The  Kaplan-Meier  plots  were  generated  and  the  Kaplan-Meier  method  was  used  to  estimate  the 
probability  (95%  CI)  of  disability  progression  at  6  months,  1  year,  2  years  and  2.5  years  for  each 
treatment group.

Recruitment 
The study took place between 26 August 2008 and 17 April 2012. 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  5  amendments  to  the  protocol,  the  most  crucial  one  being  amendment  4,  which  among 
others, changed the timepoint for confirmation of disability progression from 24 weeks to 12 weeks to 
align the analysis with the TEMSO study.

Neither of the teriflunomide treatment arms reached statistical significance when compared to placebo 
for  the  endpoint  time  to  disability  progression  sustained  for  24  weeks  (p=0.8218,  p=0.4456)  as

Table 21 Time to disability progression sustained for 24 weeks 
With  respect  to  time  to  first  multiple  sclerosis  relapse,  the  estimated  proportion  of  patients  free  of 
confirmed  relapses  at  Week  48  was  60.6%  in  the  placebo  group,  71.9%  in  the  teriflunomide  7  mg 
group, and 76.3% in the teriflunomide 14 mg group. The statistically significant hazard reduction was 
30.2% (p=0.0016) for the teriflunomide 7 mg group and 36.9% (p<0.0001) for the teriflunomide 14 
mg group. 
The  changes  from  baseline  in  EDSS  score  for  the  ITT  population  were  analysed  and  a  statistically 
significant treatment difference was observed for the 14 mg teriflunomide dose at Week 48 (LS mean 
difference from placebo (SE) = -0.139 (0.069); 95% CI: -0.274 to -0.004; p=0.0429). These results 
were consistent with the analyses in the PP population. 
Analysis of the change from baseline values in FIS total score showed that data numerically favoured 
the  teriflunomide  dose  groups  compared  with  placebo.  Based  on  ANCOVA  analysis  of  FIS  total  score, 
the  treatment  difference  was  statistically  significant  at  a  nominal  0.05  level  (without  multiplicity 
adjustment) in the 14 mg dose group versus placebo (p=0.0429). 
Analysis  of  SF-36  of  both  physical  and  mental  components  using  the  MMRM  analysis  showed  a  trend 
for  effect  in  favour  of  14  mg  teriflunomide  versus  placebo.  Based  on  ANCOVA  analysis,  the  SF-36 
mental health summary score showed a statistically significant treatment difference at a nominal 0.05 
level (without multiplicity adjustment) in change from baseline to last visit in the 14 mg teriflunomide 
group (p=0.0224).

EFC10891  (TENERE)  -  A  multi-center,  randomized,  parallel-group,  rater-blinded  study 
comparing  the  effectiveness  and  safety  of  teriflunomide  and  interferon  beta-1a  in  patients 
with relapsing multiple sclerosis  
Methods 
Study Participants  
To  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  study,  the  patients  had  to  be  over  18  years  old,  meeting  the 
McDonald´s criteria (2005) for MS diagnosis, with an EDSS score of ≤5.5 at the time of the  screening 
visit.  The  exclusion  criteria  were  generally  in  line  with  those  established  within  the  two  placebo-
controlled trials.

Treatments 
Fig. 9 
Patients  allocated  to  teriflunomide  were  administered  either  one  tablet  7  mg  teriflunomide  or  14  mg 
teriflunomide, which was to be taken orally once daily in the morning for a minimum of 48 weeks. The 
study medications were to be taken with or without food. Patients randomised to the active comparator 
were  administered  interferon-beta  1a  in  subcutaneous  injections  three  times  a  week.  Patients  began 
the  study  with  ascending  doses  of  Rebif  8.8  mcg  for  the  first  2  weeks,  22  mcg  for  the  next  2  weeks 
and then 44 mcg. If a patient did not tolerate the 44 mcg dose, reduction back to the 22 mcg dose was 
permitted. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  two  doses  of  teriflunomide  in 
comparison to interferon-beta 1a, evaluated by the time to failure. 
The  secondary  objectives  comprised  evaluating  the  effect  of  the  two  doses  of  teriflunomide  in 
comparison  to  interferon-beta  1a  on  frequency  of  relapses,  fatigue,  patient’s  satisfaction  with 
treatment and safety and tolerability. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary  efficacy endpoint of this study was the time to failure, defined as the first occurrence of 
confirmed  relapse  or  permanent  study  treatment  discontinuation  for  any  cause,  whichever  occurred 
first.  
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  the  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR),  Fatigue  Impact  Scale 
(FIS) and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM). 
Sample size 
The sample size estimation was based on the comparison between teriflunomide and interferon beta 1a 
with regard to the primary endpoint: time to failure. With 100 randomized patients per arm, the study 
had 81% power to detect a difference between teriflunomide and interferon-beta 1a in time to failure 
at the 2-tailed significance level of α=0.025, assuming that the hazard rate was 0.4186 and 0.7440 for 
teriflunomide  and 
interferon-beta  1a,  respectively,  and  that  the  recruitment  duration  was 
approximately 1.5 years. The significance level was specified for the multiplicity consideration.

Randomisation 
Patients  were  centrally  randomized  via  an  interactive  voice  response  system  in  a  1:1:1  ratio.  The 
randomization was stratified, based on geographical region and by patient’s baseline EDSS score (≤3.5 
or >3.5). 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was double-blind with respect to the two oral treatment groups and was open-label between 
the oral treatment groups and the injection group.  
For  proper  evaluation  of  the  efficacy  endpoints  during  the  core  period  of  the  study,  there  were  two 
neurologists  at  each  study  centre.  The  treating  neurologist  was  responsible  for  subject  eligibility 
evaluation,  supervision  of  study  medication  administration,  recording  and  treating  of  AEs  and 
assessing  relapses,  and  monitoring  of  safety  assessments,  including  routine  laboratory  results  and 
concomitant  medications.  The  examining  neurologist  was  responsible  for  conducting  all  functional 
system score and EDSS score assessments. Throughout the study, the examining neurologist remained 
unaware  of  the  patient’s  treatment  assignment  and  the  safety  profile  (AEs,  concomitant  medications 
and  laboratory  results).  When  evaluating  a  patient,  the  patient  was  instructed  to  properly  dress  to 
cover any injection site locations.  
Statistical methods 
All efficacy analyses were performed using all randomized patients (ITT population). Analyses of safety 
end points were performed using the all treated population, which included patients that took at least 1 
dose of study medication. 
The primary analysis for the time to failure was performed using the log-rank test with time to failure 
as the dependent variable, treatment group (teriflunomide 7 mg, teriflunomide 14 mg and interferon-
beta  1a)  as  test  variable,  and  pre-defined  geographical  region  and  baseline  EDSS  (EDSS  score  ≤3.5 
versus  >3.5)  as  stratum  variables.  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  and  curves  of  the  cumulative  incidence 
were used to estimate the rate of failure patients across time points.

Table  24  MS  medications  taken  within  2  years  prior  to  randomization  –  number  of  patients  by 
standardized medication name (randomized population) 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 324 patients were randomized in this study (table 25). Three patients in the Rebif treatment 
group  were  randomized,  but  were  not  treated  with  study  medication  and  were  excluded  from  the 
safety population. 
Table 25 Summary of analysis populations 
Outcomes and estimation 
Results  of  the  primary  analysis,  i.e.  analysis  of  the  time  to  failure  (confirmed  relapse  or  permanent 
study treatment discontinuation) in the ITT population are presented in table 26.

The total number of confirmed MS relapses between the date of randomisation and the last dose were 
58,  35  and  25  relapses  corresponding  to  an  unadjusted  ARR  of  0.426,  0.265  and  0.223  per  patient-
year in the 7 mg teriflunomide, 14 mg teriflunomide and Rebif group, respectively. Most of the patients 
across  the  treatment  groups  experienced  no  relapse  (teriflunomide  7  mg:  63  (57.8%),  teriflunomide 
14 mg 85 (76.6%), Rebif 88 (84.6%)).  
With respect to a reported impact on fatigue, only patients in the teriflunomide 7 mg treatment group 
benefited  in  comparison  to  Rebif.  According  to  TSQM  score  measurement,  the  patients  expressed 
greater satisfaction with treatment in the teriflunomide groups than in the Rebif group: LS-mean global 
satisfaction score at Week 48 (higher score indicating better satisfaction) of 68.292 (p=0.0239 versus 
Rebif),  68.818  (p=0.0162  versus  Rebif),  and  60.975  for  7  mg,  14  mg  and  Rebif,  respectively.  This 
global  satisfaction  was  related  to  a  better  satisfaction  on  each  of  the  dimensions  used  in  that 
instrument (effectiveness, side effect and convenience).

Analysis description  Primary Analysis The primary analysis for the ARR (primary efficacy 
endpoint) was performed using a Poisson regression model with robust error 
variance to accommodate the potential over-dispersed data appropriately. 
The model included the total number of confirmed relapses with onset 
between randomization date and last dose date as the response variable, a 
3-level treatment group, EDSS strata and region as covariates. To account 
for different treatment durations among patients, the log-transformed 
standardized treatment duration was included in the model as an “offset” 
variable for appropriate computation of relapse rate.  
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the rate ratio were calculated 
for the comparisons of each active treatment versus placebo. The estimated 
relapse rates and 2-sided 95% CI and the gross estimates of ARR were 
generated for each treatment group.

The Applicant performed an integrated analysis of the EFC6049/TEMSO and EFC10531/TOWER studies. 
Exclusion  of  the  TENERE  study  from  this  analysis  was  motivated  by  the  different  design  (lack  of 
placebo arm, lack of complete blinding and a different primary endpoint).

The  assessment  of  MRI  outcome  parameters  was  not  part  of  the  TOWER  trial  and  therefore,  an 
integrated analysis on the MRI outcomes was not possible.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
No specific studies in special populations were performed. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
The  CHMP  considered  that  formally,  no  adequate  dose-finding  studies  in  the  indication  of  relapsing-
remitting  MS  were  performed  and  that  the  choice  of  doses  for  the  clinical  programme  was  based  on 
pre-clinical  data  and  comparisons  with  leflunomide  (parent  compound),  which  is  indicated  in  the 
treatment  of  rheumatoid  arthritis.  In  this  context,  the  CHMP  requested  that  the  rationale  for  the 
presumption  of  a  1:1  transmission  off  effective  doses  across  indications  should  be  provided.  The 
applicant argued that both diseases, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, are conditions with an 
inflammatory  component  and  that  the  effect  of  teriflunomide  on  the  DHO-DH  enzyme  would  lead  to 
efficacy. The CHMP acknowledged that DHO-DH inhibition results in beneficial immunosuppressive and 
consequently anti-proliferative effects in the disease, but was of the view that further arguments as to 
why comparable dosing is expected to have the minimal and the optimal effect in both diseases would 
have  been  of  additional  value,  such  as  detailed  discussion  with  respect  to  the  patho-mechanisms  of 
both diseases. However, the CHMP also considered that both the 7 and 14 mg doses were observed to 
be effective in MS on the chosen primary endpoint ARR, with a trend showing slightly improved efficacy 
with  the  14  mg  dose.  In  view  of  an  additional  trend  of  increase  incidence  of  some  adverse  events  in 
the  14  mg  dose  compared  to  the  7  mg  dose,  the  CHMP  concluded  that,  overall,  the  range  of  doses 
tested in the clinical programme of teriflunomide for RRMS was considered justified.

The main clinical studies were performed as multicentre, randomised and placebo- or active-controlled. 
Studies 2001, TEMSO and TOWER were conducted in a double blind fashion, while in the TENERE study 
with  Rebif  as  comparator,  the  treatment  was  double-blind  only  with  respect  to  the  two  teriflunomide 
groups  (7  mg  vs  14  mg)  and  open  label  for  teriflunomide  vs  Rebif.  The  CHMP  considered  the 
differences  in  the  route  of  administration  and  the  dosing  regimen  of  teriflunomide  (p.o.,  daily)  and 
Rebif  (s.c.,  three  times  a  week)  and,  taking  into  account  additional  measures  to  maintain  the  blind 
(blinded  examining  physician  different  from  the  treating  physician;  patients  instructed  to  cover 
injection  sites),  agreed  that  the  incomplete  blinding  of  the  study  was  acceptable.  The  choice  of  the 
comparator  product  Rebif,  approved  for  treatment  of  patients  with  relapsing  forms  of  MS  in  Europe 
since 1998, was considered appropriate. However, the CHMP pointed out that a formal scientific advice 
on the development of teriflunomide as monotherapy of multiple sclerosis, recommending a 3-arm trial 
comparing efficacy and safety of the test drug with placebo and comparator, was not followed by the 
applicant. 
The efficacy endpoints were chosen in accordance with the current EMA guideline for multiple sclerosis. 
The  primary  endpoint  in  the  two  phase  III  pivotal  trials  was  the  annualized  relapse  rate  and  time  to 
disability progression was chosen as the key secondary endpoint. This was considered appropriate by 
the  CHMP.  Disability  progression  was  measured  in  terms  of  time  to  a  3-month  sustained  change  in 
EDSS score of at least 1 point increase on EDSS score from baseline (if the baseline EDSS score was 
≤5.5)  or  at  least  0.5  point  increase  on  EDSS  score  from  baseline  (if  the  baseline  EDSS  score  was 
>5.5).  The  CHMP  pointed  out  that  according  to  the  Guideline  on  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal 
Products  for  the  Treatment  of  Multiple  Sclerosis  (CPMP/EWP/561/98  Rev.1).,  “accurate  and  reliable 
definition of sustained worsening is important and should include two consecutive examinations carried 
out  by  the  same  physician  at  least  6  months  apart”,  but  acknowledged  that  the  6-month  sustained 
disability progression was chosen as an additional secondary endpoint. 
The  inclusion  criteria  for  participation  in  the  study  were  considered  adequate  to  reflect  the  intended 
target population, i.e. patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The 2001 (for TEMSO) and 2005 (for 
TOWER)  McDonald  criteria  to  define  the  established  MS  were  considered  standard  criteria  and 
endorsed. The approach to include also patients with a very low EDSS score was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP, as the initiation of a disease-modifying therapy early in the disease is supported.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  the  proof-of-concept  phase  II  study  2001,  an  effect  on  the  lesions  detected  with  MRI  was  seen, 
which  was  considered  sufficient  to  proceed  with  phase  III  studies.  Demonstrating  a  convincing  effect 
on relapse rate could not be expected in this study due to its short duration and a small sample size, 
but a positive trend with respect to relapses as well as disability was observed. 
Efficacy  of  teriflunomide  was  supported  by  results  of  two  placebo  controlled  studies  (TEMSO  and 
TOWER) on the ARR and time to 3-month sustained disability progression.  
TEMSO  was  the  first  phase  III  trial  performed  with  two  doses  of  teriflunomide  in  relapsing  forms  of 
multiple sclerosis and in general, its results indicated significant reduction in the frequency of relapse 
in  both  doses  tested  (teriflunomide  7  mg  and  teriflunomide  14  mg)  as  compared  to  placebo.  The 
relative effect size observed, i.e. a 30% reduction in ARR was comparable to the effect-size seen with 
beta  interferons  and  glatiramer.  The  results  also  showed  a  statistically  significant  effect  in  time  to  3-
month  sustained  disability  progression  for  the  14  mg  dose.  Although  none  of  the  teriflunomide 
treatment  arms  reached  statistical  significance  in  comparison  to  placebo  for  the  time  to  6-month 
sustained  disability  progression,  a  similar  trend  was  observed  as  for  the  3-month  sustained  disability 
Assessment report

progression, with a slightly increased hazard ratio. Overall, the efficacy of the 14 mg dose applied for 
was considered to be higher than the 7 mg dose tested in parallel. 
The  results  were  supported  by  a  second  pivotal  trial  (TOWER).  Furthermore,  results  from  the 
integrated analysis of both trials indicated consistency in the efficacy data, based on the ARR and time 
to  sustained  disability  progression.  The  assessment  of  MRI  outcome  parameters  was  not  part  of  the 
TOWER trial and thus, an integrated analysis on the MRI outcomes was not possible. 
With the TENERE study, the applicant aimed to show superiority of teriflunomide over interferon-beta 
1a (Rebif). However, this trial did not show statistically significant differences on the primary endpoint. 
No  non-inferiority  comparison  vs  Rebif  was  planned.  In  the  TENERE  study,  the  primary  endpoint 
treatment  failure  included  both  relapse  and  treatment  discontinuation.  For  this  study,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  it  was  important  to  examine  separately  the  two  components  of  treatment  failure. 
Furthermore, it was important to demonstrate that there was no difference in the distribution of study 
duration  in  the  different  treatment  arms,  as  otherwise  the  interpretation  of  main  results  would  be 
difficult e.g. if withdrawals due to AE were early, there would not be much time to be at risk of relapse. 
These analyses were requested as they were considered to provide further supportive data for efficacy: 
The  results  of  the  separate  outcomes,  discontinuation  and  confirmed  relapse,  indicated  that  more 
patients  in  the  Rebif  treated  group  compared  to  the  teriflunomide  treated  groups  were  considered 
treatment  failure  due  to  discontinuation,  while  more  patients  in  the  teriflunomide  treated  groups  had 
relapses  compared  to  patients  treated  with  Rebif.  This  could  suggest  that  Rebif  is  more  effective  in 
preventing relapses in those patients who are able to remain on treatment, while teriflunomide seemed 
to  be  better  tolerated.  However,  this  conclusion  might  be  confounded  by  differences  in  exposure 
duration  between  treatment  conditions.  Therefore,  additional  analyses  were  requested  to  take  this 
possibility  into  account.  The  additional  data  provided  by  the  company  suggested  that  duration  of 
exposure  was  indeed  longer  in  the  teriflunomide  treatment  groups  compared  to  the  Rebif  treatment 
group, probably due to the fact that  discontinuations in the Rebif treated group occurred  earlier than 
the  relapses  in  the  teriflunomide  treated  groups.  However,  imputation  of  the  missing  data  for  non-
completers suggested that even if duration of exposure to the medications were equal, this would not 
alter the results of the primary analysis. 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  the  endpoints  time  to  failure  and  MS  relapse.  With  regard  to 
relapses, all subgroups provided better results in favour of Rebif. 
With respect to the MS type of patients enrolled in the studies, the CHMP considered that the majority 
of  patients  in  the  study  programme  were  patients  with  RRMS  and  the  number  of  patients  with 
secondary progressive MS and superimposed relapses was very limited. Therefore, further justification 
that  efficacy  could  be  reasonably  extrapolated  from  the  RRMS  to  the  broader  population  presenting 
with RMS was requested, based on mechanistic considerations and available literature. 
The  applicant  claimed  that  differences  between  progressive  forms  of  MS  and  RRMS  would  be  more 
attributable  to  different  degrees  of  inflammation,  demyelination  and  axonal  loss  than  to  qualitative 
differences. However, referring to Kappos (Effect of drug in secondary disease progression in patients 
with multiple sclerosis; Kappos L, Multiple Sclerosis 2004; 10: 46-55), the CHMP considered that “it is 
particularly  important  to  differentiate  these  two  forms  (SPMS  and  RRMS)  of  the  disease”.  As  the 
process in SPMS relates more to a cellular/axon loss than to simple inflammation, the CHMP was of the 
view that a pathophysiological difference between RRMS and SPMS cannot be neglected and therefore, 
with  respect  to  mechanistic  considerations,  the  applicant´s  argumentation  was  less  convincing. 
Overall, the CHMP felt that extrapolation of efficacy data from RRMS patients to patients with RMS was 
not supported by the information provided.

Page 86/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, when judging whether efficacy could be sufficiently ensured in the broad indication in RMS, 
the  CHMP  took  into  account  also  results  from  the  two  phase  III  studies,  TEMSO  and  TOWER.  Pre-
planned  subgroup  analyses  for  patients  with  SPMS  and  PRMS  were  presented  by  the  applicant  and 
discussed by the CHMP. In their evaluation, the CHMP considered that for the purpose of extrapolation 
to  the  still  relapsing  patients  with  SPMS  and  PRMS,  results  on  annualised  relapse  rate  were  more 
important than those on disability progression. Based on the TEMSO study, results on the SPMS+PRMS 
subgroup  did  not  indicate  that  teriflunomide  14  mg  would  be  favoured  over  placebo  (Relative  risk: 
0.985; (0.447, 2.172). Similar observation was made in the TOWER study (Relative risk: 0.963 (0.382, 
2.432).  Results  based  on  the  pooled  analyses  of  studies  TEMSO  and  TOWER  were  even  less  re-
assuring, as they favoured placebo over teriflunomide for the relapse rate (Relative risk: 1.086 (0.531, 
2.221). The CHMP considered that a more positive trend was seen with the 7 mg dose, but taking into 
account that, in the overall population, the efficacy was considered to be better for the 14 mg dose on 
both  the  MS  relapse  rate  and  disability  progression  parameters,  these  findings  were  not  considered 
sufficient to support efficacy in the SPMS+PRMS subgroup. Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the 
above  provided  subgroup  analyses,  together  with  the  lack  of  support  by  the  mechanistic 
considerations, did not allow to conclude that efficacy could be reasonably extrapolated from the RRMS 
to the broader population presenting with RMS. 
In order to identify and substantiate patient population which would benefit most from treatment with 
teriflunomide, the applicant provided a number of subgroup analyses based on baseline characteristics, 
such as disease severity and disease activity. An effect on relapse rate and disability progression (time 
to  3-month  sustained  disability  progression)  was  sufficiently  shown  across  a  number  of  treatment 
groups of patients, including patients with high disease activity.  
With respect to the definition of high disease activity “patients with at least 2 relapses in past year and 
1 Gd lesion at baseline” used by the applicant, the CHMP considered that it is analogous to the second 
part of the indication for Tysabri and Gilenya, and although a general consensus over the definition of 
high  disease  activity  is  currently  lacking,  this  approach  was  accepted.  The  point  estimate  for  the 
hazard ratio for time to disability progression was 0.648 for the teriflunomide 14 mg treatment group 
in  comparison  to  placebo,  and  for  the  annualized  relapse  rate,  results  also  pointed  into  the  right 
direction.  Reference to treatment effects in this subgroup was considered essential to the prescribing 
physician and was thus included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The CHMP considered that no data were 
available in patients  who  have  failed to  respond  to  a  full  and adequate  course  (normally  at  least  one 
year  of  treatment)  of  beta-interferon,  having  had  at  least  1  relapse  in  the  previous  year  while  on 
therapy,  and  at  least  9  T2-hyperintense  lesions  in  cranial  MRI  or  at  least  1  Gd-enhancing  lesion,  or 
patients having an unchanged or increased relapse rate in the prior year as compared to the previous 
2 years. This was reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP considered that no subgroup was identified, where the effect would be more robust or more 
convincing compared to others.  
Additional expert consultation 
In the course of the procedure, the CHMP identified need for input from the SAG Neurology on the two 
following questions: 
•  Question 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 87/150 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
How does the SAG Neurology view the efficacy of teriflunomide compared to placebo and to 
other MS products? Does the SAG consider that a beneficial effect on progression of 
disability has been clearly established? 
• 
 Question 2 
Considering the efficacy and safety profiles of teriflunomide in the context of other 
products, what are the views of the SAG Neurology on the patient population(s) in whom 
treatment with teriflunomide is likely to be most beneficial and appropriate (taking into 
account stage / duration of illness, baseline disability/ disease activity, rate of disability 
progression, response to other treatments etc.)? 
Overall, the SAG Neurology considered that the efficacy over placebo on disease activity (relapse and 
MRI parameters) was demonstrated. However, there was no consensus in the panel over the effect on 
disability  progression,  in  particular  as  both  studies  failed  on  the  time  to  6  month  sustained  disability 
secondary endpoint. Although there is no rigorous way of making comparisons across products based 
on the available data, the SAG Neurology felt that the efficacy of teriflunomide was at best comparable 
to interferon beta, as illustrated by the results of the TENERE study. 
The SAG Neurology was concerned about the safety profile of teriflunomide, in particular with respect 
to  decrease  in  lymphocyte  counts,  elevation  of  liver  enzymes,  peripheral  neuropathy,  effect  on 
pregnancy/fertility;  and  to  what  extent  these  risks  could  be  sufficiently  monitored  and  managed  in 
clinical practise. As a result, there was no consensus in the panel as to whether there is a population in 
whom teriflunomide would have a favourable benefit/risk balance.  
The  SAG  Neurology  considered  that  sub-group  analyses  did  not  point  toward  a  particular  group  of 
patients  where  the  product  would  be  most  efficacious.  However,  in  view  of  the  mild  efficacy  and  the 
safety  concerns,  the  panel  considered  that  teriflunomide  should  preferably  be  used  only  in  patients 
with mildly active RRMS.  
A majority of members also felt that the use of teriflunomide should be reserved to patients who are 
intolerant to current 1st line therapy. A minority of members disagreed with this, considering that the 
risks were  manageable  with  appropriate  risk  minimisation  measures  taking  account  of  the knowledge 
gained with leflunomide (Arava).  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall,  the  clinical  efficacy  data  submitted  were  considered  satisfactory  and  supportive  of  the 
indication  of  teriflunomide  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety database for teriflunomide as monotherapy in patients with relapsing MS included data from 
two completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (2001 and EFC6049/TEMSO), two 
ongoing  long-term  safety  studies  (LTS6048  and  LTS6050)  and  one  completed  randomized,  active-
controlled  study  (EFC10891/TENERE).  The  core  placebo-controlled  analysis  was  based  on  the 
completed  studies  in  Pool  A,  focused  on  the  placebo-controlled  segments  of  studies    2001  and 
EFC6049/TEMSO  including  844  patients  with  relapsing  MS  treated  with  teriflunomide  7  mg  (429 
patients) per day or 14 mg (415 patients) per day over a treatment period of up to 2 years. A similar

number  of  patients  were  exposed  to  placebo  (421).  The  median  treatment  exposure  was  755  days 
across treatment groups.  
The clinical development programme of teriflunomide included a total of 29 clinical studies (18 clinical 
pharmacology studies and 11 Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies). As of 8 September 2011, 23 studies were 
completed and 5 were ongoing.  
The  active-treatment  analysis  (Pool  B)  included  patients  exposed  to  teriflunomide  based  on  Phase  2 
and 3 studies and their extensions; this was a subset of 1355 patients treated with teriflunomide 7 mg 
and  14  mg,  including  the  844  patients  on  active  treatment  from  Pool  A,  with  exposure  of  up  to  10.4 
years. The median duration of study treatment was 2.7 years for each treatment group. In Pool B, the 
baseline  demographic  characteristics  were  homogenous  between  teriflunomide  7  mg  and  14  mg  and 
were overall similar to those of Pool A. Pool B provided safety information over a prolonged treatment 
period, including a subset of patients with about 10 years of follow-up. 
Patients  exposed  to  the  study  medication  were  predominantly  female  (72.3%),  primarily  Caucasian 
(96.9%) and with a median age of 39 years. The geographic regions included in Pool A were America 
(mainly,  North  America  [27.6%]),  Eastern  Europe  (26.7%)  and  Western  Europe  (41.3%),  all  being 
equally represented across the treatment groups.  
291  additional  placebo  patients  were  switched  to  active  treatment  in  the  extension  studies  and  220 
patients  were  treated  with  teriflunomide  in  study  EFC10891/TENERE  with  more  than  10  years  follow-
up.  
Additionally,  blinded  data  from  studies  ongoing  at  the  time  of  the  MAA  submission,  i.e.  study 
EFC10531/TOWER  (1165  patients  randomized  and  treated,  results  available  during  the  course  of  the 
procedure),  study  EFC6260/TOPIC  (467  patients  randomized  and  treated)  in  early  MS  (patients  with 
CIS) and study EFC6058/TERACLES (68 patients randomized and treated) in patients with stable doses 
of  IFN-β  1-a  were  also  part  of  the  safety  analysis.  Further  data  on  158  patients  from  the  1-year 
adjunct  studies  (75  patients 
that 
received 
teriflunomide 
in  addition 
to 
IFN-β  [Studies 
PDY6045+LTS6047]  and  83  patients  in  addition  to  GA  [Studies  PDY6046+LTS6047])  were  presented 
separately.  The  median  duration  of  study  treatment  was  similar  (336  to  337  days)  in  all  treatment 
groups for studies PDY6045+LTS6047 and PDY6046+LTS6047. 
The  safety  database  for  teriflunomide  included  over  4394  cumulative  patient-years  of  exposure 
(2294.68  patient-years  for  the  7  mg  teriflunomide  group  and  2099.75  patient-years  for  the  14  mg 
teriflunomide group) including 77 patients who received the compound for at least 8 years.  
Adverse events 
The  most  frequently  reported  treatment–emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  (with  PT  ≥10%  in  any  treatment 
group)  and  with  a  significant  difference  for  teriflunomide  as  compared  to  placebo  were  alopecia,  ALT 
increased, diarrhoea and nausea. A clear dose effect was seen for these events.  
In Pool A, the proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE was similar across teriflunomide and placebo 
groups. Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 12.8% of patients in the placebo group, 12.8% of 
patients in the 7 mg teriflunomide group and 15.7% of patients in the 14 mg teriflunomide group. The 
frequency  of  serious  TEAEs  and  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  was  reported 
with a slightly higher incidence on teriflunomide 14 mg compared to the 7 mg and placebo groups. 
In Pool B, the proportion of patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE was 23.2% and 20.7% in 
the  7  mg  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were 
within the “Investigations” and “Infections and infestations” SOCs. 
Assessment report

A similar proportion of TEAEs was reported in the 7 mg and 14 mg teriflunomide groups in the single-
dose  non-placebo-controlled  phase  1  studies.  In  the  repeated-dose  studies,  where  teriflunomide  was 
administered  using  a  loading  dose  of  70  mg  for  3  to  4  days  to  obtain  rapidly  steady  state 
concentrations,  and  followed  by  a  repeated  high  dose  of  14  mg  to  maintain  the  steady  state,  the 
proportion  of  TEAEs  with  teriflunomide  (32.3%)  was  comparable  to  placebo  (33.1%).  A  higher 
frequency  of  events  was  reported  during  the  rapid  elimination  procedure  either  after  teriflunomide 
(52.0%)  or  after  placebo  (63.9%).  Relatively  few  serious  TEAEs  and  TEAEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuations were reported either in the single-dose or repeated-dose studies. 
The  overall  frequencies  of  the  most  common  and  common  TEAEs  seen  in  the  other  studies 
(EFC10891/TENERE,  PDY6045+LTS6047,  pooled  single  and  repeated  dose  studies,  study  INT10564, 
EFC10531/TOWER,  EFC6260/TOPIC,  EFC6058/TERACLES)  were  similar  to  those  seen  in  Pool  A  and 
Pool  B.  The  overall  percentage  of  patients  with  TEAEs  was  similar  in  the  teriflunomide  treatment 
groups as compared to Rebif in the TENERE study. 
In the placebo-controlled Pool A, the 5 SOCs with the most frequently reported TEAEs were as follows 
(by decreasing frequency in the 14 mg teriflunomide group):  
•  Infections  and  infestations  (57.5%,  59.7%,  61.7%  on  placebo,  teriflunomide  7  mg  and 
teriflunomide 14 mg, respectively) 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders (34.4%, 39.9%, 45.3% on placebo, teriflunomide 7 mg and teriflunomide 
14 mg, respectively) 
•  Nervous system disorders (45.4%, 45.7%, 45.1% on placebo, teriflunomide 7 mg and teriflunomide 
14 mg, respectively) 
•  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (21.9%, 28.9%, 37.1% on placebo, teriflunomide 7 mg and 
teriflunomide 14 mg, respectively) 
•  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (39.2%, 38.2%, 35.7% on placebo, teriflunomide 7 
mg and teriflunomide 14 mg, respectively) 
The incidence rate and relative risk ratio of common TEAEs (≥2% at the MedDRA HLT level in any of 
the treatment groups) based on the Pool A safety population is presented in table 32.

Among  the  common  TEAEs,  the  following  PTs  were  reported  with  higher  frequency  in  one  or  both 
teriflunomide groups, as compared to placebo with a difference of ≥1%: 
Headache,  diarrhoea,  alopecia,  nausea,  alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  influenza,  upper 
respiratory  tract  infection,  paraesthesia,  urinary  tract  infection,  arthralgia,  bronchitis,  sinusitis, 
dizziness,  rash,  neutropenia,  vomiting,  hypertension,  toothache,  musculoskeletal  pain,  pharyngitis, 
anxiety,  viral  gastroenteritis,  cystitis,  oral  herpes,  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased,  rhinitis, 
seasonal  allergy,  myalgia,  GGT  increased,  eczema,  pruritus,  acne,  sciatica,  multiple  sclerosis, 
pollakiuria, weight decreased, carpal tunnel syndrome, menorrhagia, pain, neutrophil count decreased, 
hyperaesthesia,  post-traumatic  pain,  palpitations,  tooth  infection,  tinea  pedis,  tonsillitis,  laryngitis, 
muscle  spasticity,  neuralgia,  faecal  incontinence,  flatulence,  erythema,  white  blood  cell  count 
decreased, leukopenia and abdominal distension. 
There  were  no  unexpected  findings  in  the  adverse  event  profile  in  patients  receiving  teriflunomide  in 
Pool B; the adverse events were comparable to those observed in Pool A. Within this safety population, 
the most commonly reported adverse reactions in the teriflunomide 14 mg group versus placebo were: 
influenza  (11.8%  versus  9.3%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (10.8%  versus  9.0%),  urinary  tract 
infection  (10.6%  versus  9.5%),  paraesthesia  (10.6%  versus  7.8%),  diarrhoea  (17.3%  versus  8.3%), 
ALT increased (14.0% versus 7.1%), nausea (14.2% versus 6.9%) and alopecia (14.7% versus 4.3%). 
In  general,  diarrhoea,  nausea  and  alopecia,  were  mild  to  moderate,  transient  and  infrequently  led  to 
treatment discontinuation.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were defined as events of potential risk of occurrence based 
on  the  current  available  preclinical  and  clinical  data,  the  class  effect  and  the  potential  mechanism  of 
action of teriflunomide. These AE groups are presented in table 33 together with their incidence rates 
and relative risk ratios.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the placebo-controlled Pool A, treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 12.8% of patients in the 
placebo group, 12.8% of patients in the 7 mg teriflunomide group and 15.7% of patients in the 14 mg 
teriflunomide group. There was no difference between groups in the proportion of patients with serious 
hepatic  disorders.  Serious  cholecystitis  and  cholelithiasis  were  more  frequent  in  patients  treated  with 
teriflunomide  7  mg  (1.9%)  than  in  those  treated  with  placebo  or  teriflunomide  14  mg  (0.2%  each). 
Two patients treated with teriflunomide 14 mg experienced moderate neutropenia or neutrophil count 
decrease.  Both  patients  recovered  while  continuing  treatment  with  teriflunomide.  Serious  infections 
and  infestations  were  reported  with  a  similar  frequency  in  both  the  placebo  (2.1%)  and  14  mg 
teriflunomide  (2.2%)  groups  and  with  a  slightly  lower  incidence  in  the  7  mg  teriflunomide  group 
(1.4%).  Overall,  one  case  of  pancreatitis  was  reported  in  the  placebo  group  whereas  two  patients  in 
the  7  mg  teriflunomide  group  had  serious  asymptomatic  increases  in  lipase  (up  to  5.2  x  ULN),  and 
recovered.  The  rate  of  neoplasms  (benign,  malignant  and  unspecified)  as  a  whole  was  1.0%  in  the 
placebo  group,  0.2%  in  the  7  mg  teriflunomide  group  and  0.5%  in  the  14  mg  teriflunomide  group. 
Among  them,  3  patients,  all  treated  with  placebo,  had  malignant  tumours  including  breast  cancer, 
thyroid cancer and cervical cancer (1 case each) and 1 patient treated with teriflunomide 14 mg was 
diagnosed  with  cervix  carcinoma  in  situ  (stage  0),  which  resolved  following  surgical  ablation  of  the 
tumour.  One  case  of  ongoing  depression  followed  by  a  suicide  attempt  was  reported  in  a  patient 
treated with placebo, two patients treated with teriflunomide 7 mg experienced major depression and 
1  suicide  attempt  was  reported  in  a  patient  treated  with  teriflunomide  14  mg.  Angina  pectoris  and 
myocardial infarction (1 case each) were reported in the placebo group. Both patients recovered with 
corrective  treatment.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  serious  TEAEs  in  the  “Skin  and  subcutaneous 
tissue disorders” SOC (0.2% on placebo and in each teriflunomide group), in the “Musculoskeletal and 
connective  tissue  disorders”  SOC  (1.0%  on  placebo  and  on  teriflunomide  14  mg  and  1.2%  on 
teriflunomide  7  mg)  and  in  the  “Investigations”  SOC  (3.1%  on  placebo  and  2.1%  and  2.9%  on 
teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively) was largely similar across all treatment  groups. Serious 
gastrointestinal  disorders  were  more  frequent  in  the  teriflunomide  groups  (1.9%  each)  than  in  the 
Assessment report

placebo group (0.2%). Two patients  were hospitalized, one of whom had a history of gastrointestinal 
reflux and concomitant use of NSAID therapy. Serious TEAEs in the “Renal and urinary disorders” SOC 
(renal  colic  and  urethral  stenosis)  were  reported  in  two  patients  in  the  14  mg  teriflunomide  group 
(versus no patients in the other 2 groups).  
In Pool B, the proportion of patients with at least one treatment-emergent SAE was 23.2% and 20.7% 
in  the  7  mg  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were 
from  the  SOC  “Investigations”  (4.3%  and  4.4%  in  the  7  mg  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups, 
respectively),  mainly  due  to  ALT  increased.  Serious  TEAEs  in  the  “Infections  and  infestations”  SOC 
were  reported  in  3.9%  and  3.6%  of  patients  on  teriflunomide  7  mg  and  teriflunomide  14  mg, 
respectively. 
In  study  EFC10891/TENERE,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  serious  TEAEs  was  similar  between 
teriflunomide  14  mg  and  Rebif  (5.5%  and  6.9%,  respectively),  but  higher  with  teriflunomide  7  mg 
(10.9%).  
Deaths 
No  deaths  were  reported  in  Pool  A,  adjunct  studies  or  Phase  1  studies.  In  Pool  B,  four  deaths  were 
reported  during  the  long-term  studies  in  patients  treated  with  teriflunomide  for  3  to  9  years.  In 
addition,  four  deaths  were  reported  in  the  ongoing  studies  including  2  completed  suicides,  a  road 
traffic  accident  and  a  septicemia  due  to  Gram-negative  organism  complicated  with  disseminated 
intravascular coagulopathy (in the 14 mg teriflunomide group).

The deaths reported during the overall clinical programme are summarised in figure 14.

Hepatic disorders 
ALT  elevations  less  than  3xULN  were  more  common  with  teriflunomide,  with  a  frequent  onset  during 
the  first  6 months  of  treatment  and  recovery  on-treatment  for  most  patients.  The  overview  of  TEAEs 
for  hepatic  disorders  and  ALT  increase  (based  on  laboratory  data)  based  on  the  pool  A  safety 
population is presented in table 35.

In  the  SOC  “Hepatobiliary  disorders”,  there  was  a  slight  imbalance  with  serious  cholecystitis  and 
cholelithiasis  more  frequently  reported  in  patients  treated  with  teriflunomide  7  mg  (1.9%)  than  in 
those treated with placebo or teriflunomide 14 mg (0.2% each). 
Pancreatic disorders 
In  placebo-controlled  Pool  A,  the  distribution  of  patients  with  pancreatic  disorders  TEAEs  was  similar 
across the treatment groups (3.1%,  3.3%, and 2.4% in the placebo, 7 mg teriflunomide, and 14 mg 
teriflunomide  groups,  respectively).  Median  time  to  onset  of  pancreatic  disorders  was  299  days  on 
placebo, 155 days on teriflunomide 7 mg and 71 days on teriflunomide 14 mg. One case of pancreatitis 
confirmed  by  cholangiopancreatography  was  diagnosed  in  a  patient  treated  with  placebo  in  pool  A. 
Isolated  cases  of  pancreatic  abnormalities  were  reported  in  pool  B.  The  analysis  of  laboratory  values 
showed that in Pool A, elevation of pancreatic lipase and amylase (>2 to ≤5 x ULN or >5 x ULN) was 
reported in a small number of patients in the placebo and the 7 mg teriflunomide groups. No increases 
in pancreatic lipase >2 x ULN or in pancreatic amylase >5 x ULN were reported in patients in the 14 
mg teriflunomide group. There were no mean increases compared to baseline for serum amylase and 
lipase  values.  In  EFC10531/TOWER  Phase  3  study  the  incidence  of  patients  with  pancreatic  disorders 
TEAEs  was  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  (1.3%,  1.5%,  and  1.3%  in  the  placebo,  7  mg 
teriflunomide,  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups,  respectively)  and  there  were  no  mean  increases  (as 
compared to baseline) in serum  amylase and lipase confirming the results of the first phase  3 study, 
EFC6049/ TEMSO. 
Bone marrow disorders 
In  Pool  A,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  TEAEs  for  bone  marrow  disorders  was  higher  in  both 
teriflunomide  groups  (10.3%  and  8.7%  in  the  7  mg  teriflunomide  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups, 
respectively)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (2.6%).  The  effect  of  teriflunomide  on  bone  marrow  was 
evidenced by a decrease affecting primarily WBC counts (<15% from baseline levels, mainly neutrophil 
and  lymphocyte  count  decrease)  and  a  dose  effect  was  observed.  The  decrease  in  mean  count  from 
baseline  occurred  during  the  first  6  weeks,  then  stabilised  over  time  while  on-treatment  but  at 
decreased  levels.  There  were  isolated  cases  of  more  significant  decrease,  predominantly  in  WBCs; 
most of these cases resolved rapidly and the patients continued treatment. 
Infections 
In Pool A, the proportion of patients with TEAEs related to infections and infestations was comparable 
across  the  treatment  groups.  The  analysis  of  relative  risk  did  not  show  an  increased  risk  with  either

teriflunomide 7 mg or teriflunomide 14 mg compared to placebo. A low and similar incidence of serious 
infections was reported across groups (2.1%, 1.4% and 2.2% in the placebo, 7 mg teriflunomide and 
14 mg teriflunomide groups, respectively). Infections mainly involved the upper respiratory tract. Viral 
infections  were  reported  with  a  higher  frequency  in  the  7  mg  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups 
compared  to  placebo  (4.4%,  6.5%  and  1.9%,  respectively),  with  a  trend  towards  a  dose-effect 
relationship. None of the TEAEs were considered serious or led to treatment discontinuation. 
With  respect  to  opportunistic  infections,  non-serious  herpetic  infections  were  reported  with  a  higher 
frequency  with  teriflunomide  as  compared  to  placebo.  Two  opportunistic  infections  were  reported  as 
serious  TEAE  (1  case  of  herpes  zoster  on  placebo  and  1  case  of  CMV  hepatitis  infection  on 
teriflunomide  14  mg)  in  Pool  A  and  1  reported  in  Pool  B  (1  case  of  oral  herpes  with  teriflunomide  7 
mg).  In  addition,  in  Pool  B,  1  case  of  suspected  tuberculosis  primary  infection  was  reported  on 
teriflunomide  14  mg.  No  systemic  opportunistic  infections,  such  as  pneumocystis,  toxoplasma, 
mycobacterium,  syphilis,  mucocutaneous  candidiasis,  histoplasmosis,  or  aspergillosis  were  reported. 
No cases of progressive PML were observed in the entire teriflunomide programme. Of note, one fatal 
septicaemia due to  Gram-negative organism was reported in a patient on teriflunomide 14 mg in the 
study EFC10531/TOWER. 
Hypersensitivity/skin disorders 
In  Pool  A,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  TEAEs  potentially  related  to  hypersensitivity  and  skin 
disorders was higher in the teriflunomide groups compared to placebo (14.5%, 19.1% and 20.5%, for 
the  placebo,  7  mg  teriflunomide  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups,  respectively).  Urticaria,  erythema, 
pruritus,  and  pruritic  rash  were  observed  with  low  incidences,  but  were  more  frequent  in  the 
teriflunomide  groups  compared  to  placebo  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  One  patient  in  the  7  mg 
teriflunomide  group  discontinued  due  to  intense  generalised  rash.  Two  patients  in  the  14  mg  group 
discontinued treatment, 1 due to pruritus and 1 due to urticaria. 
In  Pool  B,  six  patients  in  the  7  mg  teriflunomide  group  had  serious  TEAEs  identified  in  the  MedDRA 
search  for  potential  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Most  of  them  were  considered  related  to  underlying 
disease  conditions  and  were  not  suggestive  of  teriflunomide-related  hypersensitivity  reactions.  No 
severe  generalised  major  skin  disorders  (Stevens-Johnson  syndrome,  or  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis-
Lyell’s syndrome) were observed during the studies with teriflunomide. 
Malignancy 
In  Pool  A,  in  a  total  of  7  cases  (4  cases  on  placebo,  1  case  on  teriflunomide  7  mg  and  2  cases  on 
teriflunomide  14  mg),  most  cases  of  medically  confirmed  malignant  tumours  including  breast  cancer, 
thyroid  cancer  and  cervix  carcinoma  in  situ  (1  case  each)  were  reported  in  the  placebo  group.  One 
case of cervix carcinoma in situ was identified in a patient receiving teriflunomide 14 mg and no case 
was identified in the 7 mg teriflunomide group. All patients recovered following appropriate therapy.  
In  Pool  B,  a  total  of  22  cases  of  TEAEs  for  benign  and  malignant  neoplasm  were  identified  using  the 
specific  narrow  SMQ  search  for  malignancy:  14  (2.0%)  on  teriflunomide  7  mg  and  8  (1.2%)  on 
teriflunomide 14 mg. Among these 22 patients with benign and malignant tumours, 12 were diagnosed 
with medically confirmed malignancies (10 patients in the teriflunomide 7 mg group and 2 patients in 
the  14  mg  teriflunomide  group).  The  median  time  to  onset  was  5.2  years  and  2.95  years  for 
teriflunomide 7 mg and teriflunomide 14 mg, respectively.

Hypertension 
In  Pool  A,  an  increased  frequency  of  hypertension  was  observed  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies 
(1.9%,  3.5%  and  4.3%  on  placebo,  teriflunomide  7  mg  and  14  mg,  respectively).  New-onset 
hypertension  occurred  in  2.8%  and  3.5%  of  patients  in  the  7  mg  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups 
compared to 1.1% of patients in the placebo group. Exacerbation of pre-existing hypertension was also 
more  frequent  in  patients  treated  with  teriflunomide  compared  to  placebo  (9.5%  and  10.6%  in 
teriflunomide  7  and  14  mg  compared  to  8.9%  in  placebo).  A  tendency  to  normalization  of  blood 
pressure with the cessation of study treatment was observed in the follow-up period. 
Cardiac arrhythmias 
Electrocardiographic evaluations performed in the clinical programme, including a thorough ECG study 
(Study TES10852) did not indicate risk of cardiac rhythm abnormalities with teriflunomide exposure as 
compared to placebo. No effect on heart rate was observed and no categorical increases of QTcF >480 
ms  or  QTcF  increases  from  baseline  >60  ms  were  observed.  Isolated  events  of  cardiac  arrhythmia 
were  reported  in  teriflunomide-treated  patients;  these  were  asymptomatic  premature  cardiac 
complexes commonly seen in the general population and asymptomatic atrial fibrillation.  
Interstitial lung disease 
No risk of ILD with teriflunomide treatment became apparent in the teriflunomide clinical programme. 
No AEs potentially attributed to ILD were reported in the teriflunomide groups in Pool A. There were 2 
cases of suspected ILD in the extension studies (Pool B), which were unlikely related to teriflunomide 
treatment. 
Haemorrhages 
In  placebo-controlled  Pool  A,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  haemorrhages  was  7.4%  on  placebo, 
6.8% on teriflunomide 7 mg and 9.4% on teriflunomide 14 mg. The slightly higher percentage in the 
14 mg group was mainly related to cases of menorrhagia or metrorrhagia in the 14 mg teriflunomide 
group. Most cases were incidental or had plausible explanations such as myomas.  
Peripheral neuropathy 
In Pool A, overall TEAEs potentially related to peripheral neuropathy were reported in 4.8% of patients 
in  the  placebo  group,  3.7%  in  the  7  mg  teriflunomide  group  and  6.0%  in  the  14  mg  teriflunomide 
group.  No  significant  difference  in  the  incidence  of  peripheral  neuropathy  was  reported  across  the 
treatment groups in Pool A (0.5% on placebo, 0.5% and 0.7% on teriflunomide 7 mg and teriflunomide 
14  mg,  respectively).  Several  non-serious  cases  of  polyneuropathy  were  seen  with  teriflunomide 
treatment, while none was observed in patients on placebo.  
Alopecia 
In Pool A, the proportion of patients with TEAEs related to alopecia was higher in the two teriflunomide 
groups  compared  to  the  placebo  group,  and  a  dose-effect  relationship  was  observed  (4.3%,  11.4%, 
and 15.2% on placebo, teriflunomide 7 mg and teriflunomide 14 mg, respectively). The majority of the 
events  were  reported  in  female  patients.  Most  cases  were  of  mild  and  moderate  intensity  with 
spontaneous resolution within 4 months on treatment. No cases of complete hair loss were reported in 
the entire clinical programme. In the safety analysis of Pool B, no increased risk of alopecia with long-
term administration was observed. 
Laboratory findings 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 100/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Laboratory  data  were  reviewed  to  identify  possible  trends  resulting  from  exposure  to  teriflunomide. 
Similar  proportions  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  and  the  teriflunomide  groups  (in  Pool  A) 
experienced  abnormalities  in  metabolic  functions.  Mean  changes  from  baseline  in  values  of  metabolic 
functions  were  minimal  over  time  and  did  not  vary  between  treatment  groups.  Increase  in  CPK  >1  - 
≤2.5 ULN occurred most frequently on teriflunomide 7 mg (23.0%) compared to placebo (8.2%) and 
teriflunomide 14 mg (17.5%); however, these calculations were based on a small subset of patients in 
each treatment group.  
No  effect  of  teriflunomide  on  metabolic  functions  (e.g.  glucose  metabolism,  cholesterol  panel)  was 
observed. No change in glomerular renal function assessed by creatinine, creatinine clearance or BUN 
was observed with teriflunomide. Decrease in plasma level of total uric acid with teriflunomide resulted 
from the uricosuric effect of teriflunomide. 
Approximately 10% decrease in plasma level of inorganic phosphorus was observed with teriflunomide 
treatment, also considered to be due to increased renal tubular elimination.  
Further  laboratory  data  (liver  enzymes,  haematology  and  pancreatic  enzymes)  are  described  in  the 
section regarding adverse events of special interest. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup  safety  analyses  from  all  studies  were  provided.  The  following  subgroups  were  analysed  for 
their  effects  on  the  incidence  of  any  TEAEs,  serious  TEAEs  and  TEAEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation for patients taking 7 mg or 14 mg teriflunomide compared to placebo 
•  Age group (<38 years or ≥38 years) 
•  Gender group (Male or Female) 
•  Racial group (Caucasian, Black, Asian/Oriental, Other) 
•  BMI (<25, ≥25 to <30, ≥30 kg/m2) 
•  Baseline EDSS score (≤3.5, >3.5) 
Overall, there were no intrinsic factors that would increase the risk of experiencing any TEAEs or any 
serious TEAE for patients taking 7 mg or 14 mg teriflunomide compared to placebo. 
Patients <38 years on teriflunomide 14 mg versus placebo showed an increased risk of AEs leading to 
discontinuation  compared  to  the  patients  with  age  ≥38  years.  However,  due  to  the  small  number  of 
discontinuation for TEAE, this result may have been an accidental finding. 
Teriflunomide  was  not  specifically  investigated  in  the  elderly  and  there  was  only  one  subject  in  the 
clinical programme aged 65 who was exposed to teriflunomide.  
There  is  no  relevant  use  of  teriflunomide  in  children  aged  from  birth  to  less  than  10  years  for  the 
treatment of multiple sclerosis. The safety and efficacy of teriflunomide in children aged 10 to 18 years 
was not established at the time of the initial marketing authorisation application. 
Recommendations  for  patients  with  renal  and  hepatic  impairment  are  discussed  under  clinical 
pharmacology aspects. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Effect of teriflunomide on CYP2C8 substrate: repaglinide 
There  was  an  increase  in  mean  repaglinide  Cmax  and  AUC  (1.7-  and  2.4-fold,  respectively), 
followingrepeated  doses  of  teriflunomide,  suggesting  that  teriflunomide  is  an  inhibitor  of  CYP2C8  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 101/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
vivo.  Therefore,  medicinal  products  metabolised  by  CYP2C8,  such  as  repaglinide,  paclitaxel, 
pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, should be used with caution during treatment with teriflunomide. 
Effect of teriflunomide on oral contraceptive: 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel 
There was an increase in mean ethinylestradiol Cmax and AUC0-24 (1.58- and 1.54-fold, respectively) 
and levonorgestrel Cmax and AUC0-24 (1.33- and 1.41-fold, respectively) following repeated doses of 
teriflunomide. While this interaction of teriflunomide is not expected to adversely impact the efficacy of 
oral  contraceptives,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  type  or  dose  of  oral  contraceptives  used  in 
combination with teriflunomide. 
Effect of teriflunomide on CYP1A2 substrate: caffeine 
Repeated  doses  of  teriflunomide  decreased  mean  Cmax  and  AUC  of  caffeine  (CYP1A2  substrate)  by 
18% and 55%, respectively, suggesting that teriflunomide may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. 
Therefore, medicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2 (such as duloxetin, alosetron, theophylline and 
tizanidine)  should  be  used  with  caution  during  treatment  with  teriflunomide,  as  it  could  lead  to  the 
reduction of the efficacy of these products. 
Effect of teriflunomide on warfarin 
Repeated  doses  of  teriflunomide  had  no  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  S-warfarin,  indicating  that 
teriflunomide  is  not  an  inhibitor  or  an  inducer  of  CYP2C9.  However,  a  25%  decrease  in  peak 
international  normalised  ratio  (INR)  was  observed  when  teriflunomide  was  coadministered  with 
warfarin  as  compared  with  warfarin  alone.  Therefore,  when  warfarin  is  co-administered  with 
teriflunomide, close INR follow-up and monitoring is recommended. 
Effect of teriflunomide on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates: 
There  was  an  increase  in  mean  cefaclor  Cmax  and  AUC  (1.43-  and  1.54-fold,  respectively),  following 
repeated  doses  of  teriflunomide,  suggesting  that  teriflunomide  is  an  inhibitor  of  OAT3  in  vivo. 
Therefore,  when  teriflunomide  is  coadministered  with  substrates  of  OAT3,  such  as  cefaclor, 
benzylpenicillin,  ciprofloxacin, 
indometacin,  ketoprofen, 
furosemide,  cimetidine,  methotrexate, 
zidovudine, caution is recommended. 
Effect  of  teriflunomide  on  BCRP  and  /or  organic  anion  transporting  polypeptide  B1  and  B3 
(OATP1B1/B3) substrates: 
There  was  an  increase  in  mean  rosuvastatin  Cmax  and  AUC  (2.65-  and  2.51-fold,  respectively), 
following repeated doses  of teriflunomide. However, there was no apparent  impact of this increase in 
plasma  rosuvastatin  exposure  on  the  HMG-CoA  reductase  activity.  For  rosuvastatin,  a  dose  reduction 
by  50%  is  recommended  for  coadministration  with  teriflunomide.  For  other  substrates  of  BCRP  (e.g., 
methotrexate,  topotecan,  sulfasalazine,  daunorubicin,  doxorubicin)  and  the  OATP  family  especially 
HMG-Co  reductase  inhibitors  (e.g.,  simvastatin,  atorvastatin,  pravastatin,  methotrexate,  nateglinide, 
repaglinide,  rifampicin)  concomitant  administration  of  teriflunomide  should  also  be  undertaken  with 
caution.  Patients  should  be  closely  monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  excessive  exposure  to  the 
medicinal products and reduction of the dose of these medicinal products should be considered. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  Pool  A,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  was 
7.6%,  9.1%  and  11.8%  in  the  placebo,  7  mg  teriflunomide  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups, 
respectively. The most common TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation was ALT increased (1.9%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 102/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
2.6%,  and  1.9%  in  the  placebo,  7  mg  teriflunomide,  and  14  mg  teriflunomide  groups,  respectively). 
Per study protocols, treatment was to be discontinued for confirmed ALT increase above 3 x ULN.  
In  Pool  B,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawals  was  similar  between  the 
treatment  groups  (15.6%  and  15.3%  on  teriflunomide  7  mg  and  14  mg,  respectively),  with  reasons 
consistent with those observed in Pool A. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the clinical development programme, the cumulative exposure to teriflunomide in the monotherapy 
trials was over 4394 patient-years up to the database lock point for this submission. The inclusion of 
EFC10531/TOWER study increased the exposure to more than 6200 patient-years, with a safety profile 
considered  similar  to  the  safety  profile  established  with  the  previous  studies  and  without  any 
unexpected safety findings.  
In  the  pivotal  Phase  2  and  3  trials  included  in  Pool  A  and  Pool  B,  1355  patients  were  exposed  to 
teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg with a maximum exposure of up to 10.4 years. The median duration of 
study  treatment  was  2.7  years  for  both  teriflunomide  7  mg  and  14  mg  in  Pool  B.  In  addition,  462 
subjects  were  exposed  to  teriflunomide  in  the  Phase  1  studies  with  single  doses  up  to  100  mg  and 
repeated doses up to 70 mg/day.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  extent  and  duration  of  exposure,  in  particular  the  total  number  of  MS 
patients treated for at least 6 months at dose levels intended for clinical use, was adequate to assess 
clinical  safety  of  a  drug  intended  for  long-term  treatment  and  in  line  with  the  NfG  on  population 
exposure to assess clinical safety (CPMP/ICH/375/95). 
The demographic characteristics of the safety population were very similar for Pool A as compared to 
Pool B. The safety population was primarily Caucasian (>96%), with a median age of 38 to 39 years 
and  with  a  predominance  of  females  (>70%).  The  geographic  regions  represented  were  mainly 
Western Europe, North America and Eastern Europe. 
The  most  common  clinical  AEs  reported  with  teriflunomide  with  a  dose-effect  relationship  were 
diarrhoea, alopecia, nausea and ALT increased (less than 3x ULN). These events were generally of mild 
intensity and infrequently led to treatment discontinuation.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  safety  database  was  not  sufficient  to  entirely  exclude  a  risk  of  drug 
induced liver disorders. Hepatic toxicity is a known risk of teriflunomide, which was supported by the 
data  that  >1  -  ≤3  x  ULN  increase  in  ALT  was  observed  in  29.5%  placebo  vs.  47.7%  and  49.6% 
teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg, respectively. With the argument that the median time to onset of hepatic 
disorders  was  127  days  in  the  14  mg  teriflunomide  group,  the  applicant  initially  proposed  a  hepatic 
monitoring schedule consisting of screening at baseline, and then monthly for six months and quarterly 
thereafter  for  a  year  or  as  indicated  by  clinical  signs  and  symptoms.  The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that 
the  reversibility  of  mild  hepatic  toxicity  was  not  convincingly  demonstrated  and  moreover,  that  once 
hepatic  injury  is  detected,  it  needs  to  be  closely  monitored,  since  ALT  levels  may  further  increase  or 
decrease. As most mild elevations are asymptomatic, a quarterly monitoring after the first 6 months of 
treatment  was  not  considered  sufficient  to  ensure  timely  detection  of  hepatic  toxicity.  In  conclusion, 
the  CHMP  requested  that  liver  enzymes  should  be  assessed  every  two  weeks  during  the  first  six 
months of treatment and every eight weeks thereafter or as indicated by clinical sign and symptoms; 
this was reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. A pre-existing severe hepatic impairment was considered 
to preclude the use of teriflunomide and was therefore included as a contraindication.

Since  teriflunomide  is  highly  protein  bound  and  cleared  via  hepatic  metabolism  and  biliary  secretion, 
plasma levels of teriflunomide can be expected to be increased in patients with hypoproteinaemia. As 
patients with severe hypoproteinaemia were excluded from the pivotal studies, teriflunomide poses an 
unknown  risk  for  this  patient  group,  because  insufficient  clinical  experience  is  available.  Therefore, 
teriflunomide should not be used in patients with conditions of severe hypoproteinaemia, as reflected 
in sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Pancreas  was  identified  as  a  target  organ  in  a  12-month  toxicity  study  in  dogs;  this  finding  was  of 
uncertain relationship to the pharmacologic activity of teriflunomide in humans. In clinical studies with 
close laboratory monitoring and imaging, there was no mean increase (compared to baseline) in serum 
amylase  and  lipase.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  available  clinical  data  did  not  suggest  a  critically 
increased risk of clinical pancreatitis in patients treated with therapeutic doses of teriflunomide.  Based 
on  the  evidence  available  for  leflunomide  (parent  compound),  pancreatic  disorders  were  reflected  in 
the RMP as an important identified risk. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  bone  marrow  disorders  was  higher  in  both  teriflunomide  treatment 
groups compared to placebo. Isolated cases of significant cytopenias were observed, such as cases of 
more significant decreases of white blood cell count and thrombocytopenia.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs in Pool A were infections, with a slightly higher incidence in both 
teriflunomide  groups  compared  to  placebo.  The  most  frequently  reported  events  were  upper 
respiratory tract infections, especially nasopharyngitis. The frequency of non-serious herpetic infections 
was higher on teriflunomide as compared to placebo. The incidence of serious infections and infections 
leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  was  similar  across  all  groups.  Apart  from  sporadic  cases  of 
tuberculosis  and  cytomegalovirus  hepatitis  infection  on  teriflunomide  treatment,  no  signals  of  severe 
systemic opportunistic infections, including PML, were be detected.  
With  respect  to  the  fatal  case  of  a  gram-negative  sepsis,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the 
immunosuppressant potential of teriflunomide was possibly responsible for the fatal outcome in the 20 
year old female patient. This case of multi-organ failure with fatal outcome was considered to suggest 
a  possible  susceptibility  of  MS  patients  to  develop  a  severe  infection  due  to  lack  of  efficient  immune 
response.  
No  signals  for  severe  hypersensitivity  reactions  such  as  Stevens  -  Johnson  syndrome,  systemic 
anaphylactic  reactions  or  severe  skin  reactions  were  detected  more  frequently  in  the  teriflunomide 
groups compared to placebo during the entire clinical programme. In patients treated with the parent 
compound  leflunomide,  very  rare  cases  of  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome  or  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis 
were reported and therefore, the CHMP considered that a specific reference to skin reactions should be 
made in section 4.4 of the SmPC and  hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions were 
reflected in the RMP as an important identified risk. 
There was no indication of a carcinogenic risk in a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in rats and mice. 
The  frequency  of  cancer  as  solid  tumors  in  placebo-controlled  clinical  trials  was  not  higher  on 
teriflunomide as compared to placebo and no unusual pattern was observed. Although it is known that 
the  risk  of  malignancy,  particularly  lymphoproliferative  disorders,  is  increased  with  the  use  of  some 
immunosuppressive  agents,  the  CHMP  considered  re-assuring  that  no  cases  of  lymphoproliferative  or 
haematological malignancies were observed in the clinical programme of teriflunomide.  
The effect of teriflunomide on blood pressure was regularly monitored during the teriflunomide clinical 
development programme. Blood pressure measurements were  performed at each visit in the Phase 2 
and  3  studies.  Diastolic  and  systolic  blood  pressure  elevations  were  more  frequent  on  teriflunomide.

Nevertheless, 
in  patients  who  developed  hypertension,  the 
introduction  or  modification  of 
antihypertensive  treatment  usually  led  to  good  control  of  blood  pressure.  There  were  no  reports  of 
hypertensive  emergencies,  or  of  acute  life-threatening  or  long-term  complications.  The  CHMP 
considered that the potential elevation of blood pressure is adequately reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 
of the SmPC. 
With  respect  to  cardiac  rhythm  abnormalities,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  available  data  did  not 
indicate an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia.  
In  an  adjunct  study  with  glatiramer  acetate,  one  case  of  interstitial  lung  disease,  possibly  related  to 
teriflunomide,  was  reported  and  two  cases  unlikely  related  to  teriflunomide  were  reported  in  the 
extension  studies.  Based  on  the  extent  of  patient  exposure,  a  rare  risk  of  drug-induced  pulmonary 
toxicity could not be excluded. While pulmonary toxicity was not suggested by the clinical database of 
teriflunomide,  the  interstitial  lung  disease  was  considered  an  important  identified  risk  based  on  an 
effect from observations with the parent compound leflunomide.  
Adverse  events  potentially  related  to  peripheral  neuropathy,  polyneuropathy,  paraesthesias  and 
neuralgia were reported in all treatment groups, but more frequently in teriflunomide treated patients. 
This observation was supported by pool A and pool B data as well as additional data from the TOWER 
study. In several cases, the event was considered serious and study discontinuation due to peripheral 
neuropathy was also reported. The CHMP concluded that peripheral neuropathy should be reflected as 
an  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP  and  that  treatment  discontinuation  should  be  considered, 
together  with  performing  the  accelerated  elimination  procedure,  as  reflected  in  section  4.4  of  the 
SmPC. 
The CHMP considered the eight cases of death reported in the entire development programme, five of 
which were evaluated as possibly related to other concomitant pre-existing diseases or underlying MS 
itself  and  three  cases  as  possibly  related  to  the  drug  exposure.  Overall,  considering  the  fatal  cases 
observed, the CHMP was of the view that close monitoring was essential with respect to the increased 
risk  of  severe  infections  during  treatment  with  teriflunomide  as  well  as  of  potential  severe  cardiac 
problems  such  as  acute  heart  failure  and  myocardial  infarction.  The  respective  pharmacovigilance 
activities are reflected in the RMP. 
With  regard  to  laboratory  data,  teriflunomide  led  to  a  decrease  (of  at  most  15%)  in  neutrophils  and 
lymphocytes  and  smaller  mean  decreases  in  platelet  and  RBC  counts  and  to  greater  increase  in  ALT, 
AST and SGGT than placebo. The CHMP considered that the review of other haematology and clinical 
chemistry  variables,  blood  pressure,  pulse  rate,  body  temperature,  body  weight  and  ECG  recordings 
did not reveal any clinically relevant safety findings attributable to treatment with teriflunomide. 
The CHMP also considered that the safety will be further confirmed with more long-term data from the 
ongoing studies. 
No  post-marketing  experience  was  available,  as  teriflunomide  was  not  marketed  in  any  country; 
however,  the  post-marketing  experience  with  Arava  (leflunomide,  parent  compound  of  teriflunomide) 
was  considered  relevant  for  the  safety  profile  of  teriflunomide.  In  general,  the  safety  database  from 
the  clinical  experience  with  teriflunomide  in  MS  patients  did  not  present  new  and  unknown  AEs,  but 
was rather a confirmation of the experience with leflunomide. However, the overall safety database of 
leflunomide  is  much  larger;  thus,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  leflunomide  safety  data  should 
also be taken into account, especially those effects related to the mechanism of action, i.e. reduction of 
pyrimidine  dependent  cell  proliferation,  and  potentially 
linked 
to  safety 
issues  due 
to 
immunosuppression (opportunistic infections and PML). In this context, the CHMP considered that the 
Assessment report

risk  management  plan  and  product  information  of  teriflunomide  should  cover  all  important  identified 
and potential risks of leflunomide.  
Overall, the available safety data suggested that teriflunomide 14 mg has a manageable safety profile 
and, provided appropriate post-authorisation measures, can be used safely in the proposed indication. 
From  the  safety  database  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  were  included  in  the 
SmPC. 
Of  note,  while  the  applicant  only  applied  for  authorisation  of  the  14  mg  dose,  the  CHMP  discussed 
available  efficacy  and  safety  data  of  both  doses.  Based  on  the  data  presented,  the  CHMP  noted  that 
while the 14 mg dose was numerically more efficacious in terms of annualized relapse rate and delay in 
disability  progression,  the  data  on  the  7  mg  dose  also  suggested  efficacy.  As  the  lower  dose  might 
present an option of reducing dose for tolerability reasons, the CHMP recommended that the applicant 
should submit an application for the 7 mg strength in the post-authorisation phase. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of teriflunomide is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  Product  Information.  Appropriate  measures  including  additional  pharmacovigilance 
activities  and  risk  minimization  measures  were  put  in  place  to  ensure  safe  and  effective  use  of  the 
product in the recommended indication.  
The safety aspects are further discussed in the context of the overall benefit-risk balance.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  applicant  submitted  a  signed  Summary  of  the  Pharmacovigilance  System.  Provided  that  the 
Pharmacovigilance System Master File fully complies with the new legal requirements as set out in the 
Commission  Implementing  Regulation  and  as  detailed  in  the  respective  GVP  module,  the  CHMP 
considered the Summary of the Pharmacovigilance System acceptable.

Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.  New active substance status 
To determine whether a certain drug substance can be regarded as a New Active Substance (NAS) the 
requirements of Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC have to be taken into account: 
“The different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active 
substance  shall  be  considered  to  be  the  same  active  substance,  unless  they  differ  significantly  in 
properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 117/150 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
According to this, the NAS assessment has to follow a stepwise approach as illustrated in the following 
scheme: 
Thus, in first instance the chemical relationship of teriflunomide and its parent compound leflunomide 
has to be studied (see section 2.9.1 below). If a positive NAS-categorisation is however not regarded 
justified from a chemical point of view, then other evidence from clinical and non-clinical data will have 
to be taken into account (see section 2.9.2). 
2.9.1.  Chemical differences - Classification of teriflunomide as derivative of 
leflunomide 
From a chemical point of view, it can be easily concluded that both, teriflunomide and leflunomide are 
not related as different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers or complexes. The relevant 
question  is,  whether  teriflunomide  and  leflunomide  can  be  regarded  as  derivatives.  In  the  chemical 
literature various definitions are given for the term “derivative”: 
Examples for the definition of the term “derivative”: 
• 
• 
“Any compound that may, at least theoretically, be formed from another compound to which it 
is structurally related.”1 
“A  chemical  compound  that  may  be  produced  from  another  compound  of  similar  structure  in 
one or more steps.”2

Both definitions are based on two elements: The conversion, at least theoretical, from one to the other 
and their structural relationship. 
i. Chemical interconversion 
Teriflunomide is the main active in vivo metabolite of leflunomide. Upon administration of leflunomide, 
70 % of the drug administered converts into teriflunomide. The only difference between the molecules 
is  the  opening  of  the  isoxazole  ring.  This  is  considered  a  simple  structural  modification  and  a 
technically simple one-step synthetic transformation. The ring-opening of 3-unsubstituted isoxazoles to 
afford α-cyanoenol (or isomeric cyanocarbonyl) derivatives has been known since the pioneering work 
of Claisen in 18913. The reaction proceeds rapidly and cleanly via a E2-elimination mechanism, without 
other intermediates, upon treatment with base at ambient temperature. These conditions would also, 
for  example,  hydrolyse  an  ester  to  its  corresponding  carboxylic  acid.  Since  the  ring-opening  of  3-
unsubstituted  isoxazoles  is  so  facile  and  selective,  several  synthetic  processes  have  been  developed 
which  take  advantage  of  this  transformation  as  the  first  step,  effectively  using  3-unsubstituted 
isoxazoles as latent α-cyanocarbonyl compounds4. In the case under consideration, leflunomide could 
be easily converted to teriflunomide by treatment with base. The electron-withdrawing amide carbonyl 
moiety  at  the  4-position  will  facilitate  this  process.  This  conversion  has  already  been  demonstrated 
in vivo  in  human  plasma.  In  addition,  teriflunomide  is  listed  as  a  potential  impurity  of  leflunomide  in 
the Ph.Eur. monograph of leflunomide. 
The applicant argues that the fact that teriflunomide is a metabolite of leflunomide should not be taken 
into  account,  and  that  similarity  must  be  assessed  based  on  the  chemical  quality  aspects  and  the 
similarity coefficients. However, it should not be overruled that a derivative is a compound that may, 
at least theoretically, be formed from another compound. In this respect, it is noted that the applicant 
uses a synthetic route not involving leflunomide for the synthesis of teriflunomide, but this should not 
constitute an argument to conclude that teriflunomide is not a derivative of teriflunomide. Most of the 
molecules can be synthetized by different syntheses (e.g.generics), and applicants may choose to use 
one or another route. There is no scientific reason to conclude that in this case teriflunomide is not a 
derivative  because  the  route  of  synthesis  employed  by  the  applicant  does  not  use  the  parent 
compound,  whereas,  instead,  the  opening  of  the  isoxazole  ring  of  leflunomide  as  a  synthethic  step 
would entail that teriflunomide is a derivative. 
As  mentioned  above,  teriflunomide  is  an  in vivo  metabolite  of  leflunomide.  Upon  administration  of 
leflunomide  in vivo,  the  isoxazole  ring  of  leflunomide  is  opened  and  teriflunomide  is  formed5. 
Therefore,  regardless  of  the  substance  administered  (leflunomide  or  teriflunomide)  it  is  the  same 
molecule  (teriflunomide)  the  one  exerting  the  pharmacological,  immunological  or  metabolic  action  in 
view of restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions, and does not present, in clinical use, 
a new chemical entity to patients.

In  the  latest  response  document,  the  applicant  objected  that  simple  “zero-dimensional”  calculations 
like those exclusively based on molecular weight differences are not suitable for similarity assessment. 
Indeed,  it  is  agreed  that  single  aspects  of  a  chemical  substance,  like  molecular  weight,  functional 
groups,  or  the  total  number  of  certain  chemical  elements  are  not  a  sufficient  indicator  for  similarity 
comparisons when assessed alone. However, the final conclusion of the QWP report is clearly based on 
the entirety of different molecular properties assessed in combination: 
• 
The 
leflunomide  molecule 
is 
composed 
of 
an 
amide 
substituted  with 
a 
4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl  in  the  N-position  and  5-methylisoxazol  ring  linked  to  the  carbonyl 
side  of  the  amide.  Teriflunomide  molecule  also  consists  of  an  amide  substituted  with  a 
4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl  in  the  N-position,  whereas  the  carbonyl  side  of  the  amide  is 
substituted  by  a  linear  chain,  which  results  from  ring  opening  of  the  5-methylisoxazol  ring. 
Thus,  both  molecules  share  the  4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl  and  amide  groups,  which  represent 
more than 69 % of their molecular structure. The only difference between the two molecules is 
the  opening  of  the  isoxazole  ring  that  can  be  technically  performed  in  a  simple  one-step 
transformation. 
•  Both  leflunomide  and  teriflunomide  have  the  identical  molecular  formula  (C 12H 9F3N2O2)  and, 
hence,  the  same  relative  molecular  mass,  number  of  carbons  and  hydrogens  as  well  as 
heteroatoms,  i.e.  fluorines,  nitrogens  and  oxygens.  Moreover,  both  molecules  are  structural 
isomers. 
• 
Like  other  derivatives  or  pro-drugs,  some  physico-chemical  properties  are  different  between 
teriflunomide and leflunomide (see table 1). Beneficially altering these properties is one reason 
pro-drugs  are  developed.  In  addition,  it  should  be  taken  into  consideration  that  different 
polymorphs or solvates of a substance can have different chemical and physical properties, and 
this  would  not  result  on  them  being  a  different  drug  substance.  Nonetheless,  the  compounds 
share many similarities in the physico-chemical properties that are particularly relevant to their 
in vivo performance (e.g. the insolubility in water, bioavailability and the categorisation in BCS 
class II).

Taking  all  these  aspects  into  consideration,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  differences  between  both 
molecules  (namely,  opening  of  the  isoxazole  ring)  are  minor,  and  both  molecules  are  structurally 
similar. 
Similarity assessment based on similarity calculations 
The  applicant  makes  reference  to  the  assessment  of  similarity  in  the  context  of  orphan  medicinal 
products.  For  the  comparison  of  leflunomide  vs.  teriflunomide  some  similarity  calculations  performed 
by  the  company  and  in  addition  by  an  independent  expert  are  presented  using  the  Tanimoto 
coefficients  in  combination  with  structure-based  molecular  fingerprints.  The  applicant  concluded  that 
the calculated Tanimoto values clearly suggest a classification as different molecular structures. 
In view of the applicant’s claim the CHMP has performed the structural similarity evaluation as per the 
orphan drug legislation. However, such similarity assessment is not meant to define whether an active 
substance is to be considered new active substance or not, but only whether two active substance are 
to  be  considered  similar  within  the  meaning  of  Article  3(3)(c)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 
847/2000.  This  evaluation  takes  into  consideration  the  molecular  structural  features,  the  1D 
descriptors and the similarity coefficients using different fingerprints. The outcome of the evaluation is 
that  considering  all  these  elements,  namely  the  1D  descriptors  (molecular  structure,  molecular 
formula,  atoms  of  carbon,  hydrogen  and  heteroatoms,  relative  molecular  mass,  functional  groups, 
number  of  rings,  phenyl  rings  etc.)  and  the  supportive  information  from  the  similarity  coefficients 
calculated,  it  can  be  concluded  that  both  molecules  are  similar  in  the  context  of  the  orphan  drug 
legislation (see separate QWP report on structural similarity). Five different fingerprints (2D descriptors 
FCFP_4,  ECFP_4,  MDL  Public  Keys,  FCFC_4  and  ECFC_4)    and  one  unidentified  fingerprint  from  an 
external  expert  were  used  to  convert  the  chemical  structures  into  a  binary  form,  and  three  different 
similarity  coefficients  (Tanimoto,  Dice  and  Cosine)  based  on  these  fingerprints  were  calculated.  As 
expected  there  is  variability  in  the  values  of  the  similarity  coefficients  (Tanimoto,  Dice,  Cosine) 
obtained  with  the  different  types  of  fingerprints.  However,  taking  into  account  all  calculated  values  it 
was  considered  that  the  molecules  are  similar  based  on  the  principles  that  QWP  uses  to  establish 
structural similarity in the context of the orphan drug legislation (see Appendix 1 -QWP report). 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 121/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The  different  values  of  similarity  coefficients  obtained  are  related  to  the  type  of  fingerprint  selected. 
Therefore,  the  similarity  assessment  should  not  just  focus  on  one  single  aspect  (i.e.  fingerprint  and 
one similarity calculation), but should be based on different molecular descriptors, which are assessed 
in combination. 
Conclusion on Chemical Differences 
Based  on  all  these  aspects  (chemical 
interconversion  and  structural  relationship/similarity 
assessment),  CHMP  came  to  the  conclusion  that  teriflunomide  is  a  structurally  related  metabolite  of 
leflunomide,  a  derivative  of  an  already  authorised  active  substance.  Both  molecules  share  the  same 
structural features, differences in molecular structure are only minor. 
2.9.2.  Significant difference in safety and/or efficacy to justify the new 
active substance status 
2.9.2.1.  Introduction 
With  respect  to  Directive 2001/20/EC,  Directive   2010/63/EU,  the  ICH  E6 (R1)  guideline  on  GCP 
(CPMP/ICH/135/95)  and  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  (1996)  the  Applicant  suggested  that  comparative 
non-clinical  and  clinical  investigations  to  prove  a  NAS  claim  would  be  unethical  and  even  illegal.  
However, the CHMP pointed out that the “Reflection paper on considerations given to designation of a 
single-stereo isomeric form (enantiomer), a complex, a derivative, or a different salt or  ester  as new 
active substance in relation to the relevant reference active substance” (EMA/651649/2010) explicitly 
indicates  that  significant  difference  in  safety  and/or  efficacy  to  justify  the  NAS  claim  could  be 
substantiated based on non-clinical evidence if it is conclusive or likely to result in significant changes 
in clinical efficacy or safety: 
“2.3.1 Evidence likely to be sufficient 
•  Compelling preclinical data where it is not feasible to conduct head to head clinical studies, e.g. 
differences in reproductive toxicity or carcinogenicity, or the reference active substance is not 
authorised for the proposed indication. 
2.3.2 Evidence unlikely to be sufficient 
• 
Preclinical differences that are inconclusive or unlikely to result in significant changes in clinical 
efficacy or safety.” 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  non-clinical  evidence  would  not  necessarily  have  to  be  based  on 
direct  comparative  animal  testing,  provided  that  findings  based  on  indirect  non-clinical  comparisons 
were compelling and of clinical relevance.  
The  non-clinical  and  clinical  evidence  provided  by  the  applicant  to  demonstrate  differences  between 
teriflunomide and leflunomide is summarised and discussed below.  
2.9.2.2.  Potential non-clinical and clinical differences between teriflunomide and 
leflunomide 
Despite  the  same  pharmacological  mechanism  of  action  of  teriflunomide  and  leflunomide,  possible 
clinical differences in the efficacy of both substances cannot be deduced from available data, because 
the proposed therapy of multiple sclerosis with teriflunomide completely differs from the treatment of

rheumatoid  arthritis  for  which  leflunomide  received  MA.  Therefore,  the  applicant  focussed  on 
potentially  different  pharmacokinetic,  non-clinical  and  clinical  safety  properties  of  the  two  agents, 
which are summarised below. 
CYP1A2-mediated metabolism 
Teriflunomide is formed as major metabolite of leflunomide by opening of the isoxazole ring catalysed 
predominantly  by  the  cytochrome  P450  isozyme  CYP1A2  for  which  different  genetic  polymorphisms 
exist. As CYP1A2 plays only a minor role in the metabolism of teriflunomide, it can be anticipated that 
CYP1A2  genetic  heterogeneity  is  not  associated  with  side  effects  of  teriflunomide.  This  absence  of 
CYP1A2-mediated metabolism might reduce the propensity of teriflunomide for interactions with other 
drugs during MS therapy (e.g. ciprofloxacin, fluoroquinolones) and for pharmacogenomic variability. 
However,  the  two  enzymes  CYP2C19  and  CYP3A4  are  additionally  involved  in  the  opening  of  the 
isoxazole  ring  of  leflunomide.  The  relationship  between  genetic  polymorphism  and  PK  parameters  is 
weakened  if  more  than  one  enzyme  contributes  to  the  metabolism  of  a  drug,  as  the  deficit  of  one 
enzyme  may  be  balanced  by  the  other  (Porcelli  S  et al.  2011).  Subjects  who  may  lack  two  enzyme 
systems (1A2 or 2C19; 3A4 shows no polymorphism at all) are rather rare. 
Moreover,  the  pharmacogenomic  study  of  Bohanec  Grabar  et al.  (2008)  cited  by  the  applicant  bears 
two major deficits: 
1)  No PK data of leflunomide were reported and no PK data of metabolites (including teriflunomide) 
were analysed, whereas the sample size for the aimed toxicological evaluation was rather small. 
2)  The  genotype  of  the  CYP1A2*1F  allele  was  determined  and  from  this  information  the  CYP1A2 
activity was concluded. Indeed there are several published studies that indicate that this allele is 
associated  with  increased  inducibility.  The  individual  induction  depends  highly  on  environmental 
and  dietary  factors  (Le  Marchand  et al.  1997).  However  no  genotype/phenotype  relationship  has 
been established for this enzyme system yet. 
Regarding  extrinsic  factors,  the  results  of  interaction  studies  of  leflunomide  or  teriflunomide  with 
rifampin  (weak  CYP  1A2  inducer,  inducer  of  CYP2C19  und  CYP3A4)  did  not  indicate  any  benefit  for 
teriflunomide.  Studies  investigating  the  impact  of  CYP1A2  inhibitors  on  teriflunomide  formation  have 
not  been  provided.  In  summary,  no  reliable  information  has  been  provided,  that  the  missing 
metabolism of teriflunomide step via CYP1A2 leads to a clinically relevant benefit. 
Hepatotoxic potential 
Apart  from  teriflunomide,  the  biotransformation  of  leflunomide  generates  five  additional  metabolites 
that  are  not  formed  from  teriflunomide.  The  in silico  analyses of  these  five  metabolites using  DEREK, 
MultiCase  and  Leadscope  software  identified  a  hepatotoxic  risk  for  methyl-hydroxy  leflunomide, 
methyl-hydroxy leflunomide glucuronide and leflunomide due to their isoxazole amide scaffold. As the 
isoxazole amide moiety is lost during ring opening, a similar hepatotoxic potential was not assumed for 
teriflunomide and the other metabolites of leflunomide. 
The  in silico  findings  were  further  pursued  in vitro.  Both  teriflunomide  and  leflunomide  showed 
comparably low cytotoxicity in rat and human primary hepatocytes in vitro (TC 50 = ~200 –  500 µM), 
whereas leflunomide was more cytotoxic than teriflunomide in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell 
line  HepG2.  This  cytotoxicity  was  further  addressed  in  mechanistic  investigations  in  isolated 
mitochondria,  where  leflunomide  was  10-fold  more  potent  than  teriflunomide  to  inhibit  state III 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 123/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
complexes of the respiratory chain and 2- to 5-fold more potent to uncouple state II respiration. This 
uncoupling  effect  might  be  responsible  for  the  identified  reductions  in  ATP  levels  with  concomitantly 
increased generation of superoxide anions as evident in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. 
In  terms  of  clinical  safety,  the  CHMP  considered  that  in  comparison  to  leflunomide,  the  potentially 
lower hepatotoxic potential of teriflunomide is of minor clinical relevance with no significant benefits for 
patients  treated  with  teriflunomide.  Liver  toxicity,  most  prominent  in  patients  with  pre-existent  liver 
disease  or  concomitant  use  of  other  hepatotoxic  drugs,  seems  to  be  one  of  the  most  serious  safety 
issues  of  teriflunomide.  Most  rheumatoid  arthritis  patients,  who  experienced  severe  liver  injury  with 
leflunomide  treatment  had  one  or  multiple  underlying  risk  factors  for  hepatotoxicity  including 
concomitant  NSAID  or  methotrexate  therapy,  previous  or  concurrent  alcohol  abuse,  or  viral  or 
autoimmune  hepatitis.  This  presumably  accounts  for  the  fewer  or  milder  hepatic  side  effects  during 
clinical treatment with teriflunomide compared to leflunomide therapy. 
Genotoxicity of 4-TFMA 
Clinical  determinations  of  the  urinary  excretion  rate  of  4-TFMA  oxanilic  acid  suggest  that  the  initial 
formation  of  the  potentially  genotoxic  metabolite  4-TFMA  by  direct  hydrolysis  of  leflunomide  is  very 
extensive  until  all  leflunomide  has  been  converted  to  teriflunomide.  This  is  in  agreement  with  more 
than  4-fold  higher  mean  maximum  plasma  concentrations  measured  after  administration  of  20 mg 
leflunomide in RA patients (23.3 ng/ml) compared to 14 mg teriflunomide in MS patients (5.3 ng/ml). 
However,  genotoxic  effects  of  4-TFMA  were  only  determined  in vitro  at  a  LOEL  of  50 µg/ml  and  were 
not  confirmed  in  animals,  most  probably  because  this  level  is  not  achievable  in vivo  below  acutely 
lethal doses. Accordingly, it remains highly questionable if the safety margins calculated based on the 
in vitro  LOEL  and  the  mean  maximum  plasma  concentrations  in  patients  of  at  least  2000  after 
leflunomide  or  9000  after  teriflunomide  administration  indeed  translate  into  a  clinically  meaningful 
difference.  
Carcinogenic potential 
Malignant  lymphoma,  bronchio-alveolar  adenoma  and  carcinoma  were  detected  in  a  carcinogenicity 
study with leflunomide in mice, but not in rats. In contrast, no carcinogenic potential of teriflunomide 
was  evident  in  either  species.  The  Applicant  aimed  to  attribute  the  carcinogenicity  seen  with 
leflunomide  in  mice  to  4-TFMA.  Nonetheless,  as  detailed  in  the  section  on  genotoxicity  of  4-TFMA 
above, the LOEL for genotoxicity of 4-TFMA is regarded not achievable beyond lethal doses in vivo. The 
CHMP also highlighted that while rats are known to be more sensitive to aromatic amines like 4-TFMA 
than  mice,  carcinogenicity  studies  with  leflunomide  and  teriflunomide  in  rats  were  both  negative. 
Consequently, the putative differences in terms of carcinogenicity seen only in mice remain elusive and 
were hence not considered to be relevant for human therapy. 
Cataract formation 
Cataract  formation  was  detected  at  leflunomide  mid  and  high  doses  (≥ 3 mg/kg/day)  in  the  oral 
carcinogenicity  study  in  rats.  Despite  these  lens  opacities  occurred  at  a  more  than  3-fold  higher 
incidence  compared  to  controls,  they  are  a  common  age-related  phenomenon  in  this  species. 
Moreover,  a  dose-relation  was  only  implied  for  female  rats,  whereas  incidences  of  cataracts  were 
randomly  scattered  across  male  dose  groups  treated  with  leflunomide.  Likewise,  cataracts  were 
irregularly distributed across both genders in rats that had received teriflunomide in a carcinogenicity 
Assessment report

study,  albeit  at  lower  incidences.  Interestingly,  leflunomide  did  not  promote  cataract  formation  in  a 
41 day  study  in  rats.  Although  a  drug-related  effect  of  leflunomide  could  not  be  absolutely  excluded, 
the  clinical  relevance  of  the  cataract  formation  remains  disputable,  as  no  particular  human  risk  has 
been identified since marketing authorisation of leflunomide. 
Pancreatic toxicity, chronic progressive nephropathy and amyloidosis 
Pancreatic  toxicity  comprising  minimal  to  moderate  acinar  degeneration,  necrosis  of  individual  acinar 
cells, 
fibrosis  and 
infiltration  of 
inflammatory  cells  were  observed  at  teriflunomide  doses 
≥ 0.8 mg/kg/day  in  the  12 months  toxicity  study  in  dogs,  but  not  after  leflunomide  treatment. 
Following  teriflunomide  administration,  pancreatic  toxicities  were  only  accompanied  by  reduced 
trypsin-like  immunoreactivity  in  the  study  animals,  whereas  pancreatic  levels  of  amylase  or  lipase 
remained unchanged. In the clinical program, pancreatic enzyme levels were generally unaffected and 
there was no clear correlation between incidences of pancreatitis and teriflunomide administration. As 
dogs appear to be more susceptible to teriflunomide treatment than humans, the clinical significance of 
the rather mild pancreatic toxicity findings after teriflunomide administration of dogs is uncertain. 
In  a  carcinogenicity  study  in  mice,  chronic  progressive  nephropathy  (CPN)  was  limited  to  females  of 
the 12 mg/kg/day teriflunomide high dose group only. On the contrary, no such findings were apparent 
with  leflunomide  in  carcinogenicity  investigations  in  this  species.  Similarly,  moderate  amyloidosis  of 
several  organs  (mainly  stomach,  intestine,  pancreas,  liver,  kidney,  spleen,  lymph  node,  salivary  and 
adrenal glands, thyroid/parathyroid) was seen with teriflunomide, but not leflunomide, in both genders 
of the high dose group in the carcinogenicity study in mice. 
The applicant ascribed the CPN and amyloidosis findings to the inflammatory lesions provoked by the 
anti-inflammatory  activity  of  teriflunomide.  However,  teriflunomide  treatment  neither  caused  CPN  in 
male  mice,  nor  in  rats  and  amyloidosis  was  restricted  to  mice.  Likewise,  no  CPN  or  amyloidosis  was 
evident  in  the  carcinogenicity  study  of  leflunomide  in  mice  or  rats,  although  teriflunomide  and 
leflunomide  share  the  same  pharmacodynamic  activity.  As  CPN  is  very  common  in  rodents  and  both 
CPN  and  amyloidosis  are  well  known  to  develop  spontaneously  with  age,  thus  complicating  toxicity 
evaluations, their clinical relevance is highly debatable 6,7,8. 
2.9.3.  Regulatory aspects 
Consistency with former decisions on other compounds 
The  applicant  has  raised  the  issue  of  consistency  by  referring  to  the  CHMP’s  assessment  of  similar 
active substances in the past.  
Reference  is  made  to  Chapter  1  of  Volume  2A  of  the  Notice  to  Applicants  where  it  is  stated  that  the 
decision whether a different form of the active substance is to be regarded as a new active substance 
should be taken by the competent authorities on a case-by-case basis.

In 2010 the CHMP started developing a draft reflection paper that provides clarification on the criteria 
to  be  applied  in  the  scientific  assessment  of  a  new  active  substance  status  by  the  Competent 
Authorities.  
It has to be explained that the CHMP commenced with systematic evaluation of the NAS status within 
the  assessment  procedure,  which  translates  into  an  explicit  statement  of  the  scientific  conclusion  on 
the  NAS  claim,  leading  to  the  decision  on  granting  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  following  the 
judgement in Case T-275/099. In this case the Court of Justice (ECJ) has recognised that an evaluation 
of the NAS by the CHMP is a preparatory act to the decision to grant the marketing authorisation.10 As 
a development the CHMP has adopted a policy of systematic scientific evaluation of the NAS as a step 
within the MA assessment procedure which is reflected in the final “Reflection paper on considerations 
given  to  designation  of  a  single-stereo  isomeric  form  (enantiomer),  a  complex,  a  derivative,  or  a 
different  salt  or  ester  as  new  active  substance  in  relation  to  the  relevant  reference  active  substance” 
(EMA/651649/2010).  
With  respect  to  the  applicant´s  reference  to  products  Neoclarityn  (authorised  in  2001)  and  (Invega 
authorised in 2007), it needs to be highlighted that no systematic NAS assessment was conducted at 
the time of the MAA of these products for the reasons described above. 
The  CHMP  also  noted  that  the  applicant  has  re-produced  a  table  from  the  literature  of 
pharmacologically active metabolites and parent drugs where each active metabolite was considered a 
new  drug11.  It  should  be  noted,  that  the  scientific  publication12  from  which  the  table  provided  was 
extracted  states:  “Actually,  active  metabolites  having  improved  pharmacological  activity  or  lower 
toxicity than those parent compounds were already marketed as new drugs”. This further supports the 
CHMP  position,  i.e.  requesting  the  applicant  to  provide  clinical  and  non-clinical  evidence  to 
demonstrate significant differences in safety and/or efficacy between teriflunomide and leflunomide. 
2.9.4.  Conclusion 
Overall,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  teriflunomide  is  a  derivative  of  leflunomide,  since  the  only 
difference  between  both  molecules  is  the  opening  of  the  isoxazole  ring.  This  is  considered  to  be  a 
simple  structural  modification,  which  occurs  by  a  single  metabolic  step  in vivo  and  can  be  also 
achieved  in vitro  via  a  simple  one-step  synthetic  transformation.  Furthermore,  the  evidence  provided 
by the applicant to demonstrate significant differences in properties with regard to safety and efficacy 
indicated  rather  minor  differences  between  teriflunomide  and  leflunomide  with  unknown  or 
questionable clinical relevance, as detailed in section 2.9.2. Therefore, the available underlying data to 
the MAA did not allow concluding that teriflunomide qualifies as a NAS.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-inflammatory properties that selectively and 
reversibly inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DH), required for 
the  de  novo  pyrimidine  synthesis.  As  a  consequence,  teriflunomide  reduces  the  proliferation  of 
dividing cells that need de novo synthesis of pyrimidine to expand. The exact mechanism by which 
teriflunomide  exerts  its  therapeutic  effect  in  MS  is  not  fully  understood,  but  this  is  mediated  by  a 
reduced number of lymphocytes.  
The  anti-proliferative  potency  of  teriflunomide  including  its  efficacy  in  well-established  animal 
models  of  multiple  sclerosis  using  both  prophylactic  and  therapeutic  administrations  was  reliably 
documented in the dossier. A delayed onset and diminished severity of the disease were observed in 
these studies. 
Efficacy of teriflunomide, as monotherapy, in the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting 
multiple  sclerosis  was  supported  with  data  generated  in  a  proof-of-concept  study  and  phase  III 
clinical trials.  
In study 2001, an effect was observed on the change from baseline to week 36 in mean number of 
unique  active  lesions  per  MRI.  The  difference  from  baseline  to  end  of  study  was  5.2%  for  placebo 
and  -2.5%  for  teriflunomide  14  mg.  The  difference  between  teriflunomide  14  mg  and  placebo  was 
statistically significant (p=0.0215). With respect to the secondary clinical endpoints, the proportion 
of  patients  with  MS  relapses  was  37.7%  and  23.2%  for  placebo  and  teriflunomide  14  mg, 
respectively.  Although  there  was  a  positive  trend  for  the  14  mg  dose,  this  difference  was  not 
statistically significant. The proportion of patients with EDSS progression was 21.3% and  7.4% for 
placebo  and  teriflunomide  14  mg,  respectively.  The  difference  versus  placebo  was  statistically 
significant for the 14 mg teriflunomide group. 
In  the  TEMSO  study,  the  effect  was  observed  on  the  annual  relapse  rate,  which  was  0.539  and 
0.369  for  placebo  and  14  mg  teriflunomide,  respectively.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  3-month 
sustained disability progression was 23.7% and 17.3% for placebo and 14 mg, respectively and the 
difference for the hazard ratio of 0.702 was statistically significant for the 14 mg group (p=0.0279). 
The  MRI  findings  supported  the  results  of  the  study.  No  efficacy  was  demonstrated  on  the  patient 
reported outcomes (FIS and MSFC) or on quality of life variables (SF-36 and EQ-5D).  
Results  of  the  TEMSO  study  were  supported  by  a  second  placebo-controlled  study  TOWER.  The 
effect  was  shown  on  the  adjusted  ARR,  0.501  in  the  placebo  group  and  0.319  in  the  14  mg 
teriflunomide group. This corresponded to a statistically significant relative risk reduction of 36.3% 
(p=0.0001)  in  the  teriflunomide  14  mg  group.  Teriflunomide  14  mg  also  statistically  significantly 
reduced  the  time  to  12-week  sustained  disability  progression  compared  to  placebo  with  a  relative 
reduction in the hazard ratio of 31.5% (p=0.0442). The estimated percentage of patients with 12-
week  sustained  disability  progression  at  week  48  was  14.2%  and  7.8%  in  the  placebo  and  14  mg 
teriflunomide  groups,  respectively.  With  respect  to  time  to  first  multiple  sclerosis  relapse,  the 
estimated  proportion  of  patients  free  of  confirmed  relapses  at  Week  48  was  60.6%  in  the  placebo 
group  and  76.3%  in  the  teriflunomide  14  mg  group.  The  statistically  significant  hazard  reduction 
was 36.9% (p<0.0001) for the teriflunomide 14 mg group.

The  results  from  the  integrated  analysis  of  both  trials  indicated  consistency  in  the  efficacy  data, 
based on the ARR and time to 3-month sustained disability progression.  
In general, the effect observed in the TEMSO and TOWER study was perceived in the range of the 
treatment effects seen for interferon beta and glatiramer acetate.  
Oral  administration  was  considered  a  benefit  as  compared  to  products  with  a  subcutaneous  or 
intramuscular administration.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In the TENERE study, the estimated cumulative rate of treatment failure was 41.1% and 44.4% at 
96  weeks  for  the  14  mg  teriflunomide  group  and  Rebif,  respectively.  With  respect  to  the  risk  of 
treatment failure 14 mg teriflunomide group vs Rebif, the hazard ratio was 0.861 (p-value: 0.5953). 
Overall,  this  active  controlled  study  failed  in  its  primary  objective,  which  was  to  demonstrate 
superiority  over  Rebif.  The  CHMP  considered  that  this  rendered  the  TENERE  study  inconclusive,  as 
due  to  the  uncertainty  about  assay  sensitivity,  it  could  not  be  concluded  that  teriflunomide  had  a 
similar efficacy to Rebif.  The rate of permanent treatment discontinuation (as a component of the 
primary endpoint) was higher in the Rebif group than in teriflunomide: 13.5% and 24.0% in the 14 
mg  teriflunomide  and  Rebif  groups,  respectively.  On  the  other  hand,  the  rate  of  relapse  (as  a 
component of the primary endpoint) was lower in the Rebif group than in the 14 mg teriflunomide 
group,  23.4%,  and  15.4%  in  the  14  mg  teriflunomide  and  Rebif  group,  respectively.  The  ARR  was 
0.259  and  0.216  for  the  14  mg  teriflunomide  group  and  Rebif,  respectively.  Analysing  the 
components  of  the  primary  endpoint,  i.e.  reasons  for  treatment  failure,  the  CHMP  considered  that 
for  teriflunomide  these  were  attributed  to  lack  of  efficacy  (relapses),  whereas  for  Rebif,  treatment 
failure  was  mostly  due  to  poor  tolerability.  This  was  considered  indicative  of  lower  efficacy  of 
teriflunomide.  
With  respect  to  the  MS  type  of  patients  enrolled  in  the  studies,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
majority of patients in the study programme were patients with RRMS  and  the number  of patients 
with  secondary  progressive  MS  and  superimposed  relapses  was  limited.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  extrapolation  of  efficacy  was  not  supported  by  the  mechanistic  considerations  and 
that the data from the respective subgroup analyses did not show sufficient evidence of efficacy in 
terms of effect on the relapse rate in patients with SPMS and PRMS (and superimposed relapses), as 
discussed  in  detail  in  section  2.5.3.  Overall,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  efficacy  could  not  be 
reasonably extrapolated from the RRMS to the broader population presenting with RMS. 
In  order  to  identify  and  substantiate  the  patient  population  which  would  benefit  most  from 
treatment  with  teriflunomide,  the  applicant  provided  a  number  of  subgroup  analyses  based  on 
baseline characteristics, such as disease severity and disease activity. An effect on relapse rate and 
disability  progression  (time  to  3-month  sustained  disability  progression)  was  sufficiently  shown 
across a number of treatment groups of patients, including patients with high disease activity. With 
respect  to  the  definition  of  the  high  disease  activity  “patients  with  at  least  2  relapses  in  past  year 
and 1 Gd lesion at baseline” used by the applicant, the CHMP considered that it is analogous to the 
second  part  of  the  indication  for  Tysabri  and  Gilenya,  and  although  a  general  consensus  over  the 
definition of high disease activity is currently lacking, this approach was accepted.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In  clinical  studies,  teriflunomide  caused  adverse  effects  on  the  liver  with  potentially  serious 
consequences. Teriflunomide caused elevations of liver enzymes, typically within the first six months 
of treatment, followed by stabilisation. A total of six patients in the clinical studies met the criteria 
for  Hy’s  law;  these  cases  were  attributed  to  the  teriflunomide  treatment.  Therefore,  the  CHMP 
considered that there was a risk of serious hepatic adverse reactions. The data on reversibility of the 
hepatic toxicity upon treatment continuation with teriflunomide was not considered sufficiently solid 
to support a specific claim that hepatic toxicity could be reversible upon treatment continuation with 
14 mg teriflunomide in cases of mild elevations (ALT ≤ 3 ULN). 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  bone  marrow  disorders  was  higher  for  teriflunomide  compared  to 
placebo.  Teriflunomide  led  to  a  decrease  in  neutrophils  and  lymphocytes  of  at  most  15%  and 
smaller  mean  decreases  in  platelet  and  RBC  counts.  Isolated  cases  of  significant  cytopenias,  e.g. 
thrombocytopenia, and cases of more significant decrease in white blood cell count were observed. 
The  effect  of  teriflunomide  on  the  immune  system  and  a  trend  for  a  higher  proportion  of  serious 
infections  in  the  teriflunomide  groups  (respiratory  tract,  lung  infections  and  possible  herpes  viral 
infections) was discerned. 
Diastolic and systolic blood pressure elevations were more frequent on teriflunomide as compared to 
placebo.  Even  though  no increased  risk  was  observed  for  cardiac  arrhythmias  they  should  be  seen 
as adverse cardiovascular events potentially associated with blood pressure elevation. 
Alopecia,  diarrhoea,  nausea,  ALT  increase,  nasopharyngitis,  paraesthesia,  back  pain,  pain  in  limb, 
arthralgia, rash and abdominal pain were reported more common in the teriflunomide groups than in 
the placebo group. 
The  safety  database  of  leflunomide  was  also  taken  into  account  considering  that  the  effect  of 
leflunomide is completely mediated by its metabolite teriflunomide. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
With respect to opportunistic infections, the frequency of non-serious herpetic infections was higher 
on  teriflunomide  as  compared  to  placebo.  However,  no  signals  of  serious  systemic  opportunistic 
infections,  including  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy,  were  detected  in  the  clinical 
programme  of  teriflunomide.  Despite  the  non-serious  nature  of  cases  observed  and  the  lack  of 
clinical  signal  to  date,  since  teriflunomide  is  an  immunomodulator,  serious  opportunistic  infections 
were considered to be a potential risk. 
Teriflunomide  was  observed  to  cause  lymphopenia  and  also  neutropenia,  early  after  initiation  of 
treatment.  It  is  not  known  whether  the  number  of  circulating  lymphocytes  strictly  reflects  the 
immunocompetence  of  the  patient.  The  low  lymphocyte  and  neutrophil  counts  were  observed 
throughout teriflunomide treatment, with a tendency to decrease even further. A tendency to return 
towards  normal  range  after  treatment  discontinuation  was  observed.  However,  the  long-term  risks 
of serious infections associated with this effect are not known.  
Events  potentially  related  to  peripheral  neuropathy,  polyneuropathy,  paraesthesias  and  neuralgia 
were  reported  in  all  treatment  groups,  but  more  frequently  in  teriflunomide  treated  patients. 
Notwithstanding  the  clinical  presentation  of  the  events  was  highly  variable,  polyneuropathy  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 129/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
considered as a potential risk of teriflunomide. 
Although  no  signal  of  malignancy  was  observed  in  the  clinical  studies,  since  teriflunomide  impacts 
the immune system, and in light of the limited long-term experience, malignancy was considered as 
a potential risk to be followed carefully during the post-marketing period. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  teriflunomide  was  embryo-toxic  and  teratogenic  in  rats  and  rabbits  at 
doses  in  the  human  therapeutic  range.  Thus,  teriflunomide  was  considered  to  have  a  potential  to 
cause  serious  birth  defects,  when  administered  during  pregnancy.  Consequently,  women  of 
childbearing  potential  must  use  effective  contraception  during  therapy  and  use  of  teriflunomide 
during pregnancy is contraindicated. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
With respect to benefits of teriflunomide, the CHMP was of the view that the data presented by the 
applicant  showed  modest  but  clinically  relevant  efficacy  results  and  supported  the  use  of 
teriflunomide  as  a  first-line  treatment  in  the  RRMS  patient  population.  The  relative  effect  size 
observed in the placebo-controlled studies was considered comparable to the effect-size seen in the 
earlier  MS  studies  with  interferon  beta  and  glatiramer  (around  30%  risk  reduction  for  ARR).  With 
respect  to  disability  progression,  teriflunomide  was  observed  to  show  an  effect  on  the  3-month 
sustained disability progression endpoint.  
Direct comparison with an interferon beta (Rebif) as an active comparator failed to show superiority. 
This  study  was  considered  inconclusive  by  the  CHMP,  since  in  the  absence  of  placebo,  the  study 
lacked  assay  sensitivity  and  no  conclusions  on  similar  effects  of  teriflunomide  and  Rebif  could  be 
made. 
The  applicant  provided  a  number  of  subgroup  analyses  based  on  baseline  characteristics,  such  as 
disease  severity  and  disease  activity.  Based  on  these,  an  effect  on  relapse  rate  and  disability 
progression  (time  to  3-month  sustained  disability  progression)  was  sufficiently  shown  across  the 
treatment  groups  of  patients,  including  those  with  existing  high  disease  activity.  The  CHMP  was  of 
the view that no subgroup was identified, in which the benefits would be considered more robust or 
more convincing in comparison to others. 
The  safety  profile  of  teriflunomide  was  comparable  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  the  parent 
compound leflunomide and no new unexpected safety issues emerged in the clinical programme of 
teriflunomide. This was not unexpected given that teriflunomide is almost the sole active metabolite 
of  leflunomide.  Consequently,  the  safety  database  of  leflunomide  was  taken  into  account  in  the 
benefit-risk  balance  assessment.  In  particular,  the  CHMP  considered  the  safety  issues  such  as 
opportunistic infections, cases of PML and malignancies. While no signals of these were detected in 
the clinical programme of teriflunomide, the risk of their occurrence cannot be completely excluded, 
since both teriflunomide and leflunomide, being immunomodulators, have an impact on the immune 
system.  Of  note,  the  safety  data  from  the  clinical  programme  of  teriflunomide  already  included 
single  cases  of  tuberculosis  and  herpes  simplex  infections,  which  were  considered  an  indicator  of 
risk of opportunistic infections. 
The  most  prominent  adverse  events  observed  were  liver  toxicity,  gastrointestinal  events,  bone 
marrow  suppression,  infections  and  alopecia.  While gastrointestinal  events  were  mostly  considered 
as  mild  and  moderate  and  were  rarely  a  reason  for  treatment  discontinuation,  liver  toxicity, 
although asymptomatic, was a reason for treatment cessation in most cases. The data indicated that 
liver  toxicity  could  be  reversible,  but  required  a  rather  long  recovery  time  (up  to  two  years).  The 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 130/150 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
CHMP  considered  that  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  must  not  be  treated  with 
teriflunomide, which was reflected in section 4.3 of the SmPC. Furthermore, liver enzymes should be 
assessed  before  initiation  of  therapy  and  in  regular  intervals  afterwards  and  treatment  should  be 
discontinued if liver injury is suspected.  
The haematological effects (decrease in white blood cells, red blood cells and platelet counts)  were 
considered  to  warrant  assessment  of  the  complete  blood  cell  count  before  starting  treatment  and 
during  therapy  based  on  signs  and  symptoms  (e.g.  infections).  Patients  with  significantly  impaired 
bone  marrow  function  or  significant  anaemia,  leukopenia,  neutropenia  or  thrombocytopenia  must 
not be treated with teriflunomide, which is reflected in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
With  respect  to  infections,  the  most  frequently  reported  events  were  upper  respiratory  tract 
infections, especially nasopharyngitis. The risk of infection was considered attributable to the effect 
of teriflunomide on the immune system. Based on the data available, the CHMP considered that, in 
case of an infection, treatment with teriflunomide should not be started until the patient recovers.  
Alopecia  was  considered  a  severe  AE,  despite  its  non-threatening  feature,  as  it  can  be  socially 
debilitating, particularly for female subjects.  
The  CHMP  also  considered  the  reproductive  toxicity.  While  the  extent  of  teratogenic  effect  is  not 
known,  studies  in  animals  showed  reproductive  toxicity.  Teriflunomide  was  considered  to  have  a 
potential to cause serious birth defects, when administered during pregnancy. Therefore, women of 
childbearing  potential  are  required  to  use  effective  contraception  and  use  of  teriflunomide  during 
pregnancy is contraindicated. 
The  oral  route  of  administration  was  considered  an  advantage  above  the  first  line  interferon  beta 
and glatiramer acetate, which have to be injected either subcutaneously or intramuscularly. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  all  identified  and  potential  risks,  including  the  ones  based  on  the 
experience  with  leflunomide  were  adequately  addressed  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan  and  the 
Product Information.  
The overall benefit/risk of Aubagio in the RRMS indication was considered favourable.

New Active Substance Status 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  the  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  properties  of  the  active 
substance, the CHMP considers that teriflunomide which is a derivative of leflunomide is not qualified 
as a new active substance, as it does not differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or 
efficacy from the previously authorised substance.

Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 21 March 2013 
Following the CHMP conclusion that teriflunomide, the active substance of Aubagio, is not qualified as a 
new  active  substance,  the  applicant  submitted  detailed  grounds  for  the  re-examination  of  the  CHMP 
Opinion.  
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented their detailed grounds for re-examination in writing and at an oral explanation 
to the CHMP.  
Applicant´s position:  
On 21 March 2013 the CHMP issued a positive opinion for the approval of Aubagio (teriflunomide) for 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, but denied the NAS status. 
In particular, the applicant expressed disagreement with this conclusion, on the basis that 
i) teriflunomide is not a derivative of leflunomide, and, in any event, 
ii)  significant  differences  in  terms  of  safety  and  efficacy  between  both  compounds  have  been 
demonstrated. 
I) Teriflunomide is not a derivative of leflunomide 
Applicant´s position: (summarized) 
The  applicant  provided  the  following  arguments  in  support  of  their  claim  that  teriflunomide  is  not  a 
derivative of leflunomide: 
1.1 Proper interpretation of the term derivative under article 10.2(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
 (a) Assessment based on chemical composition of the product and not in vivo metabolism.  
The  CHMP  however  concluded  in  first  instance  that  teriflunomide  is  not  a  new  active  substance  for 
purposes of Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC, which stipulates: 
“The different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active 
substance  shall  be  considered  to  be  the  same  active  substance,  unless  they  differ  significantly  in 
properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy.” 
That definition expressly refers to a “medicinal product which has the same qualitative and quantitative 
composition …” as a reference product (emphasis added). It is thus based on the chemical composition 
of the product, and not on the possible metabolism in vivo, after administration to the patient. The fact 
that  one  active  substance  is  an  active  metabolite  of  another  (after  administration  to  the  patient)  is 
thus not relevant. 
This  also  clearly  follows  from  the  definition  of  “active  substance”  under  Article  1(3a)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC:  “Any  substance  or  mixture  of  substances  intended  to  be  used  in  the  manufacture  of  a 
medicinal product and that, when used in its production, becomes an active ingredient of that product 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013  
Page 135/150 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
intended  to  exert  a  pharmacological,  immunological  or  metabolic  action  with  a  view  to  restoring, 
correcting or modifying physiological functions or to make a medical diagnosis.” (emphasis added) 
The definition is based on the good manufacturing guidelines, which refer to the active substances as 
used  in  manufacturing.  The  CHMP  concluded  in  first  instance  that  teriflunomide  is  a  derivative  of 
leflunomide and therefore it is not a new active substance for purposes of Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 
2001/83/EC.  
Consequently, whether the active substance in a new medicinal product is a “salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture  of  isomers,  complex  or  derivative”  of  an  existing  active  substance  must  be  assessed  on  the 
basis of the chemical characteristics of the substance as it is present in the finished medicinal product. 
The fact that a substance is an in vivo metabolite of another is irrelevant. 
(b) Metabolites are not listed in Article 10(2)(b) 
Metabolites are not listed in the group of compounds covered by the presumption rule. 
(c) Interpretation in light of the structure of Article 10(2)(b) 
Article  10(2)(b)  includes  different  salts,  esters,  ethers,  isomers,  mixtures  of  isomers,  complexes  and 
derivatives in the presumption rule. It is clear that the terms salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of 
isomers and  complexes cover molecules that  (i) include the same chemical structure,  but bound to  a 
different  salt,  ester,  ether,  or  complex,  or  (ii)  have  the  same  atom  connectivity  but  in  a  different 
isomeric  form.  The  common  characteristic  of  all  these  forms  is  thus  that  they  contain  the  same 
structure or the same atom connectivity. 
The inclusion of the term “derivative” in this list can thus only be intended to cover chemical forms that 
also  contain  the  same  structure  or  the  same  atom  connectivity.  It  is  thus  a  residual  category  that  is 
meant  to  cover  other  chemical  forms  than  salts,  esters,  etc.  that  contain  the  same  structure  (or  the 
same  atom  connectivity).(d)  In  the  alternative,  the  chemical  similarity  must  be  sufficiently  strong  to 
justify a presumption of being the same active substance 
Subsidiarily,  even  if  it  was  admitted  that  the  term  “derivative”  be  interpreted  --  as  was  done  by  the 
CHMP and the QWP -- on the basis of a broader chemical meaning, teriflunomide would still not qualify 
as  a  derivative  of  leflunomide.  In  particular,  both the  CHMP  and  the  QWP  have  adopted  a  concept  of 
structural similarity that is so broad that it would cover many substances that are clearly not similar. 
The  threshold  for  structural  similarity  coefficients  must  be  higher  if  any  meaningful  similarity 
comparison is to be performed. 
The following definitions in reference chemistry textbooks illustrate the broad chemical meaning of the 
term derivative:

Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry 
“Derivative: A compound that is derived from some other compound and usually maintains its

added) 
These definitions have two elements in common. A derivative can be chemically derived from 
another substance, and it has a structural/chemical similarity with that substance. 
The  importance  of  the  structural  similarity  is  also  confirmed  in  the  EU  orphan  medicines  rules.  The 
relevance  of  the  criteria  laid  down  under  this  legislation  has  been  confirmed  by  the  European 
Commission,  which,  in  its  letter  of  24  January  2013  to  the  CHMP,  stated  that  the  analysis  “whether 
teriflunomide and leflunomide have the same chemical structure … should take full consideration of the 
definition  of  “similar  active  substance”  provided  for  under  Article  3(2)(c)  of  Regulation  847/2000.” 
Commission  Regulation  847/2000  defines  a  “similar  active  substance”  as  follows,  for  purposes  of  the 
orphan market exclusivity: 
“an identical active substance, or an active substance with the same principal molecular structural 
features (but not necessarily all of the same molecular structural features) and which acts via the 
same mechanism. 
This  includes:  (1)  isomers,  mixture  of  isomers,  complexes,  esters,  salts  and  non-covalent 
derivatives of the original active substance that differs from the original active substance only with 
respect to minor changes in the molecular structures, such as a structural analogue; …” (emphasis 
added) 
If similar molecular structure is needed for a derivative to be a similar active substance, it is a fortiori 
needed for it to qualify as the same active substance.

As explained above, this broad chemical approach of the term “derivative” cannot be accepted as this 
term  must  be  understood  in  the  context  of  the  enumeration  of  article  10(2)(b)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC,  which  solely  refers  to  substances  sharing  the  same  structure  (or  atom  connectivity). 
Nevertheless,  if  this  alternative  interpretation  is  accepted,  a  derivative  does  not  need  to  contain  the 
same chemical compound. The structural similarity must, however, be sufficiently clear and strong to 
justify a presumption of being the same active ingredient. There is not sufficient similarity between the 
two molecules to consider teriflunomide as a derivative of leflunomide 
1.2 Teriflunomide does not include the leflunomide molecule 
Teriflunomide  clearly  does  not  contain  the  compound  leflunomide.  It  has  an  open  chain  where 
leflunomide is a heterocyclic compound with an isoxazole ring. 
Based on the main interpretation that derivatives must contain the same structure or the same atom 
connectivity  (extended,  for  instance,  by  a  clathrate)  --  as  outlined  above  in  section  [1.1  (c)]  -- 
teriflunomide cannot be a derivative of leflunomide. The presumption rule can thus not apply, so that 
teriflunomide must be considered as a new active substance. 
This  conclusion  is  the  only  one  that  respects  the  spirit  of  article  10(2)(b)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC, 
while taking due consideration to the public health impact of the NAS assessment. 
1.3. In the alternative, there is no sufficient structural similarity between teriflunomide and leflunomide 
Teriflunomide as used in Aubagio® is not chemically derived from leflunomide. The QWP and the CHMP 
however  concluded  that  the  opening  of  the  isoxazole  ring  “is  considered  a  simple  structural 
modification  and  a  technically  simple  one-step  synthetic  transformation”.  This  statement  is  incorrect. 
To convert leflunomide chemically into teriflunomide requires a complex reaction scheme shown below 
(see Figure 16) where the isoxazole ring must first be opened in a base-catalyzed reaction to produce 
two  sequential  intermediates  to  form  the  teriflunomide  enol  which  must  be  adjacent  to  the  amide 
group. 
Figure 16 - Chemical steps required for the conversion of leflunomide into teriflunomide 
Irrespective of the production method used, it is clear that teriflunomide is structurally different from 
leflunomide.  There  is  no  close  degree  of  chemical  relationship  between  the  two  substances. 
Leflunomide  is  a  heterocyclic  compound  with  an  isoxazole  ring,  while  teriflunomide  is  an  open  chain 
compound with a keto-enol and nitrile functionalities. 
The  following  sections  demonstrate  the  major  structural  differences  between  teriflunomide  and 
leflunomide  supporting  that  teriflunomide  is  a  NAS.  Teriflunomide  should  thus  be  considered  a  new 
active substance. 
1.4. Teriflunomide is structurally different from leflunomide 
The QWP report of 15 March 2013 concluded that teriflunomide and leflunomide are structurally similar 
and  that  “considering  the  1D  descriptors  (molecular  structure,  molecular  formula,  atoms  of  carbon, 
Assessment report  
EMA/529295/2013

hydrogen and heteroatoms, relative molecular mass, functional groups, number of rings, phenyl rings, 
etc)  and  the  supportive  information  from  the  similarity  coefficients  using  different  fingerprints,  it  can 
be  concluded  that  from  a  structural  point  of  view,  the  differences  between  both  molecules  (namely, 
opening of the isoxazole ring) are minor. Both molecules are structurally similar in the context of the 
orphan drug legislation.” 
Sanofi considers that the CHMP has not sufficiently recognized the significant impact that the opening 
of  the  isoxazole  ring  of  leflunomide  has  on  the  entire  molecule  framework.  Several  external  experts 
agree with Sanofi that teriflunomide and leflunomide are clearly different chemical entities. 
Evidence of the structural differences between leflunomide and teriflunomide include the data from the 
Module  3  General  Properties  and  Elucidation  of  Structure  and  Other  Characterization)  of  each 
submission or prior response documents provided for each drug substance, namely:  
Spectroscopic properties (NMR, IR, MS and UV)  
Tanimoto coefficient, descriptors, fingerprints and formula differences Physico-chemical differences 
(Solubility, Melting Point) 
Structural Biology (conformational differences, protein binding, electrostatic interactions, molecular 
polarization,  descriptors  and  fingerprints  topological  representations  and  amide  bond  reactivity 
differences) 
Physicochemical properties 
The  information  presented  in  this  section  by  Sanofi  clearly  demonstrate  that  leflunomide  and 
teriflunomide are entirely distinct molecules with unique spectroscopic, Tanimoto, physico-chemical 
and  structural  biology  features.  These  are  significant  structural  differences  that  do  not  support  a 
finding that the two compounds are so structurally similar that they can be considered derivatives. 
It follows that teriflunomide must be considered a new active substance. 
CHMP position 
To determine whether a certain drug substance can be regarded as a New Active Substance (NAS) the 
requirements  of  Article 10(2)(b)  of  Directive 2001/83/EC  that  defines  what  can  be  considered  as  the 
same active substance have to be taken into account: 
“The different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active 
substance  shall  be  considered  to  be  the  same  active  substance,  unless  they  differ  significantly  in 
properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy”. 
Based on this provision, the Notice to Applicants (NtA, Volume 2A, Chapter 1) in Annex III provides for 
a guiding interpretation of what can be regarded as a New Active Substance: 
“A new chemical, biological or radiopharmaceutical active substance includes: 
• 
• 
a  chemical,  biological  or  radiopharmaceutical  substance  not  previously  authorised  as  a 
medicinal product in the European Union. 
an  isomer,  mixture  of  isomers,  a  complex  or  derivative  or  salt  of  a  chemical  substance 
previously  authorised  as  a  medicinal  product  in  the  European  Union  but  differing  in 
properties  with  regards  to  safety  and  efficacy  from  that  chemical  substance  previously 
authorised. 
• 
[…]”

As  stated  in  the  initial  CHMP  opinion,  from  a  chemical  point  of  view,  it  can  be  easily  concluded  that 
both, teriflunomide and leflunomide are not related as different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures 
of  isomers  or  complexes.  The  relevant  question  is,  whether  teriflunomide  and  leflunomide  can  be 
regarded as derivatives. 
As  presented  above,  the  applicant  has  provided  several  definitions  of  the  term  “derivative”  which 
reflect the vague nature of the term. E.g. the applicant avoids to emphasise the word “usually” in the 
definition cited from Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry above. However this word is important because it 
implies that there are circumstances in which the general structure of the compound is not maintained 
after derivatization.  
In fact, there are other dictionaries which do not take into consideration the structural aspect for the 
definition of derivative, for example: 
-McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms16: 
“Derivative [CHEM]: A substance that is made from another substance”. 
As the legislation does not provide a definition of the term “derivative” this has to be interpreted also 
in  light  of  its  linguistic  meaning.    Semantically,  a  “derivative”  is  something  that  is  derived  from 
something else. 
Scientific rationale for interpretation of the term “derivative” 
In order to understand the regulatory interpretation of the term “derivative” it is important to note that 
all  the  terms  in  Article  10(2)(b)  “salts,  esters,  ethers,  isomers,  mixtures  of  isomers,  complexes  or 
derivatives  of  an  active  substance”  share  a  common  denominator:  they  may  under  certain 
circumstances  expose  the  patient  to  exactly  the  same  molecule  as  an  already  approved  medicinal 
product does, as explained below: 
•  Salts usually dissociate in aqueous solution and the active part is no longer associated with the 
counter ion but is rather surrounded by solvent molecules and ions present in the solution. An 
abridged  application  may  be  based  on  another  salt  than  the  reference  product.  The  new  salt 
shall be considered to be the same active substance unless it differs significantly in properties 
with regards to safety and/or efficacy.   
• 
• 
Preparing  esters  and  ethers  of  an  original  molecule  is  a  commonly  used  method  to  prepare 
pro-drugs  intended  to  release  the  original  molecule  in  vivo.  If  justified  by  differences  with 
respect to safety and/or efficacy, they can be granted NAS status. 
Isomers should in this context be understood as enantiomers. Isomers related to each other as 
enantiomers  have  the  same  connectivity  but  are  non-superimposable  mirror  images  of  each 
other. They have the same chemical and physical properties (apart from the rotation of plane 
polarized  light),  i.e.  act  in  exactly  the  same  manner,  except  when  they  interact  with  other 
chiral structures. Whether they differ with respect to safety and/or efficacy may differ case by 
case. Enantiomers are therefore not NAS in themselves. There is a particular situation, which is 
the reason for mentioning “mixture of isomers” in Article 10(2)(b). That is where a racemate is 
the  active  substance  of  an  approved  medicinal  product  and  a  new  application  for  only  one  of 
the  two  enantiomers  is  made.  In  this  case,  the  enantiomer  represents  half  of  the  active 
content  in  the  original  product.  The  patients  are  therefore  in  both  cases  exposed  to  this 
16 ‘derivative’ 2003, in McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, USA, 
viewed 24 June 2013, <from http://www.credoreference.com/entry/mhscience/derivative>

structure.  The  enantiomer  can  get  NAS  status  provided  that  it  is  justified  by  differences  with 
respect to safety and/or efficacy. 
If this understanding of “isomer” in Article 10(2)(b) would not prevail, the consequence would 
be  that  the  NAS  status  of  teriflunomide  versus  leflunomide  must  be  assessed  based  on  their 
relationship  as  structural  isomers  (both  having  the  same  molecular  formula:  C 12H 9F3N2O2). 
Also  in  this  situation  justification  based  on  differences  with  respect  to  safety  and/or  efficacy 
would be needed. 
•  Complexes intended to release in vivo an already approved active substance that is entrapped 
by the complex would not be considered NAS, unless differences with respect to safety and/or 
efficacy are demonstrated. 
Based on this it can be concluded that derivative in the context of Article 10(2)(b) and the Annex III of 
the NtA should be primarily understood as those substances:  
a.  where the original substance in vivo will be derived from the new applied substance in such a 
manner  that  the  patients  are  exposed  to  the  original  substance  (the  applied  substance  is  a 
prodrug).  Esters  and  ethers  are  separately  mentioned  in  the  article,  but  other  kind  of  pro-
drugs are covered by the term “derivative”. 
b.  where the new applied substance is the same substance as the one the patients were exposed 
to when treated with the original substance. i.e. where the new substance is identical to what 
is in vivo derived from the original substance (the applied substance is a metabolite). 
Besides  this  primary  understanding  of  derivative,  a  secondary  understanding  has  resided  on 
whether  the  applied  molecule  can  be considered  as  a  simple  in  vitro  structural  modification  of  an 
already approved molecule. 
The active substance contained in Aubagio, teriflunomide falls under the primary understanding of the 
term derivative since it is an in vivo metabolite of leflunomide. Upon administration of leflunomide, in 
vivo,  the  isoxazole  ring  present  in  the  molecule  of  leflunomide  is  opened  and  70%  of  the  drug 
administered  converts  into  teriflunomide  (teriflunomide  is  derived  in  vivo).    Therefore,  regardless  of 
the  substance  administered  (leflunomide  or  teriflunomide)  the  patient  is  exposed  to  the  same 
molecule.  
In addition, teriflunomide also falls within the secondary understanding of the term derivative (in vitro 
derivative).  It  can  be  easily  derived  by  a  one  step  in  vitro  hydrolysis  from  leflunomide.  The  reaction 
proceeds  rapidly  and  cleanly  via  an  E 2-elimination  mechanism,  without  other  intermediates,  upon 
treatment with base at ambient temperature. This is considered a simple structural modification. The 
keto-enol  tautomerism  is  an  equilibrium  reaction  which  does  not  mean  that  the  conversion  can  be 
regarded as a complex reaction.  
Therefore,  from  a  quality  point  of  view,  the  CHMP  considers  that  teriflunomide  is  a  derivative  of  an 
already authorised active substance.    
The  interpretation  from  the  applicant  based  on  “what  is  used  in  the  medicinal  product  production” 
cannot  be  accepted  as  it  would  preclude  the  use  of  different  salts,  esters,  ethers  in  generic 
applications.  It  would  not  be  possible  to  fulfil  the  criteria  “the  same  qualitative  and  quantitative 
composition” with another salt, ester, ether, respectively. The substances will in many cases be similar 
as  they  are  present  in  the  formulation.  As  explained  above,  the  primary  understanding  of  Article 
Assessment report

Page 141/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC is that the new substance may under certain circumstances expose 
the patient to exactly the same molecule as an already approved medicinal product does. 
Even  though  Aubagio  is  not  an  orphan  medicinal  product,  in  response  to  the  applicant’s  claim  during 
the initial evaluation, the CHMP performed the structural similarity evaluation as per the orphan drug 
legislation  (Article  3(3)(b)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  847/2000).  The  CHMP  concluded  that 
considering  the  1D  descriptors  (molecular  structure,  molecular  formula,  atoms  of  carbon,  hydrogen 
and heteroatoms, relative molecular mass, functional groups, number of rings, phenyl rings, etc) and 
the supportive information from the similarity coefficients using different fingerprints, from a structural 
point  of  view,  the  differences  between  leflunomide  and  teriflunomide  molecules  (namely,  opening  of 
the isoxazole ring) are minor. Both molecules are structurally similar in the context of the orphan drug 
legislation. 
However,  such  similarity  assessment  is  not  meant  to  define  whether  an  active  substance  is  to  be 
considered new active substance or not, but only whether two active substances are to be considered 
similar within the meaning of Article 3(3)(c) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000.  
Teriflunomide  is  a  structural  analogue  of  leflunomide.  Both  molecules  share  the  same  molecular 
structure, namely the 4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl and the amide groups, and only differ on the part of 
the structure which is subject to the opening of the isoxazol ring. 
The  compounds  share  many  similarities  in  their  properties.  For  example,  both  compounds  are 
practically  insoluble  in  water  and  belong  to  the  class  II  biopharmaceutics  classification  system.  They 
are also similarly lipophilic and bioavailable. However, since leflunomide and teriflunomide are different 
chemical  entities  it  is  anticipated  that  they  might  show  some  differences  in  spectroscopic  and 
physicochemical properties. Indeed, the observed differences in some physico-chemical properties e.g. 
melting point could also be found for different polymorphs and isomers of the same active substance 
and  for  different  esters/acids.    The  aim  to  develop  pro-drugs  is  to  improve  the  physicochemical, 
biopharmaceutical or pharmacokinetic properties of pharmacologically active agents.  
Therefore  the  differences  in  physicochemical  or  spectroscopic  properties  are  acknowledged  but  could 
only  lead  to  the  conclusion  on  NAS  if  this  translates  to  an  improved  safety  and/or  efficacy  of  the 
product.    As  described  above,  the  in  vivo  transformation  of  leflunomide  into  teriflunomide  precludes 
considering  teriflunomide  as  a  NAS  unless  a  significant  difference  in  safety  and  efficacy  is 
demonstrated. 
The described differences in structural conformation between parent compound and the derivative (X-
Ray,  electron  density,  3D  molecular  representation)  may  appear  mainly  in  the  crystalline  state. 
However,  since  the  molecules  have  to  be  dissolved  before  exerting  their  biological  action,  these 
differences are not considered relevant for the performance of the product in vivo and thus for the NAS 
assessment.  
Conclusion on Chemical aspects 
Based  on  the  above,  the  CHMP  considers  that  for  the  purpose  of  assessment  of  the  NAS  status 
teriflunomide  is  a  derivative  of  leflunomide  since  it  exposes  the  patients  to  the  same  molecule  as 
treatment with leflunomide does.  
This conclusion is further emphasised by the fact that teriflunomide can be easily derived by a one step 
in-vitro  hydrolysis  from  leflunomide.  This  is  considered  a  simple  structural  modification  and  a 
technically simple one-step synthetic transformation.

II) Significant differences in safety and/or efficacy 
Applicant´s position: 
The following arguments were presented by the applicant to justify that significant differences in terms 
of safety and/or efficacy exist between teriflunomide and leflunomide. 
Considering the pharmacokinetics of teriflunomide and leflunomide, the applicant pointed at formation 
of  leflunomide-specific  metabolites  that  are  not  formed  after  teriflunomide  administration,  some  of 
which  have  a  potential  for  hepatotoxicity  based  on  in  silico  analyses.  In  particular,  the  applicant 
highlighted that approximately 30% of the leflunomide dose is converted to substances (metabolites) 
that are not observed following teriflunomide administration (fig. 17) 
Fig. 17 
In this context, the applicant highlighted that the extra step of leflunomide to teriflunomide, involving 
CYP-mediated metabolism, may increase the potential for adverse reactions due to polymorphisms and 
resulting heterogeneity in metabolism and drug interactions.  
Poor and intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizer RA patients were seen to present with lower teriflunomide 
concentration17.  
Consistently  with  this  observation,  CYP2C19  phenotype  was  also  shown  to  be  significantly  associated 
with  the  likelihood  of  treatment  cessation.  In  their  grounds  for  re-examination,  the  applicant  made  a 
specific  reference  to  a  recent  publication  by  Wiese  et  al.18,  which  investigated  the  polymorphisms  in 
cytochrome P450 2C19 enzyme and cessation of leflunomide in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Overall,  the  results  of  the  study  indicated  that  CYP2C19  phenotype  was  significantly  associated  with 
the  likelihood  of  cessation,  with  ultra-rapid  metabolizers  (UM  patients)  ceasing  less  frequently  than 
intermediate/poor  metabolizer  (IM/PM)  patients  with  RA  under  leflunomide  treatment  because  of 
adverse events (fig. 18).

status 
The  company  summarised  that  the  study  was  a  retrospective  cohort  study  with  252  RA  patients 
treated  with  leflunomide,  of  whom  78  patients  were  selected  based  on  age,  diagnosis  of  RA,  DNA 
sample availability and sufficient clinical data. Leflunomide treatment was administered in combination 
with other medicines such as methotrexate, sulfasalazin and hydroychoroquine. 
The key results are summarised in table 38 below: 
Table 38 
Of  note,  42.3%  of  patients  discontinued 
leflunomide 
treatment  due 
to  adverse  events. 
Poor/intermediate  metabolisers  discontinued  treatment  due  to  AEs  significantly  more  frequently  than 
extensive/ultra-rapid  metabolisers.  The  AEs  leading  to  discontinuations  comprised  diarrhea  (8), 
nausea/vomiting  (7),  elevated  transaminases  (6),  shortness  of  breath/cough/pneumonitis  (5), 
dizziness/fainting  (4),  rash  (3),  haematological  events  (3),  abdominal  cramps/bloating  (3),  hair  loss 
(2), fatigue (2) and other single AE causes (9). 
With  respect  to  safety,  the  applicant  referred  to  the  conclusion  of  the  authors,  i.e.  that  if    the  side 
effects from leflunomide were solely caused by teriflunomide, intermediate/poor metabolizers would be 
expected  to  have  a  lower  incidence  of  toxicity.  The  observation  of  the  IM/PM  patients  not  showing  a 
lower incidence of toxicity indicated either direct toxicity by leflunomide, or that an alternate pathway 
competes  with  the  conversion  of  leflunomide  to  teriflunomide  and  results  in  formation  of  another 
metabolite which contributes to side effects. 
As  opposed  to  leflunomide,  an  association  between  this  genetic  heterogeneity  and  teriflunomide 
adverse events is not expected, as CYP-mediated metabolism is limited in teriflunomide.

The  applicant  claimed  that  these  findings  are  clinically  relevant  in  terms  of  safety  and  drug 
interactions. 
To  put  these  findings  into  perspective  of  the  MS  setting  where  teriflunomide  was  developed,  the 
applicant  further  highlighted  that  there  is  a  number  of  concomitant  medications,  which  are  CYP2C19 
inhibitors,  frequently  used  in  RRMS  patients,  such  as  anti-depressant,  antibiotics  and  antifungals, 
NSAIDs  and  anti-convulsant,  proton-pump  inhibitors  &  H2-receptor  antagonists  and  modafinil  (table 
39). 
Table 39 Selected inhibitors of CYP2C19 (drugs highlighted in red reflect drugs in therapeutic classess 
most frequently prescribed to MS patients) 
As an additional argument, raised already in the initial MAA, the applicant pointed out that conducting 
direct comparative clinical studies purely for the reasons of substantiating the NAS would be unethical, 
specifically  highlighting  the  fact  that  exposing  RA  patients  to  teriflunomide  or  MS  patients  to 
leflunomide would not be justifiable due to expected lack of benefits of such study to patients enrolled. 
At the same time the applicant re-iterated the arguments and data presented in the initial dossier (i.e. 
non-clinical  safety  data  regarding  hepatotoxic  potential,  genotoxic/carcinogenic  potential,  cataracts, 
pancreas and inflammation and clinical pharmacology data on PK and pharmacogenomics) and claimed 
that the overall data provided form a sufficient basis for concluding that there is a significant difference 
in safety between teriflunomide and leflunomide.  
CHMP position 
The  CHMP  considered  the  arguments  presented  by  the  applicant  and  re-confirmed  their  previous 
position  that  in  order  for  teriflunomide  to  be  qualified  as  a  new  active  substance    there  should  be 
significant differences in terms of safety and/or efficacy and that these differences should be viewed as 
clinically relevant.

There  are  reported  differences  in  (non-)clinical  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicity  findings  between 
teriflunomide  and  leflunomide  (including  hepatic  profiles  in  silico  and  in  vitro,  carcinogenic, 
cataractogenic, inflammatory and  pancreatic profiles in vivo), which might well indicate that both are 
two different substances. Although it is plausible that these could translate into clinical differences, the 
CHMP maintained their previous position on interpretation of the non-clinical safety data and the need 
to further substantiate the relevance of the available evidence. 
In this regard, differences in the metabolism/PK of both teriflunomide and leflunomide in combination 
with  the  pharmacogenomics  data  were  viewed  as  potentially    translating  into  clinical  relevance.  The 
fact that up to 30% of leflunomide is converted to other metabolites not formed following teriflunomide 
administration  and  that  these  metabolites  are  not  inert  components,  but  potentially  hepatotoxic, 
and/or likely to participate in drug interactions was considered of clinical relevance. As it was the fact 
that  the  metabolism  of  leflunomide  and  teriflunomide  follow  two  different  metabolic  pathways,  with 
involvement of cytochromes to a large extent in the case of leflunomide conversion to teriflunomide. 
To  further  explore  the  relevance  of  the  differences,  the  CHMP  discussed  results  of  the  Wiese  study 
taking  into  account  its  limitations,  including  the  use  of  concomitant  medication,  selection  of  the 
patients  and  the  statistical  analysis.  It  was  reported  that  poor/  intermediate  CYP  2C19  metabolisers 
were numerically at higher risk of treatment cessation than the other subgroups due to safety reasons. 
Recognising  the  exploratory  nature  of  this  study,  its  results  were  nevertheless  considered  to  indicate 
that  the  polymorphism  related  variability  in  the  relative  transformation  of  leflunomide  into  its  active 
metabolite  teriflunomide  vs  the  alternative  non-inert  metabolites,  has  clinical  consequences,  as  the 
alternative metabolites may contribute to some adverse  drug reactions. Results were also considered 
to  indicate  that  cytochrome  involvement  in  leflunomide  metabolism  might  be  a  relevant  source  of 
drug-drug interactions.  
A  number  of  publications,  including  the  Grabar  study  presented  by  the  applicant,  suggested  that 
genetic variability in leflunomide-metabolizing enzymes influences teriflunomide concentrations, which 
was considered to give further support to the previous findings.  
Based  on  the  combination  of  the  biological  plausibility,  experimental  findings,  the    differences  in 
metabolism  pathway  of  leflunomide  vs  teriflunomide,  with  the  concept  of  different  levels  of  CYP-
mediated metabolism, and the findings in the clinical setting (i.e. retention of treatment highest in the 
UM  patients),  the  CHMP  considered  that  if  teriflunomide  is  administered,  this  variability  and  the 
potential  for  some  adverse  reaction  will  be  reduced,  leading  to  a  significant  difference  between 
leflunomide and teriflunomide safety profile.  
Conclusions on significant differences in safety and/or efficacy 
Overall, the CHMP was of the opinion that based on the totality of data described and discussed above, 
it  can  be  concluded  that  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  teriflunomide  and  leflunomide  in 
safety. 
Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
Overall,  the CHMP  was  of  the  opinion that  teriflunomide  is  a  derivative  of leflunomide,  since  the  only 
difference  between  both  molecules  is  the  opening  of  the  isoxazole  ring.  This  is  considered  to  be  a 
simple  structural  modification,  which  occurs  by  a  single  metabolic  step  in vivo  and  can  be  also 
achieved in vitro via a simple one-step synthetic transformation.  
Assessment report

However, this simple structural modification leads in vivo to a substantially different biotransformation 
profile.  For  that  reason,  based  on  the  combination  of  biological  plausibility  and  the  non-cliinical  and 
clinical evidence available, the CHMP considered that in terms of safety, there is a significant difference 
between teriflunomide and leflunomide.  
Therefore, the available underlying data to the MAA allowed concluding that teriflunomide qualifies as a 
NAS. 
Recommendations following re-examination 
Based  on  the  arguments  of  the  applicant  and  all  the  supporting  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy, 
the  CHMP  re-examined  its  initial  opinion  and  in  its  final  opinion  concluded  by  majority  decision  that 
teriflunomide  which  is  a  derivative  of  leflunomide  is  qualified  as  a  new  active  substance,  as  it  differs 
significantly in properties with regard to safety from the previously authorised substance. 
Divergent positions to the majority recommendation are appended to this report.

DIVERGENT POSITIONS 
The  undersigned  members  of  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  conclusion  that  the  active 
substance contained in Aubagio, teriflunomide, is a new active substance. 
The reasons for divergent positions were as follows: 
Teriflunomide  is  a  structurally  closely  related  in  vivo  derivative  of  leflunomide.  In  this  case,  the 
legislation 
(Art. 10(2)(b)  of  Dir. 2001/83/EC)  and 
the  pertinent  CHMP 
reflection  paper 
(EMA/651649/2010)  require  the  demonstration  of  significant  differences  with  regard  to  safety  and/or 
efficacy to consider the derivative a NAS. In this regard, the level of scientific evidence provided by the 
applicant  is  considered  to  be  insufficient  to  demonstrate  the  significant  difference  required  by  the 
legislation for the following reasons: 
•  A  relevant  difference  regarding  propensity  for  drug-drug  interactions  or  a  relevant  effect  of 
metabolizer status on efficacy or safety of leflunomide vs. teriflunomide is possible, but could not 
be definitely confirmed from the data provided   
−  The opening of the isoxazole-ring of leflunomide to form teriflunomide is catalysed by different 
isozymes of the cytochrome P450 family (CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) and deficiency in one 
of  these  enzymes  due  to  genetic  polymorphisms  or  due  to  drug/drug  interactions is  expected 
to  be  compensated  for  by  the  other  enzymes.  Interaction  studies  of  leflunomide  or 
teriflunomide  with  rifampicin  (weak  inducer  of  CYP1A2,  inducer  of  CYP2C19  und  CYP3A4)  did 
not  relevantly  affect  teriflunomide  serum  concentrations  and  did  not  indicate  any  benefit  for 
teriflunomide.  
−  About 70 % of leflunomide is transformed into teriflunomide, the remaining 30% are converted 
into  five  additional  metabolites.  It  has  not  been  established  that  these  metabolites  exert 
relevant pharmacological or even toxicological activities in vivo in both animals and humans.   
•  Results from two published studies (Grabar et al., 2009, and Wiese et al., 2012) do not sufficiently 
support the relevance of CYP2C19 metabolizer status on the safety of leflunomide vs. teriflunomide 
as  claimed  by  the  Applicant.  Deficiencies  of  these  studies  hampering  their  interpretation  include 
retrospective  design,  potential  recruitment  bias,  small  sample  size  (especially  in  important 
subgroups), limited or lack of exposure data and unclear or retrospective and selective evaluation 
of  adverse  events  based  on  patient  recollection.  In  addition,  results  regarding  the  impact  of 
metaboliser status on toxicity of leflunomide are conflicting. Information on patient characteristics, 
leflunomide  doses  or  number  and  type  of  relevant  co-medications  for  the  analysed  metaboliser 
subgroups, which could have well affected the frequency and type of adverse events, is absent and 
whilst  a  causal  effect  may  be  hypothesised,  it  cannot  be  confirmed  on  the  basis  of  the  data 
presented for assessment. Moreover, the statistical analysis in the Wiese study is considered to be 
flawed for the purpose of confirmatory inference.  Firstly, the analysis method will exaggerate the 
presented  putative  associations  because  of  the  modelling  assumptions  that  cannot  reasonably  be 
assessed  on  the  basis  of  the  small  sample  size.    Secondly,  it  has  not  been  confirmed  that  the 
analyses were pre-specified and not data-driven with consequent concerns over bias. 
• 
The  results  from  non-clinical  studies  presented  by  the  applicant  do  not  sufficiently  support  a 
clinically relevant difference in the safety profiles of leflunomide and teriflunomide.  
•  With  respect  to  hepatic  and  pancreatic  toxicity,  genotoxic/carcinogenic  potential,  and  the  risk  to 
develop cataract or chronic progressive nephropathy and amyloidosis, safety issues highlighted by

the  applicant,  differences  between  leflunomide  and  teriflunomide  were  only  detected  in  certain 
non-clinical  in silico  and  in vitro  tests  or  were  inconclusively  limited  to  single  gender,  species,  or 
even dose groups in vivo or were attributable to other circumstances (e.g. aging of the animals in 
long-term  studies).  As  these  findings  were  not  confirmed  by  other  non-clinical  in vivo 
investigations  or  by  clinical  data,  the  minor  differences  are  consequently  of  unknown  or 
questionable clinical relevance.

Currently, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (mRNA-1273.222) booster vaccination is authorised 
in individuals 12 years of age and older for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
caused by SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this submission is to request the extension of the indication to 
authorise booster vaccination in individuals 6 through 11 years of age. The proposed dosing regimen is a 
single 25 μg dose of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (12.5 μg elasomeran /12.5 μg 
davesomeran). 
On 15th December 2022, the use of a 25 µg dose Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (mRNA-
1273.214, 12.5 μg elasomeran /12.5 μg imelasomeran) was authorised as a booster dose in children 6 
through 11 years of age.  
To support this application, the MAH submitted additional clinical data from Study mRNA-1273-P205 Part 
G (mRNA-1273.214; Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 as a 2nd booster dose) compared with the 
data from Part F Cohort 2 (mRNA-1273; Spikevax original as a 2nd booster dose), including the data 
previously assessed during procedures EMEA/H/C/005791/II/75/G and EMEA/H/C/005791/II/84/G.

Supportive data from Study P205 Part H (mRNA-1273.222; Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 as 
2nd booster dose) administered in an adult population (with a follow-up duration time of 37 days) was 
previously assessed during procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/077.  
The data from Study mRNA-1273-P204 Booster Dose Phase is also supportive based on the safety and 
reactogenicity profile after administration of 25 µg of mRNA-1273 as a booster dose in children 6 through 
11 years of age, as previously evaluated during procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/83/G. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more 
severe diseases, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Coronaviruses are also zoonotic, with different 
species causing disease in other mammals, such as bats and cats. 
An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 began in Wuhan, Hubei 
Province, China in December 2019, and the disease quickly spread globally (WHO 2020). This virus is not 
known to have previously caused disease in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared 
COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30th January 2020 and a 
pandemic on 11th March 2020. 
Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via exposure to infectious respiratory fluids in 3 
principal ways: 1) inhalation of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles; 2) deposition of respiratory 
droplets and aerosol particles on mucous membranes in the mouth, nose, or eye by direct splashes 
and/or sprays; and 3) touching mucous membranes with hands that have been soiled either directly by 
respiratory fluids or indirectly by contact with fomites (CDC 2021). 
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals has also been 
documented and may account for an estimated 59% of transmission (Johansson et al 2021). 
Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever and cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
muscle aches, chills, sore throat, headache, and the distinctive symptoms of loss of taste or smell. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is constantly changing over time. After the 
onset of the Omicron wave, the demographics of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 shifted to younger 
age groups (UK Health Security Agency 2021; Abdullah et al 2022; Goga et al 2021). 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
Currently, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster vaccination is authorised for individuals 12 
years of age and older. The purpose of this submission is to request an age extension to the current 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 indication to support the use of a booster in individuals 6 
through 11 years of age for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-
CoV-2. 
The intended indication is the following: Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is indicated for active 
immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 6 years of age and older who 
have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19.

2.1.2.  About the product 
The MAH is using its mRNA-based platform to develop mRNA-1273, a novel, lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-
encapsulated, mRNA-based vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-
2). The proprietary LNPs encapsulating the mRNA increase its delivery efficiency and improve vaccine 
tolerability. 
Prior to the emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the MAH had developed an understanding 
of mRNA vaccine approaches against coronavirus based on prior experience in the development of mRNA 
vaccines against MERS-CoV. This preclinical effort led to the evaluation of several mRNA vaccine designs 
against MERS-CoV, the most effective of which were spike (S) protein designs. Of these, a full-length 
spike protein modified to introduce 2 proline residues to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion 
conformation (S-2P) showed improved performance versus the wild-type spike protein. These 
improvements included better expression of protein, stabilisation of the spike protein in the prefusion 
conformation, and improved immunogenicity in murine studies. 
The coronavirus spike protein mediates attachment and entry of the virus into host cells by attachment 
followed by membrane fusion, making it a primary target for neutralising antibodies (Corti et al 2015; 
Wang L 2015; Yu et al 2015; Johnson et al 2016; Chen et al 2017; Wang et al 2018; Kim et al 2019; 
Widjaja et al 2019). It has been confirmed that the stabilised SARS-CoV-2 S-2P mRNA expresses well in 
mammalian cells and is in the pre-fusion conformation (Wrapp et al 2020). 
The mRNA-1273 vaccines are delivered via IM injection, and mRNA is subsequently delivered into cells, 
primarily antigen presenting cells at the injection site and draining lymph nodes. After delivery, the mRNA 
utilises the cell’s translational machinery to produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which after proper 
assembly and processing is trafficked to the cell membrane for display to the immune system. 
mRNA-1273 stimulates innate immune responses, resulting in the production of proinflammatory 
cytokines and type 1 interferon (Nelson et al 2020). This process activates B-cell and T-cell responses 
from the adaptive immune system. mRNA-1273 directly activates B-cells, including memory B-cells, 
resulting in the secretion of antibodies that bind and neutralise SARS-CoV-2 viruses. mRNA-1273 also 
directly activates T-cells, which eliminate infected cells and support B-cell responses. mRNA-1273 induces 
Th1-biased CD4 T-cell responses (Jackson et al 2020) and antigen-specific CD8 T-cells in humans (Zhang 
et al 2022). 
To respond to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants the MAH is developing modified mRNA COVID-19 booster 
vaccines. The variant-matched bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines contain equal amounts of two mRNAs 
that encode for the Spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1) and antigenically divergent 
variants of concern, each encapsulated into individual LNPs, and co-formulated into a single drug product. 
After delivery, both mRNAs are delivered to cells in the body where the two distinct spike protomers, 
each of which represents one of the three components of the spike trimer, are expressed. After 
expression these spike protomers assemble into the spike trimer and both homotrimers as well 
heterotrimers (mixed protomers from the original spike and the variant spike) are formed. 
The inclusion of both the original and the variant spikes in the vaccine is intended to broaden immunity as 
significantly as possible. To that end, inclusion of the original spike allows reactivation and boosting of 
memory immune cell populations, increasing immunity that was previously present. In addition, inclusion 
of the variant spike, which has novel functional epitopes present primarily on the receptor-binding domain 
and the N-terminal domain, allows new naïve immune populations to be engaged and new memory 
responses to be elicited. This likely broadens immunity not only to the spike antigens delivered but likely 
also against a broader diversity of spike proteins.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek Scientific advice at the CHMP. According to the MAH, the Study P204 protocol and 
SAP have been designed in accordance with both US FDA general guidance on COVID-19 vaccine 
development (Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Food and Drug Administration, and 
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (US) 2020, 2021) and product-specific guidance. Study 
P204 protocol development, paediatric study plan, and paediatric investigation plan were discussed with 
EMA, Health Canada, and other agencies as part of the authorisation pathway developed to expedite 
regulatory approval in each country. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
• 
Overview of relevant clinical studies: 
Study mRNA-1273-P205 
Study mRNA-1273-P205 is an ongoing open-label Phase 2/3 study with multiple, sequentially enrolled 
cohorts to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of variant-targeting booster candidate vaccines. 
mRNA-1273.222 is the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster vaccine that contains 25 µg Original 
SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA and 25 µg Omicron BA.4-5 Spike mRNA. The study consists of 7 parts: A, (1, 
2), B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. 
Part F - (Cohort 2)- 50 μg of the mRNA-1273 administered as a second booster dose to adult participants 
who previously received 2 doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273 as a primary series and 1 booster dose of 50 μg 
mRNA-1273. 
Part G - Second booster dose 50 µg mRNA-1273.214: Participants who received 100 µg mRNA-1273 
primary series and a booster dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273. 
Part H - Second booster dose 50 µg mRNA-1273.222: Participants who received 100 µg mRNA-1273 
primary series and a booster dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273. 
Study mRNA-1273 P204 
Study mRNA-1273 P204 is an ongoing Phase 2/3, 3-part, dose-escalation (open-label), age de-escalation 
and randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study to evaluate the safety,

reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in children 6 months to 11 years. 
The study population was evaluated in 3 discrete age groups (6 years through 11 years, 2 years to <6 
years, and 6 months to <2 years), assessing up to 3 dosage levels (25, 50, and 100 μg) of mRNA-1273 
in the primary series. For each of the three age groups, an open-label dose-finding (Part 1) phase 
preceded a blinded, placebo-controlled (Part 2) phase which evaluated the selected dose of mRNA-1273 
in a placebo-controlled fashion. Data regarding the mRNA-1273 primary series for all age groups in P204 
has been previously submitted and primary series of 50 μg is currently authorised for use in children from 
6 through 11 years. In a subsequent amendment, the protocol was revised to offer the mRNA-1273 
primary series to P204 participants randomised to placebo once vaccination against COVID-19 was 
authorised in the respective age group. Following evidence of enhanced effectiveness of the adult booster 
dose, study P204 was amended to offer a booster dose of 25 µg mRNA-1273 to all children enrolled in the 
6 through 11 years age group, which could be administered starting 6 months post-dose 2 of the primary 
series. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Results 
The MAH submitted a second interim analysis CSR with Day 91 immunogenicity results from study mRNA-
1273-P205 part F (second booster dose with mRNA-1273) and part G (second booster dose with mRNA-
1273.214 (Original/Omicron BA.1). Immunogenicity results until Day 29 have been assessed in the 
variations EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0075/G and EMEA/H/C/005791/II/84/G. 
The MAH provided an Executive Summary on the new content: 
Intended Use 
Study mRNA-1273-P205 (Part G) demonstrated the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA 
1273.214 (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1) 1 month after administration of a 50 μg booster 
dose in participants 18 years of age and older. Building upon these data, the purpose of this document is 
to summarise 3-month antibody persistence data for mRNA-1273.214 when administered as a 50 μg 
booster dose for the prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. 
Unmet Medical Need 
Over the course of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged and are likely to continue to 
emerge, some of which have some level of escape from immunity associated with previous infection or 
vaccination. 
In November 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (BA.1) emerged with significant antigenic change 
and a growth advantage. After the emergence of the BA.1 sublineage, other Omicron sublineages (such 
as BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5) with additional antibody escape mutations have been detected in multiple 
geographies. 
The evolving antigenic variation of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the urgent need for vaccination strategies 
that induce broader protection, specifically against variants of concern with attendant risk of viral escape. 
To address the need for vaccination strategies that induce broader protection against variants of concern, 
Omicron-containing bivalent booster vaccines were authorised or approved globally for immunisation in 
the autumn of 2022. Based on the experience of mRNA-1273 and leveraging the flexible nature of the 
mRNA technology, the MAH evaluated multiple mRNA variant-targeting booster vaccines, including 
mRNA-1273.214 in study mRNA-1273-P205, to address emerging variants.

Summary of the Clinical Development Program 
The MAH has developed a portfolio of modified, bivalent booster vaccines, which contain equal amounts 
of the mRNA sequence for the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 and of a variant of concern. This 
includes mRNA-1273.214 50 μg (also referred to as “.214”), which contains 25 μg of mRNA-1273 and 25 
μg of the Omicron BA.1 spike mRNA sequence, and was evaluated in Study mRNA 1273-P205 Part G. 
In this open-label study, the safety and immunogenicity of an Omicron-containing bivalent vaccine 
(mRNA-1273.214) administered as a fourth dose (second booster after mRNA-1273 primary series and 
booster) was evaluated in comparison to mRNA-1273 booster 50 μg administered as a fourth dose 
(second booster after mRNA-1273 primary series and booster). All 437 and 376 participants in the mRNA 
1273.214 and mRNA-1273 groups, respectively, received the booster, and as of a data cut-off of 6th July 
2022, the follow-up time from the booster was ≥ 3 months for most participants (98.6%, 99.5%, 
respectively). The median follow-up time from the booster was 113 days in the mRNA-1273.214 group 
(134.32 person-years) and 127 days in the mRNA-1273 group (131.28 person-years) (Day 91 Interim 
Analysis Clinical Study Report [Part F [Cohort 2] and Part G Immunogenicity and Safety]). 
Benefit-Risk Conclusion 
Immunogenicity 
A second 50 μg booster dose of the bivalent Omicron BA.1-containing mRNA-1273.214 met all pre-
specified endpoints at Day 29 and Day 91 post-booster including superior neutralising antibody response 
against Omicron BA.1 and non-inferior response against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) (the original strain) when 
compared to the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine 1 month after administration. 
In participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: 
•  mRNA-1273.214 elicited Omicron BA.1 neutralising antibody titres (observed GMT [95% CI]) that 
were significantly higher (964.4 [834.4, 1114.7]) than those of mRNA- 1273 (624.2 [533.1,

Safety 
The safety profile of mRNA-1273.214 (median follow-up period of 113 days) was favourable and similar 
to the safety profile of mRNA-1273 (median follow-up period of 127 days). 
Conclusion 
Based on review of the effectiveness (immunogenicity) and safety data of the BA.1-containing bivalent 
booster vaccine mRNA-1273.214 50 μg, the benefit-risk profile of mRNA-1273.214 is favourable to 
support use of a bivalent booster vaccine against COVID-19 after completion of a primary series and/or 
previous booster dose with mRNA-1273 or another authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccine. 
Superiority in eliciting nAb response against Omicron BA.1 after booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 
is maintained on Day 91. Although waning is observed, GMT values on Day 91 remain above pre-booster

Design 
This is an open-label, Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the immunogenicity, 
safety, and reactogenicity of variant-targeting vaccines. This report evaluates 
the Day 91 interim immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of 50 μg of 
the Omicron BA.1-containing bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.214 when 
administered as a second booster dose to adults who previously received 2 
doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273 as a primary series. A single booster dose of 50 
μg mRNA-1273. Part F (Cohort 2) (mRNA-1273) serves as the within study, 
non-contemporaneous comparator group. The study was not designed to 
evaluate vaccine effectiveness but active surveillance for COVID-19 and 
SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed.

mRNA-1273-P205 part F Cohort 2 (second booster dose with mRNA-1273) and part G (second booster

assessed in variation EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0075/G. 
The CHMP endorsed the addition of these results to the SmPC. 
Extension of indication for mRNA-1273.222 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) to children 6 through 
11 years of age 
No new clinical study results on efficacy or immunogenicity are provided by the MAH in the current 
application for approval of mRNA-1273.222 (bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5) as a booster vaccine. 
Efficacy of mRNA-1273 as a primary series and as a booster vaccination has initially been demonstrated 
in clinical efficacy studies. Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 mRNA-1273.214 has been approved as a 
booster vaccination in adolescent and adults from 12 years of age and older based on immunogenicity 
results that support effectiveness of this bivalent vaccine. Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 mRNA-
1273.214 could demonstrate superiority as a second booster against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and non-
inferiority against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain based on nAB GMTs, compared to booster vaccination 
with mRNA-1273 (Original). 
Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 mRNA-1273.214 was thereafter approved as a booster vaccination for 
children 6 through 11 years of age based on:  
• 
• 
immunogenicity results in children 6 through 11 years of age after vaccination with mRNA-1273 
(studies P203 and P204), 
considering that immunogenicity results against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 could demonstrate 
superiority of a booster dose with mRNA-1273.214 as compared to mRNA-1273 based on GMRs in 
study P205 (EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0083/G). 
Non-clinical studies in K18-hACE2 mice demonstrated that nABs against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4-5 are 
elicited after booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.222 (EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0084/G). Based on 
immunogenicity results in children 6 through 11 years of age after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (studies 
P203 and P204, EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0083/G) and supported by non-clinical studies, it is reasonably 
likely that bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 mRNA-1273.222 will elicit a superior neutralising antibody 
response against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4-5 and a non-inferior neutralising antibody response against 
the original SARS-CoV-2 strain in children 6 through 11 years of age. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The addition of results from the second interim analysis CSR with Day 91 immunogenicity results from 
study mRNA-1273-P205 part F (second booster dose with mRNA-1273) and part G (second booster dose 
with mRNA-1273.214 (Original/Omicron BA.1) is endorsed. 
No new clinical study results on efficacy or immunogenicity are provided by the MAH in the current 
application for approval of mRNA-1273.222 (bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5) as a booster vaccine. 
Based on immunogenicity results in children 6 through 11 years of age after vaccination with mRNA-1273 
(studies P203 and P204, EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0083/G) and supported by non-clinical studies it is 
reasonably likely that bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 mRNA-1273.222 will elicit a superior neutralising 
antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4-5 and a non-inferior neutralising antibody response 
against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain in children 6 through 11 years of age. Therefore, the CHMP 
considered that the extension of the indication for mRNA-1273.222 as booster in children 6 through 11 
years of age is endorsed.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Currently, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster vaccination is authorised for individuals 12 
years of age and older. The purpose of this submission is to request an age extension to the current 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 indication to support the use of a booster in individuals 6 
through 11 years of age for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-
CoV-2. The proposed dosing regimen is a single 25 μg dose of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(12.5 μg elasomeran /12.5 μg davesomeran). 
To support this application, the MAH submitted safety data from the following studies:  
1.  Study mRNA-1273-P205 Part G and Part F. This includes safety data from participants who 
received mRNA-1273.214 (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1) as a second booster dose 
compared to safety data from participants who received mRNA-1273 as a second booster dose. 
These data was used to support the marketing authorisation of both Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 and Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 BA.4-5) in adults and 
adolescents (EMEA/H/C/005791/II/75/G and EMEA/H/C/005791/II/84/G).  
2.  Study P205 Part H (mRNA- 1273.222), with safety data for the bivalent 50 μg mRNA-
1273.222 vaccine given as a second booster dose in adults (EMEA/H/C/005791/REC/077). 
3.  Study mRNA-1273-P204, the same safety data used to support the marketing authorisation of 
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 in individuals 6 through 11 years of age 
(EMEA/H/C/005791/II/83/G).  
1.  Study mRNA-1273-P205 Part G and Part F 
Participant exposure and follow-up 
In part G, there were 437 participants who received mRNA-1273.214 (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.1) and the median duration of follow-up after booster dose was 113 days.  
In part F (Cohort 2), there were 376 participants who received mRNA-1273 and the median duration of 
follow-up after second booster dose was 127 days.  
The CHMP noted that during procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/75/G, the safety data submitted for Study 
P205, part G had a median follow-up of 43 days and for the Part F (Cohort 2) was 57 days. As it is 
described above, there is a longer median follow-up time in this submission, respectively 113 days and 
127 days including the unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, SAEs and fatal events. None of these parts studies include 
children aged 6 through 11 years of age. 
Adverse events 
Safety assessment included the monitoring of: 
•  Solicited local and systemic ARs collected during the 7-day follow-up period after the second booster 
dose, recorded daily using an eDiary. 
•  Unsolicited AEs collected during the 28-day follow-up period after the second booster dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 17/57 
 
 
 
 
 
•  SAEs, MAAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation from study, AESIs, and pregnancies collected throughout 
this interim analysis period. 
Summary of Solicited Adverse Reactions 
Part G (mRNA-1273.214): Solicited ARs were reported for 87% of participants after booster dose. 
Solicited local ARs were reported for 79.4% participants and the most common reported were: injection 
site pain (77.3%), followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (17.4%), and injection site erythema and 
injection site swelling were each reported in less than 7% of participants (each 6.9%). Most solicited local 
ARs were Grade 1 (66.6%), Grade 2 (9.4%), and none were Grade 4. Grade 3 were reported by 3.4% 
participants with the most common reported: injection site erythema (2.1%), followed by injection site 
swelling (1.1%).  
Solicited systemic ARs were reported for 70.3% participants, with the most common reported: fatigue 
(54.9%), followed by headache (43.9%), myalgia (39.8%) and arthralgia (31.1%). Most systemic ARs 
were Grade 1 (38.2%), followed by Grade 2 (26.5%) and none were Grade 4. Grade 3 were reported by 
5.5% participants with the most common reported: fatigue (3.4%) followed by myalgia (2.3%). 
Part F Cohort 2 (mRNA-1273): Solicited ARs were reported for 85.7% participants after the booster 
dose. Solicited local ARs were reported for 79.4% participants and the most common reported were: 
injection site pain (76.6%), followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (15.1%) and injection site 
erythema and injection site swelling were each reported in less than 7% of participants (respectively 
3.7% and 6.3%). Most solicited local ARs were Grade 1 (68.3%) followed by Grade 2 (7.7%), and none 
were Grade 4. Grade 3 local ARs were reported for 3.4 % participants and the most commonly reported 
were: injection site swelling (1.4%) followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (1.1%) and injection site 
pain (1.1%).  
Solicited systemic ARs were reported in 66.0% participants and the most reported were: fatigue (51.3%) 
followed by headache (41.0%), myalgia (38.4%), and arthralgia (31.5%). Most solicited systemic ARs 
were Grade 1 (35.4%) followed by Grade 2 (26.0%) and none were Grade 4. Grade 3 systemic ARs were 
reported for 4.6% participants, with the most reported: myalgia (3.7%) followed by fatigue (3.2%).  
The CHMP noted that solicited local and systemic adverse events in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster 
dose group (Part G) and the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F) respectively have been 
assessed and discussed in details in two previous procedures, respectively during the assessment process 
on booster indication of bivalent vaccines in individuals 12 years of age and older 
(EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0075/G and EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0084/G respectively).  
It has been concluded that slightly higher incidences of local and systemic adverse events were observed, 
when comparing mRNA-1273.214 50 μg administered as second booster to mRNA-1273 50 μg given as a 
booster dose. However, these differences were not clinically meaningful and were not considered to have 
a significant impact on the safety profile of mRNA-1273.214 when compared to that of mRNA-1273. 
Solicited AEs by Day of Onset  
Most solicited ARs were reported with onset from Days 1-3 after the booster dose.  
mRNA-1273.214: Among local ARs, the most frequently reported was pain, mostly with onset on Day 2, 
reported by 68.2% participants followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (onset on Day 2), reported by 
9.4% participants. Among systemic ARs was fatigue (44.4%) followed by headache (31.4%). The most 
common solicited local and systemic ARs reported within 30 minutes were: pain (6.6%), fatigue and

headache (2.1% each); axillary swelling or tenderness (1.6%); myalgia and arthralgia (0.9% each); 
nausea/vomiting and chills (0.5% each); and injection site erythema (0.2%). 
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): Among local ARs, the most frequently reported was pain, mostly with 
onset on Day 2, reported by 66.9 % participants followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (8.3%). 
Among systemic ARs was fatigue (39.5%) followed by myalgia (30.4%) and headache (29.5%). The most 
common solicited local and systemic ARs reported within 30 mins were: pain (7.1%); headache (2.9%); 
fatigue (2.6%) and axillary swelling or tenderness (2.0%).  
Solicited AEs by Duration  
mRNA-1273.214: The median duration of local and systemic ARs was 2.0 days. The most reported of 
solicited local AR was pain with median duration of 2 days, followed by swelling or tenderness (1 day). 
Among solicited systemic AR the most frequently reported were fatigue and headache with the median 
duration 2.0 and 1.0 days. The maximum duration was reported for fatigue with 21 days.  
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): The median duration of local and systemic ARs was 2.0 days. The most 
reported of solicited local AR was pain (2 days), followed by swelling or tenderness (1 day). Among 
solicited systemic AR the most frequently reported were fatigue and headache with the median duration 
2.0 and 1.0 days. The maximum duration was reported for fatigue with 13 days.  
Subgroup Analyses  
Baseline SARS-CoV-2 Status 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): In the solicited Safety Set there were 22% participants had a positive pre 
booster status; 77.8% had a negative status and 1 participant had missing status. The frequency of 
solicited local ARs was comparable between the two groups, respectively positive vs negative status 
(77.1% vs 80.0%). The same applies for the solicited systemic ARs between the two groups (66.5% vs 
71.8%).  
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): There were 26.2% participants with positive pre booster SARS-CoV-2 
status; 71.2% had a negative status and for 8 participants the status was missing. The frequency of 
solicited local ARs was comparable between the two groups, respectively positive vs negative status 
(78.3% vs 80%). The same applies for the solicited systemic ARs between the two groups (60.9% vs 
68.4%).  
Solicited AEs by Age Group 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): Higher frequency of solicited local ARs in participants ≥ 18 to < 65 years of 
age (89.4%) compared to the age group ≥ 65 years (64.4%). Similarity applies for the solicited systemic 
ARs, respectively (74.9 % vs 63.2%).  
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): Higher frequency of solicited local ARs in participants ≥ 18 to < 65 
years of age (85.2%) compared to the age group ≥ 65 years (70.7%). Similarity applies for the solicited 
systemic ARs, respectively (70.5% vs 59.3%).  
More details are provided in the Table 3 below, comparing the subgroups and the two respective parts:

The CHMP noted that no clinically meaningful imbalances were seen in subgroup analyses with regards to 
the frequencies when stratifying according to, SARS-CoV -2- status and age group. No new safety 
concerns were identified by SARS-CoV-2 status after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-1273 
given as a second booster. However higher reactogenicity was observed among participants ≥ 18 to < 65 
years of age than among those ≥ 65 years of age for both booster groups (i.e. after mRNA-1273.214 or 
mRNA-1273 given as a second booster). 
Medication Use for AEs of Pain and Fever  
The table below summarises the use of medication for pain and fever accordingly by groups. 
Table 4 - Summary of Medications for Pain/Fever After the Injection Overall and by Age Group 
– Second Booster Dose: mRNA-1273.214, mRNA-1273 (Solicited Safety Set) 
The CHMP noted that in both parts, approximately one- third of participants reported use of 
medication for pain and fever, as reported in the eDiary. In the table above, describing the incidence of 
participants taking these medications and by age group classification, it is observed that in the age group 
>=18 and <65 Years, the incidence is slightly higher in the mRNA-1273.214 group compared to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 21/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mRNA-1273 group, respectively (36.1% vs 29.1%). The opposite applies for the age group >=65 Years 
(26.4% vs 28.6%). The CHMP did not consider these minor differences to be clinically meaningful. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): Within 28 days, unsolicited TEAEs were reported for 19.2% participants, of 
these 4.8% were reported to be related to study vaccine. Up to the data cut-off, there were reported 
47.8% TEAEs and no additional TEAEs were considered to be related to study vaccine.  
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): Within 28 days, unsolicited TEAEs were reported for 21.3% participants 
and of those for 5.6% participants were considered by the investigator to be vaccine related. Up to the 
data cut-off, there were reported 52.1% TEAEs and no additional TEAEs were considered to be related to 
study vaccine.  
The table below is a summary of the TEAEs regardless of relationship to study vaccination and those 
considered related to study vaccination.

Page 22/57 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP noted that the incidences of unsolicited TEAEs regardless of relationship to study vaccination 
and those related to study vaccination were comparable between the two parts after the booster dose. 
Also, no clinical meaningful differences were noted between the age groups in the two parts as follows: 
>=18 and <65 Years: In part G (after booster dose mRNA-1273.214) unsolicited TEAEs related to study 
vaccine were 5.7% vs 4.9% in part F (after booster dose mRNA-1273); age group >=65 Years, 
respectively 3.4% vs 6.7%. 
Unsolicited AEs by SOC and PT 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): Up to 28 days after booster the most frequently reported unsolicited TEAEs 
by PT regardless of causality were fatigue (2.5%), arthralgia (1.6%), followed by headache (1.4%) and at 
least COVID-19 infection (1.1%). By SOC the most frequently reported were: Infections and infestations 
(6.6%), followed by general disorders and administration site conditions (4.1%) and musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (3%). 
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): Up to 28 days after booster the most frequently reported unsolicited 
TEAEs by PT regardless of causality were: fatigue (2.9%), upper RTI (2.4%), arthralgia and coronavirus 
infection (2.1% each); myalgia (1.6%); and headache (1.1%). By SOC the most frequently reported 
were: Infections and infestations (9.0%), followed by general disorders and administration site conditions 
(4.3%) and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (3.5%).  
Unsolicited AEs reported as severe 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): Up to 28 days after the booster, severe TEAEs were reported for 0.9% 
participants; 1 participant had fatigue with duration (Day 1-14) as vaccine related. The other 3 TEAEs 
were considered not related to study IP were:  
• 
cataract (bilateral; onset on Day 5, resolved on Day 73 for the right eye and ongoing at data cut-
off for the left eye) 
•  Barrett’s esophagus (onset Day 23 and ongoing as of data cut-off) 
• 
traumatic fracture (Day 14 to 113) 
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): Up to 28 days after the booster, severe TEAEs were reported for 0.8% 
participants. The events reported were:  
• 
• 
• 
related event of fatigue with duration from Days 2- 8.  
related event of myalgia from Day 7- 8.  
unrelated event of spinal osteoarthritis from Days 9-49.  
The CHMP noted that there were no imbalances reported after the booster dose for both parts with 
regards to the severe TEAEs, with comparable incidences (0.9% vs 0.8%). Fatigue is a known adverse 
drug reaction and is included in the section 4.8 of the SmPC, therefore no additional clinical information is 
requested with regards to the severe event of fatigue with duration from Day 1-14 in the mRNA-1273.214 
booster group. 
Unsolicited AEs considered vaccine related 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): Unsolicited TEAEs considered vaccine related were reported for 4.8% 
participants. By preferred PTs the frequently reported were: injection site erythema, injection site 
lymphadenopathy, urticaria, and dermatitis (each in one participant). The solicited ARs persisted beyond 
Day 7 and considered related to study vaccine were: fatigue (n=9), arthralgia (n=6), headache (n=5), 
myalgia (n=3) and injection site pain (n=3). Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The event of 
severe fatigue is described at the section of the severe events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 23/57 
 
 
 
 
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): Unsolicited TEAEs considered vaccine related considered vaccine 
related were reported for 5.6% participants. Events PTs reported were: injection site lymphadenopathy 
(n=1), induration (n=1), injection site bruising and nodule (occurring in the same participant), and 
urticaria (n =1). The solicited ARs beyond Day 7 considered vaccine related were: fatigue (n=10), 
arthralgia (n=6), myalgia (n=6), headache (n=3) and injection site pain (n=1). The events of fatigue; 
myalgia and hypertension are described in the respective sections.  
The CHMP noted that there were slight differences with regards to the TEAEs considered vaccine related 
between the two parts, with a slightly lower incidence in the mRNA-1273.214 booster dose group 
compared to the mRNA-1273 group, respectively 4.8% vs 5.6%. The AEs persisted beyond Day 7 are 
related with the known reactogenicity of mRNA-1273 and all the events considered as vaccine related are 
already included as ADRs at the Section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Deaths  
There were three fatal events reported in total up to data cut-off as follows:  
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): There are two deaths reported after the data cut-off.  
•  Death (verbatim term: death unknown causes): A 60-69 year old female participant with a 
medical history of Raynaud's syndrome, COPD, depression, and iron deficiency died due to 
unknown causes on Day 148 after the booster dose (mRNA-1273.214). According to the safety 
database, the study site was unable to reach the family despite multiple attempts and medical 
records could not be obtained. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. One other unsolicited 
AE, fatigue, was reported for this participant. The event was assessed as unrelated to vaccine by 
the investigator and MAH due to the long latency, but the lack of additional information limits the 
final assessment. 
The CHMP noted that the participant received a second booster dose of 50 μg mRNA-1273.214. The 
participant’s pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status was positive. The medical history included these diagnoses: 
depression, post-menopausal, intermittent headaches, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
iron deficiency and Raynaud’s syndrome. Ongoing medications reported 30 days prior to the fatal event 
were acetaminophen and albuterol. After 147 days, the participant died due to unknown causes. As 
stated above, the event was considered not to be related to the study vaccine by the investigator and the 
MAH. However, due to the lack of any clinical information and not any autopsy results, reasonably likely 
causality cannot be inferred. 
•  Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: A 60-69 year old male participant with morbid 
obesity, hypertension, and chronic peripheral oedema (water retention –in legs and feet) called 
EMS because of shortness of breath approximately 4.5 months after the booster dose, having 
experienced a cardiac arrest with secondary diagnosis of acidosis, respiratory arrest, and septic 
shock. After defibrillation, CPR was initiated. The participant was transported to the hospital, 
where return of circulation was achieved but was unable to be maintained despite continuing CPR, 
pressors and bicarbonate drip. A fatal myocardial infarction was diagnosed. An autopsy was 
performed, and the cause of death was reported as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with 
obesity as a significant contributing factor. The fatal event was considered unrelated to the study 
vaccine by the investigator and MAH and was attributed to underlying disease. 
The CHMP noted that the participant received 50 μg mRNA-1273.214 as a second booster dose. Pre-
booster SARS-CoV-2 status was negative. Medical history included: tibia fracture and tibia reconstruction; 
vasectomy; hand injury and hand crush amputation; hypertension; hypothyroidism; water retention (legs 
and feet) due to side effect of lisinopril and sensory neuropathy in hands. There is a list of many 
medications including as most relevant: lisinopril, levothyroxine, hydrocodone APAP, morphine sulfate, 
hydralazine HCl, famotidine, heparin (2000 units/1000 mL normal saline) etc. A SAE of nephrolithiasis

(kidney stones) occurred on Study Day 44, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a stone in the 
ureter and one stone in the kidney. The participant was hospitalised, underwent a left retrograde 
pyelogram but attempts to extract the kidney stone were unsuccessful. Antibiotics were given for kidney 
infection and the participant was discharged. After that, the participant returned to the hospital due to 
worsening flank pain, urinary tract infection (UTI) was confirmed, elevated blood pressure (183/102 
mmHg) as likely secondary to pain was reported. Treatment included: ketorolac tromethamine IM; 
ceftriaxone IV and hydralazine IV and the catheter was replaced with an internal ureteral stent. The 
laboratory tests showed alteration in blood tests parameters such as increase of granulocyte, decrease of 
lymphocytes, low haematocrit, BUN 48 mg/dl, creatine 5.6 mg/dL, low GFR (37 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 
elevated transaminases. The participant was discharged again, while on (Study Day 131) reported 
shortening of breath, emergent department performed defibrillation and intubation to the participant, 
EKG showed ST abnormality, likely myocardial infarction; B-type natriuretic peptide was high at 233 
pg/mL (15-100). Dead was announced, but the event was announced after the database lock, therefore 
was not included in the clinical database. Autopsy results reported as cause of death atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease, with obesity as a secondary contributing factor. The CHMP supported the 
conclusion that the event was not related to the study vaccine but more likely due to underlying disease. 
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): One death was reported as of data cut-off date, as follows:  
•  Hypotension: A ≥70 year old female participant with known coronary artery disease, 
hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia and a history of palpitations presented with sepsis and 
hypotension on Day 64 following an elective diagnostic catheterisation procedure conducted on 
Day 59 after the booster dose (mRNA-1273). The participant died on Day 64, reportedly due to 
these events. The participant had an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection on Day 29 after the 
booster dose. No autopsy was performed. No death certificate or medical records could be 
obtained at the time of this report. The investigator and MAH considered the event to be 
unrelated to the study vaccine. 
The CHMP noted that the participant received the 50 μg mRNA-1273 booster dose. Pre-booster SARS-
CoV-2 status was positive. The participant had a medical history as mentioned above and ongoing 
medications (aspirin, amlodipine, atorvastatin, nitroglycerin, and lisinopril). Unsolicited AEs of 
asymptomatic COVID-19 was reported 28 days after the dose was received. Less than two months after 
the booster dose the participant experienced chest pain and palpitations, was admitted to the hospital 
and underwent to catheterisation procedure which might have led to the SAE of Sepsis. After 5 days the 
participant experienced hypotension and reportedly died due to the events of sepsis and hypotension. As 
mentioned above there was no autopsy performed. The CHMP supported the conclusion to consider these 
events as not related to the study IP (sepsis likely due to the diagnostic procedure) and considering the 
atherosclerotic diseases as an underlying risk condition. 
Other Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
SAEs were reported in less than 3% participants in both groups, and they were considered not to be 
related to the study vaccine as follows: 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): Serious TEAEs were reported for 8/437 participants (1.8%) up to data cut-
off, of them there were two participants who had SAEs within 28 days (prostate cancer and traumatic 
fracture). These two events were considered not to be related to study vaccine. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the two SAEs of prostate cancer/ prostate cancer metastatic and the 
event of traumatic fracture are considered not related to the study IP, by considering these diagnoses and 
the medical history of the participants. 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 25/57 
 
 
 
 
SAEs captured in SMQs included one case of ischemic cerebral infarction and one case of coronary 
artery disease described as follows: 
Ischemic cerebral infarction: A ≥70 year old male participant received the booster dose of 50 μg 
mRNA-1273.214. A relevant medical history included hyperlipidemia and hypertension and ongoing 
medications with anti-hypertensive medications, anti-allergic and antibiotics. On Study Day 76 developed 
peripheral vision loss, headache, and light headedness. Participant was hospitalised and based on the 
findings of CT and MRI of the head it was diagnosed with Ischemic cerebral infarction (ischemic infarct 
right occipital). The event was ongoing at the time of data cut-off but was subsequently reported as 
resolved with sequelae of residual left visual field deficit. The event was reported as an AESI and was 
considered by the investigator and MAH to be unrelated to the study vaccine and more likely due to 
underlying disease.  
The investigator and the MAH judged the event not to be related to the study IP, considering also the fact 
that the participant was on treatment with celecoxib at the time of the event, which has a known 
association with thromboembolic disease. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
Coronary artery disease: A ≥70 year old male participant with history of tobacco use and a medical 
history of COPD, hypothyroidism, and hypercholesterolemia underwent cardiac catheterisation and was 
diagnosed with coronary artery disease on Day 78 after the booster. The participant underwent a 
coronary artery bypass graft, and the event was reported as resolved with sequelae (continuing 
medication) on Day 118. The event was considered by the investigator and MAH to be unrelated to the 
study vaccine, most likely due to underlying atherosclerotic disease. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
 mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): SAEs were reported for 10/376 participants (2.7%) up to data cut-off. 
•  One unrelated event of spinal osteoarthritis within 28 days.  
SAEs captured in SMQs included two SAEs as follows:  
•  Atrial fibrillation (SMQ: cardiac arrhythmia) A 60-69 year old female participant with medical 
history including morbid obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperthyroidism, and 
obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, and atrial fibrillation experienced atrial fibrillation (worsening 
atrial fibrillation) on Day 97 that resolved on Day 121. The event was considered by the 
investigator and MAH to be unrelated to the study vaccine. This is agreed by the CHMP, the event 
is likely due to the underlying diseases including participant’s past medical history of atrial 
fibrillation. 
•  Syncope (SMQ: cardiomyopathy): A ≥70 year old male participant with medical history of 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, osteoarthritis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and erectile 
dysfunction who was taking lisinopril, sildenafil, finasteride, ezetimibe/simvastatin, and diclofenac 
gel experienced syncope on Day 95 and was hospitalised after a head strike. Results of CT, MRI, 
and ultrasound were normal. The participant was discharged to home after 2 days, and the event 
resolved on Day 97. No final diagnosis was provided; the participant received no treatment. The 
event was considered by the investigator and MAH to be unrelated to the study vaccine. This is 
agreed by the CHMP, considering the medical history and ongoing treatment such as lisinopril and 
sildenafil which may interact due to vasodilation and could be confounders for the syncope event.  
Analyses of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
A priority list of AESIs that may be related to COVID-19 was developed by the Brighton Collaboration 
(Law 2020) has been used for the study. In addition to other AESIs, investigators were to report all 
suspected cases of probable and confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis regardless of 
whether they met the CDC case definition (Gargano et al 2021). An independent CEAC was available to 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 26/57 
 
 
 
 
assess any relevant events to determine whether they met the CDC criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” 
myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis.  
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): AESIs were reported for 1.6% participants up to data cut-off and none 
within 28 days. The events considered all unrelated were as follows: ageusia (n=4), anosmia (n=3) and 
cerebral small vessel, ischemic disease, ischemic cerebral infarction, and atrial fibrillation (in one 
participant each).  
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): AESIs were reported for 0.8 % participants up to data cut-off. The 
events were: augesia and anosmia (in a single participant), supraventricular tachycardia (n=1, within 28 
days) and tachycardia (n=1).  
Anaphylaxis/ Hypersensitivity  
No events of anaphylaxis were reported within 28 days after the booster for both groups.  
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): Two events considered related to the study vaccine; A 60-69 year old male 
participant experienced urticaria on Study Day 2 reported as resolved without treatment nearly on month 
later. An event of dermatitis (unspecified type) in a 50-59 year old female participant on Day 7 and 
resolved within 2 weeks and treatment included dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine hydrochloride.  
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): An event of urticaria (bilateral upper arms hives) in a 50-59 year old 
female participant, on Day 1 and resolved within the same day, treatment included diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride and the event was considered as not related; a related urticaria event (generalised 
urticaria) started and resolved among Days 18-22. The CHMP noted that urticaria is included in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. The event of dermatitis was reported as unspecified type and reported resolved within 2 
weeks. The event of dermatitis could be considered covered by the broad term of ‘Rash’ and due to the 
fact that it was considered as unspecified type, follow-up information is not required at this point.  
Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
No events of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported in both booster dose groups. The additional review 
done for the unrecognised cases did not reveal any new cases.  
CNS Vascular Disorders: No events of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or transient 
ischemic attack were reported for both groups. The SAE of ischemic cerebral infarction is described in the 
SAEs section. One non SAE of cerebral small vessel reported in a 60-69 year old female participant in the 
mRNA-1273.214 booster group (medical history included: obesity, hypertension, and tobacco use), 
considered as unrelated to the study IP.  
Arthritis 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): There were mostly arthralgia events, considered to be related to the study 
vaccine and occurred within 28 days. Others included: joint swelling, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid 
arthritis (bilateral hands, onset on Day 27), none considered related to the study IP.  
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): Apart the arthralgia events there was one event of worsening lumbar 
osteoarthritis, and considered as unrelated by the investigator.  
The CHMP noted that arthralgia is a known ADR of the original Spikevax and the bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine applied as booster dose and is already included in the section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: No new safety concerns in both groups.  
Neurologic SMQs: No safety concerns in both groups. 
Ageusia and Anosmia:  
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 27/57 
 
 
 
 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): Up to data cut-off there were reported (0.9%) Ageusia and (0.7%) 
Anosmia, considered unrelated to study vaccine by the investigator.  
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): Up to data cut-off there were reported (0.3%) for ageusia and 
anosmia, considered as unrelated to study vaccine.  
The CHMP did not identify any concerns between the two parts with regards to the ageusia and anosmia 
events, the participants had concurrent COVID-19.  
Hematopoietic Cytopenias: No new safety concerns in both groups.  
Medically Attended Adverse Events (MAAEs) 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G): Within 28 days after second booster dose, MAAEs were reported for 
(11.7%) participants, and MAAEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to study vaccine 
were reported for 2 participants (0.5%) as follows:  
• 
• 
dermatitis (described in the Hypersensitivity section). 
fatigue, solicited AR, with onset on Day 2 and resolved on Day 13.  
Up to data cut-off MAAEs were reported for 39.1% participants with the most commonly reported: 
COVID-19 (9.0%), upper RTI (3.9%) and rhinovirus infection (2.3%), considered as unrelated to the 
study vaccine.  
mRNA-1273 (Part F Cohort 2): Within 28 days after second booster dose, MAAES were reported for 
15.2% participants and the one considered related to the study IP were reported for 2 participants 
(0.5%): Hypertension and urticaria (the events are described in the respective section of the AR). Up to 
data cut-off, MAAEs were reported for 47.9% participants, with the most common reported: COVID-19 
(9.0%), upper RTI (5.6%), coronavirus infection (3.7%), hypertension (2.7%), rhinovirus infection 
(2.4%), and urinary tract infection (2.1%). The most commonly reported were in the infections and 
infestations SOC (29.0%). No MAAEs that occurred beyond 28 days were considered by the investigator 
to be related to study vaccine. 
More details with regards to the MAAEs for the two parts are summarised in the Table 6 below:

and Preferred Term up to the Data Cut-off Date — 2nd Booster Dose: mRNA-1273.214, mRNA-
1273 Safety Set 
The CHMP noted that with regards to the MAAEs (related and unrelated to vaccination), there were no 
safety signals identified for both two parts. The incidence of MAAEs after the second booster dose of 
mRNA-1273.214 (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1) was lower compared to the incidence of 
MAAEs after the second booster dose with the original Spikevax (mRNA-1273), respectively 39.1% vs 
47.9%. The same applies for the SOCs accordingly 23.8% vs 29.0%, and no significant imbalances were 
observed for the PT events between the two groups.

Laboratory findings 
No laboratory evaluation has been performed in the trial. No clinical concerns arose from review of vital 
signs data.  
Safety in special populations 
No special population has been included in the trial. 
Pregnancies 
No pregnancies were reported at the time of the data cut-off. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions and other interactions are not part of the scope of this trial. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no unsolicited AEs leading to discontinuation from study vaccine or study participation within 
28 days or up to the data cut-off date, in both parts of the study.  
2.  Study P205 Part H (mRNA- 1273.222) 
In the part H, Study P205, have been enrolled 511 participants, the median interval between the first 
booster dose of 50 μg mRNA-1273 and the 50 μg mRNA 1273.222 dose was 289 days and the median 
follow-up duration after the mRNA-1273.222 booster dose was 37 days. Participants age group was 18 
years of age and older. The Table 7 below summarises the solicited local and systemic ARs:

The CHMP noted that the safety data was evaluated during EMEA/H/C/005791/077 and a summary is 
provided as follows: after the 2nd booster dose of 50 μg mRNA 1273.222 the following was reported: any 
solicited adverse reactions by 87.2% participants; local ARs (82.8%) with pain as most common 
(82.4%); systemic ARs (73.2%) with fatigue as most common (59.8%). No clinically meaningful

imbalances were seen in subgroup analyses with regards to the frequencies when stratifying according to 
the age group: Solicited ARs were more reported in the ≥18 to <65 years age group (89.8%) compared 
to the ≥65 years age group with (77.1%). Mostly of the events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 and Grade 3 
accordingly (12.2% versus 9.5%). No grade 4 were reported. Unsolicited AEs considered vaccine related 
were reported by 7.8% participants, MAAEs reported by 13.7 % participants and none considered to be 
related to the Study IP. There was one death: Subarachnoid haemorrhage reported in a ≥70 year old 
male participant, assessed as not related to the vaccine due to the participants underlying disease and 
medications. There were four SAEs reported in 3 participants: the fatal event of Subarachnoid 
haemorrhage; events of anginal equivalent and syncope and one event of anaemia, considered as 
unrelated to the vaccination.  
No events of potential myocarditis or pericarditis were identified with the CMQ for participants in the 
mRNA-1273.222 50 μg (Part H). From the post-marketing experience there was one reported case of 
‘unassessable’ pericarditis due to important missing information.  
Overall, the CHMP considered that the review of the clinical safety data of mRNA-1273.222 showed that 
the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster vaccine is favourable for 
individuals 12 years of age and older. 
Post-marketing experience 
Spikevax Bivalent .222 (Original/BA.4/5) received an emergency use authorisation in the US for use as a 
booster dose in individuals 18 years of age and older on 31st August 2022. In Europe, Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 received CHMP authorisation to be administered as a booster dose for adults and 
children from 12 years of age who have already had a primary vaccination course against COVID-19 on 
19th October 2022. During procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/077, the following post-marketing experience 
with Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 was provided: Cumulatively as of 18th October 2022, 677 
cases (1,922 events) were reported to the MAH, of those 376 cases were medically confirmed, 37 cases 
(69 events) were serious, and 2 cases were reported with a fatal outcome. The mean age was 60.3 years 
and the most of the cases were reported in females (43.6%) compared to males (27.0%), and (29.4%) 
cases had missing sex information. The majority of cases were non-serious (94.5%). Cumulatively, the 
most frequently reported clinical events associated with mRNA-1273.222 booster included pyrexia 
(2.7%), fatigue (2.3%), vaccination site pain (2.3%), chills (2.2%), and pain in extremity (2.2%). Events 
coded as “No adverse event” (18.0%) were often associated with events involving product administration 
errors (eg, accidental underdose (9.4%), wrong product administered (2.2%), etc. The 2 events (0.1%) 
with a reported fatal outcome, were one case of unknown death cause in a female participant and the 
second fatal case was reported in a male participant with underlying diseases including blood clot 
problems. With regards to myocarditis and pericarditis cases there was one reported pericarditis case 
concerning a male of unknown age who had a family history of atrial fibrillation and heart rate increased. 
According to the WHO-UMC standardised case causality assessment (WHO 2013), this case was assessed 
as “unassessable” due to important missing information including exposure information, time to onset, 
laboratory values, medical history and clinical course. 
3.  Study mRNA-1273-P204 
The safety data used to support the marketing authorisation of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
in individuals 6 through 11 years of age has been assessed during EMEA/H/C/005791/II/83/G and are not 
repeated here. However, in response to request for supplementary information during this procedure, the 
MAH submitted the following information:  
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 33/57 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Booster safety data from P203 12-17yo with 6 months of safety follow-up on at least 1000 
boosted participants can be provided in the form of a CSR in May 2023. 
• 
Longer term safety data for a booster dose in 6 through 11 years of age (6 months of safety 
follow-up on at least 1000 boosted participants) is anticipated to be available at the end of 2023. 
As participants in P204 are still being boosted currently, the proposed timing is tentative. 
Solicited Local Adverse Reactions (ARs) 
The incidences of any local solicited ARs were similar across all of the age groups, from 87.3% to 92.1%. 
Most of the events were Grade 1 and Grade 2; the 6 through 11 years of age group tended to have more 
Grade 2 events than the other groups. Grade 3 events occurred less frequently, and more frequently after 
a 100 μg booster dose than a 50 μg booster dose; no trends were identified across the age ranges. There 
were no Grade 4 solicited local ARs. The most commonly reported solicited local AR was pain, with a 
similar incidence across age ranges (86.1% to 91.7%). This was followed by axillary swelling or 
tenderness (21.3% to 28.0%), which tended to occur more commonly in the two younger age groups, 
including Grade 3 events which were not reported in the adult groups. Overall, no major differences in 
local reactogenicity were noted across the age groups.

Table 8 – Frequency of solicited local adverse reactions 
Solicited Systemic Adverse Reactions 
The incidence of solicited systemic ARs was similar across the 3 older age groups (74.7% to 
76.6%) in contrast to children (6 through 11 years of age group) in which the overall rate was 64.3%. 
Rates of solicited systemic ARs were the lowest in all categories in the 6 through 11 years of age group 
except for fever where children had the highest rate (8.5%), including one Grade 4 event. Fever was 
least common in the mRNA-1273.214 group (3.4%). Children (6 through 11 years of age group) 
generally experienced lower incidence rates than the older 3 age groups for the solicited systemic ARs of 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023

headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and chills with absolute differences of 10 to 20%. Systemic 
reactogenicity tended to be lower in the mRNA-1273.214 group compared to the adolescent and adult 
mRNA-1273 groups in the events of fever, headache, nausea/vomiting, and chills. 
Across the groups the incidence of Grade 3 systemic ARs ranged from 6.0% to 8.2%, with children (6 
through 11 years of age group) having the lowest overall incidence and adolescents having the highest. 
As reporting rates were low for individual event terms, differences across the groups were not notable. 
The largest difference was for myalgia, where children (6 through 11 years of age) had Grade 3 ARs in 
1.9% whereas the other age groups had Grade 3 events in 3.4% to 3.8% of participants. 
Overall, while children (6 through 11 years of age group) tended to demonstrate less systemic 
reactogenicity than older age groups with the exception of fever, there were no findings concerning for 
overall tolerability in any of the treatment groups.

Unsolicited Adverse Events 
Common unsolicited events (occurring in ≥1% in any group) are presented in the table below. In study 
P205, subgroup analysis was not performed for unsolicited AEs, therefore the data is comprised of all 
adults in the cohort. 
The incidences of unsolicited AEs were similar across age groups with the exception of the P201 group 
where event rates were lower than the other 3 groups (7.3% vs. 13.1% to 18.5%). 
The size of the treatment group for P201 was also notably smaller than the other groups. Most of the 
events reported within 28 days after booster dose injection were respiratory-related infections and 
reactogenicity-related events. These events occurred with similar rates across groups. There were very 
few severe events and the findings are typical for the safety profile of mRNA-1273 across clinical trials.

The CHMP noted that the intended approach is to support the administration of a 25 µg booster dose of 
mRNA-1273.222 based on the safety and reactogenicity profile after administration of 25 µg of mRNA-
1273 as a booster dose to children 6 through 11 years of age, and to extrapolate from the known safety 
profile of a booster dose of mRNA-1273.214 and of the safety profile of a booster dose mRNA-1273.222 
(with a short follow-up duration of 37 days) given to adults.  
To support the indication extension of mRNA-1273.222 to children 6 through 11 years of age without 
safety data for the mRNA-1273.222 variant vaccine in this age group, the MAH was requested to submit a 
comparative table summarising the reactogenicity profile of a booster dose of mRNA-1273 in three age 
groups (children 6 through 11 years of age; adolescent 12-<17 years and in young adults 18-25 years of 
age) and the solicited ARs after a booster dose of mRNA-1273.214 in adults 18-25 and the solicited ARs 
after a booster dose of mRNA-1273.222 in the same age group (young adults 18-25 years). A similar 
table for unsolicited AEs (unrelated and considered being vaccine related) was also requested. The MAH 
was also requested to provide a discussion of the robustness of the extrapolation of the safety data 
across these groups (i.e. from children to adolescents and to adults, particularly focusing on the safety 
profile of a booster dose of the mRNA-1273.222 in adults.  
The comparative tables with regards to the solicited ARs and unsolicited ARs across vaccine groups were 
provided as follows:

The MAH submitted the requested additional safety data in the adult population who received a second 
booster dose of 50 μg mRNA-1273.222. No clear pattern was noted which may suggest clinical 
meaningful differences when comparisons are done between a booster dose of mRNA-1273 applied in 
children, adolescent and adults; a booster dose of mRNA-1273.214 in adults and a booster dose of 
mRNA-1273.222 administered in adults. There were observed only minor differences with regards to 
reactogenicity across the vaccine groups and age related as presented in the submitted tables: The 
incidence of any solicited local adverse reaction in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group ranged from 91.1% in 
the age group 6 through 11 years of age; to 92.1% in the age group 12 to below 18 and to 87.3% in the 
adult population; in the mRNA-1273.214 booster vaccine group 89.4% in adults and in the mRNA-
1273.222 booster vaccine group 86.3% in adult population. There were no Grade 4 local ARs reported in 
any of the group and the incidences of the Grade 3 solicited local ARs were comparable (respectively in 
the adult population (≥18 to <55 years) there were 5.1 % Grade 3 events in the mRNA-1273 group; 
3.8% in the of mRNA-1273.214 vaccine group in adults ≥18 to below 65 years of age and 5.7% in the 
mRNA-1273.222 vaccine group in adults mRNA-1273.222, with ‘Pain’ as most common reported local ARs 
for all the groups.  
The incidence of any solicited systemic adverse reaction in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group ranged from 
64.3 % in the age group 6 through 11 years of age; to 76.6 % in the age group 12 to below 18 and to 
74.7% in the adult population; in the mRNA-1273.214 booster vaccine group 74.9% in adults and in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 46/57 
 
 
 
 
 
mRNA-1273.222 booster vaccine group 76.2% in adult population. Grade 4 solicited systemic adverse 
events were reported only for fever (any fever < 0.1%) in the Study P204, mRNA-1273 vaccine group, in 
children 6 through 11 years of age. In more details fever was reported as following: in the mRNA-1273 
group 8.5% in children; 6.1% in adolescents and 7.6% in adults; in the mRNA-1273.214 booster vaccine 
group 3.4% in adults and in the mRNA-1273.222 booster vaccine group 4.0% in adults. It is observed 
that lower incidences of fever are reported in the adults in the bivalent vaccine’s groups compare to the 
Spikevax original so there are not awaited significant clinical differences in the paediatric population 
between the vaccine groups. 
The incidences of any unsolicited ARs/ treatment related were comparable between the vaccine groups as 
following: in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group ranged from (Any: 13.1 %/ Treatment related 4.0% in 
children; Any TEAEs 14.2% / Treatment related TEAEs 4.1% in adolescents; Any 33.1%/ treatment-
related TEAEs data not available for 18-25y age group currently (young adults); in the mRNA-1273.214 
booster vaccine group Any 19.2%/ treatment related TEAEs 4.8% in adults and in the mRNA-1273.222 
booster vaccine group Any 22.7%/ treatment related TEAEs 7.8 % in adult population.  
Overall, based on the comparative analysis from the clinical trials safety data, the CHMP considered that 
there are no clear trends or patterns that might lead in clinical meaningful differences with regards to the 
safety and reactogenicity between a booster dose of mRNA-1273 administered in children, adolescents 
and adults, compared with the bivalent vaccines; mRNA-1273.214 given as a booster dose in adults and 
the mRNA-1273.222 when given as a booster dose in adults. There the differences with regards to the 
sample size across the treatment groups, the timing of trials related to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants 
and the treatments related adverse reactions, including the expected variability of TEAEs age related 
(respectively children, adolescents and adults) are acknowledged. The MAH will continue to monitor the 
safety profile of mRNA-1273.222 and the prevalence of the rare events in paediatric population, which 
can be detected through post-marketing experience. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Currently, Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (mRNA-1273.222) booster vaccination is authorised 
in individuals 12 years of age and older for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
caused by SARS-CoV-2. No clinical data was provided for the sought indication of a booster dose with 
mRNA-1273.222 in children 6 through 11 years of age and the safety profile is intended to be 
extrapolated from the available safety data from mRNA-1273.222 available from the adult population and 
from the safety and reactogenicity of a 25 µg booster dose of mRNA-1273 Original vaccine given to 
children 6 through 11 years of age. 
On 15th December 2022, authorisation was given for the use of mRNA-1273.214 25 µg dose 
(Original/Omicron BA.1) as a booster vaccine for children 6 through 11 years of age. Upon request, the 
MAH confirmed that there are 181 participants in Study P204, aged 6 through 11 years of age, who 
received a mRNA-1273.214 booster vaccine. Data collected included only safety data (respectively SAEs, 
AESIs, MAAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation from study) and will become available in the final CSR, 
due in March 2024.  
To support the current inclusion of children aged 6 through 11 years of age to receive a booster dose 
(dose 4) of the bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.222 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5), the MAH has submitted 
safety data from the Study mRNA-1273-P205 Part G (mRNA-1273.214; Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 as a 2nd booster dose and Part F Cohort 2 (mRNA-1273; Spikevax original as a 2nd 
booster dose). Regarding the reactogenicity these data have been assessed during the procedures 
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/75/G and EMEA/H/C/005791/II/84/G. However, in this submission there is a longer 
median follow-up time, respectively 113 days and 127 days and the reported unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 47/57 
 
 
 
 
SAEs and fatal events have been included. None of these study parts include children aged 6 through 11 
years of age. 
Part G (mRNA-1273.214): Solicited ARs were reported for 87% of participants after booster dose. 
Solicited local ARs were reported for 79.4% participants and the most common reported were: injection 
site pain (77.3%), followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (17.4%). Solicited systemic ARs were 
reported for 70.3% participants, with the most common reported: fatigue (54.9%), followed by headache 
(43.9%). Most local and systemic ARs were Grade 1 and Grade and none were Grade 4. 
Part F Cohort 2 (mRNA-1273): Solicited ARs were reported for 85.7% participants after the booster dose. 
Solicited local ARs were reported for 79.4% participants and the most common reported were: injection 
site pain (76.6%), followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (15.1%). Solicited systemic ARs were 
reported in 66.0% participants and the most reported were: fatigue (51.3%) followed by headache 
(41.0%). Most solicited systemic ARs were Grade 1 and Grade 2 and none were Grade 4. Most solicited 
ARs were reported with onset from Days 1-3 after the booster dose, and the median duration was 2.0 
days.  
Slightly higher incidences of local and systemic adverse events were observed, when comparing mRNA-
1273.214 50 μg administered as second booster to mRNA-1273 50 μg given as booster dose. However, 
these differences were not clinically significant and are not considered to have a significant impact on the 
safety profile of mRNA-1273.214 when compared to that of mRNA-1273. No clinically meaningful 
imbalances were seen in subgroup analyses with regards to the frequencies when stratifying according to 
SARS-CoV-2- status and age group.  
The incidences of unsolicited TEAEs regardless of relationship to study vaccination and those related to 
study vaccination were comparable between the two parts after the booster dose. There were no 
imbalances reported after the booster dose for both parts with regards to the severe TEAEs, with 
comparable incidences (0.9% vs 0.8%). Fatigue is a known adverse drug reaction and it is included in the 
section 4.8 of the SmPC, therefore no additional clinical information is requested with regards to the 
severe event of fatigue with duration from Day 1-14 in the mRNA-1273.214 booster group.  
With regards to the TEAEs considered vaccine related observed in the two parts, had a slightly lower 
incidence in the mRNA-1273.214 booster dose group compared to the mRNA-1273 group, respectively 
4.8% vs 5.6%. The AEs persisting beyond Day 7 are related to the known reactogenicity of mRNA-1273 
and all the events considered as vaccine related are already included as ADRs at the Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. There were three fatal events reported up to data cut-off. Two deaths were reported in the mRNA-
1273.214 booster group; one death of unknown case and one other fatal event of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease. One fatal event of hypotension was reported in the mRNA-1273 booster group. All 
three events were considered not to be related to the study vaccine by the investigator and the CHMP 
supported this conclusion. SAEs were reported for 1.8 % participants in part G (prostate cancer and 
traumatic fracture) up to data cut-off both considered not to be related to study vaccine. In Part F Cohort 
2, the SAEs were reported 2.7% participants (2.7%), with one unrelated event of spinal osteoarthritis 
within 28 days. MAAEs (related and unrelated to vaccination) did not reveal any safety signals for both 
two parts, with lower incidence of MAAEs after the second booster dose with the original Spikevax 
(mRNA-1273), respectively 39.1% vs 47.9%. The same applies for the SOCs accordingly 23.8% vs 
29.0%, and no significant imbalances were observed for the PT events between the two groups. No 
events of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported in both booster dose groups. The additional review 
done for the unrecognised cases did not reveal any new cases.  
Study mRNA-1273-P205 Part H (mRNA-1273.222; Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 as 2nd 
booster vaccine): This part of the study includes 511 participants with a median follow-up duration of 37 
days after 50 μg mRNA-1273.222 booster dose.  
Assessment report

The safety data was evaluated during EMEA/H/C/005791/077 and showed the following: any solicited 
adverse reactions reported by 87.2% participants; local ARs (82.8%) with pain as most common 
(82.4%); systemic ARs (73.2%) with fatigue as most common (59.8%). No clinically meaningful 
imbalances were seen in subgroup analyses with regards to the frequencies when stratifying according to 
the age group: Solicited ARs were more reported in the ≥18 to <65 years age group (89.8%) compared 
to the ≥65 years age group with (77.1%). Mostly of the events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 and Grade 3 
accordingly (12.2% versus 9.5%). No grade 4 were reported. Unsolicited AEs considered vaccine related 
were reported by 7.8% participants, MAAEs reported by 13.7 % participants and none considered to be 
related to the study IP. There was one death Subarachnoid haemorrhage reported in a ≥70 year old male 
participant, assessed as not related to the vaccine due to the participants underlying disease and 
medications. There were four SAEs reported in 3 participants: the fatal event of subarachnoid 
haemorrhage; events of anginal equivalent and syncope and one event of anaemia, considered as 
unrelated to the vaccination.  
No events of potential myocarditis or pericarditis were identified with the CMQ for participants in the 
mRNA-1273.222 50 μg (Part H). From the post-marketing experience there was one reported case of 
‘unassessable’ pericarditis due to important missing information.  
Overall, the CHMP considered that the review of the clinical safety data of mRNA-1273.222 showed that 
the benefit-risk profile of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster vaccine was favourable for 
individuals 12 years of age and older. 
Study mRNA-1273-P204 
The safety data used to support the marketing authorisation of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
in individuals 6 through 11 years of age has been assessed during EMEA/H/C/005791/II/83/G. The MAH 
indicated that longer term safety data for a booster dose in children 6 through 11 years of age (6 months 
of safety follow-up on at least 1000 boosted participants) is anticipated to be available at the end of 
2023. As participants in P204 are still being boosted currently, the proposed timing is tentative. The MAH 
also provided comparative tables summarising the solicited local and systemic ARs, concluding that the 
incidences of any local solicited ARs were similar across all of the age groups, from 87.3% to 92.1%. 
Most of the events were Grade 1 and Grade 2; the 6 through 11 years of age group tended to have more 
Grade 2 events than the other groups. Grade 3 events occurred less frequently, and more frequently after 
a 100 μg booster dose than a 50 μg booster dose; no trends were identified across the age ranges. There 
were no Grade 4 solicited local ARs. The most commonly reported solicited local AR was pain, with a 
similar incidence across age ranges (86.1% to 91.7%). This was followed by axillary swelling or 
tenderness (21.3% to 28.0%), which tended to occur more commonly in the two younger age groups, 
including Grade 3 events which were not reported in the adult groups.  
The incidence of solicited systemic ARs was similar across the 3 older age groups (74.7% to 76.6%) in 
contrast to children (6 through 11 years of age) in which the overall rate was 64.3%. Rates of solicited 
systemic ARs were the lowest in all categories in the 6 through 11 years of age group except for fever 
where children had the highest rate (8.5%), including one Grade 4 event. Fever was least common in the 
mRNA-1273.214 group (3.4%). Children (6 through 11 years of age) generally experienced lower 
incidence rates than the older 3 age groups for the solicited systemic ARs of headache, fatigue, myalgia, 
arthralgia, and chills with absolute differences of 10 to 20%. Systemic reactogenicity tended to be lower 
in the mRNA-1273.214 group compared to the adolescent and adult mRNA-1273 groups in the events of 
fever, headache, nausea/vomiting, and chills. Across the groups the incidence of Grade 3 systemic ARs 
ranged from 6.0% to 8.2%, with children (6 through 11 years of age) having the lowest overall incidence 
and adolescents having the highest. As reporting rates were low for individual event terms, differences 
across the groups were not notable. The largest difference was for myalgia, where children (6 through 11 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 49/57 
 
 
 
 
years of age) had Grade 3 ARs in 1.9% whereas the other age groups had Grade 3 events in 3.4% to 
3.8% of participants. 
Overall, while children (6 through 11 years of age) tended to demonstrate less systemic reactogenicity 
than older age groups with the exception of fever, there were no findings concerning for overall 
tolerability in any of the treatment groups. 
The intended approach is to support the administration of a 25 µg booster dose of mRNA-1273.222 based 
on the safety and reactogenicity profile after administration of 25 µg of mRNA-1273 as a booster dose to 
children 6 through 11 years of age, and to extrapolate from the known safety profile of a booster dose of 
mRNA-1273.214 and of the safety profile of a booster dose mRNA-1273.222 (with a follow-up duration 
time of 37 days) given to adults.  
To support the indication extension of mRNA-1273.222 to children 6 through 11 years of age without 
safety data for the mRNA-1273.222 variant vaccine in this age group, the MAH was requested to provide 
a summary of the reactogenicity profile of a booster dose of mRNA-1273 in three age groups (children 6 
through 11 years of age; adolescent 12-<17 years and in young adults 18-25 years of age) and the 
solicited ARs after a booster dose of mRNA-1273.214 in adults 18-25 and the solicited ARs after a booster 
dose of mRNA-1273.222 in the same age group (young adults 18-25 years). 
Overall, based on the comparative analysis from the clinical trials safety data, no clear trend or pattern 
was observed that might lead in clinical meaningful differences with regards to the safety and 
reactogenicity between a booster dose of mRNA-1273 administered in children, adolescents and adults, 
compared with the bivalent vaccines; mRNA-1273.214 given as a booster dose in adults and the mRNA-
1273.222 when given as a booster dose in adults. The differences with regards to the sample size across 
the treatment groups, the timing of trials related to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and the treatments 
related adverse reactions, including the expected variability of TEAEs age related (respectively children, 
adolescents and adults) are acknowledged. Post-marketing surveillance activities will continue to monitor 
the safety profile of mRNA-1273.222 and the prevalence of the rare events in paediatric population, 
which can be detected through post-marketing experience. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No clinical data was provided to support the sought indication of a booster dose with mRNA-1273.222 in 
children 6 through 11 years of age and the safety profile is intended to be extrapolated from the safety 
data from mRNA-1273.222 available from the adult population and from the safety and reactogenicity of 
a 25 µg booster dose of mRNA-1273 Original vaccine given to children 6 through 11 years of age.  
Additional supportive data was provided on the use of mRNA-1273.214 as a second booster, compared to 
data on mRNA-1273 administered as a second booster dose in the adult population. The review of all the 
submitted safety data did not show any clear trend or pattern of clinical meaningful differences with 
regards to the safety and reactogenicity between a booster dose of mRNA-1273 administered in children, 
adolescents and adults, compared with the bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.214 given as a booster dose in 
adults and the bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.222 when given as a booster dose in adults. Post-marketing 
surveillance activities will continue to monitor the safety profile of mRNA-1273.222 and the prevalence of 
the rare events in paediatric population, which can be detected through post-marketing experience. 
The current interval for the booster dose in the posology section of the SmPC is currently 3 months after 
primary series.

2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 6.5 with data lock point of 17th September 2022 and final 
sign-off date of 7th February 2023 with this application. The (main) proposed RMP changes were the 
following: 
•  To update the indication and posology for Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 for 
individuals 6 years of age and older 
•  To update the qualitative and quantitative composition for Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 
•  To update the products overview table in Module SI in line with the current SmPC 
•  To update the indication in the Epidemiology for Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 for 
use in individuals 6 years of age and older  
•  To update Module SVII.2 to state no changes to the safety concerns 
•  To update the indication in the Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 for use in individuals 6 years of age and older 
Part I – Product overview 
The information provided in Part I is considered sufficient and is acceptable. Few editorial comments for 
the next RMP update are made below. 
Part II module SI – Epidemiology of the indication and the target population 
The indication has been updated in this module, which is acceptable. The wording of the indication 
included in this section will also have to be aligned at the next RMP update. 
Part II module SVII.2 – New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated RMP 
The module has been updated to state that there are no changes in safety concerns. This is acceptable.  
Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
The indication has been updated in this module, which is acceptable. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 6.5 is acceptable. In addition, minor 
revisions were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update, as follows: 
1.  In the section ‘Indication(s) in the EEA’ in the RMP, a paragraph break may be inserted between 
‘Proposed:’ and ‘Spikevax […]’ to increase readability, as outlined below:  
Current:  
[…]  Spikevax  bivalent  Original/Omicron  BA.4-5  is  indicated  for  active  immunisation  to  prevent 
COVID-19  caused  by  SARS-CoV-2  in  individuals  12  years  of  age  and  older  who  have  previously 
received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19. 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023

Proposed: Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is indicated for active immunisation to 
prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 6 years of age and older who have 
previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19. 
2.  In the section ‘Dosage in the EEA’ in the RMP, ‘Proposed’ and ‘Current’ should have a similar 
font, i.e. non-bold. Moreover, the specification ‘Individuals’ and ‘Children’ 12 and 6 years of age 
and older, respectively, should be used consistently, i.e. both for Spikevax bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 and BA.4-5. 
3.  In Part II module SI, the wording of the indication should be brought up in line with the PI:  
Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-
19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 6 years of age and older who have previously received 
at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19, after primary COVID-19 immunisation. 
2.7.  Changes to the Product information 
As a result of this group of variations, sections 2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated to 
reflect the use of a 25 μg booster dose of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (12.5 μg 
elasomeran /12.5 μg davesomeran) in children aged 6 through 11 years of age. The Package Leaflet and 
Labelling are updated in accordance. Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 SmPC are further updated to add additional ADR details and clinical data. 
In addition, sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 SmPC are also updated, 
to add median follow-up period and D91 persistence data. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Finally, the MAH took the opportunity to implement a number of editorial changes to the product 
information, including the update of section 5.1 of the SmPC for all Spikevax products, to reflect the 
correct VE values based on the P301 case definition for children 2 through 5 years of age and 6 through 
23 months of age. 
Please refer to Attachment 1. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more 
severe diseases, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Coronaviruses are also zoonotic, with different 
species causing disease in other mammals, such as bats and cats. 
An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 began in Wuhan, Hubei 
Province, China in December 2019, and the disease quickly spread globally (WHO 2020). This virus is not 
Assessment report

known to have previously caused disease in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared 
COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30th January 2020 and 
declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th March 2020. 
Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via exposure to infectious respiratory fluids in 3 
principal ways: 1) inhalation of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles; 2) deposition of respiratory 
droplets and aerosol particles on mucous membranes in the mouth, nose, or eye by direct splashes 
and/or sprays; and 3) touching mucous membranes with hands that have been soiled either directly by 
respiratory fluids or indirectly by contact with fomites (CDC 2021). 
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals has also been 
documented and may account for an estimated 59% of transmission (Johansson et al 2021). 
Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever and cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
muscle aches, chills, sore throat, headache, and the distinctive symptoms of loss of taste or smell. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly changing over time. 
After the onset of the Omicron wave, the demographics of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 shifted to 
younger age groups (UK Health Security Agency 2021; Abdullah et al 2022; Goga et al 2021). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
While the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine encoding the original strain is maintained against severe disease, 
the efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity wanes over time. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology has 
changed rapidly over time and new SARS-CoV-2 strains have emerged. The Spikevax bivalent variant 
mRNA vaccine containing the original strain together with the Omicron BA.1 strain has been approved for 
individuals 12 years of age and older, subsequently followed by the approval of Spikevax 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in the same age group. In the adult clinical development program, two doses of 
100 μg mRNA-1273 demonstrated 93.2% (95% CI: 91.0%, 94.8%; p < 0.0001) efficacy against COVID-
19 in more than 30,000 participants over a median observation period of over 5.3 months. Effectiveness 
against Omicron-related COVID-19 declined after time, but could be enhanced after a 50 µg booster dose. 
Successful immunobridging of booster responses between children 6 through 11 years of age and young 
adults post-primary series from Study mRNA-1273-P301 provides confidence that the booster benefit 
afforded to adults will also be afforded to children. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study mRNA-1273-P205 
Study mRNA-1273-P205 is an ongoing open-label Phase 2/3 study with multiple, sequentially enrolled 
cohorts to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of variant-targeting booster candidate vaccines. 
mRNA-1273.222 is the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 booster vaccine that contains 25 µg Original 
SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA and 25 µg Omicron BA.4-5 Spike mRNA. The study consists of 7 parts: A, (1, 
2), B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. 
Part F (Cohort 2)- 50 μg of the mRNA-1273 administered as a second booster dose to adult participants 
who previously received 2 doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273 as a primary series and 1 booster dose of 50 μg 
mRNA-1273. 
Part G- Second booster dose 50 µg mRNA-1273.214: Participants who received 100 µg mRNA-1273 
primary series and a booster dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273. 
Assessment report  
EMA/230596/2023 
Page 53/57 
 
 
 
 
Part H - Second booster dose 50 µg mRNA-1273.222: Participants who received 100 µg mRNA-1273 
primary series and a booster dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273. 
Study mRNA-1273 P204 
Study mRNA-1273 P204 is an ongoing Phase 2/3, 3-part, dose-escalation (open-label), age de-escalation 
and randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study to evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in children 6 months to 11 years. 
The study population was evaluated in 3 discrete age groups (6 through 11 years of age, 2 years to <6 
years, and 6 months to <2 years), assessing up to 3 dosage levels (25, 50, and 100 μg) of mRNA-1273 
in the primary series. For each of the three age groups, an open-label dose-finding (Part 1) phase 
preceded a blinded, placebo-controlled (Part 2) phase which evaluated the selected dose of mRNA-1273 
in a placebo-controlled fashion. Data regarding the mRNA-1273 primary series for all age groups in P204 
has been previously submitted and primary series of 50 μg is currently authorised for use in children from 
6 through 11 years of age. In a subsequent amendment, the protocol was revised to offer the mRNA-
1273 primary series to P204 participants randomised to placebo once vaccination against COVID-19 was 
authorised in the respective age group. Following evidence of enhanced effectiveness of the adult booster 
dose, study P204 was amended to offer a booster dose of 25 µg mRNA-1273 to all children enrolled in the 
6 through 11 years age group, which could be administered starting 6 months post-dose 2 of the primary 
series. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
It is reasonably likely that Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 will elicit a superior neutralising 
antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4-5 and a non-inferior neutralising antibody response 
against the Original SARS-CoV-2 strain in children 6 through 11 years of age. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No clinical results have been provided for the sought indication of a booster dose with mRNA-1273.222 in 
children 6 through 11 years of age. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
After receipt of a 25 µg booster dose of mRNA-1273 at least 6 months after the primary vaccination, 
93.2% of children 6 through 11 years of age reported any solicited AR. Any solicited local AR was 
reported by 91.1% of participants. Pain was the most reported solicited local AR (90.1% of participants), 
followed by Axillary (or Groin) Swelling or Tenderness (27.8%) and erythema (10.7%) and 
swelling/hardness (10.9%). Any systemic solicited AR was reported by 64.3% of participants. The most 
frequently reported systemic solicited AR was fatigue (48.9%), followed by headache (38.2%) and 
myalgia (21.0%). Chills, nausea, and arthralgia were reported by comparable proportions of subjects, i.e. 
by 14.0%, 13.1%, and 12.5%, respectively. Fever was reported by 8.5% of subjects. 
Solicited ARs had a median onset within 1 day after vaccination and a median duration of 3 days. 
Solicited local ARs persisting beyond 7 days after booster dose administration were reported in 1.3% of 
participants. The most common events were axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness (0.7%) and pain 
(0.5%). Solicited systemic ARs persisting beyond 7 days after booster vaccination were reported in 2.0% 
of participants. The most common events were fatigue (1.3%) and headache (1.0%).

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Even though the course of COVID-19 in children is generally milder than in the older population, there are 
individuals that suffer considerably from the direct consequences of the infection. It is therefore important 
to have access to COVID-19 variant vaccines for this population. 
3.6.2.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk of the administration of a 25 µg booster dose of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 in children 6 through 11 years of age is considered positive. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 as a booster dose in children 6 
through 11 years of age is considered positive.

study mRNA-1273-P205 (NCT04927065), an open-label Phase 2/3 study evaluating the immunogenicity 
and safety of variant-targeting booster candidate vaccines. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
- C.I.z (Type II): To update sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 SmPC 
to add ADR details and clinical data, based on Part H (mRNA- 1273.222) of study mRNA-1273-P205 
(NCT04927065), an open-label Phase 2/3 study evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of variant-
targeting booster candidate vaccines. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder took the opportunity to implement a number of editorial 
changes to the product information. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, the Labelling 
and the Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annexes I, IIIA and IIIB and 
to the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0256/2022 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes

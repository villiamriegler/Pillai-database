Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Victoza 
liraglutide 
On 28 April 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Victoza. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Novo Nordisk A/S. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication in type 2 diabetes to include:  
“Monotherapy 
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use 
of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications.” 
For information, the full indications for Victoza will be as follows2: 
“Victoza is indicated for treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to achieve glycaemic 
control as:  
Monotherapy 
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for 
whom use of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications.  
Combination therapy 
In combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and/or basal insulin when these, 
together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4 and 
5.1 for available data on the different combinations).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Avastin (bevacizumab) was first approved in 2005 for first line treatment of metastatic colon or rectum 
cancer in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Following the approval of two type 
II variations, the therapeutic indication for Avastin has been extended to include first-line treatment of 
metastatic breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel (II/08 and II/24, respectively).  
The MAH submitted a request for a further variation (EMEA/H/C/582/II/0033) to extend the breast 
cancer indication with inclusion of treatment in combination with anthracycline-based or capecitabine 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. This request is based, inter alia, on the pivotal study AVF3694g (Ribbon-1). 
This study included a cohort of patients who received a choice of taxane combination (either protein-
bound paclitaxel [nab-paclitaxel] or docetaxel) and four different anthracycline regimens. While the 
study was not powered to demonstrate the efficacy of bevacizumab for each one of the combinations, 
a negative trend for overall survival (OS) was observed in the subgroup of patients receiving the 
combination bevacizumab + taxane, in addition to a benefit in terms of progression free survival (PFS) 
smaller than anticipated in previous studies. Furthermore, the addition of bevacizumab to the base 
treatment resulted in a higher incidence of some grade > 3 adverse events including febrile 
neutropenia, diarrhoea, sepsis, dehydration, GI perforation and cellulites. 
In view of the above the European Commission initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004. The European Commission requested the CHMP on 23 September 2010 to assess 
the above concerns and its impact on the benefit/risk for Avastin, and to give its opinion on whether 
the marketing authorisation for this product should be maintained, varied, suspended or withdrawn. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is a complex disease that is essentially incurable. There is no single 
standard of care for mBC and treatment requires an individualised approach based on multiple factors. 
In determining the best choice of treatment, physicians consider the disease characteristics, prior 
breast cancer treatment, therapeutic goals, patient’s characteristics and preferences. Taxane-based 
chemotherapy (paclitaxel or docetaxel), either alone or in combination with other agents, is recognised 
as a worldwide standard of care for the treatment of breast cancer. It is important to note that these 
agents are not interchangeable because of their differential efficacy and safety profiles. 
Reducing the burden of disease (measured in clinical trials as response rate) and delaying the burden 
of disease (measured as PFS) are important patient and physician goals in the treatment of mBC. Both 
measures represent an important and meaningful clinical benefit that can be attributed directly to a 
specific treatment and are not confounded by subsequent lines of therapy. Increasing the time that a 
patient lives without the cancer growing or spreading represents a benefit in terms of maintaining 
symptom-free living, quality of life (QoL) and delaying the onset of clinical sequelae associated with 
worsening metastatic disease or additional chemotherapies. 
PFS is a composite measure of time to disease progression or death. Because in mBC the extent of 
disease can be reliably measured on radiographs, PFS is an accepted measure of clinical efficacy that 
can be directly attributed to a regimen and an appropriate endpoint in clinical trials in oncology. 
Ultimately, improving OS is a major goal of treatment. However, demonstrating an improvement in OS 
in first-line mBC clinical trials is difficult to achieve because OS is often confounded by subsequent 
lines of therapy for recurrent disease.  
While it is accepted that in clinical trials an increase in PFS may not be accompanied by increased OS, 
it is important to ensure that OS is not ultimately compromised. A negative effect on OS observed in 
the presence of increased PFS and response rate could be indicative of a long-term negative effect of 
treatment. 
In order for the CHMP to reconsider the benefit-risk balance of Avastin in the mBC indication, the MAH 
submitted a summary of all clinical trial data available on the combination of bevacizumab + taxanes 
(paclitaxel and docetaxel). It is important to note that as the two taxanes are not interchangeable the 
evaluation of benefit-risk balance for the combination of bevacizumab with paclitaxel and docetaxel 
must be done separately.

2.1.  Clinical aspects 
2.1.1.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical benefit of bevacizumab combined with either paclitaxel or docetaxel was demonstrated in 
two large positive phase III randomised studies, E2100 and BO17708, respectively, which were the 
basis for the approval of the indication in the European Union. Additional supportive trials include the 
phase III AVF3694g study, phase II studies (which incorporated paclitaxel + bevacizumab as a control 
or experimental arm) and a large safety study (MO19391) conducted in the postmarketing setting 
(which included bevacizumab in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel).

Study AVF3694g 
AVF3694g is the pivotal study submitted in the application for the approval of the combination 
bevacizumab+capecitabine (variation II/33). It was a phase III multicenter, double-blind, placebo-
controlled randomised trial that investigated the combination of bevacizumab and standard 
chemotherapy in patients who had not received chemotherapy for their HER2-negative mBC. In order 
to reflect the oncology community standard practices and approach to treatment decisions, the class of 
chemotherapy (taxane/anthracycline-based chemotherapy or capecitabine) was chosen by the 
investigators prior to randomisation from a set of commonly used regimens specified in the study 
protocol. Patients were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to chemotherapy+bevacizumab or 
chemotherapy+placebo. 
The primary objective was to compare PFS (as assessed by the investigator) in patients randomised to 
bevacizumab+chemotherapy versus placebo+chemotherapy. Statistical analyses were performed 
independently for 1) patients who received either taxane-based or anthracycline-based chemotherapy 
in combination with bevacizumab/placebo; and 2) patients who received capecitabine in combination 
with bevacizumab/placebo. The secondary objectives included ORR, OS, 1-year survival rate, duration 
of objective response, PFS by independent review committee and safety.

Both cohorts were independently powered for efficacy, but the individual combinations within the

Study MO19391 
Study MO19391, a Phase IV open-label, non-comparative, international, multicentre trial, was 
conducted in patients with first-line locally recurrent or mBC receiving bevacizumab in combination 
with a taxane or other chemotherapies. All patients received treatment with bevacizumab (weekly 
equivalent of 5 mg/kg/wk) plus taxane monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapies. The 
primary objective was to assess the safety profile of bevacizumab when combined with taxane 
monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy. The most common treatment regimens 
during this study were paclitaxel + bevacizumab (779 [34.4%] patients) and docetaxel + bevacizumab 
(741 [32.7%] patients).

2.1.1.1.  Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel 
Clinical studies 
The benefit-risk assessment of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel as first-line treatment of 
patients with mBC is based on the primary data from study E2100.  
Study AVF3694g included nab-paclitaxel as a choice within the taxane/anthracycline cohort. Albumin-
bound paclitaxel is distinct from paclitaxel in its efficacy and safety profile despite sharing the same 
active moiety, as they differ in formulation. Nab-paclitaxel is a biologically interactive, nanometer-sized 
albumin-bound paclitaxel particle that was initially developed to increase efficacy and minimize the 
toxicities associated with standard paclitaxel therapy. Despite these differences, the data from the 
AVF3694g subset of the taxane/anthracycline cohort are relevant and are discussed in the benefit-risk 
assessment for paclitaxel + bevacizumab.  
As such, the benefit-risk assessment for paclitaxel + bevacizumab is supported by relevant data from 
study AVF3694g, study MO19391, and other published phase II and phase III trials and is discussed in 
the following sections. The number of patients treated with paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel is shown for 
each study in table 2.

Progression-Free Survival 
Study E2100 
E2100 was designed as an open-label study in which the primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by the 
treating investigator. This section presents the analyses from both the investigator and the 
independent review assessments, with focus on the blinded independent review of PFS. 
The results from the analysis of PFS by the investigator and independent review are shown in table 3. 
Disease progression and tumour response were assessed by the investigator and confirmed by ECOG 
(based on an unblinded review of data submitted by the investigator), according to RECIST (response 
evaluation criteria in solid tumours).  
The stratified analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS based on investigator assessment for all 
randomised patients demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant increase in PFS among 
patients in the paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm compared with those in the paclitaxel alone arm 
(p 0.0001), with an associated increase in median PFS from 5.8 to 11.4 months. The stratified hazard 
ratio (HR) for the paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm relative to the paclitaxel alone arm was 0.42 (95% CI: 
0.34, 0.52). These findings were corroborated by the blinded IRC assessment. Figure 2 presents the 
Kaplan–Meier plot for investigator-assessed PFS, and figure 3 presents the plot for PFS as assessed by 
the IRC review. Both curves are very similar and show an early and consistent separation between the 
two treatment groups, favouring the bevacizumab+paclitaxel arm.

Comparisons of results in subgroups based on the IRC assessment were performed. The reduction in 
the risk of progression or death in clinically important patient subgroups was generally consistent with 
the results seen in the overall analysis. There was a consistent increase in PFS observed across all 
subgroups of patients in the paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm, including those with a poor prognosis or 
response to treatment. The benefit of adding bevacizumab to paclitaxel was seen irrespective of age, 
prior therapy (anthracyclines or taxanes), disease-free interval, sites of disease or tumour burden 
quantified by size of target lesions in patients with measurable disease, or hormone receptor status, 
including patients with negative results for ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 (i.e., triple-
negative patients).  
As additional evidence to address potential biases and to assess the robustness of the primary results, 
a range of sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of tumour assessments as well

as missing IRC scans on the PFS results. The analyses also investigated the impact of not censoring for 
non-protocol therapy, including deaths that occurred at any time and patient discontinuation on PFS. 
In all cases, a statistically significant treatment effect was seen. The benefit in terms of a statistically 
significant HR in favour of paclitaxel+bevacizumab in E2100 was seen in all of the sensitivity analysis 
performed. 
Published Phase II and III Studies and Study MO19391 
Median PFS with the combination of bevacizumab+paclitaxel was reported in four recently published 
phase II and III clinical trials in patients with previously untreated (first-line) HER2-negative mBC.  
Three of these four new studies reported a median PFS longer than 11 months, consistent with the 
result of 11.4 months from study E2100 for the paclitaxel + bevacizumab regimen.  
Additionally, data from a large Phase IV study MO19391 in which 325 patients received weekly 
paclitaxel+bevacizumab, reported, after a median follow-up of 20.1 months, a Kaplan-Meier estimate 
for the median time to progression of 10.6 (95% CI 9.2, 11.8) months. 
Study AVF3694g 
The taxane/anthracycline comparison of study AVF3694g included a selection of either docetaxel or 
nab-paclitaxel. Exploratory analyses were conducted on the subset of patients treated with nab-
paclitaxel+bevacizumab/placebo (table 4). In this small subgroup the hazard ratio of 0.64 for PFS with 
a p<0.10 is suggestive of a treatment benefit with a 2.9 month difference between median PFS of both 
treatment arms.

The data from this subgroup analysis confirms the previously observed benefit in terms of PFS in 
E2100 from the combination of paclitaxel and bevacizumab compared with paclitaxel alone. Due to the 
small sample size (n=46 placebo and n=78 bevacizumab) the p-value was not significant, but the 
trend is clearly favorable for the combination therapy. 
Overall Survival 
Study E2100 
OS was included as a secondary outcome measure in study E2100. An updated and pre-specified 
analysis of OS at 481 deaths was performed with 60% of events included.  
Median OS was 24.8 and 26.5 months for the paclitaxel alone and paclitaxel + bevacizumab arms, 
respectively (table 5), although the 1.7 month improvement was not statistically significant. As data 
for subsequent lines of therapy were not collected in this study it is not possible to interpret the 
potential impact of post-progression bevacizumab therapy on OS.

Results of the exploratory analysis for the small number of patients in the nab-paclitaxel+bevacizumab 
(n  78) and nab-paclitaxel+placebo (n  46) subset, which was not stratified, should be interpreted 
with caution. Study AVF3694g included optional crossover to bevacizumab after disease progression.  
Objective Response Rate 
ORR, a direct measure of a product’s activity, is particularly relevant for patients with rapidly 
progressive visceral metastatic disease.  
Study E2100 
ORR is commonly reported in patients with measurable disease. In study E2100, ORR was statistically 
significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the paclitaxel+bevacizumab arm (48.0%) compared with the 
paclitaxel alone arm (23.4%), an increase of 24.6%. The table below presents the overall response 
rate as determined by the investigator and the IRC.

Note: Objective response was defined as a complete or partial response (according to RECIST) 
determined by two consecutive investigator assessments  4 weeks apart. The 95% CI for response

difference in response rates was computed by using the standard normal approximation. The p-value 
is from the Pearson 2 test (unstratified analysis) or Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test (stratified 
analysis). The strata were disease-free interval ( 24,  24 months), number of metastatic sites ( 3, 
 3), adjuvant chemotherapy (yes, no), and ER status (positive, negative, or unknown).  
Data cut-off: February 9, 2005. 
The incidence of progressive disease (PD) as best overall response, i.e., PD at the first tumour 
assessment (an indication of no clinical benefit), was lower in the paclitaxel+bevacizumab arm of 
E2100 compared with the paclitaxel alone arm based on the IRC assessment (25.5% in paclitaxel 
alone arm vs. 11.8% in paclitaxel+bevacizumab arm).  
Study AVF3694g 
The response rate increase observed in the subset of nab-paclitaxel treated patients in study 
AVF3694g compared with control patients was similar to that observed in study E2100.

Quality of Life 
Study E2100 
In study E2100, QoL data were collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast 
(FACT-B) questionnaire and assessed as a secondary objective. The primary measure of QoL in study 
E2100 was measured by the treatment outcome index (TOI), which includes measurements of physical 
well-being, functional well-being, and breast cancer subscale. Using this QoL data, a number of 
analyses were performed, with different imputation rules for missing QoL values that correspond to 
various degrees of conservativeness. The analyses with and without imputation of missing values 
demonstrate a relative benefit of bevacizumab addition on QoL scores. The primary analysis, as 
specified in the statistical analysis plan, yields a statistically significant difference in favour of the 
bevacizumab-containing arm.  
The QoL findings should be interpreted in the context of the main clinical efficacy results. The FACT-B 
is a validated questionnaire and a number of additional analyses with different imputations rules for 
missing data were performed to address a well known problem. This supports a relative benefit of 
bevacizumab addition on QoL scores. However the reliability of these data is questionable due to the 
open-label design of the study. QoL was not measured in the other supportive studies. 
2.1.1.2.  Bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel 
Clinical studies 
The benefit-risk assessment of bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel as first-line treatment of 
patients with mBC is based on the primary data from study BO17708.  
The benefit-risk assessment for docetaxel+bevacizumab is supported by relevant data from study 
AVF3694g. The number of patients treated with docetaxel is shown for each study in table 9.

The prespecified final analysis of PFS in study BO17708 was to occur when 430 events had been 
reached, corresponding to a data cut-off date of October 31, 2007. However, because of the rapid 
patient enrolment, the duration of follow-up at the time of the initial analysis was limited (median 
follow-up of approximately 10 months). Therefore, the dataset comprised predominantly patients who 
progressed early. Data from those patients still on treatment, which were censored in the analysis, 
limited the interpretation and hindered the reliable estimation of median PFS. The MAH performed a 
further PFS analysis at the time of the final OS analysis (data cut-off April 30, 2009), which provided 
sufficient follow-up.  
Following the CHMP’s request at the time of approval, further OS follow-up analysis was performed 
post authorisation (cut-off date of February 28, 2010). 
For the primary efficacy and safety analysis, the April 30, 2009 cut-off will be the main focus of the 
discussion, with the exception of OS and mortality for which the February 28, 2010 cut-off will be 
discussed.

Progression-Free Survival 
Study BO17708 
In the updated analysis, the hazard ratio for PFS for bevacizumab-containing arms was similar to that 
reported for the original analysis. Median PFS for the bevacizumab-containing arm was 10.1 months 
and the difference between the both arms was 1.9 months.

Bv15 + Doc arm: Updated analysis (Intent-to-Treat population) 
Data cut-off: April 30, 2009. 
Subgroup analyses were performed in order to assess the consistency of the PFS benefit in the Bv15 + 
Doc arm. The results of each of the subgroup analyses for PFS were consistent with those seen for all 
patients. It is noted that for women <50 years of age, the median PFS with addition of bevacizumab 
was 10.3 months and that in the placebo group it was 10.4 months. The HR was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.70 – 
1.32). The number of patients in this subgroup was not inconsiderable (n=179) and there were 
approximately 80 events in both groups, but obviously the confidence intervals are wider compared to 
the ITT analysis. Likewise, for pre-menopausal women (n=115), the HR was 0.97. Thus, it seems that 
in younger pre-menopausal women, the effect of adding bevacizumab on PFS was even minor.

The robustness of the primary result was confirmed in an exploratory Cox regression analysis on PFS 
that took account of prognostic factors. 
Study AVF3694g 
Exploratory analyses were conducted on the subset of patients treated with docetaxel + 
bevacizumab/placebo. Table 11 summarizes the PFS results for the docetaxel subgroup in study 
AVF3694g. The hazard ratio of 0.78 indicates that the numeric improvement in PFS of 0.8 months 
observed was not statistically significant.

Study BO17708 
For the primary analysis available at the time of approval of the combination between bevacizumab 
and docetaxel for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer, no statistically significant difference 
in OS was detected when comparing both arms. It was however noted that the curves cross over at 24 
months and that the end of the curves is not reliable due to censoring.  
For the follow-up analysis of OS (data cut-off February 28, 2010), survival information was collected 
up to 4 years after the first patient’s initial dose of study treatment. No further information on 
treatment compliance, concurrent diseases, concomitant medications, or tumour progression was 
collected for this further OS follow-up analysis.  
The results of the follow-up analysis, shown in the table below, are similar to the primary OS analysis. 
No impact on OS was observed. The hazard ratio for the stratified analysis for the bevacizumab arms 
compared with the placebo arm was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.23). Median OS was 31.7 months in the 
docetaxel only arm and 28.1 months in the bevacizumab+docetaxel arm. The Kaplan–Meier curves are 
shown in figure 6.

It is noted that there are imbalances between both treatment arms with respect to prognostic factors, 
although they were minor (up to 15% difference) and therefore do not explain the difference observed.  
Within the subgroup of docetaxel treated patients, hazard ratios for OS for key clinical subgroups such 
as age, hormone receptor status and history of prior treatments did not reveal a specific subgroup that 
contributed significantly to the overall hazard ratio. 
Objective response rate 
Study BO17708 
Consistent with the original analysis, the updated analysis, based on the cut-off date of April 30, 2009, 
showed that ORR was greater in the combination arm.

Quality of Life 
Study BO17708 
Patients’ QoL was assessed using the self-reported FACT-B instrument as a secondary objective in 
study BO17708. In general, the results of the analyses utilizing different imputation rules to account 
for missing values consistently demonstrated relatively better QoL scores in those patients treated in 
the bevacizumab + docetaxel arm compared with the control arm.  
QoL was not measured in the other supportive studies (AVF3694g and MO19391). 
2.1.1.3.  Discussion on efficacy 
Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel 
The pivotal study E2100 was an open-label, randomised, two armed, phase III study comparing 
bevacizumab+paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel alone in the first line treatment of patients with metastatic 
breast cancer. This study was the definite pivotal study in the evalution of the benefit-risk balance for 
the paclitaxel-bevacizumab combination. 
In this study, the bevacizumab+paclitaxel arm exhibited an increase of 5.5 months in median 
progression-free survival compared to the paclitaxel alone arm (11.3 vs. 5.8 months, respectively; 
hazard ratio = 0.480, p<0.0001; based on IRC assessment).  
Assessment report for AVASTIN  
EMA/129129/2011  
Page 16/27
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall survival was not compromised (26.5 months for the combination vs. 24.8 months for paclitaxel 
alone, hazard ratio = 0.87 [95% CI 0.72, 1.05]; p=0.14). 
Overall response rate was 22.2% and 49.8% in the paclitaxel alone and bevacizumab+paclitaxel arms, 
respectively (p<0.0001). 
The data presented suggested an improvement in QoL for patients on the combination treatment, 
although the reliability of the scores can be questioned due to methodological limitations.  
The analysis of PFS in the subgroup of patients receiving nab-paclitaxel in study AVF3694g is 
consistent with a beneficial effect on PFS by combining bevacizumab with paclitaxel as observed in 
E2100. Although the 2.9 month difference between treatment arms is smaller than previously observed 
and not statistically significant (a likely consequence of the study not being powered to allow for 
subgroup comparison), a trend favouring the combination therapy was observed.  
In conclusion, the results of existing studies on the combination bevacizumab+paclitaxel are consistent 
and support a positive effect of therapy with a clear benefit to patients.   
Bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel 
The pivotal study BO17708 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III 
trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab+docetaxel vs. docetaxel alone, as first-line 
treatment for patients with HER2-negative metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer.  
In the updated analysis of this study, the bevacizumab+docetaxel arm exhibited an increase of 1.9 
months in median progression-free survival compared to the docetaxel alone arm (10.1 vs. 8.2 
months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.77, p=0.0061). This improvement of PFS was considered by 
CHMP, at the time of approval of the combination, to be very modest but nevertheless acceptable 
given that no clearly detrimental effect was seen in overall survival (HR = 1.03; p=0.8524) and that 
benefits could be expected in terms of quality of life.   
However there was a need to continue to follow-up the OS results to further reduce any uncertainties 
about a possible detrimental effect on OS, and therefore the CHMP requested for the full and final data 
to be submitted post authorisation. The updated results (cut-off date February 28, 2010) confirmed the 
primary analysis, in that no negative trend was seen in overall survival (31.7 months for the 
combination vs. 28.1 months for docetaxel alone, hazard ratio = 0.98 [95% CI 0.78, 1.23]; p=0.86), 
however there are uncertainties remaining in relation to this data due to the crossing of the curves at 
approximately 24 months and the fact that the end of the curves is unreliable due to heavy censoring.  
Overall response rate (cut-off date April 30, 2009) was 64.1% and 46.4% in the combination and 
docetaxel alone arms, respectively (p=0.0003). 
The data presented suggests an improvement in QoL for patients on the combination treatment, but 
the reliability of the scores is questionable due to methodological limitations. The only conclusion that 
can be drawn from the QoL data is that quality of life is not impaired by treatment. 
The only supportive study for the efficacy of the combination is AVF3694g. In this study, an extremely 
modest improvement in PFS (median 0.8 months; HR=0.78, p=0.17) was seen in the small subgroup 
of patients to whom the combination bevacizumab+docetacel was offered (n=123) when compared to 
the docetaxel alone subgroup (n=58). No QoL data was collected. 
Even less reassuring is the negative trend observed in the docetaxel+bevacizumab arm of AVF3694g 
for OS (HR=1.45, p=0.14). It is recognised that the results are not statistically significant, that the 
data concern a subgroup analysis in a small number of patients (n=181) and that patients in the 
control arm had better prognostic factors. However, the imbalances in prognostic factors between 
treatment arms were minor and are unlikely to be the explanation for the difference observed. It was 
argued by the MAH that the HR value may be the result of patients on the doxetaxel+placebo 
subgroup performing better than would be expected for the control group, particularly in comparison to 
study BO17708. However, when specifying key clinical subgroups within the docetaxel treated patients, 
no major contribution to the overall hazard ratio of 1.45 was identified.

In conclusion, the already very modest benefit observed in the pivotal trial BO17708 (median PFS 
improvement 1.9 months, no effect on OS) is further questioned by the results of the study AVF3694g. 
Although it is recognised that AVF3694g was not powered for subgroup comparison and that results of 
the bevacizumab+docetaxel combination should therefore be carefully considered, the extremely 
modest effect on PFS and the added uncertainty about OS in view of the negative trend observed 
cannot simply be ignored when such marginal benefit was shown in the pivotal study. These additional 
data raise the question as to whether this combination provides patients with any clinically significant 
benefit and whether the benefit outweighs the risks associated with the toxicity derived from the 
combination of bevacizumab+docetaxel. 
The better outcome of the combination of paclitaxel with bevacizumab than docetaxel in the treatment 
of metastatic breast cancer is difficult to explain. However, although the two taxanes have similar 
chemical structures and similar mechanisms of action, they are not identical or interchangeable. In 
general, docetaxel is reported to have a higher activity than paclitaxel and that may help explain why 
the addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel does not produce an effect of the same magnitude as it does 
for paclitaxel. 
2.1.2.  Clinical safety 
2.1.2.1.  Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel 
Adverse Events  
Study E2100 
Because the bevacizumab safety profile had been generated from prior large randomised clinical trials 
in solid tumours, only grade 3 non-haematologic and grade 4 haematologic AEs were collected in 
study E2100. Expedited reporting was not required for patients who received paclitaxel alone, thus 
introducing a bias in safety reporting favouring the control arm. 
Table 16 shows the incidence of selected AEs (defined as commonly associated with bevacizumab or 
weekly paclitaxel) reported. The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel resulted in adverse events that 
were predictable, based on previous bevacizumab experience, and clinically manageable. AEs of 
particular interest in patients treated with paclitaxel include sensory neuropathy, and neutropenia, and 
febrile neutropenia. An increased incidence of grade 3 sensory neuropathy was observed in the 
paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm (24.8% vs. 18.1% in the control arm). The observed difference was due 
to the longer treatment duration in the paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm compared with the paclitaxel 
alone arm, and an analysis adjusting for the duration of study treatment showed that the incidence of 
sensory neuropathy was similar after the adjustment.

The incidence of grade 3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia was increased in patients who received 
bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel. However, these events occurred at a relatively low 
incidence (10%) and were not associated with an increase in life-threatening events. Patients treated 
with paclitaxel + bevacizumab who developed neutropenia and those who developed infection received 
significantly more paclitaxel (median of 35 doses) than those who did not develop neutropenia or 
infection (median of 21 doses).  
The incidences of adverse events that have previously been associated with bevacizumab, including 
grade 3 hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, proteinuria, bleeding, GI perforation, and ATE 
events were increased in E2100 patients who received the combination of paclitaxel + bevacizumab, 
but were within the range of expected toxicity, both in terms of incidence and severity.  
As expected, there was a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 hypertension (16%) events among patients 
who received paclitaxel + bevacizumab than among those treated with paclitaxel alone (1.4%). Of the 
58 patients with an event of grade 3 or above hypertension, only 2 experienced a grade 4 event. There 
were no grade 5 events reported. The risk of left ventricular dysfunction was not increased above that 
described in studies of patients with previously treated mBC.  
Study AVF3694g 
The incidence of selected grade 3 AEs in the subset of patients treated with nab-paclitaxel in study 
AVF3694g is shown in table 17. The incidence rates observed are consistent with those observed in 
study E2100 with the exception of sensory neuropathy. Placebo-treated patients had a higher 
incidence of sensory neuropathy relative to bevacizumab-treated patients, potentially explained by the 
small sample size of this subset. As in study E2100, the incidence of grade 3 neutropenia and febrile 
neutropenia in the AVF3694g patients receiving nab-paclitaxel+bevacizumab was increased.

Study MO19391 
The open-label, single-arm Phase IV study MO19391 also provides supportive evidence regarding the 
safety of bevacizumab and taxanes. In this study, 779 patients were treated with paclitaxel + 
bevacizumab, and the safety data demonstrated that the safety profile of this combination in the 
postmarketing setting was consistent with the experience in the E2100 pivotal trial and clinical study 
experience. The most common grade 3 adverse events were hypertension (5.1%), proteinuria 
(3.6%), and arterial/venous thromboembolism (3.6%).  
Mortality 
Study E2100 
The majority of deaths in both treatment arms were due to the underlying mBC. A slightly increased 
number of deaths due to AE or protocol therapy (treatment-related mortality) were observed in the 
paclitaxel+bevacizumab arm compared with the paclitaxel alone arm (table 18). However the numbers 
were small and deaths with missing or unknown cause were more frequent in the paclitaxel only arm.

The combination of bevacizumab with nab-paclitaxel in study AVF3694g had similar mortality rates 
unrelated to disease progression relative to the control arm (table 19). Death due to other causes was 
more frequent in the nab-paclitaxel+bevacizumab arm than in the nab-paclitaxel only arm (5.0% vs.

Of the 779 patients in the safety population in the open-label single-arm trial MO19391 who were 
treated with paclitaxel+bevacizumab, 416 (53.4%) died. Cause of death was attributed to: breast 
cancer (49.6%), other reason (2.3%), unknown (0.8%), concurrent illness (0.2%), toxicity of 
chemotherapy (0.2%), and bevacizumab toxicity (0.2%). This data confirms what was seen in previous 
studies. 
2.1.2.2.  Bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel 
Adverse events 
Study BO17708 
In study BO17708, all adverse events of any severity were collected. For consistency in discussing the 
safety data from this study relative to the other trials, adverse events of grade  3 will be discussed. 
Docetaxel’s primary dose-limiting toxicities are neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Common non-
haematologic toxicities include alopecia, hypersensitivity, asthenia, fever without infection, infection, 
neuromotor and neurosensory toxicity, peripheral edema, pain, nail disorders, skin toxicity, and 
stomatitis.  
As expected, the most frequent grade  3 adverse events in both treatment arms were neutropenia 
and febrile neutropenia, and were increased in the bevacizumab+docetaxel arm by 2.5% and 4.9%, 
respectively, compared with the placebo+docetaxel arm. The palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome (PPE) rate was also increased by 6% in the bevacizumab+docetaxel arm relative to control. 
Increases were seen in other grade 3 non-haematologic toxicities associated with docetaxel: 
diarrhoea, fatigue, stomatitis, skin exfoliation, nail toxicity, and peripheral sensory neuropathy, all 
increased by less than 5% (table 20). The longer duration of treatment exposure in the Bv15 + Doc 
treatment arm compared with the control arm may have contributed to an increase in these events.

The rates of peripheral edema and infection were higher in the placebo+docetaxel arm than in the

Adverse events that were previously seen to have a higher incidence on bevacizumab treatment were 
reviewed (table 21). The following grade ≥3 bevacizumab-associated adverse events were similar 
(<2% difference or more frequent in the control arm) between both arms: thromboembolic events 
including venous and arterial events, bleeding including mucocutaneous and pulmonary events, GI 
perforation; abscess and fistula; wound-healing complication, proteinuria and LVSD. As expected, the 
rate of grade 3 hypertension was higher in the combination treatment arm than in the docetaxel only 
arm. There were no grade 5 hypertension events.

adverse events include febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, hypertension, and sensory neuropathy. 
However a relevant difference in rate of reporting of adverse events is noted (43.1% for the 
combination vs. 19% for the docetaxel only subgroup).

This open-label, single-arm, phase IV study also provides supportive evidence regarding safety of 
bevacizumab and taxanes. In this study, 741 patients were treated with docetaxel+bevacizumab. 
Overall, the safety data demonstrated that the safety profile of this combination in the postmarketing 
setting was consistent with the experience in the BO17708 pivotal study. The most common grade 3 or 
higher adverse events included haemorrhage: 2.3%, hypertension 5.1%, and thromboembolic events 
(both arterial and venous thromboembolic), 2.8%.

2.1.2.3.  Discussion on safety 
Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel 
In study E2100, only grades 3-5 haematological and grades 4-5 non-haematological adverse events 
were reported. The AEs observed with the combination arm are as would be expected from the 
knowledge of the safety profile of the two drugs. The most common, selected SAEs with a ≥ 2% 
difference in incidence between treatment arms, were sensory neuropathy (18.1% vs. 24.8%), 
hypertension (1.4% vs. 16%), infection (4.6% vs. 9.1%), neutropenia (4.0% vs. 8.0%) and arterial 
thromboembolic events (0% vs. 3.6%) for paclitaxel alone and for the bevacizumab combination, 
respectively.  
The majority of deaths in both treatment arms were due to mBC. There was a greater incidence of 
deaths due to AEs or protocol therapy in the paclitaxel + bevacizumab treatment arm (1.7%) 
compared to the paclitaxel alone arm (0.3%), but deaths with missing or unknown cause was more 
frequent in the paclitaxel arm. 
The safety data for the nab-paclitaxel subgroup of study AVF3694g revealed a pattern very similar to 
what was seen in study E2100. As expected, more common and severe AEs were observed in the 
combination arm, however there were no new or unexpected findings. Most AEs are manageable, 
although life-threatening and even fatal complications occur in a small number of patients. 
In the phase IV study (MO19391) 779 patients were treated with paclitaxel+bevacizumab and showed 
similar safety results with the most common grade ≥ 3 AEs being hypertension (5.1%), proteinuria 
(3.6%) and arterial/venous thromboembolisms (3.6%).

Bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel 
Added toxicity was observed in BO17708 for patients treated with the combination regimen but in 
general, the increase in individual incidence rates for selected, severe complications was relatively 
small. The largest differences between treatment arms were observed for febrile neutropenia (11.7% 
vs. 16.6%), diarrhea (3.4% vs. 6.9%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaestesia syndrome (0.9% vs. 6.9%), 
hypertension (1.3% vs. 4.5%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.3% vs. 7.7%) for docetaxel and 
docetal-bevacizumab treated patients, respectively. Overall, the data did not reveal any unexpected 
bevacizumab-related toxicities. No difference between treatment arms was observed in treatment 
related mortality. 
Data from studies AVF3694g and MO19391 are consistent with study BO17708 with regard to 
treatment related mortality. However, a relevant difference in rate of reporting of adverse events is 
noted (43.1% for the combination vs. 19% for the docetaxel only subgroup) and, in the docetaxel 
subgroup of study AVF3694g, there were more deaths due to mBC in the bevacizumab+docetaxel 
subgroup than in the docetaxel only treated patients.  
Selected adverse events, adverse events leading to study discontinuation and serious adverse events 
were more frequent in the bevacizumab subgroup but did not result in more treatment related deaths. 
No single toxicity in a system organ class appeared to contribute significantly to a greater morbidity. 
2.2.  Risk minimisation activities 
The Committee did not ask the MAH to submit an updated risk management plan as part of this 
review. 
2.3.  Product information 
The CHMP recommended the amendments to be introduced in sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the summary of 
product characteristics (SPC), in the conditions of the marketing authorisation section of the Annex II, 
and section 1 of the package leaflet. 
3.  Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
In view of the uncertainty around the existing data, the CHMP convened a meeting of the SAG 
oncology to address the question below: 
Based on the results of E2100, BO17708 (AVADO) and cohort 1 of AVF3694g (Ribbon-1), the SAG-O 
should discuss the clinical relevance and the Benefit/Risk balance for the following combinations in the 
1st line treatment of patients with mBC:  
  Bevacizumab + paclitaxel 
  Bevacizumab + docetaxel 
Concerning the combination of bevacizumab + paclitaxel, the SAG agreed that there are no new data 
to change the benefit-risk balance. The clinical relevance of the observed effect in terms of 
progression-free survival is not questioned, even in the absence of a clear effect on overall survival. 
Although the magnitude of the effect observed in the bevacizumab+abraxane subgroup of AVF3694g 
was smaller than that observed in E2100, this combination is of limited relevance due to the different 
types of agents. In conclusion, based on the additional data from AVF3694g, the benefit-risk balance of 
bevacizumab + paclitaxel is unchanged. 
Concerning the combination of bevacizumab + docetaxel, the SAG agreed that based on the additional 
data from AVF3694g, there are no new data to change the benefit-risk balance. The SAG agreed that 
in principle the effect observed in terms of PFS for bevacizumab + docetaxel was very modest but still 
clinically relevant. Although this is largely based on expert clinical judgement, the effect in terms of 
PFS and ORR is expected to be associated with benefits in terms of symptom control.  
The SAG, however, continues to have different views on the need for further data to rule out a possible 
adverse effect in terms of OS (as already expressed in the previous advice on this combination).

According to some experts, the available data in terms of PFS objective response and OS were 
sufficient. According to other experts further data on OS are needed to rule out a detrimental effect 
conclusively. This was considered particularly important because it is possible that anti-angiogenesis 
agents combinations with chemotherapy may alter the mechanisms and patterns of recurrence. The 
SAG agreed that the apparent negative trend in OS observed in the bevacizumab + docetaxel 
subgroup in the AVF3694g trial does not raise particular concerns because the statistical evidence for 
this effect is small and this is probably a chance finding. 
All SAG members agreed that the best way to provide convincing additional efficacy data in the 
approved indications in first-line breast cancer should be to conduct trials based on biomarker data to 
select populations most likely to respond to bevacizumab. Although interesting exploratory findings are 
available, confirmatory studies with biomarkers are lacking. Results from such studies are urgently 
needed. The company should be asked to commit to conduct such studies. 
Bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel 
In the pivotal study E2100, the bevacizumab+paclitaxel arm exhibited an increase of 5.5 months in 
median progression-free survival compared to the paclitaxel alone arm (11.3 vs. 5.8 months, 
respectively; hazard ratio = 0.480, p<0.0001; based on IRC assessment). Overall survival was not 
compromised (26.5 months for the combination vs. 24.8 months for paclitaxel alone, hazard ratio = 
0.87 [95% CI 0.72, 1.05]; p=0.14). Overall response rate was 22.2% and 49.8% in the paclitaxel 
alone and bevacizumab+paclitaxel arms, respectively (p<0.0001). The data presented suggested an 
improvement in QoL for patients on the combination treatment, although the reliability of the scores 
can be questioned.  
The analysis of PFS in the subgroup of patients receiving nab-paclitaxel in study AVF3694g is 
consistent with a beneficial effect on PFS by combining bevacizumab with paclitaxel as observed in 
E2100. Although the 2.9 month difference between treatment arms is smaller than previously observed 
and not statistically significant (a likely consequence of the study not being powered to allow for 
subgroup comparison), a trend favouring the combination therapy was observed.  
The safety data for the nab-paclitaxel subgroup of study AVF3694g revealed a pattern very similar to 
what was seen in study E2100. As expected more common and severe AEs were observed in the 
combination arm, however there were no new or unexpected findings. Most AEs are manageable, 
although life-threatening and even fatal complications occur in a small number of patients. 
In conclusion, the results of existing studies on the combination bevacizumab+paclitaxel are consistent 
and support a positive effect of therapy with a clear benefit to patients.   
Benefit/risk balance 
Taken this into account, the benefit/risk balance of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel for 
first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer is considered to be positive. 
Bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel 
In the pivotal study BO17708, the bevacizumab+docetaxel arm exhibited an increase of 1.9 months in 
median progression-free survival compared to the docetaxel alone arm (10.1 vs. 8.2 months, 
respectively; hazard ratio = 0.77, p=0.0061). This improvement of PFS was considered by CHMP, at 
the time of approval of the combination, to be very modest but nevertheless acceptable given that no 
clearly detrimental effect was seen in overall survival and that benefits could be expected in terms of 
quality of life.   
However there was a need to continue to follow-up the OS results to further reduce any uncertainties 
about a possible detrimental effect on OS, and therefore the CHMP requested for the full and final data 
to be submitted post authorisation. The updated results (cut-off date February 28, 2010) confirmed the 
primary analysis, in that no negative trend was seen in overall survival (31.7 months for the 
combination vs. 28.1 months for docetaxel alone, hazard ratio = 0.98 [95% CI 0.78, 1.23]; p=0.86), 
however there are uncertainties remaining in relation to this data due to the crossing of the curves at 
approximately 24 months and the fact that the end of the curves is unreliable due to heavy censoring.

The only supportive study for the efficacy of the combination is AVF3694g. In this study, an extremely 
modest improvement in PFS (median 0.8 months; HR=0.78, p=0.17) was seen in the small subgroup 
of patients to whom the combination bevacizumab+docetacel was offered when compared to the 
docetaxel alone subgroup.  
Even less reassuring is the negative trend observed in the docetaxel+bevacizumab arm of AVF3694g 
for OS (HR=1.45, p=0.14). It is recognised that the results are not statistically significant, that the 
data concern a subgroup analysis in a small number of patients (n=181) and that patients in the 
control arm had better prognostic factors. However, the imbalances in prognostic factors between 
treatment arms were minor and are unlikely to be the explanation for the difference observed. It was 
argued by the MAH that the HR value may be the result of patients on the doxetaxel+placebo 
subgroup performing better than would be expected for the control group, particularly in comparison to 
study BO17708. However, when specifying key clinical subgroups within the docetaxel treated patients, 
no major contribution to the overall hazard ratio of 1.45 was identified.  
In conclusion, the already very modest benefit observed in the pivotal trial BO17708 (median PFS 
improvement 1.9 months, no effect on overall survival) is further questioned by the results of the 
study AVF3694g. Although it is recognised that AVF3694g was not powered for subgroup comparison 
and that results of the bevacizumab+docetaxel combination should therefore be carefully considered, 
the extremely modest effect on PFS and the added uncertainty about OS in view of the negative trend 
observed cannot simply be ignored when such marginal benefit was shown in the pivotal study. These 
additional data raise the question as to whether this combination provides patients with any clinically 
significant benefit and whether the benefit outweighs the risks associated with the toxicity derived 
from the combination of bevacizumab+docetaxel. 
Added toxicity was observed in BO17708 for patients treated with the combination regimen but in 
general, the increase in individual incidence rates for selected, severe complications was relatively 
small. Overall, the data did not reveal any unexpected bevacizumab-related toxicities. No difference 
between treatment arms was observed in treatment related mortality.  
However, in study AVF3694g a relevant difference in rate of reporting of adverse events is noted 
(43.1% for the combination vs. 19% for the docetaxel only subgroup) and, in the docetaxel subset, 
there were more deaths due to mBC in the bevacizumab+docetaxel subgroup than in the docetaxel 
only treated patients. 
Benefit/risk balance 
In view of the available data, the Committee concluded that the insufficient effect shown in terms of 
improvement in progression-free survival associated to the fact that a potential detrimental effect on 
overall survival can not be ruled out, no longer outweigh the risk of increased toxicity of the 
combination of docetaxel and bevacizumab. 
Taken the above into account, the benefit/risk balance of bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel 
for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer is considered to be negative. 
During the Oral Explanation, the MAH presented information on an ongoing programme for the 
development of biomarkers that is expected to help identify the population most likely to benefit from 
treatment with Avastin for metastatic breast cancer. The MAH is therefore requested to commit to 
investigate suitable biomarkers (including VEGF-A) to allow identification and selection of a more 
targeted population of patients most likely to benefit from the combination of Avastin and paclitaxel in 
the treatment of first-line metastatic breast cancer. 
A report on the research programme should be submitted within 3 months of the Commission Decision. 
Progress reports should be submitted on a yearly basis. 
4.  Overall conclusion 
Having considered the overall submitted data provided by the MAHs in writing and in the oral 
explanation, the CHMP concluded that: 
- The benefit/risk balance of Avastin in combination with paclitaxel in the treatment of first-line 
metastatic breast cancer is positive. 
Assessment report for AVASTIN  
EMA/129129/2011

- The benefit/risk balance of Avastin in combination with docetaxel in the treatment of first-line 
metastatic breast cancer is not positive. 
Therefore, the CHMP recommended the amendment to the terms of the marketing authorisation for 
Avastin, for which the revised summary of product characteristics, conditions of the marketing 
authorisation and package leaflet are set out respectively in annexes I, II and IIIB of the opinion. 
5.  Conclusion and grounds for the recommendation 
 
 
 
The Committee reviewed all available data on the combination of either paclitaxel or docetaxel with 
bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.  
The Committee considered that the combination of paclitaxel with bevacizumab results in an 
improvement in terms of median progression-free survival which is considered clinically relevant. 
The Committee also considered that the results from the AVF3694g study support this conclusion. 
The Committee is of the opinion that for the combination of docetaxel and bevacizumab compared 
to docetaxel alone only a very modest improvement in progression-free survival was seen, which 
at the time of the initial approval was considered acceptable given that the data did not indicate a 
detrimental effect on overall survival. 
  However, the Committee reviewed the new data from the AVF3694g study on the combination 
docetaxel and bevacizumab, and found that the improvement in PFS was considerably lower than 
seen at the time of approval of the combination, and below the limit of clinical significance. In 
addition, the Committee concluded that there is added uncertainty on the effect of the combination 
on overall survival, therefore a potential detrimental effect can no longer be ruled out.  
 
Therefore, in view of the available data, the Committee concluded that the insufficient effect shown 
in terms of improvement in progression-free survival associated to the fact that a potential 
detrimental effect on overall survival can not be ruled out, no longer outweigh the risk of increased 
toxicity of the combination of docetaxel and bevacizumab.   
The Committee, as a consequence, concluded that the benefit/risk balance of bevacizumab in 
combination with docetaxel for the treatment of first-line metastatic breast cancer is not positive under 
normal conditions of use. Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that the related indication should be 
deleted. 
The Committee also concluded that the benefit/risk balance of bevacizumab in combination with 
paclitaxel for the treatment of first-line metastatic breast cancer remains positive under normal 
conditions of use. 
The CHMP has therefore recommended the variation of the marketing authorisation for Avastin and the 
amendment of the Product Information as set out in an annex I, II and IIIB to this opinion.

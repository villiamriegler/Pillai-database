are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

of adverse reactions and extension of the safety 
dataset. Changes were also proposed to bring this 
section in line with the EU SmPC guideline. The 
Package leaflet has been updated accordingly. The 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) also proposed 
updates throughout the product information in line 
with the QRD template version 7.3.1 and the EU 
Guideline on Excipients including addition of 
information on the influence on human fertility to 
section 4.6 of the SmPC, a correction with regard to 
sodium chloride being an ingredient of the solvent 
and a warning in section 4.4 that the container of 
this medicinal product contains latex rubber. Editorial 
changes were also proposed throughout the product 
information. The MAH also took the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives in the 
package leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications

IB/0021/G 
This was an application for a group of variations. 
01/07/2011 
n/a 
The study design, doses, treatment duration and patient 
population in these studies were considered by the MAH to 
be comparable to the studies in the approved indication 
soft tissue sarcoma, which previously served as the basis 
for estimation of frequency categories. Reports of all 
studies had been provided in the original Marketing 
Authorisation Application for Beromun. 
Four new undesirable effects were identified which, 
however, in their underlying genesis did not fundamentally 
differ from the already known side effects (Abdominal pain 
upper, gastritis erosive, blood creatinine increased and 
pulmonary oedema). The extension of the reference study 
data as well as the change in methodology applied to 
frequency calculation resulted in a change in the frequency 
category for six previously listed undesirable effects.  
As a result of the changes described above, a complete 
revision and restructuring following the recommendations 
of the EU SmPC guideline was proposed for this section.

on the basis of the re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance,

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Beromun 
continues to the favourable. The CHMP is also of the 
opinion that the renewal can be granted with unlimited 
validity. PSURs will now be submitted every 3 years.

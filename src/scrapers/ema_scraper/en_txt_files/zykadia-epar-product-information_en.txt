“LDK 150MG” imprinted on the cap and “NVR” on the body, containing white to almost white 
powder. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Zykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Zykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with 
crizotinib. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with ceritinib should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anti-cancer medicinal products. 
ALK testing 
An accurate and validated ALK assay is necessary for the selection of ALK-positive NSCLC patients 
(see section 5.1). 
ALK-positive NSCLC status should be established prior to initiation of ceritinib therapy. Assessment 
for ALK-positive NSCLC should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the 
specific technology being utilised.

Posology 
The recommended dose of ceritinib is 450 mg taken orally once daily with food at the same time each 
day. 
The maximum recommended dose with food is 450 mg taken orally once daily. Treatment should 
continue as long as clinical benefit is observed. 
If a dose is missed, the patient should make up that dose, unless the next dose is due within 12 hours. 
If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, the patient should not take an additional dose, but 
should continue with the next scheduled dose. 
Ceritinib should be discontinued in patients unable to tolerate 150 mg daily taken with food. 
Dose adjustment due to adverse reactions 
Temporary dose interruption and/or dose reduction of ceritinib may be required based on individual 
safety and tolerability. If dose reduction is required due to an adverse drug reaction (ADR) not listed 
in Table 1, then this should be achieved by decrements of 150 mg daily. Early identification and 
management of ADRs with standard supportive care measures should be considered. 
In patients treated with ceritinib 450 mg with food, 24.1% of patients had an adverse event that 
required at least one dose reduction and 55.6% of patients had an adverse event that required at least 
one dose interruption. The median time to first dose reduction due to any reason was 9.7 weeks. 
Table 1 summarises recommendations for dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation of ceritinib 
in the management of selected ADRs.

Lipase or amylase elevation grade ≥3 
Withhold ceritinib until recovery to asymptomatic 
(grade ≤1) bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 beats 
per minute (bpm) or above. 
Evaluate concomitant medicinal products known to 
cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive 
medicinal products. 
If a contributing concomitant medicinal product is 
identified and discontinued, or its dose is adjusted, 
reinitiate ceritinib at the previous dose upon 
recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart 
rate of 60 bpm or above. 
If no contributing concomitant medicinal product is 
identified, or if contributing concomitant medicinal 
products are not discontinued or dose modified, 
reinitiate ceritinib with dose reduced by 150 mg 
upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a 
heart rate of 60 bpm or above. 
Permanently discontinue ceritinib if no contributing 
concomitant medicinal product is identified. 
If a contributing concomitant medicinal product is

heart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent 
monitoringb. 
Withhold ceritinib until hyperglycaemia is 
adequately controlled, then reinitiate ceritinib with 
dose reduced by 150 mg. 
If adequate glucose control cannot be achieved with 
optimal medical management, permanently

Heart rate less than 60 beats per minutes (bpm) 
Permanently discontinue in the event of recurrence 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided (see section 4.5). If concomitant use 
of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, the dose of ceritinib should be reduced by approximately 
one third (dose not clinically verified), rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dose strength. 
Patients should be carefully monitored for safety. 
If long-term concomitant treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is necessary and the patient 
tolerates the reduced dose well, the dose may be increased again with careful monitoring for safety, to 
avoid potential under-treatment. 
After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume at the dose that was taken prior to initiating 
the strong CYP3A inhibitor.

CYP3A substrates 
When ceritinib is co-administered with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) for the other product must be consulted for the recommendations regarding 
co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Co-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP3A or CYP3A substrates 
known to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, ciclosporin, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lovastatin, simvastatin, 
sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus) should be avoided and 
alternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible. 
If unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with 
narrow therapeutic indices should be considered. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted. 
However, based on available data, ceritinib elimination via the kidney is negligible. Therefore, no dose 
adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution should be used in 
patients with severe renal impairment, as there is no experience with ceritinib in this population (see 
section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on available data, ceritinib is eliminated primarily via the liver. Particular caution should be 
exercised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment and the dose should be reduced by 
approximately one third, rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dose strength (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
Elderly (≥65 years) 
The limited data on the safety and efficacy of ceritinib in patients aged 65 years and older do not 
suggest that a dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). There are no available 
data on patients over 85 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ceritinib in children and adolescents aged up to 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Ceritinib is for oral use. The capsules should be administered orally once daily with food at the same 
time every day. It is important that ceritinib is taken with food to reach the appropriate exposure. Food 
can range from a light to a full meal (see section 5.2). The capsules should be swallowed whole with 
water and should not be chewed or crushed. 
For patients who develop a concurrent medical condition and are unable to take ceritinib with food 
please refer to section 4.5. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatotoxicity 
Cases of hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving ceritinib in clinical studies. Increases to 
grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients. The majority of cases were 
manageable with dose interruption and/or dose reduction. Few events required discontinuation of 
treatment. 
Patients should be monitored with liver laboratory tests (including ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior 
to the start of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first three months of treatment and monthly 
thereafter. In patients who develop transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver 
transaminases and total bilirubin should be carried out as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8). Particular caution should be exercised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, and 
the dose should be adjusted (see section 4.2). Limited experience in these patients showed a worsening 
of the underlying condition (hepatic encephalopathy) in 2 out of 10 patients exposed to 750 mg single 
doses of ceritinib under fasted conditions (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). Other factors apart from study 
treatment could have impacted on observed events of hepatic encephalopathy, however, the relation 
between study treatment and events cannot be fully ruled out. No dose adjustment is necessary in 
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). 
Interstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis 
Severe, life-threatening or fatal ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in patients treated with ceritinib 
in clinical studies. Most of these severe/life-threatening cases improved or resolved with interruption 
of treatment. 
Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Other potential 
causes of ILD/pneumonitis should be excluded, and ceritinib should be permanently discontinued in 
patients diagnosed with any grade treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
QT interval prolongation 
QTc prolongation has been observed in clinical studies in patients treated with ceritinib (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.2), which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. 
torsade de pointes) or sudden death. 
Use of ceritinib in patients with congenital long QT syndrome should be avoided. The benefits and 
potential risks of ceritinib should be considered before beginning therapy in patients who have 
pre-existing bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 beats per minute [bpm]), patients who have a history 
of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, patients who are taking anti-arrhythmics or other medicinal 
products that are known to prolong the QT interval and patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac 
disease and/or electrolyte disturbances. Periodic monitoring with ECGs and periodic monitoring of 
electrolytes (e.g. potassium) is recommended in these patients. In the event of vomiting, diarrhoea, 
dehydration or impaired renal function, correct electrolytes as clinically indicated. Ceritinib should be 
permanently discontinued in patients who develop QTc >500 msec or >60 msec change from baseline 
and torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious 
arrhythmia. Ceritinib should be withheld in patients who develop QTc >500 msec on at least two 
separate ECGs until recovery to baseline or a QTc ≤480 msec, then reinitiated with dose reduced by 
150 mg (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2).

Bradycardia 
Asymptomatic cases of bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) have been observed in 21 out of 
925 (2.3%) patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies. 
Use of ceritinib in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia (e.g. beta blockers, 
non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine and digoxin) should be avoided as far as 
possible. Heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored regularly. In cases of symptomatic 
bradycardia that is not life-threatening, ceritinib should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic 
bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, the use of concomitant medicinal products should be 
evaluated and the ceritinib dose adjusted if necessary. In the event of life-threatening bradycardia 
ceritinib should be permanently discontinued if no contributing concomitant medicinal product is 
identified; however, if associated with a concomitant medicinal product known to cause bradycardia or 
hypotension, ceritinib should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate 
of 60 bpm or above. If the concomitant medicinal product can be adjusted or discontinued, ceritinib 
should be reinitiated with dose reduced by 150 mg on recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a 
heart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent monitoring (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting occurred in 76.9% of 108 patients treated with ceritinib at the 
recommended dose of 450 mg taken with food in a dose optimisation study and were mainly grade 1 
(52.8%) and grade 2 (22.2%) events. Two patients (1.9%) experienced one grade 3 event each 
(diarrhoea and vomiting respectively). Nine patients (8.3%) required study drug interruption due to 
diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting. One patient (0.9%) required dose adjustment due to vomiting. In the 
same study, the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions were higher for 
patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg fasted (diarrhoea 80.0%, nausea 60.0%, vomiting 65.5%; 17.3% 
reported a grade 3 event) compared to 450 mg with food (diarrhoea 59.3%, nausea 42.6%, vomiting 
38.0%; 1.9% reported a grade 3 event). 
In the 450 mg with food and 750 mg fasted arms of this dose optimisation study, no patients required 
discontinuation of ceritinib due to diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored and managed using standards of care, including anti-diarrhoeals, 
anti-emetics or fluid replacement, as clinically indicated. Dose interruption and dose reduction should 
be employed as necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, 
the patient should not take an additional dose, but should continue with the next scheduled dose. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Cases of hyperglycaemia (all grades) have been reported in less than 10% of patients treated with 
ceritinib in clinical studies; grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia was reported in 5.4% of patients. The risk of 
hyperglycaemia was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or concurrent steroid use. 
Patients should be monitored for fasting plasma glucose prior to the start of ceritinib treatment and 
periodically thereafter as clinically indicated. Anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products should be 
initiated or optimised as indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Lipase and/or amylase elevations 
Elevations of lipase and/or amylase have occurred in patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies. 
Patients should be monitored for lipase and amylase elevations prior to the start of ceritinib treatment 
and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Cases of pancreatitis have 
been reported in patients treated with ceritinib (see section 4.8).

Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Agents that may increase ceritinib plasma concentrations 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 450 mg fasted ceritinib dose with ketoconazole 
(200 mg twice daily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor, resulted in 2.9-fold and 1.2-fold 
increase in ceritinib AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone. The 
steady-state AUC of ceritinib at reduced doses after co-administration with ketoconazole 200 mg 
twice daily for 14 days was predicted by simulations to be similar to the steady-state AUC of ceritinib 
alone. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided during treatment with ceritinib. 
If it is not possible to avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited 
to, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and 
nefazodone), the dose of ceritinib should be reduced by approximately one third, rounded to the 
nearest multiple of the 150 mg dose strength. After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, 
ceritinib should be resumed at the dose that was taken prior to initiating the strong CYP3A inhibitor. 
P-gp inhibitors 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). If 
ceritinib is administered with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp, an increase in ceritinib 
concentration is likely. Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors and 
ADRs carefully monitored. 
Agents that may decrease ceritinib plasma concentrations 
Strong CYP3A and P-gp inducers 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 750 mg fasted ceritinib dose with rifampicin (600 mg 
daily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inducer, resulted in 70% and 44% decreases in ceritinib 
AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone. Co-administration of 
ceritinib with strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers decreases ceritinib plasma concentrations. Concomitant 
use of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided; this includes, but is not limited to, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). Caution 
should be exercised with concomitant use of P-gp inducers. 
Agents that affect gastric pH 
Ceritinib demonstrates pH-dependent solubility and becomes poorly soluble as pH increases in vitro. 
Acid reducing agents (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids) can alter the 
solubility of ceritinib and reduce its bioavailability. Co-administration of a single 750 mg fasted 
ceritinib dose with a proton pump inhibitor (esomeprazole) 40 mg daily for 6 days in healthy, fasting 
subjects decreased ceritinib AUC by 76% and Cmax by 79%. The drug-drug interaction study was 
designed to observe the impact of proton pump inhibitor in the worst scenario, but in clinical use the 
impact of proton pump inhibitor on ceritinib exposure appears to be less pronounced. A dedicated 
study to evaluate the effect of gastric acid-reducing agents on the bioavailability of ceritinib under 
steady state has not been conducted. Caution is advised with concomitant use of proton pump 
inhibitors, as exposure of ceritinib may be reduced. There is no data with concomitant use of H2 
blockers or antacids. However, the risk for a clinically relevant decrease in bioavailability of ceritinib 
is possibly lower with concomitant use of H2 blockers if they are administered 10 hours before or 
2 hours after the ceritinib dose, and with antacids if they are administered 2 hours before or 2 hours 
after the ceritinib dose.

Agents whose plasma concentration may be altered by ceritinib 
CYP3A and CYP2C9 substrates 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib competitively inhibits the metabolism of a CYP3A substrate, 
midazolam, and a CYP2C9 substrate, diclofenac. Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A was also 
observed. 
Ceritinib has been classified in vivo as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and has the potential to interact with 
medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, which may lead to increased serum 
concentrations of the other product. Co-administration of a single dose of midazolam (a sensitive 
CYP3A substrate) following 3 weeks of ceritinib dosing in patients (750 mg daily fasted) increased 
the midazolam AUCinf (90% CI) by 5.4-fold (4.6, 6.3) compared to midazolam alone. 
Co-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP3A or CYP3A substrates 
known to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, ciclosporin, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lovastatin, simvastatin, 
sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus) should be avoided and 
alternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible. 
If unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with 
narrow therapeutic indices should be considered. 
Ceritinib has been classified in vivo as a weak CYP2C9 inhibitor. Co-administration of a single dose 
of warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) following 3 weeks of ceritinib dosing in patients (750 mg daily 
fasted) increased the S-warfarin AUCinf (90% CI) by 54% (36%, 75%) compared to warfarin alone. 
Co-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 or CYP2C9 
substrates known to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. phenytoin and warfarin) should be avoided. 
If unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP2C9 substrates 
with narrow therapeutic indices should be considered. Increasing the frequency of international 
normalised ratio (INR) monitoring may be considered if co-administration with warfarin is 
unavoidable. 
CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 substrates 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib also inhibits CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Therefore, ceritinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of 
co-administered medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by these enzymes. Caution 
should be exercised with concomitant use of CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 substrates and ADRs carefully 
monitored. 
A risk for induction of other PXR regulated enzymes apart from CYP3A4 cannot be completely 
excluded. The effectiveness of concomitant administration of oral contraceptives may be reduced. 
Agents that are substrates of transporters 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib does not inhibit apical efflux transporter MRP2, hepatic uptake 
transporters OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, renal organic anion uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3, or the 
organic cation uptake transporters OCT1 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, 
clinical drug-drug interactions as a result of ceritinib-mediated inhibition of substrates for these 
transporters are unlikely to occur. Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-gp 
and BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, ceritinib may have the potential to increase 
plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products transported by these proteins. Caution 
should be exercised with concomitant use of BCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin, topotecan, 
sulfasalazine) and P-gp substrates (digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine, pravastatin) and ADRs carefully 
monitored. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
In clinical studies, QT prolongation was observed with ceritinib. Therefore, ceritinib should be used 
with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT interval, including those 
patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products such as class I (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, 
disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) anti-arrhythmics or other 
medicinal products that may lead to QT prolongation such as domperidone, droperidol, chloroquine, 
halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, cisapride and moxifloxacin. Monitoring of the 
QT interval is indicated in the event of combinations of such medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
Food/drink interactions 
Ceritinib should be taken with food. The bioavailability of ceritinib is increased in the presence of 
food. 
For patients who develop a concurrent medical condition and are unable to take ceritinib with food, 
ceritinib can be taken on an empty stomach as the alternate continued treatment regimen, in which no 
food should be eaten for at least two hours before and one hour after the dose. Patients should not 
alternate between fasted and fed dosing. Dose must be adjusted properly, i.e for patients treated with 
450 mg or 300 mg with food, the dose should be increased to 750 mg or 450 mg taken on an empty 
stomach, respectively (see section 5.2) and for patients treated with 150 mg with food treatment 
should be discontinued. For subsequent dose adjustment and management recommendations for 
ADRs, please follow table 1 (see section 4.2). The maximum allowable dose under fasted condition is 
750 mg (see section 5.2). 
Patients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they may inhibit CYP3A in the 
gut wall and may increase the bioavailability of ceritinib. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use a highly effective method of contraception 
while taking ceritinib and for up to 3 months after discontinuing treatment (see section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of ceritinib in pregnant women. 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Ceritinib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with ceritinib. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ceritinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infant 
cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
ceritinib therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman (see section 5.3). 
Fertility 
The potential for ceritinib to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Zykadia has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Caution should be exercised 
when driving or using machines during treatment as patients may experience fatigue or vision 
disorders. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) described below reflect exposure to ceritinib 750 mg once daily fasted 
in 925 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC across a pool of seven clinical studies including 
two randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 studies (studies A2301 and A2303). 
The median duration of exposure to ceritinib 750 mg fasted was 44.9 weeks (range: 0.1 to 
200.1 weeks). 
ADRs with an incidence of ≥10% in patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg fasted were diarrhoea, 
nausea, vomiting, fatigue, liver laboratory test abnormalities, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, 
weight decreased, constipation, blood creatinine increased, rash, anaemia and oesophageal disorder. 
Grade 3-4 ADRs with an incidence of ≥5% in patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg fasted were liver 
laboratory test abnormalities, fatigue, vomiting, hyperglycaemia, nausea and diarrhoea. 
In the dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in both previously treated and untreated patients 
with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, the overall safety profile of ceritinib at the recommended dose 
of 450 mg with food (N=108) was consistent with ceritinib 750 mg fasted (N=110), except for a 
reduction in gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions, while achieving comparable steady-state exposure 
(see section 5.1 and subsection ‘Gastrointestinal adverse reactions’ below). 
Tabulated list of ADRs 
Table 2 shows the frequency category of ADRs reported for ceritinib in patients treated at a dose of 
750 mg fasted (N=925) in seven clinical studies. The frequency of selected gastrointestinal ADRs 
(diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) are based on patients treated with a dose of 450 mg once-daily with 
food (N=108). 
ADRs are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the ADRs 
are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding 
frequency category using the following convention (CIOMS III) is also provided for each ADR: very 
common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within 
each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Elderly (≥65 years) 
Across seven clinical studies, 168 out of 925 patients (18.2%) treated with ceritinib were aged 
65 years or older. The safety profile in patients aged 65 years or older was similar to that in patients 
less than 65 years of age (see section 4.2). There are no safety data in patients older than 85 years of 
age. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Concurrent elevations of ALT or AST greater than 3× ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN 
without elevated alkaline phosphatase have been observed in less than 1% of patients in clinical 
studies with ceritinib. Increases to grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients 
receiving ceritinib. Hepatotoxicity events were managed with dose interruptions or reductions in 
40.6% of patients. 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of treatment in clinical studies 
with ceritinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Liver laboratory tests including ALT, AST and total bilirubin should be performed prior to the start of 
treatment, every 2 weeks during the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter, with more 
frequent testing for grade 2, 3 or 4 elevations. Patients should be monitored for liver laboratory test 
abnormalities and managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were among the most commonly reported gastrointestinal events. In 
the dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in both previously treated and untreated patients 
with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC at the recommended dose of ceritinib 450 mg taken with food 
(N=108), adverse events of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were mainly grade 1 (52.8%) and grade 2 
(22.2%). Grade 3 events of diarrhoea and vomiting were each reported in two different patients 
(1.9%). Gastrointestinal events were managed primarily with concomitant medicinal products 
including anti-emetic/anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products. Nine patients (8.3%) required study drug 
interruption due to diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting. One patient (0.9%) required dose adjustment. In the 
450 mg with food and 750 mg fasted arms, no patients had diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting that 
required discontinuation of study drug. In the same study the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal 
adverse drug reactions were reduced for patients treated with ceritinib 450 mg with food (diarrhoea 
59.3%, nausea 42.6%, vomiting 38.0%; 1.9% reported a grade 3 event) compared to 750 mg fasted 
(diarrhoea 80.0%, nausea 60.0%, vomiting 65.5%; 17.3% reported a grade 3 event). Patients should be 
managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
QT interval prolongation 
QTc prolongation has been observed in patients treated with ceritinib. Across the seven clinical 
studies, 9.7% of patients treated with ceritinib had events of QT prolongation (any grade), including 
grade 3 or 4 events in 2.1% of patients. These events required dose reduction or interruption in 2.1% 
of patients and led to discontinuation in 0.2% of patients. 
Treatment with ceritinib is not recommended in patients who have congenital long QT syndrome or 
who are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Particular care should be exercised when administering ceritinib to patients with an increased risk of 
experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging medicinal product. 
Patients should be monitored for QT prolongation and managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 
4.4. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bradycardia 
Across the seven clinical studies, bradycardia and/or sinus bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) 
events (all grade 1) were reported in 2.3% of patients. These events required dose reduction or 
interruption in 0.2% of patients. None of these events led to discontinuation of ceritinib treatment. The 
use of concomitant medicinal products associated with bradycardia should be carefully evaluated. 
Patients who develop symptomatic bradycardia should be managed as recommended in sections 4.2 
and 4.4. 
Interstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis 
Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have been observed in 
patients treated with ceritinib. Across the seven clinical studies, any grade ILD/pneumonitis has been 
reported in 2.1% of patients treated with ceritinib, and grade 3 or 4 events have been reported in 1.2% 
of patients. These events required dose reduction or interruption in 1.1% of patients and led to 
discontinuation in 0.9% of patients. Patients with pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis 
should be monitored. Other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis should be excluded (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4). 
Hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia (all grades) was reported in 9.4% of patients treated with ceritinib across the seven 
clinical studies; grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 5.4% of patients. These events required dose 
reduction or interruption in 1.4% of patients and led to discontinuation in 0.1% of patients. The risk of 
hyperglycaemia was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or concurrent steroid use. 
Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is required prior to the start of ceritinib treatment and periodically 
thereafter as clinically indicated. Administration of anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products should be 
initiated or optimised as indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no reported experience with overdose in humans. General supportive measures should be 
initiated in all cases of overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, 
ATC code: L01ED02. 
Mechanism of action 
Ceritinib is an orally highly selective and potent ALK inhibitor. Ceritinib inhibits autophosphorylation 
of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signalling proteins and proliferation of 
ALK-dependent cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ALK translocation determines expression of the resulting fusion protein and consequent aberrant ALK 
signaling in NSCLC. In the majority of NSCLC cases, EML4 is the translocation partner for ALK; this 
generates an EML4-ALK fusion protein containing the protein kinase domain of ALK fused to the 
N-terminal part of EML4. Ceritinib was demonstrated to be effective against EML4-ALK activity in a 
NSCLC cell line (H2228), resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and regression of 
tumours in H2228-derived xenografts in mouse and rat. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Previously untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC - randomised phase 3 Study A2301 (ASCEND-4) 
The efficacy and safety of ceritinib for the treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC patients who 
have not received previous systemic treatment anti-cancer therapy (including ALK inhibitor) with the 
exception of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy, was demonstrated in a global multicentre, randomised, 
open-label phase 3 Study A2301. 
A total of 376 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by WHO performance status, prior 
adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and presence/absence of brain metastasis at screening) to receive 
either ceritinib (750 mg daily, fasted) or chemotherapy (based on investigator’s choice - pemetrexed 
[500 mg/m2] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m2] or carboplatin [AUC 5-6], administered every 21 days). 
Patients who completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy (induction) without progressive disease 
subsequently received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) as single-agent maintenance therapy every 21 days. 
One hundred and eighty-nine (189) patients were randomised to ceritinib and one hundred eighty-
seven (187) were randomised to chemotherapy. 
The median age was 54 years (range: 22 to 81 years); 78.5% of patients were younger than 65 years. A 
total of 57.4% of patients were female. 53.7% of the study population was Caucasian, 42.0% Asian, 
1.6% Black and 2.6% other races The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (96.5%) and had either 
never smoked or were former smokers (92.0%). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status was 0/1/2 in 37.0%/56.4%/6.4% of patients, and 32.2% had brain metastasis at 
baseline. 59.5% of patients with brain metastasis at baseline received no prior radiotherapy to the 
brain. Patients with symptomatic CNS (central nervous system) metastases who were neurologically 
unstable or had required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to screening to manage 
CNS symptoms, were excluded from the study. 
Patients were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond initial progression in case of 
continued clinical benefit as per the investigator's opinion. Patients randomised to the chemotherapy 
arm could cross-over to receive ceritinib upon RECIST-defined disease progression confirmed by 
blinded independent review committee (BIRC). One hundred and five (105) patients out of the 
145 patients (72.4%) that discontinued treatment in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent ALK 
inhibitor as first antineoplastic therapy. Of these patients 81 received ceritinib. 
The median duration of follow-up was 19.7 months (from randomisation to cut-off date). 
The study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in 
progression free survival (PFS) by BIRC (see Table 3 and Figure 1). The PFS benefit of ceritinib was 
consistent by investigator assessment and across various subgroups including age, gender, race, 
smoking class, ECOG performance status and disease burden. 
The overall survival (OS) data was not mature with 107 deaths representing approximately 42.3% of 
the required events for the final OS analysis. 
Efficacy data from Study A2301 are summarised in Table 3, and the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and 
OS are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.

Patient reported outcome questionnaires (Lung cancer symptom scale [LCSS], EORTC-QLQ-C30 
[C30], EORTC QLQ-LC13 [LC13] and EQ-5D-5L) were completed by 80% or more of patients in the 
ceritinib and chemotherapy arms for all questionnaires at most of the time-points during the course of 
the study. 
Ceritinib significantly prolonged time to deterioration for the pre-specified lung cancer specific 
symptoms of interest of cough, pain and dyspnoea (composite endpoint LCSS: HR=0.61, 95% CI: 
0.41, 0.90, median Time to Deterioration [TTD] NE [95% CI: 20.9, NE] in the ceritinib arm versus 
18.4 months [13.9, NE] in the chemotherapy arm; LC13: HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.69, median TTD 
23.6 months [95% CI: 20.7, NE] in the ceritinib arm versus 12.6 months [95% CI: 8.9, 14.9] in the 
chemotherapy arm). 
Patients receiving ceritinib showed significant improvements over chemotherapy in general Quality of 
Life and global Health Status measures (LCSS [p<0.001], QLQ-C30, [p<0.001] and EQ-5D-5L index 
[p<0.001]). 
In Study A2301, 44 patients with measurable brain metastasis at baseline and at least one post-baseline 
brain radiological assessment (22 patients in the ceritinib arm and 22 patients in the chemotherapy 
arm) were assessed for intracranial response by BIRC neuro-radiologist per modified RECIST 1.1 (i.e. 
up to 5 lesions in the brain). The overall intracranial response rate (OIRR) was higher with ceritinib 
(72.7%, 95% CI: 49.8, 89.3) as compared to the chemotherapy arm (27.3%, 95% CI: 10.7, 50.2). 
The median PFS by BIRC using RECIST 1.1 was longer in the ceritinib arm compared to the 
chemotherapy arm in both subgroups of patients with brain metastases and without brain metastases. 
The median PFS in patients with brain metastases was 10.7 months (95% CI: 8.1, 16.4) versus 
6.7 months (95% CI: 4.1, 10.6) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively, with HR=0.70 
(95% CI: 0.44, 1.12). The median PFS in patients without brain metastases was 26.3 months (95% CI: 
15.4, 27.7) versus 8.3 months (95% CI: 6.0, 13.7) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, 
respectively, with HR=0.48 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.69).

Previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC - randomised phase 3 Study A2303 (ASCEND-5) 
The efficacy and safety of ceritinib for the treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients who 
have received previous treatment with crizotinib, was demonstrated in a global multicentre, 
randomised, open-label phase 3 Study A2303. 
A total of 231 patients with advanced ALK positive NSCLC who have received prior treatment with 
crizotinib and chemotherapy (one or two regimen including a platinum-based doublet) were included 
in the analysis. One hundred fifteen (115) patients were randomised to ceritinib and one hundred 
sixteen (116) were randomised to chemotherapy (either pemetrexed or docetaxel). Seventy-three (73) 
patients received docetaxel and 40 received pemetrexed. In the ceritinib arm, 115 patients were treated 
with 750 mg once daily fasted. The median age was 54.0 years (range: 28 to 84 years); 77.1% of 
patients were younger than 65 years. A total of 55.8% of patients were female. 64.5% of the study 
population were Caucasian, 29.4% Asian, 0.4% Black and 2.6% other races. The majority of patients 
had adenocarcinoma (97.0%) and had either never smoked or were former smokers (96.1%). The 
ECOG performance status was 0/1/2 in 46.3%/47.6%/6.1% of patients respectively, and 58.0% had 
brain metastasis at baseline. All patients were treated with prior crizotinib. All except one patient 
received prior chemotherapy (including a platinum doublet) for advanced disease; 11.3% of the 
patients in the ceritinib arm and 12.1% of the patients in the chemotherapy arm were treated with two 
prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease. 
Patients were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond initial progression in case of 
continued clinical benefit as per the investigator's opinion. Patients randomised to the chemotherapy 
arm could further crossover to receive ceritinib upon RECIST-defined disease progression confirmed 
by BIRC. 
The median duration of follow-up was 16.5 months (from randomisation to data cut-off date). 
The study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS by 
BIRC with an estimated 51% risk reduction in the ceritinib arm compared to chemotherapy arm (see 
Table 4 and Figure 3). The PFS benefit of ceritinib was consistent across various subgroups including 
age, gender, race, smoking class, ECOG performance status, and presence of brain metastases or prior 
response to crizotinib. The PFS benefit was further supported by local investigator assessment, and 
analysis of overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). 
OS data was immature with 48 (41.7%) events in the ceritinib arm and 50 (43.1%) events in the 
chemotherapy arm, corresponding to approximately 50% of the required events for the final OS 
analysis. In addition, 81 patients (69.8%) in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent ceritinib as 
first antineoplastic therapy after study treatment discontinuation. 
Efficacy data from Study A2303 are summarised in Table 4, and the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and 
OS are shown in Figure 3 and 4, respectively.

Patient reported outcome questionnaires were collected using the EORTC QLQ C30/LC13, LCSS and 
EQ-5D-5L. 75% or more of patients in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms completed the LCSS 
questionnaires at most of the time points during the course of the study. Significant improvements 
were reported for the majority of lung cancer specific symptoms for ceritinib compared to 
chemotherapy (four out of six LCSS and 10 out of 12 QLQ-LC13 symptom scores). Ceritinib 
significantly prolonged time to deterioration for the lung cancer specific symptoms of interest of 
cough, pain and dyspnoea (composite endpoint LCSS: HR=0.40; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.65, median Time to 
Deterioration [TTD] 18.0 months [95% CI: 13.4, NE] in the ceritinib arm versus 4.4 months [95% CI: 
1.6, 8.6] in the chemotherapy arm; LC13: HR=0.34; 95% CI: 0.22, 0. 52, median TTD 11.1 months 
[95% CI: 7.1, 14.2] in the ceritinib arm versus 2.1 months [95% CI: 1.0, 5.6] in the chemotherapy 
arm). The EQ-5D questionnaire showed a significant overall health status improvement for ceritinib in 
comparison to the chemotherapy. 
In Study A2303, 133 patients with baseline brain metastasis (66 patients in the ceritinib arm and 
67 patients in the chemotherapy arm) were assessed for intracranial response by BIRC neuro-
radiologist (per modified RECIST 1.1 (i.e. up to 5 lesions in the brain). The OIRR in patients with 
measurable disease in the brain at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment was higher in the 
ceritinib arm (35.3%, 95% CI: 14.2, 61.7) compared to the chemotherapy arm (5.0%, 95% CI: 0.1, 
24.9). The median PFS by BIRC using RECIST 1.1 was longer in the ceritinib arm compared to the 
chemotherapy arm in both subgroups of patients with brain metastases and without brain metastases. 
The median PFS in patients with brain metastases was 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.4, 6.2) versus 
1.5 months (95% CI: 1.3, 1.8) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively with HR=0.54 
(95% CI: 0.36, 0.80). The median PFS in patients without brain metastases was 8.3 months (95% CI: 
4.1, 14.0) versus 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.4, 4.1) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively 
with HR=0.41 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.69).

Dose optimisation Study A2112 (ASCEND-8) 
The efficacy of ceritinib 450 mg with food was evaluated in a multicentre, open-label dose 
optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8). A total of 147 previously untreated patients with 
ALK-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC were randomised to receive ceritinib 450 mg 
once daily with food (N=73) or ceritinib 750 mg once daily under fasted conditions (N=74). A key 
secondary efficacy endpoint was ORR according to RECIST 1.1 as evaluated by BIRC. 
The population characteristics of the previously untreated patients with ALK-positive locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC across the two arms, 450 mg with food (N=73) and 750 mg fasted 
(N=74), were: mean age 54.3 and 51.3 years, age less than 65 (78.1% and 83.8%), female (56.2% and 
47.3%), Caucasian (49.3% and 54.1%), Asian (39.7% and 35.1%), never or former smoker (90.4% 
and 95.9%), WHO PS 0 or 1 (91.7% and 91.9%), adenocarcinoma histology (98.6% and 93.2%), and 
metastases to the brain (32.9% and 28.4%), respectively. 
Efficacy results from ASCEND-8 are summarised in Table 5 below.

Single arm studies X2101 and A2201 
The use of ceritinib in the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC patients previously treated with an ALK 
inhibitor was investigated in two global, multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase 1/2 studies 
(Study X2101 and Study A2201). 
In study X2101 a total of 246 ALK-positive NSCLC patients were treated at a ceritinib dose of 
750 mg once daily fasted: 163 who had received prior treatment with an ALK inhibitor and 83 who 
were ALK inhibitor naïve. Of the 163 ALK-positive NSCLC patients who had received prior 
treatment with an ALK inhibitor, the median age was 52 years (range: 24-80 years); 86.5% were 
younger than 65 years and 54% were female. The majority of patients were Caucasian (66.3%) or 
Asian (28.8%). 93.3% had adenocarcinoma and 96.9% had either never been or were former smokers. 
All of the patients were treated with at least one regimen prior to enrolment into the study and 84.0% 
with two or more regimens. 
Study A2201 involved 140 patients who had been previously treated with 1-3 lines of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy followed by treatment with crizotinib, and who had then progressed on crizotinib. The 
median age was 51 years (range: 29-80 years); 87.1% of patients were younger than 65 years and 
50.0% were female. The majority of patients were Caucasian (60.0%) or Asian (37.9%). 92.1% of 
patients had adenocarcinoma.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Peak plasma levels (Cmax) of ceritinib are achieved approximately 4 to 6 hours after a single oral 
administration in patients. Oral absorption was estimated to be ≥25% based on metabolite percentages 
in the faeces. The absolute bioavailability of ceritinib has not been determined. 
Systemic exposure of ceritinib was increased when administered with food. Ceritinib AUCinf values 
were approximately 58% and 73% higher (Cmax approximately 43% and 41% higher) in healthy 
subjects when a single 500 mg ceritinib dose was administered with a low fat meal (containing 
approximately 330 kcalories and 9 grams of fat) and a high fat meal (containing approximately 
1000 kcalories and 58 grams of fat), respectively, as compared with the fasted state. 
In a dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in patients comparing ceritinib 450 mg or 600 mg 
daily with food (approximately 100 to 500 kcalories and 1.5 to 15 grams of fat) to 750 mg daily under 
fasted conditions (dose and food condition of administration initially authorised), there was no 
clinically meaningful difference in the systemic steady-state exposure of ceritinib for the 450 mg with 
food arm (N=36) compared to the 750 mg fasted arm (N=31), with only small increases in steady-state 
AUC (90% CI) by 4% (-13%, 24%) and Cmax (90% CI) by 3% (-14%, 22%). In contrast, the 
steady-state AUC (90% CI) and Cmax (90% CI) for the 600 mg with food arm (N=30) increased by 
24% (3%, 49%) and 25% (4%, 49%), respectively, compared to the 750 mg fasted arm. The maximum 
recommended dose of ceritinib is 450 mg taken orally once daily with food (see section 4.2). 
After single oral administration of ceritinib in patients, plasma exposure to ceritinib, as represented by 
Cmax and AUClast, increased dose-proportionally over the 50 to 750 mg dose range under fasted 
conditions. In contrast with single-dose data, pre-dose concentration (Cmin) after repeated daily dosing 
appeared to increase in a greater than dose-proportional manner. 
Distribution 
Binding of ceritinib to human plasma proteins in vitro is approximately 97% in a concentration 
independent manner, from 50 ng/ml to 10,000 ng/ml. Ceritinib also has a slight preferential 
distribution to red blood cells, relative to plasma, with a mean in vitro blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.35. 
In vitro studies suggest that ceritinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not of breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) or multi-resistance protein 2 (MRP2). The in vitro apparent passive 
permeability of ceritinib was determined to be low. 
In rats, ceritinib crosses the intact blood brain barrier with a brain-to-blood exposure (AUCinf) ratio of 
about 15%. There are no data related to brain-to-blood exposure ratio in humans. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A was the major enzyme involved in the metabolic clearance 
of ceritinib. 
Following a single oral administration of radioactive ceritinib dose at 750 mg fasted, ceritinib was the 
main circulating component in human plasma. A total of 11 metabolites were found circulating in 
plasma at low levels with mean contribution to the radioactivity AUC of ≤2.3% for each metabolite. 
Main biotransformation pathways identified in healthy subjects included mono-oxygenation, 
O-dealkylation, and N-formylation. Secondary biotransformation pathways involving the primary 
biotransformation products included glucuronidation and dehydrogenation. Addition of a thiol group 
to O-dealkylated ceritinib was also observed. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Following single oral doses of ceritinib under fasted conditions, the geometric mean apparent plasma 
terminal half-life (T½) of ceritinib ranged from 31 to 41 hours in patients over the 400 to 750 mg dose 
range. Daily oral dosing of ceritinib results in achievement of steady-state by approximately 15 days 
and remains stable afterwards, with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 6.2 after 3 weeks of daily 
dosing. The geometric mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ceritinib was lower at steady-state 
(33.2 litres/hour) after 750 mg daily oral dosing than after a single 750 mg oral dose (88.5 litres/hour), 
suggesting that ceritinib demonstrates non-linear pharmacokinetics over time. 
The primary route of excretion of ceritinib and its metabolites is in the faeces. Recovery of unchanged 
ceritinib in the faeces accounts for a mean 68% of an oral dose. Only 1.3% of the administered oral 
dose is recovered in the urine. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ceritinib (750 mg under 
fasted conditions) was evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A; N=8), moderate (Child-
Pugh class B; N=7), or severe (Child-Pugh class C; N=7) hepatic impairment and in 8 healthy subjects 
with normal hepatic function. The geometric mean AUCinf (unbound AUCinf) of ceritinib was 
increased by 18% (35%) and 2% (22%) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, 
respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. 
The geometric mean AUCinf (unbound AUCinf) of ceritinib was increased by 66% (108%) in subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (see section 4.2). A 
dedicated pharmacokinetic study under steady-state in patients with hepatic impairment has not been 
conducted. 
Renal impairment 
A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted. Based 
on available data, ceritinib elimination via the kidney is negligible (1.3% of a single oral administered 
dose). 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 345 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 
to <90 ml/min), 82 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <60 ml/min) and 546 patients 
with normal renal function (≥90 ml/min), ceritinib exposures were similar in patients with mild and 
moderate renal impairment and normal renal function, suggesting that no dose adjustment is necessary 
in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 
<30 ml/min) were not included in the clinical studies of ceritinib (see section 4.2). 
Effects of age, gender, and race 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that age, gender and race had no clinically meaningful 
influence on ceritinib exposure. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The potential for QT interval prolongation of ceritinib was assessed in seven clinical studies with 
ceritinib. Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-state to evaluate the effect 
of ceritinib on the QT interval in 925 patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg once daily fasted. A 
categorical outlier analysis of ECG data demonstrated new QTc >500 msec in 12 patients (1.3%). 
There were 58 patients (6.3%) with a QTc increase from baseline >60 msec. A central tendency 
analysis of the QTc data at average steady-state concentration from Study A2301 demonstrated that 
the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for QTc increase from baseline was 15.3 msec at ceritinib 
750 mg fasted. A pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that ceritinib causes concentration-dependent 
increases in QTc (see section 4.4). 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Safety pharmacology studies indicate that ceritinib is unlikely to interfere with vital functions of the 
respiratory and central nervous systems. In vitro data show that the IC50 for the inhibitory effect of 
ceritinib on the hERG potassium channel was 0.4 micromolar. An in vivo telemetry study in monkeys 
showed a modest QT prolongation in 1 of 4 animals after receiving the highest dose of ceritinib. ECG 
studies in monkeys after 4- or 13-weeks of dosing with ceritinib have not shown QT prolongation or 
abnormal ECGs. 
The micronucleus test in TK6 cells was positive. No signs of mutagenicity or clastogenicity were 
observed in other in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with ceritinib. Therefore, genotoxic risk is 
not expected in humans. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with ceritinib. 
Reproductive toxicology studies (i.e. embryo-foetal development studies) in pregnant rats and rabbits 
indicated no foetotoxicity or teratogenicity after dosing with ceritinib during organogenesis; however, 
maternal plasma exposure was less than that observed at the recommended human dose. Formal 
non-clinical studies on the potential effects of ceritinib on fertility have not been conducted. 
The principal toxicity related to ceritinib administration in rats and monkeys was inflammation of the 
extra-hepatic bile ducts accompanied by increased neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood. Mixed 
cell/neutrophilic inflammation of the extra-hepatic ducts extended to the pancreas and/or duodenum at 
higher doses. Gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in both species characterised by body weight loss, 
decreased food consumption, emesis (monkey), diarrhoea and, at high doses, by histopathological 
lesions including erosion, mucosal inflammation and foamy macrophages in the duodenal crypts and 
submucosa. The liver was also affected in both species, at exposures that approximate clinical 
exposures at the recommended human dose, and included minimal increases in liver transaminases in 
a few animals and vacuolation of the intra-hepatic bile duct epithelium. Alveolar foamy macrophages 
(confirmed phospholipidosis) were seen in the lungs of rats, but not in monkeys, and the lymph nodes 
of rats and monkeys had macrophage aggregates. Target organ effects showed partial to complete 
recovery. 
Effects on the thyroid were observed in both rat (mild increases in thyroid stimulating hormone and 
triiodothyronine/thyroxine T3/T4 concentrations with no microscopic correlate) and monkey 
(depletion of colloid in males in 4-week study, and one monkey at high dose with diffuse follicular 
cell hyperplasia and increased thyroid stimulating hormone in 13-week study). As these non-clinical 
effects were mild, variable and inconsistent, the relationship between ceritinib and thyroid gland 
changes in animals is unclear.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Zykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Zykadia as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with 
crizotinib. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with ceritinib should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anti-cancer medicinal products. 
ALK testing 
An accurate and validated ALK assay is necessary for the selection of ALK-positive NSCLC patients 
(see section 5.1). 
ALK-positive NSCLC status should be established prior to initiation of ceritinib therapy. Assessment 
for ALK-positive NSCLC should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the 
specific technology being utilised.

Posology 
The recommended dose of ceritinib is 450 mg taken orally once daily with food at the same time each 
day. 
The maximum recommended dose with food is 450 mg taken orally once daily. Treatment should 
continue as long as clinical benefit is observed. 
If a dose is missed, the patient should make up that dose, unless the next dose is due within 12 hours. 
If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, the patient should not take an additional dose, but 
should continue with the next scheduled dose. 
Ceritinib should be discontinued in patients unable to tolerate 150 mg daily taken with food. 
Dose adjustment due to adverse reactions 
Temporary dose interruption and/or dose reduction of ceritinib may be required based on individual 
safety and tolerability. If dose reduction is required due to an adverse drug reaction (ADR) not listed 
in Table 1, then this should be achieved by decrements of 150 mg daily. Early identification and 
management of ADRs with standard supportive care measures should be considered. 
In patients treated with ceritinib 450 mg with food, 24.1% of patients had an adverse event that 
required at least one dose reduction and 55.6% of patients had an adverse event that required at least 
one dose interruption. The median time to first dose reduction due to any reason was 9.7 weeks. 
Table 1 summarises recommendations for dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation of ceritinib 
in the management of selected ADRs.

Lipase or amylase elevation grade ≥3 
Withhold ceritinib until recovery to asymptomatic 
(grade ≤1) bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 beats 
per minute (bpm) or above. 
Evaluate concomitant medicinal products known to 
cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive 
medicinal products. 
If a contributing concomitant medicinal product is 
identified and discontinued, or its dose is adjusted, 
reinitiate ceritinib at the previous dose upon 
recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart 
rate of 60 bpm or above. 
If no contributing concomitant medicinal product is 
identified, or if contributing concomitant medicinal 
products are not discontinued or dose modified, 
reinitiate ceritinib with dose reduced by 150 mg 
upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a 
heart rate of 60 bpm or above. 
Permanently discontinue ceritinib if no contributing 
concomitant medicinal product is identified. 
If a contributing concomitant medicinal product is

Heart rate less than 60 beats per minutes (bpm) 
Permanently discontinue in the event of recurrence 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided (see section 4.5). If concomitant use 
of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, the dose of ceritinib should be reduced by approximately 
one third (dose not clinically verified), rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dose strength. 
Patients should be carefully monitored for safety. 
If long-term concomitant treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is necessary and the patient 
tolerates the reduced dose well, the dose may be increased again with careful monitoring for safety, to 
avoid potential under-treatment. 
After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume at the dose that was taken prior to initiating 
the strong CYP3A inhibitor.

CYP3A substrates 
When ceritinib is co-administered with other medicinal products, the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) for the other product must be consulted for the recommendations regarding 
co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Co-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP3A or CYP3A substrates 
known to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, ciclosporin, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lovastatin, simvastatin, 
sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus) should be avoided and 
alternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible. 
If unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with 
narrow therapeutic indices should be considered. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted. 
However, based on available data, ceritinib elimination via the kidney is negligible. Therefore, no dose 
adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution should be used in 
patients with severe renal impairment, as there is no experience with ceritinib in this population (see 
section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on available data, ceritinib is eliminated primarily via the liver. Particular caution should be 
exercised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment and the dose should be reduced by 
approximately one third, rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dose strength (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
Elderly (≥65 years) 
The limited data on the safety and efficacy of ceritinib in patients aged 65 years and older do not 
suggest that a dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). There are no available 
data on patients over 85 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ceritinib in children and adolescents aged up to 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Ceritinib is for oral use. The tablets should be administered orally once daily with food at the same 
time every day. It is important that ceritinib is taken with food to reach the appropriate exposure. Food 
can range from a light to a full meal (see section 5.2). The tablets should be swallowed whole with 
water and should not be chewed or crushed. 
For patients who develop a concurrent medical condition and are unable to take ceritinib with food 
please refer to section 4.5. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatotoxicity 
Cases of hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving ceritinib in clinical studies. Increases to 
grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients. The majority of cases were 
manageable with dose interruption and/or dose reduction. Few events required discontinuation of 
treatment. 
Patients should be monitored with liver laboratory tests (including ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior 
to the start of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first three months of treatment and monthly 
thereafter. In patients who develop transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver 
transaminases and total bilirubin should be carried out as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8). Particular caution should be exercised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, and 
the dose should be adjusted (see section 4.2). Limited experience in these patients showed a worsening 
of the underlying condition (hepatic encephalopathy) in 2 out of 10 patients exposed to 750 mg single 
doses of ceritinib under fasted conditions (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). Other factors apart from study 
treatment could have impacted on observed events of hepatic encephalopathy, however, the relation 
between study treatment and events cannot be fully ruled out. No dose adjustment is necessary in 
patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). 
Interstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis 
Severe, life-threatening or fatal ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in patients treated with ceritinib 
in clinical studies. Most of these severe/life-threatening cases improved or resolved with interruption 
of treatment. 
Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Other potential 
causes of ILD/pneumonitis should be excluded, and ceritinib should be permanently discontinued in 
patients diagnosed with any grade treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
QT interval prolongation 
QTc prolongation has been observed in clinical studies in patients treated with ceritinib (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.2), which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. 
torsade de pointes) or sudden death. 
Use of ceritinib in patients with congenital long QT syndrome should be avoided. The benefits and 
potential risks of ceritinib should be considered before beginning therapy in patients who have 
pre-existing bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 beats per minute [bpm]), patients who have a history 
of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, patients who are taking anti-arrhythmics or other medicinal 
products that are known to prolong the QT interval and patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac 
disease and/or electrolyte disturbances. Periodic monitoring with ECGs and periodic monitoring of 
electrolytes (e.g. potassium) is recommended in these patients. In the event of vomiting, diarrhoea, 
dehydration or impaired renal function, correct electrolytes as clinically indicated. Ceritinib should be 
permanently discontinued in patients who develop QTc >500 msec or >60 msec change from baseline 
and torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious 
arrhythmia. Ceritinib should be withheld in patients who develop QTc >500 msec on at least two 
separate ECGs until recovery to baseline or a QTc ≤480 msec, then reinitiated with dose reduced by 
150 mg (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bradycardia 
Asymptomatic cases of bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) have been observed in 21 out of 
925 (2.3%) patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies. 
Use of ceritinib in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia (e.g. beta blockers, 
non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine and digoxin) should be avoided as far as 
possible. Heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored regularly. In cases of symptomatic 
bradycardia that is not life-threatening, ceritinib should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic 
bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, the use of concomitant medicinal products should be 
evaluated and the ceritinib dose adjusted if necessary. In the event of life-threatening bradycardia 
ceritinib should be permanently discontinued if no contributing concomitant medicinal product is 
identified; however, if associated with a concomitant medicinal product known to cause bradycardia or 
hypotension, ceritinib should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate 
of 60 bpm or above. If the concomitant medicinal product can be adjusted or discontinued, ceritinib 
should be reinitiated with dose reduced by 150 mg on recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a 
heart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent monitoring (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting occurred in 76.9% of 108 patients treated with ceritinib at the 
recommended dose of 450 mg taken with food in a dose optimisation study and were mainly grade 1 
(52.8%) and grade 2 (22.2%) events. Two patients (1.9%) experienced one grade 3 event each 
(diarrhoea and vomiting respectively). Nine patients (8.3%) required study drug interruption due to 
diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting. One patient (0.9%) required dose adjustment due to vomiting. In the 
same study, the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions were higher for 
patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg fasted (diarrhoea 80.0%, nausea 60.0%, vomiting 65.5%; 17.3% 
reported a grade 3 event) compared to 450 mg with food (diarrhoea 59.3%, nausea 42.6%, vomiting 
38.0%; 1.9% reported a grade 3). 
In the 450 mg with food and 750 mg fasted arms of this dose optimisation study, no patients required 
discontinuation of ceritinib due to diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored and managed using standards of care, including anti-diarrhoeals, 
anti-emetics or fluid replacement, as clinically indicated. Dose interruption and dose reduction should 
be employed as necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, 
the patient should not take an additional dose, but should continue with the next scheduled dose. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Cases of hyperglycaemia (all grades) have been reported in less than 10% of patients treated with 
ceritinib in clinical studies; grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia was reported in 5.4% of patients. The risk of 
hyperglycaemia was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or concurrent steroid use. 
Patients should be monitored for fasting plasma glucose prior to the start of ceritinib treatment and 
periodically thereafter as clinically indicated. Anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products should be 
initiated or optimised as indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Lipase and/or amylase elevations 
Elevations of lipase and/or amylase have occurred in patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies. 
Patients should be monitored for lipase and amylase elevations prior to the start of ceritinib treatment 
and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Cases of pancreatitis have 
been reported in patients treated with ceritinib (see section 4.8).

Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Agents that may increase ceritinib plasma concentrations 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 450 mg fasted ceritinib dose with ketoconazole 
(200 mg twice daily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor, resulted in 2.9-fold and 1.2-fold 
increase in ceritinib AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone. The 
steady-state AUC of ceritinib at reduced doses after co-administration with ketoconazole 200 mg 
twice daily for 14 days was predicted by simulations to be similar to the steady-state AUC of ceritinib 
alone. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided during treatment with ceritinib. 
If it is not possible to avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited 
to, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and 
nefazodone), the dose of ceritinib should be reduced by approximately one third, rounded to the 
nearest multiple of the 150 mg dose strength. After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, 
ceritinib should be resumed at the dose that was taken prior to initiating the strong CYP3A inhibitor. 
P-gp inhibitors 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). If 
ceritinib is administered with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp, an increase in ceritinib 
concentration is likely. Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors and 
ADRs carefully monitored. 
Agents that may decrease ceritinib plasma concentrations 
Strong CYP3A and P-gp inducers 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 750 mg fasted ceritinib dose with rifampicin (600 mg 
daily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inducer, resulted in 70% and 44% decreases in ceritinib 
AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone. Co-administration of 
ceritinib with strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers decreases ceritinib plasma concentrations. Concomitant 
use of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided; this includes, but is not limited to, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). Caution 
should be exercised with concomitant use of P-gp inducers. 
Agents that affect gastric pH 
Ceritinib demonstrates pH-dependent solubility and becomes poorly soluble as pH increases in vitro. 
Acid reducing agents (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids) can alter the 
solubility of ceritinib and reduce its bioavailability. Co-administration of a single 750 mg fasted 
ceritinib dose with a proton pump inhibitor (esomeprazole) 40 mg daily for 6 days in healthy, fasting 
subjects decreased ceritinib AUC by 76% and Cmax by 79%. The drug-drug interaction study was 
designed to observe the impact of proton pump inhibitor in the worst scenario, but in clinical use the 
impact of proton pump inhibitor on ceritinib exposure appears to be less pronounced. A dedicated 
study to evaluate the effect of gastric acid-reducing agents on the bioavailability of ceritinib under 
steady state has not been conducted. Caution is advised with concomitant use of proton pump 
inhibitors, as exposure of ceritinib may be reduced. There is no data with concomitant use of H2 
blockers or antacids. However, the risk for a clinically relevant decrease in bioavailability of ceritinib 
is possibly lower with concomitant use of H2 blockers if they are administered 10 hours before or 
2 hours after the ceritinib dose, and with antacids if they are administered 2 hours before or 2 hours 
after the ceritinib dose. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Agents whose plasma concentration may be altered by ceritinib 
CYP3A and CYP2C9 substrates 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib competitively inhibits the metabolism of a CYP3A substrate, 
midazolam, and a CYP2C9 substrate, diclofenac. Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A was also 
observed. 
Ceritinib has been classified in vivo as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and has the potential to interact with 
medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, which may lead to increased serum 
concentrations of the other product. Co-administration of a single dose of midazolam (a sensitive 
CYP3A substrate) following 3 weeks of ceritinib dosing in patients (750 mg daily fasted) increased 
the midazolam AUCinf (90% CI) by 5.4-fold (4.6, 6.3) compared to midazolam alone. 
Co-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP3A or CYP3A substrates 
known to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, ciclosporin, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lovastatin, simvastatin, 
sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus) should be avoided and 
alternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition should be used if possible. 
If unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with 
narrow therapeutic indices should be considered. 
Ceritinib has been classified in vivo as a weak CYP2C9 inhibitor. Co-administration of a single dose 
of warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) following 3 weeks of ceritinib dosing in patients (750 mg daily 
fasted) increased the S-warfarin AUCinf (90% CI) by 54% (36%, 75%) compared to warfarin alone. 
Co-administration of ceritinib with substrates primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 or CYP2C9 
substrates known to have narrow therapeutic indices (e.g. phenytoin and warfarin) should be avoided. 
If unavoidable, dose reduction for co-administered medicinal products that are CYP2C9 substrates 
with narrow therapeutic indices should be considered. Increasing the frequency of international 
normalised ratio (INR) monitoring may be considered if co-administration with warfarin is 
unavoidable. 
CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 substrates 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib also inhibits CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Therefore, ceritinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of 
co-administered medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by these enzymes. Caution 
should be exercised with concomitant use of CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 substrates and ADRs carefully 
monitored. 
A risk for induction of other PXR regulated enzymes apart from CYP3A4 cannot be completely 
excluded. The effectiveness of concomitant administration of oral contraceptives may be reduced. 
Agents that are substrates of transporters 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib does not inhibit apical efflux transporter MRP2, hepatic uptake 
transporters OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, renal organic anion uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3, or the 
organic cation uptake transporters OCT1 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, 
clinical drug-drug interactions as a result of ceritinib-mediated inhibition of substrates for these 
transporters are unlikely to occur. Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-gp 
and BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, ceritinib may have the potential to increase 
plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products transported by these proteins. Caution 
should be exercised with concomitant use of BCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin, topotecan, 
sulfasalazine) and P-gp substrates (digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine, pravastatin) and ADRs carefully 
monitored. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
In clinical studies, QT prolongation was observed with ceritinib. Therefore, ceritinib should be used 
with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT interval, including those 
patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products such as class I (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, 
disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) anti-arrhythmics or other 
medicinal products that may lead to QT prolongation such as domperidone, droperidol, chloroquine, 
halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, cisapride and moxifloxacin. Monitoring of the 
QT interval is indicated in the event of combinations of such medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
Food/drink interactions 
Ceritinib should be taken with food. The bioavailability of ceritinib is increased in the presence of 
food. 
For patients who develop a concurrent medical condition and are unable to take ceritinib with food, 
ceritinib can be taken on an empty stomach as the alternate continued treatment regimen, in which no 
food should be eaten for at least two hours before and one hour after the dose. Patients should not 
alternate between fasted and fed dosing. Dose must be adjusted properly, i.e for patients treated with 
450 mg or 300 mg with food, the dose should be increased to 750 mg or 450 mg taken on an empty 
stomach, respectively (see section 5.2) and for patients treated with 150 mg with food treatment 
should be discontinued. For subsequent dose adjustment and management recommendations for 
ADRs, please follow table 1 (see section 4.2). The maximum allowable dose under fasted condition is 
750 mg (see section 5.2). 
Patients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they may inhibit CYP3A in the 
gut wall and may increase the bioavailability of ceritinib. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use a highly effective method of contraception 
while taking ceritinib and for up to 3 months after discontinuing treatment (see section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of ceritinib in pregnant women. 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Ceritinib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with ceritinib. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ceritinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infant 
cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
ceritinib therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman (see section 5.3). 
Fertility 
The potential for ceritinib to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Zykadia has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Caution should be exercised 
when driving or using machines during treatment as patients may experience fatigue or vision 
disorders. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) described below reflect exposure to ceritinib 750 mg once daily fasted 
in 925 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC across a pool of seven clinical studies including 
two randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 studies (studies A2301 and A2303). 
The median duration of exposure to ceritinib 750 mg fasted was 44.9 weeks (range: 0.1 to 
200.1 weeks). 
ADRs with an incidence of ≥10% in patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg fasted were diarrhoea, 
nausea, vomiting, fatigue, liver laboratory test abnormalities, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, 
weight decreased, constipation, blood creatinine increased, rash, anaemia and oesophageal disorder. 
Grade 3-4 ADRs with an incidence of ≥5% in patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg fasted were liver 
laboratory test abnormalities, fatigue, vomiting, hyperglycaemia, nausea and diarrhoea. 
In the dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in both previously treated and untreated patients 
with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, the overall safety profile of ceritinib at the recommended dose 
of 450 mg with food (N=108) was consistent with ceritinib 750 mg fasted (N=110), except for a 
reduction in gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions, while achieving comparable steady-state exposure 
(see section 5.1 and subsection ‘Gastrointestinal adverse reactions’ below). 
Tabulated list of ADRs 
Table 2 shows the frequency category of ADRs reported for ceritinib in patients treated at a dose of 
750 mg fasted (N=925) in seven clinical studies. The frequency of selected gastrointestinal ADRs 
(diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) are based on patients treated with a dose of 450 mg once-daily with 
food (N=108). 
ADRs are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the ADRs 
are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding 
frequency category using the following convention (CIOMS III) is also provided for each ADR: very 
common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within 
each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Elderly (≥65 years) 
Across seven clinical studies, 168 out of 925 patients (18.2%) treated with ceritinib were aged 
65 years or older. The safety profile in patients aged 65 years or older was similar to that in patients 
less than 65 years of age (see section 4.2). There are no safety data in patients older than 85 years of 
age. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Concurrent elevations of ALT or AST greater than 3× ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN 
without elevated alkaline phosphatase have been observed in less than 1% of patients in clinical 
studies with ceritinib. Increases to grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients 
receiving ceritinib. Hepatotoxicity events were managed with dose interruptions or reductions in 
40.6% of patients. 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of treatment in clinical studies 
with ceritinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Liver laboratory tests including ALT, AST and total bilirubin should be performed prior to the start of 
treatment, every 2 weeks during the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter, with more 
frequent testing for grade 2, 3 or 4 elevations. Patients should be monitored for liver laboratory test 
abnormalities and managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were among the most commonly reported gastrointestinal events. In 
the dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in both previously treated and untreated patients 
with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC at the recommended dose of ceritinib 450 mg taken with food 
(N=108), adverse events of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were mainly grade 1 (52.8%) and grade 2 
(22.2%). Grade 3 events of diarrhoea and vomiting were each reported in two different patients 
(1.9%). Gastrointestinal events were managed primarily with concomitant medicinal products 
including anti-emetic/anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products. Nine patients (8.3%) required study drug 
interruption due to diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting. One patient (0.9%) required dose adjustment. In the 
450 mg with food and 750 mg fasted arms, no patients had diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting that 
required discontinuation of study drug. In the same study the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal 
adverse drug reactions were reduced for patients treated with ceritinib 450 mg with food (diarrhoea 
59.3%, nausea 42.6%, vomiting 38.0%; 1.9% reported a grade 3 event) compared to 750 mg fasted 
(diarrhoea 80.0%, nausea 60.0%, vomiting 65.5%; 17.3% reported a grade 3 event). Patients should be 
managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
QT interval prolongation 
QTc prolongation has been observed in patients treated with ceritinib. Across the seven clinical 
studies, 9.7% of patients treated with ceritinib had events of QT prolongation (any grade), including 
grade 3 or 4 events in 2.1% of patients. These events required dose reduction or interruption in 2.1% 
of patients and led to discontinuation in 0.2% of patients. 
Treatment with ceritinib is not recommended in patients who have congenital long QT syndrome or 
who are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Particular care should be exercised when administering ceritinib to patients with an increased risk of 
experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging medicinal product. 
Patients should be monitored for QT prolongation and managed as recommended in sections 4.2 and 
4.4. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bradycardia 
Across the seven clinical studies, bradycardia and/or sinus bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) 
events (all grade 1) were reported in 2.3% of patients. These events required dose reduction or 
interruption in 0.2% of patients. None of these events led to discontinuation of ceritinib treatment. The 
use of concomitant medicinal products associated with bradycardia should be carefully evaluated. 
Patients who develop symptomatic bradycardia should be managed as recommended in sections 4.2 
and 4.4. 
Interstitial lung disease/Pneumonitis 
Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have been observed in 
patients treated with ceritinib. Across the seven clinical studies, any grade ILD/pneumonitis has been 
reported in 2.1% of patients treated with ceritinib, and grade 3 or 4 events have been reported in 1.2% 
of patients. These events required dose reduction or interruption in 1.1% of patients and led to 
discontinuation in 0.9% of patients. Patients with pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis 
should be monitored. Other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis should be excluded (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4). 
Hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia (all grades) was reported in 9.4% of patients treated with ceritinib across the seven 
clinical studies; grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 5.4% of patients. These events required dose 
reduction or interruption in 1.4% of patients and led to discontinuation in 0.1% of patients. The risk of 
hyperglycaemia was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or concurrent steroid use. 
Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is required prior to the start of ceritinib treatment and periodically 
thereafter as clinically indicated. Administration of anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products should be 
initiated or optimised as indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no reported experience with overdose in humans. General supportive measures should be 
initiated in all cases of overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, 
ATC code: L01ED02. 
Mechanism of action 
Ceritinib is an orally highly selective and potent ALK inhibitor. Ceritinib inhibits autophosphorylation 
of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signalling proteins and proliferation of 
ALK-dependent cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ALK translocation determines expression of the resulting fusion protein and consequent aberrant ALK 
signaling in NSCLC. In the majority of NSCLC cases, EML4 is the translocation partner for ALK; this 
generates an EML4-ALK fusion protein containing the protein kinase domain of ALK fused to the 
N-terminal part of EML4. Ceritinib was demonstrated to be effective against EML4-ALK activity in a 
NSCLC cell line (H2228), resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and regression of 
tumours in H2228-derived xenografts in mouse and rat. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Previously untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC - randomised phase 3 Study A2301 (ASCEND-4) 
The efficacy and safety of ceritinib for the treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC patients who 
have not received previous systemic treatment anti-cancer therapy (including ALK inhibitor) with the 
exception of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy, was demonstrated in a global multicentre, randomised, 
open-label phase 3 Study A2301. 
A total of 376 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by WHO performance status, prior 
adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and presence/absence of brain metastasis at screening) to receive 
either ceritinib (750 mg daily, fasted) or chemotherapy (based on investigator’s choice - pemetrexed 
[500 mg/m2] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m2] or carboplatin [AUC 5-6], administered every 21 days). 
Patients who completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy (induction) without progressive disease 
subsequently received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) as single-agent maintenance therapy every 21 days. 
One hundred and eighty-nine (189) patients were randomised to ceritinib and one hundred eighty-
seven (187) were randomised to chemotherapy. 
The median age was 54 years (range: 22 to 81 years); 78.5% of patients were younger than 65 years. A 
total of 57.4% of patients were female. 53.7% of the study population was Caucasian, 42.0% Asian, 
1.6% Black and 2.6% other races The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (96.5%) and had either 
never smoked or were former smokers (92.0%). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status was 0/1/2 in 37.0%/56.4%/6.4% of patients, and 32.2% had brain metastasis at 
baseline. 59.5% of patients with brain metastasis at baseline received no prior radiotherapy to the 
brain. Patients with symptomatic CNS (central nervous system) metastases who were neurologically 
unstable or had required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to screening to manage 
CNS symptoms, were excluded from the study. 
Patients were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond initial progression in case of 
continued clinical benefit as per the investigator's opinion. Patients randomised to the chemotherapy 
arm could cross-over to receive ceritinib upon RECIST-defined disease progression confirmed by 
blinded independent review committee (BIRC). One hundred and five (105) patients out of the 
145 patients (72.4%) that discontinued treatment in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent ALK 
inhibitor as first antineoplastic therapy. Of these patients 81 received ceritinib. 
The median duration of follow-up was 19.7 months (from randomisation to cut-off date). 
The study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in 
progression free survival (PFS) by BIRC (see Table 3 and Figure 1). The PFS benefit of ceritinib was 
consistent by investigator assessment and across various subgroups including age, gender, race, 
smoking class, ECOG performance status and disease burden. 
The overall survival (OS) data was not mature with 107 deaths representing approximately 42.3% of 
the required events for the final OS analysis. 
Efficacy data from Study A2301 are summarised in Table 3, and the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and 
OS are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.

Patient reported outcome questionnaires (Lung cancer symptom scale [LCSS], EORTC-QLQ-C30 
[C30], EORTC QLQ-LC13 [LC13] and EQ-5D-5L) were completed by 80% or more of patients in the 
ceritinib and chemotherapy arms for all questionnaires at most of the time-points during the course of 
the study. 
Ceritinib significantly prolonged time to deterioration for the pre-specified lung cancer specific 
symptoms of interest of cough, pain and dyspnoea (composite endpoint LCSS: HR=0.61, 95% CI: 
0.41, 0.90, median Time to Deterioration [TTD] NE [95% CI: 20.9, NE] in the ceritinib arm versus 
18.4 months [13.9, NE] in the chemotherapy arm; LC13: HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.69, median TTD 
23.6 months [95% CI: 20.7, NE] in the ceritinib arm versus 12.6 months [95% CI: 8.9, 14.9] in the 
chemotherapy arm). 
Patients receiving ceritinib showed significant improvements over chemotherapy in general Quality of 
Life and global Health Status measures (LCSS [p<0.001], QLQ-C30, [p<0.001] and EQ-5D-5L index 
[p<0.001]). 
In Study A2301, 44 patients with measurable brain metastasis at baseline and at least one post-baseline 
brain radiological assessment (22 patients in the ceritinib arm and 22 patients in the chemotherapy 
arm) were assessed for intracranial response by BIRC neuro-radiologist per modified RECIST 1.1 (i.e. 
up to 5 lesions in the brain). The overall intracranial response rate (OIRR) was higher with ceritinib 
(72.7%, 95% CI: 49.8, 89.3) as compared to the chemotherapy arm (27.3%, 95% CI: 10.7, 50.2). 
The median PFS by BIRC using RECIST 1.1 was longer in the ceritinib arm compared to the 
chemotherapy arm in both subgroups of patients with brain metastases and without brain metastases. 
The median PFS in patients with brain metastases was 10.7 months (95% CI: 8.1, 16.4) versus 
6.7 months (95% CI: 4.1, 10.6) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively, with HR=0.70 
(95% CI: 0.44, 1.12). The median PFS in patients without brain metastases was 26.3 months (95% CI: 
15.4, 27.7) versus 8.3 months (95% CI: 6.0, 13.7) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, 
respectively, with HR=0.48 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.69).

Previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC - randomised phase 3 Study A2303 (ASCEND-5) 
The efficacy and safety of ceritinib for the treatment of ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients who 
have received previous treatment with crizotinib, was demonstrated in a global multicentre, 
randomised, open-label phase 3 Study A2303. 
A total of 231 patients with advanced ALK positive NSCLC who have received prior treatment with 
crizotinib and chemotherapy (one or two regimen including a platinum-based doublet) were included 
in the analysis. One hundred fifteen (115) patients were randomised to ceritinib and one hundred 
sixteen (116) were randomised to chemotherapy (either pemetrexed or docetaxel). Seventy-three (73) 
patients received docetaxel and 40 received pemetrexed. In the ceritinib arm, 115 patients were treated 
with 750 mg once daily fasted. The median age was 54.0 years (range: 28 to 84 years); 77.1% of 
patients were younger than 65 years. A total of 55.8% of patients were female. 64.5% of the study 
population were Caucasian, 29.4% Asian, 0.4% Black and 2.6% other races. The majority of patients 
had adenocarcinoma (97.0%) and had either never smoked or were former smokers (96.1%). The 
ECOG performance status was 0/1/2 in 46.3%/47.6%/6.1% of patients respectively, and 58.0% had 
brain metastasis at baseline. All patients were treated with prior crizotinib. All except one patient 
received prior chemotherapy (including a platinum doublet) for advanced disease; 11.3% of the 
patients in the ceritinib arm and 12.1% of the patients in the chemotherapy arm were treated with two 
prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease. 
Patients were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond initial progression in case of 
continued clinical benefit as per the investigator's opinion. Patients randomised to the chemotherapy 
arm could further crossover to receive ceritinib upon RECIST-defined disease progression confirmed 
by BIRC. 
The median duration of follow-up was 16.5 months (from randomisation to data cut-off date). 
The study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS by 
BIRC with an estimated 51% risk reduction in the ceritinib arm compared to chemotherapy arm (see 
Table 4 and Figure 3). The PFS benefit of ceritinib was consistent across various subgroups including 
age, gender, race, smoking class, ECOG performance status, and presence of brain metastases or prior 
response to crizotinib. The PFS benefit was further supported by local investigator assessment, and 
analysis of overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). 
OS data was immature with 48 (41.7%) events in the ceritinib arm and 50 (43.1%) events in the 
chemotherapy arm, corresponding to approximately 50% of the required events for the final OS 
analysis. In addition, 81 patients (69.8%) in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent ceritinib as 
first antineoplastic therapy after study treatment discontinuation. 
Efficacy data from Study A2303 are summarised in Table 4, and the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and 
OS are shown in Figure 3 and 4, respectively.

Patient reported outcome questionnaires were collected using the EORTC QLQ C30/LC13, LCSS and 
EQ-5D-5L. 75% or more of patients in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms completed the LCSS 
questionnaires at most of the time points during the course of the study. Significant improvements 
were reported for the majority of lung cancer specific symptoms for ceritinib compared to 
chemotherapy (four out of six LCSS and 10 out of 12 QLQ-LC13 symptom scores). Ceritinib 
significantly prolonged time to deterioration for the lung cancer specific symptoms of interest of 
cough, pain and dyspnoea (composite endpoint LCSS: HR=0.40; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.65, median Time to 
Deterioration [TTD] 18.0 months [95% CI: 13.4, NE] in the ceritinib arm versus 4.4 months [95% CI: 
1.6, 8.6] in the chemotherapy arm; LC13: HR=0.34; 95% CI: 0.22, 0. 52, median TTD 11.1 months 
[95% CI: 7.1, 14.2] in the ceritinib arm versus 2.1 months [95% CI: 1.0, 5.6] in the chemotherapy 
arm). The EQ-5D questionnaire showed a significant overall health status improvement for ceritinib in 
comparison to the chemotherapy. 
In Study A2303, 133 patients with baseline brain metastasis (66 patients in the ceritinib arm and 
67 patients in the chemotherapy arm) were assessed for intracranial response by BIRC neuro-
radiologist (per modified RECIST 1.1 (i.e. up to 5 lesions in the brain). The OIRR in patients with 
measurable disease in the brain at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment was higher in the 
ceritinib arm (35.3%, 95% CI: 14.2, 61.7) compared to the chemotherapy arm (5.0%, 95% CI: 0.1, 
24.9). The median PFS by BIRC using RECIST 1.1 was longer in the ceritinib arm compared to the 
chemotherapy arm in both subgroups of patients with brain metastases and without brain metastases. 
The median PFS in patients with brain metastases was 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.4, 6.2) versus 
1.5 months (95% CI: 1.3, 1.8) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively with HR=0.54 
(95% CI: 0.36, 0.80). The median PFS in patients without brain metastases was 8.3 months (95% CI: 
4.1, 14.0) versus 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.4, 4.1) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively 
with HR=0.41 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.69).

Dose optimisation Study A2112 (ASCEND-8) 
The efficacy of ceritinib 450 mg with food was evaluated in a multicentre, open-label dose 
optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8). A total of 147 previously untreated patients with 
ALK-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC were randomised to receive ceritinib 450 mg 
once daily with food (N=73) or ceritinib 750 mg once daily under fasted conditions (N=74). A key 
secondary efficacy endpoint was ORR according to RECIST 1.1 as evaluated by BIRC. 
The population characteristics of the previously untreated patients with ALK-positive locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC across the two arms, 450 mg with food (N=73) and 750 mg fasted 
(N=74),  were: mean age 54.3 and 51.3 years, age less than 65 (78.1% and 83.8%), female (56.2% and 
47.3%), Caucasian (49.3% and 54.1%), Asian (39.7% and 35.1%), never or former smoker (90.4% 
and 95.9%), WHO PS 0 or 1 (91.7% and 91.9%), adenocarcinoma histology (98.6% and 93.2%), and 
metastases to the brain (32.9% and 28.4%), respectively. 
Efficacy results from ASCEND-8 are summarised in Table 5 below.

Single arm studies X2101 and A2201 
The use of ceritinib in the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC patients previously treated with an ALK 
inhibitor was investigated in two global, multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase 1/2 studies 
(Study X2101 and Study A2201). 
In study X2101 a total of 246 ALK-positive NSCLC patients were treated at a ceritinib dose of 
750 mg once daily fasted: 163 who had received prior treatment with an ALK inhibitor and 83 who 
were ALK inhibitor naïve. Of the 163 ALK-positive NSCLC patients who had received prior 
treatment with an ALK inhibitor, the median age was 52 years (range: 24-80 years); 86.5% were 
younger than 65 years and 54% were female. The majority of patients were Caucasian (66.3%) or 
Asian (28.8%). 93.3% had adenocarcinoma and 96.9% had either never been or were former smokers. 
All of the patients were treated with at least one regimen prior to enrolment into the study and 84.0% 
with two or more regimens. 
Study A2201 involved 140 patients who had been previously treated with 1-3 lines of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy followed by treatment with crizotinib, and who had then progressed on crizotinib. The 
median age was 51 years (range: 29-80 years); 87.1% of patients were younger than 65 years and 
50.0% were female. The majority of patients were Caucasian (60.0%) or Asian (37.9%). 92.1% of 
patients had adenocarcinoma.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Peak plasma levels (Cmax) of ceritinib are achieved approximately 4 to 6 hours after a single oral 
administration in patients. Oral absorption was estimated to be ≥25% based on metabolite percentages 
in the faeces. The absolute bioavailability of ceritinib has not been determined. 
Systemic exposure of ceritinib was increased when administered with food. Ceritinib AUCinf values 
were approximately 39% and 64% higher (Cmax approximately 42% and 58% higher) in healthy 
subjects when a single 750 mg ceritinib dose (tablet) was administered with a low fat meal (containing 
approximately 330 kcalories and 9 grams of fat) and a high fat meal (containing approximately 
1000 kcalories and 58 grams of fat), respectively, as compared with the fasted state. 
In a dose optimisation study A2112 (ASCEND-8) in patients comparing ceritinib 450 mg or 600 mg 
daily with food (approximately 100 to 500 kcalories and 1.5 to 15 grams of fat) to 750 mg daily under 
fasted conditions (dose and food condition of administration initially authorised), there was no 
clinically meaningful difference in the systemic steady-state exposure of ceritinib for the 450 mg with 
food arm (N=36) compared to the 750 mg fasted arm (N=31), with only small increases in steady-state 
AUC (90% CI) by 4% (-13%, 24%) and Cmax (90% CI) by 3% (-14%, 22%). In contrast, the 
steady-state AUC (90% CI) and Cmax (90% CI) for the 600 mg with food arm (N=30) increased by 
24% (3%, 49%) and 25% (4%, 49%), respectively, compared to the 750 mg fasted arm. The maximum 
recommended dose of ceritinib is 450 mg taken orally once daily with food (see section 4.2). 
After single oral administration of ceritinib in patients, plasma exposure to ceritinib, as represented by 
Cmax and AUClast, increased dose-proportionally over the 50 to 750 mg dose range under fasted 
conditions. In contrast with single-dose data, pre-dose concentration (Cmin) after repeated daily dosing 
appeared to increase in a greater than dose-proportional manner. 
Distribution 
Binding of ceritinib to human plasma proteins in vitro is approximately 97% in a concentration 
independent manner, from 50 ng/ml to 10,000 ng/ml. Ceritinib also has a slight preferential 
distribution to red blood cells, relative to plasma, with a mean in vitro blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.35. 
In vitro studies suggest that ceritinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not of breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) or multi-resistance protein 2 (MRP2). The in vitro apparent passive 
permeability of ceritinib was determined to be low. 
In rats, ceritinib crosses the intact blood brain barrier with a brain-to-blood exposure (AUCinf) ratio of 
about 15%. There are no data related to brain-to-blood exposure ratio in humans. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A was the major enzyme involved in the metabolic clearance 
of ceritinib. 
Following a single oral administration of radioactive ceritinib dose at 750 mg fasted, ceritinib was the 
main circulating component in human plasma. A total of 11 metabolites were found circulating in 
plasma at low levels with mean contribution to the radioactivity AUC of ≤2.3% for each metabolite. 
Main biotransformation pathways identified in healthy subjects included mono-oxygenation, 
O-dealkylation, and N-formylation. Secondary biotransformation pathways involving the primary 
biotransformation products included glucuronidation and dehydrogenation. Addition of a thiol group 
to O-dealkylated ceritinib was also observed. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Following single oral doses of ceritinib under fasted conditions, the geometric mean apparent plasma 
terminal half-life (T½) of ceritinib ranged from 31 to 41 hours in patients over the 400 to 750 mg dose 
range. Daily oral dosing of ceritinib results in achievement of steady-state by approximately 15 days 
and remains stable afterwards, with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 6.2 after 3 weeks of daily 
dosing. The geometric mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ceritinib was lower at steady-state 
(33.2 litres/hour) after 750 mg daily oral dosing than after a single 750 mg oral dose (88.5 litres/hour), 
suggesting that ceritinib demonstrates non-linear pharmacokinetics over time. 
The primary route of excretion of ceritinib and its metabolites is in the faeces. Recovery of unchanged 
ceritinib in the faeces accounts for a mean 68% of an oral dose. Only 1.3% of the administered oral 
dose is recovered in the urine. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ceritinib (750 mg under 
fasted conditions) was evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A; N=8), moderate (Child-
Pugh class B; N=7), or severe (Child-Pugh class C; N=7) hepatic impairment and in 8 healthy subjects 
with normal hepatic function. The geometric mean AUCinf (unbound AUCinf) of ceritinib was 
increased by 18% (35%) and 2% (22%) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, 
respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. 
The geometric mean AUCinf (unbound AUCinf) of ceritinib was increased by 66% (108%) in subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (see section 4.2). A 
dedicated pharmacokinetic study under steady-state in patients with hepatic impairment has not been 
conducted. 
Renal impairment 
A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted. Based 
on available data, ceritinib elimination via the kidney is negligible (1.3% of a single oral administered 
dose). 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 345 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 
to <90 ml/min), 82 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <60 ml/min) and 546 patients 
with normal renal function (≥90 ml/min), ceritinib exposures were similar in patients with mild and 
moderate renal impairment and normal renal function, suggesting that no dose adjustment is necessary 
in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 
<30 ml/min) were not included in the clinical studies of ceritinib (see section 4.2). 
Effects of age, gender, and race 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that age, gender and race had no clinically meaningful 
influence on ceritinib exposure. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The potential for QT interval prolongation of ceritinib was assessed in seven clinical studies with 
ceritinib. Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-state to evaluate the effect 
of ceritinib on the QT interval in 925 patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg once daily fasted. A 
categorical outlier analysis of ECG data demonstrated new QTc >500 msec in 12 patients (1.3%). 
There were 58 patients (6.3%) with a QTc increase from baseline >60 msec. A central tendency 
analysis of the QTc data at average steady-state concentration from Study A2301 demonstrated that 
the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for QTc increase from baseline was 15.3 msec at ceritinib 
750 mg fasted. A pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that ceritinib causes concentration-dependent 
increases in QTc (see section 4.4). 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Safety pharmacology studies indicate that ceritinib is unlikely to interfere with vital functions of the 
respiratory and central nervous systems. In vitro data show that the IC50 for the inhibitory effect of 
ceritinib on the hERG potassium channel was 0.4 micromolar. An in vivo telemetry study in monkeys 
showed a modest QT prolongation in 1 of 4 animals after receiving the highest dose of ceritinib. ECG 
studies in monkeys after 4- or 13-weeks of dosing with ceritinib have not shown QT prolongation or 
abnormal ECGs. 
The micronucleus test in TK6 cells was positive. No signs of mutagenicity or clastogenicity were 
observed in other in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with ceritinib. Therefore, genotoxic risk is 
not expected in humans. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with ceritinib. 
Reproductive toxicology studies (i.e. embryo-foetal development studies) in pregnant rats and rabbits 
indicated no foetotoxicity or teratogenicity after dosing with ceritinib during organogenesis; however, 
maternal plasma exposure was less than that observed at the recommended human dose. Formal 
non-clinical studies on the potential effects of ceritinib on fertility have not been conducted. 
The principal toxicity related to ceritinib administration in rats and monkeys was inflammation of the 
extra-hepatic bile ducts accompanied by increased neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood. Mixed 
cell/neutrophilic inflammation of the extra-hepatic ducts extended to the pancreas and/or duodenum at 
higher doses. Gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in both species characterised by body weight loss, 
decreased food consumption, emesis (monkey), diarrhoea and, at high doses, by histopathological 
lesions including erosion, mucosal inflammation and foamy macrophages in the duodenal crypts and 
submucosa. The liver was also affected in both species, at exposures that approximate clinical 
exposures at the recommended human dose, and included minimal increases in liver transaminases in 
a few animals and vacuolation of the intra-hepatic bile duct epithelium. Alveolar foamy macrophages 
(confirmed phospholipidosis) were seen in the lungs of rats, but not in monkeys, and the lymph nodes 
of rats and monkeys had macrophage aggregates. Target organ effects showed partial to complete 
recovery. 
Effects on the thyroid were observed in both rat (mild increases in thyroid stimulating hormone and 
triiodothyronine/thyroxine T3/T4 concentrations with no microscopic correlate) and monkey 
(depletion of colloid in males in 4-week study, and one monkey at high dose with diffuse follicular 
cell hyperplasia and increased thyroid stimulating hormone in 13-week study). As these non-clinical 
effects were mild, variable and inconsistent, the relationship between ceritinib and thyroid gland 
changes in animals is unclear.

1.  What Zykadia is and what it is used for 
What Zykadia is 
Zykadia is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance ceritinib. It is used to treat adults with 
advanced stages of a form of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Zykadia is only 
given to patients whose disease is due to a defect in a gene called ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). 
How Zykadia works 
In patients with ALK defects, an abnormal protein is produced that stimulates the growth of the cancer 
cells. Zykadia blocks the action of this abnormal protein and thus slows down the growth and spread 
of NSCLC. 
If you have any questions about how Zykadia works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Zykadia

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure whether your medicine is one of the medicines listed 
above. 
These medicines should be used with care or may need to be avoided during your treatment with 
Zykadia. If you are taking any of these, your doctor might need to prescribe an alternative medicine 
for you. 
You should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Zykadia and you are prescribed a new 
medicine that you have not already taken at the same time as Zykadia. 
Oral contraceptives 
If you take Zykadia whilst using oral contraceptives, the oral contraceptives may become ineffective. 
Zykadia with food and drink 
You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice during treatment. It may make the amount of 
Zykadia in your blood increase to a harmful level. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You must use a highly effective method of birth control during treatment with Zykadia and for 
3 months after stopping treatment. Talk to your doctor about the birth control methods that may be 
right for you. 
Zykadia is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential 
risk to the baby. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planing to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential 
risks of taking Zykadia during pregnancy. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Zykadia should not be used during breast-feeding. You and your doctor will decide together whether 
you should breast-feed or take Zykadia. You should not do both. 
Driving and using machines 
You should take special care when driving and using machines when taking Zykadia as you may 
experience visual disturbances or tiredness. 
Zykadia contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Zykadia is and what it is used for 
What Zykadia is 
Zykadia is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance ceritinib. It is used to treat adults with 
advanced stages of a form of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Zykadia is only 
given to patients whose disease is due to a defect in a gene called ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). 
How Zykadia works 
In patients with ALK defects, an abnormal protein is produced that stimulates the growth of the cancer 
cells. Zykadia blocks the action of this abnormal protein and thus slows down the growth and spread 
of NSCLC. 
If you have any questions about how Zykadia works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
80

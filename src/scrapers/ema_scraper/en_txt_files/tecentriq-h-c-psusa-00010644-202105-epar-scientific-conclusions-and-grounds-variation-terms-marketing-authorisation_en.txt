Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for atezolizumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of the presented data on immune-related myocarditis from the company’s safety database, which 
retrieved 605 cases, with the exclusion of 18 cases due to onset prior to treatment initiation, 1 case that 
had infectious aetiology and 13 that were reported with myositis or rhabdomyolysis, a total of 66 cases 
had high diagnostic score, including 2 fatal cases with confirmed autoimmune myocarditis, and 27 had 
corrective treatment with corticosteroids. After reviewing the available data, the PRAC concluded that the 
product information should be amended in order to include a recommendation to permanently discontinue 
atezolizumab for ≥ Grade 2 myocarditis.  
Additionally, although the risk of diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is already included in 
the  SmPC  for  atezolizumab,  the  PRAC  concluded  that  the  package  leaflet  (PL)  should  be  amended  to 
include  specific  signs  of  DKA,  to  ensure  that  patients  are  fully  informed  of  the  risk  of  DKA  and  of  the 
particular signs to be aware of. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for atezolizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing atezolizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

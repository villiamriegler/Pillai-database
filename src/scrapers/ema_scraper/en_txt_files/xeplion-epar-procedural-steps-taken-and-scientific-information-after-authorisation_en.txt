Previous oral paliperidone or risperidone can be 
discontinued at the time of initiation of treatment with 
Xeplion injection. However, patients on higher doses (e.g. 
9-12 mg daily) may benefit from gradual withdrawal due to 
a potentially lower exposure with Xeplion, and risk for 
relapse, during the first 6 months after the switch, 
especially after gluteal injection. Therefore, alternatively, it

the company, the CHMP accepted the modification of the 
second initiation dose window from ± 2 days to ± 4 days. 
Section 4.2 was updated as follows: 
- It is recommended that the second initiation dose of 
XEPLION be given one week after the first dose. To avoid a 
missed dose, patients may be given the second dose 4 
days before or after the one-week (day 8) time point. 
Similarly, the third and subsequent injections after the 
initiation regimen are recommended to be given monthly. 
To avoid a missed monthly dose, patients may be given the 
injection up to 7 days before or after the monthly time 
point. 
If the target date for the second XEPLION injection (day 8 
± 4 days) is missed, the recommended reinitiation depends 
on the length of time which has elapsed since the patient's 
first injection.

patients taking risperidone. While no reports were received 
for paliperidone, there is a biological plausibility that IFIS 
can occur also in paliperidone treated patients, as 
paliperidone is a derivative of risperidone and since both 
agents bind and block α1 adrenergic receptors, a known 
mechanism for this adverse drug reaction. Therefore, the 
CHMP agreed to add IFIS as an adverse drug reaction and 
to include a related warning in the product information of 
both risperidone and paliperidone containing medicinal 
products. The CHMP furthermore agreed to the distribution 
of a communication to ophthalmologists to alert them of 
this new risk.

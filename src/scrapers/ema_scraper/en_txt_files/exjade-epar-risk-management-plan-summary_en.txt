Recommended initial daily dose: 7 mg/kg body weight. Dose adjustments in 
steps  of  3.5  - 7 mg/kg/day  may  be considered  every  3  - 6 months.  Doses 
above 14 mg/kg are not recommended because there is no experience with 
doses above this level in patients with NTDT syndromes. In patients in whom 
LIC  was  not  assessed  and  serum  ferritin  is  ≤ 2000 µg/L,  as  well  as  in 
pediatric patients, dosing should not exceed 7 mg/kg. For patients in whom 
the dose was increased to > 7 mg/kg, dose reduction to 7 mg/kg or less is 
recommended when LIC is < 7 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin is ≤ 2000 µg/L.
Exjade Dispersible Tablet (DT) has been discontinued in the EU markets and 
is  therefore  no  longer available  for  patients.  However,  generic  versions  of 
deferasirox DT may be available.
In  case  of  switching  patients  between  Exjade  FCT/granules  and  generic 
versions of deferasirox DT, the dose of the Exjade FCT/granules should be 
adjusted.

Part  II  Safety  specification  Module  SI:  Epidemiology  of  the 
indication(s) and target population
2.1
Indication
Deferasirox is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions 
(transfusional  hemosiderosis)  in  patients  with  thalassemia,  sickle  cell  disease  (SCD), 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or other rare anemias, and for the treatment of chronic iron 
overload in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia syndromes.
Incidence and prevalence:
Transfusional  iron  overload: Patients  with  conditions  leading  to  chronic  anemia  develop 
transfusional iron overload as a consequence of  multiple blood transfusions. The underlying 
conditions include beta-thalassemia, SCD, MDS, Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) and other 
anemias.
Beta-thalassemia
the  United  Kingdom  (UK) 
Beta-thalassemia is prevalent in the Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, Central Asia, 
India, Southern China, and the Far East as well as countries along the north coast of Africa and 
South America. The highest carrier frequency is reported in Cyprus (14%), Sardinia (10.3%) 
and Southeast Asia (Flint et al 1998). The total annual incidence of symptomatic individuals is 
estimated  at  1  in  100000  throughout  the  world  and  1  in  10000  people  in  the  EU 
(Galanello and Origa 2010).  In 
there  are  approximately 
800 transfusion dependent patients with homozygote beta-thalassemia and it is estimated that 
there  are  30000  to  60000 births  per  year  worldwide with  the  condition  (Walker 2002).  A 
neonatal screening program in Oman utilizing cord blood samples was conducted to evaluate 
the  incidence  of  hemoglobinopathies.  A  total  of  7837 neonates  were  studied.  The one  year 
estimated incidence of beta-thalassemia trait was 26 per 1000 neonates (Alkindi et al 2010). 
Population  migration  and  intermarriage  between  different  ethnic  groups  has  introduced 
thalassemia in almost every country of the world, including Northern Europe where thalassemia 
was  previously  absent  (Galanello and Origa 2010).  A  report  from  the  World  Health 
Organization (WHO) on the epidemiology of hemoglobin (Hb) disorders showed the following 
estimations (Table 2-1,  Modell and Darlison 2008).

In Europe, the prevalence of affected conceptions for beta-thalassemia varies between regions 
with  a  higher  prevalence  in  some  Southern  countries  (Cyprus  5.63  per  1000 conceptions, 
Greece 0.96, Albania 0.65) and lower prevalence observed in Northern and Western countries 
(Austria, Finland and Ireland 0.01 per 1000 conceptions, (Table 2-2, Modell et al 2007). The 
National Registry for Haemoglobinopathies in Greece recorded 2485 patients with thalassemia 
major  and  of  this,  88  births  with  hemoglobinopathy  during  the  period  2000-2010 
(Voskaridou et al 2012).
Sickle cell disease
There are approximately four million people with SCD worldwide (Locke 2009). Each year in 
Africa,  about  300000  infants  are  born  with  major  Hb  disorders,  including  more  than 
200000 infants with SCD. In some areas of sub-Saharan Africa, up to 2% of all children are 
born  with  the  condition  (Creary  et  al 2007).  In  the  UK,  there  are  12000-15000  affected 
individuals with SCD (UK Obstetric Surveillance System 2010). According to the centers for 
disease  control  and  prevention  (CDC  2012),  SCD  affects  an  estimated  90000  to 
100000 Americans. The disease occurs in about 1 out of every 500 African Americans births 
and in about 1 out of every 36000 Hispanic Americans births. Sickle cell trait occurs in about 
1 in 12 African Americans.
Sickle cell disease is prevalent in peoples whose ancestors came from sub-Saharan Africa, India, 
Saudi  Arabia  and  Mediterranean  countries.  The  estimated  prevalence  of  conceptions  with 
significant Hb gene variants for SCD in Europe is widely variable (0.03 per 1000 in Finland to 
0.99 in Albania) (Table 2-2, Modell et al 2007). In Greece, the number of patients with SCD 
recorded until 2010 by the National Registry for Haemoglobinopathies is 1080 and the number 
of affected births for the period 2000-2010 was 43 (Voskaridou et al 2012).
Myelodysplastic syndrome
Based on 1806 cases from 26 counties in the UK, an incidence of 3.6 per 100000 was estimated 
among those less than 80 years old. Men had higher incidence rates than women (4.69 and 2.51, 
respectively),  with  the  highest  rates  found  in  the  75- to  79-year  age  group  (18.22) 
(Strom et al 2008).
Based  on  the  Dusseldorf  MDS  registry,  researchers  in  2004  reported  a  crude  incidence  of 
4.9 per  100000  (5.5  in  men  and  4.36  in  women)  for  1991 to 2001.  In  the  United  States  of 
America (USA),  the  crude  incidence  rate  for  MDS,  excluding  chronic  myelomonocytic 
leukemia (CMML), for the 3-year period was 3.4 per 100000 (4.5 in men and 2.7 in women) 
(Strom et al 2008).
Another study in the US showed that from 2003 to 2007 there were approximately 59722 cases 
of MDS throughout the US, averaging an estimated 11945 cases per year. For 2003 to 2007, the 
incidence  of  MDS  (per  100000)  was  reported  as  follows  (males  versus  [vs]  females  in 
parentheses): all races, 4.3 (5.8 vs. 3.3); blacks, 3.7 (4.6 vs. 3.3); whites, 4.3 (6.0 vs. 3.3). The 
overall incidence rate for MDS is 4.3 cases per 100000 population. For the five-year period 
in  males 
from  2003 
(averaging 6622 per year) and a total of 26664 cases in females (averaging 5333 per year). This 
results in an incidence rate of 5.8 per 100000 population for males and a much lower 3.3 per 
100000 population in females (Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 2011).

A study in Sweden investigated the incidence of MDS between 1970 and 1992. The overall 
incidence in this period was 3.6 per 100000 person years. The incidence in people aged 70 and 
more was 15.0 in 100000 person-years, being the average age of 74.1 for males and 78.2 for 
females (Radlund et al 1995).
The  1995-2002  MDS  incidence  rates  per  100000  inhabitant-years  adjusted  to  the  European 
population and its corresponding 95% confidence interval in the EU and according to European 
region were (RARECARE project Executive Agency for Health and Consumers [EAHC] of the 
European Commission):
 EU (crude rate): 1.50, 1.47-1.53
 Northern Europe (Iceland, Norway, Sweden): 0.75, 0.71-0.80
 Central Europe (Belgium, Austria, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland): 0.26,
0.24-0.28
 Eastern Europe (Poland, Slovakia): 0.10, 0.08-0.12
 Southern Europe (Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain): 0.38, 0.36-0.41
 UK (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) and Ireland (Republic of Ireland):
2.15, 2.11-2.20
About 80 to 85% of patients will receive blood transfusions at some point, often in the order of 
2 units every 2 to 6 weeks (Malcovati 2007).
Diamond-Blackfan anemia
Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a very rare condition with approximately 350 known cases in the 
US  and  Canada.  It  can  be  assumed  that  all  patients  are  at  risk  of  iron  overload  from  blood 
transfusions.
Retrospective  studies  in  the  UK  and  the  Netherlands  are  consistent  with  an  incidence  of 
4 to 5 per million live births with evidence of inheritance (dominant and recessive) in perhaps 
12% to 25% of cases. The true incidence is difficult to ascertain, because of the protean clinical 
manifestations and the wide age range at presentation. Patients are increasingly diagnosed in 
early infancy, either with characteristic physical findings or on the basis of a positive family 
history. A proportion of infants may also present with hematological abnormalities during the 
first year of life. The majority of patients, however, are diagnosed between age 4 and 14 years, 
and 10% at over 16 years (Sieff et al 2000).
The estimated incidence of DBA in France is 7.3 cases per million live births over the 13-year 
study period (Willig et al 1999).
Diamond-Blackfan  anemia is  a rare  condition, with no focal point for the collection of case 
prevalence data worldwide.
Demographics of the population in the authorized indication – age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:
A study in 924 Thalassemia major patients in Italy found that the mean age of patients at the 
time of the study was 30.1 (9.1 years) -99.3% were aged 18 and older- with an approximately 
equal male and female distribution 48.8% and 51.2%, respectively (Piga et al 2013).

Thalassemia is an inherited disease in a Mendelian-recessive manner such that asymptomatic 
heterozygous  parents, or  carriers, both pass on one  copy  of  a  gene  for  a  Hb  variant to their 
children (Weatherall 2012).
The main existing treatment options:
In  beta-thalassemia,  transfusions  have  the  goal  of  correction  of  anemia,  suppression  of 
erythropoiesis and inhibition of gastrointestinal iron absorption, which occurs in non-transfused 
patients as a consequence of increased, although ineffective erythropoiesis. Several transfusion 
regimens have been proposed. The most widely accepted aims at pre-transfusional Hb level of 
9 to 10 g/dL and post-transfusion level of 13 to 14 g/dL. The frequency of transfusion is every 
two to four weeks. The amount of blood to be transfused depends on several factors including 
weight of the patient, target increase in Hb level and hematocrit of blood unit. In general the 
amount of transfused RBC should not exceed 15 to 20 ml/kg/day, infused at a maximum rate 
of 5 ml/kg/hour, to avoid fast increase in blood volume (Galanello and Origa 2010).

Despite  therapeutic  progress,  Stem  Cell  Transplantation  (SCT)  remains  the  only  curative 
treatment available today. Although more than 90% of patients who receive a transplant from a 
human  leukocyte  antigen (HLA)-identical  related  donor  are  surviving  and  80-90%  of  them 
become disease-free, there are still some uncertainties how the curative, but potentially lethal 
SCT, can be applied for adults and patients with advanced disease or those having a matched 
unrelated donor (Aydinok 2012).
Sickle cell disease
The mainstay of therapy for pain episodes is supportive: hydration, anti-inflammatory agents 
and  pain  medication  (e.g.  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  [NSAIDs]  and  narcotic 
analgesia). Early prevention of pulmonary infections and prompt evaluation and treatment of 
underlying infections are essential. Life-threatening or severe complications are often treated 
with transfusions to reduce the percentage of Hb S while increasing oxygen carrying capacity 
of the blood (Bender and Hobbs 2013).
Chronic RBC transfusion therapy is used to maintain the percentage of Hb S below 30% and 
suppress reticulocytosis. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the most frequently prescribed therapy for SCD 
to induce synthesis of Hb F, to decrease sickling, improve red-cell survival, lowering the white 
blood  cell  count  and  platelet  count,  and  reducing  vascular  inflammation.  Stem  cell 
transplantation from a normal donor or one with sickle cell trait can be curative in individuals 
with SCD (Bender and Hobbs 2013).
Myelodysplastic syndrome
Until  recently,  there  were  no  approved  drugs  for  the  treatment  of  MDS.  Supportive  care 
measures (e.g. transfusion of blood products, hematopoietic growth factors and antimicrobials) 
remained the mainstay of therapy. Within the last 6 years, two agents have been approved by 
the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA) and  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA) for  the 
treatment of MDS: the immunomodulating agent, lenalidomide and the hypomethylating agent, 
azacitidine  and  the  FDA  also  approved  decitabine,  which  is  also  a  hypomethylating  agent. 
These  agents  have  dramatically  changed  both the  course  of  treatment  for  MDS  and  patient 
outcomes. (NCCN 2015, Malcovati et al 2013, Bryan et al 2010).
Treatment of lower-risk MDS include:
 Supportive Care: RBC transfusions and iron chelation therapy, erythropoiesis-stimulating
agents,  such  as  recombinant  human  erythropoietin  or  darbepoetin  alfa,  granulocyte
colony-stimulating factors
Immunosuppressive therapy

 Lenalidomide, thalidomide, anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine A

At presentation the majority of patients require stabilization with red cell transfusion. Steroids 
have been found to affect linear growth and physical and neurocognitive development in infants. 
Thus  to  delay  the  start  of  corticosteroids  and  transfusions  is  the  treatment  of  preference. 
Transfusions are indicated at Hb levels of 8 g/dL with 10 to 15 mL/kg of leukocyte-depleted, 
packed RBC (Vlachos and Muir 2010). Patients receiving chronic red cell transfusion therapy 
generally require transfusion of 10 to 15 mL/kg every 3 to 5 weeks to maintain Hb levels above 
8 g/dL.
Stem cell transplantation is the only definitive treatment for the hematologic manifestations of 
DBA. Allogeneic matched sibling HSCT has been very successful. Data from the DBA registry 
study revealed an overall survival of 77.3% ± 8.3% for sibling HSCT and 31.5% ± 12.7% for 
alternative donor HSCT (Vlachos and Muir 2010). Other therapies with androgens, high dose 
corticosteroids,  erythropoietin,  Interleukin-3,  cyclosporine ± prednisone,  metoclopromide, 
valproic acid, and leucine have been used over the last 30 years, but most of them have been 
ineffective (Vlachos et al 2008).

Beta-thalassemia
There  has  been  a  steady  improvement  in  survival  following  the  introduction  of  effective 
chelation therapy with DFO during the 1980’s. Table 2-4 shows the principal causes of death 
in  50 patients  from  a  cohort  of  720 patients  with  beta-thalassemia  born  after 1970 
(Borgna-Pignatti et al 2004):

Thus, the majority of deaths are due to cardiac events. In this cohort 70% of patients were still 
alive at 35 years of age (Borgna-Pignatti et al 2004).
A Greek study reported the mortality ratios of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients 
compared with the general population. The standardized mortality ratio improved significantly 
from 28.9 in 1990-1999 to 13.5 in 2000-2010. While the cardiac mortality standardized ratio 
decreased from 322.9 to 106.6 in the same periods. At the age of 50 years, the overall survival 
was 65% (Ladis et al 2011). A later analysis of these Greek data reported the causes of death 
from Thalassemia in patients between the years 2000 and 2010.

The main causes of death were (Voskaridou et al 2012):
 Heart disease (52.3%)
 Liver carcinoma (13.8%)
 Microbial infections (8.0%)
 Malignancy (6.3%)
 Stroke (5.2%)
 Other causes (4.0%)
 Unknown causes (3.4%)
 Pulmonary disease (1.2%)
 Renal failure (1.2%)
The analysis of 447 transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients in Egypt during 10 years 
of follow-up showed that the most common morbidities were endocrine (44.7%) followed by 
cardiovascular (41.3%) and renal (4%). The overall mortality rate was 1.5% in the observation 
period  2000-2010.  The  5,  10  and  20 years  survival  proportions  were  80%,  50%  and  20% 
respectively (Mokhtar et al 2013).
Sickle cell disease
In a cohort of 3764 patients, there were 209 deaths. Median age at death was 42 years in males 
and  48 years  in  females  with  homozygous  SCD  but  was  60  and  68 years,  respectively,  in 
patients  with  sickle  cell-hemoglobin  C  disease.  Eighteen  percent  of  deaths  occurred  in 
chronically  ill  patients  with  clinical  organ  failure,  predominantly  renal,  cardiac  failure  or 
chronic debilitating cerebrovascular accident. Thirty-three percent of patients died during sickle 
crises, mainly acute chest syndrome and stroke. The major cause of death in SCD <20 years of 
age  is  pneumococcal  sepsis,  possibly  as  a  result  of  splenic  atrophy  (Platt  et  al  1994).  The 
analysis  of  the  mortality  and  causes  of  death  in  SCD patients  in  the  Netherlands  before  the 
introduction of neonatal screening provided the following results (Table 2-5, Van der Plas et 
al 2011):


β-Thalassemia  Intermedia:  This  form  occurs  at  a  low  and  varying  frequency  in  every
population with a high frequency of β-thalassemia and is particularly common in parts of
Africa where mild β-thalassemia alleles predominate.
 Hemoglobin E β-Thalassemia: This condition is by far the most common form of severe
thalassemia in the populations of East India, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia.
 Hemoglobin H Disease: This disorder, caused by the inactivation of 3 α-globin genes, is
most common in Southeast Asia and it occurs sporadically in most other tropical regions.
 Hemoglobin  S  β-Thalassemia:  The  co-inheritance  of  the  sickle  cell  gene  with  a
β-thalassemia allele is most prevalent in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, though it may also
occur in the Mediterranean region, Middle East, and parts of India where the sickle cell gene
is common. Because the majority of β-thalassemia alleles in Africa are mild, this condition
tends to be extremely mild in African populations.
 Hemoglobin C Thalassemia: This disorder is restricted to localized regions of sub-Saharan
and North Africa and it is characterized by a mild form of NTDT.
Risk factors for the disease
Thalassemia is an inherited disease in a Mendelian-recessive manner such that asymptomatic 
heterozygous parents, or carriers, both pass on one copy of a gene for an Hb variant to their 
children. Several genetic and environmental modifiers have been identified which can explain

in  NTDT  compared 
to  other  regularly 
independence 
The main existing treatment options:
Treatment of patients with NTDT relies primarily on expert opinion and data from observational 
studies, with only few randomized clinical trials conducted to date (Musallam et al 2013). Aside 
from management of specific complications, the following general approaches are used:
 Splenectomy: can increase total Hb level by 1-2 g/dL and avoid blood transfusion therapy,
however, can put the patient to a high risk of morbidity and mortality due to infection and
multiplicity of adverse events (AEs).
 Transfusion therapy: NTDT patients may still require occasional blood transfusions during

infection, pregnancy, surgery or any setting with anticipated blood loss.
Iron chelation therapy: it is indicated in NTDT patients aged 10 years or above (or 15 years
and  over  in  deletional  hemoglobin  H  disease)  and  having  liver  iron  concentration  levels
5 mg  Fe/g  dw  (or  serum  ferritin  level  ≥ 800 ng/mL  when  liver  iron  concentration
measurement is unavailable) as these thresholds indicate increased iron related morbidity
risk.
 Fetal Hb induction: several fetal Hb inducers (e.g. HU) have been shown to increase total
Hb  level  in  small  trials  including  NTDT  populations;  however,  such  treatment  options
remain investigational.

 Diabetes mellitus 5.7%
Important co-morbidities:
Across all target populations, patients who require regular blood transfusions will inevitably 
accumulate excess iron in the form of hemosiderin at toxic and ultimately lethal quantities in 
the heart, liver and endocrine organs. Target populations include thalassemia, SCD, MDS and 
DBA. Without chelation therapy to remove excess iron, regularly transfused patients acquire 
toxic  accumulations  of  iron  within  3  to  10  years  (Gabutti  and  Piga 1996)  resulting  in  iron 
induced tissue damage and organ failure. The majority of transfused beta-thalassemia patients 
receive chelation therapy. However, the rate of chelation therapy in other diseases that require 
regular transfusions is currently much lower. Despite their transfusion independence, patients 
with NTDT can still accumulate iron due to increased intestinal iron absorption. Cumulative 
iron  overload  may  reach  clinically  significant  levels  and  has  been  associated  with  hepatic, 
vascular, endocrine, and bone disease. Such iron-overload related morbidities start appearing 
beyond 10 years of age (Musallam et al 2013).

Osteoporosis 
(Schrier and Angelucci 2005). The causes are multi-factorial and include endocrinopathies and 
bone thinning due to bone marrow expansion which occurs in an effort to produce enough red 
cells. Chronic hemolysis can cause splenomegaly and hypersplenism, with the development of 
increasing  leukopenia  and  thrombocytopenia.  Splenectomy  may  be  indicated  which  is 
associated with a markedly increased risk of overwhelming infections, especially septicemia, 
despite the use of immunization strategies and prophylactic antibiotics. Thalassemia patients 
also  have  an  increased  risk  of  thrombosis  which  may  be  aggravated  by  post-splenectomy 
thrombocytosis.

Regarding  kidney  stones,  a  retrospective  cohort  study  in  166 participants  with  transfusion 
dependent thalassemia who had undergone dual-energy Xray absorptiometry between 2009 and 
2011 in Australia, found a high prevalence of kidney stones (18.1%) which was greater in males 
compared to females (28.7 vs 9.7% respectively, Wong et al 2013).
Co-morbidity in sickle cell disease
Gallstone formation has been reported in 35% to 50% of children with SCD (Edwards 2002).
The sickled red cells can aggregate into large masses which obstruct blood vessels and result in 
pain and damage to tissues and organs. These so-called ‘sickle cell crises’ can affect a variety 
of organs including acute splenic or hepatic sequestration (where there is massive enlargement 
of the respective organ due to the accumulation of sickled red cells), acute chest syndrome (with 
dyspnea  and  pleuritic  pain),  cerebrovascular  injury  including  stroke  and  seizures,  priapism, 
avascular necrosis of bone, and sickle cell retinopathy. These episodes can be rapidly fatal or 
lead to death due to progressive organ failure when repeated episodes occur during the patient’s 
lifetime (Platt et al 1994). In one study, 61% of transfused SCD patients reported a history of 
stroke  (Fung  et  al 2007).  Repeated  splenic  infarcts  can  result  in  splenic  atrophy  and  such 
patients are at high risk of overwhelming infection.
Furthermore,  SCD  patients  are  particularly  at  risk  of  progressive  renal  dysfunction  termed 
sickle  cell  nephropathy  which  affects  5%  to  18%  of  the  population  (Scheinman 2003).  In  a 
prospective study of 964 adults with SCD, overall mortality was 18% and includes renal failure 
in 40% of patients at the time of death (or 7.6% of the total) (Platt et al 1994).
Co-morbidity in myelodysplastic syndrome
Myelodysplastic syndrome is associated with bone marrow insufficiency leading to peripheral 
blood cytopenias which can affect one or more cell lines. Patients are generally anemic (hence 
the need for regular blood transfusions); leucopenia and thrombocytopenia expose patients to 
the risks of severe infections and bleeding. Myelodysplastic syndrome affects predominantly 
elderly  patients  who  are  at  risk  for  co-morbidities  that  occur  with  aging,  including 
cardiovascular  diseases,  chronic  pulmonary  disorders,  diabetes,  osteoporosis  and  renal 
impairment. Patients with MDS will generally develop acute myeloid leukemia if death does 
not occur earlier due to a concomitant illness. A study in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database found that MDS patients with comorbid conditions 
had  significantly  greater  risk  of  death  than  those  without  comorbidities.  Among  1708  MDS 
patients  diagnosed  between  2001  and  2002  the  major  comorbidities  found  were  diabetes, 
congestive  heart  failure,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  cardiovascular  disease  and 
peripheral vascular disease (Wang et al 2009).
Co-morbidity in Diamond-Blackfan anemia
Patients  with  DBA  frequently  have  congenital  malformations,  including  craniofacial 
malformations, urogenital malformations and cardiac defects. The condition is often associated 
with growth retardation and symptoms secondary to anemia in children. Patients with DBA are 
also at higher risk of developing leukemia and other malignancies (Vlachos et al 2008).

Relevance to human usage
Increased serum creatinine, acute renal failure (ARF) and renal 
tubular  disorders  including  Fanconi’s  syndrome  and  renal 
tubular necrosis have been observed in humans.
Lens opacities have been observed in humans.
Cholelithiasis,  raised  transaminases,  hepatitis  and  hepatic 
failure have been observed in humans.
GI  hemorrhage  and  ulcers  (including  GI  perforation)  and 
esophagitis have been observed in humans.
It is not known if deferasirox is secreted into human maternal 
milk.
No  dedicated  clinical  trial  data  on  exposed  pregnancies  were 
achieved  for  deferasirox.  The  potential  risk  for  humans  is 
unknown. As a precaution, it is recommended that deferasirox 
not  be  used  during  pregnancy  unless  clearly  necessary

Relevance to human usage
These  data  support  the  use  of  deferasirox  in  children  aged 
2 years old and above.
These data were not confirmed with drug-drug interaction (DDI) 
study  results  in  healthy  subjects.  Deferasirox  affects  various 
CYP isoenzymes in clinical settings.
Key Safety findings
(from non-clinical studies)
An increase  in  stillborn  pups  and  decreased 
pup  weights  were  observed  at  a  dose  that 
induced  maternal 
toxicity  and  mortality 
(90 mg/kg/day) (Study 997055).
(Study 0480148), 
Juvenile toxicity:
In the juvenile rat (Study 0370030) and mouse 
studies 
target  organs 
identified were consistent with those observed 
in  adults.  The  maximum  tolerated  dose  in 
juvenile animals was lower than that in adult 
animals, due to higher exposure to deferasirox 
rather than increased sensitivity of tissues in 
juvenile animals.
of 
inducer 
Drug-drug interactions:
In vitro studies suggested that the potential of 
deferasirox does not appear to be an inhibitor, 
or 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
isoenzymes  as  well  as  hepatic  anion 
transporters (MRP2, MXR) in clinical settings, 
i.e.,  patients  receiving  multiple  daily  oral
dosing  of  20-40 mg/kg  deferasirox.  An
interaction between  deferasirox and  HU  in
sickle cell anemia patients is unlikely.

Part II Module SIV.2. Limitations to detect adverse reactions in 
clinical trial development programs
The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged 
exposure.
During  the  clinical  development  program,  8063 patients  have  been  exposed  to  deferasirox, 
comparator  or  placebo  cumulatively,  in  the  MAH-sponsored  global  and  local  interventional 
clinical trials as well as in compassionate use programs. Some patients were observed for safety 
follow-up  for  up  to  seven  years  in  the  clinical  trials,  and  there  were  no  new  adverse  drug 
reactions (ADRs) due to prolonged exposure of more than 12 months.
Deferasirox is not expected to cause ADRs due to its cumulative effect because deferasirox and 
its metabolites did not show unexpected accumulation in blood and tissues after multiple dosing.
Novartis
EU Safety Risk Management Plan version 21.2
Page 36 of 118
ICL670/deferasirox
Due to the well-known inherent limitations of clinical trial development programs in general 
ADRs with a long latency period are often not detected. However, Study CICL670E2422 is 
currently being conducted to study the long-term safety in pediatric NTDT patients aged 10 to 
17 years-old and safety of new formulation (FCT). The sixth Interim Safety Report summarizes 
the data as of 30-Jun-2019. Forty patients received at least 1 dose of deferasirox as of the cutoff 
date.  The  median  exposure  was  17.0 months  (range:  0.1 – 61.6 months).  Of  the  29 patients 
treated with DT, the median exposure was 17.5 months (range: 3.0 – 56.6 months), and of the 
11 patients treated with FCT, the median exposure was 14.7 months (range 0.1 61.6 months). 
Four patients overall were treated with DT or FCT (2 patients each) from 48 to ≥ 60 months. 
The observed AEs in Study CICL670E2422, which is currently ongoing, are in line with the 
known, most commonly observed AEs in this patient population.

Details
In  Study CICL670A2123  deferasirox was  associated  with  a  mild  reversible 
hemodynamic  effect  on  renal  function  in  patients  receiving  short  and  long-term 
treatment. The potential mechanism for ARF and renal tubular disorders is unknown.
In  thalassemia  patients  0.5%  of  patients  are  reported  to  develop  renal  tubular 
dysfunction and 3.1% of patients progressed to dialysis therapy and 8% had a reduced 
CrCl (Di Iorio et al 2002).
Renal tubular abnormalities, including increased urinary excretion of proteins and of 
tubular  enzymes,  have  been  reported  in  30%  of 250 patients  with  beta-thalassemia 
(Aldulak et al 2000; Koliakos et al 2003).
Progressive  renal  insufficiency,  generally  heralded  by  the  appearance  of  increasing 
proteinuria, hypertension and hematuria occurs in 5-18% of patients with SCD and can 
require  hemodialysis  or  renal  transplantation  and  contributes  to  18%  of  deaths  in 
patients older than 40 years. Acute renal failure has been described as part of a multi-
organ failure syndrome that accompanies pain crises in SCD patients and is present 
in 10% of patients hospitalized with SCD (Scheinman 2003). Renal failure contributes 
to 18% of deaths in SCD patients older than 40 years (Platt et al 1994). In SCD, 26% 
of  381 patients  were  reported  to  have  proteinuria,  13%  at  or  close  to  the  nephritic 
range.
Naqvi  et  al  (2011) reported  that  2.3%  of  MDS  patients  have  renal  disorders. 
Myelodysplastic  syndrome  patients  are  generally  elderly  and  have  serum  creatinine 
levels that are close to or slightly higher ULN due to the normal aging process.
Increased serum creatinine
Increased serum creatinine was reported as an AE in 10.2% of patients overall. The 
percentage of patients with AEs of increased creatinine increased with age (from 3.1% 
in  children  aged  2-< 6 years  old  to  16.1%  in  adults  aged  ≥ 65 years old).  The 
magnitude  of  the  creatinine  increases  was  generally  < 50%  in  comparison  to  the 
baseline  values.  The  creatinine  levels  generally  remained  within  the  normal  range. 
Creatinine  values  > ULN  were  infrequent  and  were  seen  most  frequently  in  elderly
patients  where  baseline  creatinine  levels  were  often  already  close  to  the  ULN. 
However,  the  values  were  generally  < 1.5 x ULN.  The  magnitude  of  the  creatinine 
elevations to > ULN in comparison to baseline were similar to those in patients in whom 
the increases remained within the normal range. Very few AEs relating to creatinine 
increases were severe, were judged to be serious or led to study drug discontinuation.
In most patients in whom creatinine increases were reported as an AE, dose reductions 
of 25% to 33% were performed which resulted in a complete or partial return to baseline 
levels  in  about  40%  of  patients.  Creatinine  levels  remained  stable  in  the  remaining 
patients,  albeit  at  an  increased  level  compared  to  baseline.  In  patients  in  whom 
treatment  with  deferasirox  was  temporarily  interrupted,  serum  creatinine  values 
returned to baseline, generally within a few weeks.
In patients receiving deferasirox DT doses > 30 mg/kg, an increased incidence of this 
AE was not observed.
In  Study CICL670A2123,  deferasirox  was  associated  with  a  mild  reversible 
hemodynamic  effect  on  renal  function  in  patients  receiving  short  and  long  term 
treatment.  Renal  parameters  remained  stable  between  Week 52  and  Week 104 
indicating no further decline in the renal function over time. The association between 
the renal parameters could not be discerned when absolute changes from baseline in 
serum creatinine and CrCl were plotted against glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma 
flow, and filtration fraction (FF). The findings observed from this study were consistent

Renal disorders 
(increased serum

failure, renal tubular 
disorders [acquired 
Fanconi’s syndrome])
with the five year renal data from the pivotal registration study, Study CICL670A0107,
indicating no progressive worsening of the renal function over time.
Acute renal failure
Although the overall frequency of patients with at least one of the AE terms included in 
the  standardized  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA)  queries 
(SMQs) ‘Acute renal failure’ was 4.7%, ARF was reported as such in only 3 patients, 
though none of these cases was assessed as related to deferasirox by the Investigator. 
Proteinuria was the most frequently reported AE and, as discussed under the identified 
risk ‘Renal tubular disorders’, there is heavy confounding for this parameter due to a 
high  background incidence  of  tubular  abnormalities in these  patients.  There  was  no 
age-relationship  and  a  low  discontinuation  rate  (primarily  due  to  proteinuria)  due  to 
these AEs.
This identified risk has been added to the RMP based on post-marketing reports where 
ARF has been reported, mainly in critically ill patients with multi-organ failure related to 
complications of the underlying disease. In an additional group of patients, ARF was 
reported based on quite minor increases in serum creatinine which occurred over the 
course  of  several  weeks.  Although  many  of  the  patients  with  ARF  had  alternative 
explanations for the reported findings, it is impossible to exclude a contributory role of 
deferasirox for all cases. In addition, the fact that there was a positive de-challenge in 
most  patients  is  suggestive  of  a  contributory  role  of  deferasirox  to  these  events.  In 
patients receiving deferasirox DT doses > 30 mg/kg, an increased incidence of this AE 
was not observed.
Renal tubular disorders
A nephropathy consisting of renal tubular degeneration, cytoplasmic vacuolization of 
cortical tubular epithelial cells and tubular necrosis was observed in non-clinical studies 
with deferasirox in several species.
Adverse events related to renal tubular disorders were reported in only a handful of 
patients in the studies included in these analyses. The abnormalities resolved rapidly 
(generally  within  a  few  days)  when  deferasirox  was  interrupted.  A  single  patient 
discontinued  study  drug  due  to  the  development  of  a  tubulopathy.  The  numbers  of 
patients with tubular abnormalities are too low to draw any conclusions with respect to 
a relationship to age.
It  appears  that  patients  with  beta-thalassemia  have a  high background incidence of 
tubulopathy. Reports in the literature involving approximately 250 patients in Turkey, 
Greece and  Thailand  have  documented  renal  tubular  abnormalities,  including  the 
increased urinary excretion of proteins and of tubular enzymes, in approximately one 
third  of  patients  with  beta-thalassemia  (Aldulak  et  al 2000,  Koliakos  et  al 2003, 
Sumboonnanonda et al 1998). The changes were attributed by the respective authors 
to oxidative damage caused by iron deposits in the kidney.
In patients receiving deferasirox DT doses > 30 mg/kg, an increased incidence of this 
AE was not observed.
In  Study  CICL670A2426,  a  Prescription Event  Monitoring  (PEM) study,  increased 
serum  creatinine  occurred  at  a  lower  frequency  (n=2,  1.6%  of  cohort).  One  event 
occurred in an adult patient and was assessed as probably related to deferasirox in 
this study; the serum creatinine at time of event was reported to be above the ULN 
(value prior to starting was within the normal range).
In Study CICL670AFR01T, in all age groups, the mean serum creatinine at baseline in 
the 5-year follow-up population was 62.2 (±23.3) μmol/l. This value was stable (relative 
change from baseline of between -33% and +33%) during visits at 2, 3.5 and 5 years. 
During  the  last  treatment  visit,  77%  of  patients  showed  a  relative  change  of 
between  -33%  and  +33%  compared 
to  baseline.  Only  24 patients  had  an 
increase > 33% in their last serum creatinine value while on treatment.

Risk factors and risk 
groups
Preventability
In Study CICL670A2301, fourteen (12%) patients had at least one serum creatinine 
value  > 33% above  Baseline and  the  age adjusted  ULN in at  least  two  consecutive 
measurements  at  least  seven  days  apart.  Increased  serum  creatinine  led  to  drug 
adjustment  or  interruption  in  five  (4.3%)  patients,  and  permanent  discontinuation  of 
study treatment in four patients. It is also known that factors like underlying disease, 
certain  concomitant  medications  (such  as  antibiotics),  and  underlying  medical 
conditions  (such  as  renal  failure)  may  result  in  compromised  renal  function, 
contributing to higher serum creatinine levels.
Eleven  (9.4%)  patients  (all  ≥ 18  years)  had  confirmed  CrCl < 60 mL/min  on 
2 consecutive  measurements  at  least  7 days  apart.  There  were  four  patients  in the 
overall  population  who  had  one  value  of  serum  CrCl  < 60 mL/min  during  the  study. 
None of the pediatric patient had a decrease of CrCl to < 60 mL/min. After an initial 
decrease, CrCl remained stable throughout the study. This is consistent with data from 
previous studies that have shown an early initial drop in CrCl, followed by stabilization.
In Study CICL670A2301, notably, two patients who had at least one serum creatinine 
with a > 33% change from Baseline and > ULN at 2 consecutives visits at least 7 days 
apart had renal failure: one patient had a history of chronic renal failure which was an 
active  condition  during  the  study,  and  the  other  had  one  AE  of  renal  failure  for  a 
duration of 59 days, which was mild in severity and not suspected to be study drug 
related.
Analyses showed that patients receiving high doses of deferasirox DT (20 or 30 mg/kg) 
and a low iron intake from infrequent blood transfusions were more likely to develop 
creatinine  increases.  Elderly  patients  were  more  likely  to  develop  creatinine 
values > ULN though, as explained above, the magnitude of increase in comparison to 
baseline was no higher in these patients.
Patients  with  pre-existing  renal  conditions  or  patients  who  are  receiving  medicinal 
products that depress renal function may be at higher risk of complications including 
ARF.
In  clinical  studies  a  relationship  between  iron  status  (liver  iron  and  ferritin 
concentrations), the rate of iron removal and renal effects has been observed. As with 
other iron chelator treatment, the risk of toxicity may be increased when inappropriately 
high doses of deferasirox are given in patients with a low iron burden or with serum 
ferritin levels that are only slightly elevated.
It  is  recommended  that  serum  creatinine  be  assessed  in  duplicate  before  initiating 
therapy, and monitored monthly thereafter.
In patients with pre-existing renal conditions or patients who are receiving medicinal 
products  that  depress  renal  function,  weekly  monitoring  of  serum  creatinine  is 
recommended  in  the  first  month  after  initiation  or  modification  of  therapy,  and  then 
monthly thereafter.
The  SmPC  advises  dose  reduction  in  patients  with  CrCl  levels  <90 mL/min  at  two 
consecutive  visits.  Deferasirox  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  renal  impairment 
(estimated CrCl < 60 mL/min).
The  SmPC  recommends  monthly  monitoring  for  proteinuria.  Additional  markers  of 
renal  tubular  function  (e.g.  glycosuria  in  non-diabetics  and  low  levels  of  serum 
potassium, phosphate, magnesium or urate, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria) may also be 
monitored. Dose reduction or interruption may be considered if there are abnormalities 
in levels of tubular markers and/or if clinically indicated.
If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/L, an interruption of treatment should 
be considered.
For NTDT, the SmPC states that chelation therapy should only be initiated when there 
is  evidence  of  iron  overload  (LIC  ≥ 5 mg  Fe/g  dry  weight  or  serum  ferritin 
consistently > 800 µg/L). In patients with no LIC assessment, caution should be taken

Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence
Characterization of the
risk:
Increased liver transaminases
Elevated liver transaminases have been correlated with increased LIC in patients with 
beta-thalassemia. Studies have shown that hepatomegaly is seen in 50% of patients 
with SCD, hepatitis in 11% of patients, and approximately one third of SCD patients 
will have a form of hepatic dysfunction (Edwards 2002).
Hepatic failure
In patients aged > 6 years with beta-thalassemia, 4-6% had evidence of liver failure or 
cirrhosis (Borgna-Pignatti et al 2004; Cunningham et al 2004).
Sickle  cell  disease  patients  can  develop  sickle  cell  crises  and  sequestration  events 
affecting the liver causing massive hepatic enlargement with hepatic failure occurring 
in up to 10% of patients. Cirrhosis has been reported in 16 to 29% of SCD patients 
(Edwards 2002).
Increased liver transaminases
Clinical trial data show a consistent correlation between improvements in LIC/serum 
ferritin and improvements in ALT/aspartate aminotransferase (AST).
Transaminase  increases  was  reported  as  an  AE  in  7.5%  of  patients  in  the  studies 
included  in  these  analyses.  There  was  a  decreasing  incidence  of  reports  with 
increasing age (13.4% in children aged 2-< 6 years and 0% in adults aged ≥ 65 years). 
Transaminase  increase  was  a  relatively  frequent  reason  for  discontinuation  of 
deferasirox but, the increases in transaminases in some of these patients may have 
been due to the administration of inappropriately low doses of deferasirox and reflects 
the associated increase in iron burden due to under-chelation.
Increases  in  liver  transaminase  levels  were  reported  as  an  AE  with  a  suspected 
relationship  to  study  drug in 2.3% of  patients  treated  with  deferasirox.  Elevations  of 
transaminases > 10 x ULN at ≥ 2 consecutive visits were infrequent (0.5%) though a 
single elevated value was seen in 5.8% of patients. Transaminase increases were not 
dose-dependent.  Most  of  these  patients  had  elevated  levels  prior  to  receiving 
deferasirox.  The  transaminase  increases  were  not  accompanied  by  increases  in 
bilirubin. There were no reports of hepatic failure or hepatic encephalopathy in these 
studies.  A  rapid  increase  in  transaminase  levels  that  recurred  on  re-challenge  with 
deferasirox  was  seen  in  one  patient  with  beta-thalassemia  in  whom  the  dose  of 
deferasirox DT was increased to 30 mg/kg despite a rapidly falling serum ferritin level. 
Liver  biopsy  was  compatible  with  drug-induced  liver  damage.  The  patient  did  not 
develop hepatic failure and made a full recovery following discontinuation of study drug. 
A second patient had progressive increases in transaminases during several months 
on therapy and the liver biopsy findings were compatible with, but not diagnostic of, 
drug-related hepatotoxicity. The transaminase values remained elevated several years 
after discontinuation of deferasirox.
In Study CICL670A2426, there was one report of ALT levels in the cohort (n=1, 0.8% 
of cohort), which occurred in an adult patient. There were no reports of ARF, glycosuria 
or  low  levels of serum  potassium, phosphate, magnesium or  urate,  phosphaturia or 
aminoaciduria. There were also no reports of hepatic failure, hepatitis or gall stones.
In Study CICL670AFR01T, the AST and ALT assays on inclusion in the study were 
higher than twice the upper limits of normal (> 80 IU/L) for 12% and 8% respectively of 
the  127 patients  analyzed  at  follow-up  at  5  years.  The  percentage  of  patients  with 
assays greater than twice the upper limits of normal never exceeded 17% for AST and 
10%  for  ALT  during  the  5-year  follow-up.  AST and  ALT  remained stable  (maximum 
change of +/- 40 IU/L) for over 80% of the patients throughout the 5-year follow-up.
In Study CICL670A2301, one of the primary endpoints was to evaluate the incidence 
and  clinical  management  of  ALT  increases  in  actual  practice  setting  (defined  as  a 
patient  having  ALT  above  5 × ULN  in  at  least  two  consecutive  post-Baseline

measurements  at  least  7 days  apart).  The  proportion  of  patients  which  met  that 
condition was 1 (0.9%).
One  (0.9%)  patient  had  a  post-Baseline  increase  in  ALT  above  5 x ULN  that  was 
confirmed  on  two consecutive  measurements  at  least  7 days  apart,  and  no patients 
had  post-Baseline  increases  in  ALT  above  10 x ULN  that  were  confirmed  on  two 
consecutive measurements at least 7 days apart. Two (1.7%) patients (both < 18 years 
old) had drug adjusted or temporarily interrupted due to elevated ALT and no patients 
discontinued due to increases in ALT.
Hepatic failure
In toxicology studies with deferasirox, no hepatocellular findings were reported in any 
species.
In the studies included in this analysis, the overall frequency of patients with at least 
one of the AE terms included in the SMQ ‘Hepatic failure, cirrhosis and fibrosis’ was 
1.0%.  Hepatic  failure  was  reported  as  such  in  2 patients.  None  of  these cases  was 
assessed as related to deferasirox by the Investigator.
This potential risk has been added to the RMP based mainly on post-marketing reports. 
Many  of  the  patients  with  liver  failure  had  severe  underlying  liver  disease,  most 
probably related to severe iron overload, when therapy with deferasirox was initiated, 
with severe cirrhosis and hepatitis C as the common abnormalities. Most of the patients 
were  critically  ill  with  major  life-threatening  complications  (e.g.  sepsis,  multi-organ 
failure) related to their underlying disease. Of note, hepatic failure related to severe 
liver  iron  overload  is  among  the  leading  causes  of  death  in  patients  with 
transfusion-dependent hemosiderosis.
It is not possible to determine whether the subsequent deterioration in liver function in 
these patients was coincidental, was related to a concomitant medication, or whether 
deferasirox in some way contributed to liver decompensation.
In patients receiving deferasirox DT doses > 30 mg/kg, an increased incidence of this 
AE was not observed.
Of  note,  clinical  trial  data  show  a  consistent  correlation  between  improvements  in 
LIC/serum ferritin and improvements in ALT/AST.
Increased liver transaminases
None identified.
Hepatic failure
Patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment.
Increased liver transaminases
The  SmPC  advises  cautious  treatment  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  It 
recommends monitoring of serum transaminases at baseline, after 2 weeks of therapy 
and monthly thereafter.
Hepatic failure
Apart  from  the  above  mentioned  step  of  prevention  in  the  SmPC,  interruption  of 
treatment in case of persistent and progressive increase in serum transaminase levels 
that cannot be attributed to other causes is recommended. Once the cause of the liver 
function test abnormalities has been clarified or after return to normal levels, cautious 
re-initiation of treatment at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation may be 
considered.

balance of the product
From the experience with DFO, high frequency hearing impairment appears to be the 
main  finding  related  to  chelation  therapy  and  this  was  confirmed  in  only  a  minority 
of patients  with  hearing  loss  during  therapy  both  with  deferasirox  and  DFO.  A  low 
serum ferritin has also been reported to predispose to deafness in patients treated with 
DFO.  However,  there  was  no  clear  relationship  to  serum  ferritin  levels  in  patients 
reporting deafness as an AE whether treated with deferasirox or DFO. The relationship 
of these audiometry findings to deferasirox is currently uncertain.
Hearing loss not attributed to chelation therapy has been reported in 28% of patients 
with  beta-thalassemia  (Chiodo  et al 1997).  A  study  of  75  adults  with  SCD 
demonstrated that the prevalence of hearing loss was 41% and was higher than that 
of the general population (Crawford et al 1991).
Adverse  events  relating  to  hearing loss  were  reported irrespective  of  relationship  to 
deferasirox in 3.4% of patients but in only 1% of patients with a suspected relationship 
to study drug. The percentage of patients with AEs related to deafness increased with 
age (from 1.0% in children aged 2-< 6 years to 6.5% in adults aged ≥ 65 years). Only 
2 patients  discontinued  deferasirox  due  to  hearing  loss.  Of  the  353 patients  treated 
with  deferoxamine  in  Study CICL670A0107  and  Study CICL670A0109,  10 patients 
developed hearing loss which was assessed as drug-related in five cases.
From the experience with DFO, high frequency hearing impairment appears to be the 
main  finding  related  to  chelation  therapy  and  this  was  confirmed  in  only  a  minority 
of patients  with  hearing  loss  during  therapy  both  with  deferasirox  and  DFO.  A  low 
serum ferritin has also been reported to predispose to deafness in patients treated with 
DFO.  However,  there  was  no  clear  relationship  to  serum  ferritin  levels  in  patients 
reporting deafness as an AE whether treated with deferasirox or DFO. The relationship 
of these audiometry findings to deferasirox is currently uncertain.
In patients receiving deferasirox DT doses >30 mg/kg, an increased incidence of this 
AE was not observed.
In  Study  CICL670A2411,  15  (5.7%)  patients  in  total  experienced  at  least  1 AE 
belonging to the ear and labyrinth disorders SOC. The most commonly reported PT 
was  conductive deafness  (8 patients;  3.1%) followed  by ear  pain  (3 patients,  1.1%). 
These were transitory in nature and usually associated with upper respiratory or middle 
ear infections. There were 21 (8.0%) patients with evidence of hearing impairment in 
at  least  one  ear.  None  of  these  events  were  assessed  as  having  a  suspected 
relationship  to  drug  by  the  Investigator.  Auditory  evaluations  did  not  reveal  the 
appearance of new clinically relevant abnormalities during deferasirox treatment in this 
study.
As  with  other  iron  chelator  treatment,  the  risk  of  toxicity  may  be  increased  when 
inappropriately high doses are given in patients with a low iron burden or with serum 
ferritin levels that are only slightly elevated.
Auditory  testing  is  recommended  before  the  start  of  deferasirox treatment  and  at 
regular  intervals  thereafter  (every  12 months).  If  disturbances  are  noted,  dose 
reduction or interruption may be considered.
Auditory testing before and at regular intervals during treatment.
The impact of hearing impairment on the quality of life is considered to be significant. 
It  is  preventable  by  monitoring  for  signs  of  symptoms  of  hearing  loss  and  initiating 
treatment promptly.

risk:
Risk factors and risk 
groups
The  background  incidence  of  eye  abnormalities  in  patients with  beta-thalassemia  is 
poorly  documented.  However,  several  reports  document  patients  with  lenticular 
opacities who have never received chelation therapy though the overall incidence was 
not  provided  (Bloomfield  et  al 1978,  Gartaganis  et  al 1989,  Rinaldi  et  al 1993). 
Cataracts have not been reported in patients with SCD. In the predominantly elderly 
patients with MDS, senile cataracts are a relatively frequent event.
the  353 patients 
Cataracts/lenticular opacities were observed in non-clinical studies with deferasirox.
Adverse events relating to eye abnormalities were reported irrespective of relationship 
to deferasirox in 1.2% of patients and in 0.5% of patients with a suspected relationship 
to  study  drug.  The  incidence  of  cataracts/lenticular  opacities  was  relatively  high  in 
patients  aged  ≥ 65  years  (at  6.5%)  but  this  was  based  on  low  numbers  of  patients 
treated with deferasirox. None of these events was assessed as related to study drug, 
suggesting that the investigators believed these to be ‘senile’ cataracts. Three patients 
with thalassemia discontinued deferasirox due to cataracts/lenticular opacities.
Of 
in  Study CICL670A0107  and 
treated  with  DFO 
Study CICL670A0109,  five  developed  lens  opacities,  which  were  assessed  to  be 
drug-related in four cases. A low serum ferritin has been reported to predispose to eye 
abnormalities  in  patients  treated  with  DFO.  Although  three  patients  discontinued 
deferasirox  due  to  ocular  findings,  none  had  low  serum  ferritins  and  therefore  an 
excessive removal of iron appears to be an unlikely explanation for the findings in these 
individuals.  The  relationship  of  the  eye  abnormalities  to  deferasirox  is  currently 
uncertain.
In patients receiving deferasirox DT doses > 30 mg/kg, an increased incidence of this 
AE was not observed.
In  Study  CICL670A2411,  12/261  (4.6%)  patients  in  total  reported  events  in  the  eye 
disorder system organ class (SOC) during the study. An abnormal ophthalmological 
examination was reported in two patients (hyperopic astigmatism in one patient and 
subcapsular cataract in another patient). Study drug was not adjusted or interrupted. 
The  patients  completed  the  study  and  were  continuing  deferasirox  when  the  study 
closed. There was one more patient in addition for which blurred vision was reported 
repeatedly  although  no  abnormal  ophthalmological  assessment  was  available.  No 
severe potentially irreversible disorders of the retina were reported during this study. 
In summary, repeated visual evaluations did not reveal the appearance of new clinically 
relevant abnormalities during deferasirox treatment in this study.
As  with  other  iron  chelator  treatments,  the  risk  of  toxicity  may  be  increased  when 
inappropriately high doses are given in patients with a low iron burden or with serum 
ferritin levels that are only slightly elevated.

hepatic  function,  urine protein,  ocular and hearing screening  at  baseline  and  during 
treatment)  requirements  in  the  SmPC  is  an  important  routine  risk  minimization 
measure.
Study CICL670A2425
A total of 209 eligible respondents completed the Physician survey in 2015. The results 
suggest that the respondents had a modest understanding of the appropriate dosing 
and  biological  monitoring  (serum  ferritin,  renal  and  hepatic  laboratory  parameters). 
Overall, dissemination of information about the appropriate use of deferasirox has been 
moderately  effective  in  making  prescribers  aware  of  the  appropriate  dosing  and 
biological  monitoring  requirements 
Italy  and  Spain  generally 
demonstrated a higher level of understanding with a high proportion (above 90%) of 
prescribers  in  these  two  countries  reporting  having  received  information  from  MAH 
sales representatives and a low proportion from the mailing of education materials (less 
than 6%).
Seriousness and outcome of noncompliance depend on the degree of noncompliance.
Physician survey (Survey NO6987)
This  physician  survey  aimed  to  assess  the  impact  of  educational  materials  and  the 
existing  label  on  the  physicians’  awareness  of  doses  and  biological  monitoring 
recommendations and the awareness and appropriate use of both Exjade DT and FCT 
formulations.
A  total  of  375 eligible  respondents  completed  the  survey  in  2018.  For  posology 
questions common to both the 2015 and 2018 surveys, the 2015 respondents had an 
overall higher correct response rate for administration and dosing questions (62.2%) 
versus the 2018 respondents (55.9%). For biological monitoring questions common to 
both the 2015 and 2018 surveys, the total correct response rates were similar (73% in

both  surveys),  indicating  a  continuity  in  the  physician’s  knowledge  of  the  complex 
biological monitoring, and which remains so after several years on the market.
Overall, there was generally a high level of awareness for deferasirox in: mode of FCT 
dosing administration; starting dose difference when switching from DT to FCT; initial 
daily dose of FCTs and DTs following transfusion or with transfusional iron overload; 
dose  escalation;  proper  clinical  parameters  assessed  before  starting  therapy; 
monitoring of serum creatinine; monitoring of serum ferritin; recommendations in case 
of persistent and progressive increase in serum transaminase levels; and the risk of 
complications for patients with pre-existing renal conditions.
An  overview  of  effectiveness of  this  Physician survey  also  indicated  that  physicians 
have  acquired  relevant  knowledge  around  switching  between  the  different  dosing 
forms.  Taken  into  consideration  the  increased  complexity  during  the  2018  survey, 
(2 pharmaceutical forms [DT and FCT] were in the market during the 2018 survey and 
only  1 [DT]  during  the  2015  survey),  the  overall  results  of  the  2018 are  on  par  with 
those of the 2015 survey (65.05% vs 67.89%).

Study  CICL670E2422  - An  observational,  multi-center  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  of 
deferasirox  in  the  treatment  of  pediatric  patients  with  non-transfusion-dependent  iron 
overload
Study short name and title:
An observational, multi-center study to evaluate the safety of deferasirox in the treatment of 
pediatric patients with non-transfusion-dependent iron overload.
Rationale and study objectives:
The  purpose  of  this  observational  study  is  to  provide  further  assessment  of  the  safety  of 
deferasirox  in NTDT  pediatric patients with documented iron overload as  defined in a local 
product label. The primary objective is to characterize the long term safety profile of deferasirox 
in pediatric patients with NTDT with exposure up to 5 years.
Study design:
This  study  is  a  registry  of  pediatric  patients  with  non-transfusion  dependent  thalassemia 
conducted in response to a post-approval commitment to the United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for an observational study in this population in order to assess long-term 
exposure and safety of deferasirox. (PMR 1994-4: “Establish a registry of children [aged 10 to 
< 18 years  old  at  enrollment]  with  NTDT  and  treated  with  deferasirox  for  documented  iron 
overload. Study CICL670E2422 will follow at least 40 children for up to 5 years to assess and 
analyze the long-term safety of treatment with deferasirox, including an assessment of growth, 
compared  to  children  on  a  regular  transfusion  program  receiving  deferasirox  [based  on

Part V.2. Additional Risk minimization measures
Educational material:
Objectives:
Aimed to inform healthcare professionals and patients to minimise the risks related to:
 Compliance of the posology and biological monitoring
 Medication errors due to switching between Exjade FCT/granules and generic versions of
deferasirox DT
Rationale for the additional risk minimization activity:
 To educate prescribers and patients about the appropriate dosing (including dose adjustment
requirements  in  case  of  switch  between  Exjade  FCT/granules  and  generic  versions  of
deferasirox DT) and biological monitoring.
 To provide a prescribing decision tool for physicians to support calculation of appropriate
posology and tracking of biological monitoring (physicians’ checklist).
Target audience and planned distribution path:
Prescribers and patients.
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success:
The effectiveness of risk minimization measures for the safety concern will be measured on the 
basis of ongoing routine PhV activities and assessment of new data in PSURs.
Additionally, a physician survey (CICL670A2429) is currently being conducted to assess the 
impact  of  educational  materials  on  the  prescribers’  knowledge  of  posology  and  biological 
monitoring recommendations for Exjade. This non-interventional PASS and risk minimization 
assessment  will  be  conducted  among  Exjade  physicians  in  10 countries and  the  primary 
outcome  of  the  survey  is  the  observed  mean  correct  response  rate  (in  percentage)  for  each 
survey section for posology and biological monitoring.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan for deferasirox 
(ICL670)
This is a summary of the RMP for deferasirox. The RMP details important risks of deferasirox,
how  these  risks  can  be  minimized,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
deferasirox’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Deferasirox’s SmPC  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential  information  to  healthcare 
professionals and patients on how deferasirox should be used.
This summary of the RMP for deferasirox should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of  the 
deferasirox’s RMP.
13.1
Part VI: I. The medicine and what it is used for
Deferasirox is N-substituted bis-hydroxyphenyl-triazole. It is a tridentate ligand that binds ferric 
iron  with  high  affinity  in  a  2:1  ratio  and  promotes  excretion  of  iron,  primarily  in  the  feces.
Deferasirox is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions 
(transfusional hemosiderosis) in patients with thalassemia, SCD, MDS or other rare anemias, 
and for the treatment of chronic iron overload in patients with NTDT syndromes.
For transfusional iron overload, recommended initial daily dose for FCT/granules is 14 mg/kg 
body weight (initial doses of 7 mg/kg or 21 mg/kg may be considered depending on transfusion 
intensity and treatment goal). Dose adjustments in steps of 3.5-7 mg/kg/day may be considered 
every 3-6 months. Doses above 28 mg/kg are not recommended because there is only limited 
experience with doses above this level.
For  patients  with  NTDT  syndromes,  recommended initial  daily  dose  for  FCT/granules  is 
7 mg/kg body weight. Dose adjustments in steps of 3.5-7 mg/kg/day may be considered every 
36 months. Doses above 14 mg/kg are not recommended because there is no experience with 
doses  above  this  level  . In  patients  in  whom  LIC  was  not  assessed  and  serum  ferritin  is 
≤ 2000 µg/L, as well as in pediatric patients, dosing should not exceed 7 mg/kg. For patients in 
whom the dose was increased to > 7 mg/kg, dose reduction to 7 mg/kg or less is recommended 
when LIC is < 7 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin is ≤ 2000 µg/L.
Exjade Dispersible Tablet (DT) has been discontinued in the EU markets and is therefore no 
longer available for patients. However, generic versions of deferasirox DT may be available.
In case of switching patients between Exjade FCT/granules and generic versions of deferasirox 
DT, the dose of the Exjade FCT/granules should be adjusted. As a reference, the corresponding 
doses for Exjade FCT/granules and Exjade DT are shown in the tables below.

13.2
Part VI: II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks
Important risks of deferasirox, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about deferasirox’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;

 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of deferasirox, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, in Table 13-7 and Table 13-8, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine PhV activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of deferasirox is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ in Table 13-9 and Table 13-10, below.

 Medication errors due to switching between Exjade FCT/granules and generic versions of
deferasirox DT
The  risk  of  medication  error  is  due  to  switching  between  Exjade  FCT/granules  and  generic 
deferasirox  DT  formulations  available  on  the  market  by  different  MAHs  and  as  appropriate 
depending on the coexistence of these formulations at a national level. The MAH shall ensure 
that,  in  each  Member  State  where  EXJADE  is  marketed,  all  healthcare  professionals  and 
patients  who  are  expected  to  prescribe,  dispense  and  use  EXJADE  are  provided  with  the 
following educational package for all available formulations (EXJADE film-coated tablets and 
EXJADE granules) for all indications: 
 Physician education material and
 Patient information pack
Additional  periodic  distributions  should  be  performed,  notably  after  substantial  safety 
modifications of the product information justifying educational material updates. 
The MAH shall use distinct outer cartons, blisters and tablets for all formulation (film-coated 
tablets and granules).
Objective
The objectives and goals of the educational materials are to provide further detailed information 
to  prescribers  of  deferasirox  and  their  patients  to  minimize  the  potential  safety  risk  of 
compliance with posology and biological monitoring and medication errors due to switching 
between  Exjade  FCT/granules  and  generic  versions  of  deferasirox  DT,  and  to  ensure  more 
effective dissemination of the information of the key safety elements.
Furthermore, the educational material aims to provide a prescribing decision tool for physicians 
to support calculation of appropriate posology and tracking of biological monitoring, through 
the provision of a physicians’ checklist.
Details of proposed educational program
The physician educational material should contain elements:
 The Summary of Product Characteristics
 Guide for healthcare professionals (which also includes a physicians’ checklist)
Novartis
EU Safety Risk Management Plan version 21.2
Page 102 of 118
ICL670/deferasirox
The Guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements as appropriate 
depending on the coexistence of deferasirox formulations at a national level:
 Description of available deferasirox formulation (EXJADE film-coated tablets and granules)
in the EU markets
 Different posology regimen
 Different conditions of administration
 Dose  conversion  table  of  Exjade  FCT/granules  and  Exjade  DT  as  a  reference  when
switching between Exjade FCT/granules and generic versions of deferasirox DT
 The recommended doses and the rules for starting treatment
 The need to monitor serum ferritin monthly
 That deferasirox causes rises in serum creatinine in some patients
 The need to monitor serum creatinine
a. On two occasions prior to initiation of treatment
b. Every  week  during  the  first  month  of  initiation  of  treatment  or  after  therapy
modification
c. Monthly thereafter
 The need to reduce by 7 mg/kg the dose if serum creatinine rises:
a. Adults:  >33%  above  baseline  and  creatinine  clearance  <Lower  limit  of  normal
(LLN) (90 ml/min)
b. Pediatrics: either >ULN or creatinine clearance falls to <LLN at two consecutive
visits.
 The need to interrupt treatment after a dose reduction if serum creatinine rises:
a. Adults and Pediatrics: remain >33% above baseline or creatinine clearance <LLN
(90 ml/min)
 The need to consider renal biopsy:
a. When serum creatinine is elevated and if another abnormality has been detected
(e.g. proteinuria, signs of Fanconi’s Syndrome).
 The importance of measuring creatinine clearance
 Brief overview of methods of measuring creatinine clearance
 That rises in serum transaminases may occur in patients treated with deferasirox
 The need for liver function tests prior to prescription, then at monthly intervals or more
often if clinically indicated
 Not to prescribe to patients with pre-existing severe hepatic disease
 The need to interrupt treatment if persistent and progressive increase in liver enzyme
were noted.
 The need for annual auditory and ophthalmic testing
 The need for a guidance table highlighting pre-treatment measurements of serum creatinine,
creatinine clearance, proteinuria, hepatic enzymes, ferritin, such as:
Novartis
EU Safety Risk Management Plan version 21.2

ICL670/deferasirox
Before initiating treatment
Serum creatinine at Day – X
Serum creatinine at Day – Y
X and  Y are the  days (to be determined) when  pre-treatment measurements  should  be 
performed.
Value 1
Value 2
 A warning on the risk of overchelation and on the necessity of close monitoring of serum
ferritin levels and renal and hepatic function.
 The  rules  for  treatment  dose  adjustments  and  interruption  when  target  serum  ferritin  +/-
liver iron concentration are reached.
 Recommendations  for  treatment  of non-transfusion-dependent  thalassaemia  (NTDT)
syndromes:

 A warning on the necessity of closer monitoring of liver iron concentration and serum
Information that only one course of treatment is proposed for NTDT patients
ferritin in the pediatric population
 A warning on the currently unknown safety consequences of long-term treatment in the
pediatric population
The patient information pack should contain:
 Package leaflet
 Patient guide
Patient guide should contain the following key elements:

Information on the need for regular monitoring, and when it should be carried out, of
serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, hepatic enzymes, ferritin
Information that renal biopsy may be considered if significant renal abnormalities occur

 Availability of several oral formulation (i.e., generic version of deferasirox dispersible
tablets, film-coated tablets and granules) and the main differences associated with these
formulations (i.e., different posology  regimen, different  conditions of  administration
notably with food)

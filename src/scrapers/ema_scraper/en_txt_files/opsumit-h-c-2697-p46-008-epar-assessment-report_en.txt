1.  Introduction 
On 9 July 2018, the MAH submitted the final study report for the clinical study AC-055-308 (MAESTRO OL) for 
macitentan, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that AC-055-308 (MAESTRO OL) is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The study was conducted in Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) subjects with macitentan 10 mg film-coated tablets. 
No  pediatric  formulation  was  used,  as  all  subjects  in  this  study  received  the  commercially  available  adult 
formulation. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Macitentan is an orally active potent endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), active on both endothelin (ET) ETA 
and ETB receptors and approximately 100-fold more selective for ETA as compared to ETB in vitro. Pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) is associated with an activation of the ET system. Macitentan displays high affinity 
and sustained occupancy of the ET receptors in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. This prevents 
the ET-mediated activation of second messenger systems that result in vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell 
proliferation. 
Macitentan  was  approved  under  the  brand  name  Opsumit®  for  the  treatment  of  PAH  in  adult  subjects  in 
December  2013,  based  on  data  generated  in  a  long-term  Phase  3  study  (AC-055-302/SERAPHIN)  with  a 
morbidity/mortality primary endpoint [Pulido 2013]. 
In the EU, macitentan is approved in the following indication:  
Opsumit, as monotherapy or in combination, is indicated for the long-term treatment of PAH in adult patients of 
WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III. 
Efficacy  has  been  shown  in  a  PAH  population  including  idiopathic  and  heritable  PAH,  PAH  associated  with 
connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital heart disease (see section 
5.1). 
Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) is part of the WHO Group 1 of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and is a progressive, 
multi-organ disorder with high morbidity and mortality that represents the most advanced form and end-stage 
of congenital heart disease (CHD)-associated PAH. In general, ES is characterized by the complete or partial 
reversal of an initial long-standing systemic-to-pulmonary cardiac shunt that induces an increase in pulmonary 
vascular resistance and eventually progresses into a cyanotic pulmonary-to-systemic shunt [Beghetti 2009]. As 
such, although the cardiac defect is present at birth, ES usually presents later in life, either before puberty or in

early adulthood, as the existing alterations of the normal physiology of the heart lead to maladaptive responses 
that  develop  over  time.  The  risk  for  developing  ES  appears  to  be  determined  by  the  size  of  the  initial 
systemic-to-pulmonary shunt and the volume of pulmonary blood flow, as well as the type of cardiac defect. ES 
is  a  heterogeneous  disease,  resulting  from  a  range  of  congenital  heart  defects  characterized  by  elevated 
pulmonary arterial pressure and right-to-left shunting with cyanosis [Gatzoulis 2014].  
Subjects  with  ES  were  excluded  from  the  SERAPHIN  study  in  PAH,  which  only  allowed  simple  congenital 
systemic-to-pulmonary shunts at least 1 year post-surgical repair. In order to demonstrate that macitentan 
improves exercise capacity in an ES population, a dedicated Phase 3 study, AC-055-305/MAESTRO [D-16.551], 
was conducted in subjects with ES. 
CHD  accounts  for  nearly  one  third  of  all  major  congenital  anomalies  and  is  the  most  common  congenital 
condition  diagnosed  in  newborns  [Hoffman  2002,  Reller  2008].  As  the  underlying  congenital  heart  lesion(s) 
drive the progression of ES, the study was open to subjects aged 12 years of age and older to allow for the 
inclusion of these subjects when ES physiology first manifests, or early in the course of their disease. Patients 
with Down Syndrome (DS) represent an important subset of the ES population. These subjects tend to have a 
higher incidence of complex cardiac defects that are most commonly associated with PAH, and in particular, ES. 
Despite  this,  there  is  a  lack  of  clinical  trials  in  subjects  with  both  ES  and  DS,  with  significant  therapeutic 
implications in the management of these subjects as a consequence. In an effort to address the high unmet need 
in this population, the MAESTRO study was the first randomized clinical trial in ES to include subjects with DS. 
Following  participation  in  the  MAESTRO  study,  subjects  were  invited  to  enroll  in  the  open-label  (OL), 
non-comparative, multicenter, long-term, extension study AC-055-308/MAESTRO OL. MAESTRO OL was aimed 
at assessing the long-term safety and tolerability of macitentan in subjects with ES, including ES patients with 
DS, beyond the treatment period of the MAESTRO study, and the long-term effect of macitentan on exercise 
capacity  in  this  patient  population.  14  adolescents  (aged  12–17  years)  were  enrolled  into the  MAESTRO  OL 
study. The study data are therefore being submitted for review to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 (the ‘Paediatric Regulation’). 
The MAESTRO OL study was not part of the macitentan Paediatric Investigation Plan agreed upon for the PAH 
indication. 
The purpose of this addendum is to provide a summary of the data from the MAESTRO OL study with emphasis 
on the pediatric sub-set, focusing on long-term safety and effect on exercise capacity. A previous addendum was 
written to summarize the data from pediatric subjects in the MAESTRO study only [D-17.321] and submitted to 
EMA under the Article 46 procedure (EMEA/H/C/002697/P46/0006).  
The  MAESTRO  OL  study  was  prematurely  terminated  after  the  MAESTRO  study  did  not  demonstrate  a 
statistically significant effect of macitentan on the primary efficacy endpoint of exercise capacity as measured by 
6-minute walk distance (6MWD). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study AC-055-308/MAESTRO OL 
Description 
Long-term, single-arm, open-label extension study of protocol AC-055-305 to assess the safety, tolerability and 
efficacy of macitentan in subjects with Eisenmenger Syndrome.

Methods 
Objectives 
The AC-055-308 / MAESTRO open-label (OL) study  aimed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of 
macitentan in subjects with ES beyond the treatment of the AC-055-305 / MAESTRO double-blind (DB) study, 
and to assess the long-term effect of macitentan on exercise capacity in this subject population. 
Study design 
AC-055-308/MAESTRO  OL  was  a  multi-center,  OL,  non-comparative,  Phase  3  extension  study  following  the 
AC-055-305/MAESTRO study to assess the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of macitentan in subjects 
with ES [D-16.551]. The study was conducted in 51 centers in 19 countries. It was planned to enroll up to 220 
subjects  (males  or  females)  from  the  MAESTRO  study.  Subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  OL  study  without 
knowledge of their previous study treatment (macitentan or placebo). 
A total of 217 subjects were enrolled into the OL study. The enrollment visit in the MAESTRO OL study (OL Visit 
1) was combined with the end-of-treatment (EOT) or premature EOT visit of the MAESTRO study.  
The MAESTRO OL study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines.  
The main features of the MAESTRO OL study are summarized in Table 1, below. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study enrolled 14 pediatric subjects aged 12–17 years who had completed the MAESTRO study. 1 additional 
pediatric subject in the MAESTRO study had his 18th birthday during the MAESTRO study, enrolled in the 
MAESTRO OL study as an adult, and therefore is not included in the MAESTRO OL pediatric analysis presented 
here. 1 pediatric patient had DS. All 14 pediatric subjects completed the MAESTRO OL study [Table 2].

Treatments 
Subjects were enrolled into the OL study without knowledge of their previous study treatment (macitentan or 
placebo). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
EFFICACY: 
Efficacy was assessed on an exploratory basis in this study. The endpoints were defined as: 
• Change from DB baseline* to Week 16 in the DB study, Month 6, and Month 12 in the OL study, in: 
– Exercise capacity, as measured by the 6MWD; 
– WHO FC; 
– Dyspnea (assessed by the Borg dyspnea index); 
– Oxygen saturation, assessed by pulse oximetry: peripheral oxygen saturation 
(SpO2) at rest before the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). 
*DB baseline is defined as the last value assessed prior to the DB treatment start date. 
SAFETY:

For the evaluation of treatment-emergent safety endpoints, the observation period for each individual subject 
started at the time of the first administration of macitentan and ended with the permanent discontinuation of 
macitentan + 30 days, regardless of study (i.e., DB or OL). 
The safety variables assessed were: 
• Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation; 
• AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study treatment; 
• Deaths up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation; 
• Treatment-emergent serious AEs (SAEs) up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation; 
• Treatment-emergent AEs of special interest (AESIs: anemia, hypotension, edema/fluid overload) up to 30 
days after study treatment discontinuation; 
• Treatment-emergent marked laboratory abnormalities up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation; 
• Change from baseline** up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation in laboratory variables; 
• Treatment-emergent alkaline aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) abnormality 
(> 3 × upper limit of normal [ULN]; > 5 × ULN; > 8 × ULN) associated or not with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN up 
to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation; 
•  Change  from  baseline**  up  to  30  days  after  study  treatment  discontinuation  in  vital  signs  (arterial  blood 
pressure [BP], pulse rate) and body weight. 
** Baseline is defined as the last value assessed prior to the macitentan treatment start date. 
Statistical Methods 
No statistical hypothesis was considered for this OL extension study. Two analysis sets were defined: 
The All-enrolled analysis set (ENR) included all subjects enrolled in AC-055-308 / MAESTRO-OL, whether or not 
they took at least one dose of macitentan during the OL study. 
The All-treated DB + OL set (TTS) comprised: 
• All subjects who received at least one dose of macitentan in AC-055-308 / MAESTRO-OL 
AND 
• All subjects who received macitentan during the AC-055-305 / MAESTRO-DB and were not enrolled in the OL 
study. 
No primary efficacy variables were described in this study. All efficacy analyses were considered exploratory and 
were performed on the ENR, and were evaluated over the Combined DB + OL period, using the DB baseline. 
The safety data were analyzed descriptively for the Combined DB + OL period, using the TTS.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The study enrolled 14 pediatric subjects aged 12–17 years who had completed the MAESTRO study. 1 additional 
pediatric  subject  in  the  MAESTRO  study  had  his  18th  birthday  during  the  MAESTRO  study,  enrolled  in  the 
MAESTRO OL study as an adult, and therefore is not included in the MAESTRO OL pediatric analysis presented 
here. 1 pediatric patient had DS. All 14 pediatric subjects completed the MAESTRO OL study [Table 2]. 
Efficacy results 
All efficacy endpoints in MAESTRO OL were exploratory. The main exploratory efficacy endpoint was change 
from baseline in exercise capacity as measured by 6MWD, where baseline was defined as the last value assessed 
prior to randomization into the MAESTRO study. 
The change from MAESTRO baseline in exercise capacity, as measured by 6MWD, was assessed at Week 16 
(EOT of the MAESTRO study), and Month 6 and Month 12 of the MAESTRO OL study. 
In the overall MAESTRO OL population, for subjects who were randomized to macitentan in the MAESTRO study, 
and who continued to receive macitentan in the MAESTRO OL study, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) change 
from baseline was 24.4 (71.0) m at Week 16, 26.2 (77.9) m at Month 6 and 26.5 (79.8) m at Month 12. For 
subjects who were randomized to placebo in the MAESTRO study and who received macitentan in the MAESTRO 
OL study, the mean (SD) change from baseline was 18.2 (53.0) m at Week 16, 43.4 (51.5) m at Month 6 and 
39.9 (55.1) m at Month 12 [D-18.003, section 11.2.1]. 
In  the  pediatric  sub-set,  for  subjects  who  were  randomized  to  macitentan  in  the  MAESTRO  study,  and  who 
continued  to  receive  macitentan  in  the  MAESTRO  OL  study,  the  mean  (SD)  change  from  baseline  was  14.8

(28.3)  m  at  Week  16,  20.3  (77.0)  m  at  Month  6,  and  15.1  (61.8)  m  at  Month  12.  For  subjects  who  were 
randomized to placebo in the MAESTRO study and who received macitentan in the MAESTRO OL study, the mean 
(SD) change from baseline was 46.0 (35.4) m at Week 16, 36.0 (42.4) m at Month 6, and 89.0 (2.8) m at Month 
12 [Table 7 and  Figure 1].

Assessor’s comments 
Results show that efficacy in the pediatric sub-set is similar to the one observed in the overall MAESTRO 
population.  
However, it should be noted that the reduced sample size (12 subjects in the macitentan arm and 2 subjects in 
the placebo arm) makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions with this regard. 
Safety results 
Safety  was  evaluated  for  the  entire  duration  of  macitentan  exposure  in  MAESTRO  and  MAESTRO  OL.  The 
observation  period  for  each  individual  subject  started  at  the  time  of  the  first  administration  of  macitentan, 
regardless of whether this occurred in the MAESTRO or MAESTRO OL study, and ended with the permanent 
discontinuation of macitentan + 30 days. Baseline values were defined as the last value assessed before the first 
exposure to macitentan, regardless of whether the first dose of macitentan was in the MAESTRO or MAESTRO OL 
study. 
Safety analyses for the overall MAESTRO OL population are shown for context. However, caution should be used 
when comparing percentages of pediatric subjects to those of the MAESTRO OL population overall, due to the 
low number of pediatric subjects enrolled. 
Exposure to study treatments in the pediatric population 
The median duration of exposure to study treatment (including interruptions) in the pediatric sub-set (combined 
DB+OL) was 167.71 weeks [Table 8]. 
The median duration of exposure to study treatment (including interruptions) in the pediatric sub-set (OL) was 
151.21 weeks [Table 9]. 
For  context,  the  median  duration  of  exposure  to  study  treatment  in  the  overall  MAESTRO  OL  population 
(including interruptions) was approximately 131.93 weeks [D-18.003, section 12.1.1.1].

Adverse events in the pediatric population 
The proportion of subjects aged 12–17 years with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) was 92.9% 
(n = 13) [Table 10]. These rates are comparable to those in the overall MAESTRO OL population (91.0%, n = 
202 [D-18.003, table 12-3]). No AEs of severe intensity were reported for pediatric subjects [Table 10]. For 
context,  AEs  of  severe  intensity  were  reported  for  23.9%  (n  =  53)  of  subjects  in  the  overall  MAESTRO  OL 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

population [D-18.003, section 12.2.2]. AEs that were considered by the investigator to be drug-related were 
reported  for  50%  (n  =  7)  of  pediatric  subjects  [Table  10].  For  context,  drug-related  AEs  were  reported  for 
35.1% of the overall MAESTRO OL population [D-18.003, table 12-3]. 
Hemoglobin decreased and upper respiratory tract infection were the most frequently reported AEs, each with a 
frequency  of  28.6%  (n  =  4)  [Table  11].  Other  AE  terms  reported  for  >  1  pediatric  subject  were  alanine 
aminotransferase increased (n = 3), cough (n = 3), viral upper respiratory tract infection (n = 3), respiratory 
tract infection viral (n = 2), abdominal pain (n = 2), bronchitis (n = 2), headache (n = 2), rhinitis allergic (n = 
2), dizziness (n = 2), and sinus arrhythmia (n = 2). All other AE terms reported were reported for only 1 subject. 
The pattern of AEs observed in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in the overall MAESTRO OL 
population.

Deaths 
There were no deaths in pediatric subjects. 
Serious adverse events 
2 pediatric subjects (14.3%) experienced a total of 3 serious AEs (SAEs), all of which occurred during the OL 
study [Table 14]. 1 subject experienced an event of hypoxia that was considered to be of moderate intensity and 
not related to the study drug.  
The  other  subject  experienced  events  of  viral  pharyngitis  and  anxiety.  The  event  of  viral  pharyngitis  was 
reported to be of moderate intensity and the event of anxiety of mild intensity. Neither event was considered by 
the investigator to be related to the study drug. Detailed narratives of the events are provided in the MAESTRO 
OL clinical study report (CSR) [D-18.003, section 15.4.2].  
For context, 67 (30.2%) of subjects in the overall MAESTRO OL population experienced at least 1 SAE during the 
combined MAESTRO / MAESTRO OL studies [D-18.003, section 12.3.2]. 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment 
2 pediatric subjects (14.3%) prematurely discontinued study treatment due to an AE [Table 15].

1 subject discontinued due to pregnancy. She underwent induced abortion. The other subject discontinued due 
to hemoglobin decrease. The event was assessed as non-serious and related to study drug by the investigator 
[Section  5.3.1]  Detailed  narratives  of  the  events  are  provided  in  the  MAESTRO  OL  CSR  [D-18.003,  section 
15.4.3]. 
For  context,  27  (12.2%)  of  subjects  in  the  overall  MAESTRO  OL  population  prematurely  discontinued  study 
treatment due to an AE [D-18.003, section 12.3.3]. 
Safety topics of special interest 
AEs of special interest were defined as ‘Anaemia’, ‘Hypotension’, and ‘Oedema and fluid overload’ [Standardized 
MedDRA Query defined in D-18.003, section 9.8.2.2.1]. 
Anemia 
4 subjects (28.6%) in the pediatric sub-set experienced AEs of hemoglobin decrease during the MAESTRO / 
MAESTRO OL studies [Table 16]. None of the AEs were reported as serious. 1 subject prematurely discontinued 
MAESTRO OL study drug due to the AE of hemoglobin decrease. 1 subject was discussed in the Clinical Overview 
addendum written for the MAESTRO study [D-17.321, section 5.3.1]. 
A  second  subject  experienced  a  decrease  of  hemoglobin  of  mild  intensity  on  MAESTRO  OL  Day  910,  when 
hemoglobin concentration was 103 g/L (normal range 120–160 g/L) compared to 137 g/L (normal range 135–
175 g/L) on OL Day 1. Study treatment was continued at the same dose and the event remained unresolved at 
the end of the study. On Day 1060 (EOT visit) the subject’s hemoglobin was 126 g/L. 
A third subject experienced decreased hemoglobin of mild intensity on MAESTRO OL Day 813, when hemoglobin 
concentration was 135 g/L, compared to 158 g/L on MAESTRO OL Day 1 (normal range 120–160 g/L). Study

treatment continued at the same dose and the event remained unresolved at the end of the study. On Day 1240 
(end-ofstudy [EOS] visit), the subject’s hemoglobin concentration was 163 g/L. 
A fourth subject experienced 3 events of decrease of hemoglobin on MAESTRO OL on Days 92, 358, and 806. 
The subject’s hemoglobin concentration on MAESTRO OL Day 1 was 192 g/L, and decreased to 169 g/L, 153 g/L, 
and  163  g/L  on  Days  92,  358,  and  806,  respectively  (normal  range  120–160  gL).  The  subject  prematurely 
discontinued MAESTRO OL study treatment on Day 1184; on this day hemoglobin concentration was 151 g/L. On 
Day 1198 (EOS visit), the subject’s hemoglobin concentration was 158 g/L. 
For context, 37 subjects (16.7%) in the overall MAESTRO OL population had at least 1 AE related to anemia in 
the MAESTRO / MAESTRO OL studies, and 8 subjects discontinued study treatment due to anemia/decreased 
hemoglobin AEs [D-18.003, section 12.3.5.1]. 
Marked laboratory abnormalities relevant to anemia 
No subjects in the pediatric sub-set had hemoglobin decreases from baseline to ≤ 100 g/L or decreases from 
baseline of ≥ 50 g/L [Table 19]. For context, 3 subjects in the overall MAESTRO OL population had a marked 
reduction of hemoglobin values to > 80 and ≤ 100 g/L, and 19 subjects had decreases from baseline of ≥ 50 g/L 
[D-18.003, section 12.3.5.1]. 
Hypotension 
1  pediatric  subject  (7.1%)  experienced  an  AE  related  to  hypotension  during  the  MAESTRO  /  MAESTRO  OL 
studies [Table 17]. The event of hypotension on MAESTRO OL Day 782 was moderate in intensity and considered 
non-serious and related to the study drug by the investigator. Study treatment was continued at the same dose. 
The event was unresolved at the end of the study. For context, 8 subjects (3.6%) in the overall MAESTRO OL 
population had at least 1 AE related to hypotension in the MAESTRO / MAESTRO OL studies [D-18.003, section 
12.3.5.2]. 
Edema and fluid overload 
No pediatric subject had an AE related to edema and fluid overload during the MAESTRO / MAESTRO OL studies 
[Table 18]. For context, 27 subjects (12.2%) in the overall MAESTRO OL population experienced at least 1 AE 
related to edema and fluid overload [D-18.003, section 12.3.5.3]. 
Liver tests 
1 pediatric subject had treatment-emergent liver test abnormalities > 3 × upper limit of the normal range (ULN) 
during  the  MAESTRO  /  MAESTRO  OL  studies.  This  subject  was  discussed  in  the  addendum  to  the  Clinical 
Overview  for  the  MAESTRO  study  [D-17.321].  The  event  was  not  serious  and  did  not  lead  to  premature 
discontinuation  of  study  treatment  [D-18.003,  section  12.3.5.4].  For  context,  there  were  5  cases  of 
treatment-emergent  liver  test  abnormalities  >  3  ×  ULN  in  the  overall  MAESTRO  OL  population  [D-18.003, 
section 12.3.5.4]. 
Assessor’s comments 
Overall, the available data indicate that the safety profile of macitentan in adolescent pediatric subjects, at the 
same dose as in adults (10 mg o.d.), is similar to that in adults.  
Again, the limited data from the MAESTRO study do not allow any meaningful clinical assessment of the safety 
macitentan in the pediatric ES population.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
A total of 14 pediatric subjects were treated with macitentan in the MAESTRO OL study at the same dose used 
in adults (10 mg once daily [o.d.]). The exploratory efficacy data collected in pediatric subjects do not suggest 
any potential difference in terms of response compared to the overall patient population. However, the limited 
data  from  do  not  allow  any  meaningful  clinical  assessment  of  the  efficacy  of  macitentan  in  the  pediatric 
Eisenmenger Syndrome population. 
Overall, the safety data were consistent with those seen in the overall MAESTRO OL population both in frequency 
and distribution/type of AE. No deaths were reported in pediatric subjects. SAEs and AEs leading to premature 
discontinuation of study treatment were reported for pediatric subjects at rates similar to those reported for the 
overall MAESTRO OL population. Consequently, the available data indicate that the safety profile of macitentan 
in adolescent pediatric subjects, at the same dose as in adults (10 mg o.d.), is similar to that in adults and is 
aligned with the safety section in the approved labeling information of Opsumit. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
In the absence of any significant new data on effectiveness or new safety concerns, there is no need for an 
update of the product information. In accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data 
submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance and therefore do not require further regulatory action on the 
marketing authorisation for the above mentioned product.

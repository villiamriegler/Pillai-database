Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pembrolizumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on cholangitis sclerosing from literature and spontaneous reports including in 
some close temporal relationship, improvement following steroid treatment, and in view of a plausible 
mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pembrolizumab and cholangitis 
sclerosing is at least a reasonable possibility. 
In view of available data on gastritis from clinical trials, the literature, and gastritis listed for the class 
product nivolumab, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pembrolizumab and gastritis is at 
least a reasonable possibility.  
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing pembrolizumab should be 
amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pembrolizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pembrolizumab is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

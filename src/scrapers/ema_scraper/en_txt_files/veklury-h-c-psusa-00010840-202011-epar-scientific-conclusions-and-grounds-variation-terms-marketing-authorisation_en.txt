Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for remdesivir, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In view of available data on sinus bradycardia from spontaneous reports, including some cases with a 
close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, the PRAC Rapp considers a causal relationship 
between remdesivir and sinus bradycardia is at least a reasonable possibility. Additionally, as the  mean 
age of patients  admitted to hospital with  COVID-19 is about 70 years, and many have cardiovascular 
disease or hypertension and often take β-blockers which could cause bradycardia too, it  is important 
that  treating physicians will  be informed about all new consequences. Therefore, the product 
information section 4.8 should be amended accordingly. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction of sinus bradycardia with a frequency of 
not known. The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for remdesivir the CHMP is of the opinion that  the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing remdesivir is unchanged subject to  the proposed 
changes to  the product information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
The International Continence Society defines Overactive bladder (OAB) as urgency, with or without 
urge incontinence associated with increased micturition frequency and nocturia.1 Its aetiology is not 
completely clear, but involves detrusor overactivity, a status of increased sensitivity of the bladder to 
contraction-mediating transmitters and mediators originating from the urothelium2 Detrusor over-
activation involves afferent signalling conveyed as bladder sensations that are felt as urgency in 
patients with OAB.3  
The overall prevalence of OAB in Europe has been estimated to be 16.6% on the basis of a population-
based survey (15.6% for men and 17.4% for women). There is a female-to-male preponderance in the 
prevalence of OAB with urge urinary incontinence, while OAB without urge urinary incontinence is more 
prevalent in men. 
The prevalence of OAB symptomatology increased with advancing age in both men and women (41.9% 
of men and 31.3% of women over the age of 75 years). Obesity relates also with an increase in the 
prevalence of OAB.  
The functional integrity of the lower urinary tract, the kidneys, and the nervous system (predominantly 
under the control of the parasympathetic nervous system) are the key factors to maintain continence 
and bladder function. Bladder function involves a bladder filling and urine storage phase, which leads 
to a bladder emptying phase. A stable bladder wall muscle (detrusor) and a functional sphincter allow 
bladder filling during the storage phase. 
Undesired bladder muscle contraction may occur as the result of a break in the neurological pathway 
from the brain to the bladder. It can also occur if the bladder is irritated and the normal neurological 
impulses to inhibit urination are insufficient to keep the bladder relaxed as it fills. 
Although OAB is not life threatening, symptoms may affect quality of life. Patients consider urinary 
leakage, frequency and urgency to be bothersome. Complications and comorbidities include urinary 
tract infection (UTI), skin ulceration in OAB with urge incontinence, and a greater risk of bone fracture 
from a fall, although some research has found little association. Sleep disturbances, restricted mobility, 
isolation and depression are described as the psychological and lifestyle related consequences of OAB. 
Treatment may be managed using nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies. Nonpharmacologic 
treatment includes lifestyle changes (controlled fluid intake), behavioural therapies, pelvic floor 
electrical stimulation, and surgical procedures. 
The pharmacotherapeutic treatment options indicated for OAB are aimed at reducing or suppressing 
the intensity of involuntary detrusor contractions. Anticholinergic agents such as solifenacin, 
oxybutynin, trospium, darifenacin, tolterodine and fesoterodine are the most commonly used. Non 
pharmacologic treatment options contain behavioural techniques, neuromodulaton and surgery.

About the product 
Mirabegron is a selective agonist for human beta 3-adrenoceptor (beta 3-AR) which is dominant in the 
human detrusor muscle. Activation of beta-AR in the bladder trigone facilitates urine storage through 
flattening and lengthening of the bladder base.4  
Mirabegron dose-dependently increased cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations 
in bladder tissues isolated from rats and showed a potent relaxant effect in isolated rat and human 
bladder strips precontracted with carbachol at low contraction tonus. 
The drug product is formulated as prolonged release film coated tablets. The tablets are formulated as 
a hydrophilic gel-forming matrix tablet formulation, designed for continuous drug release throughout 
the GI tract.  
The claimed and approved indication for Betmiga is for the symptomatic treatment of urgency, 
increased micturition frequency and/or urgency incontinence as may occur in patients with overactive 
bladder (OAB) syndrome. 
The proposed posology is 50 mg once daily with or without food. In patients with severe renal 
impairment or with moderate hepatic impairment, the recommended dose of mirabegron is 25 mg 
orally once daily with or without food. 
Type of application and aspects on development 
This application is submitted as a centralised procedure according to Article 8(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC (i.e. a dossier with administrative, quality, pre-clinical and clinical data). 
The initial clinical development program examined an indication of type 2 diabetes mellitus and was 
subsequently discontinued due to the absence of efficacy demonstrated in this population based on 
proof of concept studies. A total of 29 phase 1 studies and 12 phase 2 and 3 studies (9 in patients with 
OAB, 1 in patients with LUTS/BOO and 2 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus) have been 
conducted globally in Europe, the US, Canada, Japan, Australia/New Zealand and South Africa. 
The primary studies to support efficacy of mirabegron were designed consistent with Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidance for the clinical investigation of medicinal products 
for urinary incontinence. Further, the company received national scientific advice from the Competent 
Authorities in the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain during the development programme. In general, the 
recommendations from the authorities were followed. 
A Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for mirabegron was submitted to the EMA Pediatric Committee 
(PDCO), and a positive opinion was fowarded to the applicant in August 2010; the measures of the 
agreed PIP were deferred at the time of the submission of the MAA.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as prolonged released film coated tablet containing 25 and 50 mg of 
mirabegron as the active substance. The composition is described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in the primary packaging as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Mirabegron is a white crystalline powder, not hygroscopic and freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, 
soluble in methanol and soluble in water between neutral to acidic pH. The chemical name is 2-(2-
Amino-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)-N-[4-(2-{[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2- phenylethyl]amino}ethyl)phenyl]acetamide. The 
molecular formula is C21H24N4O2S and has the following structural formula: 
Mirabegron exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The R enantiomer has 
been used in the manufacture of the finished product. The enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely 
by chiral HPLC-UV. Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. The polymorphic form α 
is routinely and consistently produced by the synthetic process and it is used in the manufacture of the 
finished product.  
Full information on the active substance mirabegron is provided in the dossier. 
Manufacture 
Mirabegron is synthesized in five main steps using commercially available and well defined starting 
materials. The final active substance is purified by crystallisation. The manufacturing process is well 
described. The defined critical process parameters (CPPs) and proposed in-process tests are considered 
suitable. All relevant parameters are controlled within the specified ranges in order to maintain the 
quality of the active substance.  
Two manufacturing sites are involved in the synthesis of this active substance.  
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented  
For the manufacturing process development the applicant has applied the Quality by Design (QbD) 
approach based on the risk-assessment of the synthetic process. The risk-assessment has provided 
valuable information to understand the synthetic process. In summary, the QbD principles were used 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 9/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
only during the drug development in order to optimise the manufacturing conditions. No design space 
has been established for manufacturing process of the active substance. 
The  purified  active  substance  is  packed  in  double  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  bags,  closed  by 
cable-ties and placed inside sealed fiber drums.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: identification (UV, IR), heavy metals, impurities 
(HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), microbiology 
limit test (Eur.), Palladium content (ICP-AES) and assay (HPLC, 98.0– 102.0%).  
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was 
provided for the in-house analytical methods and are in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. 
In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The 
impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data on eleven commercial batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Six production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial packaging 
(LDPE bags) from the proposed manufacturer were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: 
under long term (25°C/60%RH) for up 24 months, and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months. 
The  active  substance  used  in  the  primary  stability  studies  was  manufactured  by  a  process  that  is 
representative  of  the  commercial  process.  The  following  parameters  were  tested  in  the  primary 
stability  studies:  appearance,  identification,  X-ray  diffraction,  thermal  analysis,  impurities,  water 
content, microbial contamination and assay. 
Photostability testing following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch. The results showed 
that only the appearance of the active substance slightly changed when exposed to light for two 
months.  
Forced degradation studies were conducted by exposing the active substance to high temperature, 
high humidity, acid, base, oxidative and high intensity light conditions. Based on the results only minor 
degradation of mirabegron was noted. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Mirabegron prolonged released film coated tablets have been developed to control the drug release 
from the tablet, leading to a slower absorption rate in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract compared to 
immediate release formulations, even in fasted conditions. 
During the development several modified released formulations were evaluated. Based on the results 
of the experimental studies the OCAS was selected as a modified release platform that could achieve 
the quality target product profile. 
The OCAS is a hydrophilic gel-forming matrix tablet formulation, composed of active substance and 
Macrogols. This matrix tablet formulation designed for continuous drug release in the human GI tract.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 10/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The solubility of the selected gel forming agent and gel-enhancing agent are pH-independent. 
Therefore, drug release from prolonged released film coated tablets is relatively unaffected by different 
pH dissolution media. 
Mirabegron prolonged released film coated tablets were developed using QbD principles. The CQAs 
identified were dissolution, appearance, assay, uniformity of dosage units, impurities, stability Prior 
knowledge, risk assessment, design of experiments and mathematical models were applied to identify 
the and CPPs. The CPPs have been adequately established. The QbD approach was also used to 
optimise the manufacturing conditions.  
It can be concluded that the QbD principles were used for optimisation of the final formulation as well 
as for the development of the manufacturing process, but no Design Space is claimed for the 
manufacturing of the finished product. 
The primary packaging proposed is described as stated in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The material 
complies with Ph. Eur. requirements and it is adequate to support the stability and use of the medicinal 
product. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of eight main steps: mixing, granulation, pulverization, blending, 
compression, dispersing, coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process has been validated at commercial scale for both strengths and has been 
demonstrated to be capable to reproducibly produce a finished product of the intended quality. The in- 
process controls are adequate.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specification  includes  appropriate  tests  for  appearance  (visual), 
identification  (UV,  HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur),  dissolution,  water 
content (Ph. Eur), microbial limit test (Ph. Eur) and assay (95.0%-105.0%). 
Batch analysis results in three commercial batches of 25 mg and four commercial batches of 50 mg 
batches confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under 
control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three batches of each strength have been provided. The batches were stored under 
long term conditions at 25ºC/60%RH for up to 36 months and under accelerated conditions at 
40ºC/75%RH for up to 6 months according to ICH guidelines. These batches of medicinal product are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 11/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The stability samples were tested for appearance, impurities, dissolution, assay, water content, 
hardness, BHT content and microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used were stability 
indicating. 
Forced degradation tests were performed under high temperatures, high humidity and high 
temperature/high humidity. These tests demonstrated no major changes in the parameters specified of 
the finished product. Only the increase of the dissolution rate was observed. 
In addition, the photostability of one batch of each strength was evaluated in accordance with ICH 
guideline Q1B (Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products). Based on the results 
there is no need to protect the finished product from light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The Applicant used the Quality by Design principles in this 
application during the pharmaceutical development but a design space was not claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance neither for the finished product. Risk assessment was 
done to optimise the manufacturing conditions of the active substance. For the finished product, the 
Quality by Design approach was used for optimisation of the formulation as well as for the 
development of the manufacturing process. The control strategy and process validation follow the 
traditional approach. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
2.2.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.5.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development  
None  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive non-clinical programme has been performed covering studies to investigate 
pharmacology including safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics as well as toxicology including single 
and repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and

development. The studies have been performed in rats, mice, rabbits, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys. 
Drug administration was performed IV. or per os, mimicking the human route of administration. 
No scientific advice was received from the European Medicines Agency on non-clinical development. 
Toxicology and some of the definitive safety pharmacology studies conducted by the applicant were 
reported to be GLP-compliant. The safety studies that were not conducted to GLP were conducted to 
appropriate scientific standards prevailing at that time. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro, mirabegron has substantially higher (150-and 33-fold) affinity for the β 3 adrenoceptor, when 
compared to the β 1 and β 2 adrenoceptors, respectively. Intrinsic activities relative to the maximum 
response induced by the full agonist isoproterenol, for mirabegron were 0.1, 0.2, and 0.8, for human 
β 1-, β 2- and β 3- ARs respectively. Functional studies to demonstrate agonism at the β-adrenoreceptors 
demonstrate that mirabegron is a selective β 3 adrenoceptor agonist with EC50 values in the nanomolar 
range. It has been established that mirabegron has weak agonistic activity at the β 1 and β 2 receptors 
in most of the species studied. However, it was observed that in vitro no functional agonism at the β 1 
or β 2 receptors occurred at concentrations that were at least 21-fold higher than that observed 
clinically. 
The effect on bladder smooth muscle was assessed in vitro in bladder tissues isolated from rats and 
humans. The results suggest a relaxant effect mediated by β 3-ARs in bladder strips precontracted with 
the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol with a maximum relaxant effect similar to isoproterenol. 
In vivo studies in anesthetized rats revealed that mirabegron decreased the resting intravesical 
pressure and also decreased the frequency of rhythmic bladder contractions without affecting the 
contraction force. Mirabegron increased cAMP concentrations in the isolated bladder (rat) at ≥1 µM and 
relaxed pre-contracted bladder smooth muscle (rat and human) with EC50 values of 5.1 to 11 µM and 
0.78 µM, respectively. The intracellular mechanisms for bladder relaxation in bladder strips pre-
contracted with carbachol and KCl is likely to be via an increase in cAMP and activation of Ca2+-
activated K+ (BKCa) channels, respectively and it is noted that not all of the mechanistic aspects have 
been demonstrated experimentally. It is evident that the three β-adrenoceptor subtypes (i.e. β 1, β 2 
and β 3) are expressed in human detrusor muscle and with the aid of selective antagonists for the β 1 
and β 2 adrenoceptors, the Applicant has demonstrated that the bladder relaxant effect of mirabegron 
in the rat may be mediated by the β 3-receptor.  
In vivo data from conscious water loaded cynomolgus monkeys reveal that mirabegron increased the 
micturition mean voided volume and decreased voiding frequency. Intravenously administered 
mirabegron reduced resting and elevated intravesical pressure in the rat (at ≥0.03 mg/kg) and dog (at 
≥0.0003 mg/kg), respectively. In a rat model of hyperactive bladder (cerebral infarction model), 
mirabegron increased the mean voided volume per micturition. In rats with partial urethral obstruction, 
mirabegron decreased the frequency of non-voiding contractions without affecting the voided volume 
per micturition, voiding pressure, or residual urine volume. It was noted that mirabegron at 3 mg/kg 
had no effect on the voided volume in a rat model of partial urethral obstruction, while this dose was 
previously shown to be effective in the rat and monkey. The differences in the underlying pathology of 
and experimental methods for the animal models may be responsible for the observed differences in 
the effects on voided volume in the rat.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The secondary pharmacology of mirabegron was studied. Mirabegron and the human metabolites M5 
and M16 inhibited the binding of specific ligands to the α1A-receptor (rat), muscarinic M2 receptor 
(human), sodium channel site 2 (rat), dopamine transporter (human), and/or norepinephrine 
transporter (human) at 10 µM. The Applicant has suggested that any secondary pharmacological 
effects would be attributed to mirabegron as opposed to the M5 or M16 metabolite. The Ki values for 
the secondary targets listed above were at least ~22-fold higher than the clinical Cmax. Given the 
magnitude of the observed margin and the adverse event profile observed clinically, the observed 
interactions at the secondary targets do not appear to be clinically relevant. 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that mirabegron possesses lipolytic activity at nanomolar 
concentrations. In vivo, mirabegron caused an increase in energy expenditure and body temperature 
and improved glucose intolerance in genetically obese rodents at doses known to have effects on 
bladder function. The effects of mirabegron on lipolysis do not translate to non-rodent species. 
Although mirabegron may affect non-esterified fatty acid levels following administration of a single 
dose, mirabegron has no discernable effect on lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism or body 
temperature upon repeated administration in healthy subjects and/or in diabetes mellitus patients. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Central nervous system findings in rats and mice included decreased locomotor activity, decreased grip 
strength, lateral position, palpebral closure, and at higher doses deep respiration, decreased muscle 
tone, prone position, and loss of righting reflex. CNS depression was reported at exposures close to 
clinical exposures. These findings were transient and no relevant CNS findings were identified in the 
cynomolgus monkey at significantly higher exposures than those proposed clinically. 
Assessment of mirabegron on hERG current in HEK293 revealed an Ikr inhibition of 14.7% at 
30 µmol/L although this concentration was more than 600-fold the unbound Cmax at the maximum 
recommended human dose (MRHD). Mirabegron metabolites M5 and M16 inhibited hERG current, with 
respective IC50 values of 21 and 31 µmol/L, and 17.3% for M14, although at concentrations 
considerably higher than the human expected Cmax. The observed effects of mirabegron on cardiac 
muscle action potential were not significant, although M5 at 3 µmol/L prolonged slightly APD30 by 6.1% 
and shortened APD30-90 by 7.9%, while concentrations of 30 µmol/L prolonged APD30 by 5.6% and 
APD90 by 4.7%. M16 prolonged APD90 by 5.0% at 30 µmol/L. Assessment of mirabegron on the effect 
on arterially perfused canine ventricular wedge preparations did not reveal demonstrable 
pro-arrhythmic effects of mirabegron and its metabolites. 
Following oral administration in the dog, a reduction in QT interval was observed at 10 mg/kg; when 
corrected for heart rate, an increase in QTc interval was apparent (at ≥0.3 mg/kg) upon application of 
Bazett’s or Van der Water equations, while no effect on QTc was reported upon application of the 
Matsunaga equation. The Applicant has supplied references in order to support the use of the 
Matsunaga equation as opposed to the Van de Water equation (Matsunaga et al., 1998; Miyazaki, 
2002). In the monkey, an increase in PR and QRS interval was noted at 100 mg/kg and no effects 
were reported on QT/QTcB/QTcF interval or body temperature following single oral administration of up 
to 100 mg/kg. However, the 52 week repeated dose study conducted in both males and females has 
demonstrated sporadic increases QTcB interval at 30 mg/kg. The corresponding Cmax (at Week 52) was 
~11-fold higher than that proposed clinically; hence, these data do not indicate any potential for QT 
prolongation in man at the proposed clinical dose of 50 mg. A post authorisation safety study to further 
characterise the cardiovascular safety of mirabegron has been requested (see Clinical Safety), as 
detailed in the Risk Management Plan.

Oral administration to conscious dogs and monkeys showed that mirabegron caused an increase in 
heart rate. In the dog, mirabegron (at ≥0.03 mg/kg) increased heart rate (and shortened PR interval), 
at doses lower than those proposed clinically. Systolic and mean arterial blood pressures were also 
significantly decreased at 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. In the cynomolgus monkey, mirabegron increased heart 
rate at 10 mg/kg (Cmax approx 29.6-fold higher than that observed at the MRHD). 
Single intravenous administration of mirabegron to conscious dogs caused death due to ventricular 
fibrillation at 10 mg/kg) and ECG findings were reported from doses of 0.3 mg/kg (HED corresponds to 
0.2-fold MRHD). Other findings included increased heart rate, decreased mean blood pressure, absent 
P-wave, prolonged QRS interval, and ventricular tachycardia. The Applicant suggests that increases in 
heart rate observed in rats, dogs, and monkeys are mediated via cross activation of the beta 1-
adrenoceptor (beta 1-AR). Heart rate increases and ECG changes together with histopathological 
findings were only reported in dogs at lethal doses while histopathological findings observed in the 
heart in monkeys were limited to the fat tissue surrounding the heart (small adipocytes and 
multivacuolated cytoplasm) with no histopathological findings in the cardiomyocytes. In humans at the 
MRHD the heart rate increase was limited to approximately 1 bpm. In non clinical studies at doses 
where smaller increases in heart rates were observed, no histopathological findings were noted. 
Studies carried out in cynomolgus monkeys receiving a single oral dose of mirabegron, did not reveal 
effects on the respiratory system. Mirabegron administration to dogs increased respiratory rate and 
decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide in blood at 3 mg/kg. The mechanistic process underlying 
this event in dogs was not investigated as it was only reported in one species and was not observed in 
humans at doses up to 6-fold higher than the MRHD. 
In vitro, mirabegron inhibited contraction of guinea-pig ileum at concentrations below the proposed 
clinical Cmax (free). There is evidence to suggest that the administration of β3 agonists (of comparable 
potency) is associated with a decrease in gastrointestinal motility, nonetheless the Applicant has 
demonstrated that although mirabegron inhibited contraction of the guinea pig ileum in vitro, no 
effects on gastrointestinal transit were reported in vivo, in the mouse, rat, dog or monkey. More 
importantly, repeated administration for 7 days at 50 or 100 mg/day had no effect on gastrointestinal 
transit in man. 
Even though there was no effect on urine excretion in rats receiving single dose administration of 
mirabegron at low doses, higher doses of ≥ 10 mg/kg, revealed that urine volume and the amount of 
electrolytes excreted was variable with time and dosing. In the rat, mirabegron at ≥10 mg/kg 
(equivalent to ≥1.9-fold the human equivalent dose) reduced the levels of sodium, potassium and 
chloride excreted into the urine during the first 3 hours post-dose. In rat toxicity studies of a longer 
duration, (26 week) effects on electrolytes and urine volume were also observed. Given that the 
intrinsic activity of mirabegron for the β 1-receptor is higher in the rat and the absence of effects in 
dogs and monkeys, the CHMP consider these effects to be due to cross activation of the β 1 receptor. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted, which is accepted. The 
potential for pharmacodynamic interactions between mirabegron and concomitantly administered 
medicinal products has been addressed in the Clinical Dossier with clinical data. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The analytical methods used were validated and considered to be sufficiently accurate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012

Absorption 
Mirabegron absorption was studied after single and repeated dose administration in fasted and non 
fasted males (rat, mouse and dog). The absorption profile in females was generally consistent with 
that observed in male rats after oral administration.  
Mirabegron was well and rapidly absorbed in the species tested. In rats the mean in situ absorption 
into each loop of gastrointestinal tract was variable with the highest values reported in the small 
intestine accounting for duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were 55.5%, 61.7%, and 65.9% of absorption 
respectively and the lowest in the stomach and colon at 7.1% and 15.1%, respectively. 
Mean peak plasma concentrations in a single dose administration study in fasted rats and monkeys 
were observed at 3 h and 0.25 h post-dose, respectively. The AUCinf of mirabegron in plasma was low 
for both species accounting for 18 and 5% of total radioactivity in plasma confirming that metabolites 
accounted for a significant proportion of the drug-related material. 
Absolute bioavailability in rats was 23.0%, 48.4%, and 75.7% at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, 
respectively, and in dogs 41.8%, 64.6%, and 77.1% at doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg, respectively. 
A single oral dose study in fasted and fed dogs revealed that the mean tmax value for mirabegron 
administered was independent of the feeding status; however, Cmax and AUCinf values under fed 
conditions were 78.5% and 65.8%, respectively, of those under the fasted conditions, suggesting that 
mirabegron absorption was reduced in the presence of food. 
Repeated dosing of mirabegron in non fasted male rats for 21 days indicate that the AUC24h and Cmax 
increased with dose and that steady state was achieved by Day 17.  
Distribution 
When single doses of mirabegron were intravenously administered to rats (1 mg/kg) and dogs 
(0.1 mg/kg), total body clearance (CLtot) was high for both species at 47.4 and 37.2 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. Also, the steady state distribution volume (Vss) was large in both species at 10.3 and 
14.3 L/kg, respectively, indicating that mirabegron is extensively distributed. 
Plasma protein binding of mirabegron in vivo in man was 71%. Albumin was estimated to be the main 
human plasma protein responsible for the binding of mirabegron, followed by alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. 
Mirabegron distribution to erythrocytes was reported and the in vitro blood/plasma radioactivity 
concentration ratio of 14C-mirabegron was fairly similar for all species; ranging from 1.41 to 1.43 in 
humans. 
Radioactivity distributed to all organs with the lowest value reported in the GI tract. The highest was 
found in the liver and kidney and the lowest in the cerebrum and cerebellum remaining low after 
repeated administration. In albino and pigmented rats, at 168 and 360 hours post-dose, most tissues 
showed less than 10% of their peak radioactivity concentrations. Pigmented rats showed 18-fold 
higher peak values of radioactivity in the eyeball compared to that observed in albino rats and the 
elimination half-life of radioactivity from the eyeball was estimated to be 157 days. A high percentage 
of the radioactivity corresponded to metabolites (with no pharmacological activity). 
In pregnant rats, low levels of mirabegron-derived components crossed the placental barrier and were 
transferred to the fetus. Mirabegron-derived components were excreted into the milk.

Metabolism 
Mirabegron is metabolized via multiple pathways involving dealkylation, oxidation, glucuronidation, and 
amide hydrolysis. The metabolic rate was faster in cynomolgus monkeys, followed by dogs and rats, 
then humans. Metabolites generated by human microsomes were also formed by at least one of the 
animal species examined. A total of 18 metabolites from mirabegron were identified in plasma, urine 
and/or bile from male mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys and humans. In human urine and plasma, ten 
and eight metabolites were identified respectively. All the metabolites found in human plasma were 
also observed either in rat or cynomolgus monkey plasma, suggesting that both species are relevant 
species for toxicity studies. 
Excretion 
After oral administration of 14C-mirabegron at 10 mg/kg in the rat, elimination of radioactivity 
accounted for 94.1% of the total radioactivity (18.8% in the urine and 75.3% in the feces). When the 
same dose was administered to the monkey, the overall radioactivity recovered accounted for 101% 
(46.8% in urine and 54.2% in feces) while in bile duct cannulated male rat, the excretion rate of 
radioactivity was 37.3% in the urine and 29.4% in the bile suggesting that enterohepatic circulation 
occurs in this species. In humans, urine and fecal excretion accounted for 55.0% and 34.2% 
respectively. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Mirabegron was administered to fasting rats at single oral doses of 300, 500, and 800 mg/kg and 
observed for mortality and general conditions for 14 days. The lethal dose of mirabegron was ≥ 800 
mg/kg. Other findings reported in the study included hypoactivity, salivation and lacrimation in all 
groups. Chromodacryorrhea was observed at 300 mg/kg and prone position together with loss of body 
weight at ≥ 500 mg/kg, while clonic convulsion was reported at 800 mg/kg. Necropsy of one dead male 
at 800 mg/kg revealed a pale liver. Histopathological examination showed hepatocyte hypertrophy and 
vacuolar degeneration around the liver lobule. 
Mirabegron was also administered to dogs as a single oral dose of 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 mg/kg to one male 
and one female beagle dog per group. The lethal dose of mirabegron was ≥ 30 mg/kg. Skin reddening 
and  increased  heart  rate  was  observed  in  all  groups.  Vomiting  was  reported  in  the  30  mg/kg  group. 
Histopathological  examination  revealed  focal  acinar  dilatation/  disruption  in  the  zygomatic  gland  at 
0.3 and 3 mg/kg while necrosis of the zygomatic gland was reported at 30 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Mirabegron was extensively studied in oral repeated dose studies in mice (two weeks), rats (26 
weeks), dogs (two weeks) and monkeys (52 weeks). Additional short term studies were also carried 
out by intravenous repeated dose administration in rats and monkeys.  
Table 1: Repeated Dose Toxicity Studies with Mirabegron 
Assessment report

In the mouse, repeated oral administration of mirabegron for 5 days, resulted in the death of an 
animal at 300 mg/kg. The animal showed decreased spontaneous movement and clonic convulsion. 
Dose related increase of the frequency of reduced spontaneous movement was reported; a finding that 
was also reported during a 2-week study, tended to diminish with repeated administration. Plasma 
concentration increased dose proportionally up to 100 mg/kg but thereafter the increase was less than 
proportional with dose. Increased food consumption and increases in red blood cell count, haemoglobin 
and hematocrit were reported. Blood chemistry showed non-dose or gender related changes. Liver 
weight was increased. In males, heart, lung and spleen weights were also increased. Decreased lipid 
droplet size in the brown and reduced adipocyte size with multi-vacuolated cytoplasm in the white fat 
were reported. Extramedullary hematopoiesis was identified in both genders at 100 mg/kg and 
increased pale areas of hepatocytes were reported in males. A NOAEL was not identified. There were 
no marked differences in C max or AUC0-24h on repeated dosing.  
Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats revealed enzyme increases in plasma aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels at dose levels of 
mirabegron of ≥ 30 mg/kg. In a 13-week study, hepatocyte necrosis was observed at doses of ≥100 
mg/kg; however, these findings were not observed at the same dose levels following 26 weeks of daily 
administration. 
Decreased locomotor activity was reported at high doses of ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in a 2 week study and 
prone position was noted at 3 mg/kg in males and 10 mg/kg in females (systemic exposures of 0.3 
and 1.7-fold the human exposure at MRHD, respectively). Decreased platelet counts were seen in all 
rat studies at 100 mg/kg and alterations in reticulocyte counts at 300 mg/kg although the latter was 
only observed during a 2-week repeated dose study. Triglycerides were decreased in rat studies from 
doses of 10 mg/kg (2.7-fold of the exposure at the MRHD). Reversible eosinophilic changes were noted 
in liver hepatocytes of rats administered mirabegron. Electron microscopic evaluation of this finding 
suggested that the eosinophilic changes were the result of a decrease in the number of glycogen 
particles in the hepatocytes.  
Renal effects of mirabegron were limited to changes in urine volume and electrolyte excretion in rats 
and were probably due to the pharmacological effects of the drug.

Studies in the dog were of short duration and the main findings were of a cardiovascular nature. Skin 
reddening and ventricular tachycardia (and subsequent death) at 20 mg/kg were reported. At 
≥ 10 mg/kg, a clear increase in heart rate was reported, together with ECG increases in P wave 
duration, QRS interval and T wave amplitude prolongation and a reduction in P-R interval. Swelling 
around the eyes, ocular discharge and/or reddened sclera and the microscopic pathology findings of 
degeneration/inflammation of the zygomatic salivary gland were reported at ≥ 3 mg/kg. At 20 mg/kg, 
vacuolation in the liver was observed in males and myocardial degeneration of the left ventricle in 
females. Endocardial hemorrhage in the left ventricle of the heart, periportal vacuolation of the liver, 
focal areas of loss of blood in the red pulp of the spleen, and hemorrhage/congestion of the thymus 
were observed in females at 20 mg/kg that died during the treatment period. The implications of 
cardiovascular findings have been discussed previously. As the 20 mg/kg dose was lethal to some of 
the animals it could not be repeatedly administered to surviving animals. In a 3-day study in dogs, 
slight increases of liver enzymes and hepatocellular hypertrophy were noted at a lethal dose; these 
changes were reversible in surviving animals.  
Repeated dose studies in the cynomolgus monkey demonstrated ventricular tachycardia at 60 mg/kg. 
In a 13-week study, ventricular tachycardia was reported in one animal at 30 mg/kg/day at one time 
point and was confirmed in a 52-week repeated-dose monkey study at the same dose. The PR interval 
tended to be prolonged in both males and females at ≥ 10 mg/kg. Following IV administration, 
transient ventricular tachycardia and prolongation of the PR interval was observed at ≥ 1 mg/kg/day, 
as well as a slight transient prolongation of the QRS interval at 3 mg/kg/day. 
Genotoxicity 
Mirabegron as assessed by the bacterial reverse mutation test, the human peripheral blood lymphocyte 
chromosomal aberration test and the rat micronucleus test was not genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
Repeated administration of mirabegron to mice and rats for 104 weeks did not reveal a potential to 
cause carcinogenicity at doses up to 100 mg/kg.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies to evaluate the effect of mirabegron on fertility and early embryonic development in the rat 
revealed no effects on male fertility up to 100 mg/kg, although it has been reported that 14 males at 
300 mg/kg died. It should be noted that half of the untreated females that copulated with the males in 
this group were non-pregnant and the numbers of corpora lutea, implantations and live embryos were 
lower in 3 pregnant non treated females. In female rats at 300 mg/kg, prolonged diestrus was 
observed, as was a decrease in the number of corpora lutea, implantations and live fetuses. A 
reduction in the size of the prostate, seminal vesicles and uterus was noted during the repeated dose 
studies in the rat. In addition, regression of the X-zone adrenal glands in the female was noted 
following repeated oral administration for 13 weeks. The Applicant has clarified that the effects on 
reproduction are evident at lethal doses only and that fertility changes were reported at exposures that 
were 156- and 204- fold higher than the human exposure at MRHD in males and females respectively. 
Moreover, in the monkey, no effects on ovulation frequency or in male and female reproductive organs 
were reported in the 52-week study. The reduction in fertility and the effects on the seminal vesicles 
may be secondary to the general condition of the animals. The regression of the X-zone in the adrenal 
glands of the female rat, was a finding that could not be confirmed in any of the other studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012

Reduced fetal body weight, delayed ossification, wavy ribs and other skeletal anomalies were noted in 
rat embryofetal studies at exposures that are higher than those proposed clinically. Reduced fetal body 
weight, dilated aorta, cardiomegaly and increased post-implantation loss were noted during the rabbit 
embryofetal development study. The exposures at the NOAEL for embryo development are below those 
proposed clinically. The applicant has conducted follow-up investigative studies and the data suggest 
the observed cardiovascular malformations and post-implantation loss may be due to the activity of 
mirabegron or its metabolites at the β1-adrenoceptor. Therefore Mirabegron is not recommended 
during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. This is clearly 
labelled in the relevant parts of the SmPC. 
In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, mirabegron had no effects on reproductive function of 
the dams at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, and up to 30 mg/kg/day for the offspring. 
Toxicokinetic data 
See paragraphs above. 
Local Tolerance 
Local tolerance studies suggest that mirabegron was not irritant to rabbit skin following dermal 
application, but was irritant to the ocular mucosa of rabbits. Following intravenous administration of 
mirabegron, edema and erythema were observed at the injection site.  
In vitro studies revealed that mirabegron does not have the potential to cause hemolysis at the 
concentrations tested. 
In vivo studies in guinea pigs indicate that mirabegron shows a moderate skin sensitizing potential in 
the adjuvant/patch test and the Buehler test. 
Due to the characteristics and intended use of mirabegron, concerns related to dependence potential 
are not expected. 
Other toxicity studies 
The assessment of impurities was outlined in the quality dossier. The specification limit for the major 
impurity, YM181687 was set to 1%. The Applicant performed a qualification study with levels of 
Impurity YM181687 as high as 1.51%, including a 2-week toxicity study in rats. The study is 
considered acceptable as an increasing level of impurity YM181687 neither increased the toxicity nor 
changed the toxicity profile of mirabegron. The Applicant has also provided additional data (DEREK 
analysis) which demonstrates that YM181687 does not display an alert for genotoxicity. 
Mirabegron does not absorb light at the wavelengths in the range of 290-700 nm. Thus, there is no 
need for photosafety testing with this product. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has performed an environmental risk assessment for mirabegron. During the Phase I of 
the assessment, the calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) has resulted in a 
PECsurfacewater above 0.01 µg/L, and consequently a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis was 
carried out. The assessment of “Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic Systems’ study (OECD 308) was not

carried out according to OECD recommendations. Although the guideline requests to conduct both 
aerobic and anaerobic transformation the study only included data on aerobic transformation. The 
Applicant justified the lack of including an anaerobic assessment in the study as the ’Questions and 
Answers on 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010), states that this type of study would not be required for this type of 
medicinal product. This was considered acceptable and no further clarification with respect to the ERA 
is warranted.

In vitro, mirabegron has substantially higher affinity for the β 3 adrenoceptor, when compared to the β 1 
and β 2 adrenoceptors. No functional agonism at the β 1 or β 2 receptors occurred at concentrations that 
were at least 21-fold higher than that observed clinically. The results from studies with rat bladder 
strips suggest a relaxant effect mediated by β 3-ARs. 
In vivo studies in anesthetized rats revealed that mirabegron decreased the resting intravesical 
pressure and also decreased the frequency of rhythmic bladder contractions without affecting the 
contraction force. Given that the three β-adrenoceptor subtypes (i.e. β 1, β 2 and β 3) are expressed in 
human detrusor muscle, the Applicant has provided some evidence that the observed relaxation in the 
human bladder may be mediated by the β 3-receptor. However, not all of the mechanistic aspects have 
been demonstrated experimentally; hence, the CHMP recommended performing additional mechanistic 
studies post authorisation to elucidate whether human bladder relaxation induced by mirabegron is 
indeed mediated via the β 3-receptor. 
Oral administration to conscious dogs and monkeys showed that mirabegron caused an increase in 
heart rate. In the dog, mirabegron (at ≥0.03 mg/kg) increased heart rate (and shortened PR interval) 
at doses lower than those proposed clinically. Systolic and mean arterial blood pressures were also 
significantly decreased at 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. In the cynomolgus monkey, mirabegron increased heart 
rate at 10 mg/kg (Cmax approx 29.6 fold higher than that observed at the MRHD). 
After single intravenous administration of mirabegron to conscious dogs, heart rate increases and ECG 
changes together with histopathological findings were only reported in dogs at lethal doses while 
histopathological findings observed in the heart in monkeys were limited to the fat tissue surrounding 
the heart (small adipocytes and multivacuolated cytoplasm) with no histopathological findings in the 
cardiomyocytes. In humans at the MRHD the heart rate increase was limited to approximately 1 bpm.  
Non clinical studies in dogs and monkeys did not indicate any potential for QT prolongation in man at 
the proposed clinical dose of 50 mg. However, as sporadic increases in QTCB were observed following 
repeated administration to the monkey (where the C max was ~11-fold higher than that proposed 
clinically) and as an increase in QT prolongation has been observed at supra therapeutic doses in man, 
the Applicant was requested to conduct a post-authorisation study to further evaluate cardiovascular 
safety in man (see Clinical Safety), details of which has been included in the Risk Management Plan. 
Mirabegron absorption was studied after single and repeated dose administration in fasted and non 
fasted males (rat, mouse and dog). Mirabegron was well and rapidly absorbed in the species tested.  
Repeated dosing of mirabegron in non fasted male rats for 21 days indicate that the AUC24h and Cmax 
increased with increasing doses and steady state was achieved by Day 17.  
In pregnant rats, low levels of mirabegron-derived components crossed the placental barrier and were 
transferred to the fetus. Reduced fetal body weight, dilated aorta, cardiomegaly and increased post-
implantation loss were noted during the rabbit embryofetal development study at exposures that are 
higher than those proposed clinically and occurred at doses associated with maternal toxicity. 
However, the exposures at the NOAEL for embryo development are below those proposed clinically. 
Furthermore, mirabegron-derived components were excreted into the milk of rodents; hence, the 
SmPC clearly states that mirabegron is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception, and that mirabegron should not be administered during 
breast feeding. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have shown no genotoxic or carcinogenic potential in vivo.  
Based on environmental risk assessment studies, mirabegron is unlikely to represent a risk to the 
environment.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data which have been provided on the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and 
toxicological aspects of this application are sufficient to support the proposed indication. The SmPC 
adequately describes the information currently available. Regarding the mechanism of action, the 
CHMP recommends to carry out additional mechanistic studies in order to clarify whether mirabegron–
induced bladder relaxation is mediated via the β3-receptor in humans.  
The cardiovascular safety will be further characterised through the measures identified in the risk 
management plan, particularly a post-authorisation safety study (see Clinical Safety). The observed 
embryofetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits occurred at doses higher than those proposed 
clinically and the observed malformations are thought to be mediated via activation of the β 1-receptor. 
As a precautionary measure, the SmPC clearly states that mirabegron is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development program consists of 41 studies in patients with OAB, patients with lower 
urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/ bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), or patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. For a detailed description of the clinical data package relevant for the applied indication see 
chapter 2.5 Clinical efficacy. 
The initial clinical development program examined an indication of type 2 diabetes mellitus and was 
subsequently discontinued due to the absence of efficacy demonstrated in this population based on 
proof of concept studies. A total of 29 phase 1 studies and 12 phase 2 and 3 studies (9 in patients with 
OAB, 1 in patients with LUTS/BOO and 2 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus) have been 
conducted globally in Europe, the US, Canada, Japan, Australia/New Zealand and South Africa. 
The primary studies to support efficacy of mirabegron were designed consistent with Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidance for the clinical investigation of medicinal products 
for urinary incontinence. Further, the company received national scientific advice from national 
Competent Authorities. In general, the recommendations from the authorities were followed. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
There was a routine inspection for the product Betmiga (EMEA/H/C/002388) conducted at three 
investigator sites in relation to the pivotal clinical studies 178-CL-047 and 178-CL-074. In summary, 
the data presented in the concerning clinical study reports are accurately described and hence the data 
can be considered for the evaluation of the marketing authorisation application.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of mirabegron in plasma and urine were studied in healthy young and elderly 
volunteers, patients suffering from overactive bladder, diabetes mellitus, and patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment. 
A total of 29 studies were included to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron. Mirabegron and 
M5, M8, M11, M12, M13, M14, M15 and M16 metabolites were determined in plasma, urine, and feces. 
Standard procedures for non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis were applied. Three population 
pharmacokinetic analyses were performed.  
Absorption  
Mirabegron absorption is likely to be dose dependent. In the popPK analysis the total bioavailability of 
50 mg of mirablegron (OCAS-M formulation) was reported to be around 20%. However, a more than 
proportional increase in the bioavailability as a function of dose was reported. The higher the dose, the 
higher the proportion of the dose that is absorbed probably due to the saturation of active transport 
enzymes, and Pg-P. The absolute bioavailability of mirabegron OCAS tablets was shown to decrease 
with decreasing in vitro release rate. Administration of OCAS tablets with three different dissolution 
rates (OCAS-H (fast release), OCAS-M (Phase 3 OCAS) and OCAS-L (slow release)) demonstrated that 
the absolute bioavailability was highest for the fast release tablet and lowest for the slow release 
tablet. Mean absolute bioavailability estimates for OCAS-H, OCAS-M and OCAS-L tablets were 43%, 
35% and 30%, respectively, at a dose of 50 mg (study 178-CL-076). 
The absolute bioavailability (F) of a single oral dose of mirabegron OCAS under fasted conditions 
increased with dose, resulting in a more than dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUC with 
increasing oral dose from 50 to 150 mg. F averaged 24.3% for the 50 mg dose and 45.2% for the 150 
mg dose (study 178-CL-033).  
The food effect on mirabegron absorption is clear. With 50 mg tablets, the ratio and 90% CI values for 
AUCinf and Cmax of mirabegron were 17% lower (90% CI of the GM ratio: 74.16, 93.42) and 45% 
lower (90% CI of the GM ratio: 43.69, 68.65), respectively, after high-fat breakfast. Low-fat breakfast 
reduced the mean AUCinf and Cmax by 51% and 75%, respectively. The differential effect of a high-fat 
and low-fat meal on the bioavailability of mirabegron may be explained by a higher fraction that is 
adsorbed to contents of a low-fat breakfast, in particular cereal, compared with a high-fat breakfast. In 
addition, the differences in the specific constituents between high- and low-fat meals may differentially 
affect uptake and efflux transport of mirabegron from the gastrointestinal tract. The effect of food 
depends on the quantity of fat, and it is also different depending on the gender (women show a higher 
increase in bioavailability when the drug is taken with food).  
There were no apparent differences in the magnitude of the food effect between Western and Japanese 
healthy volunteers or between males and females. There were no food restrictions in the primary 
phase 3 studies; efficacy and safety of the proposed therapeutic dose of 50 mg was established in 
these studies with the administration of mirabegron with or without food. Mirabegron can be taken 
with or without food. 
Distribution 
Mirabegron has a large volume of distribution of approximately 1670 mL indicating extensive 
distribution. Mirabegron is moderately bound (approximately 71%) to human plasma proteins, 
including albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Small changes were observed in patients with mild, 
moderate or severe renal impairment and those observed for mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 24/130 
 
 
 
 
however, it is not probable that these changes have any clinical relevance considering the relative 
change and the high volume of distribution of mirabegron. 
Mirabegron distributes to red blood cells. However no clinical effect is expected even if the erythrocyte 
concentration decreases. The volume of distribution of mirabegron of around 1670 mL across studies 
indicates that mirabegron highly distributes in the organism. 
Elimination 
The excretion process is independent of dose or administration route and is not altered with repeated 
dosing. Part of the renal excretion is through active secretion.  
The total body clearance (CL) from plasma is estimated to be approximately 57 L/h. Blood clearance is 
estimated to be approximately 41 L/hr, which is about half the liver blood flow.  
Based on population PK analysis the effective half-life of mirabegron was determined to be 19.0 hours. 
This is shorter than the estimates for the terminal t1/2 obtained in the clinical mass balance study and 
the studies which use a prolonged sampling schedule suggesting that the terminal t1/2 comprises a 
small fraction of the total AUCinf. 
Renal clearance was decreased in subjects with renal impairment and in elderly subjects, in particular 
in elderly females, in comparison to the respective control groups, consistent with the generally lower 
renal capacity in these subjects. 
All circulating mirabegron metabolites represented a larger percentage of the parent exposure after 
oral administration of mirabegron compared to IV administration, suggesting that mirabegron 
undergoes intestinal and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism following oral administration. 
Metabolite-to-parent AUC ratios were relatively constant across multiple oral doses of 25 to 200 mg 
qd, indicating that the metabolism of mirabegron is not saturable over this dose range.  
No studies have been performed to determine whether differences in the pharmacogenetics regarding 
the UGT, and CYP enzymes other than CYP2D6 would have any effect on the metabolism of 
mirabegron. it is predicted from the urinary excretion data that the UGT system metabolizes 
approximately 10% of the absorbed drug dose. Of the 10 metabolites observed in human urine, 6 
metabolites were formed via glucuronidation, 3 primary (M11, M13 and M14) and 2 secondary 
glucuronides (M12 and M15) and one tertiary glucuronide (M17). An exploratory in vitro study with 
recombinant UGTs and a panel of human liver microsomes (correlation study) identified UGT2B7 as the 
primary UGT forming the major metabolite, M11, with limited contribution of UGT1A1, the UGT that 
has been associated with clinically relevant genotypic variations. Considering the unimodal distribution 
of the values of the ratios of the AUCs of M11 to parent (MRp) and the low percentage of mirabegron 
that could be metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyl-transferases it is unlikely that pharmacogenetic 
variation in UGTs or inhibitors or inducers of glucuronidation have a significant effect on mirabegron 
pharmacokinetics. 
The affinity of the metabolites detected in plasma for the beta-3-adrenoceptor was much smaller than 
that reported for mirabegron. Although no protein binding of the metabolites have been performed, 
considering the plasma concentrations and the affinity for the beta-3 adrenoceptor it is not likely that 
any of them contribute to the observed effect. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No deviations from dose proportionality in mirabegron PK parameters were observed after single-dose 
intravenous administration of mirabegron. After oral administration, a greater than dose-proportional 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 25/130 
 
 
 
 
increase in mirabegron Cmax and AUC was observed, due to an increase in absolute bioavailability with 
increasing dose. 
In the overall population of males and females, a 2-fold increase in dose increased mirabegron Cmax 
and AUCtau by approximately 2.9- and 2.6-fold, respectively, within the dose range of 25 mg to 200 
mg. Similar fold increases were obtained for males and females separately. Mirabegron metabolites 
also demonstrated a more than dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUCtau after multiple 
mirabegron doses (25 to 200 mg qd), similar to that observed with the parent compound, indicating 
that the greater than dose-proportional increase in mirabegron exposure is not caused by saturable 
first-pass metabolism. 
Steady state plasma concentrations were achieved within 7 days of once daily dosing with mirabegron. 
Comparison between AUCtau values following a single dose and at steady state indicated a 2-fold 
accumulation of mirabegron with once daily dosing. No time-dependency was observed at the 
proposed therapeutic dose of 50 mg. At doses of 100 mg and 200 mg, a small increase (less than 
20%) in AUCtau at steady state compared with single dose AUCinf was observed, suggesting that 
mirabegron may exhibit time-dependent PK at supratherapeutic doses. The changes are considered not 
clinically relevant. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function   
In patients with severe renal impairment there was an increase in Cmax and AUC; the increases were 
92% (90% CI: -3%, 281%) and 118% (90% CI: 30%, 267%), respectively compared to the values 
estimated for healthy volunteers. The suggested reduction of the dose to 25 mg once daily in patients 
with severe renal impairment or in those patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and 
concomitant administration of potent CYP3A inhibitors is accceptable.  
Impaired hepatic function 
In vitro and in vivo data suggested that mirabegron is cleared through multiple metabolic pathways 
and possibly biliary excretion of unchanged drug. 
Study 178-CL-039 an open-label, single-dose parallel group study was conducted to assess the single 
dose pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 100 mg of mirabegron in 32 male and female subjects 
with mild and moderate hepatic impairment in relation to healthy subjects. The results showed that 
Absorption of mirabegron was delayed in subjects with hepatic dysfunction compared to those with 
normal hepatic function. The t1/2 was increased in mildly impaired subjects to about 68 hours 
compared to 57 hours in healthy controls. A similar finding was not observed in subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment where the t1/2 was not substantially different from matched controls (mean 
values, 51 and 54 hours, respectively). No clear relationship was evident between individual Cmax and 
AUCinf values and the scores of the 5 parameters included in the Child-Pugh scale. In subjects with 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), mean mirabegron Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 
9% and 19% relative to volunteers with normal hepatic function. In volunteers with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), mean Cmax and AUCinf values were 175% and 65% higher.  
Gender

Mirabegron Cmax and AUCtau were approximately 44% to 38% higher, respectively, in females 
compared with males. The magnitude of the gender differences is attenuated with correction for body 
weight. Weight-normalized values for Cmax and AUCtau were approximately 23% and 18% higher in 
females compared to those in males. This remaining increased exposure is attributed to a higher 
absolute bioavailability of mirabegron in females compared to males. The t1/2 tended to be longer in 
females (mean values, 59.0 to 67.9 hr) compared with males (mean values, 56.3 to 60.0 hr).  
Race 
There are limited data regarding the influence of different ethnic origin on the pharmacokinetics of 
mirabegron However, results from the TQT study 178-CL-077 which included a similar number of 
White/Caucasian volunteers and Black or African American volunteers did not show an effect of race on 
the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron.  
Genetic polymorphism 
In spite of the low number of ultrarapid and poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, no dose adjustment appear 
to be necessary in poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, however AUC and Cmax in ultra-rapid metabolizers 
are reduced to half in intermediate and extended metabolizers. At doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg in 
Study 178-CL-077, mean AUCtau of mirabegron was approximately 30%, 43% and 9% lower, 
respectively, in volunteers with the UM phenotype compared to volunteers with the EM phenotype. 
Mean Cmax was approximately 30% and 47% lower, respectively, in volunteers with the UM 
phenotype compared to volunteers with the EM phenotype at doses of 50 and 100 mg, respectively, 
while for the 200 mg dose, mean Cmax values were similar. 
Elderly 
The effect of age on mirabegron pharmacokinetics was specifically evaluated in Study 178-CL-031. A 
Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, exploratory study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, 
safety and tolerability of multiple doses of mirabegron OCAS-M in healthy young male and female 
subjects and healthy elderly male and female subjects. No relevant differences were notable between 
the young and elderly groups apart from the age.  
No consistent differences in mirabegron Cmax and AUCtau were found in elderly versus young 
subjects. Terminal elimination half-life tended to be longer in elderly subjects (mean values, 60 to 68 
hours) compared with young subjects (mean values, 55 to 60 hours), but the differences were 
generally not more than a few hours.  
Population PK analysis of phase 2 and 3 data indicated that age affected mirabegron exposure. The 
typical AUC was predicted to be 11% higher in a subject aged 90 years compared to a typical OAB 
subject aged 60 years. Dose adjustment based on age is not necessary. 
Weight 
The magnitude of the observed mirabegron exposure differences between male and female volunteers 
and between Japanese and Western volunteers was attenuated with correction for body weight. 
Population PK analysis of phase 2 and 3 data confirmed that body weight affected mirabegron 
exposure. Relative to a subject with a body weight of 70 kg, AUCtau was about 53% higher in a 
subject with a body weight of 30 kg and approximately 17% lower in a subject with a body weight of 
100 kg. The increase in exposure with lower body weight is less than would be achieved if the dose 
were doubled (resulting in a 190% and 160% increase in Cmax and AUC, respectively). Given 
documented safety of mirabegron at a 100 mg dose (twice the proposed therapeutic dose), the effect 
of body weight on plasma exposure is considered not clinically significant. Dose adjustment based on 
body weight is not necessary. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 27/130 
 
 
 
 
The influence of weight (including other body size measures such as body mass index, lean body mass 
and height) has been investigated across a number of population PK analyses using data from healthy 
subjects and patients with OAB who received IR or OCAS formulations [178-PK-003, 178-PK-012, 178-
PK-015]. In the population PK analysis of phase 2 and 3 data [178-PK-015], a 10% increase in weight 
was found to increase mirabegron CL and central volume of distribution by 5%. Relative to a subject 
with a body weight of 70 kg, AUCtau increased by 52.8 % for a body weight of 30 kg and decreased by 
16.5% for a body weight of 100 kg. Dose adjustment based on body weight, according to this analysis 
is not necessary. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro data suggest that mirabegron is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, but also by CYP2D6 and UGT. 
CYP3A4 inhibitors reduce mirabegron metabolism. Studies of mirabegron using human liver 
microsomes and recombinant human CYP enzymes showed that mirabegron is a moderate and time-
dependent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Mirabegron inhibited P-gp-mediated 
drug transport at high concentrations. 
The coadministration of mirabegron with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors increases mirabegron plasma 
concentrations. Mean mirabegron Cmax and AUCinf values were increased when coadministered with 
ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) by 45% and 81%, respectively. However, these changes are 
not considered to have clinical relevance. Only when the mirabegron is coadministered with potent 
CYP3A inhibitor in patients with mildly impaired hepatic metabolism or mild / moderate renal 
impairment the concentrations of mirabegron increase in such a manner that a dose reduction from 50 
mg to 25 mg seems appropriate.  
Following coadministration of mirabegron with rifampin (CYP3A4 inductor) maximum concentration and 
AUC were decreased 35-40% with respect to the values obtained when mirabegron was administered 
alone. This reduction could be due to a decreased bioavailability of mirabegron through induction of 
intestinal and first-pass metabolism mediated by CYP and UGT enzymes. In addition, rifampin may 
have also induced intestinal P-gp efflux of mirabegron. The effect of rifampin on mirabegron exposure 
was generally greater in females than in males. No interaction with clinical relevance is likely between 
mirabegron and CYP3A4 inductors. 
No dose adjustment is claimed for mirabegron when coadministered with inhibitors of CYP2D6, 
although no study has been performed using this type of drugs, it is based on the fact that in vitro 
data indicates a minor involvement of CYP2D6 and the lack of changes in the pharmacokinetics of 
mirabegron in PMs for this isoenzyme.  
Two drug interaction studies were performed to investigate whether mirabegron inhibits cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 2D6 in vivo (160 mg immediate release [IR] once a day [qd], Study 178-CL-005; and 100 
mg OCAS qd, Study 178-CL-058). Coadministration of mirabegron with substrates of CYP2D6 
(desipramine and metoprolol) resulted in small modifications of the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron. 
However Cmax and AUC of desipramine and metoprolol were increased by 79% and 241% respectively 
when coadministered with mirabegron. It is taken into account that both drug-drug interaction studies 
investigated supratherapeutic doses of mirabegron. Drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates are not 
expected to require dose adjustment, except for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are 
significantly metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore a cautionary statement reflecting this is included into 
the SmPC.  
Considering the results obtained when co administering mirabegron with warfarin it is not likely an 
interaction between mirabegron and CYP2C9 substrates.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 28/130 
 
 
 
 
In order to establish that there is no risk to patients who may take mirabegron in combination with 
drugs that utilize the P-gp transporter, the effect of mirabegron on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, a 
known substrate for P-gp, was studied in healthy volunteers. In the presence of mirabegron, mean 
increases in digoxin AUClast and Cmax of 27% and 29% were observed after a single digoxin dose 
(0.25 mg). The same results were obtained in an exploratory analysis when subjects were included as 
random effects instead of fixed effects. The confidence intervals for the ratios for both AUClast and 
Cmax exceed the pre-specified interval of 0.80 – 1.25, thus a clinically relevant effect of mirabegron 
on digoxin pharmacokinetics cannot be excluded. Since there was a 28% difference in plasma 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) for mirabegron between males and females, the effect of sex on the 
interaction of mirabegron and digoxin was assessed. The ANOVA model which explored sex effects and 
treatment by sex interactions for ratios of AUClast or Cmax showed non-significant p-values for main 
effects of sex and for the interaction term. The potential for inhibition of P-gp by mirabegron is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The PD effects of mirabegron were investigated throughout the clinical development programme in 
healthy volunteers and patients with overactive bladder. Pharmacodynamic studies were conducted to 
explore the cardiovascular effects and intra-ocular pressure effects of mirabegron. In addition, 2 
Thorough QT (TQT) studies were conducted.  
Mechanism of action 
Mirabegron is a selective agonist for human beta 3-adrenoceptor (beta 3-AR) which is dominant in the 
human detrusor muscle. Activation of the beta-AR in the bladder trigone facilitates urine storage 
through flattening and lengthening of the bladder base. Mirabegron dose-dependently increased cyclic 
adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations in bladder tissues isolated from rats and 
showed a potent relaxant effect in isolated rat and human bladder strips pre-contracted with carbachol 
at low contraction tonus. It decreased the resting intravesical pressure in a rat model and in 
anesthetised rats; mirabegron decreased the frequency of rhythmic bladder contractions without 
affecting the force of the rhythmic bladder contractions. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The relationship between plasma concentrations of mirabegron and its effects on the overactive 
bladder have been shown in three different PK/PD analysis (178-PK-005, 178-PK-009 and 178-PK-
015). In the three analyses individual plasma exposure to mirabegron were obtained from a previously 
developed pharmacokinetic model (study 178-PK-015). In all of them an Emax model best fitted the 
relationship between mirabegron AUC and the number of micturitions with respect to the baseline level 
and the modification of the volume of urine voided (with respect to baseline level). In those analyses it 
was shown that mirabegron reduces the number of incontinent episodes, although the effect is not 
related to the degree of exposure to mirabegron. The primary pharmacology study in male patients (≥ 
45 years of age) with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) 
showed bladder relaxation with mirabegron during the filling phase and inhibition of the frequency of 
non-voiding activity, without impairing voiding efficiency. This study provides supportive evidence of 
the mechanism of action in patients. Further the endpoints in the phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, 
especially mean voided volume, demonstrate an effect on urine storage capacity. The CHMP 
acknowledges the data provided on the mechanism of action. However, the population where voiding

urodynamic measurements were performed is different from the overactive bladder population and the 
data do not demonstrate an unequivocal mechanism of action on the human bladder in vivo. Therefore 
the applicant was asked to develop a plan for studies to unequivocally elucidate the mechanism of 
action of mirabegron post authorisation. 
In healthy subjects mirabegron increased heart rate and reduced SV while CO remained essentially 
unchanged. Coadministration of propranolol or bisoprolol attenuated the mirabegron-stimulated 
decrease in SV. However, these two antagonists are not selective of beta3-AR and thus it is difficult to 
clarify whether the cardiac effects of mirabegron are mediate by beta 1, beta 2 or beta3-AR.  
Regarding the QTC, a PK/PD model was developed including an effect compartment, plus linear 
relationship between changes in QTc and plasma concentrations in the biophase to explore the 
predicted change in the QTc after the administration of 100 and 200 mg of mirabegron in males and 
females. The drug is able to produce a change higher than 5 msec at both doses, in females. 
Predictions have been performed for 50 mg doses in females, and in patients suffering from different 
degrees of renal or hepatic impairment. According to the model women are more sensitive to changes 
in the QTc than men at similar plasma concentrations. TQT results are discussed under Clinical Safety - 
Laboratory Findings - ECG.  
Even though the exposure of mirabegron depends on the age, renal impairment, hepatic impairment 
and coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, under no conditions did the upper 1-sided 95% 
confidence interval for the mean ddQTc interval exceed 10 msec. Maximal ddQTc intervals did not 
increase more than 30 msec in any virtual subject under any conditions. 95% of subjects had maximal 
QTc intervals less than 500 msec for all simulation groups, except for 75 year old females with mild 
renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment and taking ketoconazole who had maximal ddQTc values of 
500.4 msec (95th percentile). In conclusion mirabegron 50 mg dose does not raise safety concerns 
related to the potential QT prolongation when factors such as gender or age (which may influence the 
exposure to mirabegron) are considered under usual circumstances. 
The population PK/PD analyses found small mean effects of mirabegron exposure on blood pressure in 
patients with overactive bladder, restricted to males in the case of systolic blood pressure and to 
younger patients in the case of diastolic blood pressure. Simulations of SBP showed that for 50 and 
100 mg daily doses in male OAB patients, mean increases from baseline of 0.80 and 1.75 mmHg 
respectively could be expected at steady state. Simulations of DBP showed that for 50 and 100 mg 
daily doses in OAB patients aged 18 to 50 years, mean increases from baseline of 0.40 and 0.80 
mmHg respectively could be expected at steady state. Simulations performed to predict the effect of 
mirabegron on SBP or DB in women over 55 years in situations mimicking possible renal or hepatic 
impairment showed that there will be no clinically significant changes in SBP and DBP unless 
mirabegron is coadministered with potent CYP3A inhibitors. In that case mirabegron dose reduction to 
25 mg as labeled in the SmPC is reasonable. 
Pharmocodynamic drug interaction studies with tamusolin, metformin and warfarin show that that PD 
interactions are unlikely when administered together with mirabegron. Results from specific ocular 
safety assessments in phase 1 studies, including a study performed with a non-contact air-puff 
tonometer [178-CL-031], do not demonstrate an effect on IOP and do not show clinically significant 
changes in visual acuity or fundoscopy at mirabegron doses up to 400 mg as a single dose or 
300 mg/day as multiple doses over 10 consecutive days [178-CL-034]. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
After oral administration, a greater than dose-proportional increase in mirabegron Cmax and AUC was 
observed, due to an increase in absolute bioavailability with increasing dose. In the overall population 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 30/130 
 
 
 
 
of males and females, a 2-fold increase in dose increased mirabegron Cmax and AUCtau by 
approximately 2.9- and 2.6-fold, respectively, within the dose range of 25 mg to 200 mg. Similar fold 
increases were obtained for males and females separately. The applicant indicates that the target 
exposure range of mirabegron is based on the plasma exposure observed with mirabegron 50 mg and 
is bracketed by the exposure observed with the 2 doses on either side evaluated in the program, 
namely 25 mg and 100 mg. The definition of this range is based on the demonstrated efficacy within 
this range in the absence of dose-dependent safety signals when the dose is varied between 25 mg 
and 100 mg. This indicates that the degree of difference in mirabegron exposure caused by an intrinsic 
or extrinsic factor that is of no clinical consequence is a 2.6-fold change in AUC or a 2.9-fold change in 
Cmax in either direction. 
In vitro data suggest that mirabegron is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, but also by CYP2D6 and UGT. 
The coadministration of mirabegron with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors increases mirabegron plasma 
concentrations. Mean mirabegron Cmax and AUCinf values were increased when coadministered with 
ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) by 66% and 100%, respectively, in females. However, these 
changes are not considered to have clinical relevance.  
Coadministration of mirabegron with substrates of CYP2D6 (desipramine and metoprolol) resulted in 
small modifications of the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron. However Cmax and AUC of desipramine 
and metoprolol were increased around 2 and 3 fold respectively when coadministered with mirabegron. 
Therefore cautionary statements were included into the SmPC for the concomitant use of drugs with a 
narrow therapeutic index that are significantly metabolized by CYP2D6.  
With respect to Pg-P substrates, the interaction was studied with digoxin. Changes in the 
pharmacokinetics of digoxin were observed. Since digoxin is considered a narrow therapeutic index 
drug it was included into the SmPC that, for patients who are initiating a combination of mirabegron 
and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should be prescribed initially. Serum digoxin concentrations 
should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect. 
Following single dose administration of 100 mg mirabegron in volunteers with mild hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class A), mean mirabegron Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 9% and 19% relative to 
volunteers with normal hepatic function. In volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class B), mean Cmax and AUCinf values were 175% and 65% higher. A reduction of the dose to 25 mg 
once daily in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is recommended. Further the CHMP 
considered that also patients with mild hepatic impairment concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor could have mirabegron plasma exposure around or outside the acceptable upper boundary. 
Therefore, a dose reduction to 25 mg for patients with mild hepatic impairment concomitantly 
receiving strong CYP3A inihitors was included into the SmPC; use of mirabegron in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment who concomitantly receive strong CYP3A inihitors is not recommended 
according to the SmPC. 
Similarly patients with severe renal impairments showed an increase in Cmax and AUC superior to 
100% with respect to the values estimated for healthy volunteers. Therefore recommendation for 
reduction of the dose to 25 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment or in those patients 
with mild or moderate renal impairment if concomitantly receiving a potent CYP3A inhibitors was 
included into the SmPC. 
Regarding the QTC, a PK/PD model was developed. Even though the exposure of mirabegron depends 
on the age, renal impairment, hepatic impairment and coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, 
under no conditions did the upper 1-sided 95% confidence interval for the mean ddQTc interval exceed 
10 msec. Maximal ddQTc intervals did not increase more than 30 msec in any virtual subject under any 
conditions. 95% of subjects had maximal QTc intervals less than 500 msec for all simulation groups, 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 31/130 
 
 
 
 
except for 75 year old females with mild renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment and taking 
ketoconazole who had maximal ddQTc values of 500.4 msec (95th percentile). In conclusion 
mirabegron 50 mg dose does not raise safety concerns related to the potential QT prolongation when 
factors such as gender or age (which may influence the exposure to mirabegron) are considered under 
usual circumstances. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In terms of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions, mirabegron exposure increased when 
applied with CYP3A4 inhibitors and substrates of CYP2D6. Further with respect to interaction with Pg-P 
substrates, changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin were observed. Appropriate cautionary 
statements and, when applicable, dose reductions, were included into the SmPC. Although the 
available information on the mechanism of action is considered sufficient by the CHMP, the applicant is 
recommended to explore it further, particularly in light of the available clinical efficacy data. With 
regard to cardiovascular safety, the proposed dose does not raise safety concerns related to the 
potential QT prolongation when factors such as gender or age are considered; further data will be 
generated as detailed in the risk management plan (see clinical safety). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The efficacy of mirabegron in the treatment of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB), 
including urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency was evaluated in 9 studies, 
including: 
· 1 phase 2a proof-of-concept study (178-CL-008), 
· 2 supportive phase 2b studies (178-CL-045 and 178-CL-044), 
· 3 primary phase 3 studies (178-CL-046, 178-CL-047 and 178-CL-074), 
· 1 supportive phase 3 study (178-CL-048), 
· 1 phase 3 active-controlled long-term safety study (178-CL-049), and 
· 1 phase 3 open label, long-term safety study (178-CL-051). 
The phase 3 program evaluated doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg mirabegron orally once daily.

Quantitative symptoms were the basis for the preliminary assessment of the efficacy and the dose-
response relationship. Little differences in terms of effect appear to be between 25 and 200 mg 
dosages, showing a flat dose effect curve. OAB patients experienced a reduction of 1.9 (25 mg) to 2.2 
(200 mg) of daily micturitions and 1.2 to 1.3 (25-200 mg) of incontinence episodes. A similar pattern 
was followed by the other defining condition symptoms urgency and nocturia.  
From the safety point of view the selection of the dose for Phase III appears to be driven by the 
adverse beta-adrenergic effects, in which a clearer dose-effect relationship was determined. This effect 
is mainly apparent on heart rate. A dose-dependent pulse rate increase was observed, being significant 
over 100 mg.  
In conclusion, dose selection for Phase 3 was based on both tolerability and efficacy grounds, although 
the more clear relationship with the dose level is related to safety. As a consequence, mirabegron 200 
mg was no longer tested. Doses of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg were selected for confirmatory studies.  
2.5.2.  Main study(ies)   
Three pivotal Phase3 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group 12-week studies 
support the use of mirabegron 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg in the treatment of OAB (Studies CL-046, 
CL-047 and CL-074). Data from these three studies was integrated for pooled-analyses.

This was a phase III randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo- and active-controlled, 
multinational, multicenter study. A total of 189 sites in Europe and Australia enrolled patients for the 
study. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Male and female patients at least 18 years of age who had symptoms of OAB for more than 3 months 
were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had significant stress incontinence or mixed 
stress/urgency incontinence with stress as the predominant factor; an indwelling catheter; evidence of 
a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic inflammation, bladder stones, previous pelvic 
radiation therapy or previous or current malignant disease of the pelvic organs; or severe hypertension 
(defined as a sitting average systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or average diastolic 
blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 110 mm Hg). Additionally, patients were excluded if they practiced 
intermittent self-catheterization; received nondrug treatment including electro-stimulation therapy; or 
used medications intended to treat OAB, prohibited medications, or restricted medications without 
meeting conditions for use. 
At baseline patients had to have experienced a micturition frequency on average ≥ 8 times per 24-
hour period during the 3-day micturition diary period, experienced at least 3 episodes of urgency 
(grade 3 or 4) with or without incontinence during the 3-day micturition diary period and had to 
continue to meet all screening eligibility criteria. Patients were excluded if they had an average total 
daily urine volume > 3000 mL as recorded in the 3-day micturition diary period; they had serum 
creatinine of > 150 mcmol/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2 
times the upper limit of normal range or gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) > 3 times the upper limit 
of normal, as assessed in screening samples and considered clinically significant by the investigator; or 
severe hypertension (defined as a sitting average systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or 
average diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 110 mm Hg); or they had a clinically significant abnormal 
electrocardiogram (ECG).

In addition, 2 responder analyses based on incontinence episodes were performed at week 4, week 8, 
week 12 and Final Visit using the FAS-I data set. The 2 responder definitions were as follows: 
•  Zero incontinence episodes: A responder was defined as a subject with 0 incontinence episodes 
post-baseline 
•  Reduction in incontinence episodes: A responder was defined as a subject with a ≥ 50% 
decrease from baseline in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours 
Additional secondary efficacy variables which were not derived from the 3-day micturition diary were: 
•  Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in Symptom Bother and 
HRQL scores as assessed by the OAB-q questionnaire 
•  Change from baseline to week 12 and Final Visit in scores as assessed by the WPAI:SHP 
questionnaire 
•  Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in scores as assessed by the 
EQ-5D questionnaire 
•  Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in scores as assessed by the 
EQ-5D VAS questionnaire 
•  Change from baseline to week 12 and Final Visit in PPBC 
•  Change from baseline to week 12 and Final Visit in the TS-VAS 
•  Change from baseline to week 4, week 8, week 12 and Final Visit in number of physician visits 
for the subject’s bladder condition (excluding study-related visits) 
In addition, for change from baseline in PPBC, analyses were performed at week 12 and 
Final Visit based on the following improvement from baseline definitions: 
• 
Improvement: ≥ 1 point improvement from baseline 
•  Major improvement: ≥ 2 point improvement from baseline 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  of  pivotal  studies  was planned  to  provide  about  90% power  to  detect  a  reduction  of 
0.7  in  the  mean  number  of  micturitions  per  24  hours  over  placebo  in  the  mirabegron  group  at  a  2-
sided significance level of 0.05. Both mirabegron doses were compared with placebo by means of the 
Dunnett’s test, which takes into account multiplicity, and the sample size calculation was based on this 
test. The standard deviation of the primary efficacy variable was assumed to be 2.7.  
The  sample  size  calculation  for  the  mean  number  of  incontinence  episodes  was  based  on 
nonparametric  methods  since  the  results  of  Study  178-CL-044  indicated  that  the  assumption  of 
normality might not be valid.  
Only patients who were incontinent at baseline were included in the analysis of incontinence episodes. 
From  Study  178-CL-044,  it  was  estimated  that  this  constituted  about  65%  of  the  population.  The 
probability that a patient on mirabegron would respond better than a patient on placebo was 60.8%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 38/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since the 2 variables are positively correlated (Spearman rank correlation 0.31), the overall power is 
between 87% and 90%. A dropout rate of 20% during the placebo run-in period was assumed.  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized after all baseline assessments were performed and eligibility for 
randomization was established. Patient numbers and randomized treatment were allocated by the CIRT 
system. 
Patients who met the inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria at the end of the single-
blind, placebo run-in period, were randomized to 1 of the 4 treatment groups (mirabegron 50 mg, 
mirabegron 100 mg, placebo, or tolterodine SR 4 mg) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio using a computer-generated 
randomization scheme prepared by Pierrel Research Europe GmbH. Randomization was stratified by 
country. 
Blinding (masking) 
During the placebo run-in period, patients were blinded to the identity of study drug. During the 
double-blind treatment and follow-up periods, the investigator, study site personnel, patients, sponsor 
and the sponsor’s representatives were blinded to the identity of the randomized drug assignment. 
Statistical methods 
A full description of the planned statistical methodology was provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) which was finalised before the treatment codes were unblinded. The SAP included a number of 
changes made to the statistical methods described in the protocol. 
The following analysis sets were pre-specified: 
•  Run-in Period Analysis Set (RPAS): all patients who took at least one dose of the single-blind 
placebo run-in study drug; 
•  Randomized Analysis Set (RAS): all randomized patients; 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomized patients who took at least one dose of double-blind 
study drug and who had a micturition measurement in the baseline diary and at least one post-
baseline visit diary with a micturition measurement; 
FAS Incontinence (FAS-I): all FAS patients who had at least one incontinence episode at 
baseline; 
Per Protocol Set (PPS): FAS patients who did not deviate from the list of pre-specified major 
protocol violations; 
PPS Incontinence (PPS-I): All PPS patients who had at least one incontinence episode at 
baseline; 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: all randomized patients who took at least one dose of 
double-blind study drug and who had a baseline diary with micturition measurements; 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 39/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
ITT Incontinence (ITT-I) Analysis Set: all randomized patients who took at least one dose of 
double-blind study drug and who had micturition measurements and at least one incontinence 
episode in the baseline diary; 
•  Safety Analysis Set (SAF): all randomized patients who took at least one dose of double-blind 
study drug. 
As patients could be randomised without an incontinence episode in the baseline diary, a separate FAS 
definition based on micturition and incontinence episodes was defined as FAS-I. The populations for 
analyses of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and key secondary efficacy endpoints included the FAS 
and FAS-I. 
Two-co-primary efficacy variables, both based on a micturition diary completed by the patients on the 
3 study days immediately before visits at Weeks 4, 8 and 12, were defined as follows: 
•  Change from baseline to end of treatment (Final Visit) in mean number of micturition per 24 
hours; 
•  Change from baseline to end of treatment (Final Visit) in mean number of incontinence 
episodes per 24 hours. 
In addition three key secondary efficacy variables were: 
• 
• 
• 
change from baseline to end of treatment (Final Visit) in mean volume voided per micturition; 
change from baseline to Week 4 in mean number of micturition per 24 hours; 
change from baseline to Week 4 in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours. 
The additional secondary endpoints of Treatment Satisfaction Visual Analog Scale (TS-VAS), HRQL 
scores as assessed by the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q), and Patient Perception of 
Bladder Condition (PPBC) were used to collect and analyse subjective outcome measures. A responder 
analysis was specified for the reduction in incontinence episodes with a responder being defined as a 
patient that had at least a 50% decrease from baseline in the number of episodes per 24 hours. 
All statistical comparisons were made using two-sided tests at the 5% significance level and were 
testing the treatment difference compared with placebo. The primary comparisons for the co-primary 
and secondary efficacy variables were between each mirabegron group and placebo with a secondary 
comparison between tolterodine and placebo. No formal statistical testing was performed to assess the 
difference between the mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups or between each mirabegron group and 
the tolterodine group. 
Missing data for the Final Visit were handled using last observation carried forward (LOCF) methods. All 
efficacy analyses using Final Visit included data that were measured within 7 days of the last dose of 
study drug. For all efficacy analyses, to be included in an analysis at a specific time-point the patient 
needed to have a measurement at that time-point; therefore no values were imputed. 
Since there were two co-primary efficacy variables and 3 key secondary efficacy variables, the 
multiplicity between the variables was controlled at the Type I error rate at the 5% significance level 
using a stepwise parallel gate-keeping procedure, a hierarchical testing procedure. At each of the five

stages, the difference between a mirabegron dose group and placebo had to be statistically significant 
before that mirabegron dose group proceeded to the next stage. The stages and efficacy variables that 
were evaluated were as follows: 
•  Stage 1: incontinence episodes at the Final Visit 
•  Stage 2: micturition at the Final Visit 
•  Stage 3: volume voided per micturition at the Final Visit 
•  Stage 4: incontinence episodes at week 4 
•  Stage 5: micturition at week 4 
Since two mirabegron treatment groups were compared with placebo, the Hochberg procedure was 
performed at the 5% significance level to adjust for multiplicity within each stage described above. If 
only one of the mirabegron dose groups proceeded to the next stage for any efficacy variable, then the 
comparison between mirabegron and placebo was assessed at the 2.5% significance level. Since the 
comparison between tolterodine and placebo was a secondary analysis, no adjustment for multiplicity 
was necessary. 
The stratified rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for hypothesis testing and calculating 
the pair-wise p-values. The least squares mean estimates and two-sided 95% CIs for mean changes 
from baseline within treatment group, as well as the mean change from baseline in the difference 
between each mirabegron treatment group and placebo and between tolterodine and placebo, were 
derived from the corresponding ANCOVA model with all treatment groups in the model. 
Change from baseline to Final Visit (co-primary efficacy variable) and to Week 4 (key secondary 
efficacy variable) in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was analysed using a 
separate stratified rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for each pair-wise treatment group difference 
of interest. The response variable was standardised ranks on change from baseline to Final Visit value 
for the stratified rank ANCOVA with baseline standardised ranks and gender as covariates and 
geographical region as a stratum. 
Change from baseline to Final Visit (co-primary efficacy variable) and to Week 4 (key secondary 
efficacy variable) in mean number of micturition per 24 hours was analysed using an ANCOVA including 
treatment, gender and geographical region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate. This ANCOVA 
model also was used to analyse the change from baseline to Final Visit in mean volume voided per 
micturition. Within the framework of this ANCOVA model, point estimates and two-sided 95% CIs for 
the mean change from baseline within each treatment group, as well as for the difference in mean 
change from baseline between each mirabegron treatment group and placebo and between tolterodine 
and placebo, were calculated. 
To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis, the modelling of the co-primary efficacy 
variables was repeated using various sensitivity analyses using repeated measures methodology. 
These sensitivity analyses included investigation of outliers and where appropriate additional analyses 
were planned excluding outliers. An outlier was defined as an observation for which the residual is 
more than three interquartile ranges above the 75th percentile or below the 25th percentile.  
The co-primary efficacy variables were also analysed for the following subgroups: race, age, gender 
and geographical region.

Conduct of the study 
Reasons for exclusion of patients from the PPS and PPS-I comprised major protocol violations that 
affected the co-primary efficacy variables and the key secondary efficacy variable of volume voided per 
micturition. These included eligibility criteria that were not met, administration of incorrect study drug, 
poor study drug compliance (defined as < 70% of study taken during the double-blind treatment 
period), inadequate duration of treatment during the placebo run-in period or double-blind treatment 
period (defined as < 53 days recorded for the last diary day of the Final Visit), use of prohibited 
concomitant medication during the placebo run-in period or the double-blind treatment period, and 
unblinding of treatment for double-blind study drug. Approximately 11% of patients in the FAS and 
12% of patients in the FAS-I were excluded from the PPS and PPS-I, respectively. The percentage of 
patients excluded from the PPS and PPS-I was comparable across all treatment groups. The most 
frequently cited reason for exclusion reflected an inadequate duration of treatment during the double-
blind treatment period (i.e., the last diary day of the Final Visit was < 53 days); the percentage of 
patients excluded for this reason for the PPS and PPS-I was 3.8% and 4.1% for the placebo group, 
6.1% and 6.5% for the mirabegron 50 mg group, 4.2% and 4.3% for the mirabegron 100 mg group 
and 3.8% and 3.0% for the tolterodine SR 4 mg group 
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were consistent across treatment groups for patients in the 
SAF population. Overall, 72.2% of patients were female. The majority (62.9%) of patients were < 65 
years of age and 91.3% were < 75 years of age. Overall, 99.1% of patients were white. Mean body 
mass index across all treatment groups was 27.8 kg/m2. Demographic and baseline characteristics 
were similar across treatment groups in the FAS and FAS-I. 72.0% and 83.4% of patients were female 
(FAS and FAS-I, respectively). In the FAS, mean age was 59.1 years and 37.1% of patients were ≥ 65 
years of age. The overall mean duration of OAB symptoms was 79.3 and 88.0 months in the FAS and 
FAS-I, respectively. Overall, approximately one-half of patients had received previous OAB 
antimuscarinic therapy (49.6% and 56.5% in the FAS and FAS-I, respectively).

Approximately 60% of patients in the FAS in each treatment group had 1 or more episodes of 
incontinence during the 3-day diary period at baseline. Mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups 
demonstrated statistically significant greater reductions from baseline to Final Visit compared to 
placebo in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours (difference from placebo: -0.41 
and -0.29, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg). The reduction in the mean number of 
incontinence episodes per 24 hours (difference from placebo: -0.10) as compared to placebo for the 
tolterodine SR 4 mg group was not statistically significant. 
Change from Baseline to Final Visit in Mean Number of Micturition per 24 hours 
Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the reduction from baseline 
to Final Visit in mean number of micturition per 24 hours compared to placebo with the multiplicity 
adjustment. The magnitude of reduction in the mirabegron 100 mg group was lower than that 
observed in the mirabegron 50 mg group. The adjusted mean difference versus placebo for the 
tolterodine SR 4 mg group (-0.25) was not statistically significant.

Key Secondary endpoints  
After 12 weeks of treatment patients receiving mirabegron experienced a statistically significant 
reduction in the number of micturitions and the incontinence episodes. This positive effect was also 
translated into the main secondary endpoints. In general, effect size is deemed as modest. Doses of 
50 mg and 100 mg do not separate from each other in terms of efficacy. Exploratory comparison 
between mirabegron and tolterodine showed numerical differences in favour of mirabegron.

-  Repeated Measurement Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, FAS 
In the repeated measurement analysis of the mean number of micturition per 24 hours, the adjusted 
mean difference versus placebo and 95% CIs for both mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups at week 
12 were similar to those at the Final Visit in the primary analysis. Both mirabegron groups 
demonstrated statistically significantly superior mean reduction of micturition compared to the placebo 
group as early as week 4 and their effectiveness was maintained throughout the treatment period 
(weeks 8 and 12). The P-values at week 12 from the repeated measurement analysis were P< 0.001 
for the mirabegron 50 mg and P=0.006 for the mirabegron 100 mg group. Tolterodine SR 4 mg 
demonstrated a statistically significantly superior mean reduction of micturition compared to placebo at 
the week 4 and week 8 time points. 
- 
Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hour, PPS-I 
In the PPS-I, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of incontinence episodes per 
24 hours from baseline to Final Visit was -0.40 in the mirabegron 50 mg group and -0.29 in the 
mirabegron 100 mg group. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in 
the reduction from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the mean number of incontinence 
episodes per 24 hours]. In the PPS-I, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of 
incontinence episodes per 24 hours from baseline to Final Visit was -0.17 in the tolterodine SR 4 mg 
group, this was not statistically significant.  
- 
Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, PPS 
One of the inclusion criteria was a mean of ≥ 8 micturition per 24 hours at baseline. The sensitivity 
analyses in the PPS excluded patients who did not meet this criterion at baseline. In this sensitivity 
analysis, the adjusted mean differences versus placebo in the number of micturition per 24 hours were 
-0.71 and -0.50 for the mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively. Each mirabegron group 
demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the reduction from baseline to Final Visit compared 
to placebo in the mean number of micturition per 24 hours (see table below). The adjusted mean 
differences versus placebo in the number of micturition per 24 hours were -0.40 for the tolterodine SR 
4 mg group. This was statistically significant.  
Responder Analysis  
Reduction in Incontinence Episodes 
At the Final Visit, the percentage of responders was greater in the mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 
mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg groups than in the placebo group. The difference versus placebo was 
11.9%, 7.5% and 8.2% for the mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg 
groups. The corresponding odds ratio for mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 
mg was 1.75, 1.45 and 1.44, respectively; statistical significance was achieved for all 3 active 
treatment groups  
Zero Incontinence Episodes 
The percentage of responders for zero incontinence episodes was greater in the active treatment 
groups than in placebo and the difference versus placebo in all active treatment groups at the Final 
visit was 4.5%, 3.2% and 6.8% for mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine SR 4 mg.

Conduct of the study 
Five patients were identified as having been enrolled into the study twice. Enrolment occurred at 10 
unique sites for these patients. One patient was a screen failure at 1 site and a run-in failure at a 
different site and the other 4 patients were randomized twice and received 2 double-blind study drug 
treatment assignments. These 4 patients were therefore analyzed as 8 unique patients for both 
efficacy and safety.

Reasons for exclusion of patients from the PPS and PPS-I comprised major protocol violations that 
affected the co-primary efficacy variables and the key secondary efficacy variable of volume voided per 
micturition. These included eligibility criteria that were not met, administration of incorrect study drug, 
poor study drug compliance (defined as < 70% during the double-blind treatment period) and 
inadequate duration of treatment. For the placebo run-in period, inadequate duration of treatment was 
defined as placebo treatment < 9 days during the placebo run-in period until the last diary day before 
randomization. For the double-blind treatment period, inadequate duration of treatment was defined as 
last diary day of the Final Visit 3-day micturition diary < 53 days during the double-blind treatment 
period. 
Approximately 12% of patients in the FAS and 11% of patients in the FAS-I were excluded from the 
PPS and PPS-I, respectively. In all treatment groups, the most frequently cited reason for exclusion 
reflected an inadequate duration of treatment during the double-blind treatment period (i.e., last diary 
day of the Final Visit was < 53 days); the percentage of patients excluded for this reason for the PPS 
and PPS-I was 6.5% in the placebo group (for both the PPS and PPS-I), 6.4% and 7.7% in the 
mirabegron 50 mg group and 3.4% and 3.7% in the mirabegron 100 mg group. 
Baseline data 
Generally, demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups. Overall, 
approximately 75% and 82% of patients were female in the FAS and FAS-I, respectively. In the FAS, 
the mean age was 60.2 years and 39.7% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age. The overall mean 
duration of OAB symptoms was approximately 90 months in the FAS and FAS-I. The majority of 
patients had received previous OAB antimuscarinic therapy (approximately 56% and 60% in the FAS 
and FAS-I, respectively). Approximately 65% of patients in both analysis sets who had received 
previous OAB antimuscarinic therapy cited insufficient effect as a reason for discontinuation, while poor 
tolerability was cited by approximately 22% of these patients.

Key Secondary Endpoints  
For the key secondary efficacy endpoints, the mirabegron 50 and 100 mg groups showed statistically 
significantly greater increases from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in mean volume 
voided per micturition, statistically significantly greater reductions from baseline to week 4 (the first 
measured time point) compared with placebo in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours 
and the mean number of micturition per 24 hours.  
Additional secondary endpoints  
The mirabegron 50 and 100 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements 
from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in mean level of urgency, mean number of urgency 
incontinence episodes and mean number of episodes of urgency grade 3 or 4. For the subjective 
improvement assessments, mirabegron 50 and 100 mg demonstrated statistically significant 
improvement from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in TS-VAS, PPBC, mean number of 
pads used per 24 hours, the Symptom Bother Score and HRQL Total Score.

- 
Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hour, PPS-I 
In the PPS-I, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of incontinence episodes per 
24 hours from baseline to the Final Visit was -0.33 in the mirabegron 50 mg group and -0.53 in the 
mirabegron 100 mg group. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in 
the reduction from baseline to Final Visit compared to placebo in the mean number of incontinence 
episodes per 24 hours. 
- 
Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, PPS 
One of the inclusion criteria was a mean of ≥ 8 micturition per 24 hours at baseline. The sensitivity 
analyses in the PPS excluded patients who did not meet this criterion at baseline. In this sensitivity 
analysis, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of micturition per 24 hours was -
0.74 and -0.82 for the mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively. Each mirabegron group 
demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the reduction from baseline to Final Visit compared 
to placebo in the mean number of micturition per 24 hours. 
Responder Analysis 
Reduction in Incontinence Episodes 
At the Final Visit, the percentage of responders was greater in the mirabegron 50 mg (66.7%) and 100 
mg (73.3%) groups than in placebo (59.4%). The difference versus placebo was 7.3% for the 
mirabegron 50 mg group and 13.9% for the mirabegron 100 mg group. Statistically significant 
differences compared to placebo were demonstrated for the mirabegron 100 mg group. 
Zero Incontinence Episodes 
At the Final Visit, the percentage of zero incontinence responders was greater in the mirabegron 50 mg 
(40.7%) and 100 mg (49.0%) groups than in placebo (33.8%). The difference versus placebo was 
6.9% for the mirabegron 50 mg group and 15.1% for the mirabegron 100 mg group. Statistical

interval  (QTc)  prolongation,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  urinary  retention/acute  urinary  retention, 
hypersensitivity  type  events,  syncope  type  events,  seizure  type  events,  hepatic  type  events 
and renal and urinary events); Clinical laboratory evaluations (i.e., haematology, biochemistry, 
urinalysis  and  thyroid  analytes);  Vital  signs  (sitting  SBP,  sitting  DBP  and  pulse  rate);  ECGs; 
Post-void residual volume (PVR) and physical examination

Randomisation 
After screening (day -21 to day -14), patients were enrolled in a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in 
period that ended at baseline (week 0). At baseline, patients meeting inclusion criteria and not meeting 
exclusion criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive mirabegron 25 mg, mirabegron 50 
mg or a matching placebo qd for a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period that 
consisted of visits at weeks 4, 8 and 12 and a 2 week follow-up telephone visit at the end of treatment.  
Blinding (masking) 
During the placebo run-in period, patients were blinded to the identity of study drug. During the 
double-blind treatment and follow-up periods, the investigator, study site personnel, patients, sponsor 
and the sponsor’s representatives were blinded to the identity of the randomized drug assignment. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods used were essentially the same as used in Study 178-CL-046. However there 
were three additional key secondary efficacy endpoints: mean level of urgency, mean number of 
urgency incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and mean number of urgency episodes [grade 3 or 4] per 
24 hours. These were also included in Studies 178-CL-046 and 178-CL-047 but were considered 
additional secondary endpoints and were not included in the hierarchical testing procedure for multiple 
endpoints.  
Urgency endpoints were based upon the 5-point Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale 
(PPIUS). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 2201 patients were screened, 2060 patients entered the placebo run-in period, 2030 patients 
took placebo run-in study drug, 1306 patients were randomized into the study, and 1305 patients 
received study drug.

Recruitment 
First Subject Enrolled – Last Subject Last Visit: 28 April 2009 - 27 April 2010 
Conduct of the study 
19 patients (7 patients, 4 patients and 8 patients in the placebo, mirabegron 25 mg and mirabegron 50 
mg groups, respectively) were discontinued due to taking medication that was considered exclusionary 
by the medical monitor. This circumstance occurred due to a more comprehensive application of the 
exclusion criterion with respect to concomitant medications by an interim medical monitor in the US 
during the study. The criterion was applied too broadly and not as intended per the protocol. 
Consequently, a number of medications (including CYP2D6 substrates) were disallowed that should not 
have been disallowed, which led to discontinuation of these patients from the study. The decision was 
reversed for future patients; however, the patients that were withdrawn from the study for this reason 
were not allowed to re-enrol. Additionally, 5 randomized patients were discontinued from the study 
due to protocol violations related to restricted or prohibited medications. 
Nine patients were identified as having either been enrolled twice in 178-CL-074 (1 patient) or enrolled 
in other mirabegron studies in addition to 178-CL-074 (8 patients). Enrolment in previous mirabegron 
studies was an exclusion criterion in the protocol. These subjects were excluded from the PPS and PPS-
I. 
• 
• 
• 
Three of the 9 patients were screening or run-in failures in 178-CL-074 and were not 
randomized into the study. 
Two of the 9 patients received mirabegron in 178-CL-074 and had not received double-blind 
study medication during the previous enrolment (1 patient was previously a run-in failure at a 
different site in 178-CL-074 and the other patient was randomized in 178-CL-047 but never 
received study medication). 
Two patients received study medication in other mirabegron studies but had no overlap in 
double-blind treatment during 178-CL-074. 
•  One patient received study medication in 2 additional mirabegron studies (178-CL- 047 and 
178-CL-049) and had an approximately 3-month overlap in double-blind treatment during 178-
CL-074. 
•  One patient received mirabegron in 178-CL-074 and received placebo treatment in study 178-
CL-008. The patient completed study 178-CL-008. 
Reasons for exclusion of patients from the PPS and PPS-I comprised major protocol violations that 
affected the co-primary efficacy variables and the key secondary efficacy variable of mean volume 
voided per micturition. These included eligibility criteria that were not met, administration of incorrect 
study drug, poor study drug compliance (defined as < 70% during the double-blind treatment period), 
inadequate duration of treatment, unblinding of study drug, use of prohibited or restricted concomitant 
medication and participation in a previous mirabegron study. For the placebo run-in period, inadequate 
duration of treatment was defined as placebo treatment < 9 days until the last diary day before 
randomization. For the double-blind treatment period, inadequate duration of treatment was defined as 
last diary day of the final visit 3-day micturition diary < 53 days. Approximately 9% of patients in the 
FAS and 10% of patients in the FAS-I were excluded from the PPS and PPS-I, respectively.

Baseline data 
Generally, demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups in the FAS 
and FAS-I. Overall, approximately 69% and 80% of patients were female in the FAS and FAS-I, 
respectively. The higher proportion of female patients was the most apparent difference in 
demographics and baseline characteristics observed between the FAS and FAS-I populations. In the 
FAS, mean age was 59.1 years and 37.2% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age. The overall mean 
duration of OAB symptoms was approximately 94 months in the FAS and 100 months in the FAS-I. 
More than half of the patients had received previous OAB antimuscarinic therapy (approximately 51% 
and 58% in the FAS and FAS-I, respectively). Approximately 67% of patients in the FAS and 66% of 
patients in the FAS-I analysis sets who had received previous OAB antimuscarinic therapy cited 
insufficient effect as a reason for discontinuation, while approximately 26% of patients in the FAS and 
28% of patients in the FAS-I cited poor tolerability.

EMA/706651/2012 
Page 63/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Baseline characteristics are reasonable similar across the treatment groups. Majority of the subjects 
included were female and less than 65 years of age. The proportion of males included in this study is 
less than included in studies 178-CL-046 and 178-CL-047. 
Numbers analysed 
The percentage of patients randomised who had reported at least one episode of incontinence in the 
baseline diary is approximately 60%, fairly similar in each of the treatment groups.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 64/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the co-primary efficacy endpoints, the mirabegron 25 and 50 mg groups demonstrated statistically 
significantly greater reductions from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in mean number of 
incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean number of micturition per 24 hours. 
Key Secondary endpoints  
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 65/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the key secondary efficacy endpoints, the mirabegron 50 mg group in the FAS showed statistically 
significantly greater increases from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in mean volume 
voided per micturition; mirabegron 25 mg was not statistically significant compared with placebo. 
Since the mirabegron 25 mg group did not meet significance for mean volume voided with multiplicity 
adjustment, subsequent key secondary endpoints for the mirabegron 25 mg group were excluded from 
further hypothesis testing as part of the gate-keeping procedure. Subsequent key secondary endpoints 
for the mirabegron 50 mg group were evaluated at the 0.025 significance level. 
The mirabegron 50 mg group had a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline to week 4 
(the first measured time point) compared with placebo in mean number of incontinence episodes per 
24 hours. The mirabegron 50 mg group did not have a statistically significantly greater reduction from 
baseline to week 4 compared with placebo in mean number of micturition per 24 hours. For all other 
key secondary efficacy endpoints, statistical significance was not achieved for either mirabegron 
treatment group due to the gate-keeping procedure which precluded further statistical testing on 
subsequent endpoints in the hierarchy once a dose group failed to reach statistical significance for an 
efficacy variable.

Additional secondary endpoints  
For the subjective improvement assessments, mirabegron 25 mg demonstrated statistically significant 
improvement in change from baseline to final visit in TS-VAS. Mirabegron 25 mg did not demonstrate 
statistically significant improvement in change from baseline to final visit in Symptom Bother Score, 
HRQL Total Score, PPBC, or mean number of pads used per 24 hours. Mirabegron 50 mg demonstrated 
statistically significant improvement in change from baseline to final visit in TS-VAS and in Symptom 
Bother Score, but not in HRQL Total Score, PPBC, or mean number of pads used per 24 hours.  
Ancillary analyses 
-  Repeated Measurement Analysis of Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hours, FAS-I 
In the repeated measurement analysis of the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, the 
adjusted mean change from baseline to week 12 for the placebo group was greater than that at the 
final visit in the primary analysis. Therefore, although the adjusted mean change (and 95% CI) from 
baseline to week 12 for the mirabegron groups in the repeated measurement analysis were similar to 
those at final visit in the primary analysis, the adjusted mean differences versus placebo for both 
mirabegron groups (mirabegron 25 mg: -0.32 [0.169]; mirabegron 50 mg: -0.37 [0.169]) were 
slightly smaller compared to the primary analysis (mirabegron 25 mg: -0.40 [0.174]; mirabegron 50 
mg: -0.42 [0.173]). In the repeated measurement analysis, the reduction in the mean number of 
incontinence episodes was statistically significantly greater in mirabegron 25 mg group compared to 
placebo at week 4 (P = 0.048) and week 8 (P = 0.014) and approached statistical significance at week 
12 (P = 0.058). The mirabegron 50 mg group demonstrated statistically significant reduction in the 
mean number of incontinence episodes compared to placebo at weeks 4, 8 and 12 (P-values of 0.003, 
0.016 and 0.030, respectively). 
-  Repeated Measurement Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, FAS 
In the repeated measurement analysis of the mean number of micturition per 24 hours, the adjusted 
mean change from baseline to week 12 for the placebo group was greater than that at the final visit in 
the primary analysis. Therefore, although the adjusted mean change (and 95% CI) from baseline to 
week 12 for the mirabegron groups in the repeated measurement analysis were similar to those at 
final visit in the primary analysis, the adjusted mean differences versus placebo for both mirabegron 
groups (mirabegron 25 mg: -0.35 [0.171]; mirabegron 50 mg: -0.32 [0.171]) were slightly smaller 
compared to the primary analysis mirabegron 25 mg: -0.47 [0.176]; mirabegron 50 mg: -0.42 
[0.174]). In the repeated measurement analysis, the mirabegron 25 mg group demonstrated 
statistically significant reductions in the mean number of micturition compared to the placebo group at 
weeks 8 and 12 (P-values of 0.004 and 0.042, respectively). The reduction in the mean number of 
micturition was statistically significantly greater in the mirabegron 50 mg group compared to placebo 
at week 4 (P = 0.032) and week 8 (P = 0.006) and approached statistical significance at week 12 (P = 
0.063).

Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012 
Page 67/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the PPS-I, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of incontinence episodes per 
24 hours from baseline to the final visit was -0.32 and -0.39 in the mirabegron 25 mg and 50 mg 
groups, respectively. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the 
reduction from baseline to final visit compared to placebo in the mean number of incontinence 
episodes per 24 hours. 
- 
Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Number of Micturition per 24 Hours, PPS 
In this sensitivity analysis, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo in the number of micturition 
per 24 hours was -0.34 and -0.31 for the mirabegron 25 mg and 50 mg groups, respectively. 
Compared to placebo, the reduction from baseline to final visit in the mean number of micturition per 
24 hours for both mirabegron groups approached statistical significance [Table 19]. 
-  Other Sensitivity Analyses 
The results of all other sensitivity analyses were consistent with those presented for the primary 
analyses of the co-primary efficacy variables.

§ Since the mirabegron 25 mg group did not meet statistical significance with multiplicity adjustment for 
mean volume voided per micturition (P = 0.15), subsequent key secondary efficacy endpoints for the 
mirabegron 25 mg group were excluded from further hypothesis testing as part of the gatekeeping 
procedure. Mean volume voided per micturition and subsequent key secondary efficacy endpoints for the 
mirabegron 50 mg group were evaluated at the 0.025 significance level. Mirabegron 50 mg was statistically 
significantly superior compared with placebo at the 0.025 level. 
* Statistically significantly superior compared with placebo at the 0.05 level with multiplicity adjustment. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Primary Studies 178-CL-046, 178-CL-047 and 178-CL-074 were pooled for analyses of all primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints. Methods for multiplicity adjustment for the pooled analyses are based on 
those established in the SAPs for Studies 178-CL-046, 178-CL-047 and 178-CL-074.  
A stepwise parallel gatekeeping procedure was performed to control the Type I error rate at the 0.05 
significance level for the coprimary efficacy endpoints of 1) change from baseline to final visit in mean 
number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and 2) change from baseline to final visit in mean 
number micturitions of per 24 hours; and the key secondary efficacy endpoints of 3) change from 
baseline to final visit in mean volume voided per micturition, 4) change from baseline to week 4 in 
mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, 5) change from baseline to week 4 in mean 
number of micturitions per 24 hours, 6) change from baseline to final visit in mean level of urgency, 7) 
change from baseline to final visit in mean number of urgency incontinence episodes per 24 hours and 
8) change from baseline to final visit in mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 or 4) per 24 hours.  
Statistical testing was performed in 8 stages, evaluating the primary and key secondary endpoints in 
the order indicated above. In each stage the endpoint was evaluated and the difference between a 
mirabegron dose group and placebo must have been statistically significant before that mirabegron 
dose group proceeded to the next stage.

• 
Incontinence 
All mirabegron treatment groups in the 12-week phase 3 primary studies demonstrated a statistically 
significant reduction in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours at final visit compared 
with placebo with multiplicity adjustment. While no study required incontinence at baseline, inclusion in 
the FAS-I required at least one episode of incontinence in the 3-day baseline micturition diary 
(equating to a minimum of 0.33 episodes per 24 hours). 
The mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours at baseline was comparable across all 
treatment groups in the pooled primary studies. The adjusted mean changes from baseline to final visit 
were -1.10, -1.49 and -1.50 for the placebo, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg groups, 
respectively [Figure 1]. The adjusted mean differences versus placebo were -0.40 (mirabegron 50 mg) 
and -0.41 (mirabegron 100 mg). Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant 
reduction from baseline to final visit in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours compared 
with placebo with multiplicity adjustment. 
Both mirabegron 50 and 100 mg demonstrated a statistically significantly superior mean reduction of 
incontinence episodes compared with the placebo group as early as week 4 (the first measured time 
point), and their effectiveness was maintained throughout the treatment period (weeks 8 and 12).

•  Frequency 
All mirabegron treatment groups in the 12-week phase 3 primary studies demonstrated a statistically 
significant reduction in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours compared with placebo with 
multiplicity adjustment [Figure 4]. 
The mean number of micturitions per 24 hours at baseline was comparable across all treatment groups 
in the pooled primary studies. The adjusted mean changes from baseline to final visit were -1.20, -
1.75 and -1.74 for the placebo, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg groups, respectively. The 
adjusted mean differences versus placebo were -0.55 (mirabegron 50 mg) and -0.54 (mirabegron 100 
mg). Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline to final 
visit in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours compared with placebo with multiplicity adjustment. 
Both mirabegron 50 and 100 mg demonstrated a statistically significantly superior mean reduction in 
micturitions per 24 hours compared with the placebo group as early as week 4 (the first measured 
time point) and their effectiveness was maintained throughout the treatment period (weeks 8 and 12). 
A post-hoc evaluation of responders for reduction in micturitions (≤ 8 for mean number of micturition 
per 24 hours at final visit) has been carried out in the pooled analysis of primary efficacy studies.  
† 95% CIs for the difference of the proportions were based on normal approximation. 
‡  Odds  ratios  of  mirabegron  over  placebo,  corresponding  95%  CIs  and  P  values  were  derived  from  a  logistic 
regression model including treatment group, gender, study and baseline measurement.

* Statistically significantly superior compared with placebo at the 0.05 level without multiplicity adjustment. 
•  Mean Volume Voided per Micturition 
All mirabegron 50 and 100 mg treatment groups in the 12-week phase 3 primary studies demonstrated 
a statistically significant increase from baseline in mean volume voided per micturition compared with 
placebo with multiplicity adjustment [Figure 7]. 
The mean volume voided per micturition at baseline was comparable across all treatment groups in the 
pooled primary studies. The adjusted mean changes from baseline to final visit were 9.4, 21.4 and 
21.7 mL for the placebo, mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively. The adjusted mean 
differences versus placebo were 11.9 mL (mirabegron 50 mg) and 12.3 mL (mirabegron 100 mg). Each 
mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline to final visit in mean 
volume voided per micturition compared with placebo with multiplicity adjustment. 
Both mirabegron 50 and 100 mg demonstrated a statistically significantly superior increase in mean 
volume voided per micturition compared with the placebo group as early as week 4 (the first measured 
time point) and their effectiveness was maintained throughout the treatment period (weeks 8 and 12). 
•  Urgency 
All mirabegron treatment groups in the 12-week phase 3 primary studies demonstrated a reduction in 
mean level of urgency, the mean number of urgency incontinence episodes and the mean number of 
episodes with urgency grade 3 o 4 compared with placebo.  
The mean level of urgency at baseline was comparable across all treatment groups in the pooled 
primary studies. The adjusted mean changes from baseline to final visit were -0.15, -0.26 and -0.26 
for the placebo, mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively. The adjusted mean differences 
versus placebo were -0.11 (mirabegron 50 mg) and -0.11 (mirabegron 100 mg) for mean level of 
urgency. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline to 
final visit in the mean level of urgency compared with placebo with multiplicity adjustment. 
The mean number of urgency incontinence episodes at baseline was comparable across all treatment 
groups in the pooled primary studies. The adjusted mean changes from baseline to final visit were -
0.98, -1.38 and -1.38 for the placebo, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg groups, 
respectively. The adjusted mean differences versus placebo were -0.40 (mirabegron 50 mg) and -0.40

(mirabegron 100 mg). Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from 
baseline to final visit in mean number of urgency incontinence episodes per 24 hours compared with 
placebo. 
The mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours at baseline was comparable across all treatment 
groups in the pooled primary studies. The adjusted mean changes from baseline to final visit were -
1.29, -1.93 and -1.89 for the placebo, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg groups, 
respectively. The adjusted mean differences versus placebo were -0.64 (mirabegron 50 mg) and -0.60 
(mirabegron 100 mg). Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in 
reduction from baseline to final visit in mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 or 4) per 24 hours 
compared with placebo with multiplicity adjustment. 
•  Nocturia 
The mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours at baseline was comparable across all treatment 
groups in the pooled primary studies. The adjusted mean changes from baseline to final visit were -
0.42, -0.55 and -0.54 for the placebo, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg groups, 
respectively. The adjusted mean differences versus placebo were -0.14 (mirabegron 50 mg) and -0.12 
(mirabegron 100 mg) [Table 7]. Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant 
reduction from baseline to final visit in mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours compared with 
placebo. 
† The ANCOVA model included treatment group, gender and geographical region as fixed factors and baseline as a

•  Subjective Improvement Assessments 
Overactive Bladder Symptoms, Quality of Life and Treatment Benefit 
The Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q), the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) and 
the Treatment Satisfaction-Visual Analog Scale (TS-VAS) were the subjective outcome measures 
included in this study to evaluate treatment effects as perceived by the patient.  
- 
The OAB-q is a self-report questionnaire with 33 items that contain the dimensions Coping, 
Concern, Sleep, Social Interaction and a Symptom Bother scale with 8 symptoms. Scores 
range from 0 to 100 with a score of 100 indicating the worst severity. A negative change 
indicates improvement.  
-  Health-Related Quality of Life Total Score and Subscales (Coping, Concern Sleep and Social 
Interaction). Higher scores on the HRQL subscales and total score indicated a better QoL, and a 
positive change in the HRQL subscale scores and total score indicated improvement. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012  
Page 82/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool using a 6-point Likert scale that asks patients to 
rate their subjective impression of their current bladder condition. 
The TS-VAS is a visual analog scale (VAS) that asks patients to rate their satisfaction with the 
treatment by placing a vertical mark on a line that runs from 0 (No, not at all) to 10 (Yes, 
completely). Positive change from baseline indicates improvement. 
Mirabegron 50 mg demonstrated a statistically significant decrease (improvement) from baseline to 
final visit in the Symptom Bother Scale total score compared with placebo in the pooled data set 
[Table 1]. Further, mirabegron 50 mg demonstrated a statistically significant increase 
(improvement) from baseline to final visit in the HRQL total score and all its subscales including 
coping, concern and sleep compared with placebo except for the Social Interaction subscale.

Treatment Satisfaction-Visual Analogue Scale 
Treatment satisfaction was assessed on a VAS with complete satisfaction indicated by a score of 10, 
with positive change from baseline indicating improvement. The mean TS-VAS score at baseline was 
comparable across all treatment groups. The adjusted mean changes from baseline to final visit were 
1.25, 2.01 and 2.33 for the placebo, mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg groups, respectively. 
The adjusted mean differences versus placebo were 0.76 (mirabegron 50 mg) and 1.08 (mirabegron 
100 mg). Each mirabegron group demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline to final 
visit in TS-VAS score compared with placebo.

Patient Perception of Bladder Condition, FAS 
Baseline mean PPBC values were comparable across all treatment groups in each study. Mirabegron 50 
and 100 mg demonstrated statistically significant improvement in PPBC compared with placebo at final 
visit in Studies 178-CL-046 and 178-CL-047, with adjusted mean differences versus placebo of -0.2 for 
mirabegron 50 mg in both Studies 178-CL-046 and 178-CL-047, and -0.2 and -0.3 for mirabegron 100 
mg in Studies 178-CL-046 and 178-CL-047, respectively. 
Consistency Between Objective Endpoints and Subjective Endpoints  
Responderanalyses based on the pooled primary phase 3 studies are presented in order to provide a 
more precise estimate and additional power to detect differences between mirabegron 50 mg and 
placebo.

When patients were evaluated based on achieving a response both for the objective endpoint of 
achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in incontinence episodes per 24 hours and being a responder based on 
one of the 3 patient reported indices (symptom bother score, total HRQL score or PPBC value) 
evaluated based on MID, mirabegron 50 mg consistently demonstrated a statistically significant 
greater improvement over placebo for each of these double responder analyses performed [Table 9]. 
The difference from placebo in the responder rates for each of the double responder analyses was 
higher than the differences observed in the single responder analyses.

When patients were evaluated based on achieving a response for the objective endpoint of a ≥ 50% 
reduction in incontinence episodes per 24 hours and being a responder based on two patient reported 
indices (Symptom Bother Score and PPBC value or total HRQL score and PPBC value) evaluated based 
on MID, mirabegron 50 mg consistently demonstrated a statistically significant greater improvement

Clinical studies in special populations 
The applicant has not performed specific clinical studies in special populations. The consistency of 
treatment effects across subpopulations was evaluated using the pooled FAS and FAS-I of the three 
primary studies. Comparisons of subpopulations were made for the coprimary efficacy endpoints 
change from baseline to final visit in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and change 
from baseline to final visit in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours. 
Pooled analyses of the coprimary efficacy endpoints by subpopulations of demographic and baseline 
characteristics included gender, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) group and geographical 
region. 
Female subjects showed greater improvements than male subjects in mean numbers of micturitions, 
and incontinence episodes. This could be due to a smaller effect in men (who according to 
pharmacokinetic parameters exhibited a lower exposure than women) or be a consequence of the 
smaller numbers. 
Elderly patients (≥65 years; ≥75 years) experienced a greater reduction of micturitions and in 
incontinence episodes patient reported response than younger subjects.

Non-White subjects showed a lower reduction of incontinence episodes as well as of frequency. 
However the infra-representation of non-Caucasian subjects and the higher variability do not allow 
drawing conclusions in this regard.  
A more marked placebo effect for the different endpoints is observed among naïve patients, which may 
be responsible of the observed differences in response.

Phase 2a Proof-of-Concept Study 178-CL-008 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of mirabegron in patients with OAB in 
comparison with placebo. The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of mirabegron in patients with OAB in comparison with placebo, to compare the efficacy, 
safety and tolerability of mirabegron with tolterodine, and to collect population pharmacokinetics data 
in patients with OAB. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in mean number of 
micturition per 24 hours. 
Method  
After screening (day -21 to day -14), patients were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week placebo run-in 
period that ended at baseline (week 0). Patients meeting the inclusion criteria and not meeting 
exclusion criteria were randomized to receive mirabegron IR 100 or 150 mg twice daily, placebo, or 
tolterodine for 4 weeks. Subsequently, patients were followed for an additional 2 weeks with single-
blind placebo treatment.

Results:  
The mirabegron IR 100 and 150 mg twice daily groups showed statistically significant reductions in 
mean number of micturition per 24 hours compared with placebo. For the tolterodine group, the 
estimated adjusted mean difference vs placebo was -0.40 (P = 0.2332). Repeated measures analysis 
also showed statistically significant reduction in mean number of micturition per 24 hours in the 
mirabegron IR 100 and 150 mg twice daily groups compared with placebo, whereas the difference was 
not statistically significant for tolterodine.

Study 178-CL-048 
This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of mirabegron 50 mg versus placebo in the treatment 
of patients with symptoms of OAB based on mean number of micturition per 24 hours and to assess 
the safety and pharmacokinetics of mirabegron 50 mg. The study was also conducted to compare the 
efficacy and safety of mirabegron with tolterodine ER 4 mg without any formal testing for non-
inferiority or superiority of mirabegron. This study was conducted in Japan.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to final assessment in mean number of 
micturition per 24 hours.

For the primary efficacy endpoint, the mirabegron 50 mg group demonstrated a statistically 
significantly greater reduction from baseline to final visit compared with placebo in mean number of 
micturition per 24 hours in the FAS (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.86 [95% CI: -1.16, -
0.57]). The adjusted mean difference between tolterodine and placebo was -0.61 [95% CI: -0.90, -
0.32]).  
For the secondary efficacy endpoints, the mirabegron 50 mg group showed statistically significant 
improvements in mean number of urgency episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.54 [95% 
CI: -0.90, -0.18] in the FAS), mean number of incontinence episodes (adjusted mean difference vs 
placebo: -0.42 [95% CI: -0.67, -0.17] in the subset of the FAS with incontinence at baseline), mean 
number of urge incontinence episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.36 [95% CI: -0.59, -
0.12] in the subset of the FAS with incontinence at baseline), and mean volume voided per micturition 
(adjusted mean difference vs placebo: 14.775 mL [95% CI: 9.974, 19.576] in the FAS). For mean 
number of nocturia episodes, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo for mirabegron 50 mg was -
0.12 (95% CI: -0.25, 0.01). The tolterodine group showed statistically significant improvements in 
mean number of urgency episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.41 [95% CI: -0.77, -0.05] 
in the FAS), mean number of incontinence episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.32 [95% 
CI: -0.57, -0.06] in the subset of the FAS with incontinence at baseline), mean number of urge 
incontinence episodes (adjusted mean difference vs placebo: -0.32 [95% CI: -0.56, -0.08] in the 
subset of the FAS with incontinence at baseline), and mean volume voided per micturition (adjusted 
mean difference vs placebo: 19.049 mL [95% CI: 14.246, 23.852] in the FAS). For mean number of 
nocturia episodes, the adjusted mean difference versus placebo for tolterodine was -0.10 (95% CI: -
0.23, 0.03). In Study 178-CL-048, QOL scores were obtained from the King’s Health Questionnaire, 
which patients completed covering the 2 weeks prior to each study visit. Compared with placebo, the 
mirabegron 50 mg group showed a statistically significant improvement in 7 of 9 QOL domain scores: 
domain 2 (incontinence impact [P < 0.001]), domain 3 (role limitations [P < 0.001]), domain 4 
(physical limitations [P = 0.004]), domain 5 (social limitations [P = 0.005]), domain 7 (emotions [P = 
0.009]), domain 8 (sleep/energy [P = 0.016]) and domain 9 (severity measures [P < 0.001]). 
Study 178-CL-049 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment 
with mirabegron 50 and 100 mg in patients with symptoms of OAB. The secondary objectives of the 
study were to assess the efficacy of long-term treatment with mirabegron 50 and 100 mg in patients 
with symptoms of OAB and to place the long-term safety and efficacy of mirabegron in context with a 
standard treatment for OAB, tolterodine. 
Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of the study was the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE). 
Efficacy analyses were secondary in this study. The efficacy endpoints assessed were change from 
baseline to months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and final visit in the following: mean number of micturition per 24 
hours, mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, mean volume voided per micturition, 
mean number of urgency incontinence episodes per 24 hours, mean number of urgency episodes 
(grade 3 or 4) per 24 hours, mean level of urgency, mean number of pads used per 24 hours, and 
mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours.

Mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg demonstrated numeric reductions from baseline to Final Visit in mean 
number of micturition per 24 hours (adjusted mean change from baseline: -1.27 and -1.41, 
respectively) and mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours (adjusted mean change from 
baseline: -1.01 and -1.24, respectively) as well as numeric improvements in mean volume voided per 
micturition (adjusted mean change from baseline: 17.5 mL and 21.5 mL, respectively). the mean 
change from baseline to final visit in mean number of urgency episodes (grade 3 or 4) was -1.62, -
1.80 for the mirabegron 50 mg, 100 mg. Numerical improvements in mean number of urgency 
incontinence episodes per 24 hours were seen by month 1 and were maintained for the duration of the 
study. The mean change from baseline to final visit in the FAS was -1.01, -1.23 for the mirabegron 50 
mg, and 100 mg. Numerical improvements in mean number of pads used per 24 hours in the FAS were 
seen by month 1 continued until month 9 and were maintained for the duration of the study. Numerical 
improvements in mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours from baseline to final visit were 
observed for mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg, (-0.46, and -0.39 episodes respectively. Numerical 
improvements were seen from baseline to final visit for the mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron100 mg, 
and tolterodine groups in the TS-VAS, OAB-q scores, and the PPBC scale. Improvements in these 
symptoms were observed by month 1, with continued improvement until at least month 3 and 
maintenance of the effect through month 12. Both doses of mirabegron also showed numeric 
improvements on the additional secondary efficacy variables. Numerically similar results and a similar 
course of improvement over time were observed with tolterodine ER 4 mg. 
Study 178-CL-051 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety of long-term administration (52 weeks) of 
mirabegron at a dose of 50 mg in patients with OAB, with the possibility of dose escalation to 100 mg. 
Efficacy analyses were secondary in this study. 
The efficacy endpoints assessed were change from baseline to weeks 4, 8, 16, 28, 40 and 52 and final 
visit in the following: mean number of micturition per 24 hours, mean number of urgency episodes per 
24 hours, mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, mean number of urge incontinence 
episodes per 24 hours, mean number of nocturia episodes per 24 hours, and QOL domain scores on 
the King’s Health Questionnaire. 
Results (efficacy)  
At the final assessment, all patients demonstrated a reduction in mean number of incontinence 
episodes (-1.38), mean number of micturition (-2.01), mean number of urgency episodes (-3.16), 
mean number of urge incontinence episodes (-1.33) and the mean number of nocturia episodes (-
0.48). In the mirabegron 50 mg group, the reduction from baseline in all efficacy endpoints was 
maintained from the first assessment time point (week 8) to the final assessment (week 52). In the 
patients who received the increased dose of mirabegron 100 mg, the magnitude of improvements from 
baseline in all efficacy endpoints at week 8 was less than patients who remained on mirabegron 50 mg, 
but the improvements increased, and were comparable to those patients receiving mirabegron 50 mg 
from week 16 to final assessment. At final assessment, the respective changes from baseline in all 
efficacy endpoints assessed in the mirabegron 50 mg group and the group of patients who received the 
increased dose of mirabegron 100 mg were comparable and as follows: mean number of incontinence 
episodes (-1.30 and -1.56, respectively), mean number of micturition (-2.16 and -1.57, respectively), 
mean number of urgency episodes (-3.31 and -2.72, respectively), mean number of urge incontinence 
episodes (-1.32 and -1.33, respectively) and the mean number of nocturia episodes (-0.49 and -0.47, 
respectively). Normalization was defined as less than 8 micturition per day on average at the final 
assessment and resolution (0 episodes) of urge incontinence and nocturia at the final assessment. The

percentages of all mirabegron-treated patients that achieved normalization in mean number of 
incontinence episodes, micturitions, urgency episodes and nocturia episodes were 63.1%, 28.6%, 
36.2% and 23.0% respectively. Improvements in QOL scores in all domains were observed from 
baseline to final assessment for all patients. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Three pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group 12-week studies 
support the use of mirabegron 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg in the treatment of OAB (Studies CL-046, 
CL-047 and CL-074). Data from these three studies was integrated for pooled-analyses. 
The study design including the objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and efficacy endpoints of the 
pivotal studies are acceptable and, in general in agreement with the CHMP Guideline (Note for 
Guidance on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of urinary incontinence, 
CPMP/EWP/18/01).  
The population of subjects participating in this trial seems adequate and representative for patients 
with OAB. These studies enrolled male or female subjects (18 to 95 years of age inclusive) with 
symptoms or signs of overactive bladder with increased urinary frequency, urgency with or without 
incontinence. Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable across the 3 treatment 
groups. Most of the subjects randomised were females (72-83%) and White (>90%). Median ages 
overall ranged from 59 to 61 years. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar 
among treatment groups within each of these trials. Patients of moderate severity were preferably 
recruited. Subjects had a mean of 11 to 12 micturitions per 24 hours, 2 to 3 incontinence episodes (if 
they were incontinent) and experienced urgency of moderate to severe intensity. Between 49% and 
60% of patients reported previous antimuscarinic treatment.  
Patients were treated for 12 weeks. In addition to placebo control, one of the pivotal trials also 
included tolterodine as active control arm.  
Efficacy was primarily based on the reduction in the urinary frequency (number of micturitions) and 
the number of incontinence episodes. Given that incontinence was not an inclusion criterion of the 
pivotal trials only a subgroup of the population fulfils the “co-primary” condition. This is considered to 
be a deficiency in the design of the pivotal studies as when the analysis of the incontinence endpoints 
based upon the full ITT population (FAS) was performed the overall treatment effect was reduced.  
Further the results for responder analyses (responders for zero incontinence episodes at final visit and 
responders for ≥ 50% reduction in incontinence episodes at final visit) in the individual studies did not 
always reach statistical significance. However, it is acknowledged by the CHMP that this may be due to 
inadequate statistical power as the studies were not planned to include sufficient patients for an 
analysis of responders. It is acknowledged by the CHMP that pooled results of responder analyses of 
studies 046, 047 and 048 showed statistical significance compared to placebo. 
The perception of the patients was not part of the primary assessment of the efficacy of the product. 
These measures are meant to provide reassurance to the clinical relevance of the changes experienced 
by the quantitative outcomes. This is especially significant in such a non-life threatening condition in 
which the improvement of the impact of the disease on patient’s daily lives should be among the main 
therapeutic objectives. The CHMP is of the view that the consideration of these outcomes as primary 
endpoint instead of “additional secondary” outcomes would have been more appropriate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012  
Page 93/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The tools used for assessment were validated in the target population. Also, a clinically relevant 
change in pre-specified domains was defined.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the principal variables (number of 
micturitions in 24 hours, number of incontinence episodes in 24 hours). Most symptoms related to 
secondary variables also showed a statistically significant difference from baseline after 12 weeks 
treatment.  
-  Regarding the number of micturitions the changes from baseline to final visit were -1.20 and -1.75 
for the placebo and mirabegron 50 mg groups, respectively. The effect on urinary frequency shows 
a modest net benefit for mirabegron of 0.55 over pacebo.  
- 
The effect of mirabegron on incontinence was assessed in a subset (about 70%) of the recruited 
population. The net benefit was a reduction of 0.4 incontinence episodes more than placebo. When 
the effect is expressed in a more meaningful way (as responder analyses) mirabegron achieves 
equal or less than 10% responders than placebo.  
No clear dose-dependent effect has been observed. The Dose of 100 mg did not globally work better 
than 50 mg. The 25 mg dose exhibited a lower effect (mostly in secondary measures) than 50 mg. 
When subgroup populations were compared female and elderly patients showed somewhat greater 
improvements. Urgency and nocturia albeit reaching statistical significance appear to be less sensitive 
to the action of mirabegron.  
Indirect comparison of the effect observed with mirabegron 50 mg on the co-primary endpoint 
(incontinence and micturitions) and the ones seen for fesoterodine, solifenacin, trospium chloride, 
darifenacine and tolterodine from publicly available sources show that the effect of mirabegron is 
within the range of the means values for the other products.  
In addition, a comparability exercise for the improvement in incontinence episodes between 
antimuscarinics and mirabegron was taken into account. Data for antimuscarinics where taken from a 
study recently published (Shamliyan et al, 20125) where the relative risk for the endpoint of

continence (zero incontinence) and clinically important improvement in incontinence (>50% reduction 
in incontinence) have been calculated.  
Results, again, show comparable data for the relative risk, and a slightly lower effect of mirabegron for 
the absolute risk difference. Limitations of such indirect comparison are acknowledged however this 
results suggest comparable efficacy as for other approved drugs for OAB.  
In this respect, also comparative effects of mirabegron with tolterodine as shown in the development 
program reveals an effect of similar magnitude both in short and long term treatment.  
Three main measures were used to capture the subjective perception of patients with respect to the 
benefit of the treatment with mirabegron and the potential improvement of the condition. These 
instruments were based on a Visual Analogue Scale (TS-VAS), a Likert scale (PPBC) and a 
questionnaire about relevant aspects of the disease in the quality of life (OAB-q): bother, coping, 
concern, sleep and social interaction. The minimally important difference (MID) for OAB-q is considered 
to be 10 points; for PPBC it is considered to be one and for TS-VAS a threshold of 1cm as the smallest 
integer value is utilised for assessing clinical impact.  
At baseline patients scored their satisfaction level (TS-VAS) from 5 to 6. After 12 weeks they improved 
- 1.25 with placebo and -2.0 with mirabegron 50 mg (mean differences 0.76).  
With respect to the perception of the disease (PPBC) the patients initially considered that their 
condition represented minor to moderate problems (baseline values 3.8). The treatment with 
mirabegron meant an improvement of -0.2 compared to placebo.  
With respect to the impact on the quality of life (OAB-q) the greatest effect was seen in the “bother” 
domain. However, in principle the changes from baseline with respect to placebo for the dosage finally

EMA/706651/2012  
Page 95/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chosen do not reach the minimal 10-point difference on any OAB-q subscale to be considered clinically 
meaningful. 
With respect to the fact that the modest effect is not translated into a clear perception of improvement 
by the patients, the CHMP acknowledges that the instruments developed to study Patient related 
outcomes measure different components and different domains, that some of them are specific while 
others are overarching in their evaluation and related to a more broad assessment. Taking these 
observations in mind at least a consistent trend in the majority of the domains would be necessary to 
conclude on an effect of mirabegron treatment on patient’s perception. For mirabegron indeed a trend 
is seen for most of the domains in all studies. The size effect seems not to be impressive (around 8% 
versus placebo when the responder rate is considered) but these findings are in line with the modest 
effect seen on clinical endpoints. 
Some reassurance can also be obtained from the analyses of responders conducted where, with 
different definitions of responders, the responder rate is statistically significantly better (and in a 
consistent way) for mirabegron than for placebo. This is of greater clinical relevance when more 
stringent definitions of responder based on predefined minimal important differences are used.

Long-term efficacy data of mirabegron are based on a primarily aimed safety study. Efficacy outcomes 
have been measured as secondary endpoints and the main evidence comes from the non-formal 
comparison between mirabegron (50 mg and 100 mg) and tolterodine. Although the results obtained 
at 12 months do not suggest a loss of efficacy, the lack of a placebo control arm and the absence of a 
pre-determined statistical comparison hamper reaching sound conclusions regarding the maintenance 
of the effect of mirabegron. However in the comparative review from publicly available sources 
mirabegron does not show a distinct behaviour from other medicinal products approved for that 
condition (i.e. antimuscarinic drugs). In this respect, comparative effects of mirabegron with 
tolterodine help to put in context the results as the comparison reveals an effect of similar magnitude 
both in short and long (52 weeks) term treatment. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
As a summary, a consistent effect is observed in favour to mirabegron for both the co-primary and the 
secondary endpoints that in most cases is statistically significant. The comparison with tolterodine 
reveals an effect of similar magnitude. In addition, the effect size on incontinence episodes and 
number of micturitions per day observed in indirect comparisons with antimuscarinics helps put into 
context the clinical benefit of mirabegron. Therefore, the magnitude of the effect of mirabegron, 
although modest, can be considered enough to conclude on the clinically meaningful effect of this 
medicinal product in the treatment of OAB.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical development program for mirabegron consisted of studies in 10,552 healthy volunteers, 
patients with OAB, male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms/bladder outlet obstruction 
(LUTS/BOO) or patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 29 phase 1 studies and 12 phase 2/3 
studies (9 in patients with OAB, one in patients with LUTS/BOO and 2 in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus) have been conducted globally in Europe, United States (US), Canada, Japan, Australia/New 
Zealand and South Africa. The entire clinical development program is comprised of 1800 volunteers 
and 8752 patients (8433 patients with OAB) in support of this application. The safety of mirabegron 
has been investigated in 1462 volunteers in phase 1 studies and 5863 patients (5648 patients with 
OAB) in the phase 2/3 studies. A total of 622 of the 5648 patients with OAB received mirabegron for at 
least 1 year. The immediate release (IR) formulation was used for the earlier phase 1 and proof of 
concept (POC) studies conducted in the clinical development program; all subsequent studies used the 
oral controlled absorption system (OCAS) formulation.

The Safety Analysis Set consists of all patients who took at least one dose of study drug. Overall, 5863 
patients received at least one dose of mirabegron in the phase 2/3 clinical program. This total 
represents the number of unique patients in the Global Phase 2/3 Population who received mirabegron 
and includes the following: 
4414 patients from the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population (including the subset of 2736 
patients from the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population); 
345 patients from other phase 2 studies in type 2 diabetes mellitus, OAB and LUTS/BOO; 
901 patients from the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population who received mirabegron for the first 
time in Study 178-CL-049; and 203 patients from the Japan Long-term Uncontrolled Population. 
Overall, 5016/5863 (85.6%) patients completed treatment with mirabegron and 847/5863 (14.4%) 
patients discontinued mirabegron.  
The EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population comprises patients that were enrolled in Study 178-CL-
049, a 12-month, double-blind phase 3 study with an active-controlled tolterodine comparator arm. 
Patients who completed Studies 178-CL-046 and 178-CL-047 were allowed to participate in this study 
after a 30-day washout period; patients naive to the mirabegron program were also allowed to 
participate. In this study, 812 patients treated with mirabegron 50 mg, 820 patients treated with 
mirabegron 100 mg and 812 patients treated with tolterodine were randomized into the study and took 
double-blind study drug. 
A total of 629/812 (77.5%) mirabegron 50 mg, 645/820 (78.7%) mirabegron 100 mg and 621/812 
(76.5%) tolterodine patients completed double-blind treatment period while 183/812 (22.5%) 
mirabegron 50 mg, 175/820 (21.3%) mirabegron 100 mg and 191/812 (23.5%) tolterodine patients 
discontinued from the study.  
Adverse events  
In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, the most frequently reported TEAE (by PT) reported 
in the total mirabegron group were nasopharyngitis (mirabegron: 296/4414 [6.7%]; placebo: 
141/2142 [6.6%]; tolterodine: 57/958 [5.9%]), hypertension (mirabegron: 221/4414 [5.0%]; 
placebo: 107/2142 [5.0%]; tolterodine: 43/958 [4.5%]) and blood glucose increased (mirabegron: 
207/4414 [4.7%]; placebo: 115/2142 [5.4%]; tolterodine: 73/958 [7.6%]). One or more drug-related 
TEAE was reported by 906/4414 (20.5%) mirabegron, 389/2142 (18.2%) placebo and 275/958 
(28.7%) tolterodine patients, with similar reporting in each of the mirabegron dose groups. The most 
frequently reported drug-related TEAE (by PT) in the total mirabegron group were hypertension 
(mirabegron: 142/4414 [3.2%]; placebo: 63/2142 [2.9%]; tolterodine: 33/958 [3.4%]), dry mouth 
(mirabegron: 73/4414 [1.7%]; placebo: 37/2142 [1.7%]; tolterodine:100/958 [10.4%]) and

constipation (mirabegron: 68/4414 [1.5%]; placebo: 32/2142 [1.5%]; tolterodine: 21/958 [2.2%]). In 
the total mirabegron group, the maximum TEAE severity was mild for 36.9%, moderate for 18.0% and 
severe for 4.3% of patients. The most frequently reported severe TEAE were headache (13/5863 
[0.2%]), nasopharyngitis (10/5863 [0.2%]) and supraventricular extrasystoles (10/5863 [0.2%]). 
TEAE with missing severity (not provided by the study site) were included in the severe category. A 
total of 38/5863 (0.6%) mirabegron patients reported at least one TEAE with missing severity that 
were counted as severe. TEAE with missing severity were primarily AE associated with clinically 
significant changes in ECGs (for which severity was not assessed in Japan studies) or AE associated 
with clinical laboratory findings. 
For placebo, the maximum TEAE severity was mild for 38.3%, moderate for 13.8% and severe for 
3.1% of patients; for tolterodine the maximum TEAE severity was mild for 44.7%, moderate for 12.2% 
and severe for 3.3% of patients. The proportion of patients reporting at least one severe TEAE was 
similar across dose groups. 
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Cardiovascular System 
Hypertension  
In the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population, TEAE related to hypertension were similar for the total 
mirabegron (230/2736 [8.4%]), placebo (117/1380 [8.5%]) and tolterodine (48/495 [9.7%]) groups. 
The frequency of hypertension TEAE was comparable for mirabegron doses of 50 mg (120/1375 
[8.7%]) or 100 mg (58/929 [6.2%]) and was highest in mirabegron 25 mg (52/432 [12.0%]). In the 
EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the occurrence of hypertension TEAE was comparable 
between mirabegron 50 and 100 mg (89/812 [11.0%] and 83/820 [10.1%]) and tolterodine (86/812 
[10.6%]). 
QT prolongation or its sequelae  
In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, QTc prolongation-related TEAE were reported in 
4/4414 (0.1%) total mirabegron patients, 2/2142 (0.1%) placebo patients and 2/958 (0.2%) 
tolterodine patients. In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, QTc prolongation-related TEAE 
were reported in 3/812 (0.4%) mirabegron 50 mg patients, 2/820 (0.2%) mirabegron 100 mg patients 
and 3/812 (0.4%) tolterodine patients. TEAE in the torsades de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ was 
reported as SAE for 1/812 (0.1%) patient in the mirabegron 50 mg group (cardiac arrest, ventricular 
fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia; these concurrent CV events were adjudicated by the 
Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee for Clinical Trials with Mirabegron as a nonfatal myocardial 
infarction) and 1/812 (0.1%) patient in the tolterodine group (cardiac arrest, adjudicated by the 
Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee for Clinical Trials with Mirabegron to ventricular fibrillation). 
Cardiac Arrhythmia, Including Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation 
In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, TEAE related to rapid pulse rate (cardiac arrhythmia, 
mostly tachycardia) were more frequently observed in all active treatments (2.4 to 6.6%) than placebo 
(1.8%). The frequency of TEAE in cardiac arrhythmia was comparable for all mirabegron doses of 100 
mg or less (2.4 to 3.1%) and tolterodine (3.1%) and was highest in mirabegron 200 mg (6.6%). In 
the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the occurrence of TEAE in the cardiac arrhythmia SMQ 
was comparable between mirabegron 50 and 100 mg (3.9 and 4.1%, respectively) and was less than 
tolterodine (6.0%). The overall occurrence of tachycardia events either based on TEAE or observations 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012

of pulse rate ≥ 100 bpm captured by patient diary, was 28/812 (3.4%) mirabegron 50 mg, 50/820 
(6.1%) mirabegron 100 mg and 55/812 (6.8%) tolterodine patients. 
Cardiac Failure 
In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, TEAE of CHF based on the SMQ of cardiac failure 
occurred in 14/2142 (0.7%), 4/811 (0.5%), 14/2131 (0.7%), 15/1305 (1.1%), and 5/958 (0.5%) 
patients in the placebo, mirabegron 25, mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine 
treatment groups, respectively; no events were observed for mirabegron 200 mg. The majority of 
cardiac failure TEAE were from the higher level term (HLT) of oedema not elsewhere classified (NEC) 
(29/33 patients in the total mirabegron group). In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, TEAE of 
CHF based on the SMQ of cardiac failure occurred in 10/812 (1.2%), 6/820 (0.7%) and 9/812 (1.1%) 
patients for mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine, respectively. The majority of 
cardiac failure TEAE were from the HLT of oedema NEC (12/16 patients in the total mirabegron group). 
Syncope, Postural Hypotension and falls 
In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, one or more syncope, postural hypotension and falls 
events were reported by 90/4414 (2.0%) mirabegron, 35/2142 (1.6%) placebo and 14/958 (1.5%) 
tolterodine patients, with no apparent mirabegron dose response. The majority of events were under 
the category of falls; one or more syncope or postural hypotension events was reported by ≤ 0.1% of 
patients for both total mirabegron and placebo; there were no events reported with tolterodine. One or 
more events of falls was reported by 86/4414 (1.9%) mirabegron, 32/2142 (1.5%) placebo and 
14/958 (1.5%) tolterodine patients, with no apparent mirabegron dose response. The most common 
TEAE (by PT) in the total mirabegron group under the category of falls was contusion (mirabegron: 
13/4414 [0.3%]); placebo: 8/2142 [0.4%]; tolterodine: 4/958 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, one or more SAE was reported for 77/4414 (1.7%) 
mirabegron, 38/2142 (1.8%) placebo and 16/958 (1.7%) tolterodine patients, with no apparent 
mirabegron dose response. The most common SAE in the total mirabegron group were atrial fibrillation 
(mirabegron: 5/4414 [0.1%]; placebo: 1/2142 [< 0.1%]; tolterodine: 0/958), chest pain (mirabegron: 
4/4414 [0.1%]; placebo: 2/2142 [0.1%]; tolterodine: 0/958) and pneumonia (mirabegron: 4/4414 
[0.1%]; placebo: 1/2142 [< 0.1%]; tolterodine: 0/958). One or more drug-related SAE was reported 
by 17/4414 (0.4%) mirabegron, 8/2142 (0.4%) placebo and 7/958 (0.7%) tolterodine patients, with 
no apparent mirabegron dose response. The most common drug-related SAE in the total mirabegron 
group was atrial fibrillation (mirabegron: 3/4414 [0.1%]); there were no SAE of atrial fibrillation for 
placebo or tolterodine patients In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, one or more SAE was 
reported by 93/1632 (5.7%) mirabegron patients (mirabegron 50 mg: 42/812 [5.2%]; mirabegron 
100 mg: 51/820 [6.2%]) and 44/812 (5.4%) tolterodine patients. The most common SAE in the total 
mirabegron group were osteoarthritis (mirabegron: 3/1632 [0.2%]; tolterodine: 1/812 [0.1%]) and 
cerebrovascular accident (mirabegron: 3/1632 [0.2%]; tolterodine: 1/812 [0.1%]). A total of 11/820 
(1.3%) patients in the mirabegron 100 mg group had one or more SAE in the neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) SOC; 1/812 (0.1%) in the mirabegron 50 mg group 
and 4/812 (0.5%) in the tolterodine group had SAE in that SOC.

Deaths  
There were 11 deaths in the mirabegron program, including 2 deaths in the ongoing 178-CL-090 study 
(one death on blinded treatment and one death that occurred prior to randomization). Nine deaths 
occurred in patients participating in completed trials (5 patients treated with mirabegron, one treated 
with placebo and 3 treated with tolterodine). All deaths were adjudicated for potential inclusion as a 
cardiovascular death by the Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee. The following is a brief listing of 
all 11 deaths presented by assigned dose group.

Overall, mortality per 1000 patients years of mirabegron exposure was comparable to placebo and 
tolterodine, except the mirabegron/tolterodine group in the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population 
was higher than mirabegron alone (6.4 vs 2.5, mortality per 1000 patient-years of exposure). Of the 5 
deaths that occurred in the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, 3 patients received mirabegron 
and 2 patients received tolterodine at the time of death. The 2 patients who received tolterodine had 
prior exposure to mirabegron in a previous study.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology  
Across populations, there were 3/5863 (0.1%) mirabegron patients with a SAE from the SOC of Blood 
and Lymphatic System Disorders. 
Safety analyses showed a reduction in the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils, and a positive 
correlation with mirabegron dose was observed.  
In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the frequency of patients with clinical threshold 
of grade 2 lymphocytes was higher for the mirabegron 100 mg group (25/800 [3.1%]) compared 
with the mirabegron 50 mg group (14/792 [1.8%]) and the tolterodine group (11/790 [1.4%]), 
summarized in the table below [Module 5.3.5.3 ISS, End-of-Text Table 7.7.2].

Changes in haematological counts in the Phase 2/3 OAB population view were modest and transient 
and even being more apparent with 100 mg dose, these changes were quantitatively limited. 
Admittedly, the fact that a group of patients receiving 100 mg (two times the proposed dose) achieved 
the clinical threshold of grade 2 lymphocytes still represents an object of concern. The Applicant has 
attributed this fact to presence of decreased (or borderline) values at baseline for a number of 
patients. This justification dose not rule out a real relationship, mainly when this feature is also 
detected in the long term safety population. 
In summary, whereas data for mirabegron 50 mg do not suggest being object of concern for 
lymphocytes a potential effect (at least with higher doses) cannot be considered totally discarded.  
Chemistry  
Liver  
Overall,  1/5860  (<  0.1%)  one  mirabegron  patient  experienced  a  PCS  hepatic  chemistry  laboratory 
abnormality of ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN and ALP < 2 x ULN on the same 
date; the results are the same when values within 3 days are considered. Two patients were identified 
as having 3 fold or more transaminase elevation combined with 2 fold or more bilirubin elevation. One 
patient  in  the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled  Population  had  3  fold  or  more  transaminase  elevation 
combined with 2 fold or more bilirubin elevation Study 178-CL-049]. 
In  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3  Population,  one  or  more  hepatotoxicity  TEAE  was  reported  by 
242/4414  (5.5%)  mirabegron,  121/2142  (5.6%)  placebo  and  78/958  (8.1%)  tolterodine  patients.  A 
total  of  3  patients  (one  each  in  the  mirabegron  25  mg,  mirabegron  50  mg  and  tolterodine  groups)

experienced  hepatotoxicity  SAE.  The  mirabegron  25  mg  patient  experienced  an  SAE  of  liver  function 
test abnormal, the mirabegron 50 mg patient experienced an SAE of hepatic enzyme increased and the 
tolterodine  patient  experienced  an  SAE  of  hepatitis.  In  the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled  Population, 
hepatotoxicity  was  reported  as  a  TEAE  for  36/1632  (2.2%)  mirabegron  patients  (tolterodine:  15/812 
[1.8%]),  from  laboratory data  for  37/1632  (2.3%) mirabegron  patients  (tolterodine:  14/812  [1.7%]) 
and  both  as  a  TEAE  and  from  laboratory  data  for  19/1632  (1.2%)  mirabegron  patients  (tolterodine: 
7/812 [0.9%]). 
Renal  
A total of 3 mirabegron 25 mg patients and one mirabegron 200 mg patient had a potentially clinically 
significant  increase  in  serum  creatinine  (>  177  mcmol/L)  on  at  least  one  measurement.  For  all  3 
patients,  the  potentially  clinically  significant  value  for  creatinine  occurred  on  a  single  occasion.  These 
patients had serum creatinine levels above the ULN at baseline and throughout the study. None of the 
3 patients experienced a TEAE related to abnormal renal function. For BUN, the frequency of patients 
with  potentially  clinically  significant  increase  in  BUN  (>  12.5  mmol/L)  was  comparable  across 
treatment groups 
Glucose and HbA1c (Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders) 
Endocrine  and  metabolic  disorders  were  assessed  separately  as  AE  of  interest  in  the  mirabegron 
development  program  primarily  because  of  the  theoretical  potential  for  beta  3-AR  to  influence 
metabolic  function,  inclusive  of  glucose  regulation.  The  early  clinical  development  of  mirabegron 
included  2  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  12-week  phase  2a  POC  studies  evaluating  mirabegron  in 
the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Study 178-CL-003 examined the effect of placebo and mirabegron 
administered in addition to diet and exercise for 12 weeks in the treatment of 59 patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Mirabegron was administered as an  IR  formulation given once daily in the morning 
with 3 escalating dose levels (60 mg, 130 mg and 200 mg). The primary endpoint of the study was the 
change from baseline in HbA1c. Fasting blood glucose values were measured throughout the study and 
showed no difference between the change from baseline to final visit in the mirabegron (0.34 mmol/L) 
and placebo (0.32 mmol/L) treatment groups. There were no reports of hypoglycaemia in this study.  
Study  178-CL-004  examined  the  effect  of  placebo  and  mirabegron  administered  in  addition  to 
metformin,  diet  and  exercise  for  12  weeks  in  the  treatment  of  60  patients  with  type  2  diabetes 
mellitus.  Mirabegron  was  administered  as  an  IR  formulation  given  once  daily  in  the  AM  with  3 
escalating  dose  levels  (60  mg,  130  mg  and  200  mg).  The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  the 
change from baseline in HbA1c. Fasting blood glucose values were measured throughout the study and 
showed  no  difference  between  the  change  from  baseline  to  final  visit  in  the mirabegron  +  metformin 
(0.88 mmol/L) and placebo + metformin (0.87 mmol/L) treatment groups. There were no observations 
of hypoglycaemic events in this study. 
The  frequency  of  hypoglycaemia  and  hyperglycaemia  TEAE  and  laboratory  measurements  of  blood 
glucose  and  HbA1c  in  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3  Population  and  in  the  EU/NA  Long-term 
Controlled  Population  were  similar  across  treatment  groups.  In  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3 
Population,  the  frequency  of  hypoglycaemia  was  reported  by  31/4414  (0.7%)  mirabegron,  19/2142 
(0.9%)  placebo  and  10/958  (1.0%)  tolterodine  patients.  No  patients  in  the  EU/NA  Long-term 
Controlled  Population  reported  a  hypoglycaemia  TEAE.  In  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3 
Population,  one  or  more  hyperglycaemia  TEAE  was  reported  by  249/4414  (5.6%)  mirabegron, 
134/2142 (6.3%) placebo and 85/958 (8.9%) tolterodine patients. In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled 
Population,  one  or  more  hyperglycaemia  TEAE  was  reported  by  30/1632  (1.8%)  mirabegron  patients 
(mirabegron  50  mg:  16/812  [2.0%];  mirabegron  100  mg:  14/820  [1.7%])  and  13/812  (1.6%)

tolterodine patients. No patient reported a hypoglycaemia SAE, hyperglycaemia SAE or hypoglycaemia 
TEAE  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  In  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3 
Population,  one  patient  in  the  mirabegron  25  mg  group  reported  a  hyperglycaemia  TEAE  (blood 
glucose increased) that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug.  
Thyroid function  
Two thyroid function-related serious adverse events were reported in the mirabegron clinical program 
(one with mirabegron 100 mg and one with tolterodine). 
Vital signs  
Pulse rate  
•  Mirabegron  administered  at  the  proposed  therapeutic  dose  of  50  mg  once  daily  in  the  12-week 
studies  was  associated  with  an  approximately  1  bpm  increased  adjusted  mean  change  from 
baseline  pulse  rate  compared  with  placebo.  The  adjusted  mean  difference  vs  placebo  for  change 
from baseline pulse rate in the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population receiving mirabegron 25, 
50 and 100 mg and tolterodine was 0.9, 1.0, 1.9 and 1.0 bpm for AM measurements and 0.6, 1.0, 
2.3 and 2.1 bpm for PM measurements. 
• 
In  the  EU/NA  OAB  Phase  3  Population,  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  pulse  rate 
following mirabegron at doses of 50 to 100 mg once daily was similar to or less than the adjusted 
mean  change  from  baseline  pulse  rate  following  tolterodine  in  the  long  term  study.  The  adjusted 
mean  change  from  baseline  pulse  rate  in  the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled  Population  for  the 
mirabegron  50  mg,  100  mg  and  tolterodine  groups  was  0.9,  1.6  and  1.5  bpm  for  AM 
measurements and 0.4, 1.3 and 1.9 bpm for PM measurements. 
•  Categorical increases in pulse rate in the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population were noted more 
frequently  at  various  cut-points  with  mirabegron  than  with  placebo.  Mirabegron  25  and  50  mg 
were  roughly  comparable  to  tolterodine  while  mirabegron  100  mg  demonstrated  more  outliers  at 
various  cut-points  than  tolterodine.  In  the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled  Population,  the  proposed 
therapeutic dose of 50 mg showed fewer outliers at the various cut-points than either tolterodine 
or mirabegron 100 mg.

• 
TEAE  related  to  rapid  pulse  rate  (cardiac  arrhythmia,  mostly  tachycardia)  were  more  frequently 
observed  in  all  active  treatments  (2.4  to  6.6%)  than  placebo  (1.8%)  in  the  Global  OAB  12-week 
Phase  2/3  Population.  The  frequency  of  such  events  was  roughly  comparable  for  all  mirabegron 
doses of 100 mg or less (2.4 to 3.1%) and tolterodine (3.1%). In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled 
Population,  the  occurrence  of  such  events  was  comparable  between  mirabegron  50  and  100  mg 
(3.9 and 4.1%, respectively) and was less than tolterodine (6.0%). 
The overall frequency of atrial fibrillation TEAE was low (0.2%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6% and 0.6% 
for  placebo,  mirabegron  25,  50,  100  and  200  mg,  and  tolterodine,  respectively)  and  comparable 
for  mirabegron  and  tolterodine  in  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3  Population.  In  the  EU/NA 
Long-term  Controlled  Population,  the  overall  frequency  of  atrial  fibrillation  TEAE  was  low  (0.7%, 
0.5% and 0.9% for mirabegron 50 and 100 mg and tolterodine, respectively) and comparable for 
the mirabegron and tolterodine groups. 
Female  patients  demonstrated  a  generally  higher  increase  in  pulse  rate  compared  with  male 
patients,  consistent  with  the  approximately  40  to  50%  increased  exposure  in  female  patients, 
although  this  finding  was  inconsistent  across  treatment  groups  and  AM/PM  measurements.  In 
patients  who  received  the  proposed  mirabegron  therapeutic  dose  of  50  mg,  pulse  rate  changes 
from  baseline  compared  with  placebo  were  approximately  1  bpm  or  less  and  pulse  rate  changes

from  baseline  were  similar  to  those  in  patients  who  received  tolterodine,  in  both  the  12-week 
studies and the long-term study, in both genders. 
•  Overall data suggest a greater effect of mirabegron on pulse rate in younger compared with older 
patients,  although  this  finding  was  inconsistent.  For  the  12-week  studies,  there  were  no  clear 
trends observed in change from baseline to final visit in pulse rate for patients < 65 years vs. ≥ 65 
years  in  any  treatment  group,  while  in  the  long-term  study,  changes  from  baseline  AM  and  PM 
pulse rate were greater in patients < 65 years of age than in patients ≥ 65 years of age. Pulse rate 
changes in the mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg groups were similar or less than the changes in the 
tolterodine group in both age groups. In an additional analysis, stratifying patients into < 45 years, 
≥  45  to  <  65  years  and  ≥  65  years  of  age,  change  from  baseline  and  difference  vs  placebo  in 
change  from  baseline  were  generally  smaller  in  older  compared  with  younger  patients  receiving 
mirabegron, with the greatest change generally seen in patients < 45 years of age in the 12-week 
studies, while in the long-term study, change from baseline for pulse rate was small and similar in 
older  and  younger  patients.  Patients  who  received  mirabegron  50  mg,  the  proposed  therapeutic 
dose,  had  a  difference  vs  placebo  in  change  from  baseline  pulse  rate  of  approximately  1  bpm  or 
less in all 3 age categories, except for a 3 bpm increase in PM but not AM pulse rate for patients < 
45 years of age in the 12-week studies. Pulse rate changes in patients who received mirabegron 50 
mg were similar to those in patients who received tolterodine, in both the 12-week studies and the 
long-term  study  in  all  3  age  categories.  This  included  greater  increases  in  the  placebo-difference 
change from baseline in PM but  not AM pulse rate  for patients < 45 years of  age in the 12-week 
studies. 
•  Overall, the increase in pulse rate in the OAB population associated with the proposed therapeutic 
mirabegron  dose  of  mirabegron  50  mg  was  approximately  1  bpm,  similar  to  tolterodine,  and  did 
not result in more outliers or tachycardia-related AE than observed with tolterodine. 
Blood Pressure 
•  Mirabegron administered at the proposed therapeutic dose of 50 mg once daily was associated with 
an  approximately  1  mm  Hg  or  less  adjusted  mean  difference  for  change  from  baseline  SBP/DBP 
compared with placebo. The adjusted mean difference vs placebo for change from baseline SBP in 
the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population in mirabegron 25, 50 and 100 mg and tolterodine was 
-0.5, 0.6, 0.4 and  -0.1 mm Hg  for AM measurements and -1.0, 0.5, 0.9 and  -0.0 mm Hg for  PM 
measurements.  The  adjusted  mean  difference  vs  placebo  for  change  from  baseline  DBP  in  the 
EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 Population in mirabegron 25, 50 and 100 mg and tolterodine was -
0.1,  0.4,  0.2  and  0.7  mm  Hg  for  AM  measurements  and  -0.3,  0.4,  0.5  and  1.0  mm  Hg  for  PM 
measurements. 
• 
In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, the adjusted mean changes from baseline SBP and 
DBP following mirabegron 50 mg, mirabegron 100 mg and tolterodine were generally similar. The 
adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  for  SBP  in  mirabegron  50  and  100  mg  and  tolterodine  was 
0.2,  0.4  and  -0.5  mm  Hg  for  AM  measurements  and  -0.3,  0.1  and  -0.0  mm  Hg  for  PM 
measurements,  respectively.  The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  for  DBP  in  mirabegron  50 
and 100 mg and tolterodine was -0.3, 0.4 and 0.1 mm Hg for AM measurements and -0.0, 0.1 and 
0.6 mm Hg for PM measurements, respectively. 
•  Categorical increases from baseline in SBP and DBP for the EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase 3 and the 
EU/NA Long-term Controlled populations were generally comparable across all treatment groups. 
• 
TEAE  related  to  hypertension  were  similar  for  the  total  mirabegron  (230/2736  [8.4%]),  placebo 
(117/1380  [8.5%])  and  tolterodine  (48/495  [9.7%])  groups  in  the  EU/NA  OAB  12-week  Phase  3

Population.  The  frequency  of  such  events  was  comparable  for  mirabegron  50  mg  (120/1375 
[8.7%]) or 100 mg (58/929 [6.2%]) and was highest in mirabegron 25 mg (52/432 [12.0%]). In 
the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled  Population,  the  occurrence  of  such  events  was  comparable 
between  mirabegron  50  and  100  mg  (89/812  [11.0%]  and  83/820  [10.1%])  and  tolterodine 
(86/812 [10.6%]). 
•  Male patients had generally larger changes from baseline in adjusted mean difference vs placebo in 
SBP/DBP  in  the  12-week  studies  and  the  adjusted  mean  changes  in  SBP/DBP  in  the  long-term 
study, although this finding was inconsistent across treatment groups and AM/PM measurements. 
•  Overall data suggested a greater effect of mirabegron on SBP/DBP in younger compared with older 
patients,  although  this  finding  was  inconsistent.  No  consistent  trend  of  SBP/DBP  change  was 
evident in patients < 65 years of age compared with patients ≥ 65 years of age. In the 12-week 
studies, changes in adjusted mean difference vs placebo were generally similar in both age groups. 
In the long-term study, adjusted mean changes in AM/PM SBP were larger in patients ≥ 65 years, 
while changes in AM/PM DBP were larger in patients < 65 years of age. This trend in the long-term 
study was seen in both the mirabegron and tolterodine treatment groups. In an additional analysis, 
stratifying  patients  into  <  45  years,  ≥  45  to  <  65  years  and  ≥  65  years  of  age,  change  from 
baseline and adjusted mean difference vs placebo in change from baseline SBP/DBP was generally 
smaller  in  older  compared  with  younger  patients  who  received  mirabegron,  with  the  greatest 
change  generally  seen  in  patients  <  45  years  of  age.  This  trend  was  also  seen  in  the  adjusted 
mean change from baseline SBP/DBP measurements in the long-term study. Patients who received 
mirabegron  50  mg,  the  proposed  therapeutic  dose,  had  an  adjusted  mean  difference  vs  placebo 
and an adjusted mean change from baseline SBP/DBP of approximately 1 mm Hg or less in the 12-
week studies and the long-term study, respectively, comparable to tolterodine in both younger and 
older patients. 
•  Objective blood pressure decreases and/or hypotension were similar across treatment groups 
ECGs 
A brief summary of both the first and second TQT studies [Study 178-CL-037 and Study 178-CL-077, 
respectively]  and  events  potentially  suggestive  of  QTc  interval  prolongation  in  the  integrated  safety 
database are presented below. Excluding intervals related to rate (HR, RR interval) and QT, there are 
generally  no  trends  observed  in  the  remaining  ECG  intervals  (QRS  and  PR)  across  treatments  and 
subgroups  in  either  the  EU/NA  OAB  12-week  Phase  3  Population  or  the  EU/NA  Long-term  Controlled 
Population.  The  only  exceptions  are  small  and  inconsistent  baseline  to  end  point  changes  of  the  PR 
interval (3.8 msec or less) observed for the mirabegron 100 mg treatment group. These trends were 
more apparent in the  EU/NA OAB 12-week Phase Population than in the EU/NA Long-term Controlled 
Population and  were more apparent in male than female patients and patients ≥ 65 years of age vs. 
those  <  65  years  of  age.  This  mean  baseline  to  end  point  change  generally  did  not  manifest  itself  in 
more  outliers  based  on  maximum  PR  interval  for  the  mirabegron  100  mg  dosage  group.  A  slightly 
higher  frequency  of  1st  degree  atrio-ventricular  (AV)  block  was  observed  among  ECG  treatment-
emergent abnormalities for the mirabegron 100 mg treatment group (2.9% vs. 0.2% to 2.4% for the 
other  treatment  groups)  in  the  EU/NA  OAB  12-week  Phase  3  Population,  but  this  tendency  was  not 
replicated in the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population. 
Study  178-CL-037  evaluated  the  effects  of  100  mg  once  daily  and  200  mg  once  daily  oral  doses  of 
mirabegron  OCAS  at  steady  state  on  the  individually  corrected  QT  interval  (QTcI)  compared  with 
placebo. A single 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin or matching moxifloxacin placebo was incorporated into 
the  study  design  to  evaluate  assay  sensitivity.  The  study  included  25  healthy  male  and  23  healthy 
female volunteers.

Overall,  the  pharmacodynamic  results  demonstrated  that  mirabegron  prolongs  QT  interval  dose 
dependently,  with  a  differential  effect  in  males  and  females.  Reanalysis  of  QT  data  revealed  the 
following: 
-  Reduced  variability,  increased  effect  size  relative  to  the  original  analysis,  and  larger  effects 
overall  and  by  gender  (although  the  dose-dependency  and  gender  differences  remained 
consistent) 
-  Confirmation of the effect of mirabegron on QT interval with mirabegron 200 mg 
-  A statistically significant effect of mirabegron 100 and 200 mg on QT interval in females 
Study 178-CL-077 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel crossover, 
phase  1  TQT  study.  Healthy  volunteers  who  were  randomized  to  8  treatment  sequences  (10  days  of 
mirabegron  50  mg,  mirabegron  100  mg  or  mirabegron  200  mg,  or  9  days  of  placebo  followed  by  a 
single dose moxifloxacin 400 mg).  
- 
The upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI was less than 10 msec at all evaluated time points for 
all  subjects  receiving  the  therapeutic  dose  of  mirabegron  50  mg.  In  the  mirabegron  50  mg 
group, the largest treatment effect occurred at 3 to 4 hours with a mean (upper bound of the 
1-sided 95% CI) treatment difference of 3.66 (5.16) msec in all volunteers, 4.49 (6.81) msec 
in females and 2.96 (5.00) msec in males. 
- 
The  upper  bound  of  the  1-sided  95%  CI  was  also  less  than  10  msec  at  all  evaluated  time 
points  for  all  subjects  receiving  the  supratherapeutic  dose  of  mirabegron  100  mg  that  is 
associated  with  an  approximately  2.9-  and  2.6-fold  increase  in  Cmax  and  AUCtau  relative  to 
mirabegron 50 mg. In the mirabegron 100 mg group, the largest treatment effect occurred at 
4-5  hours  with  a  mean  (upper  bound  of  the  1-sided  95%  CI)  treatment  difference  of  6.19 
(7.65) msec in all volunteers, 7.70 (9.72) msec in females and 4.63 (6.45) msec in males. 
Mirabegron prolonged the QTc interval at the supratherapeutic dose of 200 mg, a dose which increased 
Cmax and AUCtau by approximately 8.4- and 6.5-fold relative to mirabegron 50 mg. In the mirabegron 
200 mg group, the largest QTcI treatment effect occurred at 4 to 5 hours with a mean (upper bound of 
the 1-sided 95% CI) treatment difference of 8.21 (9.99) msec in all volunteers, 10.42 (13.44) msec in 
females and 7.33 (9.42) msec in males. The increased QTc in female volunteers was consistent with 
their approximately 30% to 60% higher mean Cmax and 40% to 50% higher mean AUCtau of 
mirabegron compared to male volunteers. 
Phase 2/3 results in OAB patients  
The following key conclusions were noted for QTc in a subset of phase 2/3 studies in OAB patients: 
•  All  mirabegron  treatment  groups  had  a  decrease  in  mean  QTcF  from  baseline  to  12  weeks  of 
approximately  2  msec;  the  decrease  observed  for  mirabegron  200  mg  was  slightly  larger  at  4.4 
msec. 
• 
There  was  a  higher  occurrence  of  maximum  QTcF  measurements  >  450  msec  in  the  mirabegron 
200 mg group compared with placebo and compared with the lower mirabegron dose groups; the 
same trends were not observed for mirabegron 200 mg for maximum changes in baseline QTcF ≥ 
30  msec.  QTc  measurements  exceeding  these  thresholds  occurred  with  similar  frequency  in 
patients receiving mirabegron 25, 50 and 100 mg and placebo. 
•  Maximum  QTcF  values  >  450  msec  occurred  more  often  in  female  than  male  patients  with  a 
comparable frequency in all treatment groups except for mirabegron 200 mg. No differences were

• 
• 
observed between male and female patients in the frequency of maximum change from baseline in 
QTcF of ≥ 30 msec. 
Elderly OAB patients (≥ 65 years) had a higher frequency of maximum QTcF values > 450 msec; 
the frequency of maximum changes from baseline > 30 msec were similar for patients < 65 years 
and ≥ 65 years. 
There were few SAE, TEAE and CV adjudicated events that involved QT prolongation or ventricular 
arrhythmias and there was no difference between the frequency of these events in the mirabegron, 
placebo, and tolterodine groups. No events of torsades de pointes were reported in any patient in 
the mirabegron clinical program. 
Summary of ECG Data 
•  At  the  proposed  therapeutic  dose,  mirabegron  50  mg  did  not  have  a  clinically  meaningful 
treatment effect on QTc interval in females or males. 
• 
• 
Prolongation of the QT interval was seen for mirabegron in females at a supratherapeutic dose of 
200 mg and this treatment effect could be attributed to higher mirabegron exposure in females. A 
200  mg  dose  of  mirabegron  is  associated  with  an  8.4-  and  6.5-fold  increased  Cmax  and  AUCtau 
compared with a therapeutic 50 mg dose. 
In  OAB  patients,  there  was  a  higher  frequency  of  maximum  QTcF  measurements  >  450  msec  in 
the  mirabegron  200  mg  group  compared  with  placebo  and  compared  with  the  lower  mirabegron 
dose  groups.  Female  patients  had  higher  frequency  of  maximum  QTcF  values  >  450  msec  than 
male patients; however, the frequency in mirabegron dose groups lower than 200 mg was similar 
to that observed in placebo. 
Post-void residual Volume (PVR) 
There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  treatments  groups  in  mean  changes  from 
baseline to any post-baseline visit in PVR volume or in overall categorical shifts from baseline to post-
baseline PVR volume. Few patients had shifts from a baseline PVR volume < 150 mL to a PVR volume 
≥ 150 mL to < 300 mL post-baseline (54/4482 [1.2%] for total mirabegron in the subset of the Global 
Phase  2/3  Population  (all  studies  except  Studies  178-CL-003,  178-CL-004  and  178-CL-049;  0.4%  to 
1.1%  across  all  treatment  groups  for  the  Global  OAB  12-week  Phase  2/3  Population)  or  from  any 
baseline  value  to  a  PVR  volume  of  ≥  300  mL  post-baseline,  with  a  comparable  frequency  across 
treatment groups. In a urodynamic study in male patients with LUTS/BOO, mirabegron 50 mg and 100 
mg  did  not  affect  detrusor  pressure  at  maximum  urinary  flow  rate  or  urinary  flow  rate  in  men  with 
LUTS  and  BOO.  Two  TEAE  of  urinary  retention  were  reported  in  this  study;  one  in  the  placebo group 
and  one  in  the  mirabegron  100  mg  dose  group.  While  the  urinary  retention  event  in  the  placebo-
treated  patient  required  catheterization  and  the  event  resolved  without  invasive  intervention  in  the 
mirabegron 100 mg-treated patient, neither event was reported as an SAE. These events are expected 
in  the  patient  population  with  documented  BOO,  as  was  evaluated  in  this  study.  A  statistically 
significant increase in PVR volume was observed at week 12 with mirabegron 100 mg treatment that is 
considered  not  clinically  meaningful;  no  changes  in  PVR  volume  were  observed  with  mirabegron  50 
mg; this increase was < 30 mL. 
Immunological events 
A  total  of  34  plausible  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  reported  in  mirabegron  patients  during  the 
clinical  development  (23  in  the  short-term  trials  and  11  during  the  long  term  trials).  Nonimmediate, 
primarily  cutaneous  hypersensitivity  reactions  of  urticaria,  leukocytoclastic  vasculitis,  rash,  pruritus, 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012

purpura, and lip and eyelid edema were reported including SAE of cutaneous vasculitis (1 patient) and 
urticaria  (2  patients).  An  association  of  mirabegron,  particularly  at  doses  >  100  mg,  with 
nonimmediate, primarily cutaneous reactions cannot be ruled out. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
The overall frequency of TEAE was generally higher in female patients compared with male patients 
across treatment groups. In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population and the EU/NA Long-term 
Controlled Population, although TEAE were generally reported more frequently in female patients 
compared with male patients across treatment groups, the difference from placebo or from tolterodine 
was generally similar between genders. Hypertension was the most frequently occurring TEAE in males 
and females in the total mirabegron group and reported with a greater frequency in males compared 
with females. The frequency of SAE and TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was 
similar in male and female patients across treatment groups. Female patients had generally larger 
changes in pulse rate consistent with their higher exposure following oral administration of mirabegron 
in the 12-week phase 3 studies, although this finding was inconsistent across treatment groups and 
AM/PM measurements. 
Age Group 1 (< 65 years, ≥65 years) 
In the 12-week and long-term studies, the overall frequency of TEAE was generally higher in patients 
≥ 65 years of age compared with patients < 65 years of age across treatment groups. The frequency 
of SAE and TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was lower in patients < 65 years 
of age compared with patients ≥ 65 years of age across treatment groups. No consistent trend of 
SBP/DBP change was evident in patients < 65 years of age compared with patients ≥ 65 years of age. 
In the 12-week studies, mean changes were generally similar in both age groups. In the long-term 
study, changes in morning and evening SBP were larger in patients ≥ 65 years and changes in AM and 
PM DBP were larger in patients < 65 years of age. This trend in the long-term study was seen in both 
the mirabegron and tolterodine treatment groups. 
Age Group 2 (< 75 years, ≥75 years) 
In the Global OAB 12-week Phase 2/3 Population, the frequency of TEAE was similar in patients < 75 
years of age and patients 75 years of age for the total mirabegron treatment group, but was 
numerically higher for patients ≥75 years in the tolterodine group. In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled 
Population, the frequency of TEAE was numerically higher in patients ≥ 75 years of age compared with 
patients < 75 years of age across treatment groups. In the 12-week and long-term studies, the 
frequency of SAE and TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was generally higher in 
patients ≥ 75 years of age compared with patients < 75 years of age for the total mirabegron group. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Tamsulosin 
The cardiovascular results from Study 178-CL-080 do not suggest a clinically relevant 
pharmacodynamic interaction between tamsulosin and mirabegron. In addition, combination treatment 
of mirabegron and tamsulosin did not appear to affect the safety profiles of either of these drugs. The 
higher exposure to tamsulosin following combination treatment of mirabegron and tamsulosin HCl 0.4 
mg is not reflected by an overt change in safety profile of tamsulosin. Similarly, the reduction of 
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012

exposure to mirabegron with combination administration of tamsulosin and mirabegron is not reflected 
by a change in safety profile in mirabegron. This is supported by the number of AE related to 
orthostasis showing a numerically similar frequency across treatments. There were also no SAE and no 
syncope events in either treatment arm during this study. 
CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Inhibitors [Study 178-CL-036] 
Administration of mirabegron (100 mg single dose) with the potent cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P 
glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily) in healthy volunteers resulted in higher 
mirabegron exposure (45% higher Cmax and 81% higher AUCinf).  
CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Inducers [Study 178-CL-070] 
The effects of rifampin 600 mg once daily on the pharmacokinetics of a single 100 mg dose of 
mirabegron were investigated. A 35% decrease in Cmax and a 44% decrease in AUCinf of mirabegron 
were observed. No dose adjustment is needed for mirabegron when administered with therapeutic 
doses of rifampin or other potent CYP3A4 or P-gp inducers. 
CYP2D6 Substrates [Study 178-CL-005 and 178-CL-058] 
In healthy volunteers, the inhibitory potency of mirabegron towards CYP2D6 is moderate and the 
CYP2D6 activity recovers over a period of 15 days. Multiple once daily dosing of 160 mg mirabegron IR 
resulted in a 90% increase in Cmax and a 229% increase in AUCinf of a single 100 mg dose of 
metoprolol. Multiple once daily dosing of mirabegron 100 mg resulted in a 79% increase in Cmax and a 
241% increase in AUCinf of a single 50 mg dose of desipramine. At 15 days after the last mirabegron 
dose, no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of desipramine was measured. Drugs that are 
CYP2D6 substrates are not expected to require dose adjustment when co-administered with 
mirabegron. Caution is advised if mirabegron is co-administered with medication with a narrow 
therapeutic index and significantly metabolized by CYP2D6. 
Digoxin [Study 178-CL-059] 
With multiple dosing of mirabegron 100 mg once daily the Cmax of a single 0.25 mg dose of digoxin 
increased 29%, while AUClast increased 27%. For patients who are initiating a combination of 
mirabegron and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should initially be prescribed. Serum digoxin 
concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired 
clinical effect. 
Solifenacin [Study 178-CL-069] 
Co-administration of solifenacin (10 mg) with mirabegron (100 mg once daily) was evaluated in 
healthy volunteers. Mean mirabegron Cmax was not impacted by concomitant solifenacin; however, 
mean solifenacin Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 23% and 26%, respectively with concomitant 
mirabegron. No dose adjustment is necessary for mirabegron when administered with solifenacin. 
Oral Contraceptives [Study 178-CL-068] 
With multiple dosing of mirabegron 100 mg once daily, no changes in the plasma concentrations of 
combined oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel; both CYP3A4 substrates) were 
observed.

With multiple dosing of mirabegron 100 mg once daily, no effects on the pharmacokinetics of R-
warfarin (substrate for CYP3A4) or S-warfarin (substrate for CYP2C9) or on prothrombin time were 
observed. No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when co-administered with mirabegron. 
CYP2D6 Inhibitors [Study 178-CL-005] 
In poor metabolisers for CYP2D6, used as a surrogate for CYP2D6 inhibition, mean Cmax and AUCinf of 
a single 160 mg dose of mirabegron IR were 14% and 19% higher than in extensive metabolizers, 
indicating that CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism has minimal impact on the mean plasma exposure to 
mirabegron. The interaction of mirabegron with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor was not studied. No dose 
adjustment is needed for mirabegron when administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or in patients who are 
CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. 
Metformin [Study 178-CL-006 and 178-CL-004] 
Co-administration of metformin (500 mg twice daily) with mirabegron IR (160 mg once daily) resulted 
in an approximate 20% decrease in mean Cmax and AUC of mirabegron. Multiple doses of mirabegron 
IR had no relevant effect on AUCtau and Cmax of metformin. No dose adjustment is needed when 
mirabegron is coadministered with therapeutic doses of metformin. In a 12-week study, in patients 
with diabetes mellitus, daily doses of mirabegron IR (up to 200 mg) in combination with metformin 
therapy had no effect on fasting plasma glucose levels or HbA1c in this patient population. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Global Phase 2/3 Population, one or more TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study 
drug was reported in 285/5863 (4.9%) mirabegron patients. The most common TEAE (by preferred 
term) leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were headache (20/5863 0.3%]), 
constipation (17/5863 [0.3%]) and hypertension (16/5863 [0.3%]). One or more drug-related TEAE 
leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was reported in 183/5863 (3.1%) mirabegron 
patients. The most common drug-related TEAE (by PT) leading to permanent discontinuation of study 
drug were headache (18/5863 [0.3%]), constipation (14/5863 [0.2%]) and hypertension (14/5863 
[0.2%]) One or more SAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was reported in 61/5863 
(1.0%) mirabegron patients. The most common SAE leading to permanent discontinuation of study 
drug were atrial fibrillation (3/5863 [0.1%]), liver function test abnormal (3/5863 [0.1%]) and 
prostate cancer (3/5863 [0.1%]).  
In the EU/NA Long-term Controlled Population, one or more TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The OAB safety database size is considered sufficiently self-standing for a proper safety evaluation. It 
is mainly based on exposure in 2858 OAB patients treated ≥ 12 weeks with mirabegron (1254 with the 
proposed 50 mg dosage) and 564 patients treated ≥12 months (294 with 50 mg). Additional data from 
a number of patients (n=345) from trials conducted in other indications (diabetes, LUTS) also offer 
further information to the general safety profile of the drug.  
Although middle-aged women constitute the preferential group of patients represented in the clinical 
development of mirabegron the database size allows the characterisation of most of the population. 
During the short term exposure, 53.4% of mirabegron patients reported TEAEs (55.2% placebo, 
60.2% of tolterodine). The most frequently reported were nasopharyngitis, hypertension and blood 
glucose increase that were similar for mirabegron, tolterodine and placebo. No dose dependent pattern 
was observed.  
For the intended 50 mg the reported incidences were naspharyngitis 7.4%, hypertension 5.2% and 
blood glucose increase 5.7%. Urinary sedment abnormal, (3.5%), CPK increased (3.3%), headache 
(3.1%), GGT increased (3%), constipation (2.1%), protein urine present (2.1%) and urinary tract 
infection (2%) were reported with lower frequency.  
Regarding the severe TEAEs the most frequent were supraventricular extrasystoles, headache and 
nasopharyngitis without relevant differences among treatments (included placebo). Hypertension, dry 
mouth (much more frequent with tolterodine) and constipation were the most frequently drug-related 
TEAEs, with a similar incidence among the groups. 
When looking at the long-term exposure, the percentage of patients with one or more TEAEs was 
60.5% for mirabegron and 62.6% for tolterodine patients. The adverse event pattern (TEAEs, severe 
TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs) was similar. 
There was an increase in the number of neoplasms in the mirabegron 100 mg group mainly due to 
subjects from study 178-CL-047, however the rates of the most frequent malignancies was similar to 
the age-adjusted population and it is considered biological implausible that the malignancies are linked 
to mirabegron as they were varied and no specific malignancy dominated. This explanation is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The overall incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was similar among treatment 
groups (including placebo). No qualitative differences both in short- and long-term exposed 
populations were observed. 
Overall 11 deaths occurred in the mirabegron development program. From the 5 patients treated with 
mirabegron 2 deaths were considered to be possibly due to mirabegron according to the investigator. 
Further, two of the deaths are noted to have occurred because of bladder cancer and cardiac failure. 
The narratives for these deaths were carefully assessed and don’t appear to be related to mirabegron. 
A total of 77 mirabegron-treated patients experienced at least 1 SAE in the OAB 12-week studies. No 
remarkable differences were observed among treatments (mirabegron 1.7%, tolterodine 1.7%, and 
placebo 1.8%). Similar incidences were reported for all mirabegron doses. More SAEs were reported 
after long-term treatment: Mirabegron 5.7% vs tolterodine 5.4%.

Beta-3 agonists were initially developed for the treatment of diabetes and beta 3-adrenoceptors (AR) 
are known to be present in adipose tissue. Mirabegron does not appear to have any relevant effect on 
blood glucose levels or body weight. Results from non clinical studies also show an effect of 
mirabegron on lipid metabolism. Results from studies in which mirabegron was administered to 
diabetic patients at doses of 60, 130 and 200 mg (much higher than those intended in OAB condition) 
did not show any significant change in the lipid parameters. During OAB clinical development blood 
glucose increase was reported for mirabegron (4.7%) with similar or higher incidences reported for 
tolterodine (7.6%) and placebo (5.4%). Therefore, a relevant effect on the lipid profile of OAB patients 
is not expected. 
A total of 34 plausible hypersensitivity reactions were reported in mirabegron patients during the 
clinical development (23 in the shor-term trials and 11 during the long term trials). Given that 
incidences of these events were 2-3 times higher with doses of mirabegron ≥ 100 mg than for 
tolterodine or placebo a potential relationship cannot be excluded. Hypersensitivity to the active 
substance or any of the excipients has been made contraindication in the SmPC and has been included 
as important identified risk into the RMP. 
Cardiovascular safety 
Clinical pharmacology studies carried out in healthy volunteers (CL-037, CL-072, CL-031) showed an 
increase of the heart rate and the blood pressure. Females and younger subjects were more 
susceptible to pulse increases whereas male had larger changes in blood pressure. These effects were 
influenced by the dose, being maximal at 200 mg. 
These findings were also observed in Phase II studies and partially determined the selection of doses 
to be tested in Phase 3 (where mirabegron 200 mg dose was discarded).  
During the Phase 3 development, cardiac arrhythmia events, mostly tachycardia, were more frequently 
reported with mirabegron than with placebo (1.8%). Mirabegron at doses up to 100 mg reported 
frequencies from 2.1% to 3.1%, being the highest for mirabegron 200 mg (6.6%). For the proposed 
50 mg dose only a modest not clinically significant, increment of pulse rate (1 bpm compared with 
placebo) and blood pressure (≤ 1 mm Hg compared to placebo) were reported. This effect was not 
translated into clinical adverse events (cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, and hypertension) distinct 
from those reported for tolterodine or in most of cases for placebo. Therefore the primary safety 
concern arising from these findings is a risk of increased heart rate in patients who are exposed to 
doses that are greater than or equal to the supratherapeutic dose of mirabegron 100 mg. 
The SmPC indicates to reduce the dose to 25 mg daily in patients with renal or hepatic impairment who 
are at risk for higher exposure at the therapeutic dose of 50 mg. Furthermore it is clearly labeled that 
increases in mirabegron exposure due to drug interactions may be associated with increases in pulse 
rate. Post marketing data on increased heart rate and tachycardia among initiators of mirabegron and 
comparator drugs indicated for OAB will be generated within a PASS, as detailed in the RMP. 
In the TQT studies the effect of repeat oral dosing of mirabegron at 50 mg and two supra-therapeutic 
doses (100 and 200 mg) on the QTcI interval was evaluated. The supra-therapeutic doses represent 
approximately 2.6- and 6.5-fold the exposure of the therapeutic dose, respectively. At a mirabegron 
dose of 200 mg, the QTcI interval did not exceed 10 msec at any time point in males, while in females 
exceeded the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval did exceed 10 msec between 0.5–
6 hours, with a maximum difference from placebo at 5 hours where the mean effect was 10.42 msec 
(upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI 13.44 msec). At the mirabegron 100 mg dose QTc interval 
changes were below 10 msec, although females showed greater mean change differences than males. 
Mirabegron 50 mg dose did have no remarkable effect on QTc interval (males and females).

Results from a PK/PD analysis indicate a small effect of age on mirabegron exposure (about 11%). 
When the simulations considered the additive effect of moderate renal impairment, mild hepatic 
impairment or the concomitant treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) changes in 
mirabegron exposure remained being relatively small. In any case, plasma concentrations for 
mirabegron 50 mg do not reach the exposure observed with the 100 mg dose. However data from an 
ad hoc Pk/PD analysis conducted by the Applicant showed maximal ddQTc values of 500.4 msec (95th 
percentile) in the simulation group of 75 year old females with mild renal impairment, mild hepatic 
impairment and taking ketoconazole). Therefore circumstances of mild and moderate renal impairment 
or mild hepatic impairment, each combined with the intake of a strong CYP3A4inhibitor, are taken into 
account in the SmPC recommending a dose reduction to 25 mg. The use of mirabegron concomitantly 
with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in patients with severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic 
impairment is not recommended. 
Clinical trials in OAB population were mainly composed by females (> 70%) with a median age about 
60 years (35% ≥ 65 years). Analysis of the effect of mirabegron on QTc in Phase 2/3 studies did not 
show any signal of concern on QT for 50 mg or 100 mg dose. Changes observed (and also when 
gender or age were considered) were similar to those reported for placebo. 
In conclusion mirabegron 50 mg dose does not appear to raise safety concerns related to the potential 
QT prolongation when factors such as gender or age (which may influence the exposure to 
mirabegron) are considered. However, in patients receiving the therapeutic dose of mirabegron 50 mg 
once daily who have a known history of QT prolongation or who are concurrently taking medications 
known to prolong QT interval a safety concern arises. Adequate warnings have been included into the 
SmPC. Furthermore, the planned post authorisation safety study will generate further data on the 
cardiovascular safety particularly in the elderly, as specified in the risk management plan.  
A decrease of lymphocytes and/or neutrophils counts was reported (greater with higher doses) after 
both short and long- term exposure to mirabegron. It is acknowledged by the CHMP that these 
changes were modest and transient however a group of patients receiving 100 mg (two times the 
proposed dose) achieved the clinical threshold of grade 2. This may be due to the presence of 
decreased (or borderline) values at baseline for a number of patients and whereas it is acknowledged 
that data for mirabegron 50 mg are not object of concern for the decrease of lymphocytes a potential 
effect (at least with higher doses) cannot be considered totally discarded. In order to properly address 
this issue it was included into the RMP as important missing information. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The available safety data is adequate to characterise the safety profile of mirabegron for the intended 
indication and the proposed patient population. Overall, the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron 
show a favourable safety profile comparable to that commonly reported with antimuscarinic agents. 
The potential for hypersensitivity reactions with mirabegron and exipients is adequately reflected in the 
SmPC.  
For the 50 mg dose small increments in pulse rate and blood pressure have been observed within the 
clinical development programme. This effect was not translated into clinical adverse events (cardiac 
arrhythmia, tachycardia, and hypertension) distinct from those reported for tolterodine or in most of 
cases for placebo. Further mirabegron 50 mg dose does not appear to raise safety concerns related to

the potential QT prolongation when factors such as gender or age (which may influence the exposure 
to mirabegron) are considered. To prevent increases in mirabegron exposure and subsequent 
prolongation of the QTc interval due to drug interactions appropriate warnings have been included into 
the SmPC. Furthermore, the risk management plan specifies specific pharmacovigilance activites to 
further characterise the cardiovascular safety profile. This includes the conduct of a Post-authorisation 
Safety Study focusing on CV safety, especially in elederly patients. The protocol for this study will be 
provided for agreement and follow-up reporting will be performed, as specified in the Risk Management 
Plan. 
The CHMP agrees to calculate the PSUR cycle based on the IBD. Therefore the first DLP for the PSUR 
submission will be 30 June 2013.

In healthy volunteers, the inhibitory potency of mirabegron 
towards CYP2D6 is moderate and the CYP2D6 activity 
recovers within 15 days after discontinuation of mirabegron. 
Multiple once daily dosing of mirabegron IR resulted in a 90% 
increase in C max and a 229% increase in AUC of a single dose 
of metoprolol. Multiple once daily dosing of mirabegron 
resulted in a 79% increase in C max and a 241% increase in

Caution is advised if mirabegron is co-administered with 
medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index and 
significantly metabolized by CYP2D6, such as thioridazine, 
Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., flecainide, propafenone), and 
tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, desipramine). 
Caution is also advised if mirabegron is co-administered with 
CYP2D6 substrates that are individually dose titrated.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the main clinical studies a statistically superior effect in comparison to placebo was shown for the 
co-primary endpoints. The pooled data from the three main studies showed after 12 weeks of 
treatment that the effect in terms of urinary frequency was -1.75 micturitions for the 50 mg dose 
versus -1.20 micturitions for placebo. Likewise, the effect of mirabegron on incontinence (assessed in a 
subset of the recruited population) was -1.49 incontinence episodes for the 50 mg dose versus -1.10 
for placebo. When the effect was expressed in responder analyses mirabegron achieves equal or less 
than 10% responders more than placebo. Data for most of the secondary endpoints support this 
efficacy. 
Patient-reported outcomes reported a positive trend in most of the domains, even if the size effect is 
not impressive. It is noteworthy that the perception of the patients is especially significant in such a 
non-life threatening condition to provide reassurance of the clinical relevance of the changes measured 
in the quantitative outcomes.  
Reassurance on the efficacy of mirabegron can also be obtained from the double and triple responder 
rate analyses based on predefined minimal important differences where mirabegron was significantly 
better than placebo. It is of special relevance, that this has also been observed when a more stringent 
definition of responder was used.  
Indirect comparison of the effect observed with mirabegron 50 mg on the co-primary endpoint 
(incontinence and micturitions) with products licensed in this condition shows that the effect of 
mirabegron is within the range of the mean values for the other products.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706651/2012

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Long-term efficacy data of mirabegron are limited. Available data have been measured as secondary 
endpoints and the main evidence comes from the non-formal comparison between mirabegron (50 mg 
and 100 mg) and tolterodine. Although the results obtained at 12 months do not suggest a loss of 
efficacy, these data do not allow for sound conclusions regarding the maintenance of the effect of 
mirabegron. However in the comparative review from publicly available sources mirabegron does not 
show a distinct behaviour from other medicinal products approved for that condition (i.e. 
antimuscarinic drugs). In this respect, comparative effects of mirabegron with tolterodine help to put in 
context the results as the comparison reveals an effect of similar magnitude both in short and long (52 
weeks) term treatment. The uncertainty with regard to long-term data specific for mirabegron is 
therefore acceptable at this point in time. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall mirabegron shows a comparable safety profile with respect to that commonly reported with 
antimuscarinics. The most frequently reported AEs with the intended 50 mg dosage were 
nasopharyngitis, hypertension, blood glucose increase, urinary sediment abnormal, CPK increased, 
headache, GGT increased, constipation, protein urine present, and urinary tract infection (2%). In 
general the incidences reported were similar to the ones for tolterodine and placebo.  
Some cases of hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during the clinical development. Given 
that these events were 2-3 times higher with doses of mirabegron ≥ 100 mg than for tolterodine or 
placebo a potential relationship cannot be excluded. Therefore hypersensitivity to the active substance 
or any of the excipients has been added as a contraindication in the SmPC and has been included as 
important identified risk into the RMP. 
With regard to cardiovascular safety, mirabegron at the proposed 50 mg dose shows a modest 
increment of pulse rate and blood pressure (1 bpm and ≤ 1 mm Hg compared with placebo). These 
effects appear to be dose dependant (up to 100 mg 2.1% to 3.1%, 200 mg 6.6%) and superior to 
placebo (1.8%). Adequate safety warnings with regards to arterial hypertension and tachycardia have 
been included into the SmPC. Concerning the potential effect on the QT interval the 50 mg dose was 
shown to be reasonably safe in the thorough QT studies and as well in the clinical development 
program. The SmPC contains adequate information regarding the observations related to 
cardiovascular safety. Furthermore, the RMP requires the conduct of a post-authorisation safety study 
to further explore the CV safety particularly in the elderly, as detailed in the RMP. The posology of the 
drug takes possible higher exposure due to impaired hepatic or renal impairment or due to the 
influence of relevant drug interactions into account and relevant safety warning for the use of 
mirabegron in these conditions and with regards to patients taking drugs with narrow therapeutic 
indices metabolized via CYP2D6 or P-gp have been included into the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Based on findings during the development of mirabegron increased blood pressure and QT prolongation 
were considered important potential risks that merit further assessment of cardiovascular safety in a 
real-life setting, especially in elderly patients. 
For the authorisation of this medicinal product these uncertainties are addressed by adequate risk 
management strategies and warnings in the Product Information. Further, as described above,

initiators of the treatment, especially elderly patients, with mirabegron will be monitored within a PASS 
for their cardiovascular parameters. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overactive bladder is a chronic condition with an increased prevalence in advanced ages. It adversely 
impact on quality of life derived from the psychological and life-style consequences of the condition. 
Urinary tract infection, skin ulceration and a greater risk of fall and bone fractures in some reports 
have been described among the complications.  
Mirabegron represents a new alternative in the treatment of this condition with a new mechanism of 
action. It has shown a significant effect in the main symptoms of overactive bladder.The reduction in 
the frequency of micturitions, in the number of episodes of incontinence, the volume voided per 
micturition or urgency episodes has been considered to be modest in terms of clinical relevance, 
although comparable to other agents approved for this indication. The results of the measures aimed 
at capturing the subjective perception of the benefit reflect also these findings. 
Mirabegron appears to be well tolerated. In terms of cardiovascular safety a modest increment of pulse 
rate and blood pressure at the proposed 50 mg dose was shown. This risk is considered addressed with 
the relevant SmPC wordings and implemented RMP risk minimisation strategies. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The available data indicate that except for the fact that mirabegron belongs to a new therapeutic class 
it falls within what is expected from other products authorised for the treatment of overactive bladder 
symptoms (i.e. antimuscarinics) with an acceptable safety profile. The overall benefit-risk balance is 
considered positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
A consistent effect is observed in favour to mirabegron. The comparison with tolterodine (and 
indirectly, with other antimuscarinics) reveals an effect of similar magnitude in the quantitative 
measures and also when patients valued the subjective impact. The safety profile is comparable to that 
commonly reported with antimuscarinics and can be considered to be balanced through the relevant 
SmPC wordings and risk minimisation measures. Therefore, the effect, although modest, can be 
considered clinically relevant and sufficient to conclude on the positive benefit-risk balance of this 
medicinal product in the treatment of OAB.  
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Betmiga in the treatment of urgency, increased micturition frequency 
and/or urgency incontinence as may occur in adult patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is

I.INTRODUCTION 
On February 27, 2013 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Gardasil in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. The 
MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Gardasil and that 
there is not a consequential regulatory action. 
However, in the Preliminary assessment report of this study the Rapporteur stated that the paediatric 
procedure  was  not  fulfilled  until  a  satisfactory  clarification  regarding the  identified  protocol  violations 
was received. Additional clarifications were requested. 
According to this request the MAH has now provided a clarification to the identified protocol violation.  
In summary the following background data were discussed in the Preliminary assessment report.  
II.SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The same formulation as the commercial formulation was used in the study.  
Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
The MAH had submitted a final report for: 
- 
V501-046  Evaluation  of  Safety  and  Immunogenicity  of  GARDASIL™  in  Healthy  Females 
Between 9 and 26 Years of Age in Sub Saharan Africa; 
2. Clinical study 
V501-046  Evaluation  of  Safety  and  Immunogenicity  of  GARDASIL™  in  Healthy  Females 
Between 9 and 26 Years of Age in Sub Saharan Africa;(Phase A) 
  Description 
Methods 
  Objectives 
Immunogenicity:  To  estimate  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  seroconvert  to  each  of  HPV  6, 
11, 16, and 18 at Month 7 (4 weeks Postdose 3) 
  Safety:  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  GARDASIL  in  females  9-  26  years  of  age  in 
Sub Saharan Africa 
•  Study design 
            Protocol 046 was conducted in two phases. 
-  Primary phase: the base study of immunogenicity and safety 
-  Vaccination of placebo subject

Treatments 
Subjects received one 0.5-mL intramuscular dose of GARDASIL or placebo at Day 1, Month 2, 
and Month 6. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity:  The  primary  endpoint  of  interest  in  this  study  was  the  percentages  of 
GARDASIL recipients who seroconvert to each of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 at Week 4 Postdose 3. 
Safety:  The  primary  safety  objective  was  to  demonstrate  that  GARDASIL  was  generally  well 
tolerated when administered in a 3-dose regimen. 
  Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity:  The  primary  hypothesis  was  the  percentage  of  subjects  receiving  GARDASIL 
who seroconvert to each of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 at week 4 Postdose 3 was acceptable. 
Safety:  Safety  and  tolerability  were  assessed  by  clinical  review  of  all  relevant  parameters 
including adverse experiences (AEs). 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  257  subjects  were  screened  for  inclusion  in  this  study  and  250  subjects  were 
randomized.  The  disposition  of  subjects  from  Day  1  to  Month  7  by  age  strata  is  presented  in 
Table 10-1. Among the 250 randomized subjects, a total of 27 subjects (10.8%) discontinued 
during the study period Day 1 through Month 7. 
Among the 27 subjects discontinued subjects: 
– Eighteen (18) randomized subjects were discontinued due to a protocol violation. 
– Eight (8) subjects were lost to follow-up. 
– One (1) subject withdrew consent. 
– None of the subjects randomized were discontinued prior to their first vaccination. 
– No subject discontinued due to an adverse event. 
A  total  of  224  subjects  (89.6%)  completed  the  3  study  vaccinations  regimen,  including  207 
subjects who received GARDASIL and 17 subjects who received placebo. Many subjects in the 
9  to12  year  old  age  group  have  unknown  Protocol  Milestone  status  because  there  was 
randomization to GARDASIL or placebo and enrollment to Phase B had not been initiated at the 
time of this database lock.

Assessor’s comment: The protocol violations were explained in the CSR, and were due to either subject 
consented  by  legal  guardian  without  legal guardianship  documentation  (N=18)  or  subjects  not  native 
to  Sub  Saharan  Africa  (N=7)  (one  subject  had  both  protocol  violations,  i.e.  24  subjects  were 
excluded). It is unclear why only 18+5=23 subjects are included in the table 10-1 as excluded due to 
protocol  violations,  and  what  the  difference  between  Study  Disposition  and  Study  Medication 
Disposition  is.  The  Applicant  is  asked  to  explain  the  discrepancy  between  Table  10-1  and  the  list  of 
protocol violations in the CSR.  
 
Immunogenicity results 
Overall,  100%  of  the  subjects  seroconverted  by  Week  4  Postdose  3,  in  all  populations  (all  age 
strata and the All Type-Specific Naïve subjects with serology population), for each of the 4 HPV 
types  summarized.  The  results  support  the  results  in  the  per  protocol  immunogenicity 
population. 
•  Safety results 
The adverse events reported in this study are in agreement with data from previously reported 
studies and no new safety signal was raised in this study 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The current study included healthy Sub Saharan girls and women 9-26 years. The study results were in 
agreement  with  results  from  previously  assessed  studies  in  the  same  age groups  from  other  parts of 
the  world.  The  immune  responses  are  considered  robust,  and  the  safety  profile  did  not  raise  further 
questions. The study is continuing into phase B, i.e. vaccination of the placebo group, and a report of 
that phase is expected when available as a separated article 46 procedure. However, a clarification is 
requested regarding the number of subjects excluded due to protocol violations in the study. 
III.CLARIFICATION TO THE QUESTION POSED BY THE RAPPORTEUR IN THE 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT REPORT 
Based on the data submitted the MAH was requested to provide a response to the following question 
as part of this procedure P 46 072. The MAH has accordingly presented the requested clarification.

1 Rapporteur Additional Clarification requested: 
The protocol violations were explained in the CSR, and were due to either subject consented by legal 
guardian  without  legal  guardianship  documentation  (N=18)  or  subjects  not  native  to  Sub  Saharan 
Africa  (N=7)  (one  subject  had  both  protocol  violations,  i.e.  24  subjects  were  excluded).  It  is  unclear 
why only 18+5=23 subjects are included in the table 10-1 as excluded due to protocol violations, and 
what  the  difference  between  Study  Disposition  and  Study  Medication  Disposition  is.  The  Applicant  is 
asked to explain the discrepancy between Table 10-1 and the list of protocol violations in the CSR. 
2  MAH Response:  
The  MAH  would  first  like  to  provide  clarification  about  the  data  in  the  subject  disposition  table 
including:  explaining  the  difference  between  Study  Disposition  and  Study  Medication  Disposition  and 
clarifying that 18 subjects (not 23) had discontinued the study by Month 7 due to protocol violations. 
(Of  note,  Month  7  is  the  final  visit  for  this  CSR,  the  study  continued  after  Month  7.)  The  MAH  would 
then like to clarify the difference between protocol violators on the subject disposition table and those 
on the protocol violator list. 
 Subject Disposition Table Clarifications  
The  subject  disposition  table  includes  two  related  sections:  Study  Disposition  and  Study  Medication 
Disposition.  The  Study  Disposition  section  includes  subjects  who  discontinued  from  the  study  prior to 
the final scheduled visit (i.e., subjects who discontinued at or before the Month 7, the final scheduled 
visit for this CSR). These subjects may or may not have completed vaccination per protocol. The Study 
Medication  Disposition  section  includes  subjects  who  discontinued  study  medication  early  (i.e., 
reported  as  not  completing  all  3  doses  of  vaccine).  (Typically  subjects  who  discontinue  study 
medication early are a subset of subjects who discontinue from the study early).  The 5 subjects who 
appear as discontinuing study medication due to protocol violation are a subset of the 18 subjects who 
discontinued  the  study  due  to  a  protocol  violation,  i.e.,  only  18  subjects  (not  23)  are  listed  as 
discontinuing  the  study  due  to  protocol  violation  at  the  time  point  for  this  CSR  (Month  7).  These  18 
subjects are the subjects with the protocol violation of ‘legal guardianship documentation.’ 
 Subject Disposition Table vs. Protocol Violator List  
The  MAH  would  like  to  clarify  that  the  Subject  Disposition  table  (Table  10-1,  enclosed)  only 
specifies  the  number  of  subjects  (18)  who,  by  Month  7,  reported  discontinuing  the 
study/study  medication  due  to  a  protocol  violation.  This  table  does  not  provide  a 
comprehensive  accounting  of  subjects  who  were  excluded  from  the  primary  analysis  due  to 
protocol violation. Twenty-four (24) subjects were excluded from the primary analysis due to 
protocol violation (see Table 14-2 enclosed).  
The reason there is an apparent discrepancy in number of subjects between Table 10-1 (18) and the 
list  of  protocol  violations  (24)  is  that  6  subjects  continued  to  be  followed  for  safety  after  Month  7. 
These are the 6 subjects who only had protocol violation of ‘not native to Sub Saharan Africa.’ Thus, 
they appear on Protocol Violators table (as they were excluded from immunogenicity analysis) but do 
not appear as discontinued due to protocol violation on Table 10-1 (as they continued in the study and 
were followed for safety).

IV.  RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
•  Overall conclusion 
The MAH has satisfactorily explained how to interpret the information regarding the protocol violations. 
The subject disposition and the protocol violation are accepted. 
The  provided  explanation,  such  as  the  graphic  representation  would,  however,  have  been  helpful 
already in the original presentation.   
  Recommendation  
  Fulfilled –  
No further action required

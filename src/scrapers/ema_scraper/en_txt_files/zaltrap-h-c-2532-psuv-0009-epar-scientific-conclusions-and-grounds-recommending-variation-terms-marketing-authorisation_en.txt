Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Zaltrap, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
Six out of 10 cases of medication errors concerned the omission of a micro-filter, the use of a micro-filter 
with a pore size other than 0.2 micron or use of a filter made of a material other than indicated in the 
SmPC.  The  number  of  cases  reporting  a  medication  error  relating  to  filter  use  is  relatively  low. 
Information regarding the use of a filter, including its pore size and material, is currently included in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. However, in order to target those involved in the reconstitution/preparation of 
the product for administration, this information is recommended to be moved from section 4.2 to section 
6.6 of the SmPC and to include instead a cross reference to section 6.6 in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding aflibercept regarding medication errors related to the filter 
use, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Zaltrap, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance aflibercept is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

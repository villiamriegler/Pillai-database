2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This Type II variation seeks approval for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adult 
patients. In total there are 2 studies in the Pfizer clinical development program for AS provided in this 
application: Study A3921119, a completed Phase 2, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled dose-ranging, parallel group efficacy and safety study designed to characterize the dose-
response of tofacitinib in patients with active AS; and Study A3921120, a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-
controlled, and double-blind study in adult patients with active AS. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
AS is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease primarily affecting the sacroiliac joints and spine and is 
part of the family of related SpA disorders, which also includes PsA. AS or radiographic axial SpA is 
defined by the presence of definitive radiographic sacroiliitis based upon 1984 Modified New York 
classification criteria. AS causes chronic inflammation at the insertion of ligaments and tendons in the 
axial skeleton (entheses) and may progress from inflammation in the sacroiliac joints to sacroiliac and 
spine ankylosis over time. AS is also associated with peripheral arthritis, and enthesitis, and extra-
articular manifestations such as anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and IBD. Osteoporosis is a common AS 
comorbidity. AS is often present for many years before it is diagnosed and typically presents in people 
between 20 and 40 years of age, with a higher prevalence in males, leading to back pain, stiffness, 
fatigue, progressive disability and adverse effects on health-related quality of life. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication for tofacitinib oral IR tablet 5 and 10 mg BID is for the treatment of active AS in 
adult patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The incidence and prevalence of AS for a range of countries and geographical regions are provided in Table 
1: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 10/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The highest incidence rates have been reported in Northern Europe and North America, while the lowest 
have been reported in Asia and Iceland (Table 1). The reported prevalence across geographic regions 
follows a similar trend to the reported incidence. Mortality rates among patients with AS are 1.5 times 
higher than the general population, due to respiratory complications, and consequences from spinal 
fractures and other fractures. 
Studies consistently report that AS occurs more frequently among men than women. One study in the 
United States reported a four-fold higher incidence in men than women and a similar difference in 
incidence rates between men and women was reported in the Czech Republic. the prevalence reported 
among men is also similarly higher than the prevalence reported among women. Studies report a male to 
female 
ratio ranging from 1.2-9 to 1. 
AS usually starts in the second or third decade of life, with peak incidence occurring in the 20 to 34 age 
group. Studies report that the average age at onset of symptoms is between 20.9 and 32.5 years, while 
the average age of diagnosis is later, between 24.2 and 39.8 years. 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Overall,  the  pathogenesis  of  AS  is  not  well  characterised  but  seems  to  include  both  genetic  and 
environmental components, which combine to elicit a chronic inflammatory response involving the innate 
and adaptive immune systems. A genetic link was noted in that 90 - 95% of white Western European people 
with  AS  are  positive  for  the  HLA-B27  allele,  and  risk  increases  with  HLA-B27-positive  relatives. 
Environmental factors, such as infections and mechanical stress at the entheses, have been postulated as 
being potential triggers of AS in genetically susceptible individuals. In AS, these entheseal stresses might 
activate downstream events that lead to inflammation, bone erosion and spur formation. 
Key aspects of the pathology and pathogenesis of AS are listed below: 
• 
• 
In the earlier stages of the disease, AS primarily involves inflammation of the entheses (enthesitis) 
in the axial skeleton (mainly the sacroiliac joints) and bone erosion in the vertebral bodies; 
In  the  later  stages  of  the disease,  syndesmophyte  (spur)  formation  and  then  fusion  of  adjacent 
vertebral  bodies  and  syndesmophytes  occur.  These  processes  appear  to  be  uncoupled  from 
inflammation; 
•  The development of AS is associated with specific genes; the most important is HLAB27; additional 
genes associated with AS include ERAP1, IL-23R, ANTXR2, and IL- R2; 
•  Key innate and adaptive immune cells involved in the initiation, progression, and modulation of 
inflammation in AS include dendritic cells, macrophages, NK cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th17 cells, 
Th22 cells, Treg cells, and T CD8+ cells. There may be a limited role for B cells. 
•  These innate and adaptive immune cells secrete a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
implicated in the pathogenesis of AS including IL-1, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17 IL- 22, IL-23, 
IFNγ and TNFalpha. 
Confirmation that TNFaplha (secreted by Th1 and T CD8+ cells) and IL-17 (secreted by Th17 and T CD8+ 
cells) contribute to the pathogenesis of AS has been provided by the efficacy of interventions such as 
TNFi and anti-IL-17 mAb. These biologic therapies directly inhibit the effect of 1 cytokine pathway. 
Tofacitinib, a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, interferes directly (eg, IL-23) or indirectly (eg, TNFalpha, 
IL-17) with the signalling of multiple AS-associated cytokines. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 11/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tofacitinib therapy therefore has the potential to suppress the articular, as well as the extraarticular 
manifestations of AS, without the drug-induced immunogenicity and antidrug neutralising antibody 
formation seen with long-term monoclonal antibody use. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
There are no specific diagnostic tests or biomarkers for the diagnosis of AS. For the purpose of clinical trials, 
consistent with the EMA clinical guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment 
of  Axial  Spondyloarthritis,  the  classification  criteria  based  on  the  1984  Modified  New  York  Criteria  for 
Ankylosing Spondylitis is used to define AS if the radiological criterion (pelvic radiograph) is associated with 
at least 1 clinical criterion. In the Phase 2 dose-ranging Study A3921119 and the Phase 3 pivotal Study 
A3921120, in addition to the above Modified New York criteria, a patient must have had active AS defined 
as a BASDAI score of ≥4 and a back pain score (BASDAI Question 2) of ≥4 at both screening and baseline 
in order to be included. 
Management 
For many decades, the mainstay of treatment of AS has been NSAIDs and structured exercise programs 
including physical therapy with the aim of relieving clinical symptoms. However, gastrointestinal and 
other adverse effects limit the tolerability of NSAIDs including some COX-2 selective inhibitors. In 
addition, AS patients report insufficient control with NSAIDs alone. Treatment with csDMARDs that have 
shown efficacy in RA have not shown similar efficacy in AS. Sulfasalazine may provide some benefits for 
peripheral arthritis but does not impact axial disease. Locally administered parenteral glucocorticoids are 
also a treatment option for patients with active enthesitis, sacroiliitis or peripheral arthritis that have not 
responded fully to NSAID therapy. However, although local corticosteroid injections are widely used in 
clinical practice to good effect in AS patients, no clinical trials exist to support this use. TNFα antagonists 
or inhibitors, also known as TNFi, have demonstrated efficacy and are approved for the reduction of 
clinical signs and symptoms, in patients with AS. A recent ASAS recommendation stated that TNFi 
therapy is indicated for those patients with persistently high disease activity despite conventional 
treatment. Additional bDMARDs that inhibit IL-17, secukinumab and ixekizumab, have been subsequently 
approved in the US and EU. However, there is a substantial proportion of patients who have an 
inadequate response to each of these bDMARDs and as such therapy options are administered 
parenterally, this may act as an additional barrier to their use. Moreover, the long-term efficacy of some 
TNFi and IL-17i mAb may be limited by immunogenicity. Moreover, recently, also another JAK inhibitor 
(Upadacitinib) has been authorized in EU for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adult 
patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. 
Current updates to the ASAS-EULAR axial SpA management recommendations provide initial therapy 
recommendations based upon an individual’s disease activity the patient characteristics including 
comorbidities and psychosocial factors. Based on the current evidence and the considerations of ASAS 
and EULAR, NSAIDs and TNFi remain the primary classes of medications for the treatment of axial SpA 
(including AS). Sulfasalazine is considered only for the treatment of peripheral arthritis. IL-17i are 
recommended for patients with active disease in whom TNFi are contraindicated, and in primary 
nonresponders to TNFi. The use of IL-17i should be avoided in patients with active IBD, as TNFi 
monoclonal antibodies are better options.  
Treatments are available to control and delay the progression of symptoms of AS. However, additional 
therapy options are still needed as up to 50% of patients with AS continue to have active disease despite 
treatment with NSAIDs or biological agents. 
The use of NSAIDs is limited by gastrointestinal and other adverse events. Other effective agents for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 12/215 
 
 
 
 
treatment of active AS are bDMARDs, which require parenteral administration and may be limited by loss 
of efficacy, often due to immunogenicity. Of note, in a recent survey of patients receiving injectable 
bDMARDs to treat PsA, a condition related to AS, 54% found the therapy to be burdensome, with fear of 
injections and inconvenience amongst the most commonly reported reasons. Accordingly, there is a need 
for an oral tsDMARD with similar efficacy to bDMARDs for the treatment of AS. 
As a number of genes and cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AS, it is likely that the 
etiology of AS is complex and has a plethora of underlying contributory factors. This implies that 
additional treatment options with mechanisms of action distinct from those currently available, such as 
tofacitinib, are needed as options for different AS patients.  
In summary, despite the advances that have been made in the last decade in the treatment of AS, a 
significant number of patients with AS still have active disease and remain refractory to currently 
available pharmacotherapies. Unmet medical need therefore remains for a new effective oral DMARD with 
a new MOA that provides a favourable benefit-risk profile and broadens the treatment options for adult 
patients with AS to achieve and sustain clinical benefit. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Mode of action. 
Tofacitinib is a selective JAK inhibitor, with a high degree of selectivity against other kinases in the human 
genome. In kinase assays, tofacitinib inhibits JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent tyrosine kinase 2 
(TYK2). In cellular settings where JAK kinases signal in pairs, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits signalling 
by heterodimeric receptors associated with JAK3 and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity over receptors 
that signal via pairs of JAK2. Accordingly, tofacitinib may result in modulation of the adaptive and innate 
immune response in IBD and may, therefore, be effective in interrupting the chronic cycle of GI 
inflammation. 
Pharmacological classification. 
Tofacitinib belongs to the therapeutic group of Immunosuppressants (L04) and its therapeutic subgroup is 
L04AA29 
Previously approved indications 
Xeljanz® was approved in the EU at a dose of 5 mg BID (IR film-coated tablets approved on 22 Mar 
2017; RA MAA (EMEA/H/C/004214/0000) as monotherapy or in combination with MTX in adult patients 
with moderate to severe active RA, who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to 1 or more 
DMARDs.  
On 25 Jun 2018, tofacitinib was approved in the EU at a dose of 5 mg BID in combination with MTX, in 
adult patients with active PsA, who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to a previous DMARD 
treatment (EMEA/H/C/004214/II/0006). Furthermore, tofacitinib was approved in the EU at a dose of 5 
mg and 10 mg IR BID (26 Jul 2018; EMEA/H/C/004214/X/0005/G) for the treatment of adult patients 
with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were 
intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent.  
An extension application to introduce a new pharmaceutical form (prolonged-release tablet) associated 
with a new strength (11 mg), was approved on 16/12/2019 (EMEA/H/C/004214/X/0012)

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development program plans for the treatment of AS generally reflects the CHMP Guideline on 
the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Axial Spondyloarthritis 
(EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 1). However, in certain instances the guideline has not been 
strictly adhered. For example, regarding the choice of ASAS20 as primary endpont the guideline states 
that “although the percentage of patients reaching an ASAS 20 response has been accepted as primary 
endpoint for a number of products, a higher magnitude of the clinical response are expected for biological 
medicinal products or products from a new therapeutic class. Thus, the ASAS 40 response criteria would 
be the preferred primary endpoint”. The MAH reports to have used ASA20 as primary endpoint, with the 
EMA preferred ASAS40 endpoint as a key secondary endpoint, also based on interactions occurred with 
the FDA that informed the design of the Phase 3 program and content of the AS sNDA submission (the 
MAH has not sought scientific advice from the EMA or national member states in relation to the 
development of Xeljanz for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis but has sought advice from the US 
FDA). 
Summary of Meeting Correspondence with FDA: 
Key interactions between Pfizer and the FDA for the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) program under IND 70903 
have been provided (Table 2).

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been submitted by the MAH as part of this application for 
seeking approval for a new indication (treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adult patients). 
For the treatment of AS, the maximum recommended dosage of Xeljanz is 5 mg twice daily (IR tablet) or 
10 mg once daily (IR).  
Tofacitinib  has  a  log  D  value  <4.5  at  all  environmentally  relevant  pHs.  Screening  for  Persistence, 
Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) is not required. 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration in Surface Water (PECsw) Annual consumption 
of tofacitinib in the EU member states over the 12-month period from 1Q2019 through 4Q2019 was 
obtained from the IQVIA™ [formerly the Intercontinental Marketing Services (IMS)], the Health 
Management Integrity and Data Assessment System (MIDAS) database (Appendix 1). Based on these

data, total annual consumption in the EU is 117.4 kg and includes patient use of tofacitinib for treatment 
of the approved indications, RA, PsA and UC. The highest consumption per inhabitant was found in 
Luxembourg, therefore the data from Luxembourg will be used to determine the most conservative 
consumption based Fpen. As per the ERA Guideline1 , the Fpen based on consumption is determined as 
follows:

EMA/CHMP/743175/2021

The PECsw value is greater than the 0.01 g/L action limit. Based on the PECsw value, a Phase II 
environmental fate and effects analysis for tofacitinib is required. 
PHASE II – TIER A: PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, ENVIRONMENTALFATE AND EFFECTS ANALYSIS 
The PECsurfacewater was not refined for human metabolism and excretion, for removal during wastewater 
treatment or for biodegradation in the water-sediment environment. In this conservative estimate, the PEC 
is more than 4 orders of magnitude less than the lowest chronic NOEC obtained with fish. In addition, the 
PEC/PNEC values for surface water (2 x 10-4), groundwater (3.1 x 10-5), micro-organisms (5.8 x 10-6) 
and  sediment  dwelling  organisms  (1.9  x  10-2),  are  all  significantly  below  the  respective  action  limits, 
therefore it may be concluded that tofacitinib will not present an environmental risk following patient use. 
No environmental concerns are apparent. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
PECsw calculation was made by the MAH by summing up the PECsw of all indications, Fpen refinement 
was made by taking into consideration the annual consumption for the already approved indications (RA, 
PsA and UC). This is made for renewal applications, as per ERA guideline.  
In case of a type II variation, specifically the addition of a new indication, the Fpen should be refined by 
submitting European disease prevalence data for the sought indication. Such data should be published by 
a reliable and independent source, as per ERA Q&A.  
Moreover, a PECsw of all indications was made by summing up the already approved and the new one. 
Also, the PECsw of the sought indications only have to be summed to reach the PECsurface water that will 
be used in the ERA, as per ERA Q&A.  
In light of these considerations, as the present submission was dealing with a type II variation, the MAH 
was asked to recalculate the PECsw for the new indication (SA) only, and to refine the Fpen by submitting 
EU prevalence data, as per ERA Q&A. For the new indication, AS, the default Fpen value of 0.01 was used 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 16/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to calculate the PECsw of 0.055 μg/L, as per ERA guideline and Q&A documents. Fpen from Luxembourg 
was used for the previosly approved ones. Therefore, the Fpen from this member state was used for 
PECsw of 0.0026 μg/L. As this application is dealing with extension of indication, a total PECsw can be 
calculated and the ERA based on the total PECsw of 0.058 μg/L, representing contributions from newly 
sought and from approved indications, as originally submitted by the MAH, is appropriate for this 
extension of indication application.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspect 
Considering the above data, tofacitinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The previously submitted clinical pharmacology and in vitro studies provided within the initial tofacitinib 
RA MAA included 25 Phase 1 studies comprising of 20 clinical pharmacology and 5 biopharmaceutic 
studies and 19 in vitro studies using biomaterials relevant to PK processes.  
In addition, population PK reports in RA (S0000 PMAR-00178), PsA (S0014 PMAR-EQDD-A392j-sNDA-
601) and PsO (S0002 PMAR-EQDD-A392g-DP3-112) were previously submitted.

Dose modifications based on PK data (ie, renal and hepatic impairment and DDIs) 
No new Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies or in vitro studies are included in this AS application. 
Two studies are submitted within this application: Phase 2 dose-ranging Study A3921119 and Phase 3 
Study A3921120. An overview of studies is presented in Table 4. Three tofacitinib doses of 2 mg, 5 mg 
and 10 mg BID were evaluated in both AS studies combined. Data from Studies A3921119 and A3921120 
were pooled to characterise the PK of tofacitinib in adult patients with active AS and to identify intrinsic 
and extrinsic patient specific factors that may impact the PK of tofacitinib (pop PK: PMAR-EQDD-A392k-
sNDA-1064). Population PK analysis was conducted using the nonlinear mixed effects modelling approach. 
Exposure metrics derived from the population PK model were used for the further development of the E-R 
relationships.

Xeljanz immediate release (IR) formulation is currently approved in the EU as a BID treatment for RA, PsA 
and UC. 
No new biopharmaceutic studies are included in this AS MAA IR dossier. 
The biopharmaceutic data presented in that original submission for RA also support the use of tofacitinib in 
AS. Study A3921005 examined the BA of a tablet formulation used in the RA Phase 2A study relative to 
OPC, which was used in the single and multiple ascending dose studies (A3921002 and A3921003). Study 
A3921005 also estimated the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation. A pivotal BE 
study (A3921075) evaluated the BE between tofacitinib tablets used in Phase 2B and Phase 3 studies and 
commercial tablets. Study A3921076 estimated the effect of food on the commercial tablet. The absolute 
BA of tofacitinib was investigated in Study A3921077 using the commercial tablet versus an IV formulation. 
Study A3921135 was conducted to establish BE between tofacitinib 1 × 5 mg tablets and 5 × 1 mg tablets 
used in RA Phase 2B studies to support the registration in Japan for the treatment of RA. 
Table 5 lists the formulations and dose strengths that were used in the AS studies. The commercial 5 mg 
tablet formulation was used in both AS trials, A3921119 and A3921120, while the 1 mg tablet formulation 
was used only in A3921119, a Phase 2 dose ranging study in AS patients.

The specific and sensitive bioanalytical methods using solid-phase extraction followed by the HPLC-MS/MS 
detection that were developed and validated for the measurement of tofacitinib concentrations in human 
plasma from AS patients are briefly described below. 
A  HPLC-MS/MS  method  (Pfizer  Validation  A3929023)  was  developed  and  validated  at  WuXi  AppTec 
(Shanghai, China), with a quantitative range of 0.100 to 350 ng/mL with quadratic regression. The method 
was transferred to PPD (Richmond, VA and Middleton, WI) and validated (Pfizer Validation A3929032) with 
a truncated quantitative range from 0.100 to 100 ng/mL with linear regression.  
Details of the specific methods, validation assessments and results can be found in the validation reports 
listed  in  the  Tables  6  as  well  as  a  summary  of  the  bioanalytical  assay  performance  during  the  sample 
analyses for clinical studies for the AS development program (Table 7).

Tofacitinib plasma concentrations were measured through HPLC-MS/MS method developed and validated 
at Wuxi AppTec (Shangai, China – A3929023) and then transferred at PPD (Richmond and Middleton).  
Samples  from  Study  A3921119  were  analysed  by  Wuxi,  whereas  samples  from  Study  A3921120  were 
analysed by PPD in Middleton. Furthermore, in study A3921119 sodium heparin plasma was used and in 
study A3921120 lithium heparin plasma. The table above reports the cross validation A3929023 addendum 
6, however, as confirmed by the MAH and accepted by the CHMP this cross validation is not applicable to 
the current analysis since it is performed between Wuxi and PPD in Richmond 
A method transfer was performed from PPD in Richmond to PPD in Middleton and an assay performance 
with respect to precision, accuracy, and specificity was conducted.   
The Pfizer method A3929032 was transferred from PPD Richmond to PPD Middleton, and a method transfer 
was submitted as A3929032 addendum 1.

No cross-validation was performed between PPD Middleton and Wuxi, however the MAH is the opinion 
that since the method used at Richmond and that used at Middleton remained exactly the same, the cross 
validation between Wuxi and PPD Richmond supports the comparability of data analysis also between 
Wuxi and PPD Middleton. This is not exactly in line with EMA guideline on Bioanalytical methods reports 
that states “Where data are obtained from different methods within and across studies or when data are 
obtained within a study from different laboratories, applying the same method, comparison of those data 
is needed, and a cross validation of the applied analytical methods should be carried out”. However, since 
the method transfer to PPD Middleton showed that selectivity, carryover, linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, 
precision, recovery, dilution, and stability were met, the method is considered valid for the extraction and 
analysis of human lithium heparin plasma. This issue was not therefore further pursued by the CHMP.  
The MAH didn’t resubmit the Bioanalytical report for the determination of tofacitinib samples collected in 
Study A3921119, this was acceptable as the study was already submitted and assessed by the CHMP in 
the context of extension of indication in psoriatic arthritis. In this Study, a total of 1011 samples were 
analysed by Wuxi (method A3929023); the maximum storage time at -20±5°C in sodium heparin was 
309 days (validated LTS at 1274 day at -20±5°C). The ISR was performed on 104 samples and fulfilled 
the acceptance criteria. 
The MAH has provided the bioanalytical report for study A3921120 and declared that all samples were 
analysed during the stability period. The number of samples received is 1848, however the samples 
analysed were 922. In the Appendix 4 of the bioanalytical report, the note 8 denotes samples not assayed 
at Sponsor’s request and was reported for several samples, all in the treatment B. The MAH was 
requested to clarify what treatment the letter B refers to and the reason why the Sponsor requested to 
not analyse these samples. 
The MAH clarified that, Appendix 4 of the Bioanalytical Report for Study A3921120, titled, “Concentration 
Data (ng/mL) for CP-690550 in Human Plasma Samples from Protocol A3921120” has a list of Comment 
Codes and Descriptions, of which samples with Code 8 or Note 8, identifies samples that were 
commented as, “Sample not assayed at Sponsor’s request”. The “Sponsor Instructions and Bioanalytical 
Notes” section of the bioanalytical plan (Module 5.3.5.1 CSR A3921120 Analytical Reports Section 8.7 
Appendix 2) in the bioanalytical report provides the following instructional text: “Do not assay placebo 
samples”. As per this bioanalytical plan, samples that were designated as treatment B in Study A3921120 
were not assayed as they were placebo samples. The clarification provided by the MAH is endorsed by the 
CHMP.

It is of note that a high variability is observed in PK parameters for all dosages and time points.  
Population PK in AS patients: PMAR-EQDD-A392k-sNDA-1064 
The population PK of tofacitinib has been previously characterized in RA patients by pooling data from 5 
Phase 2 studies (A3921019, A3921025, A3921035, A3921039 and A3921040), and a long-term extension 
study  A3921024,  in  PsO  patients  from  one  Phase  2  study(A3921047),  4  Phase  3  studies  (A3921078, 
A3921079, A3921080, A3921111), in patients with active PsA from 2 Phase 3 studies, and in patients with 
UC from one Phase 2 study (A3921063) and 3 Phase 3 studies (A3921094, A3921095, A3920196).

A one compartment model parameterized in terms of apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of 
distribution  (V/F),  consistent  with  monophasic  elimination,  with  either  zero-order  absorption  or  first 
absorption were previously utilized to describe the PK of tofacitinib in these patient populations. 
The current PopPK includes data from studies A3921119 and A3921120 (Table 10). Study A3921229 was 
a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of the efficacy and safety of 
tofacitinib in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis with a duration of 12 weeks. Study A3921120 was 
Phase  3,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  study  of  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  tofacitinib  in 
subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis; the duration was 16 weeks in double blind and 32 in open-label. 
Table 10. PK Sampling Schedule in the Studies 
The objectives of this analysis were: 
• To characterize the PK of tofacitinib in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
• To identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors (covariates) that impact the PK of tofacitinib in these patients. 
•  To  obtain  individual  steady  state  exposures  and  PK  parameters  for  subsequent  exposure-response 
analyses. 
The population PK analysis was conducted using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. The 
software packages NONMEM version 7.4.3 (ICON plc., Gaithersburg, MD) and Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN) 
version 4.9.0 as supporting software for the execution of NONMEM was used. R version 3.6.1 (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for data handling, exploratory data 
analysis and creation of graphs for presentations and reports. The estimation method was the first-order 
conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI). 
The study population consisted of 222 males and 57 females with ages ranging from 20 to 75 years and 
weights ranging from 42.3 to 143 kg. The median values of age and body weights at baseline were 40 
years and 78 kg. The median value of the Cockroft-Gault calculated creatinine clearance at baseline 
(BCCL) was 126 mL/min ranging from 48.1 mL/min to 244 mL/min. The distributions of age and BCCL 
were similar across studies. Baseline CRP (BCRP) had a median value of 0.851 mg/dL and ranged from 
0.019 to 8.71 mg/dL. Distribution of race was: 79.9% White, and 19.7% Asian. Hispanic/Latino patients 
were only 1.4% in the dataset population.

Drug concentrations that were below the analytical lower limit of quantification, or any values that were 
otherwise missing, were labelled as such, and were excluded from the analyses. There were total of 20 
(1.0%) data records below limit of quantification (BLQ) that were excluded. There were no missing 
observations in the final dataset, therefore no data imputations were performed. None of the covariates 
were missing data greater than 10%. 
The analyses were conducted in the following steps: 1) Base Structural Model Development, 2) Random 
Effects Model Development, 3) Full Model Development, 4) Assessment of Model Adequacy and 5) Model 
Predictive Performance (Validation). 
Base model. Given prior knowledge, a PK model based on the RA and PsA populations were used as a 
starting point for model development.  
A one compartment disposition model parameterized in terms of apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent 
volume of distribution (V/F), and a first-order absorption rate constant (ka), was chosen as starting point. 
Adding IIV to ka showed a decrease in OFV of 280. When an absorption lag time (tlag) was incorporated, 
the parameter value for ka was estimated to be very large (> 9 hr-1; absorption t1/2<5 minutes). 
According to the MAH, this may be due to the limited information describing the absorption in this 
sparsely sampled data set. Additionally, the distribution of the random effect on ka was still skewed in 
these models.  
After evaluation of the different structural models, the one compartment model with first order 
absorption, IIV on CL/F and V/F with OMEGA block and no IIV on ka, different proportional residual error 
for observations with TAD<9 or ≥9 hours on residual error were chosen as the base model (Run 1, table 
12).

Table 12. List of Key Runs for Based Model 
The typical estimates of CL/F and V/F from the base model were 26.7 L/h and 124 L, respectively (Table 
13), with relative standard errors of <3%. The ka was estimated to be 3.06 h−1 with an RSE of 10.1%. 
IIV estimates for CL/F and V/F were 30.5% and 39.2%, respectively. The correlation coefficient between 
CL/F and V/F was 0.735. Residual variability for observations with TAD <9 hours and TAD ≥9 hours were 
60.3% and 69.5%, respectively (Table 13).  Shrinkage estimates from the base model were 21.5% for IIV 
of CL/F, 24.8% for IIV of V/F and 8.94% for IIV of residual error, respectively.

Random  Effects  Model  Development.  Inter-individual  variance  (IIV)  was  included  on  the  PK  parameters 
using multiplicative exponential random effects. Inter-occasion variance (IOV) terms were investigated for 
F or CL/F. The individual parameter value (θi) is a function of the typical individual parameter value (θ) and 
an individual deviation represented by ηi and an occasion-specific deviation represented by ki j, expressed 
as: θi = θ •exp(ηi+ki j).  
Residual  variability  was  modeled  as  additive  on  log-transformed  scale  or  approximate  additive  + 
proportional on log-transformed scale error model: ln(Yijk) = ln(Fi jk)+εi jk where Yijk denotes the observed 
concentration for the ith individual at occasion jth, and time kth, Fijk denotes the corresponding predicted

ETA-shrinkage was monitored throughout model development. 
Inclusion of Covariates and Full Model Development. The parameter-covariate combinations for included in 
the final full model are listed in Table 14. 
Table 14. Covariates to be evaluated during PK modeling 
Continuous covariates (eg. body weight) were included in the model as follows: 
where θi is the value of the parameter for the ith individual, θTV is the typical value of the parameter in 
the population, covi is the value of the covariate for the individual, covmedian is the median value of the 
covariate in the study population and θx is the effect of the covariate on the parameter. 
Categorical covariates were introduced in the model as follows: 
where θx,cov=Xy is the effect of the covariate belonging to category y, where y goes from 0 (reference 
category) to m (the number of categories-1). 
Continuous  covariates  were  incorporated  as  power  functions,  normalized  to  the  reference  (approximate 
median)  values.  Each  category  of  categorical  covariates  (gender,  and  race)  entered  the  model  as  one 
coefficient. The equations of the full model are listed below included for the final full model.

BWT and ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) were also predefined as potential predictors of CL/F. However, 
for avoiding collinearity in predictors, BWT effect on CL/F was not employed in the final full model as BWT 
was correlated with BCCL (correlation coefficient>0.5).  
As BCCL was calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation based on subjects’ serum creatinine level as well 
as age, sex and body weight at baseline, the impact of including both BWT and BCCL on CL/F in the full 
model was investigated by testing the models including BCCL or BWT on CL/F. Compared to Run 65 (full 
model with BCCL only), the model with both BWT and BCCL (Run 2) or with BWT only (Run 90) on CL/F led 
to change slightly in OFV of -0.066 and +6.301, respectively, indicating that the impact of BWT on CL/F 
was negligible. 
Also, as most patients in the dataset were non-Hispanic/Latino (97.8%), ethnicity was not included. 
The parameter estimates for the final full model and bootstrap results are presented in the Tables 15, 16. 
Table 15. Parameter Estimates for the Final Full Model (Run 65) 
The point estimates (95% bootstrap CI) of CL/F, V/F, and ka are 27.1 (25.8, 28.5) L/hr, 126 (120, 134) L 
and 3.07 (2.56, 3.74) hr-1, respectively, for the typical reference individual (white, male, 78 kg, 40 year 
old, BCCL 126 mL/min, and BCRP 0.851 mg/dL). 
The 95% CIs for BCRP and SEX(Female) effects on CL/F contained the null value. The effects of Age, BCCL, 
and RACE(Asian) on CL/F were significant (CIs excluded null). Baseline body weight and age also impacted 
V/F (CIs excluding null).

Results 
Some inferences could be made using the parameters from the full model: 
•  An  elderly  patient  (64  years  of  age,  95th  percentile  of  age)  was  estimated to  have 10.9% lower  CL/F 
compared to the CL/F a 40-year-old patient. 
• Female patients were estimated to have 2.4% higher CL/F compared to males. 
• Asian patients were estimated to have 10.3% lower CL/F compared to non-Asian patients.

• A patient with a BCCL of 50 mL/min, CL/F was estimated have a 19.4% lower CL/F relative to a patient 
with BCCL 126 mL/min (median value in the analysis dataset). 
• A patient with BCRP of 8 mg/dL was predicted to have a 4.1% lower CL/F compared to a patient with 
BCRP of 0.851 mg/dL. 
• V/F estimates of an elderly patient (64 years of age, 95th percentile of age) was estimated to be 10.2% 
lower compared to the V/F of a 40-year-old patient. 
•  V/F  estimates  for  patients  weighing  54  or  107  kg  (5th  and  95th  percentile  of  body  weight)  were 
approximately 19% lower or 20% higher compared to patients with body weight 78 kg, respectively. 
Secondary exposure metrics for exposure-response analyses were calculated using the individual parameter 
estimates obtained from the full model (Table 17). 
Table 17. Summary of Secondary Pharmacokinetic Parameter Predictions Based on the Final Full Model 
(Run 65) 
The  impact  of  covariate  effects  on  tofacitinib  secondary  parameters  (AUC  and  Cmax)  is  evaluated  and 
demonstrated in Figure 3. With the exception of BCCL, point estimates of AUC and Cmax change relative 
to typical subject ranged between 98% and 112%, and between 89% and 115%, respectively. For a patient 
with a BCCL of 50 mL/min (lowest value in the analysis dataset was 48 mL/min), AUC was estimated to be 
24% higher relative to a reference patient with baseline creatinine clearance of 126 mL/min. As subjects 
with baseline creatinine clearance values (estimated by Cockcroft-Gault equation) below 50 mL/min was 
very limited in the analysis dataset, the need for dose adjustment in renal impairment is primarily assessed 
using Phase 1 data from Studies A3921004 and A3921006. The point estimates of the AUC and Cmax ratios 
and the associated 90% CI indicated no major differences in tofacitinib exposure over the range of ages 
and body weights studied as well as race, and gender.

The population PK of tofacitinib in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis was adequately described by 
a one-compartment model with first order absorption. 
Between-subject variability (%CV) in tofacitinib CL/F was estimated to be 28%. 
Tofacitinib does not require dose modification or restrictions for age, body weight, gender, or race in the 
adult ankylosing spondylitis population based on the <20% differences in AUC and Cmax ratios across these 
patient factors relative to a reference AS patient. 
The relationship between tofacitinib CL/F and creatinine clearance is consistent with the known contribution 
of renal excretion to the total clearance of tofacitinib. 
Population PK analysis results in AS indicated that tofacitinib exposure, as measured by the steady state 
AUC24  after  5  mg  BID  is  similar  (differences  between  geometric  means  within  25%)  among  AS  (382 
ng•h/mL), PsA (419 ng•h/mL), RA (507 ng•h/mL) and PsO (404 ng•h/mL) patients.  
Population PK analysis results indicated comparable inter-subject variability (%CV) in AUC across AS, RA, 
PsA and PsO patients (all ranged between 27% and 32%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 33/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the demonstrated similarity in the tofacitinib PK profile between AS and RA (and PsA) patients, it 
is  proposed  that  dosing  modifications  derived  for  RA  patients,  primarily  based  on  Phase  1  clinical 
pharmacology studies, are also applicable for patients with AS.  
Consistent  with  dose  adjustment  recommendations  in  the  current  SmPC  for  RA  and  PsA  patients,  the 
recommended total daily dose of tofacitinib will be reduced by half, from 5 mg BID to 5 mg QD (of the IR 
formulation) for AS patients with severe renal impairment, moderate hepatic impairment, patients receiving 
potent  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  (for  example,  itraconazole),  patients  receiving  1  or  more  concomitant 
medications  that  result  in  both  moderate  inhibition  of  CYP3A4  and  potent  inhibition  of  CYP2C19  (for 
example,  fluconazole),  moreover  tofacitinib  is  not  recommended  in  AS  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment and the coadministration of tofacitinib and potent inducers of CYP3A4, such as rifampin, to AS 
patients may result in loss of or reduced clinical response.  
The  starting  point  for  the  popPk  in  AS  patients  was  based  on  models  previously  used  in  RA  and  PsA 
population. A one compartmental model with first order absorption and IIV on CL/F and V/F with OMEGA 
block was chosen. IIV on Ka reduced the OFV, moreover the inclusion of tlag determines an increase of Ka 
estimation with a very quickly absorption phase. The MAH justify this result, and then the exclusion of IIV 
on  Ka,  with  the  sparse  sampling  data  limiting  the  information  on  the  absorption  phase.  Although  this 
justification is sharable, the exclusion of IIV on ka did not permit to evaluate the variability in the absorption 
phase that, in general is of interest for the investigation of the PK profile, thus even for a PopPK model. 
The residual error for observations with TAD <9 hours and TAD ≥9 hours was evaluated in the model. 
The population (PK) analysis in AS patients was performed using pooled sparse samples collected in Studies 
A3921119  and  A3921120,  based  on  the  PK  sampling  schema  (i.e.,  pre-dose,  0.5,  2,  and  3  hours  after 
dose), as designated in the respective study protocols (S0113 Module 5.3.3.5 PMAR-EQDD-A392k-sNDA-
1064). 
In this population PK analysis in AS patients, residual random effects were described with 2 proportional 
error models for non-trough samples defined as time after dose (TAD) <9 hours, and trough samples (TAD 
≥9 hours), respectively. Trough samples can be noisier than nontrough samples and tend to have a higher 
variability. 
Figure 4 shows the distribution of observed tofacitinib plasma concentrations vs. time after dose by study. 
As mentioned above, the PK samples were collected based on a sparse sampling schema. It can be observed 
from Figure 4 that the trough samples (primarily from pre-dose sampling) were mostly collected beyond 9 
hours post-dose, with very few to almost no samples between 5- and 9-hours TAD. Given this collection 
profile, 9 hours was used as the TAD cut-off value to differentially estimate residual errors for trough and 
non-trough plasma concentrations. Base on the provided justification, the choice of 9 hours as the TAD cut-
off value is considered reasonable.

In the initial MAA, the Applicant submitted a nonlinear mixed effects analysis of Cmax and AUC (derived 
using noncompartmental methods) from 16 Phase 1 studies concluding that Cmax is approximately dose 
proportional at least up to 10 times the proposed dose of 5 mg.  
Study A3921002, a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation study was also 
submitted  in  the  initial  MAA  in  which  95  subjects  were  randomized  in  different  dose  group  to  receive  a 
single doses of 0.1 to 100 mg tofacitinib, (0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 100 mg) 
administered  as  oral  power  for  constitution  (OPC).  Systemic  exposures  (Cmax  and  AUC∞)  of  tofacitinib 
increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner,  indicating  linear  pharmacokinetics  across  the  dose  interval 
evaluated (0,1 and 100 mg dose, Table 18). There are only small changes from linearity mostly for Cmax 
values from 1 mg dose.

The MAH has provided the predicted PK parameters for 2 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg derived from PopPK in AS 
patients. Although, as previously highlighted, the results of the PopPK should be interpreted with caution, 
it seems that a dose proportionality exists between 2 mg and 5 mg.  
The covariates included in the model are race, sex, ethnicity, age, BW, BCCL and BCRP on CL/F and BW 
and age on V/F. No stepwise testing was performed, whereas the full covariate approach was used. The 
correlation  between  covariates  was  assessed.  BW  was  not  included  in  the  final  model  due  to  the  high 
correlation with BCLL and also ethnicity was not included due to high prevalence of non-Hispanic/Latino. 
The  inclusion  of  covariates  in  the  model  improved  the  parameter  estimation  with  decrease  in  IIV.  The 
bootstrap  confidence  intervals  (95%  CI)  for  the  parameters  were  generated  from  1000  non-parametric 
bootstrap. The median value of CL/F and V/F calculated by the bootstrap was similar to that estimated in 
the  full  model.  Overall,  the  GoF  showed  that  the  model  adequately  fits  the  observed  concentrations, 
however  it  is  noted  that  a  greater number  of  observations  are  above  the  line  of  identity.  Moreover,  the 
CWRES vs time showed that, in particular at earlier time points, a number of observations are outside the 
-/+ 2 CWRES. This is in line with the fact that the model is not able to catch the variability in the absorption 
phase. Some outliers are also showed in the graphs of CWRES vs predicted concentrations. 
The VPC showed that the concentrations in the early phase of absorption were underpredicted by the model, 
in  particular  the  lower  concentrations  (5th  percentile),  whereas  the  concentrations  in  the  95th  percentile 
were overpredicted. Y axis of VPC plot reports “concentration. 
The MAH was requested to better specify which PK parameter was reported and to provide the VPC plotting 
the  Cmin,  Cmax  and  Cavg  as  dependent  variable.  The  response  provided  by  the  MAH  is  considered 
sufficient. However, a certain degree of variability has been observed. Although a sparse sampling has been 
applied  to  PK  parameters,  the  number  of  observed  values  appear  to  be  sufficient  to  conclude  that  high 
variability  is  observed  after  the  administration  of  tofacitinib  and  that  the  model  predictions  (5  and  95 
percentile) are even larger that observed concentrations. This reduce the reliability and the precision of the 
model. Therefore, all the analysis based on predicted plasma concentrations derived from the present model 
should be interpreted with caution.

The PopPK model was also used to calculate the secondary exposure parameters Cmax, Cavg, Cmin, AUC 
over  the  dosing  interval  and  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  covariates  on  AUC  and  Cmax.  Except  for  BCLL, 
impacted by the renal elimination of tofacitinib, all covariates have a marginal effect on PK parameters.  
The  tofacitinib  exposure  showed  in  the  PopPK  for  AS  is  superimposable  to  that  observed  in  the  other 
populations of patients (PsA, RA, PsO) in terms of AUC24 after 5 mg BID dose. The AUC24 considered were 
the following: AS (382 ng•h/mL), PsA (419 ng•h/mL), RA (507 ng•h/mL) and PsO (404 ng•h/mL).  
In order to further compare the PK profile of tofacitinib throughout the different diseases, a summary of 
model-predicted exposure parameters based on the population PK analyses across indications is provided 
in the Table 19. The results shows that tofacitinib exposure for AS is superimposable to that observed in 
the other populations of patients (PsA, RA, PsO) in terms of AUC24, as well as in terms of Cavg, Cmax and 
Cmin after 5 mg BID dose. However, the submission of observed exposure parameters would have been 
more correct in order to compare them and their variability among different indications. However, the AS 
effect on PK profile is not expected to be clinically relevant if any.

Table 20. Tofacitinib Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies in AS Population Included in the Analyses 
The primary objectives are: 
• To characterize the relationship between tofacitinib exposure and ASAS response levels of 20% and 
40%  (ASAS20  and  ASAS40,  respectively)  over  time,  in  subjects  with  active  AS  using  a  longitudinal 
exposure response model. 
• To compare predicted PK measures, including of steady state Cavg, Cmin and Cmax, in an E-R analysis 
of ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses in subjects with active AS.  
The secondary objectives are: 
• Investigate the effects of specified covariates (prior biologic therapy) on the E-R relationship for ASAS20 
and ASAS40 
A dose-response analysis (with a Bayesian Emax model) was conducted, using ASAS20 responder rates at 
Week 12 from the Phase 2 dose-ranging study, Study A3921119. This study had evaluated placebo and 3 
tofacitinib  doses  (2  mg,  5  mg  or  10  mg  BID)  for  12  weeks  in  bDMARD  naïve  patients  with  active  AS. 
Placebo-corrected  ASAS20  responder  rates,  along  with  95%,  60%  and  50%  credible  intervals  were 
estimated using this Bayesian model. 
This primary endpoint analysis using an Emax model, estimated that ASAS20 response rates were higher 
than placebo for all tofacitinib dose groups. However, although the tofacitinib 2 mg BID and tofacitinib 5 
mg BID treatment groups showed an estimated difference from placebo of 15.8% and 22.9%, respectively, 
they both did not meet the pre-specified statistical decision rules for the primary endpoint of the ASAS20 
response rate at Week 12. Only the tofacitinib 10 mg BID treatment group met pre-specified rules for the 
primary endpoint of the ASAS20 response rate at Week 12 with an estimated response rate of 67.4%, an 
estimated difference from placebo of 27.3%, a 20.3% difference from placebo for the lower bound of the 
2-sided 60% credible interval (ie, 1-sided 80% lower bound), and a 33.0% difference for the upper bound 
of the 2-sided 50% credible interval (ie, 1-sided 75% upper bound). 
The  population  E-R  model  was  carried  out  using  the  nonlinear  mixed  effects  modeling  approach  as 
implemented  in  the  software  package  NONMEMR  version  7.4.1  (ICON  Development  Solutions,  Hanover, 
MD).  Perl-speaks-NONMEM  (PsN),  version  4.8.0  was  used  as  supporting  software  for  the  execution  of 
NONMEM.

The analysis was conducted based on the following strategy: Base Structural Model Development; Inclusion 
of  Covariates;  Assessment  of  Model  Adequacy  (Goodness  of  Fit);  Assessment  of  Final  Model  Predictive 
Performance. 
Base Model Description. The ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses were modeled simultaneously as an ordered 
categorical variable Y(t) taking on possible responses with Y = 2 if achieving ASAS40, Y = 1 if achieving 
ASAS20  but  not  ASAS40  and  Y  =  0,  if  not  achieving  ASAS20,  at  time  t.  Hence  the  probability  of 
achieving Y = k, with k = 1 or 2 to a predictor M(X;b) can be modeled using logistic regressions, such as: 
where α1 > α2 represents the intercepts of each ASAS cutpoint, X a matrix of covariates, β a  vector of 
regression coefficients, and h-1 the inverse link function that restricts the probability between 0 and 1. In a 
logistic  regression,  this  parameterization  where  M(X;β)  is  the  same  for  all  k  corresponding  to  the 
proportional odds assumption. 
Note that prob[Y(t) ≥ 0] = 1, so that in the model it is only necessary to estimate the cumulative probability 
for  the  score  1  and  2.  The  probability  for  each  individual  score  can  thereafter  be  calculated  from  the 
estimated cumulative probability using following equations. 
For a logistic regression, the link function and its inverse function can be defined such as: 
For the E-R modeling, a general nonlinear mixed-effects model was constructed based on the combined 
ASAS20 and ASAS40 response: 
Where η is the inter-individual variance (IIV) which is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 
and variance 1, fdrug(t) the drug effect function, and fplacebo(t) the placebo effect function. For the 
longitudinal analysis, the following exponential equation was used to investigate the time course and 
onset of drug effect and placebo effect:

where Deffect and Peffect are the drug effect and placebo effect, respectively; DThalf and PThalf are the 
half-life of drug effect and placebo effect respectively; t stands for time with unit of week. 
Drug effect was evaluated using individual Cavg values as the exposure metric, and investigated with linear, 
Emax, or exponential models (Equation 9). 
where  Dslp  is  the  slope  for  the  exposure-response  relationship  with  Cavg.  Emax  is  the  maximum  drug 
effect. EC50 is the concentration to reach 50% of Emax. K is shape parameter. 
Inclusion  of  Covariates.  The  primary  covariate  of  interest  in  this  analysis  was  previous  bDMARD  use. 
Approximately 20% of subjects in Study A3921120 were stratified to be biologic-experienced (either TNF-
inadequate  responders  or  bDMARD-experienced).  A  covariate  effect  for  previous  bDMARD  use  was 
evaluated. This effect was assessed on the most appropriate model parameter (i.e., Peffect of the placebo 
effect, or Deffect of the drug effect) or function.

Table 24. List of Key Model Runs 
After careful evaluation of the various structural models, including a model that used tofacitinb BID dose, 
a model with exponential time-dependent onsets of placebo and drug effect, and the drug effect component 
described by an  Emax model form (Run 1) was selected to describe the relationship between tofacitinib 
exposure and efficacy in AS. 
Parameter estimates of the base model (Run 1) are presented in Table 25.

IIV was applied to the logit value of cumulative probability (h-1 prob[Y(t) ≥ k]). The standard errors for the 
parameter  estimates  were  small  (30%),  except  for  estimate  of  EC50  (RSE  =  604%).  h-shrinkage  was 
21.5%. There was absence of extreme pairwise correlations (r>0.95) of the parameters or high condition 
number  of  the  correlation  matrix  of  the  parameter  estimates  (k>1000).  1000  non-parametric  bootstrap 
were performed to generate the 90%CI of parameter estimates using the base model. Of these, 29 runs 
with  immunization  terminated  and  326  runs  with  estimates  near  a  boundary  (total  355)  were  excluded 
when calculating the bootstrap results.

As  shown  in  the  ETA  (η)  histograms  and  quantile-quantile  plots,  there  is  lack  of  normality  in  the  η 
distribution. The sharp peak on the lower end of the distribution represents the inflated η values from non-
responders (data not shown). The η values estimated for these patients were consistently low. However, 
this lack of normality in distribution did not impact the goodness of fit evaluated using simulation-based 
diagnostic plots, which are the primary diagnostic plots. 
Final Model Results 
Prior bDMARD experience (PMED) and study effect (PROT) were tested on baseline (h-1 prob[Y(t) ≥ 1]), 
placebo effect (Peffect ), or drug effect (Deffect ) in order to evaluate their effect on ASAS20/40 response 
rates. PMED has 2 levels including 0 and 1, which represents bDMARD naive (0) or experienced (1). PMED 
was  identified  as  significant  covariate  on  Peffect  (Run  4).  Patients  with  prior  bDMARD  treatment 
experience showed a lower response to placebo in Study A3921120. However, study effect as a covariate 
did not provide a better fitting (Run 5 and 6), therefore, it was not included in the final model. Run 4 was 
considered the final model. 
The parameter estimates for the final model are presented in Table 26.

The standard errors for the parameter estimates were small (30%), except for the EC50 estimate with 
RSE of 135%. h-shrinkage was 21.6%. There was absence of extreme pairwise correlations (r>0.95) of 
the parameters or high condition number of the correlation matrix of the parameter estimates (k>1000). 
Diagnostic plots for goodness of fit are presented in the Figures 8 and 9.

As  shown  in  the  parameter  estimates  from  both  the  base  and  final  models,  there  is  a  high  degree  of 
uncertainty on the EC50 estimate (high RSE values), most likely due to the lack of data at the lower end of 
the  concentration  range  (Figure  10).  1000  non-parametric  bootstrap  were  performed  to  generate  the 
90%CI of parameter estimates using the final model. Of these, 27 runs for which miminization terminated, 
and 245 runs with estimates near a boundary (total 272 runs) were excluded when calculating the bootstrap 
results. This may be due to the limited information in the data to precisely characterize the EC50. Placebo 
treatment reached half of the maximum effect in 2.55 weeks (90%CI [1.63, 4.06]). The half-life of drug 
onset was estimated to be 1.18 weeks for ASAS20/40 (90%CI [0.74, 2.14]).

Model Predicted ASAS20 and ASAS40 Responses based on Simulation 
The model predicted ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates based on simulation are listed in Table 27. 
Model-predicted ASAS20 response rates after tofacitinib 2 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg BID were 64%, 67% and 
68%, respectively and ASAS40 response rates were 40%, 44%, and 45% respectively, in bDMARD-naive 
AS patients at Week 16. 
Placebo-corrected estimates of ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates at Week 16 were 32% and 28% after 
5 mg BID in AS patients who were bDMARD-naive. In the bDMARD-experienced group, placebo-corrected 
ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates at Week 16, after 5 mg BID were estimated to be 27% and 16%, 
respectively. 
Table 27. Model- Predicted ASAS20 and ASAS40 Response Rates at Week 16 in bDMARD-Naïve Patients 
Simulations to illustrate the exposure-response relationship were also performed and plotted with 
observed response rates at Week 12 (Figure 15, Figure 16). Model predictions of placebo-corrected 
estimates after 2 mg BID (ASAS20 of 29% and ASAS40 of 24%) in bDMARD-naive AS patients at Week 
16 were slightly lower compared to 5 mg BID.

Comparison Between Tofacitinib Exposure Metrics 
Table 28 summarizes the model evaluation for the different E-R models fitted using ASAS20 and ASAS40 
response rates in AS patients. Models with Cavg, Cmin or Cmax as the predictor (univariate analysis) did 
not show differences in model diagnostics (OFV or AIC differences less than 3.84 units) that would support 
the conclusion of any one exposure parameter being more relevant to clinical efficacy compared to another. 
This  was  not  unexpected  since  these  PK  parameters  are  highly  correlated,  particularly  Cavg  and  Cmin 
(correlation coefficient=0.85) (Figure 17); the exposure measures contain very similar information.

Figure 17. Frequency Distribution and Correlation Between Tofacitinib Exposure Metrics 
Ten (10) mg ASAS20 and ASAS40 VPC final model plots showed a slight overprediction; for 2 mg and 5 
mg ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 they seem to look better. 
Placebo-corrected estimates of ASAS20 response rates in bDMARD-naive patients after the 5 mg BID 
dose, were 18% by Week 2, and reached 28% by Week 4. Placebo-corrected estimates of ASAS20 and 
ASAS40 response rates at Week 16 were 32% and 28% after 5 mg BID in AS patients who were 
bDMARD-naive. In the bDMARD-experienced group, placebo-corrected ASAS20 and ASAS40 response 
rates at Week 16, after 5 mg BID were estimated to be 27% and 16%, respectively. 
For the base model the standard error was high, not only for the estimate of EC50 (RSE = 604%), but 
also for the estimate of Emax (RSE=40.5%); in the final model the standard error for the parameter 
estimates continues to be high for the EC50 estimate with RSE of 135%. The high degree of uncertainty 
on the EC50 estimate was imputed (most likely) to the lack of data at the lower end of the concentration 
range, in any case, for an E-R analysis, this represents a limitation. 
In section Assessment of Model Adequacy (Goodness of Fit) it is reported that “ETA (h) histograms and 
quantile-quantile plots were used assessing the assumption of normality and the appropriateness of the 
selected parameter variability.” Howbeit in both models, the base and the final ones, ETA (η) histograms 
and quantile-quantile plots showed lack of normality in the η distribution. The MAH commented that this 
lack of normality in distribution did not impact the goodness of fit evaluated using simulation-based 
diagnostic plots, which are the primary diagnostic plots, however this represents another limitation.

Models with Cavg, Cmin or Cmax as the predictor (univariate analysis) did not show differences in model 
diagnostics (OFV or AIC differences less than 3.84 units), this would support the conclusion that none 
exposure parameter is more relevant to clinical efficacy compared to another. However, Cavg has been 
chosen as exposure metric to select the model to describe the relationship between tofacitinib exposure 
and efficacy in AS, since it was previously established as the most relevant parameter for tofacitinib 
efficacy in RA. Although there are similarities between RA and AS diseases, the profiles of the two 
pathologies are not perfectly superimposable, therefore the MAH was requested to discuss, in general, the 
potential of disease effect affecting PK profile, and, more in details, that Cavg is the most suitable 
exposure metric, in terms of close association with efficacy, also for AS. which was provided by the MAH 
and the issue considered resolved by the CHMP. 
According to the MAH, the half-life of drug onset was estimated to be 1.18 weeks for ASAS20/40 (90%CI 
[0.74, 2.14]), which is applicable across all dose groups.  
The simulated exposure-response relationship appears to be flat, even flatter compared to observed data. 
In all the exposure-response plots, the 10 mg Cavg median values are always overpredicted; moreover, 
the 10 mg Cavg values are lower than the 5 mg, and, for the ASAS40 values (placebo-corrected), also 
lower than the 2 mg. Considering the above, it can be concluded that the exposure-response curve does 
not properly capture the shape of the relationship showed by the observed Cavg values, even if predicted 
values are within observed ICs values. Overall, the relationship between tofacitinib exposure (Cavg) and 
clinical response seems to be not well captured by the E-R model. In response the MAH clarified that the 
ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates shown in the VPC plots as “observed” are observed proportions for 
each stratified group. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Two studies were submitted within this extension of indication in AS. The study A3921119 was a phase 2 
study in which three doses (2 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg) were administered in bDMARD naïve population. The 
PK dataset included was 50, 49 and 48 patients for 2 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg dose cohort, respectively. The 
PK sampling was at pre-dose, 0.5 hr and 2 hours post dose at Week 4 and pre-dose, 0.5 hr and 3hr post 
dose at Week 8.  The Study A3921120 was a phase 3 study in which only 5 mg dose was administered. 
Patients enrolled were bDMARD naïve (77.2%) and bDMARD experienced (22.8%). The study consists of 
two parts, the first one was the blinded phase and lasted 16 weeks, the second one was the open label 
phase lasted until Week 48. The plasma samples were collected at pre-dose, 0.5 hr and 2 hours post dose 
at Week 4 and pre-dose, 0.5 hr and 3hr post dose at Week 8. The PK dataset included 132 patients. 
Tofacitinib plasma concentrations were measured through HPLC-MS/MS method developed and validated 
at Wuxi AppTec (Shangai, China – A3929023) and then transferred at PPD (Richmond and Middleton). A 
method transfer was performed from PPD in Richmond to PPD in Middleton and an assay performance 
with respect to precision, accuracy, and specificity was conducted.   
Samples from Study A3921119 were analysed by Wuxi, whereas samples from Study A3921120 were 
analysed by PPD in Middleton.  
The cross validation A3929023 addendum 6 is not applicable to the current analysis since it is performed 
between Wuxi (method A3929023), Basi (A3929011) and PPD in Richmond (method A3929032). A 
further cross validation A3929023 Amendment 2 was performed between Wuxi and PPD Richmond. 
No cross-validation was performed between PPD Middleton and Wuxi, however the MAH is of the opinion 
that since the method used at Richmond and Middleton remained exactly the same, the cross validation 
between Wuxi and PPD Richmond supports the comparability of data analysis also between Wuxi and PPD 
Middleton.

This is not exactly in line with EMA guideline, however since the method transfer to PPD Middleton 
showed that selectivity, carryover, linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, recovery, dilution, and 
stability were met, the method is considered valid for the extraction and analysis of human lithium 
heparin plasma. 
The CSR A3921119 mentions a Section 16.2.5.10 containing the bioanalytical report; however, this 
section/appendix was initially missing. The MAH clarified that Study A3921119 was already submitted as 
supportive study in the contest of extension indication in psoriatic arthritis. The bioanalytical report was 
attached to that eCTD sequence and not re-submitted for the current variation. Which is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
A  total  of  1011  samples  were  analysed  by  Wuxi  (method  A3929023);  the  maximum  storage  time  at  -
20±5°C in sodium heparin was 309 days (validated LTS at 1274 day at -20±5°C). The ISR was performed 
on 104 samples and fulfilled the acceptance criteria. 
The MAH provided the bioanalytical report for study A3921120 and declared that all samples were analysed 
during the stability period. The number of samples received is 1848, however the samples analysed were 
922. In the Appendix 4 of the bioanalytical report for study A3921120, the note 8 denotes samples not 
assayed at Sponsor’s request and was reported for several samples, all in the treatment B. The MAH clarified 
that these samples were not assayed as they were placebo samples.  
The PK data were analysed in the PopPK model in which both studies were included. A one compartment 
model with first order absorption, IIV on CL/F and V/F with OMEGA block and no IIV on ka, different 
proportional residual error for observations with TAD<9 or ≥9 hours on residual error was chosen as the 
base model. The effect of covariates was evaluated through the full covariate approach.  
IIV on Ka reduced the OFV, moreover the inclusion of tlag determines an increase of Ka estimation with a 
very quickly absorption phase. The MAH justify this result, and then the exclusion of IIV on Ka, with the 
sparse  sampling  data  limiting  the  information  on  the  absorption  phase.  Although  this  justification  is 
sharable,  the  exclusion  of  IIV  on  ka  did  not  permit  to  evaluate  the  variability  in  the  absorption  that,  in 
general, is a significant part of PopPK model. The residual error for observations with TAD <9 hours and 
TAD ≥9 hours was evaluated in the model, since the trough samples (primarily from pre-dose sampling) 
were mostly collected beyond 9 hours post-dose, with very few to almost no samples between 5- and 9-
hours TAD. Given this collection profile, 9 hours was used as the TAD cut-off value to differentially estimate 
residual errors for trough and non-trough plasma concentrations. 
In  the  initial  MAA,  dose  proportionality  was  concluded  over  a  dose  range  of  5  to  50  mg.  The  Applicant 
included plasma concentrations of patients with treated with 2 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg into the PopPK model. 
However, no information was provided on the dose-proportionately over the dose range of 2 to 5 mg in the 
current variation. In the initial MAA, the MAH submitted a nonlinear mixed effects analysis of Cmax and 
AUC  (derived  using  noncompartmental  methods)  from  16  Phase  1  studies  concluding  that  Cmax  is 
approximately dose proportional at least up to 10 times the proposed dose of 5 mg.  
Study A3921002, a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation study was also 
submitted  in  the  initial  MAA  in  which  95  subjects  were  randomized  in  different  dose  group  to  receive  a 
single doses of 0.1 to 100 mg tofacitinib, (0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 100 mg) 
administered  as  oral  power  for  constitution  (OPC).  Systemic  exposures  (Cmax  and  AUC∞)  of  tofacitinib 
increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner,  indicating  linear  pharmacokinetics  across  the  dose  interval 
evaluated (0,1 and 100 mg dose). There are only small changes from linearity mostly for Cmax values from 
1 mg dose. 
In the contest of this response, the MAH also provided the predicted PK parameters for 2 mg, 5 mg and 10 
mg  derived  from  PopPK  in  AS  patients.  Although,  the  results  of  the  PopPK  should  be  interpreted  with 
caution, it seems that a dose proportionality exists between 2 mg and 5 mg.

The covariates included in the model are race, sex, ethnicity, age, BW, BCCL and BCRP on CL/F and BW 
and age on V/F. The correlation between covariates was assessed. BW was not included in the final model 
due to the high correlation with BCLL and also ethnicity was not included due to high prevalence of non-
Hispanic/Latino. The inclusion of covariates in the model improved the parameter estimation with decrease 
in  IIV%  (RSE%).  The  bootstrap  confidence  intervals  (95%  CI)  for  the  parameters  were  generated  from 
1000 non-parametric bootstrap. The median value of CL/F and V/F calculated by the bootstrap was similar 
to that estimated in the full model.  
Overall, the GoF showed that the model adequately fits the observed concentrations, however it is noted 
that a greater number of observations are above the line of identity. Moreover, the CWRES vs time showed 
that, in particular at earlier time points, a number of observations are outside the -/+ 2 CWRES. This is in 
line with the fact that the model is not able to catch the variability in the absorption phase. Some outliers 
are also showed in the graphs of CWRES vs predicted concentrations. 
The VPC, describing tofacitinib plasma concentration over time, showed that the concentrations in the early 
phase  of  absorption  were  underpredicted  by  the  model,  in  particular  the  lower  concentrations  (5th 
percentile),  whereas  the  concentrations  in  the  95th  percentile  were  overpredicted.  A  certain  degree  of 
variability has been observed. Although a sparse sampling has been applied to PK parameters, the number 
of  observed  values  appear  to  be  sufficient  to  conclude  that  high  variability  is  observed  after  the 
administration  of  tofacitinib  and  that  the  model  prediction  (5  and  95  percentile)  are  even  larger  that 
observed  concentrations.  This  reduces  the  reliability  and  the  precision  of  the  model.  Therefore,  all  the 
analysis based on predicted plasma concentrations derived from the present model should be interpreted 
with caution. 
The PopPK model was also used to calculate the secondary exposure parameters Cmax, Cavg, Cmin, AUC 
over  the  dosing  interval  and  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  covariates  on  AUC  and  Cmax.  Except  for  BCLL, 
impacted by the renal elimination of tofacitinib, all covariates have a marginal effect on PK parameters.  
The  tofacitinib  exposure  showed  in  the  PopPK  for  AS  is  superimposable  to  that  observed  in  the  other 
populations of patients (PsA, RA, PsO) in terms of AUC24 after 5 mg BID dose. The AUC24 considered were 
the following: AS (382 ng•h/mL), PsA (419 ng•h/mL), RA (507 ng•h/mL) and PsO (404 ng•h/mL).  
In  order to  further  compare  the  PK  profile of  tofacitinib  throughout  the different  diseases,  the  MAH  was 
asked  to  provide  a  comparison  of  all  the  main  exposure  parameters,  e.g.  Cavg,  Cmin,  Cmax.  The  MAH 
submitted a summary of model-predicted exposure parameters based on PopPK analyses across indications 
for  Cavg,  Cmax,  Cmin  and  AUC24,  showing  that  tofacitinib  exposure  for  AS  is  superimposable  to  that 
observed in the other populations of patients (PsA, RA, PsO) after 5 mg BID dose. However, also giving the 
comment  above  on  the  model  reliability  in  AS,  the  submission  of  observed  exposure  parameters  would 
have been more correct to compare them and their variability among different indications. However, the 
AS effect on PK profile is not expected to be clinically relevant if any. 
ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses from 2 studies in patients with active AS, A3921119 and A3921120 were 
pooled to support E-R analyses. A longitudinal ordered categorical model was developed to jointly model 
ASAS20  and  ASAS40  responses  to  describe  the  relationship  between  tofacitinib  exposure  and  clinical 
efficacy in patients with active AS after the administration of placebo or tofacitinib doses of 2 mg, 5 mg or 
10 mg BID up to Week 16 (up to Week 12 for 2 mg and 10 mg BID dose groups). For the base model the 
standard  error  was  high,  not  only  estimate  of  EC50  (RSE  =  604%),  but  also  for  the  estimate  of  Emax 
(RSE=40.5%); in the final model the standard error for the parameter estimates continues to be high for 
the EC50 estimate with RSE of 135%. In both models, the base and the final ones, ETA (η) histograms and 
quantile-quantile plots showed lack of normality in the η distribution. The MAH commented that this lack of 
normality  in  distribution  did  not  impact  the  goodness  of  fit  evaluated  using  simulation-based  diagnostic 
plots, which are the primary diagnostic plots, even if the assumption of normality was not met.

Cavg has been used as exposure metric to select the model to describe the relationship between tofacitinib 
exposure and efficacy in AS, since it was previously established as relevant for tofacitinib efficacy in RA. 
Model  evaluation  with  Cavg,  Cmin  or  Cmax  as  the  predictor  (univariate  analysis)  for  the  different  E-R 
models fitted using ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates in AS patients, did not show differences in model 
diagnostics  (OFV  or  AIC  differences  less  than  3.84  units)  that  would  support  the  conclusion  of  any  one 
exposure parameter being more relevant to clinical efficacy compared to another. PK parameters are highly 
correlated, particularly Cavg and Cmin (correlation coefficient=0.85). 
Overall, as in RA, Cavg can be considered as parameter for efficacy in AS.  
The simulated exposure-response relationship appears to be flat, even flatter compared to observed data. 
In all the exposure-response plots, the 10 mg Cavg values are lower than the 5 mg, and, for the ASAS40 
values (placebo-corrected), also lower than the 2 mg. Considering the above, it can be concluded that the 
predicted Cavg values do not properly capture the shape of the relationship showed by the observed Cavg 
values, even if predicted values are within observed ICs values. Overall, the relationship between 
tofacitinib exposure (Cavg) and clinical response seems to be not well captured by the E-R model. All the 
above considered, no reliable conclusion can be drown using the present analysis. In response the MAH 
clarified that the ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates shown in the VPC plots as “observed” are observed 
proportions for each stratified group. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The VPC in the PopPK model showed a high variability in the observed values and the model predictions 
(5th  and  95th  percentile)  are  even  larger  that  the  observed  concentrations,  reducing  the  reliability  and 
precision  of  the  model.  On  this  basis,  the  PK  comparison  between  the  different  indications  should  be 
interpreted with caution. However, the AS effect on PK profile is not expected to be clinically relevant if 
any.  Given  all  the  limitations  of  the  Exposure-Response  analysis,  any  conclusion  should  be  taken  with 
caution. However, the clinical pharmacology properties are still considered sufficiently characterised. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
A3921119 This was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose ranging, 
parallel group efficacy and safety study designed to characterise the dose response of tofacitinib in 
patients with active AS who had experienced an inadequate response to NSAIDs and were naïve to 
previous bDMARDs. This was a proof-of-concept as well as a dose-ranging study that evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of tofacitinib doses of 2 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg IR BID versus placebo (randomised in 
1:1:1:1 ratio) over a 12-week treatment period in adult patients with active AS who had an inadequate 
response to NSAIDs but were bDMARD-naïve. Given the results of Study A3921119, as well as taking into 
consideration the recommended BID posology for tofacitinib in other rheumatologic diseases, 5 mg IR BID 
of tofacitinib was selected to be evaluated in Study A3921120.

2.4.2.  Main study 
A3921120  
This was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study 
designed to compare tofacitinib 5mg dosed twice daily to placebo in subjects with active AS, who had 
experienced an inadequate response to NSAIDs (NSAID-IR) and were additionally either naïve to previous 
bDMARDs, TNFi-IR, or experienced to previous bDMARDs but without inadequate response (bDMARD Use 
[Non-IR]). 
Methods 
The design of the pivotal A3921120 Study is presented in the Figure 18: 
Figure 18. Pivotal Study A3921120 Schematic of Study Design 
The study design includes a screening period of approximately 30 days, a 16-week double-blind treatment 
period, a 32-week open-label treatment period and a 28-day follow-up period (duration of participation for 
eligible subjects was approximately 56 weeks). 
The primary efficacy analysis was at 16 weeks (data cutoff 19DEC2019, data snapshot 29JAN2020) and 
maintenance follow-up to 48 weeks. 
In support of the sought indication the MAH is providing confirmatory evidence from one pivotal study only. 
As per the POINTS TO CONSIDER ON APPLICATION WITH 1. META-ANALYSES; 2. ONE PIVOTAL STUDY, 
CPMP/EWP/2330/99, this study will have to be exceptionally compelling, and in the regulatory evaluation 
special attention will be paid to key aspects including the internal/external validity; Clinical relevance, the 
estimated size of treatment benefit must be large enough to be clinically valuable; the degree of statistical 
significance, statistical evidence considerably stronger-internal consistency. Similar effects demonstrated 
in different pre-specified sub-populations. All-important endpoints showing similar findings. 
The proposed study design is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group comparing 
tofacitinib 5mg dosed twice daily to placebo in subjects with active AS, who had experienced an 
inadequate response to NSAIDs (NSAID-IR) and were additionally either naïve to previous bDMARDs, or 
TNFì-IR or experienced to previous bDMARDs but without inadequate response (bDMARD Use [Non-IR]). 
As per the EMA guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal products for the treatment of Axial 
Spondyloarthritis (EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 1*) the design could be acceptable however 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021

since tofacitinib belongs to a new therapeutic class for the AS indication and the study includes biological 
naïve patients a three-arm trial (including an accepted active comparator) would have been 
recommended, particularly for assessing a relative B/R balance. The Applicant has performed a meta-
analysis of approved treatments and also included the results of the tofacitinib trials (dose-finding and 
pivotal study) as supportive data. This is endorsed. 
The time point for the primary analysis (DB phase) is within the time period indicated by the above 
guideline; the maintenance period is in line with the guideline although a longer Open-Label (OL) period 
would have been recommended for assessing structural changes. Moreover, evaluation of dose 
reduction/stop and/or increased dose interval for subjects obtaining resolution of inflammation could have 
been useful to guide prescribers for long term treatment to avoid unnecessary toxicity.  
The MAH clarified that dose reduction/changing dose interval in AS patients after resolution of 
inflammation following tofacitinib treatment has not been evaluated and that there are no data supporting 
changing dose interval. The same apply for other tofacitinib indications such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The MAH does not intend to seek therapeutic claims in this area and 
therefore any decision on modifying or stopping treatment should be at physician discretion. Moreover, 
the MAH has also specified that at present there is no plan to conduct a long-term extension study for 
tofacitinib in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients.

Treatments 
During the first 16-week treatment period, patients were randomised in a double-blind 1:1 ratio to 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID or matching placebo BID. At the Week 16 visit, all patients, including those who were 
randomised to placebo, received open label tofacitinib 5 mg BID for the remaining 32 weeks of the study 
period.  
Prior and Concomitant Treatments 
Patients continued their stable background AS therapy, which included NSAIDs including selective COX-2 
inhibitors, MTX, sulfasalazine, and corticosteroids.  
Methotrexate was allowed if it had been used for at least 4 months, on a stable dose (≤25mg/week) 
during the last 4 weeks. Sulfasalazine was allowed if used for at least 2 months, on a stable dose (≤
3g/day) during the last 4 weeks. Patients who were already receiving oral corticosteroids must be on a 
stable dose of ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for 1 week before baseline. Topical NSAIDs were 
allowed during the study. 
Daily dosages of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors, opioids, and paracetamol must be stable for 1 week prior to 
first study dose and must remain so during the study treatment period (Week 48) except if adjustment is 
needed to protect a subject’s safety. The total daily dose of acetaminophen may not exceed 2.6 grams 
per day, and the total daily dose of opioid may not exceed the potency equivalent of 30 mg of orally 
administered morphine. 
Rescue medications  
The maximum dose of acetaminophen/paracetamol was 2.6 g/day for no more than 10 consecutive days. 
The maximum dose of opioids was the maximum potency equivalent of 30 mg/day of orally
administered 
morphine (with or without acetaminophen/paracetamol) for no more than 10 consecutive days (Table 
29). Subjects who were not on stable, background opioid therapy, any of single opioid agents (e.g., 
‑
hydrocodone, oxycodone or tramadol) could be given as rescue medication (with or without 
acetaminophen/paracetamol) for no more than 10 consecutive days. Subjects who required rescue 
medication for more than 10 consecutive days were discontinued from the investigational product. In 
addition, subjects were not dosed with rescue acetaminophen/paracetamol or opioids within 24 hours 
prior to a study visit.

Rescue therapy 
Increases of acetaminophen/paracetamol and opioids were allowed as rescue medication for no more than 10 
consecutive days. 
Acetaminophen/paracetamol were added or increased to a maximum of 2.6 gm/day.  
Opioids were added or increased to a maximum potency equivalent of 30 mg of orally-administered morphine.  
Subjects who required rescue for more than 10 consecutive days were discontinued from the study.  
There was no limit to the duration of nonconsecutive use of rescue medications.  
Subjects were not dosed with rescue medication during the 24 hours prior to a study visit. 
Baseline stable use acetaminophen/paracetamol or opioids were not discontinued in advance of study visits. 
Subjects were not dosed with rescue acetaminophen/paracetamol or opioids within 24 hours prior to a study 
visit.  
A3921120 
Baseline stable acetaminophen/paracetamol or opioids was not discontinued in advance of study visits. 
Increases of acetaminophen/paracetamol and opioids were allowed as rescue medication for 
 no more than 10 consecutive days.  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol was added or increased to a maximum of 2.6 gm/day. 
Combination products such as over-the-counter “cold remedies” or pain medications were assessed for 
acetaminophen/paracetamol content so that the total dose will not exceed 2.6 gm/day.  
Opioids were added or increased to a maximum potency equivalent of 30 mg of orally-administered morphine. 
Subjects who required rescue for more than 10 consecutive days were discontinued from the 
investigational product and designated as discontinued from the investigational product 
for lack of efficacy.  
There was no limit to the duration of nonconsecutive use of rescue medications.  
Subjects were not dosed with rescue medication during the 24 hours prior to a study visit.  
In the judgement of the investigator, if rescue therapy had any effect on efficacy data collected during a study 
visit, this constituted a protocol deviation. 
Baseline stable use of acetaminophen/paracetamol or opioids was not discontinued in 
advance of study visits.

Treatment compliance 
At the study visits, sufficient investigational product was dispensed to complete dosing until the next 
scheduled visit and all study medication had to be returned at each visit. Compliance was assessed by pill 
count at each visit. If compliance was <80% the patient was offered counselling to improve compliance. 
If a patient was less than 80% compliant as assessed at two consecutive visits, the patient was 
withdrawn from investigational treatment. 
Discontinuation Criteria from the Investigational Product: 
  serious or significant opportunistic infections, other serious or severe AEs  
  defined alterations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, Hb, PLT, AST/ALT +/- hepatic injury, creatinine,

ASAS20 Response  ASAS20 assesses 4 domains: the Patient Global 
Assessment of Disease, Spinal Pain (total back pain), 
Function (BASFI) and Inflammation (average of 
questions 5 and 6 of BASDAI). ASAS20 response is 
defined as an improvement from Baseline ≥20% and ≥1 
unit in at least 3 domains on a scale of 0 to 10 and no 
worsening of ≥20% and ≥1 unit in the remaining 
domain.

∆ASDAS(CRP)a 
At Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 
32, 40, and 48 
The ASDAS(CRP) endpoint is derived from several 
patient-reported outcomes (Back Pain, Duration of 
Morning Stiffness, Patient Global Assessment, and 
Peripheral Pain/Swelling) and hsCRP and was 
calculated by the Sponsor. The following formula was 
used to calculate the ASDAS(CRP): 
∆hsCRP 
∆ASQoL 
∆SF-36v2 
ASDAS(CRP) = 0.121 × Back Pain + 0.058 × Duration 
of Morning Stiffness + 0.110 × Patient Global + 0.073 × 
Peripheral Pain/Swelling + 0.579×Ln (hsCRP mg/L+1) 
Blood samples were analysed by a central laboratory.  
The ASQoL is an 18-item patient-completed 
questionnaire assessing the amount of restriction the 
patient is experiencing in daily activities, level of pain 
and fatigue, and the impact on the patient’s emotional 
state. Each item is scored as 0 (no impact) or 1 (yes - 
impact). A total score was calculated by summing the 
items. The total score ranges from 0 to 18, with higher 
values indicating more impaired health-related quality of 
life. 
The SF-36 (Acute) is a 36-item patient-completed 
generic health status measure. It measures 8 general 
health domains (norm-based scores were used in 
analysis): physical functioning, role limitations due to 
physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, 
vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to 
emotional problems, and mental health. These domains 
are also summarised as physical and mental component 
summary scores (PCS and MCS, respectively). Higher 
scores indicate better health outcomes. PCS was a Type 
I error-controlled endpoint.

∆FACIT-F 
Description 
The BASMI was used to assess the axial status and 
mobility (cervical, dorsal and lumbar spine, hips and 
pelvic soft tissue). Five clinical measures comprise this 
scale and in this clinical study the linear function 
method was used. The combined index score was 
calculated by the Sponsor using the individual scores 
from the following measures: lateral spinal flexion, 
tragus to wall distance, lumbar flexion (modified 
Schober), maximal intermalleolar distance, and cervical 
rotation. 
The FACIT – Fatigue Scale is a patient completed 
questionnaire consisting of 13 items that assess fatigue. 
Instrument scoring yields a range from 0 to 52 for the 
total score, with higher scores representing better patient 
status (less fatigue). FACIT-F is also summarised as 
FACIT-F experience domain score (range 0-20) and 
FACIT-F impact domain (range 0-32) score. FACIT-F 
Total score was a Type I error-controlled endpoint.

∆BASFI 
Patients assessed their overall disease activity over the 
last week using a NRS between 0 (Not Active) and 10 
(Very Active) to the question, “How active was your 
spondylitis on average during the last week?” PGA is 1 
of the 4 ASAS20/ASAS40 components and the results 
of this assessment were used to calculate the ASAS 
improvement criteria. 
Two NRS scales were used to assess the patient’s spinal 
pain: level of nocturnal pain and total back pain on 
average during the last week. For each of these scales, 
patients marked their level of pain on a 0 to 10 NRS 
anchored by 0 for “No Pain” to 10 “Most Severe Pain.” 
Results of total back pain were used to calculate the 
ASAS improvement criteria. The total back pain was a 
Type I error-controlled endpoint. 
Inflammation is 1 of the 4 ASAS20/ASAS40 
components, which is the average of the answers to 
questions 5 & 6 of BASDAI. 
The BASFI is a set of 10 questions designed to 
determine the degree of functional limitation in those 
with AS. The first 8 questions consider activities related 
to functional anatomy. The final 2 questions assess the 
patients’ ability to cope with everyday life. A 0‑10 NRS 
is used to answer the questions with 0 being “Easy” and 
10 being “Impossible.” BASFI is the average of these 10 
scores and it ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores 
indicating greater functional limitation. BASFI is 1 of 
the 4 ASAS20/ASAS40 components.

specifically lateral spinal flexion (from the BASMI). 
Response is defined as improvement ≥20% in at least 5 
domains

Description 
The chest expansion (cm) was measured as the 
difference between maximal inspiration and expiration. 
Two attempts were performed and the better (ie, larger) 
of the 2 attempts was utilised for data analysis. 
The BASDAI is a validated patient-completed 
questionnaire that consists of 6 questions pertaining to 
the 5 major symptoms of AS: fatigue; spinal pain; 
peripheral arthritis; enthesitis, intensity of morning 
stiffness and duration of morning stiffness. Each 
question was rated using a NRS from 0 (none) to 10 
(very severe). The BASDAI score was calculated by 
computing the mean of questions 5 and 6 and adding it 
to the sum of questions 1 to 4. This score was then 
divided by 5. 
The ASDAS Clinically Important Improvement, Major 
Improvement and Inactive Disease were calculated from 
the ASDAS(CRP) data. Clinically important 
improvement and major improvement were defined as a 
decrease from Baseline in ASDAS(CRP) ≥1.1 units and 
≥2.0 units, respectively. Inactive disease was defined as 
ASDAS(CRP) <1.3 unit. 
Enthesitis was evaluated by the qualified blinded 
assessor using the MASES. Thirteen sites (right and left) 
were assessed for tenderness: costochondral 1 (right and 
left), costochondral 7 (right and left), spina iliaca 
anterior superior (right and left), crista iliaca (right and 
left), spina iliaca posterior (right and left), processus 
spinosus at L5 and Achilles tendon proximal insertion 
(right and left). Scoring at each site will be 0 for no 
tenderness or 1 for tenderness. 
Forty-four (44) joints were assessed for swelling and 
included the following: sternoclaviculars, 
acromioclaviculars, shoulders, elbows, wrists, 
metacarpophalangeals (MCP I, II, III, IV, V), thumb 
interphalangeal (IP), proximal interphalangeals (PIP II, 
III, IV, V), knees, ankles, and metatarsophalangeals 
(MTP I, II, III, IV, V). 
The EuroQol 3 Levels EQ-5D-3L Health State Profile is 
a patient completed instrument designed to assess 
impact on health-related quality of life in 5 domains: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression with lower scores indicating better 
health outcomes. EQ-VAS (Your own health state 
today) records the patient’s self-rated health, a score 
ranging from 0 to 100 mm is recorded, with higher 
scores representing better health state today  
The WPAI: Spondyloarthritis is a 6-item patient-
completed questionnaire that is specific for 
spondyloarthritis which yields 4 types of scores: percent 
work time missed due to health problem; percent 
impairment while working due to health problem; 
percent overall work impairment due to health problem; 
percent inactivity due to health problem. WPAI 
outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages with 
higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less 
productivity.

a. Per the method published by Machado et al3, for hsCRP values < 2 mg/L, it is set to 2 mg/L in the formula to derive 
ASDAS(CRP) and endpoints based on ASDAS(CRP). 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy analysis is to compare the ASAS20 response rate at week 16 of the tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID  and  placebo  via  the  normal  approximation  for  the  difference  in  binomial  proportions.  Assuming  a 
placebo response rate of 40% for ASAS20 response at week 16, a sample size of 120 per arm will yield 
about 89% power to detect a difference of at least 20% between tofacitinib 5 mg BID and placebo at a two-
sided significance level of 5%. In the Phase 2 proof of concept trial A3921119, ASAS20 response rates at 
week 12 were 63% and 40% for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and placebo, respectively. 
Sample  size  calculation  for  pivotal  phase  III  study  A3921120  was  based  on  the  response  rate  found  in 
phase 2 dose-ranging, proof of concept trial. It is recognized as appropriate, although the primary efficacy 
endpoint was then analysed by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the randomization 
strata (prior treatment history). 
Randomisation 
By use of an automatic Interactive web-based Response system. Subjects were randomized at the 
Baseline visit in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two parallel blinded treatment sequences for a total of 
16 weeks of treatment. Randomization was stratified by prior treatment history: (1) bDMARD-naive and 
(2) TNFi-IR or bDMARD use (non-IR) as shown in Table 32. The clinical trial was designed to reflect the 
proportion of bDMARD-naïve and TNFi-IR or bDMARD use (non-IR) of approximately 80%/20%.  
Table 32. Safety Analysis Set (Final Analysis)

Page 68/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At  the  end  of  the  16  weeks  double-blinded  treatment  period,  all  subjects  were  assigned  to  open-label 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID to Week 48. The investigators, subjects and sponsor study team remained blinded to 
the first 16 weeks of treatment assignment through the entire duration of the trial until database release. 
The randomisation scheme is considered adequate. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was subject-, investigator-, and sponsor-blinded. An IRT drug management system was used 
to dispense the bottles with medication at each visit from baseline to week 40, using unique container 
numbers. For the open-label treatment period, subjects, investigator and sponsor study team remained 
blinded to the double-blind treatment period study sequence. All subjects received tofacitinib 5 mg tablets 
supplied in containers labelled according to local regulatory requirements.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis of efficacy parameters 
Full Analysis Set: The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized subjects who received at least one 
dose of the randomized investigational product (i.e., tofacitinib or placebo).  
Per  Protocol  Analysis  Set:  The  Per-Protocol  (PP)  analysis  set  excluded  all  subjects  who  had  a  protocol 
deviation The PP analysis set was used as a supportive analysis for the primary endpoint of ASAS20 and 
the key secondary endpoint of ASAS40. 
There were 2 planned analyses: Week 16 Analysis (data cut-off 19DEC2019, data snapshot 29JAN2020) 
and Week 48 Analysis following the final database release.  
The Week 16 Analysis included all placebo-controlled efficacy data through Week 16.  The Week 48 analysis 
results, which contained placebo-controlled results through Week 16 as well as open-label results post-
Week 16, were secondary and supportive in nature. 
All statistical tests were conducted on a 2 sided 5% significance level for comparing tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
to placebo. Type I error was controlled on a 2-sided 5%.  
For the primary endpoint of ASAS20 response at Week 16, if the 2-sided p-value was ≤5%, the superiority 
of tofacitinib 5 mg BID to placebo was declared and the primary objective of the study was considered as 
being met. 
Estimands for ASAS20 and ASAS40 at Week 16 
Only discontinuation of the investigational product was considered as an intercurrent event to define the 
estimands for this study. There are three estimands for the primary endpoint of ASAS20 at Week 16. 
Estimand 1: 
The  first  estimand  of  ASAS20  at  Week  16  is  a  composite  estimand  that  accounts  for  both  treatment 
adherence  and  response.  A  responder  is  defined  as  having  a  response  without  discontinuation  of  the 
investigational product prior to Week 16.  
Estimand 2: 
The second estimand of ASAS20 at Week 16 is supportive to Estimand 1 and is a treatment policy estimand. 
It estimates the effect regardless of treatment adherence.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 69/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Estimand 3: 
The third estimand of ASAS20 at Week 16 is supportive to Estimand 1 and is a hypothetical estimand. It 
estimates  the  treatment  effect  as  if  the  intercurrent  event  of  discontinuation  of  investigational  product 
prior to Week 16 has not occurred.  
The  main  difference  between  Estimand  1  and  3  is  that  Estimand  3  assumes  the  intercurrent  event  of 
discontinuation of investigational product prior to Week 16 has not occurred, while Estimand 1 considers 
the response after discontinuation of investigational product as non-response via the composite strategy. 
Also, the population-level summary in Estimand 3 is an odds ratio instead of difference in response rates 
as in Estimand 1. 
Similarly, the same three estimand are also applicable to ASAS40 at Week 16. Specifically, Estimand 1 for 
ASAS40  at  Week  16  is  called  the  Key  Secondary  Estimand,  defined  according  to  the  key  secondary 
objective. Estimand 1 was also used for other binary secondary endpoints. 
Estimands for Continuous Secondary Endpoints 
Only discontinuation of the investigational product was considered as an intercurrent event to define the 
estimands for this study. Estimand 4, a hypothetical estimand was used for other continuous secondary 
endpoints  thatestimates  the  treatment  effect  as  if  the  intercurrent  event  of  discontinuation  of 
investigational product prior to Week 16 has not occurred 
Estimand 5 was used only for the Type I error controlled continuous secondary endpoints as supportive 
analyses to Estimand 4 and is a treatment policy estimand. 
Estimand 4: 
The difference between Estimand 5 and 4 is that Estimand 5 disregards treatment adherence and includes 
the additional data collected after the intercurrent event of discontinuation of the investigational product 
prior to Week 16, ie, On-Study data are used. 
Primary  analysis:  For  the  primary  analysis  of  the  ASAS20  response  at  Week  16,  the  normal 
approximation  for  the  difference  in  binomial  proportions  adjusting  for  the  stratification  factor  (ie,  prior 
treatment history: "bDMARD naïve" versus "TNFi IR or bDMARD Use [Non-IR]") at randomisation via the 
CMH approach was used to test the superiority of tofacitinib 5 mg BID to placebo and to generate a 95% 
CI for the difference on the FAS. 
. ASAS40 response at Week 16 was analysed using the same methods as those for the primary endpoint 
ASAS20 response, as well as other binary endpoints. 
Continuous endpoints were analysed as change from baseline with a mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM).  
When analysis included only a single post-baseline visit, these endpoints were analysed as change from 
baseline with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included treatment group, stratification factor 
(i.e., prior treatment history), and baseline value. 
For both MMRM and ANCOVA, if the Baseline was missing or if there were no post-baseline measurements, 
the patient was excluded from the analysis. In the final analysis, all data up to Week 48 were included in 
the analyses using another MMRM.  
A tipping point analysis for the primary endpoint of ASAS20 and the key secondary endpoint of 
ASAS40 was conducted to address impact of missing values on the conclusions and to assess the 
robustness of the data; it was based on multiple imputation.  
Analysis at week 48 
At week 16 all subjects have been assigned to open-label tofacitinib until week 48. Both primary and 
secondary endpoints have been analysed by the same models used until week 16 but extending visits 
until week 48. As the primary endpoint (ASAS20), the key secondary endpoint (ASAS40), and the other 
Type I error controlled secondary endpoints were at week 16, there was no additional adjustment made 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 70/215 
 
 
 
 
 
for Type I error rate at the final analysis at week 48. The week 48 contains results for earlier visits and 
serves as sensitivity analysis only to ensure there were no major changes to the definitive results for the 
primary and key secondary endpoints obtained at week 16.

For the Phase III study, all statistical tests were conducted at the 2-sided 5% significance level for 
comparing tofacitinib 5 mg BID to placebo. The family-wise Type I error rate has been controlled at the 2-
sided 5% significance level using a step-down.  
The method is not very rigorous, since the alpha level for each comparison is fixed at the 2-sided 5%. 
In Study A3921120, 5 estimands were defined for the efficacy endpoints. The discontinuation of the 
investigational product was considered as an intercurrent event for the respective definitions.  There were 
3 estimands for the primary endpoint of ASAS20 response at Week 16 and the key secondary endpoint of 
ASAS40 response at Week 16. Estimand 1 included only on-drug data and was the main estimand; 
Estimand 2 included on-study data; Estimand 3 assumed the intercurrent event had not occurred and 
included only on-drug data. Both Estimands 2 and 3 were supportive estimands. Two additional 
estimands, Estimand 4 (main) and Estimand 5 (supportive) were used for continuous secondary 
endpoints. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Five hundred and fifty-six AS patients were screened globally. A total of 270 eligible patients were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 2 parallel treatment groups

Of the 270 randomised patients, 1 patient was randomised to tofacitinib 5 mg BID in error by the site but 
did not receive study drug, thus was excluded from all analyses. There were 269 patients included in the 
FAS. Overall, 9 (3.3%) patients discontinued from the study drug; 4 (3.0%) from tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
and 5 (3.7%) in the placebo treatment group up to Week 16. Subject disposition Up to Week 16 and 48 is 
presented in Figures 19 and 20 respectively.

Percentages for the ‘Not treated’ and ‘Treated' rows are calculated using the number of patients assigned to 
treatment (randomised) as the denominator. Other percentages are calculated using the number of ‘Treated’ 
patients as the denominator. 
Discontinuations due to AE and discontinuations due to insufficient clinical response refer to discontinuation of 
study drug and not discontinuation of study participation. 
Based on the Week 48 Analysis data. 
A total of 269 patients in the A3921120 were treated and included in the FAS and 133 received tofacitinib 
5 mg BID as shown in Table 34. 
Five hundred and fifty-six AS patients were screened and a total of 270 eligible patients were randomised 
(Tofacitinib 5 mg BID n = 134 and Placebo n = 136).  
Patient’s disposition was balanced across the study. The great majority completed the DIB 16 weeks 
phase (only 4 and 5 subjects discontinued study drug in the Tofa and PLB arm, respectively). A higher but 
similar number of subjects discontinued study drug up to 48 weeks: 15 in the Tofa-Tofa and 14 in the 
PLB-Tofa arm; the main reasons of discontinuation being the same safety and lack of efficacy although a 
higher number is registered in the Tofa-Tofa (8 and 6, respectively) as compared to PLB-Tofa (3 and 4) 
group.   
Recruitment 
Study Centers: A total of 57 sites randomized subjects from the following countries: Australia (3), 
Bulgaria (2), Canada (2), China (5), Czech Republic (3), France (1), Hungary (2), Republic of Korea (3), 
Poland (9), Russian Federation (6), Turkey (4), Ukraine (5), United States (12). 
Conduct of the study 
Amendments 
Amendment 1, 06 September 2018 main changes: 
1.  Clarified  the  role of  ASAS40  response  at 16  weeks  as  a  key  secondary  endpoint.  Replaced  ΔSF-
36v2 Physical Functioning domain by ΔSF-36v2 PCS as a Type I error-controlled endpoint. Added 
ΔASQoL as an additional Type I error-controlled endpoint. Moved AS-HCRU  from a secondary to 
tertiary endpoint. 
2.  Added  Inflammation,  Patients  Assessment  of  Spinal  Pain  and  PGA  to  the  secondary  endpoints. 
Clarified the BASMI secondary endpoint includes the 5 components. Realigned secondary endpoints 
to be consistent with the statistical testing (ie, Type I error control). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 75/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Updated sections based upon FDA feedback for subject discontinuation of investigational product 
and withdrawal from study. 
4.  Inclusion criteria #7 updated the definition of inadequate response and clarified the definition of 
intolerance. 
5.  Updated inclusion criteria #9 (Subject must be on a stable dose of corticosteroids for 1 week prior 
to first dose of investigational product). 
6.  Updated  exclusion  criteria  #5  to  exclude  targeted  synthetic  DMARDs  (including  tofacitinib)  and 
subjects  that  have  been  previously  exposed  to  conventional  synthetic,  targeted  synthetic,  or 
biological DMARDs 
Amendment 2 10 April 2019 main changes: 
1.  Changed to not exclude subjects with prior bDMARD use (non-IR) based on the available population 
to improve the recruitment in the study. 
2.  Moved the ASQol in sequence for global type 1 error control before the SF-36v2 PCS. Added the 
FACIT-F Total score to the global type I error control scheme. 
Amendment 3 03 April 2020 main changes: 
This global amendment incorporates venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factor checks. Pfizer has 
determined  that  VTE  is  identified  as  an  important  identified  risk/dose  dependent  adverse  drug 
reaction for tofacitinib. 
A summary of important protocol deviations is presented in Table 35: 
• 
• 
There  was  a  similar  proportion  of  subjects  with  protocol  deviations  in  both  treatment 
groups. 
The majority of the protocol deviations occurred in the category of procedures/tests and 
concomitant medications with the most common being efficacy assessment/procedure not 
performed at appropriate visits.

Impact of COVID-19 
In  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  a  PACL  was  approved  on  30  March  2020  that  outlined  the 
administrative changes that were implemented to clarify study procedures during the pandemic. 
The COVID-19 pandemic impact of protocol changes due to the deviations on the data quality, data analysis 
or conclusion was minimal as the majority of patients had completed study participation prior to start of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Amendments have been done basically to refine the endpoints and their hierarchy; another important 
point was the inclusion of bDMARD non-IR subjects. No impact on study results is foreseen.

Prior Treatments 
NSAIDS 
Most  (99.6%)  subjects  received  prior  NSAIDs  such as  diclofenac,  celecoxib  and  meloxicam  and  a  minor 
rate  of  patients  received  corticosteroids  (16%),  the  most  of  which  were  oral  corticosteroids  (13%). 
However, it was noted that a higher number of subjects was treated with corticosteroids in tofacitinib 5 mg 
(19.5%) compared to placebo group (12.5%) both with oral and intrarticular administration, suggesting 
possible  more  severe  manifestations.  Moreover,  this  imbalance  was  mainly  observed  in  highly  treated 
patients (TNFi-IR and bDMARD use), in which a higher percentage of subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
group (19.4%) compared to placebo (6.5%) had prior use of oral corticosteroids and this is expected likely 
due to a more difficult to treat disease. No important differences were reported in previous csDMARDs use 
that was similar between tofacitinib and placebo group (57.1% vs 59.6%). The majority of patients were 
bDMARDs naïve (77%) with a similar distribution between the two groups. A minor number of patients (31 
subjects  in  each  arm,  23%)  were  bDMARDs  experienced  (bDMARDs  use  or  TNFi-IR),  2  subjects  were 
bDMARDs use non-IR.; 1 subject did not take NSAIDs due to prior medical history.

Corticosteroid 
• 
Prior corticosteroid use for the bDMARD naïve strata was similar, 12.7% in the tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID group compared with 13.3% in the placebo group. In the TNFi-IR and bDMARD  
(non-IR) strata, a higher percentage of subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (19.4%) compared 
to placebo (6.5%) had prior use of oral corticosteroids. 
DMARDs 
A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  received  prior  DMARDs  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  most  frequently 
received prior csDMARD (approximately 50% in each treatment group) was sulfasalazine (Table 40). 
Table  40  shows  the  most  frequently  received  prior  csDMARD  (approximately  50%  in  each  treatment 
group) was sulfasalazine.

bDMARDs 
The percentage of bDMARD naïve or TNFi-IR or bDMARD use (non-IR) subjects were similar between 
treatment groups. The most frequently received prior bDMARDs (approximately 10% in each treatment 
group) were etanercept and adalimumab (Table 41). 
Table 41. 
•  All  subjects  had  received  bDMARDs  included  in  the  category  of  TNFi.  There  were  43  (72.9%) 
subjects with 1 prior TNFi-IR and 16 (27.1%) subjects 2 prior TNFi-IR 
• 
• 
The most frequently received prior bDMARDs (approximately 10% in each treatment group) were 
etanercept  and  adalimumab.  The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  in  the  majority  of 
bDMARDs was lack of efficacy. 
There were 2 subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID treatment group and 1 subject in the placebo 
group  with  prior  use  of  1  bDMARD  (non-IR).  These  subjects  had  bDMARD  use  with  the 
discontinuation reason of other, not due to either AE or lack of efficacy. 
Concomitant Rescue Medications

- 
- 
- 
The most common rescue medication in either treatment group Day 1 up to Week 16 and Day 1 up 
to Week 48 was paracetamol (2.2% and 2.6% of subjects, respectively) 
The  most  common  NSAIDs  used  throughout  the  study  were  celecoxib  and  meloxicam, 
approximately 16% and 18% of all subjects, respectively 
The  most  common  concomitant  corticosteroids  taken  at  baseline  (Day  1  only)  and  Day  1  up  to 
Week 16 were methylprednisolone (3.7% of subjects for both) and prednisone (1.5% and 1.9% of 
subjects, respectively) 
The most common concomitant corticosteroids taken Day 1 up to Week 48 were dexamethasone 
(2.2% of subjects), methylprednisolone (4.1% of subjects), and prednisone (1.9% of subjects) 
The  most  common  concomitant  csDMARD  in  both  treatment  groups  (approximately  20%  of 
subjects) throughout the study was sulfasalazine 
Concomitant  rescue  medications,  NSAIDs,  oral  corticosteroids,  intra-articular  corticosteroids,  and 
csDMARDs were taken by a similar proportion of subjects between treatment groups at baseline up to Week 
48. A higher percentage of subjects with any csDMARDs was observed in placebo group than in tofacitinib 
group (33% vs 22%) probably reflecting a higher number of patients with a history of peripheral arthritis

The study met the primary endpoint, tofacitinib 5 mg BID demonstrated superiority over placebo in ASAS20 
response at Week 16 (p <0.0001) (as shown in Table 43). ASAS20 response was a global Type I error-
controlled endpoint.  
Table 43. ASAS20 Response Rate at week 16, Treatment Comparison -Estimand 1, FAS, On-Drug 
Date, MR=NR- Primary Anslysis (Week 16 Analysis) 
The results from pre-specified supportive analyses for ASAS20 response at Week 16 i.e. tipping analysis 
for different scenarios of missing responses in both arms were consistent with the primary analysis. 
A summary of subjects was produced based on on-drug data for those who completed the Week 16 visit by 
their  ASAS20  response  status  at  Week  16  and  those  who  discontinued  from  the  investigational  product 
prior to the Week 16 visit by their reason of discontinuation (estimand 1) are provided below (Table 44). 
The summary for the on-study data (Estimand 2 as shown in Table 44) was consistent with the on-drug 
data.

Subgroup Analysis for the Primary Endpoint 
Subgroup comparisons for ASAS20 response at Week 16 were made on the FAS with missing values handled 
by MR=NR using the on-drug data corresponding to Estimand 1. Subgroup comparisons were not Type I 
error-controlled. 
The efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg BID versus placebo for ASAS20 responses at Week 16 was consistent across 
different subgroups examined with the exception of some which were smaller in size (Figure 21). 
• 
For the subgroup of prior treatment history (bDMARD naïve and TNFi-IR or bDMARD use [Non-IR]), 
ASAS20 response rate of tofacitinib 5 mg BID was greater than that of placebo at Week 16 in both categories 
(Figure 21.

Key Secondary Endpoint Result – ASAS40 Response Rate at Week 16 
The study met the key secondary endpoint, tofacitinib 5 mg BID demonstrated superiority over placebo in 
ASAS40  response  at  Week  16  (p  <0.0001)  (Table  46).  ASAS40  response  was  a  global  Type  I  error-
controlled endpoint.

• 
The efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg BID versus placebo for ASAS40 responses at Week 16 was consistent 
across different subgroups examined except for baseline weight in the category of >100 kg, likely 
due  to  small  sample  size.  The  ASAS40  response  rates  for  tofacitinib  5  mg  BID  were  greater 
compared to placebo for the subgroups except for baseline weight in the category of >100 kg. 
For the subgroup of prior treatment history (bDMARD naïve and TNFi-IR or bDMARD use [Non-IR]), 
ASAS40 response rate of tofacitinib 5 mg BID was greater than that of placebo at Week 16 in both 
categories.

Despite the limited sample size, the MAH was requested to include results according to bDMARDs naïve 
orTNF-IR subjects/bDMARD use subgroups in section 5.1 of the SmPC, in order to guide prescribers. The 
issue resolved and section 5.1 of the SmPC were updated accordingly. 
Secondary Endpoints Results 
Table 48 presents the results of primary endpoints and selected secondary endpoints of the study. 
Primary and key secondary endpoints are reported above in the AR.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints supported the primary findings:  
• 
Tofacitinib 5 mg BID demonstrated superiority to placebo in signs and symptoms as well as 
health-related outcomes, based on the mean changes from baseline in ASDAS(CRP), hsCRP, ASQoL, SF-
36v2 PCS, BASMI Score (Linear Method), and FACIT-F Total Score at Week 16. 
• 
Tofacitinib 5 mg BID demonstrated superiority to placebo in mean change from baseline in each 
of the 4 ASAS components: PGA, Total Back Pain, BASFI (physical function), and Inflammation at Week 
16 (all p<0.0001; Table 48). 
• 
Tofacitinib 5 mg BID also demonstrated superiority to placebo at all timepoints through Week16 
for ASAS20 response rates (Figure 5). In addition, tofacitinib 5 mg BID demonstrated superiority to 
placebo at all timepoints through Week 16 except Week 2 for ASAS40 response rates (Figure 21).

• 
For most of the secondary efficacy endpoints not controlled for Type I error, including SF-
36v2 Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, and Social Functioning domains, 
the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group showed greater numerical increases over placebo at Week 16 (Table 48). 
• 
Tofacitinib 5 mg BID demonstrated sustained efficacy in ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates 
(Figure 5, Figure 6, and Table 7) and other secondary endpoints (ASDAS(CRP), hsCRP, ASQoL, SF-36v2 
[PCS, Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, and Social Functioning domains], 
BASMI Score (Linear Method), FACIT-F Total Score, PGA, total back pain, BASFI, and inflammation) over 
time up to Week 48 (Table 7).

The  efficacy  for  the  ASAS20  and  ASAS40  response  rates  were  increased  at  Week  24  (first  post-placebo 
assessment) for tofacitinib 5 mg BID in patients who started placebo and advanced to tofacitinib at Week 
16 (Figure 23 and Figure 24). This was maintained over time up to Week 48 in these patients (Figure 
23 and Figure 24).

Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score using C-Reactive Protein Change from Baseline 
Change from baseline in ASDAS(CRP) at Week 16 was a global Type I error-controlled endpoint. 
- The LS mean change from baseline in ASDAS(CRP) showed a statistically significant decrease for tofacitinib 
5 mg BID compared to placebo at Week 16 (p <0.0001) based on the MMRM analysis (Estimand 4)  
- The LS means decrease from baseline in ASDAS(CRP) for tofacitinib 5 mg BID were greater than those of 
placebo at all other time points (2-sided 95% CI excluded 0). 
- Results of the supportive analysis (MMRM, Estimand 5, FAS, on-study data, no imputation) were consistent 
with the on-drug data  
- Results were consistent for ASDAS(CRP) derived using hsCRP 2 mg/L as minimum for values of hsCRP 
less than 2 mg/L  
High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) Change from Baseline 
Change from baseline in hsCRP at Week 16 was a global Type I error-controlled endpoint. 
- The LS mean change from baseline in hsCRP showed statistically significant decreases for tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID compared to placebo at Week 16 (p <0.0001) based on the MMRM analysis (Estimand 4)  
- The LS means decrease from baseline in hsCRP for tofacitinib 5 mg BID were greater than those of placebo 
at all other time points (2-sided 95% CI excluded 0). 
- Results of the supportive analysis (MMRM, Estimand 5, FAS, on-study data, no imputation) were consistent 
with the on-drug data. 
Many secondary endpoints (21, 1 key) controlled for multiplicity (step-down testing procedure with a 
fixed alpha level for each comparison at the 2-sided 5%) were selected by the MAH.

Key secondary endpoint 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)(CRP):  The ASDAS is a composite index that 
combines the following 5 disease activity variables:  spinal pain (BASDAI Question 2 NRS score 0 – 10), 
peripheral joint pain/swelling (BASDAI Question 3 NRS score 0 – 10), duration of morning stiffness 
(BASDAI Question 6 NRS score 0 – 10), PtGA, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).  Higher 
scores indicate more active disease. 
ASDAS (CRP) the LS mean change from baseline in ASDAS(CRP) showed a statistically significant 
decrease for tofacitinib 5 mg BID compared to placebo at Week 16 (-1.36 in the tofa arm and -0.39 in the 
PLB arm at week 16, delta of -0.98, p <0.0001, FAS on drug data estimand 4), the achieved difference 
was clinically relevant. Consistent results were shown by the supportive analysis (MMRM, Estimand 5, 
FAS, on-study data, no imputation) were consistent with the on-drug data.  
At week 48 improvement of ASDAS(CRP) from baseline is still seen in both arms similarly -1.70 and -1.50 
for the TOFA-TOFA and PLB-TOFA, respectively. 
Secondary endpoints type I controlled:  
In the hierarchical order as second endpoint the MAH selected the Change from baseline of an 
inflammatory marker i.e., hsCRP at Week 16 showing statistically significant decreases for tofacitinib 5 
mg BID compared to placebo at Week 16 (-1.05 versus -0.09, p <0.0001) based on the MMRM analysis 
(Estimand 4). Importantly this endpoint is not considered key for demonstration of tofacitinib clinical 
benefit but only regarded as supportive for effect on inflammation since no data support this biomarker 
as useful surrogate to assess efficacy in axial SpA.  
Secondary endpoints but not controlled for type I error:  
-ASDAS clinically important improvement (61.3 versus 19.1 delta 42.3), ASDAS major improvement (30 
versus 4.6 delta 25.3) ASDAS inactive disease (6.7 versus 0 delta 6.7) at week 16 overall showing a 
greater response in the Tofa arm which is maintained at week 48 and with an effect size of clinical 
significance for endpoint measuring improvement. Low disease activity or partial remission endpoints: 
ASDAS inactive disease (6.7 versus 0 delta 6.7, p 0˂0.05) at week 16 and ASAS partial remission (a 
value of =2 (on a 0 to 10 scale) present in each domain, 15 versus 3, p 0˂0.001) showing very/limited 
effect size. 
-ASAS 5/6 results are consistent with those of the primary and key secondary endpoint showing a 
statistical and clinical relevant improvement (44% responders, delta of 36 at week 16 and maintained at 
week 48). 
As measure of improvement of enthesitis the MAH had included the change in MASES index (total score 
ranging 0 – 13) at week 16 as not controlled secondary endpoint showing an improvement of -2 versus -
1.41, delta of -0.53 slightly increasing at week 48.  
Other measures of symptoms and physical function recommended which has been included within 
secondary endpoints not controlled for multiplicity is the change of BASDAI at week 16 (showing an 
improvement of -2.55 at week 16 delta of -1.44), however i) this is a widely used measure of disease 
activity and its changes with treatment should be assessed as secondary endpoint; ii) the percentage of 
patients with clinical response as measured by an improvement of at least a 50% from the baseline score 
in BASDAI is considered useful to judge the clinical benefit of a treatment and was not included by the 
MAH. 
Ancillary analyses 
Combination With csDMARDs Versus Monotherapy  
In Study A3921120, the efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg BID versus placebo for ASAS20 response rate at Week 
16 was consistent between patients who were receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID as monotherapy and those 
receiving  tofacitinib  5  mg  BID  with  concomitant  csDMARDs  However,  the  magnitude  of  the  ASAS20

response  rate  was  greater  with  concomitant  csDMARD  use.  The  efficacy  of  tofacitinib  5  mg  BID  versus 
placebo  for  ASAS40  response  rate  at  Week  16  was  consistent  between  patients  who  were  receiving 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID as monotherapy and those receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID with concomitant csDMARDs 
and again the magnitude of the response rate was greater with Day 1 concomitant csDMARD use (Table 
49).

Table 50 CMH Normal Approximation to ASAS40 Response Rate at Week 16 by Subgroup, Treatment Comparison - 
Estimand 1, FAS, On-Drug Data, MR=NR- Subgroup Analysis (Week 16 Analysis) 
The ASAS20 and ASAS40 respones are higher in tofacitinib 5 mg BID compared to placebo group both in 
patients with concomitant csDMARDs use that in those with not (as shown in Tables 49 and 50). It is 
noted that the magnitude of the effect of tofacitnib is slightly greater when using concomitant csDMARDs 
compared to monotherapy (diff. of 30.88 vs 26.76 for ASAS20 and 31.41 vs 27.56 for ASAS 40 
response), even though the number of patients with concomitant csDMARDs treatment (tofa: 29, PLB: 
44) is limited compared to that of patients in monotherapy (tofa: 104, PLB: 92).  
Efficacy in the Pivotal Study A3921120 Beyond Week 16 
The efficacy of the tofacitinib IR for AS is based on the Week 16 data analysis and supplemented by the 
Week 48 data analysis from Study A3921120. As previously described, all patients in this study received 
active treatment of tofacitinib 5 mg BID after Week 16. Therefore, no placebo data are available after this 
time point.  
The efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg BID as measured by ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses are shown over the 
full  48-week  treatment  period  in  the  study  (Figure  5  and  Figure  6  above).  The  ASAS20  and  ASAS40 
response rates were sustained for tofacitinib 5 mg BID after Week 16 to the end of the study (Week 48). 
In addition, as measured by type-I error-controlled secondary endpoints (ASDAS(CRP), hsCRP, ASQoL, SF-
36v2  PCS,  BASMI  Score  (Linear  Method),  FACIT-F  Total  Score,  PGA,  total  back  pain,  BASFI,  and

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The Applicant has submitted a report concerning a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-
controlled trials of EMA-approved biological DMARDs, including ASAS20/40 at week 12-16, in patients 
with AS with or without previous experience with biological DMARDs. 
Placebo-controlled RCTs of biological DMARDs approved for AS by the EMA were included if they reported 
ASAS20 or ASAS40 at 12-16 weeks and included patients with prior nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) failure. Only multicenter studies were included and studies conducted in single countries were 
excluded. The initial search was conducted up to August 2019 and was recently refreshed up to August 
2020. The studies concerning tofacitinib were studies A3921119 and A3921120 discussed in this report. 
ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates were extracted from the study reports, and from the AS subgroup in 
trials conducted in the SpA population. The mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses between intervention arms and placebo were calculated, using ITT data. 
The results were depicted using forest plots, for all trials separately. 
According to the results, ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses (Figure25) for tofacitinib 5 mg BID across Studies 
A3921119 and A3921120, were similar compared with adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, 
infliximab, ixekizumab and secukinumab. The treatment effects on ASAS40 were 26% and 28% in the two 
tofacitinib trials (Figure 25), while the majority of treatment effects of the other biological DMARDs ranged 
from  17%  (adalimumab,  COAST  V)  to  37%  (infliximab,  ASSERT).  One  of  the  secukinumab  trials  with  a 
loading and a non-loading treatment arm versus placebo, had lower treatment effects (MEASURE 4).

A3921119  
This was Phase 2, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging, parallel group 
efficacy and safety study designed to characterise the dose-response of tofacitinib in patients with active 
AS who had experienced an inadequate response to NSAIDs and were naïve to previous bDMARDs (Figure 
26)for design schematic).

Methods 
Study participants 
The clinical programme was designed to evaluate the efficacy of tofacitinib in adult patients with active 
AS who had experienced an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to NSAID therapy. A diagnosis 
of AS was based on the Modified New York Criteria for AS (1984). Active disease was also defined as: 
BASDAI score of ≥4 and back pain score (BASDAI Question 2) of ≥4 despite treatment with NSAIDs at 
both screening and baseline. Patients met the definition of NSAID-IR if they had either an inadequate 
clinical response, intolerance to at least 2 different oral NSAIDs, or ongoing NSAID treatment but with 
active AS. 
Patients continued their stable background AS therapy, which included NSAIDs including selective COX-2 
inhibitors, MTX, sulfasalazine, and corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent). In Study 
A3921119, background therapies were to be stable for 4 weeks except NSAIDs (1 week) prior to the first 
dose of investigational product. 
Selected key enrolment criteria for Study A3921119 are the same of the pivotal phase study with the 
exception of exclusion of subjects exposed to bDMARDs.   
Treatments 
A twice daily dosing regimen (3 doses of tofacitinib 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or placebo) was evaluated in the 
dose-ranging Phase 2 Study A3921119. During the 12-week treatment period, patients were randomised 
in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of the 4 blinded treatments. The assignment occurred according to a 
randomisation schedule and to which the patient, site personnel, and the Sponsor’s personnel directly 
involved in the study conduct were blinded through the entire duration of the study. 
The duration of participation for eligible patients was approximately 150 days. This included a screening 
period of approximately 28 days, a 12-week double-blind treatment period, and a 28-day follow-up 
period. 
Of 445 subjects screened for entry into the study, 208 subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
double-blind treatment; 52 subjects to each treatment group (tofacitinib 2 mg BID, tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and placebo). 
The efficacy of Tofacitinib 5 mg BID dose was supported by the outcomes of the Phase 2 dose-ranging 
Study A3921119. The study design is considered appropriate and in line with the EMA guideline 
(EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 1*) recommendation for placebo controlled parallel group studies. 
Similar eligibility criteria were applied across the two key studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
overall appropriate reflecting subjects with AS who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. 
However, differently to Study A3921120, only patients naïve to previous bDMARDs were allowed to be 
included in Study A3921119, excluding patients bDMARDs experienced. Therefore, the phase 2 study 
could be of support of tofacitinib treatment only in a bDMARD naïve patient population. The activity of 
disease required for entry into this study was defined as for the pivotal on: Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis 
Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score of ≥4 and back pain score (BASDAI Question 2) of ≥4 despite 
treatment with NSAIDs (or intolerance to NSAIDs). Regarding the different doses, the MAH states that 
similar to the RA and psoriasis Phase 2 studies, where inclusion of doses <5 mg BID provided lower 
efficacy thereby allowing a complete characterization of the dose-response curve, a 2 mg BID dose was 
included in the study.

Objectives 
1. To compare the efficacy of tofacitinib, in doses of 2 mg twice daily (BID), 5 mg BID, 10 mg BID versus 
placebo  on  the  ASAS20  response  rate  at  Week  12  in  subjects  with  active  AS  that  had  an  inadequate 
response to previous treatment. 
2. To estimate the placebo-corrected dose-response for the ASAS20 at Week 12 in subjects with active AS 
that had an inadequate response to previous treatment. 
3. To compare the safety of tofacitinib at all doses versus placebo in all study subjects. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ASAS20 response rate at 12 weeks of treatment. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  A validated endpoint such as Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) MRI index 
of disease activity score and/or modified Berlin Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (ASspiMRI) Activity Score of the SI joints and spine at Week 12. 
•  ASAS20 response at all other time points (2,4 and 8 weeks). 
•  ASAS40 response at all time points (2,4,8 and 12 weeks). 
•  ASAS 5/6 response at all time points (2,4,8 and 12 weeks). 
•  ASAS partial remission criteria at all time points (2,4,8 and 12 weeks). 
•  Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) using C-Reactive Protein 
(ASDASCRP) at all time points (2,4,8 and 12 weeks). 
•  ASDAS clinically important improvement, ASDAS major improvement and ASDAS inactive disease 
at all time points (2,4,8 and 12 weeks). 
•  BASDAI at all time points (2,4,8 and 12 weeks). 
•  50% improvement from Baseline in the BASDAI (BASDAI50) response at all time points (2,4,8 
and 12 weeks). 
•  BASFI at all time points (2,4,8 and 12 weeks). 
•  BASMI at all time points (2,4,8 and 12 weeks). 
•  Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score (MASES) at all time points collected (4,8 and 
12 weeks) 
• 
Extra-articular involvement (specific medical history and peripheral articular involvement [as 
assessed by swollen joint count]) at all time points collected (2,4,8 and 12 weeks). 
Other evaluations included QoL endpoints: Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL), Short-Form-36 
Health Survey (SF-36) Version 2, EuroQol Health State Profile – 5 Domains (EQ-5D), Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment 
(WPAI) Questionnaire: Spondyloarthritis, AS HealthCare Resource Utilization Questionnaire (AS-HCRU). 
The efficacy of tofacitinib in active AS in phase 2 Study was evaluated using a core set of validated 
measures similar to those used in the pivotal Study and this is agreed. However, the primary endpoint 
(ASAS20) was assessed at week 12 instead of at week 16 as in Study A3921120 not allowing for a 
pooling of efficacy results. As reported in the above comment for Study A3921120, ASAS 20 is not the 
preferred primary endpoint according to EMA guideline (EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 1*) that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 104/215 
 
 
 
 
recommends to use the more stringent endpoint ASAS40 as primary. However, due to the reasons 
explained above and considering this as a supportive study, ASAS20 is deemed an acceptable endpoint. 
Moreover, ASAS40 response is one of the secondary end-point together with other validated endpoints 
such as ASAS 5/6, ASAS partial remission, ASDAS (CRP), BASDAI improvement, BASDAI 50. It is also 
noted that a radiological endpoint is also included (SPARCC) and this is agreed according to EMA GL.  
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the 4 blinded treatments (tofacitinib 2 mg 
BID, tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, or placebo BID as shown in Table 52). Tofacitinib was 
provided as 1 mg or 5 mg tablets with corresponding matching placebo. A total of 8 tablets per day 
encompassed the total daily dose taken by the subject: 
Table 52. Treatment Allocation 
Selection of Doses in the Study 
The 5 and 10 mg BID doses were demonstrated to be efficacious in RA subjects and in subjects with 
psoriasis. Since 10 mg BID provided increased efficacy over 5 mg BID in RA and psoriasis while 
maintaining an acceptable safety profile, and doses >10 mg BID did not provide substantially improved 
efficacy, 10 mg BID was selected as the highest dose for the current study. Similar to the RA and 
psoriasis Phase 2 studies, where inclusion of doses <5 mg BID provided lower efficacy thereby allowing a 
complete characterization of the dose-response curve, a 2 mg BID dose was included in the study. 
Rescue medications:  
The maximum dose of acetaminophen/paracetamol was 2.6 g/day for no more than 10 consecutive days. 
The maximum dose of opioids was the maximum potency equivalent of 30 mg/day of orally
administered 
morphine. 
Sample size 
‑
Sample size was assessed using clinical trial simulations in which a dose-response model (the 3-
parameter maximal effect [Emax] model) determined the true percentage of ASAS20 responders at week 
12. Simulations under several plausible truths were conducted assuming 50 subjects per treatment group 
to evaluate the operational characteristics of this same model when used for the analysis. If the true 
placebo-corrected ASAS20 response in the range of 1 to 10 mg BID was between 20 to 40%, then it was 
projected based on simulations that the estimated placebo-corrected effect for that dose ±10%, would 
capture the true placebo-corrected response at least 83% of the time. Under the same assumption about 
the true effect, it was projected that the estimated placebo-controlled effect ±5% would capture the true 
value at least approximately 50% of the time. 
Emax model to the primary endpoint was used for the dose–response study A3921119. It is recognised to 
find the optimal dose and investigate the relationship between dose and efficacy relative to control.

Randomisation 
A total of 208 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive tofacitinib 2 mg BID, tofacitinib 5 
mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, or placebo. 
Blinding (masking) 
The Study was conducted in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner. The randomization scheme is 
considered adequate.  
Statistical methods: 
A 3-parameter Emax model to estimate the ASAS20 dose-response at Week 12, the primary efficacy 
endpoint, with missing response considered as non-response. As a supportive analysis, the normal 
approximation for estimating the difference in binomial proportions was used to compare each of the dose 
groups of tofacitinib to placebo at Week 12 with missing response considered as non-response. All 
analyses of the efficacy endpoints were based on the FAS. Evaluation of secondary efficacy endpoints was 
either by: 
The normal approximation for the difference in binomial proportions (both testing and confidence interval) 
was applied to the following endpoints: 
•  ASAS20 response at all other time points. 
•  ASAS40 response at all time points. 
•  ASAS 5/6 response at all time points. 
•  ASAS partial remission criteria at all time points. 
•  ASDAS clinically important improvement, ASDAS major improvement and ASDAS inactive disease 
at all time points. 
•  BASDAI50 response at all time points. 
Missing values due to dropout were set to non-responsive and mixed LOCF was used for missing data that 
may have existed in components of the above endpoints. 
A repeated measures model was used to analyze change from Baseline for the endpoints listed below. The 
marginal repeated measure model included fixed effects of treatment group, visit, and treatment-group by 
visit  interaction,  and  Baseline  value.  An  unstructured  variance  covariance  matrix  was  used.  Pairwise 
comparisons  of  each  tofacitinib  dose  to  placebo  (providing  both  2-sided  p-values  and  95%  confidence 
interval) at each post-Baseline time point was generated from contrast statements using this model. 
•  ASDASCRP at all time points. 
•  BASDAI at all time points. 
•  BASFI at all time points. 
•  BASMI (linear method) at all time points. 
•  MASES at all time points collected. 
• 
Extra-articular  involvement  (specific  medical  history  and  peripheral  articular  involvement  [as 
assessed by swollen joint count]) at all time points collected. 
•  Spinal mobility at all time points collected 
• 
Total score on the FACIT-F at all time points.

An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to analyze change from Baseline for the endpoints 
listed  below.  The  ANCOVA  model  included  a  fixed  effect  for  treatment  group  and  Baseline  value  as  a 
covariate. Pairwise comparisons of each tofacitinib dose to placebo (providing both 2-sided p-values and 
95% confidence interval) were generated from contrast statements using this model. 
• 
Total score on the ASQoL at Week 12. 
•  Summary components and domains of the SF-36 Version 2, Acute at Week 12. 
•  Domains and utility index from the EQ-5D at Week 12. 
•  WPAI Questionnaire: spondyloarthritis at Week 12. 
•  A validated endpoint such as SPARCC MRI index of  disease activity score and/or modified Berlin 
ASspiMRI Activity Score of the SI joints and spine at Week 12. 
The Early Termination visit value was used as the Week 12 value if the Week 12 value for a subject was 
missing. 
The use of the Emax model as primary analysis to estimate the ASAS20 dose-response at Week 12, and 
the  use  of  the  normal  approximation  as  supportive  analysis  for  estimating  the  difference  in  binomial 
proportions to compare each of the dose groups of tofacitinib to placebo at Week 12 are acknowledged.  
Participant flow 
The duration of participation for eligible patients was approximately 150 days. This included a screening 
period of approximately 28 days, a 12-week double-blind treatment period, and a 28-day follow-up 
period. Table 53 summaries patient dispositions for Studies A3921119 up to week 12.  
Of 445 subjects screened for entry into the study, 208 subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
double-blind treatment; 52 subjects to each treatment group (tofacitinib 2 mg BID, tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and placebo).

completed the study; approximately 98% of patients in the lower dose treatment groups (tofacitinib 2 mg 
and 5 mg BID) compared to approximately 90% in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID and placebo treatment 
groups. 
Recruitment 
Study A3921119 
Study initiation date: 17 April 2013 
Completion date: 18 March 2015 
Conduct of the study: One amendment to the study A3921119 protocol was planned; the implemented 
changes seem do not impact study results, and no significant concern has been identified. 
Baseline data  
Patient baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar across all treatment groups. The 
overall mean age was 41.6 years. The majority (82.7%) of patients in the study were White and 3.8% of 
patients were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patients were from the EU (61.8%), Asia (18.8%), North 
America (13.5%), and the ROW (5.8%). Patients were balanced across treatment groups in their 
corticosteroid (3.8% to 17.3%) and DMARD (34.6% to 55.8%) use at baseline. The mean (median) 
duration since diagnosis of AS for the 5 mg BID treatment group was 6.3 (3.5 [range: 0.0-24.4]) years 
and was similar across treatment groups.  
Medical history  
Table 54. Medical History Related to Primary Diagnosis – Safety Analysis Set 
Few patients (7 treated and 4 placebo) discontinued the Study A3921119, of which the majority in 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID arm, and 94-96% of subjects were included in the Per-protocol analysis set. 
Overall, demographic characteristics were quite balanced across groups and similar to those of phase 3 
study. The majority of subjects in all treatment groups were white males HLA-B27 positive; the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 108/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proportion of subjects positive for HLA-B27 was greatest in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID treatment group. 
The baseline disease characteristics were compatible with the diagnosis of active AS disease indicated by 
a median value of 6.2 in tofa 5 mg BID and 6.6 in placebo group for BASDAI and of 3.7 and 3.5, 
respectively in ASDAS (CRP). A slightly higher median baseline hsPCR value was observed in tofa 5 mg 
BID group (8.74) compared to placebo group (6.91). A higher number of patients in tofa 5 mg BID group 
compared to placebo group had a history of IBD, psoriasis and peripheral articular involvement. 
Results 
Results of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 12 were as follows:

The primary analysis of the ASAS20 response rate at Week 12 was conducted on the FAS using 
an Emax model with MR=NR (as shown in Table 55). The estimated response rates were 40.1% for 
placebo and 56.0%, 63.0%, 67.4% for tofacitinib 2, 5, and 10 mg BID, respectively, demonstrating that 
the response rates for tofacitinib were higher than for placebo.  
Table 55. Analysis of ASAS20 Response Rate at Week 12 Using Emax Model, Comparison to Placebo – 
Full Analysis Set.  
The ASAS20 response rate at Week 12 with missing response as non-response was 41.2% for placebo 
and 51.9%, 80.8%, 55.8% for tofacitinib 2 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg BID, respectively (as shown in Table 
56); the difference in response rates by normal approximation method between tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 
placebo was statistically significant (p<0.001, without multiple comparison adjustment).

Table 56. Normal Approximation to ASAS20 Response at Week 12, Comparison to Placebo – Full Analysis 
Set NRL/LOCF.  
The ASAS20 response rate in tofacitinib 5 mg BID was higher than placebo at Week 4 (55.8% versus 
33.3%; p≤0.05 without multiple comparison adjustment). 
• 
At Week 12, there was a statistically significant higher ASAS40 response rate for tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID compared with placebo: 21.6% for placebo and 42.3% (p=0.020), 46.2% (p=0.006), and 38.5% 
(p=0.057) for tofacitinib 2, 5, and 10 mg BID, respectively (without multiple comparison adjustment). 
• 
At Week 12, all ASAS family components showed greater mean reductions from baseline for 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID versus placebo (2-sided 95% CI for the difference between tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 
placebo excluded 0). 
• 
At Week 12, there was a statistically significant greater improvement from Baseline for the LS 
mean SPARCC MRI index of disease activity score of the SI joints and the spine and for the LS mean 
modified Berlin ASspiMRI Activity Score compared to placebo for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID (Table 57).

In the Phase 2 dose-ranging Study A3921119, at Week 12 patients with active AS receiving tofacitinib 2 
mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg IR BID had a respective estimated ASAS20 response rate of 56.0%, 63.0%, or 
67.4% compared to an estimated placebo response rate of 40.1% (primary analysis using an Emax 
model). Therefore, only the tofacitinib 10 mg BID treatment group met pre-specified statistical decision 
rules for the primary endpoint of the ASAS20, with an estimated difference from placebo of 27.3%, a 
20.3% difference for the lower bound of the 2-sided 60% credible interval, and a 33.0% difference for the 
upper bound of the 2-sided 50% credible interval. Results from supportive analysis using the normal 
approximation method showed the ASAS20 response rate of 51.9%, 80.8%, 55.8% for tofacitinib 2 mg, 5 
mg, and 10 mg BID, respectively, and 41.2% for placebo. Only the difference between tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID and placebo was statistically significant (p<0.001). Across most of the secondary endpoint pertaining 
to disease activity and physical functions, health related outcomes and radiological progression, tofacitinib 
5 mg showed to be more effective than placebo, supporting results from phase 3 pivotal study. Regarding 
spinal mobility, which is an important efficacy parameter to support ASAS as primary endpoint (see also 
comment above on pivotal study), a major change in Linear BASMI Score at week 12 was observed in 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (-0.39) compared to placebo group (-0.15) which however did not reach the 
statistical significance, as well as the other spinal mobility score used to evaluate chest expansion (0.49 
vs 0.31). Moreover, for other more stringent endpoint at week 12 such as ASAS partial remission, ASDAS 
major improvement and ASDAS inactive disease for tofacitinib 5 mg BID there were no statistically 
significant differences from placebo, although a slightly greater response rate was observed.  
Additional supportive studies 
The Applicant has submitted a report summarising the existing scientific evidence on the development 
and psychometric properties of three patient reported outcomes: ASQoL, SF-36v2, FACIT-F (Table 55). 
These three outcomes were included in the set of secondary outcomes subjected to the hierarchical 
testing procedure for control of global type-I error in the pivotal study A 391120 (Table 58) The concept 
and psychometric properties of the ASQoL and of the FACIT-F for use in AS is presented below. Similar 
results supporting the reliability, validity and sensitivity to change of the SF-36 in AS were also prepared 
by the MAH but are not reproduced in this section.

Patient reported efficacy outcomes in study A3921120. 
ASQoL 
The  ASQoL  is  an  18-item  PRO  questionnaire  to  assess  QoL  impacts  specific  to  AS  (Figure  29).  It  was 
originally developed in the United Kingdom through qualitative, unstructured interviews and focus groups 
with patients to ensure that the content was relevant and covered issues of importance to AS patients. 
Figure 29 
Overview of the ASQoL items 
The ASQoL leads to a single total score. Each ASQoL statement is given a score of 1 = Yes or 0 = No, 
with an answer of ‘Yes’ indicating adverse QoL. All item scores are summed to give a total score 
ranging from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL). For respondents with one to three missing responses (no 
more than 20% missing), a total score can still be calculated, based on the nonmissing items. The 
ASQoLhas been fitted to the Rasch Measurement Model to allow for parametric statistical analyses (the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 114/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rasch model was not applied in the analyses for study A3921120). The ASQoL is completed previous to 
the clinical visit, on paper with a pen/pencil, and generally takes less than 10 minutes for respondent to 
complete. 
The internal consistency or item-scale correlation of the ASQoL is good with high values for Cronbach’s 
α in several studies (Table 59). 
Table 59 
Internal consistency of the ASQoL 
The  test-retest  reliability,  preferably  analysed  using  intraclass  correlation  coefficients  (ICC)  is  high  in 
several studies-and-languages/cultures (Table 60). 
Table 60 
Test-retest reliability of the ASQoL 
The construct validity of the ASQoL (Table 61) was assessed by relating scores to the Nottingham Health 
Profile (NHP) and self-perceived severity of illness. Moderately high Spearman rank correlation coefficients 
were  seen  between  the  ASQoL  and  NHP  section  scores:  energy  levels  (0.80),  pain  (0.77),  emotional 
reactions (0.66), sleep disturbance (0.59), social isolation (0.62), and physical mobility (0.87).

Table 61 
Construct validity of the ASQoL 
Evidence of sensitivity to change is found in several clinical trials. In a clinical trial for adalimumab (van 
der Heijde 2015) the MID was defined as a decrease of ≥1.8 points on the ASQoL. This definition was also 
used in a clinical trial for certolizumab pegol (Sieper 2015). The ASQoL has since been used in Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and EMA labelling claims for adalimumab and certolizumab pegol. Thus, although 
the  MID has  not  been  explicitly  mentioned  in the labels,  this  change  provides  a  precedent,  a  threshold, 
which should be expected for an efficacious drug endpoint, and can support interpretation of the ASQoL 
instrument in a clinical trial for AS. 
Additional data on the ability of the ASQoL to detect change between groups in placebo-controlled trials 
with FDA and EMA-approved drugs are: secukinumab (Deodhar 2016), certolizumab pegol (Sieper 2015), 
tofacitinib and adalimumab (Strand 2019). 
FACIT-F 
The FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire to asses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities 
and  function.  It  is  a  subset  of  items  from  the  larger  47-item  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy 
Anaemia  (FACT-An)  that  is  comprised  of  the  27-item  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy  General 
(FACT-G) and a 20-item anaemia subscale. The FACT-An, from which the FACIT-F is derived, was developed 
in  1994  to  1995  for  cancer-related  anaemia  over  a  series  of  four  phases:  item  generation  involving 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 116/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interviews  with  patients  and  medical  experts;  item  review  and  selection,  involving  additional  interviews 
with medical experts; scale construction; and psychometric evaluation (Cella 2012; FACIT.org). 
The FACIT-F uses a five-point Likert scale for all items (where 0=Not at all, 1=A little bit, 2=Somewhat, 
3=Quite a bit, and 4=Very Much) and has a recall period of “the past 7 days.” Thus, each FACIT-F item is 
scored from 0 to 4; higher scores indicate lower fatigue. 
Three endpoints can be derived from the FACIT-F: the FACIT-F total score, the FACIT-F experience domain 
score, and the FACIT-F impact domain score (Figure 30). The FACIT-F total score is calculated by summing 
the 13 items and ranges from 0 to 52. If there are missing items and more than 50% of the items were 
answered (i.e., at least seven of 13 for the FACIT-F total score, at least three of five for FACIT-F experience 
domain  score,  and  at  least  five  of  eight  for  the  FACIT-F  impact  domain  score),  then  the  score  can  be 
considered valid. 
Figure 30 
FACIT-F overview of items, subscales and total score 
The FACIT-F was originally developed to assess fatigue in cancer patients that resulted from 
chemotherapy regimens or a corresponding anaemia. Regarding content validity, the development 
process ensured that the fatigue subscale items covered concepts relevant to fatigue in general. The 
development process included item generation with patients and medical experts, item selection, 
psychometric testing and item reduction and validation. 
Up to now, the FACIT-F was used in one EMA labelling claim for secukinumab in AS. In the initial study for 
FACIT-F development, convergent and divergent validity of the FACIT-F in testing to differentiate patients 
by haemoglobin level and patient-rated performance status was demonstrated (Cella 2012; FACIT.org). 
Data regarding the psychometric properties of the FACIT-F in AS is found in several studies (tables 
below). 
The internal consistency, or item-scale correlation, of the FACIT-F, as shown in the tofacitinib studies in 
this application and three other studies in patients with Psoriatic Arthritis is good, with high levels of 
Cronbach’s α (Table 62).

Internal consistency of the FACIT-F 
The test-retest reliability of the FACIT-F was assessed in the current tofactitinib trials using the baseline 
and week 2 data, and in some other trials in patients with anaemia and in patients with Psoriatic Arthritis. 
The intraclass correlation coefficients point to good test-retest reliability (Table 63). 
Table 63 
Test-retest reliability of the FACIT-F 
The construct validity in patients with AS has been assessed in the two current trials with tofacitinib 
and in two other trials in AS. Medium to high-sized correlation coefficients were found for relations with 
other patient assessed questionnaires assessing related outcomes: ASQoL, SF-36, ASAS20, VAS pain, 
PGA (Table 64).

The sensitivity to change of the FACIT-F was confirmed in several recent placebo-controlled trials in AS 
(secukinumab, Deodhar 2016), and in PsA (tofacitinib, Strand 2019a, Strand 2019b, Gladman 2017; 
golimumab, Krüger 2018). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
With this submission, the MAH seeks a new indication for Tofacitinib for the treatment of adult patients 
with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. The 
recommended dose of tofacitinib is 5 mg administered twice daily.  
In support of the sought indication the MAH is providing i) supportive data from Study A3921119 a phase 
2, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose ranging, parallel group efficacy and 
safety study designed to characterize the dose response of tofacitinib 2 mg BID, 5 mg BID and 10 mg 
BID in patients with active AS who had experienced an inadequate response to NSAIDs and were naïve to 
previous bDMARDs; dose of 5mg BID was selected; ii) confirmatory evidence from one pivotal study 
A3921120, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group comparing tofacitinib 
5mg dosed twice daily to placebo in subjects with active AS, who had experienced an inadequate 
response to NSAIDs (NSAID-IR) and were additionally either naïve to previous bDMARDs, or TNFi-IR or 
experienced to previous bDMARDs but without inadequate response (bDMARD Use [Non-IR]).  The study 
design included a 16-week double-blind treatment period, a 32-week open-label treatment period (all 
subjects were assigned to open-label tofacitinib 5 mg BID to Week 48) and a 28-day follow-up period 
(duration of participation for eligible subjects was approximately 56 weeks). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 121/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The design of the pivotal study could be acceptable, however since tofacitinib belongs to a new 
therapeutic class for the AS indication and the study includes biological naïve patients a three-arm trial 
(including an accepted active comparator) would have been recommended as per the EMA guideline on 
the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal products for the treatment of Axial Spondyloarthritis 
(EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 1*), particularly for assessing a relative B/R balance. However, the 
MAH has performed a meta-analysis of approved treatments and also included the results of the 
tofacitinib trials (dose-finding and pivotal study) as supportive data. 
The duration of the maintenance period is in line with the guideline although a longer OL period would 
have been recommended for assessing structural changes. Dose reduction/changing dose interval in 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients after resolution of inflammation following tofacitinib treatment has 
not been evaluated and that there are no data supporting changing dose interval, which has been 
acceptable.  
The study included subjects with active AS defined as: Modified New York Criteria for Ankylosing 
Spondylitis (1984), BASDAI score of ≥4 and back pain score (BASDAI Question 2) of ≥4 at both 
screening and baseline and that have had an inadequate response to at least 2 different NSAIDs. 
Additionally, bDMARD naïve, TNFi-IR, or bDMARD (non-IR) exposed were enrolled in this study. 
Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria are adequate for selecting an active AS population and also for 
taking into account the safety profile of the drug.  
The proportion of bDMARD-naïve and TNFi-IR or bDMARD use (non-IR i.e., discontinued the bDMARD due 
to other reasons than lack of efficacy or intolerance) was of approximately 80%/20%. Randomization was 
stratified by prior treatment history: (1) bDMARD-naive and (2) TNFi-IR or bDMARD use (non-IR).  
Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate for selecting an active AS population and also for 
taking into account the safety profile of the drug. From the Clinical Overview and from what can be 
derived from clinicaltrials.gov, it appears that no studies with tofacitinib in patients with non-radiographic 
axial spondyloarthritis are being performed.  Upon request the MAH specified that at present there are no 
plans to conduct tofacitinib studies for patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and therefore 
will not be applying for this sub-indication/therapeutic claim. Moreover, criteria for defining previous or 
concomitant allowed, or prohibited therapies and stable doses are considered acceptable. The MAH 
specified the criteria for using rescue therapy in both studies. The agents allowed 
(acetaminophen/paracetamol, opioid agents) were used primarily to relieve pain conditions and it seems 
to be unlikely that they could have affected the clinical course or the outcome of the disease, also 
considering that subjects were not dosed with rescue medication during the 24 hours prior to a study visit 
and that a small number of subjects used rescue therapy. 
The study evaluates 1 primary endpoint, 1 key secondary endpoint, and other 20 secondary endpoints; 
moreover, the statistical analysis includes 3 estimands for binary endpoint, and 2 estimands for 
continuous secondary endpoints. This choice is considered suboptimal. A statistical planning more 
focussed on the relevant estimations by using more robust approaches would have been preferable.  
The primary endpoint of the study was ASAS20 response at week 16. This is not in line with the current 
Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  Axial  Spondyloarthritis 
(EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 1*) stating that the ASAS 40 response is preferred primary endpoint 
for biological medicinal products or products from a new therapeutic class, as a higher magnitude of the 
clinical response are expected. It is disappointing that the MAH did not seek advice to EMA on this choice 
nor  considered  a  separate  statistical  analysis  plans  (SAPs),  each  using  the  endpoint  preferred  by  the 
approving regulatory agency.  ASAS40 was therefore defined as key secondary endpoint.  
The use of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the randomization strata (bDMARD-naïve, 
TNFi-IR or bDMARD use) for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (ASAS20) is acknowledged. 
Numerous secondary endpoints have been proposed. However, the established hierarchy and the absence 
of some important endpoint   assessing the clinical benefit of the drug as also clearly recommended in the

EMA GL is not completely understood. Analyses of key secondary endpoints using MMRM or ANCOVA models 
are recognized as adequate. 
It should be noted that no endpoint that could monitor structural changes, as highly recommended in the 
EMA GL was included.  
The MAH justified the lack of endpoints monitoring structural changes in Study A3921120 stating that the 
study design for Study A3921120 was not considered of sufficient duration to provide evidence of 
structural changes relative to placebo using radiography (modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal 
Score [mSASS]) given that the placebo period was only of 16 weeks duration and the entire treatment 
duration was 48 weeks.  
Sample size calculation for pivotal phase III study A3921120 was based on the response rate found in 
phase 2 dose-ranging, proof of concept trial. It is recognized as appropriate, although the primary 
efficacy endpoint was then analysed by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the 
randomization strata (prior treatment history).  
A total of 269 patients in the A3921120 were treated and included in the FAS and 133 received tofacitinib 
5 mg bid. Patient’s disposition was balanced across the study.  The great majority completed the DB 16 
weeks phase. A higher but similar number of subjects discontinued study drug up to 48 weeks: 15 in the 
Tofa-Tofa and 14 in the PLB-Tofa arm; the main reasons of discontinuation being the same safety and 
lack of efficacy although a higher number is registered in the Tofa-Tofa (8 and 6, respectively) as 
compared to PLB-Tofa (3 and 4) group.   
Demographic and baseline characteristics were quite balanced between the two arms and representative 
of the target population i.e., active AS.  The majority of patients were white males with a mean age of 41 
years. Patients from Europe were adequately represented being about 40% although enrolment was 
exclusively done in few countries.  
Enrolled subjects had an active disease status as well indicated by a median value of 6.5 in BASDAI, of 
3.9 in ASDAS (CRP) and a Patient's Assessment of Total Back Pain (NRS) and nocturnal spinal pain of 7.  
An involvement of the spine as shown by the spinal mobility index BASMI (mean 4.5, range 0-10) and 
chest expansion (mean 3, range 0-12, enthesis involvement in roughly 50% of subjects and swollen 
joints in slightly less than 30% and impaired quality of life i.e., ASQoL (mean 11-11.5, range 0-18). 
Considering ASDAS (CRP) score, the majority of patients (66.5%) had a very high disease activity 
[ASDAS (CRP) >3.5] with an imbalance between tofacitinib and placebo group with a slightly higher 
number of patients (70.6%) with very high disease activity as compared to tofacitinib group (62.4%). 
According to the more recent EULAR management recommendations for axial spondyloarthritis (2016), 
ASDAS is considered a relevant measure to assess disease activity (it correlates far better with both 
patients’ and physicians’ level of disease activity) and an elevated ASDAS index is considered more 
predictive of a good response than an elevated BASDAI. Therefore, the higher representativeness of 
subjects with very high disease activity according to ASDAS(CRP) in the placebo arm could impact the 
response.  
Patients were generally balanced across treatment groups in their csDMARD (57.1% for tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID group to 60.3% for placebo group), oral corticosteroid (14.3% to 11.0%), and NSAID (100.0% to 
99.3%) use at baseline. The majority of patients were positive for HLA-B27 (87.4% of subjects) and the 
median AS diagnosis duration was of 4.9 years (range: 0.1, 42.8). 
A minority of patients had extra-articular manifestations at baseline. Regarding peripheral arthritis, the 
number of patients with current symptoms in tofacitinib and placebo groups were respectively 19 and 26 
corresponding to 86.4% and 89.7% of subjects with history of peripheral arthritis. Moreover, a higher 
percentage of subjects with any csDMARDs was observed in placebo group than in tofacitinib group (33% 
vs 22%) probably reflecting a higher number of patients with a history of peripheral arthritis (18.4% vs 
15.8%).   However, no meaningful differences were noted between patients with and without concomitant 
csDMARDs with regard to ASAS40 and ASDAS(CRP) endpoints as well as with and without swollen joints. 
A slightly higher response in ASAS20 endpoint, a less stringent endpoint, was observed in tofacitinib

group with concomitant csDMARDs (diff from plb: 30.88) compared to those without concomitant 
csDMARDs (diff from plb: 26.76), with the trend in favour of tofacitinib. 
Almost all patients (99.6%) received prior NSAIDs, and a minor rate of patients received corticosteroids 
(16%). However, it was noted that a higher number of subjects was treated with corticosteroids in 
tofacitinib 5 mg (19.5%) compared to placebo group (12.5%) both with oral and intrarticular 
administration, suggesting possible more severe manifestations. Moreover, this imbalance was mainly 
observed in highly treated patients (TNFi-IR and bDMARD use [non-IR]), in which a higher percentage of 
subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (19.4%) compared to placebo (6.5%) had prior use of oral 
corticosteroids and this is expected likely due to a more difficult to treat disease. No important differences 
were reported in previous csDMARDs use. The majority of patients were bDMARDs naïve (77%) with a 
similar distribution between the two groups. A minor number of patients (31 subjects in each arm, 23%) 
were bDMARDs experienced (bDMARDs use or TNFi-IR), 2 subjects were bDMARDs use non-IR.  
Concomitant rescue medications, NSAIDs, oral corticosteroids, intra-articular corticosteroids, and 
csDMARDs were taken by a similar proportion of subjects between treatment groups at baseline up to 
Week 48.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary endpoint: a statistically significant higher proportion of patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
group reached ASAS20 at week 16 in comparison to the placebo group (56.4% vs 29.4%, p<0.0001), 
with a treatment difference of 27.08 (95% CI: 15.89, 38.28), which is in line with the 20% difference 
expected in the sample size calculation. Moreover, the primary analysis is supported by results from all 
the pre-specified supportive analyses.  
ASAS20 is a weaker endpoint compared to the more stringent ASAS40, which is preferred by the EMA 
guidelines. The choice of ASAS20 has been discussed and agreed with FDA and not with EMA. ASAS40 
has been used as the key secondary endpoint and this was also met from a statistical perspective with a 
higher response rate of subjects in tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (40.6%) compared to placebo group 
(12.5%) at week 16 (difference of 28.17, 95% CI: 18.26, 38.09 p< 0.0001). The effect size being very 
similar to that observed for ASAS20. A post-hoc analysis for ASAS20 at week 16 has been provided for 
the main subgroups showing no important differences except for geographic region of North America in 
which a smaller difference between tofacitinib 5 mg and placebo is seen (however, the small sample size 
of this subgroup hampers any firm conclusion) and body weight. In the subgroup with a body weight 
>100 kg the estimate of the treatment effect based on ASAS40 was -13% in favour of placebo. The MAH 
considers that the trend of ASAS40 at Week 16 in the Study A3921120 participants with a body weight 
>100 kg is most likely explained by the small sample size (10 and 18 patients, respectively in placebo 
and tofacitinib groups). This was not seen in the subgroup analysis of body weight and ASAS20, where 
the treatment effect was 20% in patients >100kg, 27% in patients 60-100kg and 38% in patients <60kg. 
The treatment effect in the highest BMI classes was in line with the other results, for ASAS20 as well as 
ASAS40.  
Moreover, no major differences in tofacitinib exposure over the range of body weights studied were 
reported and no clinically significant decrease in efficacy of tofacitinib has been observed in >100 kg RA 
patients and according to SmPC section 5.2, systemic exposure (AUC) of tofacitinib in the extremes of 
body weight (40 kg, 140 kg) were similar (within 5%) to that of a 70 kg patient. Therefore, changes in 
the SmPC are not warranted at present.  
A higher efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg compared to placebo was observed in the subgroups with very high 
disease activity (ASDAS (CRP)>3.5) (∆ 35.43 vs 12.61 of patients with high disease activity) and higher 
baseline hsCRP (>2.87 mg/L) (∆ 28.95 vs 17.02 of patients with lower baseline hsCRP), suggesting that 
tofacitinib could perform better in this target population. The same figure was also observed for ASAS40 
endpoint.

For both ASAS20 and ASAS40 a better response rate between study drug and placebo is reported in 
bDMARDs naïve compared to TNF-IR subjects or bDMARD use [non-IR] (difference form placebo 28 
versus 22.5 and 28.4 versus 23 for ASAS20 and 40, respectively; in the TNF-IR or bDMARD use due to 
the limited sample size wide CI are seen); the better performance of the active drug is clinically expected 
in bDMARD naïve patients. Results according to bDMARDs naïve or TNF-IR subjects/bDMARD use [non-IR] 
subgroups have been included in 5.1 section of the SmPC, in order to guide prescribers.   
Many secondary endpoints (21, 1 key) controlled for multiplicity (step-down testing procedure with a 
fixed alpha level for each comparison at the 2-sided 5%) were selected by the MAH.  
Secondary endpoint: ASDAS (CRP) is a validated and accepted method to assess disease activity and 
physical function considered a very important disease activity score a clinically important improvement of 
≥1.1 is required to define a response. The LS mean change from baseline in ASDAS(CRP) showed a 
statistically significant decrease for tofacitinib 5 mg BID compared to placebo at Week 16 (-1.36 in the 
tofa arm and -0.39 in the PLB arm at week 16, delta of -0.98, p <0.0001, FAS on drug data estimand 4), 
the achieved difference was clinically relevant. Consistent results were shown by the supportive analysis 
(MMRM, Estimand 5, FAS, on-study data, no imputation) were consistent with the on-drug data.  
At week 48 improvement of ASDAS(CRP) from baseline is still seen in both arms similarly -1.70 and -1.50 
for the TOFA-TOFA and PLB-TOFA, respectively. 
However, as per EMA GL, to facilitate interpretation of the clinical relevance of the observed effect, 
responder analyses are preferable over mean absolute changes. The MAH has provided these analyses 
for secondary endpoints not controlled for type I error so results are only descriptive/supportive including 
ASDAS clinically important improvement (61.3 versus 19.1 delta 42.3), ASDAS major improvement (30 
versus 4.6 delta 25.3), ASDAS inactive disease (6.7 versus 0 delta 6.7) at week 16 overall showing a 
greater response in the Tofa arm which is maintained at week 48 and with an effect size of clinical 
significance for endpoint measuring improvement. In view of available treatments for ax SpA, disease 
remission is increasingly regarded as an appropriate therapeutic goal, no validate definition still exists. 
Therefore, endpoints aimed at assessing low disease activity or partial remission are considered of 
key importance for establishing the clinical benefit of a drug meant for axial SpA treatment as highlighted 
by EMA GL. ASDAS inactive disease (6.7 versus 0 delta 6.7, p 0˂0.05) at week 16  and ASAS partial 
remission (a value of =2 (on a 0 to 10 scale) present in each domain, 15 versus 3, p 0˂0.001) were 
assessed only as part of secondary not controlled endpoints showing very/limited effect size when 
inactive disease/partial remission was the goal, of interest is an increase of responders at week 48 
(roughly 13-15% for ASDAS inactive and 18-23% for ASAS partial remission. 
In the hierarchical order as second endpoint the MAH selected the Change from baseline of an 
inflammatory marker i.e., hsCRP at Week 16 showing statistically significant decreases for tofacitinib 5 
mg BID compared to placebo at Week 16 (-1.05 versus -0.09, p <0.0001) based on the MMRM analysis 
(Estimand 4). Importantly this endpoint is not considered key for demonstration of tofacitinib clinical 
benefit but only regarded as supportive for effect on inflammation since no data support this biomarker 
as useful surrogate to assess efficacy in axial SpA.  
Patient reported outcomes 
Descending in the established order there is the change in Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life 
(ASQoL) questionnaire (total scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores representing worse QoL) at 
week 16 showing an improvement at week 16 (tofa -4 versus PLB -2 and increasing at -6 and -5 at week 
48). The ASQoL is an AS specific QoL measure and improvement of this disease domain is within 
treatment objectives and as such patient reported outcomes and quality of life evaluation may also be 
considered as secondary endpoints as per EMA GL. The MAH gave priority to these QOL endpoints (3 out 
of 6 of type I controlled endpoints) over other endpoints. To support the validity of these three outcomes, 
the MAH has provided a study report summarising the psychometric properties of these QoL measures. 
These are used in SA and considered useful for the assessment of QoL, and overall results support 
clinically meaningful changes.

The inclusion among secondary endpoints (type I controlled) of a measure of spinal mobility i.e., 
BASMI: Linear BASMI (BASMI lin) composite score change at week 16, is supported being a relevant 
efficacy parameter in axial SpA. In particular, when ASAS is used as primary endpoint, as in this case, 
since this index does not include the assessment of the spine mobility should be supplemented with the 
assessment of spinal mobility as a secondary endpoint. Results showed a change at week 16 of -0.63 
versus -0.11 for Tofa and PLB, respectively; similar change (-0.6-0.7) at week 48 in both arms showing a 
statistical significance p 0.001 but not a clinically relevant difference for which improvement of > 1 point 
is expected. Another endpoint assessing spinal mobility i.e., change of spinal mobility (chest expansion, 
score 0-12) at week 16 was included with secondary endpoints not controlled for type I error showing a 
change of 0.59 versus 0.21 in the Tofa and PLB arm, not significant. Overall results on spinal mobility, 
which is an important domain of axSpA are not robust as those evaluating tofacitinib efficacy on sign and 
symptoms/inflammation of the disease.  
The individual components of the ASAS responses have been included within secondary endpoints 
(type I controlled) in general showing a consistent and similar (delta of -1.5-1.7 at week 16) 
improvement slightly higher at week 48 for all the components.  
ASAS20 and 40 responses over time: the onset of efficacy for tofacitinib 5 mg BID was seen early in 
the ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates. Tofacitinib 5 mg BID become superior to placebo at Week 2 for 
ASAS20 response rate and at Week 4 for ASAS40 response rate and was sustained after Week 16 to the 
end of the study (Week 48). However, a slightly decrease was noted at week 16 as compared to week 12, 
-7.5% for ASAS20 (from 63.91% at week 12 to 56.39 at week 16) and -2.3% for ASAS40, although 
subsequently increased again at week 24 reaching a plateau thereafter. The reduction observed at week 
16 has been clarified by the MAH by given a plausible response assuming that the observed trend was 
due to a random variability, since ASAS20 comprises subjective (patient-reported) components. However, 
it should be noted that a "real" decrease may have occurred. Moreover, considering the ASAS20 response 
rate, the same trend was observed with both Estimand 1 (on-drug data) and Estimand 2 (on-study data), 
with only 4/133 (3%) subjects discontinuing the investigational product; therefore, the intercurrent event 
of discontinuation which classifies the subject as non-responder for the visit of interest shouldn't have 
impacted the response rate at week 16. The issue was not further pursued. 
According to the ASAS40 and all other secondary outcomes over time, the effect was maintained. In the 
group that was originally allocated to tofacitinib, the ASAS40 response at week 16 was 41%, which 
increased to 50% at week 48. In the patient group that was on placebo at week 16 and switched to 
tofacitinib, the proportion of patients with an ASAS40 response increased over time to 45% at week 48. 
Nevertheless, the increasing response after week 16, the Applicant was asked to analyse the new 
occurrences of response over time, and to discuss the inclusion of a statement in the SmPC about when 
to stop tofacitinib if no response occurred. An update of the 4.2 section of the SmPC suggesting to 
carefully reconsidering to continue therapy in patients exhibiting no clinical improvement within 16 weeks 
was added. 
The EMA GL recommends using as secondary endpoints if not selected as primary endpoints, measures of 
disease activity such as the ASAS 5/6 as well as the peripheral tender joints and swollen joint count 
which were included by the MAH only as secondary (not controlled type I error) endpoints. ASAS 5/6 
results are consistent with those of the primary and key secondary endpoint showing a statistical and 
clinically relevant improvement (44% responders, delta of 36 at week 16 and maintained at week 48). 
As measure of improvement of enthesitis the MAH had included the change in MASES index (total score 
ranging 0 – 13) at week 16 as not controlled secondary endpoint showing an improvement of -2 versus -
1.41, delta of -0.53 slightly increasing at week 48. Therefore, no significant statistical difference has been 
shown for this domain of the disease.  
Other measures of symptoms and physical function recommended which has been included within 
secondary endpoints not controlled for multiplicity is the change of BASDAI at week 16 (showing an 
improvement of -2.55 at week 16 delta of -1.44). However, this is a widely used measure of disease 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 126/215 
 
 
 
 
activity and its changes with treatment should be assessed as secondary endpoint. Moreover, the 
percentage of patients with clinical response as measured by an improvement of at least a 50% from the 
baseline score in BASDAI is considered useful to judge the clinical benefit of a treatment but was not 
included by the MAH. 
Overall, results from Study A3921119 were supportive of the phase 3 study with regard to different 
endpoints pertaining to disease activity and physical functions, health related outcomes, spinal mobility.  
Indirect comparison with active treatments 
The placebo-controlled trial did not include an active comparator. To indirectly compare the treatment 
effects of tofacitinib 5 mg BID with other treatments for AS, the MAH performed a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials of EMA-approved biological DMARDs, including ASAS20/40 at 
week 12-16, in patients with AS with or without previous experience with biological DMARDs. 
According to the results, ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses for tofacitinib 5 mg BID across Studies 
A3921119 and A3921120, were similar compared with adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, 
golimumab, infliximab, ixekizumab and secukinumab. The treatment effects on ASAS40 were 26% and 
28% in the two tofacitinib trials, while the majority of treatment effects of the other biological DMARDs 
ranged from 17% (adalimumab, COAST V) to 37% (infliximab, ASSERT). The MEASURE 4 trial in 
secukinumab showed lower treatment effects than the other trials including MEASURE 2. MEASURE 1 and 
3 were not included in the meta-analysis, because of the iv loading dose that was used in those trials, 
which is not in the approved posology of secukinumab.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clinically relevant effect as measured by ASAS20/ASA40 has been demonstrated for tofacitinib 5 mg BD 
in the target population of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have responded 
inadequately to conventional therapy.  Most of the secondary endpoints measuring mainly signs and 
symptoms, inflammation and QoL endpoints provide supportive results. For other disease domains such 
as spinal mobility and enthesitis only limited or only a trend in effect was seen. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Tofacitinib Clinical Programmes in RA and PsA 
Tofacitinib has previously been evaluated in other clinical programmes such as RA and PsA.  
The RA and PsA programmes comprise a larger number of patients over a longer duration compared to 
the current AS programme. Safety data from these non-AS indications have been included for 
contextualisation of the safety data observed in the AS clinical programme.  
The RA and PsA databases integrated within each programme enable the following evaluations:  
• 
To compare the incidence rates for AEs of special interest to determine whether there are 
similarities. 
• 
To compare the rates of certain AEs, especially those with long latency periods (e.g., 
malignancies), to determine whether there is an increase following exposures to tofacitinib for longer 
periods than in AS studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021

The integrated datasets from the 23 RA studies and the 3 PsA studies were used to compare key safety 
endpoints to further contextualise the safety profile in AS. Details on the safety populations from the RA 
and PsA studies used for contextualisation are shown in   Table 65.

Known Safety Profile 
Tofacitinib, in the already approved indications, has shown a safety profile mainly characterised by the 
following considerations (from the current SmPC section 4.4):

-  Serious VTE events including pulmonary embolism (PE), some of which were fatal, and deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT), have been observed in patients taking tofacitinib. A dose dependent increased 
risk for VTE was observed in a clinical study with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. 
-  Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or 
other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving tofacitinib. The risk of 
opportunistic infections is higher in Asian geographic regions. 
-  Viral reactivation and cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster) were observed in 
clinical studies with tofacitinib. In patients treated with tofacitinib, the incidence of herpes zoster 
appears to be increased in: Japanese or Korean patients, Patients with an ALC less than 1,000 
cells/mm3, Patients with long standing RA who have previously received two or more biological 
disease- modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), Patients treated with 10 mg twice daily. 
- 
Lymphomas have been observed in patients treated with tofacitinib. Other malignancies were 
observed in clinical studies and the post-marketing setting, including, but not limited to, lung 
cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The effect of tofacitinib 
on the development and course of malignancies is not known. 
-  NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with tofacitinib. 
- 
Events of interstitial lung disease (some of which had a fatal outcome) have been reported in 
patients treated with tofacitinib in RA clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting although the 
role of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition in these events is not known.  
- 
- 
Events of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical trials although the role of JAK 
inhibition in these events is not known. 
Treatment with tofacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation in 
some patients. 
Furthermore, on 18 January 2021 the MAH informed the EMA about an Emerging Safety Issue (ESI) 
notification for tofacitinib pertaining to two signals identified from review of the final study data for the 
co-primary endpoints in Study A3921133, specifically including the increased incidence of adjudicated 
MACE and adjudicated malignancies (excluding NMSC). Interim results of the study have been assessed 
as part of a signal procedure (EPITT ref. No. 19382). Consequently, sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC and correspondent sections of the Package Leaflet were updated to appropriately reflect the 
information. The RMP was also updated with additional risk minimisation measures and a DHPC for 
tofacitinib was also endorsed. The final study report of Study A3921133 is currently under evaluation 
(EMEA/H/C/004212/II/0044) and the assessment will follow.  
Source of Safety Data  
The studies included in the present analysis are: 
• 
1 completed Phase 2, 12-week long randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging 
Study A3921119 in patients with AS. Tofacitinib IR was evaluated at doses of 2, 5 and 10 mg BID. 
• 
1 completed pivotal Study A3921120 in patients with AS. This was a 48-week long phase 3, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled (first 16 weeks) study of the efficacy and safety of 
tofacitinib in patients with active AS. Tofacitinib IR was evaluated at a dose of 5 mg BID. 
Note that for Study A3921120, the treatment duration was 48 weeks which comprised an initial 
placebo-controlled treatment period of 16 weeks duration followed by an open-label treatment period of 
32 weeks duration. All patients, investigators, and the study team remained blinded to the double-blinded 
treatment until Week 48 when the final database was released.

a. 270 patients were randomised but 269 patients received study treatment and were included in the analysis. 
b. Patients switched to open-label treatment at Week 16 visit until Week 48. 
c. 134 patients were randomised to Tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID→Tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID but 133 patients 
received study treatment and were included in the analysis. 
d. 208 patients were randomised, but 207 patients received study treatment and were included in the 
analysis. 
e. 52 patients were randomised to Placebo, but 51 patients received study treatment and were included in the 
analysis. 
The integrated analysis of safety included pooling of Studies A3921119 and A3921120 (Table 67) to 
assess: 
• 
Short-term (0-16 weeks) safety of tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID in comparison to placebo in the 
combined trials (the ‘Placebo-controlled Cohort’; table below).  
• 
Longer-term (0-48 weeks) safety of tofacitinib in the combined trials’ exposure to the study drug 
(the ‘All Tofa Cohort’; next table). The All Tofa Cohort has 2 analysis groups: All Tofa 5 mg BID

Studies Included and Pooling Strategies 
•  A3921119 (0 - 12 Weeks), A3921120 (0 - 16 Weeks) 
•  This cohort includes patients who were randomised and received 
tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID or placebo from the double-blinded 
placebo-controlled periods of the studies. 
•  Analysis groups of the cohort: (1) Tofa 5 mg BID, (2) Placebo. 
•  Comparison: Tofa 5 mg BID versus Placebo. 
•  A3921119 (0 - 12 Weeks), A3921120 (0 – 48 Weeks) 
•  This cohort includes all randomised patients and treated with at least 1 
dose of tofacitinib (2 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg BID) from the tofacitinib-
exposed periods, therefore excluding placebo-exposed period for patients 
randomised to placebo → tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID groupa in Study 
A3921120. 
•  Analysis groups of the cohort: (1) All Tofa 5 mg BID, (2) All Tofa. The 
All Tofa 5 mg BID group differs from All Tofa analysis group because the 
All Tofa 5 mg BID group includes only the patients who received 5 mg 
BID, while the All Tofa analysis group includes additional data from the 
Tofa 2 mg BID and 10 mg BID groups from Study A3921119. 
•  Comparison: None. 
Source: Module 5.3.5.3 SCS iAP Table 3 
a. In Study A3921120, patients randomised to the placebo → tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID group received placebo during the double-
blind period (0 - 16 Weeks) and switched to open-label tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID at Week 16 in a blinded fashion. All patients, 
investigators, and the Pfizer study team remained blinded to the double-blinded treatment until Week 48 when the final database 
was released. 
Safety data come from 2 studies, one Phase 2 (A3921119) and one pivotal Phase 3 (A3921120). The 
Study 119 was double-blind and different tofacitinib doses were tested (2, 5, and 10 mg BID) and 
included a placebo arm, for a duration of 12 weeks. The Study 120 (phase 3) was double-blind placebo-
controlled for the first 16 weeks and after that continued as open-label with all subjects receiving 
tofacitinib, until 32 weeks (total 48 weeks). 
Patient exposure 
The number of patients included in the Placebo-controlled Cohort and the All Tofa Cohort, including those 
exposed to tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID, are presented in Table 68.

In the Placebo-controlled Cohort, the mean age was 41.9 years in the Tofa 5 mg BID group and 40.5 
years in the Placebo group, <5% (n=13 in All Tofa) of patients were ≥65, there was a predominance of 
males (83.8% in the Tofa 5 mg BID group and 74.9% in the Placebo group) and the majority of patients 
were White (81.1% in the Tofa 5 mg BID group and 79.7% in the Placebo group). Geographic distribution 
in the Tofa 5 mg BID group was as follows: North America (14.6%), European Union (43.8%), Asia 
(17.3%) and Rest of World (24.3%). 
Prior Medication Use 
Prior medication use in the AS programme is summarised below: 
• 
• 
• 
96.5% of patients had an inadequate response to 2 or more NSAIDs  
83.3% of the patients were bDMARD naïve  
11.0% of patients had prior use of oral CS  
Concomitant Medication Use 
Concomitant medications to treat AS on Day 1 are summarised below: 
• 
27.7% of patients were on csDMARDs on Day 1. There were more patients in the Placebo arm 
(31.0%) on concomitant csDMARDs than the Tofa 5 mg BID arm (24.3%). 
83.3% of patients were on concomitant NSAIDs and 9.7% were on other pain management/analgesics. 
• 
8.1% of patients were on CS on Day 1. There were more patients in the Tofa 5 mg BID arm 
(9.7%) on concomitant CS than the Placebo arm (6.4%). 
For the All Tofa Cohort, demographic and baseline characteristics are presented in   Table 69. The 
characteristics in the All Tofa 5 mg BID were comparable to those in the Tofa 5 mg BID group in the 
Placebo-controlled Cohort, according to the MAH.

(a) If the same subject in a given treatment has more than one occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the most 
severe occurrence is counted.  
Subjects are counted only once per treatment per event. For the TESS algorithm any missing severities have been imputed as 
severe unless the subject experiences another occurrence of the same event in a given treatment for which severity is recorded. In 
this case, the reported severity is summarized.  
Maximum severity at any dictionary level is calculated after the report subset criteria is applied.  
TEAE in A3921119 is defined as those on-treatment events which are new or worsened in severity relative to the pre-treatment 
period prior to Day 1.  
TEAE in A3921120 is defined as those on-treatment events which start during the effective duration of treatment.  
N: Number of subjects included in the Safety Analysis Set; n (%): Number of subjects with the events (Percentages are based on 
N).  
Included Protocols: A3921119, A3921120 (Final Data). MedDRA v23.0 coding dictionary applied.  
Each SOC row counts all the events. Each SOC or PT row shows AE in >=2% of subjects in any treatment group (Total column).

Table C1.3.1.2.3.2-E is for Pfizer internal use. 
The most frequent TEAEs by SOC in the Placebo-controlled Cohort were as follows:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Infections and infestations (Tofa 5 mg BID: 27.6%, Placebo: 23.0%)  
GI disorders (Tofa 5 mg BID: 13.0%, Placebo: 15.0%) 
Investigations (Tofa 5 mg BID: 11.4%, Placebo: 4.3%)  
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (Tofa 5 mg BID: 8.1%, Placebo: 11.2%) 
TEAE frequencies by PT that were higher (>1% difference between treatment groups) in the Tofa 5 mg 
BID group compared to the Placebo group included:  
• 
Fatigue, influenza, respiratory tract infection viral, upper respiratory tract infection, ALT 
increased, AST increased, protein urine present, and arthritis.  
In contrast, the following PTs were higher (>1% difference between treatment groups) for the Placebo 
group compared to the Tofa 5 mg BID group: 
• 
Abdominal pain upper, arthralgia, spinal pain, and dizziness. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the All Tofa cohort, by SOC and PT (≥2% of patients), are  
documented in Table 74.

(a) If the same subject in a given treatment has more than one occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the most 
severe occurrence is counted.  
Subjects are counted only once per treatment per event. For the TESS algorithm any missing severities have been imputed as 
severe unless the subject experiences another occurrence of the same event in a given treatment for which severity is recorded. In 
this case, the reported severity is summarized.  
Maximum severity at any dictionary level is calculated after the report subset criteria is applied.  
TEAE in A3921119 is defined as those on-treatment events which are new or worsened in severity relative to the pre-treatment 
period prior to Day 1.  
TEAE in A3921120 is defined as those on-treatment events which start during the effective duration of treatment.  
N: Number of subjects included in the Safety Analysis Set; n (%): Number of subjects with the events (Percentages are based on 
N).  
Each SOC row counts all the events. Each SOC or PT row shows AE in >=2% of subjects in any treatment group (Total column).  
Included Protocols: A3921119, A3921120 (Final Data). MedDRA v23.0 coding dictionary applied.

Safety of Tofacitinib in the RA and PsA development programmes 
The safety databases from the RA and PsA programmes provide insight on the incidence rates and range 
of AEs reported with tofacitinib treatment in the AS programme, whilst recognising the differences 
regarding the design of the RA (separate monotherapy and background csDMARD) and PsA (background 
csDMARD only) programmes.

Overall, in the AS placebo-controlled cohort (with exposure up to 16 weeks, thus short-term), the 
proportion of subject with AEs was similar or slightly higher in tofacitinib than in placebo: 101 (54.6%) vs 
92 (49.2%). However, when the AS All Tofa cohort is considered (with longer duration of exposure), a 
higher incidence of AEs is found. In particular, subjects with AEs were 201 (63.6%) in tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID vs 251 (59.8%) in All tofacitinib (for a rough comparison, the number in the short-term placebo arm 
was 92, 49.2%). 
Subjects with dose reduced or temporary discontinuation due to adverse events were 30 (9.5%) in 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID vs 32 (7.6%) in All tofacitinib (for a rough comparison, the number in the short-term 
placebo arm was 6, 3.2%). 
Among the most common AEs, those with more marked difference vs placebo are reported (during the 
16 weeks of the placebo-controlled period): infections and infestations were 114 (36.1%) in tofacitinib 
5mg BID vs 135 (32.1%) in All tofacitinib vs 43 (23.0%) in placebo. Investigations AEs were reported in 
53 (16.8%) in tofacitinib 5 mg BID vs 59 (14.0%) in all tofacitinib cohort vs 8 (4.3%) in the placebo. 
Most of these investigation AE cases were related to increased liver transaminases. The type of observed 
AEs is in line with the safety profile of tofacitinib kwon so far.

In the placebo-controlled cohort (with a limited exposure up to 16 weeks), more AEs considered related 
to the IMP, were moderate in intensity in the tofacitinib arm compared to the placebo (8/185, 4% vs 
3/187, 1%). 
Due to the limited number of patients studied (185 in tofacitinib 5mg BID) and the short duration of the 
placebo-controlled period (up to 16 weeks), it is very difficult to evaluate the observed difference in the 
incidence of AEs; furthermore, many AEs that are typically associated to tofacitinib treatment (such as 
herpes zoster), are not observed in the placebo-controlled period.  
Acute renal failure was observed in more cases in tofacitinib than in placebo, 5 (2.70%) vs 2 (1.07%). 
Increased creatinine is currently reported at the 4.8 tabular listing of ADRs and it is also observed in this 
submission (see below at lab findings). Even if the absolute numbers are small, the MAH was asked to 
elaborate more on the risk of acute renal failure (e.g. possible unbalanced risk factors, medication use, 
etc). With the exception of 1 participant with an AE coded to as “serum creatinine increased”, all events 
listed under the SMQ of “acute renal failure” were coded as “protein urine present”. In most of the cases 
the severity of the alteration was classified as “trace” or “+1”, only one patient had “+2” as severity of 
the finding and none had “+3” or “+4”. Moreover, all participants with AEs of protein urine present had 
creatinine levels within normal limits (WNL) at all visits. Therefore, it seems that the severity of the AEs 
observed was mild on average. The issues was solved. 
Hepatic AEs (including: Hepatic Steatosis, Transaminase Elevations) were overall observed more 
frequently in tofacitinib than in placebo, 10 (5.40%) vs 2 (1.07%) (manually calculated adding the two 
PTs above) and this is consistent with the known impact of tofacitinib on liver enzymes.  
There was a case of serious infection in the tofacitinib 5mg during the placebo-controlled period 
(meningitis aseptic) not considered as an opportunistic infection (and thus considered not related to the 
immunosuppressant effects of tofacitinib). 
Haematological alterations were few in absolute numbers and difficult to assess. 
In the AS program were not observed cases of: Malignancies, NMSC, CV events of MACE or thrombosis 
(ATE, PE, and DVT), GI Perforation, Rhabdomyolysis. To interpret correctly these data, it must be taken 
into account the small number of patients and the limited exposure. 
When the incidence rate for AEs of special interest in patients treated with tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID in the 
AS development program is compared to those observed in the PsA and RA programs, the incidences in 
the AS are lower, this is most probably due to the low exposure in the AS program compared to the other 
two conditions. The same is observed when the comparison is among the All tofacitinib cohort, that is 
among patients who received any tofacitinib dosage (and not only the 5 mg BID); in this case an 
exception is only observed for herpes zoster incidence that is higher in AS patients, incidence per 100 PY 
(95% CI) 2.68 (1.08, 5.53), compared to PsA, 1.76 (1.23, 2.44), but lower compared to RA, 3.58 (3.34, 
3.84).

The proportion of patients reporting SAEs for the All Tofa 5 mg BID group and the associated incidence

incidence rate of 3.49 (95% CI: 1.51, 6.87) patients with events per 100 PY. 
Severity of SAEs is shown in Table 82

Regarding the SAEs, incidence rate was 5.28/100 PY in the tofacitinib 5mg BID in the placebo-controlled 
cohort, vs 3.56/100 PY of the placebo arm; the total number of cases were (tofacitinib 5 mg vs placebo) 
3 vs 2. In All tofacitinib doses the incidence rate was 3.49/100 PY, that is similar to the placebo arm of 
the controlled cohort (but with different length of exposure); the total number of cases in the All 
tofacitinib cohort were (tofacitinib 5 mg BID vs All tofacitinib doses) 9 vs 10. However, it is important to 
keep in mind the limited number of subjects studied. Since the small numbers, it is difficult to identify the 
most common SAEs, because virtually all the observed SAEs occurred each in a single subject. Most of 
the SAEs were mild in severity in both 5mg and all dosses for tofacitinib during the 48-week period of the 
study. 
In the placebo group a patient experienced “foetal death”. Since “pregnancy” was an exclusion criterion, 
the MAH clarified that the patient’s pregnancy was a result of a contraceptive failure (condom and 
spermicide) but she was negative at the start of the study.  
The MAH provided data of comparison between patients treated with tofacitinib in the AS program vs 
those in the RA/PsA programs for SAEs and AEs of Special Interest. Basically, except for herpes zoster in 
patients taking tofacitinib 5mg BID, all the SAEs and other AEs of special interest were apparently less 
frequent in the AS program compared to the RA and PsA programs. This was most probably due to the 
very low exposure in the AS program (PYR=232.98 for tofacitinib all doses) compared to PsA in which 
exposure was about 10 times higher (2037.97) and RA in which it was 100 times higher (23496.73).  
Laboratory findings 
The pooled safety population has been used to evaluate changes from baseline in laboratory parameters of 
AS patients. For the Placebo-controlled Cohort, data for both A3921119 and A3921120 were pooled through 
Week 16. For the A3921119 study, the last dose of study medication was at the Week 12 visit. The Week 
16 visit was a follow up visit 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication and was also included in the 
pooled safety population datasets. 
Incidence of laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 83, without regard to baseline abnormality for 
the Placebo-controlled Cohort.

Patients who had abnormalities for selected laboratory evaluations of interest for tofacitinib were required 
to  promptly  retest  a  laboratory  parameter  or  discontinue  study  medication  due  to  the  laboratory 
abnormalities. The number of patients who met the criteria for retesting a laboratory parameter of interest, 
or had to discontinue study medication due to laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 84 for the

Hemoglobin 
Tofacitinib  is  associated  with  increased  incidence  of  anaemia.  Therefore,  patient  selection  based  on 
threshold  Hb  values  was  an  exclusion  criteria.  Patients  were  required  to  have  Hb  levels  ≥10  g/dL  at  the 
study enrollment visit to enroll in the AS studies. 
Hb changes over time are presented for the Placebo-controlled Cohort in Figure 31 and All Tofa Cohort in

Neutrophils 
Tofacitinib has been associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia, therefore patient selection 
based on threshold ANC values was an exclusion criteria. The mean (± SE) Change from Baseline in

baseline  to  Week  4  for  the  Tofacitinib  5  mg  IR  BID  group.  Platelet  counts  decreased  around  40,000 
averagely from baseline during the first 4 weeks. Afterwards, the platelet counts increased slightly until 16 
weeks but remained averagely 30,000 under the baseline average count. Platelet change in the placebo 
arm  was  not  considerable  and  remained  almost  unchanged  compared  to  the  baseline.  In  the  placebo-
controlled phase, there were no patients that had to discontinue because of 2 sequential platelet counts 
<75 x 10**9/L.  
The mean platelet counts were lower in the Tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID group compared to the Placebo group 
up to Week 16. The mean and median platelet counts remained within the normal range for all visits.

(103/mm3) – AS Placebo-controlled Cohort 
Platelet counts decreased during the first 4 (Table 85) weeks of tofacitinib treatment significantly (mean 
of approximately -45,000 in tofacitinib 5mg BID group).  After 4th week the platelet counts increased slightly 
but still remained significantly lower than the baseline (mean decrease of –30,000 until week 48).

Liver Parameters 
Tofacitinib has been associated with increases in liver test values compared to placebo. Most of these 
abnormalities have occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily MTX) therapy. 
Changes in AST in the placebo-controlled period are shown in Figure 36.

Renal Function Testing 
Studies in RA patients treated with tofacitinib have demonstrated small mean increases in serum 
creatinine, which remained within the normal reference range (Figure 38). The mean change from 
baseline for creatinine is shown in the following figure for the Placebo-controlled Cohort.

The changes of serum creatine at week 16 from baseline was: Mean (SD) 0.04 (0.100) in tofacitinib 5 mg 
vs 0.02 (0.095) in placebo. 
Lipid Parameters 
Treatment with tofacitinib has been associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters including 
total  cholesterol,  LDL  cholesterol  and  HDL  cholesterol.  Maximum  effects  have  generally  been  observed 
within 6 weeks. 
The mean change from baseline for cholesterol is shown in Figure 39 for the Placebo-controlled Cohort.

ECG 
Table 89 shows the ECG parameters categorization for the placebo-controlled cohort. 
Table 89. Tofacitinib Summary of Clinical Safety (AS) – Categorization of ECG Data 
In the comparison between tofacitinib 5 mg BID and placebo (with exposure up to 16 weeks) there seem 
to be no particular signals of safety issues from laboratory findings, except for a slight higher proportion 
of subjects that had increased liver transaminases in tofacitinib compared to placebo. In particular, 
subjects with AST >3.0x ULN were 4 (2.2%) in tofacitinib vs 1 (0.5%) in placebo; ALT >3.0x ULN were 5 
(2.7%) vs 1 (0.5%). Also Triglycerides (mg/dL) >1.3x ULN were increased in 7 (3.8%) patients taking 
tofacitinib vs 3 (1.6%) in placebo. This confirms the known increase in the liver function tests.  
No reduction in haemoglobin levels was observed in the AS program, despite the tendency of tofacitinib 
to induce anemia. Again, the plausible explanation is the limited exposure. 
During the placebo-controlled period, a slight decrease in the neutrophil count was observed in the 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID compared to placebo. The reduction occurred already after few weeks of treatment. 
At week 16 (last visit of the placebo-controlled period), Neutrophils (10^3/mm^3) were: mean (SD) 4.66 
(1.673) in tofacitinib 5mg vs 4.97 (1.831) in placebo. 
There was a slight reduction in platelets count at week 16 in tofacitinib 5 mg vs placebo, mean (SD)  
(10^3/mm^3): 270.58 (61.094) vs  304.48 (89.657). However, the values remained in the normal range 
for all the visits. 
Lipids were influenced by tofacitinib treatment, in particular a mild increase in total cholesterol, LDL, HDL 
and triglycerides was observed. 
No clinically significant changes were observed in blood pressure during the up to 16 weeks of the 
placebo-controlled period in patients taking tofacitinib, and also at the end of the 48 weeks in the 
uncontrolled period. 
An increase in weight was observed among tofacitinib patients: at week 16 the change from baseline 
was (kg) mean (SD): 1.8 (4.96) in tofacitinib 5mg vs 0.5 (2.93) in placebo. In the All tofacitinib cohort 
the increase was 2.2 (4.59) at 48 weeks in both arms (tofacitinib 5mg and All tofacitinib doses). The MAH 
has specified that the overall magnitude of the weight increase in the AS clinical program was considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 170/215 
 
 
 
 
 
to be mild in severity, with a mean increase of 2.2 kg at Week 48 in the All Tofa Cohort.  Similar 
increases were observed in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) clinical programs.  
The percentage of participants that switched from the <25 kg/m2 category to ≥25 - <35 kg/m2 category 
was 14.3% and from the ≥25 to <35 kg/m2 category to ≥35 kg/m2 category was 4.4% for the tofacitinib 
5 mg BID treatment group at Week 48. 
Since weight increase is already present in the tabular list at the 4.8 of the SmPC, this is considered 
sufficient in relation to the magnitude of observed effect. 
No alterations in the ECG parameters were observed during the placebo-controlled phase.

Concomitant and Prior Medications for AS 
The impact of prior bDMARD medication use and csDMARD use at baseline on safety was assessed in the 
overall pooled safety population. In both Study A3921119 and Study A3921120, patients were prohibited 
from receiving bDMARDs during the study. In A3921119, patients with prior use of bDMARDs were excluded. 
In  Study  A3921120,  patients  with  prior  use  of  bDMARDS  were  permitted  to  be  enrolled;  however, 
approximately 80% were required to be bDMARD naïve. Patients were stratified by prior treatment history: 
(1) bDMARD-naive (approximately 80%) and (2) Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitor-inadequate responder or 
bDMARD use (without inadequate response) (approximately 20%). 
The majority of patients with AS in the clinical programme were naive to bDMARDs, with 81.6% in the All 
Tofa 5 mg BID group in the All Tofa Cohort having no previous experience with bDMARDs. 
The  incidence  and  proportions  and  incidence  rates  for  general  events  and  infections  by  prior  treatment 
history are presented in Table 94.

Concomitant csDMARDs 
The majority (71.8%) of patients in the AS clinical programme were not taking concomitant csDMARDs 
(Day 1). The incidence and proportions and incidence rates for general events and infections by Day 1 
concomitant csDMARD use are presented in Table 95. 
Table 95. Tofacitinib Summary of Clinical Safety (Ankylosing Spondylitis) Incidence Proportions and 
Incidence Rates for General Events and Infections by Day 1 Concomitant csDMARD Use - While on 
Treatment Estimand, AS All Tofa Cohort 
Effects by age are very difficult to estimate since the limited number of subjects >65 years (n=13) vs 
<65 years (n=407) and thus no conclusions can be drawn.  
As to the gender, in almost all the categories for the general events, and also for herpes zoster, female 
patients had higher incidence rates compared to male. However, the cohort was unbalanced since there 
were 594 males and 142 females. Therefore, firm conclusions are difficult to be drawn. 
Regarding the race most patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group were White (n=252) and few were 
Asian (n=63). In general, Asian patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group experienced more AEs, n=49 
(77.78%), IR per 100PY (95% CI): 302.22 (223.58, 399.55) compared to White, n=149 (59.13%), IR 
per 100PY (95% CI): 136.90 (115.80, 160.73), and experienced more Infections, Asian: n=33 (52.38%), 
IR per 100PY (95% CI): 111.78 (76.94, 156.98) vs White: n=78 (30.95%), IR per 100PY (95% CI): 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 178/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
53.80 (42.53, 67.14). A similar trend was observed for the All tofacitinib doses. However, again the 
limited number of Asian patients makes difficult to draw any firm conclusion. 
Some differences were observed in the distribution of AEs by geographical region. However, the number 
of patients for each regions does not allow a fully reliable evaluation. Overall, general events for 
European region were in line, or less frequent, than for the other regions, and data about Asia confirm 
the increased AEs incidence rate for Asian sub-population. 
When analysed by previous treatment, patients were divided in two categories: bDMARD-naive 
(approximately 80%) and TNF inhibitor-inadequate responder or bDMARD use (without inadequate 
response) (approximately 20%). Therefore, the number of subjects with previous bDMARD use was small 
(n=58, all treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID) compared to those bDMARD-naïve (n=362 with all tofacitinib 
doses). Overall, a consistent increase in general events (such as AEs, SAEs, discontinuations, etc) and 
infections was observed in patients with previous treatment with TNFi or bDMARD compared to those 
bDMARD-naïve. AEs were n=42 (72.41%), IR per 100 PY (95% CI): 201.32 (145.09, 272.12) in previous 
treated vs n=156 (60.47%), IR per 100 PY (95% CI): 148.31 (125.95, 173.49) in naïve patients. The 
highest difference was observed for Discontinuation of study treatment, which involved n=13 (22.41%) 
subjects, IR per 100 PY (95% CI):  30.02 (15.98, 51.33) in previous treated, vs n=12 (4.65%), IR per 
100 PY (95% CI): 6.44 (3.33, 11.25) in naïve patients. The number of patients in the previous treated 
group is small and thus any conclusion is difficult, but such results could be expected, since it is 
biologically plausible that patients already exposed to previous treatments develop more AEs when 
subsequently treated with tofacitinib. 
When analysed by concomitant csDMARD therapy, a trend of higher incidence was observed in many 
categories of general events in patients not taking concomitant csDMARD compared to those taking 
csDMARD (TEAEs 64.3% vs 58.4%, SAEs 3.1% vs 1.1%, Discontinuation of study treatment 8.8% vs 
5.6%, Discontinuation due to AEs 4.0% vs 2.3%, All Infections 37.0% vs 30.3%; in tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
of the All tofacitinib odes cohort). Again the number of patients enrolled in the two groups was not high, 
227 vs 89 in the “not taking concomitant csDMARD” vs “taking concomitant csDMARD” respectively, and 
was unbalanced with a very small group of patients taking concomitant csDMARD. Therefore, any 
difference observed is difficult to evaluate. Furthermore, there doesn’t seem to be a biological rationale, 
since the contrary was expected.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug in the Placebo-controlled Cohort, described in the next table,  
were infrequent in both treatment groups (<3%). The proportion of patients reporting discontinuations of 
study drug due to AEs for each treatment group and the associated incidence rates (While on Treatment 
Estimand) are as follows (Table 96): 
• 
Tofa 5 mg BID group: 4 (2.16%) patients representing an incidence rate of 7.04 patients with 
events per 100 PY.  
• 
Placebo group: 4 (2.14%) patients representing an incidence rate of 7.10 patients with events per 
100 PY.

The incidence rate of AEs leading to drug discontinuation was similar between tofacitinib 5mg BID and 
placebo, during the placebo-controlled periods (which was up to 16 weeks): 7.04/100 PY in tofacitinib vs 
7.10/100 PY in placebo. The number of subjects with any AE leading to discontinuation was 4 (2.2%) in 
tofacitinib 5mg BID vs 4 (2.1%) in placebo (placebo-controlled cohort) and there was no single AE that 
was more common than others (due to the limited exposure). In the tofacitinib 5mg BID of the All tofa 
cohort (up to 48 weeks), the incidence rate was 4.77/100 PY. In this cohort, the number of subjects with 
any AE leading to discontinuation was 11 (3.5%) in the tofacitinib 5mg BID and 12 (2.9%) in All 
tofacitinib.  
Post marketing experience 
In the EU, Xeljanz was granted a marketing authorisation on 21 March 2017, for the treatment of RA. In 
June 2018, it was approved for treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and in July 2018, it was also 
approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC).  
The MAH monitors post-marketing data across the different approved indications (RA, PsA, and UC), 
which reflects the safety profile of tofacitinib since marketing approval. The updated post-marketing 
surveillance data and US Corrona RA Registry Study A3921205 subset analysis, provided in this SCS, 
supplements the clinical data and provides evidence of the long-term safety of tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID in 
the real-world setting. An additional 4 EU based ongoing registries (ARTIS, RABBIT, BIOBADASER and 
BSRBR) in RA patients are monitored and provide further evidence of the long-term safety of tofacitinib 5 
mg IR BID in the real-world setting.

The MAH has provided a literature search of published clinical trials and observational studies to identify 
relevant safety data relating to AEs of special interest in patients treated with biologic DMARDs for AS. 
Incidence rates from external published clinical trials and observational studies were compared to rates 
from the tofacitinib AS programme. 
Post-authorisation study A3921133 
Post-authorisation study A3921133 has been designed to evaluate the safety of tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID compared to a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (etanercept or adalimumab) in 
patients with RA. The available data shows that tofacitinib increases the risk of venous thromboembolism 
(DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE)) in patients with RA and PsA, especially in patients treated with 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and patients with risk factors for venous thromboembolism, as well as risk factors 
for cardiovascular events. On 12 February 2019 the MAH informed EMA that an increased risk of PE and 
overall mortality had been reported in Study A3921133. In this clinical trial, the overall incidence of PE 
was 5.96-fold higher in tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm of the study compared with the TNF inhibitor 
arm, and approximately 3-fold higher than tofacitinib in other studies across the tofacitinib development 
programme. 
On 12 February 2019, the MAH informed EMA that an increased risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) and 
overall mortality had been reported in Study A3921133. In this clinical trial, the overall incidence of PE 
was 5.96-fold higher in tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily arm of the study compared with the TNF inhibitor 
arm, and approximately 3-fold higher than tofacitinib in other studies across the tofacitinib development 
programme. The data safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommended to modify Study A3921133 to 
discontinue treatment with tofacitinib 10 mg BID. Of note, the FDA subjected the continuation of the trial 
to the condition that subjects assigned to the 10 mg BID dose were switched to the lower 5 mg BID dose. 
Post-Marketing Surveillance Reports 
The RMP (Module 5.3.6 RMP Report) includes the current post-marketing data (data cut off 05 Nov 2019). 
Information from the post-marketing setting is also included in the PSUR submitted to the EMEA at 1-year 
intervals (Module 5.3.6 November 2020 PSUR). Findings from post-marketing data have been consistent 
with the safety profile for tofacitinib. 
US Corrona RA Registry Study A3921205 Safety Data 
The US Corrona RA Registry Study A3921205, a non-interventional post-authorisation safety study 
(PASS), was completed in March 2020 using a 31 Jan 2019 data cut. The aim was to describe the rates of 
safety events in tofacitinib initiators compared with bDMARD initiators in real-world clinical use using data 
from the Corrona RA registry. This study of the safety of tofacitinib in exposed RA patients was based on 
data collected within the US Corrona RA Registry. The report of Corrona RA registry has not been found in 
the dossier.  
Safety from the ARTIS real-world dataset 
The ARTIS register study (A3921391) comprised a cohort of 10,603 Swedish patients who were 
comparable to patients in the Phase 3 AS clinical trial programme (A3921120). The crude incidence rates 
for safety events in the ARTIS database for AS patients overall and for all bDMARD initiators (bDMARD 
experienced or bDMARD naïve as of the index date 01 Jul 2006) are presented in Table 98.

Incidence rates for all events, except hospitalized HZ and ILD, were higher among bDMARD-naïve 
compared with the bDMARD-experienced group. 
Safety “Trial-Like Subcohort” from the US Truven MarketScan Analysis 
The Truven MarketScan study consisted of 2 patient cohorts. Cohort A comprised adults (≥18 years of 
age) with active AS within the United States Truven MarketScan database between 01 Jan 2010 and 31 
Dec 2017. Cohort B was a subset of Cohort A, but more closely reflected patients within Study A3921120 
via the application of trial-like exclusion criteria. A total of 5,196 AS patients were identified with 6,506 
eligible biologic treatment episodes in Cohort A; 2,253 patients with 2,662 treatment episodes included in 
the Cohort B analysis. AEs of special interest in "Trial-like” Sub-Cohort (Cohort B) is presented in tables 
99, 100, 101, 102 and 103, 104.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Known Safety Profile Tofacitinib, in the already approved indications, has shown a safety profile mainly 
characterised by the following: serious venous thromboembolism (VTE) events including pulmonary 
embolism (PE), some of which fatal, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT); serious and sometimes fatal 
infections; viral reactivation and cases of herpes virus reactivation; lymphomas have been observed; 
non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) have been reported; gastrointestinal perforation.  
Moreover, on 18 January 2021 the MAH informed the EMA about an Emerging Safety Issue (ESI) 
notification for tofacitinib pertaining to two signals identified from review of the final study data for co-
primary endpoints in Study A3921133, specifically including the increased incidence of adjudicated MACE 
and adjudicated malignancies (excluding NMSC). Interim results of the study have been assessed as 
part of a signal procedure (EPITT ref. No. 19382). Consequently, sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
and correspondent sections of the Package Leaflet were updated to appropriately reflect the information. 
The RMP was also updated with additional risk minimisation measures and a DHPC for tofacitinib was also 
endorsed. The final study report of Study A3921133 is currently under evaluation 
(EMEA/H/C/004212/II/0044) and the assessment will follow. 
Source of data Two studies are included in the present analysis: 1) one completed Phase 2, 12-week 
long randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Study A3921119 in patients with AS. 
Tofacitinib IR was evaluated at doses of 2, 5 and 10 mg BID; 2) one completed pivotal Study A3921120, 
48-week long phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled (first 16 weeks) study of the efficacy 
and safety of tofacitinib in patients with active AS. Tofacitinib IR was evaluated at a dose of 5 mg BID. 
The integrated analysis of safety included pooling of the two studies to assess: 1) short-term (0-16 
weeks) safety of tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID in comparison to placebo in the combined trials (the ‘Placebo-
controlled Cohort’); 2) longer-term (0-48 weeks) safety of tofacitinib in the combined trials’ (the ‘All Tofa 
Cohort’). The All Tofa Cohort has 2 analysis groups: All Tofa 5 mg BID (tofacitinib 5 mg IR BID in the 
combined trials) and All Tofa (tofacitinib 2 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg BID in the combined trials). 
Exposure 253 patients were exposed to tofacitinib 5 mg BID (the intended dosage for the current 
application) for at least 6 months (patients-year (PY)=194), and 108 patients for at least 1 year 
(PY=100). There were 108 patients with AS with an exposure longer than 12 months.  The number of 
patients exposed to a long-term treatment (e.g., 12 months) is limited, considering that the sought 
indication is a chronic disease requiring long-term therapy and also considering some safety concerns of 
the drug emerging with long term use. In accordance with EMA guidelines, which consider appropriate to 
have data from periods longer than 12-month in this specific context, the MAH was asked to update the 
safety data and analysis for those subjects who experienced an exposure longer than 1 year. However, 
the MAH responded that during the AS program, no additional risks specific to AS emerged, and that the 
overall safety profile, including long-term safety, of the AS population is consistent with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Since RA and PsA are also chronic diseases requiring long-term 
therapy, the MAH, thus, considers the long-term safety data (≥1 year) for tofacitinib gathered from RA 
and PsA patients to be applicable to the AS population. Therefore, the MAH does not foresee to conduct a 
specific study to gather long-term data in the AS population. This is acceptable. 
Adverse events Overall, in the AS placebo-controlled cohort (short-term exposure, up to 16 weeks), the 
proportion of subject with AEs was slightly higher in tofacitinib than in placebo (54.6% vs 49.2%).  
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the tofacitinib arm of the Placebo-controlled Cohort were within 
the Infections and infestations (27.6%), Gastrointestinal disorders (13%), Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders SOCs (8.1%), and ALT/AST increase (3.2% and 2.2%). This was slightly lower in the 
placebo arm (23%, 15%, 11.2%, 0.5% and 0%, respectively). Similarly, the most frequently reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 186/215 
 
 
 
 
TEAEs in the All Tofa Cohort were within the Infections and infestations (32.1%), Gastrointestinal 
disorders (16.2%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (10.5%) SOCs.  
However, when the All Tofa cohort is considered, a higher incidence of AEs is found (as expected since 
the longer exposure): subjects with AEs were 63.6% in tofacitinib 5 mg BID. 
Due to the limited number of patients studied in the placebo-controlled trial (185 in tofacitinib 5mg BID) 
and the short duration of the placebo-controlled period (up to 16 weeks), it is very difficult to evaluate 
the observed difference in the incidence of AEs; furthermore, many AEs that are typically associated to 
tofacitinib treatment (such as herpes zoster), are not observed in the placebo-controlled period.  
For the following AEs Hazard Ratios are higher in tofacitinib arm versus placebo: acute renal failure 
(HR=2.57), hypertension (2.05), weight increase (2), hyperlipidaemia (2.01) and transaminase 
elevations (4.03). Hypertension, weight increase, hyperlipidaemia and transaminase elevation are 
mentioned in SmPC 4.8. Seven cases of HZ (all non-serious) were reported in the AS clinical programme. 
The incidence rate per 100 PY was higher than in the PsA dataset and comparable to RA dataset (2.7, 1.7 
and 3.6, respectively). Herpes zoster is already reported as a common AE in table 6 of current 4.8.  
Acute renal failure was observed in more cases in tofacitinib than in placebo, 5 (2.70%) vs 2 (1.07%). It 
was 3.8% in All Tofa cohort, all treated with tofacitinib 5mg BID. Almost all the events listed under the 
SMQ of “acute renal failure” were coded as “protein urine present”. In most of the cases the severity of 
the alteration was classified as “trace” or “+1”, only one patient had “+2” as severity of the finding and 
none had “+3” or “+4”. Moreover, all participants with AEs of “protein urine present” had creatinine levels 
within normal limits at all visits. Therefore, it seems that the severity of the AEs observed was mild on 
average. The risk of creatinine increase is already recognized at the 4.8 tabular listing of ADR in the 
SmPC. 
Hepatic AEs (including: Hepatic Steatosis, Transaminase Elevations) were overall observed more 
frequently in tofacitinib than in placebo (5.40% vs 1.07%) and this is consistent with the known impact of 
tofacitinib on liver safety.  
In the AS program were not observed cases of: Malignancies, NMSC, CV events of MACE or thrombosis 
(ATE, PE, and DVT), GI Perforation, Rhabdomyolysis. To interpret correctly these data, it must be taken 
into account the small number of patients and the limited exposure. 
When the incidence rate for AEs of special interest in patients treated with tofacitinib in the AS 
development program is compared to those observed in the PsA and RA programs, the incidences in the 
AS are lower, this is almost certainly due to the low exposure in the AS program compared to the other 
two conditions. An exception is observed for herpes zoster incidence that is higher in AS patients 
(2.68/100 PY) compared to PsA (1.76/100 PY) but lower compared to RA (3.58/100 PY). 
When compared to the RA/PsA programs, except for herpes zoster in patients taking tofacitinib 5mg BID, 
all the SAEs were apparently less frequent in the AS program. This was most probably due to the very 
low exposure in the AS program (PYR=232.98 for tofacitinib all doses) compared to PsA in which 
exposure was about 10 times higher (2037.97) and RA in which it was 100 times higher (23496.73).  
SAEs and deaths No deaths were reported in the AS clinical program. Incidence rate of SAEs (per 100 
PY) was slightly higher in tofacitinib 5 mg than in placebo (5.28 vs 3.56) but the total number of cases 
was small (3 vs 2). In All tofacitinib doses the incidence rate was 3.49, that is similar to the placebo arm 
of the controlled cohort. There were 13 SAEs in 10 patients occurred under all tofa cohort (n=1 for each 
PT): Hypoacusis, Iridocyclitis, Abdominal adhesions, Condition aggravated, Hyperplastic cholecystopathy, 
Meningitis aseptic, Rib fracture, Tendon injury, Spinal osteoarthritis, Migraine, Ureterolithiasis, 
Pneumothorax and Subcutaneous emphysema. The rate of SAEs is comparable in the tofacitinib arm as 
compared to placebo.Since the small numbers, it is difficult to identify the most common SAEs, because 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 187/215 
 
 
 
 
virtually all the observed SAEs occurred each in a single subject. Most of the SAEs were mild in severity 
and many were managed by drug withdrawal. 
Laboratory findings  
Inclusion criteria for AS trials only allowed patients with a platelet count ≥100,000 platelets/mm3. Platelet 
counts showed a mean decrease of almost –30,000/mm3 after 48 weeks in the All Tofa cohort. In the AS 
clinical program, a decrease in mean platelet counts was observed from baseline to Week 4 in the 
Tofacitinib 5 mg IR twice a day (BID) group: platelets decreased of about 30.000/mm3 at Week 16, 
wehereas in the placebo group there was no substantial change compared to baseline (up to week 16). 
Furthermore, the reduction observed in the tofacitinib group persisted with the same magnitude (i.e., at 
least 30.000/mm3) through week 48. From the data provided, a reduction in platelet count is also 
observed in RA and PsA patients, and the magnitude of this reduction is somehow comparable to what 
observed in SA. The lowest platelet count for an individual participant was 109,000 cells/mm3 and was 
mild in severity No participants had platelet counts meeting the criteria of moderate or severe laboratory 
abnormalities. Therefore, the data presented by the MAH indicates that the risk of platelet reduction is 
not specific to AS but it seems to be present in the other indications, too. The SmPC section 4.8. has 
been modified to reflect the fact that patients enrolled in the clinical program were required to have a 
platelet count >100,000 /mm3.  
AST, ALT and bilirubin increased in tofacitinib arm but were steady in the placebo arm (AST >3.0x ULN: 
2.2% vs 0.5%; ALT >3.0x ULN: 2.7% vs 0.5%). This is mentioned adequately in 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
proposed SmPC. 
Subjects with increased Triglycerides were also higher in tofacitinib than in placebo (>1.3x ULN: 3.8% vs 
1.6%). In general, the whole lipid profile was influenced by tofacitinib, with mild increase in total 
cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides; these AEs are already acknowledged in the SmPC.  
Other laboratory result changes were comparable between tofacitinib arm and placebo arm in placebo-
controlled cohort.   
Vital signs No clinically significant changes were observed in blood pressure during the 16 weeks of the 
placebo-controlled period in patients taking tofacitinib or at the end of the 48 weeks (in the uncontrolled 
period); no alterations in the ECG parameters were found. 
An increase in weight was observed among tofacitinib patients compared to placebo groups at 16 weeks 
(mean change from baseline: 1.8 vs 0.5 kg). In the All tofacitinib cohort at 48 weeks the increase was 
2.2 kg (tofacitinib users). The percentage of participants that switched from the <25 kg/m2 category to 
≥25 - <35 kg/m2 category was 14.3% and from the ≥25 - <35 kg/m2 category to ≥35 kg/m2 category 
was 4.4% for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID treatment group at Week 48. Weight increase is already present in 
the AEs tabular list at the 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Special populations Effects by age are very difficult to estimate since the limited number of subjects 
(exposed to all tofacitinib doses) >65 years (n=13) vs <65 years (n=407) and thus no conclusions can be 
drawn). Data from the RA indication has shown a higher risk for serious infections in patients older than 
65 years. This is reflected in the SmPC (4.4). 
As to the gender, in almost all the categories of general events (and also for herpes zoster) female 
patients had higher incidence rates compared to male. However, the cohort was unbalanced since there 
were 594 males and 142 females.  
Regarding the race most patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group were White (n=252) and few were 
Asian (n=63). In general, more Asian patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group experienced AEs (77.78%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 188/215 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to White (59.13%); more Asian subjects experienced Infections (52.38%) than White patients 
(30.95%). This is reflected in the SmPC, section 4.4. 
Limited data regarding treatment with tofacitinib during pregnancy is available. No additional concerns 
are raised from AS pivotal trials. 
Concomitant medication 
Recommendations regarding DDIs are extrapolated from RA and PsA studies. No additional DDI studies 
have been conducted for the AS indication. This is considered acceptable, because, considering the 
underlying pathophysiology of RA, PsA and AS (all auto-immune diseases) and treatment options, no 
additional interaction issues are expected for the AS indication. 
Most patients (80%) were bDMARD-naïve, and only few (20%, n=58) had used TNF inhibitor or bDMARD 
(20%, n=58) prior to the start of the study. Overall, a consistent increase in general events (such as AEs, 
SAEs, discontinuations, etc) and infections was observed in patients with previous treatment with TNFi or 
bDMARD compared to those bDMARD-naïve: AEs were 72.41% vs 60.47%. The highest difference was 
observed for “Discontinuation of study treatment”, which involved 22.41% vs 4.65% of patients. The 
number of patients in the “previously treated” group is small and thus any conclusion is difficult, but such 
results could be expected, since it is biologically plausible that patients already exposed to previous 
treatments develop more AEs when subsequently treated with tofacitinib. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
The rate of discontinuation due to AEs was low (n=11, 3.48%) in tofacitinib 5mg BID arms. The most 
frequent SOC reported for discontinuation belongs to infections (n=3, 0.9%). Infection is a known risk of 
JAK-inhibitors and is adequately discussed in proposed text of tofacitinib SmPC section 4.4. No new 
concerns are raised due to discontinuation after infection. 
Post-marketing experience 
US Corrona RA Registry Study A3921205 report has not been provided in the submitted dossier. 
However, the results of this study are assessed separately by PRAC (EMEA/H/C/004214/II/0023). Indirect 
comparison between the ARTIS register safety results and the All Tofa AS cohort shows a higher incidence 
rate for HZ (0 vs 2.8, respectively) in treatment with tofacitinib. The weighted incidence rate for HZ is 
also higher in All Tofa AS cohort compared to this rate in the Truven analysis (2.8 and 0.74, respectively). 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the risk of HZ is higher if patients with AS would be treated with 
tofacitinib compared to bDMARDs or general AS population. This is reflected in SmPC, 4.4 and 4.8 (see 
assessor's discussion on “adverse events of special interest”). 
A higher incidence of venous thromboembolism has been observed in post-marketing RA study A3921133 
compared to AS pivotal trials. Considering short follow up in AS pivotal trials, VTE events remain a 
concern for AS indication. This is reflected adequately in the RMP. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, patient’s exposure in the sought indication is limited. However, from the data available do 
not emerge new important signals of safety, and tofacitinib is already used in similar conditions (RA and 
PsA). The MAH considers that the safety profile of tofacitinib in the intended population can be 
extrapolated from the long-term safety data available for the RA and PsA population and does not plan to 
conduct any other clinical trial to gather these data from the AS population. This is acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
AS is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease primarily affecting the sacroiliac joints and spine and is 
part of the family of related SpA disorders, which also includes PsA. AS or radiographic axial SpA is 
defined by the presence of definitive radiographic sacroiliitis based upon 1984 Modified New York 
classification criteria. AS causes chronic inflammation at the insertion of ligaments and tendons in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 206/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
axial skeleton (entheses) and may progress from inflammation in the sacroiliac joints to sacroiliac and 
spine ankylosis over time. AS is also associated with peripheral arthritis, and enthesitis, and extra-
articular manifestations such as anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and IBD. Osteoporosis is a common AS 
comorbidity. AS is often present for many years before it is diagnosed and typically presents in people 
between 20 and 40 years of age, with a higher prevalence in males, leading to back pain, stiffness, 
fatigue, progressive disability and adverse effects on health.  
Overall, the pathogenesis of AS is not well characterised but seems to include both genetic and 
environmental components, which combine to elicit a chronic inflammatory response involving the innate 
and adaptive immune systems. A genetic link was noted. 90 - 95% of white Western European people 
with AS are positive for the HLA-B27 allele, and risk increases with HLA-B27-positive relatives. -related 
quality of life. Confirmation that TNFaplha (secreted by Th1 and T CD8+ cells) and IL-17 (secreted by 
Th17 and T CD8+ cells) contribute to the pathogenesis of AS has been provided by the efficacy of 
interventions such as TNFi and anti-IL-17 mAb. These biologic therapies directly inhibit the effect of 1 
cytokine pathway. Tofacitinib, a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, interferes directly (eg, IL-23) or indirectly 
(eg, TNFalpha, IL-17) with the signalling of multiple AS-associated cytokines. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Based on the current evidence and the considerations of ASAS and EULAR, NSAIDs and TNFi remain the 
primary classes of medications for the treatment of axial SpA (including AS). Sulfasalazine is considered 
only for the treatment of peripheral arthritis. IL-17i are recommended for patients with active disease in 
whom TNFi are contraindicated, and in primary nonresponders to TNFi. The use of IL-17i should be 
avoided in patients with active IBD, as TNFi monoclonal antibodies are better options. Moreover, recently, 
also another JAK inhibitor has been authorized in EU for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in 
adult patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. 
Treatments are available to control and delay the progression of symptoms of AS. However, additional 
therapy options are still needed as up to 50% of patients with AS continue to have active disease despite 
treatment with NSAIDsor biological agents. 
The use of NSAIDs is limited by gastrointestinal and other adverse events. Other effective agents for the 
treatment of active AS are bDMARDs, which require parenteral administration and may be limited by loss 
of efficacy, often due to immunogenicity.  
As a number of genes and cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AS, it is likely that the 
etiology of AS is complex and has a plethora of underlying contributory factors. This implies that 
additional treatment options with mechanisms of action distinct from those currently available, are 
needed as options for different AS patients.  
In summary, despite the advances that have been made in the last decade in the treatment of AS, a 
significant number of patients with AS still have active disease and remain refractory to currently 
available pharmacotherapies. Unmet medical need therefore remains for a new effective oral DMARD with 
a new MOA that provides a favourable benefit-risk profile and broadens the treatment options for adult 
patients with AS to achieve and sustain clinical benefit. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
With this submission, the MAH seeks a new indication for Tofacitinib for the treatment of adult patients 
with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. The 
recommended dose of tofacitinib is 5 mg administered twice daily.

i) supportive data from Study A3921119 a phase 2, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled dose ranging, parallel group efficacy and safety study designed to characterise the dose 
response of tofacitinib 2 mg BID, 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID in patients with active AS who had 
experienced an inadequate response to NSAIDs and were naïve to previous bDMARDs;  
ii) confirmatory evidence from one pivotal study A3921120, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel group comparing tofacitinib 5mg dosed twice daily to placebo in subjects with 
active AS, who had experienced an inadequate response to NSAIDs (NSAID-IR) and were additionally 
either naïve to previous bDMARDs, or TNFi-IR or experienced to previous bDMARDs but without 
inadequate response (bDMARD Use [Non-IR]). The study design included a 16-week double-blind 
treatment period, a 32-week open-label treatment period (all subjects were assigned to open-label 
tofacitinib 5 mg BID to Week 48) and a 28-day follow-up period (duration of participation for eligible 
subjects was approximately 56 weeks). 
The study included subjects with active AS defined as: Modified New York Criteria for Ankylosing 
Spondylitis (1984), BASDAI score of ≥4 and back pain score (BASDAI Question 2) of ≥4 at both 
screening and baseline and that have had an inadequate response to at least 2 different NSAIDs. 
Additionally, bDMARD naïve, TNFi-IR, or bDMARD (non-IR) exposed were enrolled in this study. The 
proportion of bDMARD-naïve and TNFi-IR or bDMARD use (non-IR i.e., discontinued the bDMARD due to 
other reasons than lack of efficacy or intolerance) was of approximately 80%/20%. 
Randomization was stratified by prior treatment history: (1) bDMARD-naive and (2) TNFi-IR or bDMARD 
use (non-IR).  
Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate for selecting an active AS population and also for 
taking into account the safety profile of the drug. Moreover, criteria for defining previous or concomitant 
allowed, or prohibited therapies and stable doses are considered acceptable.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Tofacitinib dose selected for the phase 3 pivotal A3921120 study comes from the phase 2 study.  
Primary endpoint: a statistically significant higher proportion of patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group 
reached ASAS20 at week 16 in comparison to the placebo group with a treatment difference of 27.08 
(95% CI: 15.89, 38.28), which is in line with the 20% difference expected in the sample size calculation. 
Moreover, the primary analysis is supported by results from all the pre-specified supportive analyses. 
The key secondary endpoint ASAS40 was also met from a statistical perspective with a higher response 
rate of subjects in tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (40.6%) compared to placebo group (12.5%) at week 16. 
The effect size of ASAS40 being very similar to that observed for ASAS20 and of clinical relevance. 
Consistent results are shown by subgroup analyses. For both ASAS20 and ASAS40 a better response rate 
between study drug and placebo is reported in bDMARDs naïve compared to TNF-IR subjects or bDMARD 
[Non-IR].  
The individual components of the ASAS responses (type I controlled) and ASAS 5/6 (not controlled) 
results were consistent with those of the primary and key secondary endpoint. 
Numerous secondary endpoints controlled for multiplicity have been selected for assessing tofacitinib 
efficacy on different disease domains and this is supported, however limitations are foreseen. 
Results from primary and key secondary endpoint were supported by an important secondary (type I 
controlled) endpoint ASDAS (CRP) which is a validated and accepted method to assess disease activity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 208/215 
 
 
 
 
 
and physical function considered a very important disease activity. The LS mean change from baseline in 
ASDAS(CRP) showed a statistically significant decrease for tofacitinib 5 mg BID compared to placebo at 
Week 16 (-1.36 in the tofa arm and -0.39 in the PLB arm at week 16, delta of -0-98) showing a clinically 
relevant difference. At week 48 improvement of ASDAS(CRP) from baseline is still seen.   
Other endpoint has been provided as secondary but not controlled for type I error supporting tofacitinib 
effect across important clinical measures i.e.: ASDAS clinically important improvement (61.3 versus 19.1 
delta 42.3), ASDAS major improvement (30 versus 4.6 delta 25.3), ASDAS inactive disease (6.7 versus 0 
delta 6.7) at week 16; a greater response in the Tofa arm which is maintained at week 48 and with an 
effect size of clinical significance for endpoints measuring improvement. Measure of partial remission was 
also supportive [i.e., ASDAS partial remission: a value of =2 (on a 0 to 10 scale) present in each domain, 
15 versus 3, p 0˂0.001]  
Supportive results were obtained from different Quality of Life endpoints (i.e., ASQoL).  
Measures of spinal mobility, i.e., Linear BASMI (BASMI lin) composite score change at week 16, is a 
relevant efficacy parameter in axial SpA. Results were not robust as those evaluating tofacitinib efficacy 
on sign and symptoms/inflammation of the disease showing a change at week 16 (of -0.63 versus -0.11 
for Tofa and PLB, respectively; similar change (-0.6-0.7) at week 48) statistically significant but not 
clinically relevant.  
Results from Study A3921119 were supportive of the phase 3 study with regard to different endpoints 
mainly pertaining to disease activity and physical functions, health related outcomes. 
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials of EMA-approved 
biological DMARDs, including ASAS20/40 at week 12-16, in patients with AS with or without previous 
experience with biological DMARDs: ASAS40 responses for tofacitinib 5 mg BID across Studies A3921119 
and A3921120, were similar compared with adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, 
infliximab, ixekizumab and secukinumab. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Dose selection comes from the phase 2 study A3921119 (2 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg doses) in order to derive 
the optimal dose for the phase 3 study A3921120. The relationship between tofacitinib exposure (Cavg) 
and clinical response was not adequately captured by the E-R model. The MAH clarified that the ASAS20 
and ASAS40 response rates shown in the VPC plots as “observed” are observed proportions for each 
stratified group.  
Although the design of the phase 3 pivotal Study A3921120 could be acceptable, the lack of an active 
comparator arm hampers assessing the relative B/R balance. As an alternative, the Applicant has 
performed a meta-analysis of approved treatments and included the results of the tofacitinib trials (dose-
finding and pivotal study) as supportive data. Accordingly, the treatment effects of tofacitinib 5 mg BID 
versus placebo were within the range of EMA approved treatments, which indirectly supports the clinical 
relevance of treatment effects. Moreover, no information was provided on evaluation of dose 
reduction/stop and/or increased dose interval for subjects obtaining resolution of inflammation to avoid 
unnecessary toxicity. 
The choice of the primary endpoint (ASAS20 response at week 16) is not in line with the current EMA 
Guideline indicating that ASAS40 response is preferred primary endpoint since is more stringent. 
However, the clinical development program plans for the treatment of AS generally reflects the CHMP 
Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Axial Spondyloarthritis 
(EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 209/215 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg BID was maintained up to week 48 in the patients on tofacitinib, while patients 
switching from placebo to tofacitinib at week 16 ‘catched up’ and approached the effect of the group 
already on tofacitinib from baseline. It is remarkable that the group originally on placebo did not 
completely reach the effect of the group remaining on tofacitinib in ASAS response and secondary 
outcomes. However, as this is a randomised trial, as baseline variables were on average similar between 
the two treatment groups, and attrition was low, it is not expected that this observation can be 
meaningfully explained (not pursued). It also is possible that the open-label phase may have contributed 
to the observation of an increase in efficacy from week 16 to week 48, which however cannot be fully 
evaluated due to a lack of blinding and lack of comparator (not pursued). 
In the subgroup of AS patients with a body weight >100 kg, the estimate of the treatment effect in 
ASAS40 was -13% in favour of placebo. This was not seen in the subgroup analysis of body weight and 
ASAS20, and bodyweight does not appear to influence exposure up to 140 kg (SmPC section 5.2). 
According to the MAH the trend of ASAS40 at Week 16 in the Study A3921120 participants with a body 
weight >100 kg could be explained by the small sample size. Moreover, no major differences in tofacitinib 
exposure over the range of body weights studied were reported and no clinically significant decrease in 
efficacy of tofacitinib has been observed in >100 kg RA patients. Therefore, all together these 
observations do not allow to draw firm conclusion on a lower efficacy in patients with >100 kg body 
weight. 
Although consistent results were shown by subgroup analyses for both ASAS20 and ASAS40 response 
rates, these were higher in the subgroups of subjects identified by very high disease activity or in those 
with higher baseline hsCRP (>2.87 mg/L) suggesting that tofacitinib could perform better in this target 
population however numbers are limited.  
A minority of patients had extra-articular manifestations at baseline to perform a subgroup analysis. In 
view of the potential differences in response in this subgroup of subject’s uncertainty remains on it. In 
order to get reassurance on the efficacy of tofacitinib in subjects with peripheral arthritis a separate 
analysis for ASAS20, ASAS40, delta ASDAS(CRP) has been required for this subgroup. 
Among secondary endpoint, no endpoint that could monitor structural changes, has been included thus no 
data could be derived on this disease domain. 
Measures of low disease activity or partial remission were also supportive of a better effect of tofacitinib 
but were assessed only as part of secondary not controlled endpoints and showed very/limited effect size 
when inactive disease/partial remission was the goal therefore these could not be regarded as conclusive. 
Some questionnaire used to evaluate Quality of Life endpoints is not disease specific and broadly used 
thus results could be seen only as indicative.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of tofacitinib is mainly characterised by different types of AEs, included venous 
thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism, serious infections, cases of non-melanoma skin cancers 
(NMSC), gastrointestinal perforation. Moreover, a recent Emerging Safety Issue (ESI) has been notified 
pertaining cardiovascular events (MACE) and malignancies. 
The proportion of subject with AEs (exposure up to 16 weeks) was slightly higher in tofacitinib than in 
placebo (54.6% vs 49.2%). However, when the All Tofa cohort is considered (longer exposure), a higher 
incidence of AEs is found: subjects with AEs were 63.6% in tofacitinib 5 mg BID.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the tofacitinib arm of the Placebo-controlled Cohort were within 
the Infections and infestations (27.6%), Gastrointestinal disorders (13%), Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders SOCs (8.1%), and ALT/AST increase (3.2% and 2.2%). The most frequently reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 210/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TEAEs in the All Tofa Cohort were within the Infections and infestations (32.1%), Gastrointestinal 
disorders (16.2%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (10.5%) SOCs. 
Among the most common AEs, those more common in tofacitinib 5 mg BID, and with the highest 
differences vs placebo, were “infections and infestations” (36.1% vs 23.0%) and “investigations” AEs 
(16.8% vs 4.3%). Most of these investigation AEs were related to increased liver transaminases.  
Acute renal failure was observed in more patients treated with tofacitinib than with placebo, 5 (2.70%) vs 
2 (1.07%). The small number does not allow drawing any conclusion on this point, but most of the events 
were mild and creatine increase is already listed as AE in the SmPC. 
Hepatic AEs were overall observed more frequently in tofacitinib than in placebo (5.40% vs 1.07%). 
Consistently with this, a higher proportion of subjects had increased liver transaminases in tofacitinib 
compared to placebo (AST >3.0x ULN: 2.2% vs 0.5%; ALT >3.0x ULN: 2.7% vs 0.5%). 
Seven cases of HZ (all non-serious) were reported in the AS clinical programme. The incidence rate per 
100 PY was higher than the incidence rate in the PsA dataset and comparable to the RA dataset (2.7, 1.7 
and 3.6, respectively). 
SAEs (per 100 PY) were higher in tofacitinib 5 mg than in placebo (5.28 vs 3.56) but occurred in a 
minority of subjects. Most SAEs were considered mild in severity, only one subject experienced a severe 
SAE in both tofacitinib 5 mg and tofacitinib all doses’ groups during the 48 weeks period. 
The number of patients needing “dose reduced or temporary discontinuation” was 9.5% vs 3.2% in 
tofacitinib 5   mmmg BID versus placebo. 
The whole lipid profile was influenced by tofacitinib, with mild increase in total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and 
triglycerides; an increase in weight was observed among tofacitinib patients compared to placebo groups 
at 16 weeks (mean change from baseline, kg: 1.8 vs 0.5; in the All tofacitinib cohort at 48 weeks the 
increase was 2.2 kg) both potentially negatively impacting the CV risk of these patients.  
ALT and bilirubin increased in the tofacitinib arm but were steady in the placebo arm.  
Incidence rates for TEAEs, discontinuation of study treatment, discontinuations due to AEs, all infections 
and HZ were generally higher for females compared to males and for patients >= 65 years old compared 
to younger patients. 
A worst safety profile was observed in patients with previous treatment with TNFi or bDMARD compared 
to those bDMARD-naïve: AEs were 72.41% vs 60.47%. The highest difference was observed for 
“Discontinuation of study treatment”, which involved 22.41% vs 4.65% of patients. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The limited exposure in the sought indication could not be sufficient to unveil possible adverse effects that 
could be specific to AS. The placebo-controlled period was limited to 16 weeks; due to this fact, and also 
to the limited number of patients studied, it is very difficult to evaluate the observed difference in the 
incidence of AEs; furthermore, many AEs that are typically associated to tofacitinib treatment (such as 
herpes zoster), are not observed in the placebo-controlled period.  
Inclusion criteria for AS trials only allowed inclusion of patients with a platelet count ≥100,000 
platelets/mm3. It is not clear whether patients with lower platelet counts should safely be allowed to be 
treated with tofacitinib, as a general decrease in platelet count has been observed over time, not only in 
the AS program but also in the other approved indications (RA and PsA). Platelet counts showed a mean 
decrease of almost 30,000/mm3 after 48 weeks in the All Tofa cohort. However, only one patient had an 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 211/215 
 
 
 
 
AE of thromocitopenya (considered as mild). The SmPC has been modified to reflect the fact that patients 
enrolled in the clinical program were required to have a platelet count >100,000 /mm3. 
Although the incidence rate for most AEs of special interest observed in the AS development program is 
lower compared to that observed in the PsA and RA programs and cases of AEs that are known components 
of  the  safety  profile  of  tofacitinib  in  the  other  indications:  Malignancies,  NMSC,  CV  events  of  MACE  or 
thrombosis (ATE, PE, and DVT), GI Perforation, Rhabdomyolysis could noy be excluded that these findings 
should be ascribed to the limited exposure. 
Considering that the sought indication is a chronic disease requiring long-term therapy and also considering 
some  safety  concerns  of  the  drug  emerging  with  long-term  use,  an  update  of  safety  data  and  analyses 
coming from AS subjects exposed more than 1 year was deemed important to provide reassurance on this 
key uncertainty. However, the MAH considers the long-term safety profile of tofacitinib in the AS population 
as similar to what observed for RA and PsA patients and, thus, the MAH does not plan to conduct further 
studies to gather long-term safety data from the AS population. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP.   
Effects by age are very difficult to estimate since the limited number of subjects >65 years (n=13) vs <65 
years (n=407). 
Overall, female patients had higher incidence rates of AEs compared to male, but the cohort was unbalanced 
since there were 594 males and 142 females.  
Most patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group were White and few were Asian (n=63). Higher incidence 
of AEs (including infections) was observed in Asian patients. 
A higher incidence of venous thromboembolism has been observed in post-marketing RA study A3921133 
compared to AS pivotal trials. Considering short follow up in AS pivotal trials, VTE events remain a concern 
for AS indication also.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A clinically relevant effect as measured by ASAS20/ASA40 has been demonstrated for tofacitinib 5 mg BD 
in the target population of adult patients with AS who have responded inadequately to conventional 
therapy.  Most of the secondary endpoints measuring mainly signs and symptoms, inflammation and QoL 
endpoints provide supportive results. For other disease domains such as spinal mobility and enthesitis 
only limited or only a trend in effect was seen.  
Infections were the only reported AE of Special Interest in the AS studies; 7 cases of HZ (all non-serious) 
were reported. Platelet decrease has been observed during the AS trials (mean change from baseline until 
48 weeks of –30,000). There are concerns regarding the risk of bleeding for patients with low platelet 
counts (<100,000/mm3), since a reduction in platelets is observed with tofacitinib also in the other 
indications. 
In general, from the available safety data no new important safety concerns emerge, the safety profile 
seems overlapping with what already known from other approved indications. However, patient’s 
exposure is limited, and the sought indication is a chronic disease, requiring long-term therapy. The MAH 
considers the long-term safety profile of tofacitinib in the AS population as similar to what observed for

EMA/CHMP/743175/2021 
Page 213/215 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RA and PsA patients and, thus, the MAH does not plan to conduct further studies to gather long-term 
safety data from the AS population. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits of using tofacitinib for the treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis who 
have responded inadequately to conventional therapy are considered to outweigh the risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xeljanz is positive in the following indication: 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who 
have responded inadequately to conventional therapy.

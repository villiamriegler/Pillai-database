2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Currently, there are no commercial amino acid formulations approved for use in the reduction of renal 
radiation  exposure  during  treatment  with  177Lu  oxodotreotide  or  other  RSAs.  A  Lys-Arg  solution, 
preferably  2.5%,  is  prepared  by  pharmacies  and  must  be  administered  concomitantly  with  177Lu 
oxodotreotide for renal protection according to the 177Lu oxodotreotide EU SmPC. Approval of LysaKare 
would  allow  availability  of  a  commercially  produced  2.5%  Lys-Arg  solution  with  adequately  controlled 
quality in the target population, which is seen as a benefit regarding standardization and quality control 
compared with locally produced products derived from hospital pharmacies. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication of LysaKare applied for is ”Reduction of renal radiation exposure during Peptide-Receptor 
Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide in adults”.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology, risk factors and prevention 
Studies that included patients receiving RSA therapy in the absence of amino acid protection reported 
nephrotoxicity in the range of 28% to 60% (Otte 1999, Bodei 2015). Estimates for kidney dose limits 
were originally derived from experience with external beam radiation whose deep tissue penetration 
resulted in a renal limiting dose of 18-23 Gy (Svensson 2015, Wessels 2008), with radiation dose 
associated with a 5% risk for developing radiation nephropathy within 5 years being 23 Gy (Emami 1991). 
There are several confounding factors that can increase the risk of radiation induced-nephropathy, 
including age, baseline kidney function, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, prior course of chemotherapy, 
and presence of renal morphological abnormalities.  
The type of radionuclide can also affect rates of injury. This is thought to be largely dependent on whether 
beta emission energies are high enough to significantly extend their reach from the proximal tubule 
lumen to the radiosensitive glomeruli (Valkema 2005, Cremonesi 2006). For example, the maximum 
range of ß- particles from 90Y is 12 mm, which is long enough to reach the glomeruli as opposed to the 10 
µm range of Auger electrons which are too short to even leave the tubular cell. In contrast, 177Lu beta 
emissions have a maximal penetration range of 2.1 mm, suggesting that the glomeruli may be partially 
spared. Incidence and severity of long term renal injury were reduced with the use of 177Lu instead of 90Y 
for RSAs. 
Long term kidney toxicities based on creatinine clearance have been reported to be higher in patients 
treated with peptides labeled with 90Y and combinations of 90Y-177Lu than with 177Lu alone (Bodei 2008, 
Bodei 2015), although some studies have reported that mean change in GFR rates was similar to that 
seen with normal aging (-1% per year) (Sabet 2014a, Sabet 2015, Glasscock 2009). However, some 
other studies have noticed that the mean GFR change was not really representative of the variability in 
GFR change seen between individuals or related to cumulative radiation dose (Sabet 2014a, Sabet 
2014b). A retrospective study by Imhoff et al. (2011) reported that a high renal absorbed radiation dose 
was associated with a higher risk for radiation induced renal injury. 
Since the introduction of amino acids for renal protection during RSA therapy in the late 1990’s to early 
2000’s, nephrotoxicity rates post-RSA treatment have been estimated to be approximately 1% to 23%, 
with differences in the radionuclide and amino acid solution likely contributing to variations observed 
(Bodei 2015, Brabander 2017).

2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Radiolabelled peptide analogues, such as 177Lu oxodotreotide, are designed to target tumoral cells/tissues 
expressing their respective binding substrates. However, non-receptor mediated uptake is also observed 
for some peptide analogues, most notably in the kidneys. The amount of radioactivity retained in the 
kidneys has a significant impact on the total activity that can be administered to a patient because of 
potential long-term nephrotoxic effects caused by relatively high radiation doses to the organ. Clinical and 
histological findings have been related to radiation nephropathy during RSA treatment.  
Without renal protection, the kidneys are a dose-limiting organ during PRRT with radiolabelled peptides 
susceptible to renal resorption such as RSAs (Bodei 2015). Radiation induced pathophysiology is related 
to organ and cellular radiation dose and the ability of cells to repair induced damage. Depending on the 
dose, irradiation may also induce a chronic state of oxidative stress by the generation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). These ROS inactivate mitochondrial enzymes and damage the DNA which may lead to cell 
apoptosis. Angiotensin II is an important mediator in the progression of renal disease. It primarily 
up-regulates the levels of several cytokines, e.g. interleukin-8 (IL-8), promoting monocyte/macrophage 
and neutrophil migration, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, stimulating the proliferation of 
fibroblasts (Perico 2005). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis cause decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and loss 
of protein in the urine and lead to progressive kidney damage (Perico 2005). This becomes apparent as 
increased serum creatinine and decreased creatinine clearance. 
2.1.5.  Management 
A Lys-Arg solution, preferably 2.5%, must be administered concomitantly with 177Lu oxodotreotide for 
renal protection. The amino acids solution will help to decrease reabsorption of lutetium (177Lu) 
oxodotreotide through the proximal tubules, resulting in a significant reduction in the kidney radiation 
dose. When the recommended concomitant amino acids infusion is delivered over a 4 hour time span, a 
mean reduction in kidney radiation exposure of about 47% has been reported (Lutathera EU SmPC). 
Renal absorbed dose is considered to be an important endpoint related to the renal protective effects of 
lysine and arginine (Hammond 1993, Kwekkeboom 2001, Rolleman 2003, Bodei 2003, Jamar 2003, 
Kashyap 2013). RSA maximum allowable dose is based on estimates of exposure to the most sensitive 
organ serving as the dose limiting organ. In the case of PRRT with RSAs, the kidney is the dose limiting 
organ in the absence of amino acid co-infusion. The ultimate consequence of reducing radiation exposure 
during therapy with 177Lu oxodotreotide and other RSAs is that higher doses of RSAs can be used, 
potentially improving tumour response to the PRRT (Jamar 2003, Kong 2014). 
About the product 
The active substances L-lysine HCl and L-arginine HCl are positively charged amino acids produced and 
tested according to the standards of the European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.) as supported by a Certificate 
of Suitability to the Monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) issued by EDQM. L-lysine HCl and 
L-arginine HCl comply respectively with Ph. Eur. 0930 and Ph. Eur. 0805. 
The LysaKare 25 g / 25 g solution for infusion is supplied as a sterile, ready-to-use solution for infusion 
which will be administered intravenously in concomitance with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide in adults. 
The finished product claims to be able to reduce the proximal tubular reabsorption of low molecular 
weight proteins and peptides. Radiation dose to kidneys is of clinical significance during treatment with

radiolabeled somatostatin analogues (RSAs) because of the high tubular uptake of the peptide after 
glomerular filtration and retention of the radionuclides in the proximal tubular cells. 
The container closure system consists of a single use infusion plastic bag of 1000 mL. A single bag 
contains 25 g of L-Lysine Hydrochloride (HCl) and 25 g of L-Arginine Hydrochloride (HCl) in water for 
injections. 
Mechanism of action 
LysaKare is to be used during PRRT with a radiolabelled somatostatin analogue, lutetium (177Lu) 
oxodotreotide. Following LysaKare administration, L-lysine HCl and L-arginine HCl undergo glomerular 
filtration and, via competition, interfere with renal resorption of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide, reducing 
the radiation dose delivered to the kidney. 
Posology and method of administration 
The recommended treatment regimen in adults consists of i.v. infusion of the above mentioned full bag of 
LysaKare, even when patients require lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide dose reduction. The infusion must 
occur at the same time as the PRRT to achieve optimal renal protection. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
In accordance with Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the application relies on 
well-established medicinal use supported by bibliographic literature. According to Article 10a of Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended it is possible to replace results of pre-clinical and clinical trials by detailed 
references to published scientific literature (information available in the public domain) if it can be 
demonstrated that the active substance of a medicinal product has been in well-established medicinal use 
within the Community for at least 10 years, with a recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. 
In this regard, the provisions of Annex I (Part II.1) to Directive 2001/83/EC shall apply. 
To determine if the application fulfils the requirements of Article 10a with regards to well-established 
medicinal use of Lys-Arg for renal protection during PRRT with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide, the CHMP 
took into account the following factors: 
- Time over which the substance has been used 
The LysaKare formulation, based on a 2.5% Lysine HCl + 2.5% Arginine HCl (2.5% Lys-Arg) amino acid 
solution, is clinically used for renal radiation protection during PRRT since at least the year 2000, per the 
results of a survey conducted by the applicant in 29 clinical centres in six representative EU countries (ES, 
DE, NL, PT, AT, UK). 
The publication by Kwekkeboom (2001), proving a significant reduction in renal radiation exposure by 
administration of a 2.5% Lys-Arg solution in LysaKare’s target population, introduced this precaution to 
the clinical practice. 
The scientific literature reports the use of a 2.5% Lys-Arg solution in LysaKare’s target population since 
2001 (see Table 1) 
- Quantitative aspects of use of the substance 
The LysaKare formulation, based on a 2.5% Lysine HCl + 2.5% Arginine HCl (2.5% Lys-Arg) amino acid 
solution, is extensively clinically used in order to reduce the renal radiation exposure during RSA 
treatment, e.g. as part of the “Rotterdam Protocol”, which was also used in the Erasmus MC reports (see 
section 2.5.2.  The above mentioned survey showed that 2.5% Lys-Arg solution has been administered in 
29 clinical centres in six EU countries in the claimed indication to more than 3300 patients since 2000. Of

note, the incidence of all patients with the malignancy for which PRRT with lutetium (177Lu) 
oxodotreotide is indicated in the EU can be estimated at 2.17/100000 (Gatta 2011). 
Key scientific societies such as the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the European Neuro 
Endocrine Tumours Society (ENETS), and The North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS) 
recommend univocally the use of 2.5% Lys-Arg solution for the reduction of renal absorbed radiation dose 
in their treatment guidelines for gastroenteropancreatic NETs (Zaknun et al., 2013; Hicks et al., 2017). 
The same applies to the 177Lu oxodotreotide EU SmPC (Lutathera EU SmPC). This supports widespread 
use of the LysaKare formulation in its target population. 
- The degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published scientific 
literature) 
Pubmed was searched up to 2017 for full-text publications of the use of 2.5 % Lys-Arg solutions in 
LysaKare’s target population. The search identified 29 peer reviewed publications since 2001 (see Table 
1), providing evidence for the high degree of scientific interest in this orphan indication.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile solution for infusion. A single 1 litre infusion bag contains 25 g of L-lysine 
hydrochloride (HCl) and 25 g of L-arginine hydrochloride (HCl) in water for injections.  
The active substances, L-lysine HCl and L-arginine HCl are positively charged amino acids produced and 
tested according to the standards of the European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.) as supported by a Certificate 
of Suitability to the Monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) issued by EDQM. L-lysine HCl and 
L-arginine HCl comply with Ph. Eur. 0930 and Ph. Eur. 0805, respectively. 
The compatibility of the active substances with each other and with the excipient used in the formulation 
of the finished product has been demonstrated by a stability study. The results obtained during the 
stability assessment (up to 24 months shelf life) have shown that the variation of the two active 
substances assay value is in the range of ± 5 %. Both identification and assay tests at the storage 
temperature of 5 ± 3°C did not point out any significant variation in retention time, molecular weight and 
amount of the active substance. 
The excipient (water for injection) is well known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is compliant 
with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
LysaKare 25 g / 25 g solution for infusion is able to reduce the proximal tubular reabsorption of low 
molecular weight proteins and peptides. Exposure of radiation to the kidneys is of clinical significance 
during treatment with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues (RSAs) because of the high tubular uptake of 
the peptide after glomerular filtration and the retention of the radionuclides in the proximal tubular cells. 
It is reported that positively charged amino acids, such as L-lysine and/or L-arginine, are co-infused to 
competitively inhibit the proximal tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide, to counteract and reduce the 
high kidney retention of radiopeptides. 
Based on the documented clinical experience, the 2.5% Lys-Arg formulation appeared to be the most 
suitable one in terms of renal protection, efficacy and tolerability. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/363968/2019  
Page 17/62 
 
 
 
Based on the above evidence, the European Medicine Agency (EMA) agreed to include a lysine-arginine 
solution as renal protectant with Lutathera. In the absence of a commercial solution specifically tailored 
for this purpose, the agency recommended to use commercial amino acid solutions for parenteral 
nutrition with lysine and arginine contents in the range of 18-24 g. 
LysaKare 25 g / 25 g solution for infusion conforms to all required physico-chemical and microbiological 
characteristics for the parenteral products as described in ICH Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and 
Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemicals Substances. 
The following physical properties have been considered relevant to the performance of the finished 
product: appearance, pH and osmolality. 
During the development of the finished product, sodium chloride solution was replaced by water for 
injections to bring osmolarity closer to physiological values compared to other amino acid mixtures 
reported in the literature. The osmolality of the finished product has been tested on four batches and the 
recorded values were well within the accepted values. Using water for injections, the pH is about 5.6 
which is well in acceptable range of pH for intravenous infusions and similar to the pH of other complex 
amino acid mixtures that have been used for the reduction of renal radiation exposure during 
Peptide-Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) with RSAs.  
During the development of the finished product manufacturing process, critical process parameters were 
identified, evaluated and optimized. The process has been then adapted to industrial constraints related 
to ready-to-use preparations, such as the size of the infusion bag and the batch size. The commercial 
manufacturing process follows conventional drug compounding and filling methods commonly used in the 
pharmaceutical industry.  
The finished product manufacturer has chosen a moist heat terminal sterilization method for the finished 
product, as recommended by Ph. Eur. 5.1.1 for aqueous solutions. The standard conditions for the moist 
heat sterilisation (15 minutes at 121°C) couldn’t be followed, due to the large volume of solution packed 
in the container used (1 litre). Therefore, the finished product manufacturer adopted another combination 
of time and temperature (40 minutes at 118°C) using moist heat terminal sterilization with and F0>8 
minutes assuring a SAL (sterility assurance level) of 10-6. This approach is in line with the 
recommendation of Ph. Eur. 5.1.1. The proposed combination of time and temperature for the terminal 
sterilisation cycle has been validated accordingly and it has been satisfactorily demonstrated that the 
process chosen delivers an adequate and reproducible level of lethality when operating routinely within 
the established tolerances. 
The primary packaging is an infusion bag made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) wrapped in a polyethylene 
polyamine/aluminium foil. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. Chemical analysis, mechanical/physical tests have been conducted in accordance with Ph.Eur. 
3.2.2.1 and Ph.Eur. 3.2.3 (extractables, leachables, and container closure) which demonstrate that the 
chosen primary packaging is adequate for its intended use.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  6  main  steps:  weighing  of  raw  materials  and  recovering  of 
adequate volume of water for injection, compounding of the bulk solution, filtration, filling of pre-printed 
infusion bags, sterilisation by autoclave, and drying and packaging in overwrap. The process is considered 
to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/363968/2019  
Page 18/62 
 
 
 
 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identification L-lysine (HPLC), identification L-arginine (HPLC), pH, 
extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), assay L-lysine (HPLC), assay L-arginine (HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC-UV), sterility test (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), number of 
sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.) and Phtalates (HPLC-UV).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
According to the guideline for elemental impurities (International Council on Harmonisation (ICH), Q3D), 
the potential elemental impurities in the finished product were assessed. It was confirmed that the 
contamination risk from the equipment and the packaging used for manufacturing of the finished product 
is low. The ratio of potential uptake for each elemental impurities against Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) 
described in the guideline for elemental impurities (ICH, Q3D) was calculated and the results indicated 
that the potential uptake for each element was less than 30% of the PDE. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 4 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing without outer 
layer  of  PET  (polyethylene  terephthalate).  The  attributes  of  the  container  closure  system  of  the 
commercial product are otherwise similar to those used in the registration product stability protocol. It 
has been demonstrated that the stability attributes of the lidding foils, with and without the outer PET 
layer, are equivalent. 
Samples were tested in line with the shelf-life specifications. The analytical procedures used were stability 
indicating.  
The physical-chemical tested parameters for all evaluated batches of the finished product were within the 
quality shelf-life specification for over the tested period with no deterioration recorded when the product 
was stored under long term conditions. The finished product also showed good stability when stored at 
accelerate conditions as demonstrated by the results recorded for all tested parameters within the tested 
period  with  no  deterioration  in  physico-chemical  characteristics  and  no  significant  change  or  out  of 
specification results. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Photostability testing results indicated that light had no influence on 
the quality of the product. No special storage precautions for light are required. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months store bellow 25°C as stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  information  in  this  application  is  derived  entirely  from  pharmacodynamic, 
pharmacokinetic, and toxicology data in the scientific literature.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic studies  
No non-clinical literature examining the renal protective effects of the combination of Lysine and Arginine 
was presented.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
With  regard  to  cardiovascular  safety,  Boldt  et  al.  (2009)  reported  an  ex  vivo  study  with  lysine, 
demonstrating a transient positive inotropic effect at concentration of 10 mM. Two studies have been 
identified concerning the effects of L-arginine on the cardiovascular system in healthy dogs. One study 
determined  the  effects  of  the  intravenous  administration  of  L-arginine  on  hemodynamics  including 
cardiac output and renal blood flow. Results of this study showed that arginine produces an elevation of 
renal blood flow without having a significant effect on mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac 
output at the tested doses. The second study evaluated the hemodynamic splanchnic and renal changes 
after intravenous administration of arginine-hydrochloride. Systemic arterial blood flow and heart rate 
was not influenced but a local blood flow increasing effect on the arteries next to the pancreas couldn’t be 
completely ruled out. 
No additional literature is provided assessing respiratory or CNS related effects of L-lysine or L-arginine.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The nonclinical information presented on the toxicological evaluation of lysine and arginine to support the 
marketing  application  is  literature  based  and  derived  from  publicly  available  scientific  sources.  Acute 
toxicity data were presented for mice, rats and dogs with after parenteral administration. As was the case 
for pharmacology data, more toxicology data on lysine than arginine are presented. One study in mice 
was cited without toxicology relevance (MTD for L-lysine 2500 µg/g i.p.). Another study reported an LD50 
in rats of about 3-4 g/kg for L-lysine and L-arginine (administered as acute i.p. doses) corresponding to 
human  equivalent  doses  of  480-645  mg/kg  based  on  body  surface  area  conversion.  Dyspnoe, 
hypothermia  and  extreme  prostration  at  this  dose  are  reported.  One  effect  identified  in  dogs  was 
dose-dependent hyperkalemia after i.v. administration of L-lysine or L-arginine.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substances are natural substances, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, L-arginine hydrochloride and L-lysine 
hydrochloride are not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  presented  non-clinical  data  package  is  based  on  bibliographic  information  for  lysine  and  arginine 
available from the public domain. No new non-clinical studies have been performed for this application 
since the application is based on well-established use according to Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
This is is acceptable from a non-clinical point of view due to the long-term clinical experience with both 
amino acids. 
Pharmacodynamic 
The applicant provided literature showing the protective influence of the positively charged amino acids 
lysine  and  arginine.  Although  no  literature  exists  to  date  where  both  amino  acids  have  been  tested 
together  for  renal  protection  during  PRRT  in  a  non-clinical  setting,  the  protective  effect  of 
co-administration  has  been  demonstrated  in  clinical  practice  over  many  years.  The  megalin/cubulin 
receptor  complex  is  responsible  for  the  renal  resorption  of  radiolabelled  peptides  and  competitive 
inhibiton of this transporter is believed to be the primary target mediating the renal-protective effects of 
L-lysine and L-arginine (Melis 2005, Vegt 2011, Behr 1995). Somatostatin receptors may also play a role 
in mediating these effects but are not believed to be the major contributor. 
Safety pharmacology 
To address the safety pharmacology of the actives the applicant has submitted a summary of studies 
investigating the effects of exogenous lysine or L-arginine administration on cardiovascular function in 
non-clinical species. The combined effect of L-Lysine and L-arginine on ex-vivo cardiac tissue contractility 
has also been investigated. The data presented do not indicate a cardiovascular safety risk, given the lack 
of cardiac effects attributed to the co-infused amino acid solution in the clinic. 
No evidence of effects of L-lysine or L-arginine on the respiratory system or the CNS has been reported in 
published animal studies. The lack of dedicated non-clinical investigations of respiratory and CNS effects 
is acceptable, given the extensive clinical experience and the lack of a clinical concern. 
Pharmacokinetic 
Non-clinical pharmacokinetic information is unavailable. This is acceptable, given the available clinical 
pharmacokinetic information. 
Toxicology 
Acute toxicity data of AA  solutions has been described in dogs, rats and mice. The main toxicological 
findings  are  attributed  to  lysine  and  describe  dyspnoe,  hypothermia  and  extreme  prostration.  These 
findings are thought not to be of clinical relevance given the high dose of the amino acid administered in 
this study relative to the proposed clinical dose (corresponding to human equivalent doses of 480-645 
mg/kg based on body surface area conversion). Other identified toxicological findings from the submitted 
studies relate to hyperkalaemia, elevated blood ammonia levels and increased urine bicarbonate content. 
Given the heterogeneity in the quality of the studies and differing administration methods the relevance 
of these findings to humans is unknown. Based on  nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology data, the 
effects of L-arginine and L-lysine combination are not thought to be additive. 
There are no literature data provided on repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive 
toxicity, local tolerance or other toxicity studies.  This is considered acceptable given the nature of the 
actives and proposed indication and posology of LysaKare, and this lack of information is reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Finally, since both amino acids are naturally occurring biomolecules, there is no need for ERA studies as 
they are considered not to be associated with any additional risk for the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
The route of administration of LysaKare is IV. Thus, assessment of absorption is not applicable. 
Distribution 
No studies describing the distribution of L-arginine and L-lysine when given in combination have been 
provided. One study (Bode-Böger, 1998) has data on the distribution of L-arginine (varying from 33 L/kg 
in  the  30  g  i.v.  dose  to  68  L/kg  in  the  6  g  i.v.  dose),  and  one  study  (Irving,  1986)  has  data  on  the 
distribution of L-lysine (initial Vd 195 mL/kg, total Vd 1523 mL/kg). The high total volume of distribution 
of 1.5 L/kg for L-Lysin was also explained by uptake into the tissue where intracellular lysine levels exceed 
those in plasma. 
Elimination 
L-Lysine and L-Arginine are naturally occurring molecules. Due to their small size, they are subject to 
glomerular filtration and subsequent resorption in the kidney. Urinary excretion of amino acids is normally 
very small, that is below 1% of the filtered load. The proximal tubule and thin ascending limb of Henle’s 
loop  serve  as  the  sites  for  resorption.  Amino  acid  resorption  in  the  kidneys  involves  transepithelial 
transport, requiring transporters (b0,+ and y+L) on the apical and basolateral membranes of the tubular 
cells. 
• 
L-arginine: Excretion was dose dependent. Tmax was 22-30 min depending on amount infused 
during continuous iv infusion. Half-life was dose-dependent (42 ± 2 min, 60 ± 9 min, and 76 ± 9 
min for 30 g i.v., 6 g i.v., and 6 g p.o., respectively). AUC (0, ∞) values showed a proportional 
increase with increasing doses of L-arginine. Urinary excretion occurred only within the first 90 
min, during which the renal threshold for reabsorption was presumably exceeded. After this initial 
urinary  loss,  plasma  L-arginine  declined  slowly  by  non-renal  clearance  (about  5  mL/min/kg). 
Maximal renal clearance of i.v. L-arginine during the first 90 min post-dose in 2 volunteers was 
1.16 and 1.18 mL/min/kg. Average non-renal clearance was 360 mL/min. Table 3.  summarises 
the pharmacokinetic data of the study by Tangphao. 
• 
L-lysine: The terminal half-life of i.v. administered lysine was estimated to be around 177 min. 
Specific pharmacokinetic studies of the combination of L-lysine and L-arginine are not available.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
For  L-arginine  there  is  not  dose  proportionality,  and  Vd,  Cl  and  t½  declines  with  higher  doses.  The 
provided literature does not discuss possible dose proportionality of L-lysine.  
Time dependency 
LysaKare is not expected to show time dependency. No evidence regarding time dependency is provided 
in the referenced literature.  
No data after multiple doses have been provided. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function: Given that L-lysine and L-arginine PK (and clinical activity) are dependent in 
part  on  normal  renal  perfusion  and  resorption,  perturbations  in  renal  function  may  affect  therapeutic 
effects. Chronic renal failure has been associated with an increase in amino acid urinary excretion as it can 
be  associated  with  a  greater  filtered  load  saturating  renal  resorption  processes  (review  by  Silbernagl 
1988). 
Impaired hepatic function: LysaKare does not undergo hepatic metabolism and thus impaired hepatic 
function is not expected to influence the PK of LysaKare.  
Gender: Gender is not known to influence the PK of LysaKare.  
Race: Race is not known to influence the PK of LysaKare. 
Weight: Weight is not known to influence the PK of LysaKare. 
Elderly: LysaKare is not known to exhibit different PK in elderly patients. 
Children: LysaKare is not known to exhibit different PK in paediatric patients. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No reports for clinical studies evaluating extrinsic factors relating to lysine and arginine PK are available.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The effect on the megalin/cubulin transport complex is associated with the cationic properties of Arg and 
Lys and has been exploited for use in reducing the renal radiation exposure during PRRT therapy with 
177Lu-DOTATATE and other RSAs. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Mogensen and Solling (1977) found that substances with a positively charged group located terminally in 
the molecule (ornithine, lysine, arginine, and the almost not metabolized epsilon-amino-caproic acid and 
cyclocaprone) proved to instantaneously inhibit renal tubular protein resorption. Lysine was found to be 
most effective in promoting urinary excretion of albumin, Ig light chains, and Beta-2-microglobulin, while 
arginine had a lesser effect. 
Results  from  multiple  clinical  studies  show  that  in  patients  receiving  PRRT  with  RSAs,  amino  acids 
interfere  with  renal  resorption  of  the  radiolabeled  peptides.  In  these  studies,  formulations  of  L-lysine 
alone or combinations of L-lysine and L-arginine have performed similarly or better than complex amino 
acid  mixtures.  These  observations  indicate  that  amino  acids,  and  more  specifically  L-lysine,  and 
L-arginine act by a similar mechanism of action to prevent renal resorption of RSAs in patients as they do 
with endogenous protein resorption in healthy subjects. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate 
the contributions of each amino acid to clinical effects of reduced renal radiation absorbed dose. Results 
from these studies have shown that a 2.5% L-Lysine HCl, 2.5% L-Arginine HCl combination provides an 
better  risk  benefit  balance  to  patients  compared  to  complex  amino  acid  mixtures,  lysine  only 
formulations, and other combinations of lysine and arginine. 
Secondary pharmacology 
L-arginine has also been associated with nitric oxide synthesis, vasodilation leading to decreased blood 
pressure and compensatory increase in heart rate (Bode-Böger 1994, Bode-Böger 1998) – see Figure 3.

Figure 3.  Blood Pressure Effects of Intravenous L-arginine (Bode-Boger 1998) 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
 L-arginine  has  been  shown  to  decrease  blood  pressure.  A  pharmacodynamic  interaction  with 
anti-hypertensive drugs and other vasodilatating drugs has not been investigated. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
LysaKare is not known to exhibit a different PD response due to genetic differences. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
No discussion or studies describing a relationship between plasma concentration and effect have been 
provided and no studies investigating the relationship between dose and the degree of inhibition of renal 
resorption of 177Lu-DOTATATE have been provided. However in the study by Mogensen (1977), different 
amino acids are administered in different doses, and are found to induce renal excretion of a range of 
different peptides.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Assessment report

The applicant has not provided any pharmacokinetic data on the administration of LysaKare or any other 
combination  of  L-arginine  and  L-lysine.  All  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  come  from  studies 
administrating either L-arginine or L-lysine. Moreover, the study investigating the PK of L-lysine used a 
far smaller dose of L-lysine than the dose proposed to be administered with LysaKare. For L-arginine, the 
dose used in the studies investigating the PK is also (slightly) different from the dose proposed to be 
administered with LysaKare, and is infused over 30 min, and not as with LysaKare over 4 hours. Thus, 
pharmacokinetics  of  Lysakare  is  based  on  extrapolation  of  results  obtained  with  the  individual 
components (L-arginine and L-lysine) in amounts not identical to the ones used in Lykare. Considering the 
nature of the components and the short duration of treatment, this is considered acceptable. 
For  L-arginine  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  are  expected  to  be  approximately  as  follows:  A  Vd  of 
33L/kg body weight, a half-life of 42 min and a clearance of 544 mL/min. There is no dose proportionality, 
and high doses lead to saturation of renal resorption with urinary excretion as a consequence, however it 
is not known whether the infusion of LysaKare will lead to urinary excretion. 
For L-lysine the half life is short, approximately 177 min and Vd seems to be smaller than for L-arginine 
(around 1523 mL/kg body weight). It is not known whether dose proportionality exists. No accumulation 
would  be  expected  as  the  amino  acid  solution  will be  administered  parallel  to Lutathera,  which  has  a 
recommended interval between each administration of 8 weeks.  
Transient  elevations  in  plasma  arginine  and  lysine  are  observed  after  intravenous  administration, 
whereupon the highly water soluble amino acids are quickly distributed throughout tissues and body fluid.
Like other naturally occurring amino acids, arginine and lysine serve as building blocks in protein 
anabolism and serve as precursors for several other products, including nitric oxide, urea, creatinine, and 
Acetyl-Coenzyme A. 
Arginine and lysine are rapidly distributed. Based on a study with 30 g arginine infused over 30 minutes, 
plasma elimination of amino acids follows at least a biphasic or triphasic decline, with levels returning to 
baseline within 6 hours post-dose. Initial rapid clearance is through glomerular filtration in the kidney in 
the first 90 minutes post-infusion. Remaining amino acid is removed by non-renal clearance. 
No studies describing the pharmacokinetics in target- or special populations have been provided. The 
studies provided to support the pharmacokinetics of LysaKare provide only a scarce understanding of the 
pharmacokinetics of LysaKare. LysaKare is contraindicated if GFR < 30 mL/min, but no discussion of the 
impact of impaired renal function with a GFR > 30 mL/min has been provided. This is acceptable, given 
the LysaKare and Lutathera use restriction in this population in their PIs. PK in low or high body weight 
and PK in the elderly is not known, but expected to be similar to PK in healthy subjects.  
As also discussed, taking into account the large inter-administration intervals of 8 weeks associated with 
the Lutathera dosing regimen, there is no opportunity for L-Lysine and L-Arginine to accumulate. 
No interaction studies have been performed. This is acceptable, as no interaction with other medicinal 
product is expected since there is no information that other drugs are re-absorbed by the same kidney 
re-absorption mechanism (SmPC, section 4.5). 
Interactions 
No studies on interactions have been provided. Since LysaKare consists of naturally occurring amino acids 
with known excretion pathways, it is not expected to interact with other medicines. It is however noted in 
the  EPAR  for  Lutathera,  as  described  under  the  section  excretion,  that  a  combination  of  L-lysine  and 
L-arginine changes the elimination of Lutathera. This effect is known and is the basis for development of 
LysaKare. 
It has to be taken into account that this is a well-established use application for an amino acid solution 
which has been used in similar composition in combination with Peptide-Receptor Radionuclide Therapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/363968/2019  
Page 32/62 
 
 
 
 
for  over  a  decade  to  treat  patients  with  rare  diseases  like  somatostatin  receptor  positive 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. Data on clinical efficacy and safety discussed further 
below  are  overall  regarded  to  be  sufficient  to  assess  benefit-risk,  even  though  the  aforementioned 
limitations in pharmacokinetic profiling exist.  
Pharmacodynamics 
As discussed by the applicant, the intravenous route of delivery ensures that the amino acids are 100% 
systemically available where they will become subject to glomerular filtration and can then interfere with 
transporter systems in the proximal tubule membrane and prevent substrate binding and subsequent 
resorption of the radiolabelled peptides. 
Co-infusion of LysaKare with Lutathera ensures that L-Lysine and L-Arginine are present during the period 
when renal radiation exposure is highest and plasma levels will drop down to normal within few hours 
after infusion is stopped.  
With regard to PD, the provided information gives an adequate insight on the proposed mechanism of 
action. L-Lysine and L-Arginine are naturally occurring molecules. Due to their small size, they are subject 
to glomerular filtration and subsequent resorption in the kidney. High doses of these amino acids have 
been shown to interfere with resorption of endogenous peptides. It is this property that is being exploited 
for their use for reducing the renally absorbed radiation dose during Lutathera therapy.  
From a safety pharmacology point of view, after infusion of LysaKare, a secondary pharmacological effect 
of the infusion could e.g. be vasodilation, possibly leading to decreased blood pressure and compensatory 
increase in heart rate, possibly leading to blood pressure lowering effects in heart failure and possibly to 
pharmacodynamic  interactions  of  LysaKare  with  antihypertensive  medicinal  products.  However,  as 
treatment duration is very short and as autoregulatory mechanisms including the baroreceptor reflex will 
limit any effect, the lack of formal investigation is considered acceptable. 
The use of arginine and lysine has not been specifically studied in patients with renal impairment. Arginine 
and lysine are substantially excreted and reabsorbed by the kidney, and their efficacy in the reduction of 
renal radiation exposure is dependent on this. Due to the potential for clinical complications related to 
volume overload and an increase of potassium in blood associated with the use of LysaKare, this product 
should not be administered in patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. Care should be taken with 
LysaKare use in patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 mL/min. Treatment with lutetium 
(177Lu) oxodotreotide is not recommended for patients with renal function between 30 and 50 mL/min 
therefore,  the  benefit  risk  for  these  patients  will  always  need  to  be  weighed  carefully,  which  should 
include consideration of an increased risk for transient hyperkalemia in these patients (SmPC, section 
4.4). 
The use of arginine and lysine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Care 
should be taken with LysaKare use in patients with severe hepatic impairment and in case of either total 
bilirubinemia >3 times the upper limit of normal or albuminemia <30 g/L and prothrombin ratio <70% 
during  treatment.  Treatment  with  lutetium  (177Lu)  oxodotreotide  is  not  recommended  in  these 
circumstances (SmPC, section 4.4). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Taking into account that this is a well-established use application for an amino acid solution which has 
been used in similar composition in combination with Peptide-Receptor Radionuclide therapy for over a 
decade to treat patients with rare diseases like somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic 
neuroendocrine  tumours  and  in  light  of  the  indication  proposed,  namely  to  reduce  renal  radiation

exposure during Peptide-Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), overall, the PK and PD properties are 
acceptably described by the referenced literature.  
Regarding PD, the mechanism of action is considered sufficiently described. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Rolleman 2003 
Study design: A prospective, comparison, single center, crossover study. 
Study Participants: Patients with end-stage NET, receiving RSA treatment. 
Treatments:  Patients  received  RSA  (111In-DTPA-octreotid,  not  the  177-DOTATATE,  which  is  the  RSA 
intended for use in combination with LysaKare) treatment with and without other amino-acid co-infusion 
than the Lysakare formulation. To study the effect of volume administration alone, patients received 500, 
1000, or 2000 mL of 0.45% saline, 2.5% glucose solution administered as a 4-hour infusion started 30 
minutes prior to RSA treatment. 
Objective: to compare the effects of various amino-acid formulations and the effects of volume infusion 
alone on radiation uptake in the kidneys in patients receiving RSA treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints:  Radiation  uptake  in  kidney,  tumour  and  spleen  were  measured  for  up  to  72 
hours post-RSA administration. Side effects were also recorded.  
Sample size: 26 patients. 
Results: Saline had no effects on radiation uptake in kidneys, tumours, or spleen at any volume tested, 
showing that there was no infusion effect on radiation uptake. The amino acid solutions were all effective 
in reducing renal radiation uptake scores as described in Table 4 below. The most significant decrease in 
renal uptake was seen in the first 24 hours post-RSA treatment, the effects remained significant through 
72 hours post-RSA administration.

Study design: Single center, cross over study. AA- treatment was not randomized, and only given with 
the second RSA treatment. 
Study  participants:  Patients  with  medullary 
thyroid 
cancer,  non-Hodgkin

gastroenteropancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumours  (GEP-NET),  aesthesioneuroblastoma,  Hürthle  cell 
thyroid carcinoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. 
Treatments: 177Lu- DOTATATE was administered twice separated by a 6-9 week interval. The amino acid 
co-infusion was given only with the second treatment, allowing comparison of dosimetry in the kidney 
with and without amino acid co-infusion in the same patient. The amino acid solution was made of 2.5% 
L-lysine HCl and 2.5% L-arginine HCl in 1L of 0.225% NaCl (2.5% Lys-Arg; not identical to Lysakare). The 
infusion  was  given  over  4  hours  at  a  rate  of  250  ml/h,  beginning  30  minutes  prior  to  RSA  treatment 
(“Rotterdam Protocol”).  
Objective: Comparison of dosimetry in the kidney with and without amino acid co-infusion in the same 
patient receiving RSA treatment (177Lu- DOTATATE). 
Outcomes/endpoints: Radiation uptake in kidney, Liver, spleen and Bone marrow.  
Sample size: 5 patients 
Results: 
From  Table  5  (below)  it  appears  that  the  absorbed  radiation  doses  in  the  kidneys  were  significantly 
reduced when the Lys-Arg solution was co-administered mean 47% (range 34-59%). No formal statistics 
has  been  presented.  Renal  dosimetry-data  for  Lys-Arg  co-administration  is  missing  for  patient  no.  2 
(Table 5), and age and sex has not been specified for any of the patients. 
No adverse events were reported.

minutes  before  177Lu-DOTATATE  administration)  has  been  applied  in  more  than  1200  NET  patients 
treated with 177Lu- DOTATATE, with a median follow-up period of more than 70 months.  
Another main study submitted is the Netter-1 multicenter Phase III trial in which two commercial amino

Sample size: 504 patients. Data from a total of 1772 administrations was available. 
Results: Acute adverse effects seen within 24 hours after PRRT administration were nausea after 25% of 
administrations, vomiting after 10% of administrations and abdominal discomfort or pain after 10% of 
administrations.  Six  patients  were  hospitalized  within  2  days  of  dosing  because  of  hormone-related 
crises.  
Subacute RSA-related hematological toxicity (WHO Grade 3 or 4) were seen 3-4 weeks after 3.6% of 
administrations, affecting 9.5% of patients. Temporary hair loss was seen in 62% of patients. Serious 
delayed  toxicities  were  seen  in  9  patients  (2  renal  insufficiency,  3  hepatic  toxicity/failure,  and  4 
myelodysplastic  syndrome).  The  renal  insufficiencies  were  attributed  to  pre-existing  factors  (existing 
renal function deterioration and increasing tricuspid valve insufficiency) rather than treatment. Delayed 
renal insufficiencies was observed in 2 cases (0.4 %), both grade 4, and were both thought to be related 
to pre-existing factors rather than RSA treatment.

Study Design: A retrospective study. 
Study  Participants:  Patients  with  somatostatin  receptor  positive  tumours,  who  received  177Lu- 
DOTATATE between January 2000 to January 2015. The study focused on 610 patients residing in The 
Netherlands, who had received at least 3.7 GBq radiation dose.  
Treatments: 177Lu- DOTATATE (1.85-7.4 GBq/dose) and 2.5% Lys-Arg for renal protection.  
Objective: To provide follow-up information on 610 patients in the Erasmus MC phase I/II study.  
Endpoint/outcome: Renal toxicity/creatinine clearance. 
Sample size: 610 patients 
Results: A median of 64 months follow-up data was available (range 58-70 months).

Creatinine grade 3 /4 toxicities occurred in 2/581 patients (0.3%). Serum creatinine levels normalized in 
all patients by 3 months after treatment completion. Renal failure was reported in 6 patients (1%) during 
follow-up. The most probable cause of the renal failure was postrenal in one patient (hydronephrosis) and 
prerenal in the other patients (hypotension after gastrointestinal bleeding in one patient and in 4 patients, 
dehydration caused by severe vomiting and diarrhea). 
The use of 2.5% Lys-Arg solution proved to be effective in reducing the renal radiation exposure, the 
mean kidney absorbed radiation dose being below the toxicity threshold. However, these data has not 
been  presented  in  the  application.  Renal  failure  was  observed  in  6/582  (~  1 %),  but  was  considered 
unrelated to RSA and AA treatment.  
Bergsma 2016b 
Study Design: A retrospective study, follow-up for 3 years post RSA. 
Study participants: Dutch patients with somatostatin positive tumours and no prior treatment with 
PRRT.  
Treatments: 177-DOTATATE (1.85-7.4 GBq/dose, up to 4 doses 6-16 week interval).  
Objective:  Bergsma  et  al  (2016b)  publication  is  a  companion  paper  to  the  Bergsma  et  al  (2016a) 
publication and focused on the nephrotoxicity. 
Outcomes/endpoints: Renal toxicity/creatinine clearance. Renal dosimetry.  
Sample Size: 323 patients. Follow-up data for 1, 2, and 3 years after the last therapy were available for 
209, 155 and 98 patients, respectively. 
Results: Renal dosimetry: the renal absorbed radiation dose was calculated in 228 patients and was 
determined to be 20.1 ± 4.9 Gy. One figure in Figure 4  (below) summarizes creatinine clearance toxicity 
based on CTCAE grade at 1, 2 and 3 years post treatment. Grade 1 renal toxicity (creatinine increase 
>26.5 µmol/L) was observed in 14 (4%) of patients. Three patients (1%) developed Grade 2 renal toxicity 
(creatinine increase >1.5 to 3X baseline or upper limit of normal). These were not considered related to 
therapy. Grade 3 kidney toxicity was observed in 5/323 patients. All 5 patients had a baseline clearance 
< 60 ml/min, making them more prone to more severe renal function impairment. One patient was lost 
to follow-up due to renal failure. No risk factors for renal toxicity could be identified. No CTCAE grade 4 
events were observed. 
The other figure in Figure 4 (below) summarizes the annual decrease in renal function based on creatinine 
clearance.  The  estimated  average  annual  decrease  in  clearance  (±  SD)  was  3.4  ±  0.4%  and  the 
estimated average baseline clearance was 108 ± 5 mL/min. In 203/208 patients, the annual decrease in 
renal function was < 10%. Five patients had an annual decrease in clearance of ≥ 10%, and 2 had an 
annual decrease of ≥ 15%. In 29/208 patients (14%) an improvement in renal function was observed. No 
patient showed an annual decrease in renal function of ≥ 20%.

Netter-1 (reported in Strosberg 2017a) 
Study Design: a prospective, randomized, open label, Phase III clinical study (Netter-1).  
Study  Participants:  Patients  with  advanced,  progressive,  somatostatin-receptor-positive  midgut 
neuroendocrine tumours.  The patients were enrolled from across 41 centers in the United States and 
Europe, between September 2012 through mid-January 2016. 
Treatments: Patients assigned to the 177Lu- DOTATATE were scheduled to receive 4 treatments of 7.4 
GBq (200 mCi) Lutathera and co-infusion with 2 L of a commercial amino acid mix starting 30 minutes 
prior to PRRT and administered for at least 4 hours. The two amino acid solutions allowed were Aminosyn 
II  10%  [21.0  g  of  L-lysine  and  20.4  g  L-arginine  in  2  L]  and  Vamin  18  [18  g  L-lysine  and  22.6  g 
L-arginine]. The octreotide long-acting release (LAR) control group received 60 mg every 4 weeks. 
Objective: To compare the tumour response of Lutathera (177Lu-DOTATATE) to long acting octreotide.  
Endpoint/outcome: Patients were evaluated for treatment response and safety, the outcome has not 
been further specified.  
Sample size: 229 patients 
Results: A total of 229 patients (116 males, 113 females) were enrolled. Median patient age was 63-64 
years in each group. Of the 229 enrolled, 221 received at least one dose, 77% of patients in the Lutathera 
arm completed all 4 planned doses. Patients were followed for up to 60 months (median 14 months). 
No evidence of renal toxic effects as detected by changes in creatinine clearance was seen during the 
observed timeframe (median follow-up 14 months) (Figure 5, below).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Age 
The effectiveness of amino-acids for renal protection during RSA treatment was shown in patients ranging 
from 11 to 91 years of age. The effectiveness of the 2.5% Lys-Arg formulation in particular and using the 
proposed dosing regimen was demonstrated in patients 17 to 89 years old (see subsection in Table 2. 
Studies evaluating Efficacy). 
Gender 
Males  and  females  were  well  represented  in  clinical  studies  for  amino-acids  and  2.5%  Lys-Arg,  with 
approximately 40% to 60% representation in most studies (see Table 2. Studies evaluating Efficacy). 
Tumor Type 
Patients with various NETs in multiple stages were represented across study populations. Tumor load was 
also considered (see Table 2. Studies evaluating Efficacy). 
Supportive study(ies) 
Fifteen additional publications reporting clinical use of 2.5% Lys-Arg for renal protection during treatment 
with 177Lu-DOTATATE or other RSAs were also submitted in support of this application (see Table 2). They 
provide data to support claims of well-established use of the 2.5% Lys-Arg solution for renal protection 
and/or additional information on safety and efficacy of the product. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
It  has  been  adequately  substantiated  that  concomitant  amino  acid  infusions  can  reduce  the  renally 
absorbed radiation dose and that this can translate into clinically significant kidney protection, whereby 
the most relevant study for this well-established use application is the Erasmus MC reports and, to a 
lesser extent, the Phase III Netter-1 study in which commercially available amino acid solutions were 
used for renal protection. Both studies are of good quality to substantiate efficacy.  
These  two  studies  are  also  the  pivotal  studies  for the  benefit  risk  assessment  in  the  present  MAA  for 
Lutathera. 
The experience at Erasmus MC on PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE is published in multiple articles. The renal 
protection  protocol  with  Lysine  2.5%  -  Arginine  2.5%  solution  (same  lysine  and  arginine  content  as 
LysaKare,  1  L,  4-hour  infusion,  starting  30  minutes  before  177Lu-DOTATATE  administration)  has  been 
applied in more than 1200 NET patients treated with 177Lu- DOTATATE, with a median follow-up period of 
more than 70 months. 
Clinical  data  gained  in  clinical  trials  with  other  amino  acid  solutions  with  similar  lysine  and  arginine 
content, such as complex commercial amino acid solution for parenteral nutrition, which have been used 
in  PRRT  with  177Lu-DOTATATE  or  other  RSAs,  have  also  been  considered  and  they  are  generally 
supportive for LysaKare safety and efficacy. It was clarified that the small differences in osmolality and pH 
of LysaKare the AA solutions used in the main studies supporting this application and will not affect its 
efficacy. 
As noted in the PK assessment, it is not possible to understand the pharmacokinetics of LysaKare in detail. 
However, it appears that different compositions of AA-solutions have a generally similar effect on renal 
reabsorption.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/363968/2019

The applicant reveals that ”the rationale of the 2.5% Lys-Arg formulation was primarily derived from the 
results of Rolleman et al. (2003), which demonstrated that 1 L of the formulation (25 g each amino acid) 
had similar efficacy (as determined by renal absorbed dose) but better tolerability (nausea and vomiting) 
compared  to  a  75g  lysine  only  formulation.”  However,  the  RSA  used  in  the  study  presented  was 
111In-DTPA-octreotid and not the 177-DOTATATE, which is the RSA intended for use in combination with 
LysaKare.  
No explicit dose response studies have been performed for LysaKare. The applicant cited and discussed 
clinical  studies  in  which  different  formulations  of  amino  acid  solutions  have  been  used  in  different 
treatment  protocols,  which  is  overall  regarded  acceptable  for  this  WEU  application  even  though 
dose-response study/studies with parallel groups with fixed titration to different maintenance doses per 
body weight of the i.v. solution LysaKare would have been preferable. 
The scientific rationale for the frequent use of the “Rotterdam Protocol” in the PRRT setting nowadays 
seems to a great extent to be based on the scientific knowledge which was gained in the clinical studies 
provided and discussed by the applicant. The dose and posology proposed for LysaKare is in turn based on 
the extensive use of the “Rotterdam Protocol”, which seems therefore reasonable.  
The performed main trials did not report separate outcomes for different age groups, gender or tumour 
types.  
Overall, the literature data as provided describes the co-administration of 2.5% Lys-Arg solution, covers 
a sufficient number of patients and are conclusive and coherent with respect to the intended indication. 
The  total  body  of  evidence  that  emerges  upon  assessment  leads  to  The  efficacy  of  an  2.5%  Lys-Arg 
solution in the proposed indication has been adequately proven, e.g. in Brabander (2017), in which only 
0.3 % of subjects suffered creatinine grade 3 /4 toxicities, and serum creatinine levels normalized in all 
patients by 3 months after treatment completion. 
In only one study (Kwekkeboom 2001), the effect of amino acid infusion vs. no infusion was evaluated on 
renal radiation-uptake in the kidneys in patients receiving 177Lu- DOTATATE. The doses to the kidneys 
were  reduced  by  a  mean  of  47%  (range  34-59%)  when  the  2.5%  Lys-Arg  solution  was  co-infused. 
However, the reliability of the study is may be seen critical since the number of trial participants was small 
(n=5), although all of them had the AA-solution administered at the second 177Lu- DOTATATE treatment. 
Age distribution was unknown, and no formal statistics on the observed differences has been presented. 
Based  on  the  published  clinical  studies  discussed  it  was  also  shown  that  the  reduction  of  the  renally 
absorbed radiation dose can increase the theoretical maximum allowed dose for PRRT, which could be 
reasonably expected to increase the efficacy of the PRRT. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  2.5%  Lys-Arg  solution  for  the  reduction  of  renal  radiation  exposure  during 
Peptide-Receptor  Radionuclide  Therapy  (PRRT)  with  177Lu-oxodotreotide  has  been  adequately 
documented.  The  cited  publications  indicate  that  radiation  doses  to  the  kidneys  can  be  significantly 
reduced  when amino  acid  solutions  are  co-infused  (reduction  of  renal  radiation  uptake).  They  further 
illustrate that the reduction of renal uptake enables higher radiation doses which is a direct benefit for 
patients. 
The exact LysaKare formulation has not been tested in combination with 177Lu-DOTATATE in any of the 
presented  studies.  However,  different  compositions  of  AA-solutions  have  a  generally  similar  effect  on 
renal reabsorption of RSAs, which supports efficacy of the LysaKare formulation in the indication applied 
for.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety information for 2.5% Lys-Arg and other amino acid formulations from a total of 28 publications 
reporting data on reduction of renal absorbed radiation dose during RSA treatment are included in this 
summary supporting LysaKare. 
There  has  been  extensive  experience  with  2.5%  Lys-Arg  and  other  amino  acid  formulations  for  the 
reduction of renal radiation exposure during RSA as summarized in the table below: 
Table 6.  Summary of Exposure with Safety Data for 2.5% Lys-Arg Using the “Rotterdam Protocol” 
†Series of reports associated with a large 1,214 patient Phase I/II clinical study at Erasmus Medical Center in which all 
patients received 2.5% Lys-Arg for the reduction of renal radiation exposure; safety analysis was conducted on 610 
patients 
*Reports from same medical center with potentially overlapping patient populations 
Briefly, the safety information for 2.5% Lys-Arg is based on 12 literature reports of studies involving over 
900  patients  receiving  more  than  2500  doses  of  2.5%  Lys-Arg  during  RSA  with  various  radiolabelled 
somatostatin analogues (RSAs) and up to 3 years of follow-up data. The majority of patients received 3-4 
doses of 2.5% Lys-Arg administered 6-14 weeks apart (administered concomitantly with RSA). This is 
likely an underestimate of the overall population exposed to 2.5% Lys-Arg as the Kwekkeboom 2008 and 
related publications only report on a subgroup of patients treated in the 1,214 patient Phase I/II Erasmus 
Medical Center study in which all patients received 2.5% Lys-Arg. 
Additional supportive data is drawn from literature reports of other amino acid formulations, experience 
with  which  includes  treatment  of  2409  patients  receiving  a  total  of  approximately  6959  amino  acid 
co-infusions with various RSAs. Follow-up data out to 13 years is available. The majority of these patients 
received 2 doses of amino acids, with range being 1-10 doses. Dosing intervals generally mimic those 
commonly used for RSA treatment (6-14 week intervals).  
The patient populations included in the provided studies were diverse comprising patients with varying 
stages of disease of different origins, ages, previous/concomitant treatments, including other radioactive 
therapies or types of chemotherapy, and co-morbidities. Further, the inclusion / exclusion criteria varied 
between  the  studies,  as  some  only  required  a  diagnosis  of  NET,  other  studies  had  criteria  based  on 
creatinine  clearance,  s-creatinine  levels,  or  baseline  GFR.  The  applicant  has  adequately  provided  the 
requested  summary  of  the  demographics  of  patients  included  in  the  studies,  which  used  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/363968/2019  
Page 42/62 
 
 
 
 
25-Arg/25-Lys infusion. There are no marked differences in the demographics in these studies to be taken 
into account in the evaluation of the safety profiles of the respective studies. 
Adverse events 
Based on the above criteria, the following events were determined to be relevant to amino acid solutions 
containing  the  same  amino  acid  content  and  using  the  same  infusion  protocol  as  that  proposed  for 
LysaKare:  
Very common Events (≥ 10% of subjects): Nausea, Vomiting 
Individual reports: Hyperkalemia, Headache, Dizziness, Flushing, Abdominal pain 
The  events  are  reversible,  and  have  been  reported  at  rates  up  to  70%  (nausea  in  the  presence  of 
anti-emetics). 
Studies  with  amino  acid  formulations  and  infusion  protocols  other  than  2.5%  Lys-Arg  were  also 
considered, as they are considered anyway to provide supportive data to LysaKare safety assessment. 
Data from three controlled studies show differential safety profiles for the different parameters tested. 
These  studies  indicate  that  limiting  infusion  volume  and  overall  amino  acid load  reduce  the  incidence 
and/or severity of nausea, vomiting, and hyperkalaemia. Other adverse events reported in these studies 
were deemed not related to amino acid infusion. For example, hypophosphatemia was reported in one of 
the studies using a formulation of mixed amino acids, but this was not supported by two other studies. 
Hyperkalemia  
Transient, sometimes severe (>6 mmol/L) hyperkalemia was associated with 2.5% Lys-Arg and other 
amino  acid  formulations  in  a  number  of  publications.  Generally,  serum  potassium  levels  returned  to 
baseline within 24 hours. Transient hyperkalemia itself (increases < 6mmol/l) seems to be quite common, 
with the incidence of severe hyperkalemia affecting a lesser proportion.  
Lapa et al (2014a and b) published results from a prospective, cross-over study evaluating the tolerability 
of two different combinations of L-Lysine HCl and L-Arginine HCl conducted in 22 patients (13 male, 9 
female) aged 31-82 years. Clinical symptoms and biochemical changes were monitored through 24 h post 
RSA treatment. 
Dose 1 consisted of a 75 g amino acid dose (37.5 g each L-Lysine HCl and L-Arginine HCl in 1500 mL 0.9% 
NaCl) administered as a 4 h infusion (375 ml/h) starting 0.5 to 1 hour prior to treatment with 7.5 ± 0.7 
GBq of 177Lu-Dotatate. 
Dose 2 was administered at an unspecified interval after Dose 1 and involved a 50 g amino acid dose (25 
g each L-Lysine HCl and L-Arginine HCl in 2000 mL 0.9% NaCl) administered as a 4 h infusion (500 mL/h) 
starting 0.5 to 1 hour prior to treatment with 7.6 ± 0.3 GBq 177Lu-edotreotide. 
Hyperkalaemia  was  reported  to  a  similar  degree  following  both  amino  acid  formulations.  Three  of  22 
patients in the 75 g group presented with palpitations, chest pain and/or general discomfort. Evaluation 
of ECG revealed flattened P waves and high peaked T waves. Two of these three patients also became 
symptomatic  after  the  50  g  AA  dose.  These  observations  at  ECG  level  were  not  associated  with  any 
change in cardiac conduction times. All remaining patients tolerated the treatment without discomfort. In 
all symptomatic cases, serum potassium levels were ≥6.1 mmol/l with peak values of 7.9 mmol/l and 
required prompt intervention by infusion of 20 IU insulin with 20% glucose in 500 mL saline. 
Elevations in serum K+ levels were common with both AA formulations. At baseline, mean K+ levels were 
4.4 ± 0.4 mmol/l (75g) and 4.3 ± 0.4 mmol/l (50g), respectively. At 4 h, 20/22 subjects (91%) in both 
groups had serum potassium levels ≥ 5.0 mmol/l with a mean of 5.8 ± 0.7 mmol/l (75g) and 5.7 ± 0.8 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/363968/2019  
Page 43/62 
 
 
 
mmol/l (50 g), respectively. Increases in K+ levels were comparable (25% for 75 g, p<0.001 and 24% for 
50 g AA p<0.001). 
In both groups, severe hyperkalaemia defined as K+ > 6 mmol/l was observed in 8/22 (36%) patients. 
After 24h, K+ levels almost returned to baseline (mean, 4.5 ± 0.4 mmol/l (75g AA) vs mean 4.6 ± 0.4 
mmol/l (50 g AA). No significant differences between both AA protocols were found at any time point. 
At 4 h post-infusion, all other parameters investigated showed only minor differences. Only glomerular 
filtration rates (p = 0.011 and creatinine levels at 24 h (p = 0.016) varied significantly between the 50 g 
AA and 75 g AA doses at 24 h post-infusion. 
In  a  response  the  applicant  clarified  that  in  more  than  3500  patients  treated  with  Lutathera  to  date 
(including  1214  patients  in  Erasmus  MC,  112  patients  in  NETTER-1,  and  2511  patients  in  the 
Compassionate  Use  programs)  equaling  approximately  9000  co-administrations  of  AA  solution  and 
Lutathera (including administrations of LysaKare in France and the UK since September 2017), 11 cases 
were identified using the SMQ “Cardiac arrhythmias”. Of these 11 cases, five were reported from clinical 
studies, four were from named patient use and the remaining two were spontaneous. None of these cases 
had a fatal outcome.  
Nine  cases  included  events  such  as  “Atrial  fibrillation  (4),  electrocardiogram  QT  prolonged, 
atrioventricular  block  II  degree,  cardiac  failure,  electrocardiogram  repolarization  abnormality,  bundle 
branch  block  right”.  There  were  confounding  factors  in  six  of  these  cases  (previous  cardiac  history, 
concomitant  medications  and  absence  of  important  laboratory  investigation  results  -  particularly 
potassium) and the remaining three cases provided little information.  
The remaining two cases reported hyperkalemia. The first case was about a 55-year-old female patient, 
who,  at  the  end  of  her  third  Lutathera  cycle,  reported  weakness  and  was  unable  to  walk.  Laboratory 
results revealed a serum potassium of 7.9 mmol/L leading to hospitalization. No ECG abnormalities were 
reported. On the next day, the patient was discharged with serum potassium of 4.3 mmol/L. No treatment 
details  were  provided.  The  second  case  was  about  a  70-year-old  patient  who  received  her  fourth 
Lutathera  cycle.  Baseline  serum  potassium  was  4.7  mmol/L.  Creatinine  clearance  was  50  mL/min.  At 
around 2.30 pm (approximately at the end of the treatment infusion), serum potassium was 6.1 mmol/L, 
and  at  5.30  pm  it  was  5.6  mmol/L.  No  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  were  reported.  The  ECG  was 
unremarkable. Treatment included one spoon full of sodium polystyrene sulfonate; One day later, serum 
potassium was at 4.1 mmol/L In both the above cases, the composition of the amino acids was unknown 
despite multiple follow up attempts by the applicant. However, on a very recent follow-up (16-Jan-2019), 
the amino acid infused for the patient in the second case was clarified as LysaKare. No ECG abnormalities 
pertaining to cardiac conduction time were seen. 
Phlebitis  
Phlebitis  and  infusion  site  reactions  were  not  reported  in  any  of  the  publications  considered  in  the 
evaluation  of  literature  relevant  for  LysaKare  safety,  including  studies  infusing  large  volumes  of 
commercial amino acid solutions with pH similar to that of LysaKare (e.g. Vamin 18, AminoSyn II 10%). 
Other adverse events  
Other adverse events described in the literature reports were considered to be either related to the RSA 
(e.g., hematological toxicities, hair loss) or related to the patient’s underlying disease (e.g., abdominal 
pain  due  to  tumors,  flushing  due  to  tumor  lysis  syndrome,  liver  toxicities  in  the  presence  of  liver 
metastases).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The Supplementary Material of the phase III, key study by Strosberg (2017a) reported two SAEs to be 
related to the amino acid infusions by the investigator: 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory  data  apart  from  the  information  on  hyperkalaemia  have  not  been  presented  with  the 
application.  
Safety in special populations 
Use of amino acids for reducing the renal absorbed radiation dose during RSA therapy may be limited by 
either restrictions related to the amino acid co-infusion or the RSA itself.  
Renal Impairment 
There have been no studies addressing efficacy and safety of amino acid co-infusions in patients with 
renal insufficiency. In the case of Lutathera, treatment has been contraindicated in patients with severe 
renal impairment (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Lutathera dose can be modified for patients with less severe 
renal impairment. Even in cases where Lutathera dose is reduced, the full infusion of LysaKare is still 
recommended. 
Hepatic Impairment 
There have been no studies addressing the safety and efficacy of 2.5% Lys-Arg in hepatic insufficiency. 
The prescribing information for complex amino solutions used for parenteral nutrition purposes include 
warnings stating that the use of amino-acid solutions in patients with hepatic impairment may result in 
plasma  amino  acid  imbalances,  hyperammonemia,  pre-renal  azotemia,  stupor,  and  coma.  The  total 
amino acid dose associated with these parenteral formulations includes much larger amounts of amino 
acids and greater infusion volumes than LysaKare. In the 28 publications containing safety information 
supporting  the  use  of  amino  acids  and  the  2.5%  Lys-Arg  formulation  in  PRRT  the  reduction  of  renal 
radiation exposure, liver toxicities were only reported for 3 patients, none of which progressed to hepatic 
failure.  All  3  events  were  attributed  to  liver  metastases  rather  than  the  amino  acid  treatment  itself. 
However,  a  serious  adverse  event  of  hepatic  encephalopathy  in  one  patient  warranted  further 
clarification. In the response, it was clarified that this patient was hospitalized for bilirubin increase before 
the first dose due to a cholangitis because of a potential stent dysfunction. 
As stated in the warning (4.4) section of the current SmPC for Lutathera, it is not recommended to start 
a treatment with Lutathera is in patients Liver impairment with either total bilirubinaemia > 3 times the 
upper limit of normal or albuminuria < 30 g/L and prothrombin ratio decreased < 70%. Section 4.2 of the

impairment  is  required  since  an  increased  radiation  exposure  is  possible  in  these  patients.  The 
pharmacokinetic profile of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide in patients with severe hepatic impairment has 
not been studied, therefore treatment with Lutathera in those patients is not recommended.” 
Thus, in this circumstance, the limitations associated with the RSA would limit use of LysaKare in patients 
with  either  total  bilirubinaemia  >  3  times  the  upper  limit  of  normal  or  albuminuria  <  30  g/dL  and 
prothrombin decreased < 70%. 
Cardiac Insufficiency 
There have been no studies addressing the safety and efficacy of 2.5% Lys-Arg in patients with cardiac 
insufficiency.  
Elderly 
The  safety  and  effectiveness  of  2.5%  Lys-Arg  (or  amino  acids  in  general)  for  the  reduction  of  renal 
radiation exposure during RSA treatment have not been established in elderly patients, although they 
were well represented in the clinical studies considered for the LysaKare application. 
Pediatrics 
The safety and efficacy of 2.5% Lys-Arg (or amino acids in general) for the reduction of renal radiation 
exposure during RSA treatment have  not been established in patients under 18 years of age and the 
safety profile of paediatric populations of different ages is not known.  
Other Populations at Potential Risk 
LysaKare is intended to be used in association with Lutathera and therefore it is subjected to the same 
restrictions. No specific populations at potential risk, other than those indicated in the Lutathera EU SmPC, 
are identified for LysaKare use. 
Immunological events 
No immunological events were reported. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant stated that there are no known drug interactions of concern. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations have not been systematically captured in most of the provided studies for the infusion 
solutions due to the retrospective nature of these studies. Therefore, it seems not possible to assess the 
discontinuation  rate  related  due  to  AES  caused  by  the  applied  product.  From  the  Lutathera  trials, 
discontinuation  due  to  AES  was  7  patients  in  the  NETTER-1  study,  which  was  lower  than  in  the 
Sandostatin LAR arm. 
Post marketing experience 
All safety data reported above is post marketing. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety information for 2.5% Lys-Arg and other amino acid formulations from a total of 28 publications 
have been included in the applicant’s summary to support the safety of LysaKare. These studies include 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/363968/2019  
Page 46/62 
 
 
 
reports of clinical use of the 2.5% Lys-Arg formulation (Erasmus MC) administered to reduce the kidney 
absorbed  radiation  dose  during  RSA  treatment  dating  back  to  2001.  Altogether,  the  applicant  has 
gathered data on reported clinical experience in over 1200 patients receiving 2.5% Lys-Arg using the 
infusion regimen proposed for LysaKare (the “Rotterdam Protocol” applied in the Erasmus  MC study). 
Available data include up to 70 months of follow-up.  
Additional supportive data is drawn from other clinical studies using other amino acid formulations and 
slightly  different  infusion  protocols.  Moreover,  the  clinical  experience of  renal protection  in  PRRT  with 
RSAs other than 177Lu-DOTATATE is considered relevant to support the safe and effective use of LysaKare 
during PRRT with Lutathera, as the different RSAs share the same mechanism of renal uptake. 
The  safety  profile  of  2.5%  Lys-Arg  is  not  easy  to  characterize,  as  the  amino  acid  solution  is 
co-administered with RSAs and therefore the cause of safety events may be difficult to discern. Evaluation 
is further confounded with the wide clinical adoption of anti-emetic pre-treatment, due to the nausea and 
vomiting associated with the amino acid infusions. For the purposes of this dossier, the safety events that 
are  considered  related  to  lysine  and  arginine  were  those  with  a  close  temporal  association  with  the 
infusion itself. The assessment is based on a qualitative evaluation of incidence and severity of events 
occurring  during  or  soon  after  infusion.  Observation  of  the  same  events  in  multiple  studies  (and  at 
different clinical centres) provides confidence in the strength of association between the events and the 
treatment regimen. The approach of choosing adverse events with a narrow timely relationship to the 
amino acid infusion is restrictive, but responses with a thorough review of all adverse events registered in 
the  publications  revealed  that  adverse  events  most  likely  related  to  the  amino  acid  infusion  occurred 
during this interval. 
The presented studies that have employed a solution of lysine and arginine in the same quantities as 
proposed in LysaKare in combination with 177Lu-dotatate are single-arm, mainly retrospective studies and 
information on adverse events has not been systematically generated or collected. The safety information 
in these studies generally consists of laboratory tests, such as blood counts and assessment of liver and 
kidney  function,  which  in  some  studies  are  further  specified  as  s-creatinine  and  s-ALT,  s-AST.  Some 
studies have also measured GFR or assessed absorbed dose of radioactivity. Only 116 patients have been 
exposed to a Lys-arg solution in a randomised controlled trial (Strosberg 2017a). However, in this study, 
lysine and arginine were not administered in the same quantities as proposed in LysaKare. 
Nausea and vomiting have been determined to occur in ≥ 10% of subjects and have be stated to be “very 
common”;  hyperkalaemia,  abdominal  pain,  flushing,  headache,  dizziness  occur  with  “unknown” 
frequency. The frequency category of “hyperkalaemia” will be clarified in below mentioned PASS. 
“Pre-existing clinically significant hyperkalaemia if not adequately corrected before starting the LysaKare 
infusion” has been included in section 4.3 of the SmPC as a contraindication. The applicant clarified the 
temporal relationship between the infusion of the amino acid solution and the hyperkalaemia (i.e. how 
fast the onset is and how long the duration is), the physiological mechanism behind the occurrence of 
hyperkalaemia, and the patient populations who may be at higher risk of developing hyperkalaemia, as 
follows. 
An  increase  of  serum  potassium  levels  may  occur  in  patients  receiving  arginine  and  lysine.  Serum 
potassium level increases are generally mild and transient. According to limited available data maximum 
levels should be reached approximatively by 4 to 5 hours after start of the infusion and should return to 
normal levels by 24 hours. Serum potassium levels must be tested before each treatment with LysaKare. 
In  case  of  hyperkalaemia,  patient’s  history  of  hyperkalaemia  and  concomitant  medication  should  be 
checked.  Hyperkalaemia  must  be  corrected  accordingly  before  starting  the  infusion.  In  case  of 
pre-existing  clinically  significant  hyperkalaemia,  a  second  monitoring  prior  to  LysaKare  infusion  must 
confirm  that  hyperkalaemia  has  been  successfully  corrected.  During  treatment  and  up  to  24  hours 
thereafter,  the  patient  should  be  monitored  closely  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  hyperkalaemia,  e.g. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/363968/2019  
Page 47/62 
 
 
 
dyspnoea, weakness, numbness, chest pain and cardiac manifestations (conduction abnormalities and 
cardiac arrhythmias). After the infusion an ECG should be performed prior to discharging the patient. Vital 
signs should be monitored during the infusion regardless of baseline serum potassium levels. Patients 
should be instructed to drink substantial quantities of water (at least 1 glass every hour) on the day of 
infusion to remain hydrated and facilitate excretion of excess serum potassium (SmPC section 4.4). 
A  PASS  investigating  systematically  the  hyperkalaemia  risk  with  LysaKare  and  confirming  the  safety 
profile documented in the literature will be conducted by the applicant.  
It  is  agreed  that,  except  for  hyperkalaemia,  most  of  the  adverse  events  described  in  the  scientific 
literature  to  be  directly  related  to  the  amino  acid  solution  are  of  mild  nature  and  transient.  This  is 
especially true for vomiting and nausea, being reported at rates up to 70%. Moreover, it needs to be 
considered that these symptoms may also be caused by the underlying tumour disease.  
Two serious adverse events have been reported in the randomised controlled trial by Strosberg (2017a); 
these were syncope and hepatic encephalopathy. Both events were reported to be related to the amino 
acid  solution  by  the  investigator,  but  evaluation  of  the  details  provided  in  the  response  document 
indicated rather a causal relation to underlying other diseases.  
Similarly,  the  reported  increases  of  hepatic  transaminases  in  a  small  part  of  the  patients  were  also 
mentioned in one of the retrospective studies (from the Rotterdam center) are more likely to reflect the 
hepatic  metastasis  from  the  treated  NET  tumours  than  a  drug  related  hepatotoxicity  of  LysaKare.  It 
should  be  kept  in  mind  that  the  patients,  whom  these  publications  concern,  are  severely  ill  due  to 
unresectable, often metastasised tumours.  
In general, it needs to be considered that due to the concomitant radioactive treatment blood sampling is 
technical difficult in this setting.  
Renal radiation absorbed dose appears to be inversely related to renal function, such that patients with 
renal impairment tend to have higher renal absorbed doses than patients with normal renal function. It is 
not known if this is reflective of decreased efficacy of amino acid co-infusion or other unknown effects. It 
is  possible  that  patients  with  reduced  renal  function  are  more  prone  to  develop  adverse  events,  e.g. 
hyperkalemia. Therefore, a special warning and a precaution has been included in the PI of LysaKare, and 
similar ones are already included in Lutathera’s PI. 
Patients with cardiac insufficiency are known to have problems with fluid overload by intravenous fluids. 
Thus,  large  volume  infusions  associated  with  commercial  parenteral  amino  acid  formulations  are  not 
recommended.  The  reduced  infusion  volume  offered  by  the  2.5%  Lys-Arg  formulation  makes  it  the 
recommended approach in treatment guidelines. Both the LysaKare and the Lutathera PI include special 
warnings and precautions regarding patients with severe heart failure defined as class III or IV in the New 
York  Heart  Association  classification:  “Due  to  potential  for  clinical  complications  related  to  volume 
overload care should be taken with use of arginine and lysine in patients with severe heart failure defined 
as class III or class IV in the NYHA classification. Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is not 
recommended  for  patients  with  severe  heart  failure  defined  as  class  III  or  class  IV  in  the  NYHA 
classification  therefore,  the  benefit  risk  for  these  patients  will  always  need  to  be  weighed  carefully.” 
(SmPC, section 4.4) 
Older  age  has  been  associated  with  declines  in  renal  function  of  ~1%  per  year  predisposing  this 
population to potentially higher renal radiation doses. However, in the studies considering risk factors for 
renal toxicities, age was not strong enough to influence clinical outcome on its own. Older patients may 
also possess other risk factors, which further increase the risk for elevated renal absorbed radiation dose. 
Thus, elderly patients receiving RSA and LysaKare should be carefully monitored.

It is acknowledged that data on co-infusion of LysaKare in special patient sub-populations is limited by the 
lack of direct experience (severe renal and severe hepatic impairment) and restrictions in the Lutathera 
product  information.  However,  there  are  special  warnings  and  precautions  in  the  Lysakare  PI  for  the 
subpopulations of patients with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, cardiac insufficiency and elderly, 
as well as in the Lutathera PI, which are adequate. 
Lysakare exerts its effect through the interaction with megaline/cubiline system by decreasing the uptake 
of positively charged molecules at the tubular level. Potentially, drugs that are re-absorbed by the same 
system could compete. However, no information was found about possible drugs being re-absorbed by 
this mechanism and thus it is agreed that no specific warning on drug-drug interactions is indicated. 
From the information provided is seems unlikely that the minor differences in the formulation of LysaKare 
would negatively influence the electrolyte balance and pH value to a higher and possibly unacceptable 
degree. 
As discussed before and described by Pfob (and also Giovacchini 2011, Lapa 2014a and Lapa 2014b), 
infusion of amino acid infusions is often associated with severe metabolic acidosis and the concurrent 
hyperkalaemia  are  potentially  harmful  or  even  lethal.  Pfob  et  al.  state  “even  if  to  date  no  serious 
cardiovascular events have been reported, the level of potassium reached with amino acid infusion is 
potentially harmful or even lethal and cannot be ignored, even if the elevation is transient.” This risk is 
addressed by a special warning in LysaKare’s EU SmPC. 
Immunological events are not expected, as L-Lysine and L-Arginine are naturally occurring amino acids. 
In the context of the underlying disease and the Lutathera adverse events discontinuation due to AES 
from Lysakare is very low. 
Given that the reported hypophosphataemia lacked the robustness to be seen in multiple studies, it was 
deemed not to be a relevant event associated with amino acid infusions. Serum potassium seems to be 
the only electrolyte consistently affected by amino acid infusions as no changes in serum sodium chloride, 
or in other serum electrolytes were observed. 
Phlebitis is a theoretical risk with amino acid infusion, but is not believed to represent a risk for LysaKare. 
Phlebitis at the site of injection has been attributed to hyperosmolarity of the infused amino acid solution 
which could be treated with local vasoprotective creams. LysaKare was formulated to have an osmolarity 
much closer to physiologic levels than that of parenteral amino acid mixtures that have been used for 
reducing the kidney absorbed radiation dose during RSA treatment in relevant studies reported in the 
literature. 
The applicant states that modifying the LysaKare formulation compared to the 2.5% Lys-Arg formulation 
was to improve patient tolerance. The rationale of lowering the osmolality to a lower, more physiologic 
value seems plausible. However, removing NaOH for pH adjustment to bring the osmolality of LysaKare 
closer to the physiological one resulted in a lower pH value in comparison to the 2.5% Lys-Arg used in the 
Erasmus MC trial. Although the pH value of LysaKare is lower compared to that of the preparations used 
in the cited clinical studies, it was clarified with the applicant’s response that the maximum concentration 
of free [H+] in the LysaKare solution is about 0.008 mmol/L, equivalent to 0.008 mEq/L. This value is well 
below the blood buffering capacity which is, considering only the chemical buffers of plasma in whole 
blood, in the range of 24 - 38 mEq/L. Thus, this initial concern has been resolved.  
There are no data on the use of arginine and lysine in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient 
with  respect  to  reproductive  toxicity  (SmPC,  section  4.6).  There  is  no  relevant  use  of  this  medicinal 
product in women of childbearing potential since lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is contraindicated during 
established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded due to the risk associated 
with the ionizing radiation (SmPC, section 4.6).

Arginine and lysine, being naturally occurring amino acids, are excreted in human milk, but effects on the 
breastfed  newborns/infants  are  unlikely.  Breast-feeding  should  be  avoided  during  treatment  with 
lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide (SmPC, section 4.6). 
There  are  no  data  on  the  effects  of  arginine  and  lysine  on  fertility  (SmPC,  section  4.6),  which  is 
acceptable, given among others the fertility precaution of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide. 
Taking  into  account  that  (177Lu)  oxodotreotide  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  GEP-NETs,  which 
represent  a  rare  disease,  and  taking  into  account  the  overall  amount  of  experience  with  amino  acid 
solutions, the safety data base is deemed sufficient for this WEU application. From the safety database all 
the adverse reactions reported have been included in the PI.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The data presented allow characterization of the safety profile of LysaKare. A similar safety profile of the 
applied  product  compared  with  those  Arg-Lys  formulations  already  used  in  clinical  practice  can  be 
reasonably assumed. 
The  CHMP  considers  the  following  measures  necessary  to  address  issues  related  to  safety:  An 
international post-authorization safety study to assess the effect of LysaKare administration on potassium 
blood levels concentration up to 24h compared to baseline (category III).

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine 
the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  target  indication  is  as  follows:  ‘Reduction  of  renal  radiation  exposure  during  Peptide-Receptor 
Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide in adults’. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently,  there  are  no  commercial  amino  acid  formulations  that  have  been  approved  for  use  in  the 
reduction of renal radiation exposure during treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE or other RSAs.  
The LysaKare formulation is based on a 2.5% Lysine HCl + 2.5% Arginine HCl (2.5% Lys-Arg) amino acid 
solution  that  has  been  clinically  used  for  reducing  the  renal  radiation  exposure  during  RSA  treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/363968/2019  
Page 51/62 
 
 
 
since at least 2001, e.g. as part of the “Rotterdam Protocol” also used in the Erasmus MC study. Currently 
the  2.5%  Lys-Arg  amino  acid  solution  in  line  with  the  Rotterdam  Protocol  needs  to  be  prepared  as 
extemporaneous preparation in (hospital) pharmacies. 
It is noted that international guidelines as well as the SmPC for currently centrally approved (177Lu) 
oxodotreotide (Lutathera) request the simultaneous infusion of Lysine and Arginine in quantities 
corresponding to what is present in LysaKare. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Kwekkeboom  et  al  (2001)  reported  the  results  of  a  study  on  the  effect  of  amino  acid  infusion  vs.  no 
infusion in the same patient receiving 177Lu-DOTATATE (1850 MBq or 50 mCi).The amino acid solution 
was made of 2.5% L-Lysine HCl and 2.5% L-Arginine HCl in 1L of 0.225% NaCl (2.5% Lys-Arg). The 
infusion  was  given  over  4  hours  at  a  rate  of  250  ml/h,  beginning  30  minutes  prior  to  RSA  treatment 
(“Rotterdam Protocol”). 
The RSA doses to the kidneys were significantly reduced by a mean of 47% (range 34-59%) when the 
2.5% Lys-Arg solution was co-infused.  
Brabander et al. (2017) provided further follow-up information on 610 patients in the Erasmus MC phase 
I/II study who had received 177Lu- DOTA0Tyr3-octreotate between January 2000 to January 2015. The 
study focused on 610 patients residing in The Netherlands (‘Dutch’ patients) who had received at least 3.7 
GBq radiation dose. A median of 64 months follow-up data was available (range 58-70 months). 2.5% 
Lys-Arg  was  used  for  renal  protection.  In  this  report,  the  effectiveness  of  the  antitumor  effects  of 
177Lu-DOTATATE treatment continued to be supported, with median overall survival being 63 months, 
median progression free survival being 29 months and the median time to progression being 36 months. 
Moreover,  the  use  of  2.5%  Lys-Arg  solution  proved  to  be  effective  in  reducing  the  renal  radiation 
exposure, the mean kidney absorbed radiation dose being below the toxicity threshold. 
The effectiveness of amino-acids for renal protection during RSA treatment was shown in patients ranging 
from 11 to 91 years of age. The effectiveness of the 2.5% Lys-Arg formulation in particular and using the 
proposed dosing regimen was demonstrated in patients 17 to 89 years old. 
Both  males  and  females  were  represented  in  the  clinical  studies  with  approximately  40%  to  60% 
representation in most studies. Patients with various NETs in multiple stages were represented across 
study populations. Tumor load was also considered.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the benefit-risk balance (see 
section 3.7. ). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The following key events were determined to be relevant to amino acid solutions containing the same 
amino acid content and using the same infusion protocol as that proposed for LysaKare:  
Very common events (≥ 10% of subjects): Nausea, Vomiting 
The  events  are  reversible  during  24  h  after  start  of  infusion  and  are  most  pronounced  at  the  end  of 
infusion (after 4 hours). Up to 70% of subjects reported nausea. 
Assessment report

Not reported in all studies: Hyperkalemia 
Transient, sometimes severe (>6 mmol/L) serum hyperkalemia was associated with 2.5% Lys-Arg and 
other amino acid formulations in a number of publications. Generally, serum potassium levels returned to 
baseline within 24 hours. Mild hyperkalemia (< 6mmol/l) was reported in up to 91 % of subjects, severe 
hyperkalemia (> 6mmol/l) in up to 36 % of subjects. Severe cases presented with palpitations, chest pain 
and/or general discomfort. Evaluation of ECG revealed flattened P waves and high peaked T waves. These 
observations at ECG level were not associated with any change in cardiac conduction times. A maximum 
of 7.9 mmol/l was reported. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  exact  incidence,  severity,  duration,  reversibility,  dose-response  relationship  of  hyperkalaemia  is 
unknown. Likewise, the frequencies of withdrawals and treatments given to correct the hyperkalaemia 
are unknown. 
The included studies are, with a few exceptions, retrospective with a lack of systematically generated and 
collected  safety  data.  The  only  phase  III  randomised  controlled  trial  used  amino  acid  infusions  in  a 
different concentration of that proposed in LysaKare. These methodological shortcomings hampered the 
evaluation of LysaKare’s safety profile in general. Additionally, the product is used during PRRT with 177Lu 
oxodotreotide,  which  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  GEP-NETs,  a  rare  disease  entity.  The  limited 
number  of  patients  makes  assessment  of  differences  in  safety  events  in  subgroups  rather  difficult, 
particularly, as this product is used in a target population suffering from a severe malignancy.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Published  studies  demonstrate  that  2.5%  Arg-Lys  solutions  reduce  renal  radiation  exposure  by  47% 
(range  34%  to  59%).  This  effect  is  considered  of  clinical  importance.  Thus,  reduction  of  radiation 
exposure  is  very  likely  to  reduce  the  risk  of  acute  and  chronic  radiation  damage  to  the  kidneys. 
Furthermore,  as  the  kidneys  are  the  dose  limiting  organ  for  this  type  of  therapy,  reduction  of  renal 
radiation exposure is also considered important in order to allow adequate dosing of the RSAs to increase 
the likelihood of a clinically relevant oncological effect of this treatment. Concomitant administration of AA 
solutions reduces RSA-induced acute and chronic kidney damage and facilitates adequate RSAs exposure 
to increase likelihood of a favourable oncological result. Both can be considered relevant beneficial effects 
for patients. The data allow extrapolation of efficacy data from the solutions used in the published studies 
to  the  product  applied  for.  It  can  be  assumed  that  LysaKare  has  the  same  efficacy  in  the  intended

indication. The limitations regarding number of patients, design, completeness of data, and analysis are 
acceptable. 
The  safety  data  presented  indicates  that  infusion  of  amino  acid  solutions  is  associated  with 
hyperkalaemia,  nausea  and  vomiting.  As  regards  hyperkalaemia,  this  condition  is  potentially 
life-threatening if unrecognized and/or untreated and as such clinically important. On the other hand, if 
predicted/recognized and treated adequately, hyperkalaemia can be managed. Potassium levels in blood 
increase  during  the  4  hours  of  amino  acid  infusion  and  are  at  highest  at  the  end  of  this  period. 
Normalisation  to  baseline  levels  was  observed  during  the  next  24  hours.  Specific  risk  factors  for 
developing hyperkalaemia were not identified, but clearly other clinical situations promoting development 
of hyperkalaemia like metabolic acidosis (which has been observed with complex AA solutions) or renal 
impairment  have  to  be  considered  as  risk  factors.  Therefore,  a  respective  contraindication,  special 
precautions and warnings have been implemented in the PI in order to allow an adequate control of this 
identified risk. A PASS investigating systematically the hyperkalaemia risk with LysaKare and confirming 
the  safety  profile  documented  in  the  literature  will  be  conducted  by  the  applicant.  The  limitations  of 
retrospective data collection and lack of control arm with respect to the risks of nausea and vomiting are 
acceptable. 
Given that the product is intended for the use in patients with a rare condition, a full evaluation of the 
efficacy and safety across different populations, e.g. age, gender, concomitant diseases was not possible 
due to the limited population available. There are special warnings and precautions in the Lysakare PI for 
the  subpopulations  of  patients  with  renal  impairment,  hepatic  impairment,  cardiac  insufficiency  and 
elderly, which are expected to sufficiently control the potential risks in these patients.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  well-established  use  of  Arg-Lys  solutions  for  the  reduction  of  renal  radiation  exposure  during 
Peptide-Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide has been adequately 
documented. The cited publications indicate that doses to the kidneys can be significantly reduced when 
a 2.5% Arg-Lys solution are co-infused (reduction of renal radiation uptake). Concomitant administration 
of  2.5%  Arg-Lys  solutions  reduces  RSA-induced  acute  and  chronic  kidney  damage  and  facilitates 
adequate RSA exposure to increase likelihood of a favourable oncological result. Both can be considered 
relevant beneficial effects for patients. 
The main risk of LysaKare is severe hyperkalaemia. The respective contraindication, special warning and 
precaution are expected to control it adequately. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of LysaKare is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of LysaKare is favourable in the following indication: 
LysaKare is indicated for reduction of renal radiation exposure during peptide-receptor radionuclide 
therapy (PRRT) with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide in adults.

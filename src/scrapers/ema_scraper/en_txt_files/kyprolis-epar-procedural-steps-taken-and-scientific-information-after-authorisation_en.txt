Cardiac failure is an important risk associated to 
a warning of the increased risk of cardiac failure in 
carfilzomib, which is already described in the SmPC.  During 
Asian patients treated with carfilzomib based on 
postmarketing experience and three phase 3 
randomized-controlled studies (CLARION-Study 
2011-003; ENDEAVOR-Study  20130398 and 
A.R.R.O.W.-Study  20140355). In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
an analysis subgroup of study CLARION,  a signal of a 
higher incidence of cardiac failure was identified in Chinese 
patients treated with carfilzomib compared to the overall 
study population. As a result of the signal, a review of the 
frequency of cardiac failure reported in carfilzomib clinical 
trials was performed. A trend towards a higher incidence of

cardiac failure in Asian subjects treated with carfilzomib 
was reported compared to non-Asian subjects in the 
ENDEAVOR,  CLARION  and ARROW  clinical trials. Thus, the 
exisiting warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC  is updated to 
reflect that the risk of cardiac failure is also increased in 
Asian patients.

A pre-planned overall survival (OS) analysis was performed 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
after 246 deaths in the Kyprolis, lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone (KRd) arm and 267 deaths in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) arm. The median 
follow-up was approximately 67 months. A statistically 
significant advantage in OS was observed in patients in the 
KRd arm compared to patients in the Rd arm. Patients in 
the KRd arm had a 21% reduction in the risk of death 
compared with those in the Rd arm (HR = 0.79; 95% CI: 
0.67, 0.95; p value = 0.0045). The median OS improved 
by 7.9 months in patients in the KRd arm compared with 
those in the Rd arm (see sections 5.1 of the SmPC  for 
further details).

and provide a statistically significant and clinically relevant 
result. The study thus met the objective for OS,  and 
therefore the ENDEAVOR  Overall Survival 2nd interim 
analysis CSR  (53.4% data maturity) is considered the final 
OS analysis. Section 5.1 of SmPC  has been updated to 
reflect this analysis of OS (2nd IA).  Results in terms of the 
secondary endpoint of peripheral neuropathy (incidence of 
grade 2 of higher peripheral neuropathy) continue showing 
a clinically relevant reduction of events.  
Regarding safety, updated data confirm previous findings. 
The slightly higher rates of adverse events are consistent 
with the longer treatment exposure and no safety concerns 
have been identified. Section 4.4 is updated to reflect that 
some of the acute renal failure events had been fatal. 
Changes regarding hypertension control prior to starting 
treatment and routinely evaluated while on carfilzomib 
were added in view of the number of hypertension adverse 
events reported. 
From the updated data available from ENDEAVOR  study 
and pooled safety data analysis, frequencies in the

tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 have been 
updated according to the new data available. Additionally, 
changes in line with the MedRA terms were made for some 
adverse reactions. Overall the summary of safety profile is 
updated to reflect that serious adverse reactions include: 
cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, 
myocardial ischaemia, interstitial lung disease, 
pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute 
respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, dyspnoea, 
hypertension including hypertensive crises, acute kidney 
injury, tumour lysis syndrome, infusion related reaction, 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage, 
pulmonary haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, hepatic 
failure, PRES,  thrombotic microangiopathy and TTP/HUS. In 
clinical studies with Kyprolis, cardiac toxicity and dyspnoea 
typically occurred early in the course of Kyprolis therapy. 
The most common adverse reactions (occurring in > 20% 
of subjects) were: anaemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, 
nausea, diarrhoea, pyrexia, dyspnoea, respiratory tract 
infection, cough and neutropenia. 
Overall the CHMP  considered acceptable to update the

Extension of Indication to include new indication for 
Kyprolis to be used with either lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone for the 
treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma 
who have received at least one prior therapy. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 
of the SmPC  are updated. The Package Leaflet and

the RMP (version 6.0) is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) updated section 6.6 of the SmPC  to include 
the option to administer Kyprolis in a 100 mL 
intravenous bag containing 5% glucose solution for 
injection in line with the extension of indication part 
of this variation.  
Furthermore the MAH took the opportunity to include 
some editorial changes and harmonisations in the PI 
and to update the information of local 
representatives for Croatia and Cyprus.

patients treated with Kyprolis, often associated with 
thrombocytopenia. Some of these events have been fatal. 
Cases of venous thromboembolic events, including deep 
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with fatal 
outcomes, have been reported in patients who received 
Kyprolis. 
Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism – 
including prior thrombosis – should be closely monitored.  
Action should be taken to try to minimisze all modifiable 
risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension and

concomitant administration of other agents that may 
increase the risk of thrombosis (e.g. erythropoietic agents 
or hormone replacement therapy). Patients and physicians 
are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of 
thromboembolism. Patients should be instructed to seek 
medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness 
of breath, chest pain, haemoptysis, arm or leg swelling or 
pain. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered based on 
an individual benefit/risk assessment.

In vitro, carfilzomib inhibits OATP1B1 with an IC50  = 2.01 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC  in order to update 
information on the potential for carfilzomib to inhibit 
UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 based on study 121863. In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
submitted two other in-vitro drug-drug interaction 
(DDI)  studies (121856 and 121939) on major 
metabolites M14, M15 and M16 to address their 
inhibitory and induction effects on CYP.  Furthermore 
the MAH took the occasion to introduce an editorial 
change to section 4.5 of the SmPC.

whereas it is unknown whether carfilzomib may or not 
inhibit other transporters OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 and 
BSEP,  at the systemic level. Carfilzomib does not inhibit 
human UGT2B7 but inhibits human UGT1A1 with an IC50  of 
5.5 μM. Nonetheless, considering the fast elimination of 
carfilzomib, notably a rapid decline in systemic 
concentration 5 minutes after the end of infusion, the risk 
of clinically relevant interactions with substrates of 
OATP1B1  and UGT1A1 is probably low.

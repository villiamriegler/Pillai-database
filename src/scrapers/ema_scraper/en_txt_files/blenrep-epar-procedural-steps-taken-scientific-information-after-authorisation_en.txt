the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this

sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the

Section 4.4: Warning on Pneumonitis is added: 
PL 
Cases of pneumonitis from spontaneous reports and named 
patient programs, including fatal events, have been 
observed with BLENREP although a causal association has 
not been established. Evaluation of patients with new or 
worsening unexplained pulmonary symptoms (e.g. cough, 
dyspnea) should be performed to exclude possible 
pneumonitis. In case of suspected Grade 3 or higher 
pneumonitis, BLENREP should be withheld. If Grade 3 or 
higher pneumonitis is confirmed, appropriate treatment 
should be initiated. BLENREP should only be resumed after 
an evaluation of the benefit and risk.

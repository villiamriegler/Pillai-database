This application is for an extension of indication of Kalydeco to include treatment of CF in children aged 4 
to less than 6 months who have an R117H mutation or one of the currently approved gating mutations in 
the CFTR gene for Kalydeco 25 mg granules. To support this application, results of the third interim 
analysis of study 124 were submitted. The first and second interim analysis reports were submitted and 
assessed in variations II/69 (for the extension of indication to children aged 12 to less than 24 months) 
and X/75/G (for the extension of indication to children aged 6 to less than 12 months). Study 124 is 
included in the IVA paediatric investigation plan (PIP) in the EU. The PDCO agreed that the open-label 
roll-over study 126 would be captured in the Kalydeco Risk Management Plan (RMP). The MAH received 
scientific advice from the CHMP on the development plan in patients < 6 years of age.  
The underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a loss of CFTR function that arises from a mutation in the 
gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, has adverse effects that can 
be observed in newborns and continue to progress through adulthood. The CFTR protein is an epithelial 
chloride channel that aids in regulating salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues. This 
function is defective in patients with CF due to a loss of cell surface expression and/or function of CFTR 
protein. The failure of mutated CFTR protein to regulate chloride transport results in the multisystem 
pathology associated with CF.

Since the introduction and continued advances of newborn and antenatal screening, many patients with 
CF are identified through a positive screening test and subsequently diagnosed within the first year of life. 
Approximately 63% of patients with CF in the EU and 75% of patients with CF in the UK are diagnosed by 
1 year of age. In the US, more than 80% of patients with CF are diagnosed by 2 years of age. CF affects 
the paediatric population, as approximately half of the total CF patient population in the US, EU, and 
Australia and approximately 40% in Canada are less than 18 years of age. 
Even before the widespread adoption of newborn screening, the majority of patients with CF were 
diagnosed in infancy or early childhood due to manifestations of the disease. In patients with severe 
genotypes (with gating mutations such as G551D), pancreatic destruction leading to pancreatic exocrine 
insufficiency begins in utero, and lung involvement, manifested by pulmonary inflammation and infection, 
begins shortly after birth. Loss of lung function is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients 
with CF. Infants with CF as young as 1 month show the presence of lung disease. High-resolution 
computed tomography studies of infants with CF who were diagnosed by newborn screening but 
considered clinically healthy showed that structural lung damage is common even very early in disease 
progression. In a cohort of 81 well-treated patients with CF in Australia, by the age of 3 years, 10% had 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and 84% had evidence of bronchiectasis This is consistent with results 
of inflammatory marker studies that found that airway inflammation begins in infancy. Airway 
inflammation signals the beginning of the destructive cycles of chronic inflammation, infection, and 
irreversible lung damage that are characteristic of CF lung disease. 
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and poor nutritional status are among the most significant clinical 
manifestations of CF in infants. These factors often lead to poor growth with subsequent growth delay, 
poorer cognitive development, and are associated with other clinical comorbidities such as decreased lung 
function and decreased survival. Malnourishment is associated with worsening lung function in children 
with CF and is an independent predictor of mortality in this population. In one study, fat malabsorption 
was present in 79% of infants tested at 6 months and 92% of infants by 12 months of age. Additionally, 
increased energy expenditure and appetite suppression due to lung disease contribute to poor somatic 
growth and poor nutritional status in young patients with CF. 
Data in the literature suggest that early therapeutic intervention is beneficial to young children with CF; 
studies have demonstrated benefits such as improved measures of growth, nutrition, and lung disease 
through early intervention in children diagnosed by newborn screening. 
Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA) targets the underlying mechanisms of disease, thus treatment with IVA at a 
young age could delay or even prevent the onset of clinical manifestations of CF such as CF lung disease 
and impaired exocrine pancreatic function. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, apart from the Environmental Risk 
Assessment data, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ivacaftor ERA (VX-770: Kalydeco Monotherapy and in Combination with VX-809 or VX-661 or 
VX-445 and VX-661 Environmental Phase I and Phase II Risk Assessment Report, Amendment 01) was 
provided in Module 1.6.1 in procedure EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0082 which is resumed in the following table. 
The prevalence data were for the total patient population, irrespective of age. Thus, the applied extension 
of indication in the 4 to 6 months age group is not considered to have an increase in environmental 
exposure to ivacaftor.

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in the application, apart from the studies of updated ERA 
which was recently assessed in variation II/82 (extension of indication). This is accepted by CHMP.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The data submitted in the non-clinical part of the dossier are acceptable for this type of application. The 
updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure 
further to the use of ivacaftor. Considering the above data, ivacaftor is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The third interim analysis of Cohorts 3 and 7 data from study 124 are submitted to support this 
application including patients from 3 months to less than 6 months. Of note, interim analysis report 1 and 
2 were submitted and assessed in variations II/69 (Extension of Indication, children age 12 to less than 
24 months) and X/75G (extension, children aged 6 to less 12 months), respectively. 
There is potential for patients with CF <6 months of age to benefit from IVA treatment based on evidence 
of unmet medical need and data showing a favourable benefit risk profile in older patient cohorts: 
• 
Evidence of efficacy in subjects ≥6 years of age with a G551D mutation (Studies 102, 103, and 
105) or a non-G551D mutation (Studies 111 and 112); 
•  Comparable PK and effects on sweat chloride (measure of CFTR function) in subjects 6 to <24 
months of age with a CFTR gating mutation (Study 124 Cohorts 5 and 6); subjects 2 through 5 
years of age with a CFTR gating mutation (Study 108); and subjects ≥6 years of age; 
• 
The well-characterized safety profile in subjects ≥6 months of age; 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 11/83 
 
 
  
  
 
• 
• 
Evidence of complications of CF starting very early in life, including impaired pancreatic exocrine 
function, lung inflammation and poor weight gain; and 
Evidence supporting the benefits of early therapeutic intervention. 
In the less than 6-month-old population, the rationale for IVA treatment is supported by the importance 
of slowing disease progression and the prevention of the negative consequences of CF such as 
compromised lung and pancreatic function and impaired nutritional status. It is expected that the primary 
benefit of IVA treatment in these younger CF subjects would derive from the potential to reduce the 
progression of disease before sustaining irreversible damage.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ivacaftor in the target age group of patients from 4 to <6 months of age 
was investigated in Study 124 which is an ongoing, two-part, open-label study, with part A assessing 
safety and PK and part B (24 weeks) assessing safety, PK, PD, and efficacy.  
For Part A/Cohort 3, subjects who were 3 to less than 6 months of age and weighed ≥5 kg at Day 1 (IVA 
treatment initiation) and had an R117H mutation or CFTR gating mutation on at least 1 allele were 
eligible for enrolment. Because one 3-month-old subject (25-mg IVA q12h [every 12 hours]) had an AUC 
value above the 95th percentile of that observed in the adult population, Part B/Cohort 7 was limited to 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 12/83 
 
 
  
  
 
subjects 4 to less than 6 months of age and weighing ≥5 kg at Day 1, with an R117H or CFTR gating 
mutation on at least 1 allele.  
Dose: IVA was supplied as granules packaged in a foil-laminated sachet/packet and was administered 
orally q12h at the doses summarized in Table 1 after mixing with approximately 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of 
appropriate liquid or soft food and administered with an age-appropriate fat-containing meal or snack. 
Sampling: The PK sampling schedule was as follows:  
Part A  
Day 4: pre-dose, between 2 and 4 hours, between 6 and 8 hours, and between 24 and 
60 hours after dosing 
Part B  
Week 2: pre-dose, between 2 and 4 hours, and between 6 and 8 hours after the morning 
dose 
Week 8: pre-dose, 1 hour, and 4 hours after the morning dose 
Week 24: pre-dose and between 2 and 4 hours after the morning dose 
Study population: From Study 124, PK data was available for Part A/Cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7. Study 
124 data was added to a subset of the prior ivacaftor POP-PK data set that was previously constructed. 
Methods: Nonlinear-mixed effect modelling was performed using NONMEM to construct a popPK model of 
IVA. In this analysis, the objective was to explore different IVA apparent oral clearance (CL/F) 
relationships to account for maturation as requested by CHMP.  
A formal covariate search was not conducted. Instead, the effect of weight on CL/F was considered by 
either fixing the CL/F allometric exponent to 0.75, or implementing an empirical function to account for 
the effect of weight on CL/F. 
Only the weight and age effects described above were tested as covariates affecting CL/F. Covariates 
were evaluated based on the improvement of the diagnostic plots, biological plausibility, and meaningful 
changes in the objective function. The suitability of all models was checked using standard goodness of fit 
plots and visual predictive checks. 
Using select IVA population PK models, IVA exposures of area under the concentration-time curve for a 
dosing interval at steady state (AUCss or AUC0-12h) were simulated for ages of 4 to <6 months at pre-
specified weight groups of 5 to <7 kg and 7 to <14 kg. Steady state exposures were simulated for IVA 
doses of 15 mg q12h, 25 mg q12h, and 50 mg q12h. These results were compared to the adult reference 
range (i.e., the 5th and 95th percentiles of adult exposures). Body weights for the 4 to <6-month-old age 
group were randomly sampled from the World Health Organization growth charts 
(https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm). At least 1000 subjects were sampled for each pre-
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 13/83 
 
 
  
  
 
specified weight group. These simulations provide an appropriate comparison of the central tendency in 
AUC0-12h between these groups. 
For the selected updated IVA popPK models, steady-state IVA AUC0-12h and Cmin values for Cohort7 
from Study 124 were also calculated from empirical Bayes estimates and summarized (arithmetic mean 
and standard deviation). This cohort included subjects 4 to <6 months of age. 
Exposure results: 
Mean plasma concentrations of IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA in Part A/Cohort 3 (Table 2) were consistent 
with plasma concentrations in subjects 6 months to <6 years of age and ≥12 years of age. These results 
supported continuing to dose this age group in Part B/Cohort 7 with the modifications described above. 
Mean plasma concentrations of IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA after 24 weeks of dosing IVA 25 mg q12h in 
Part B/Cohort 7 are presented in Table 2. The mean IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA plasma concentrations in 
subjects 4 to <6 months of age in Part B/Cohort 7 were consistent with plasma concentrations previously 
observed in subjects 6 months to <6 years of age and ≥12 years of age. 
Structural population PK model: 
A popPK model that describes IVA disposition was used to evaluate the PK data from Study 124 including 
data from both Part A/Cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7 which used a sparse PK sampling approach. Based on 
the PK results of Part A/Cohort 3, Part B/Cohort 7 was limited to subjects 4 to less than 6 months of age. 
The objectives of the popPK analysis were to characterize the PK of IVA in subjects with CF 3 months 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 14/83 
 
 
  
  
 
through 18 years of age and to compare exposures of subjects 4 to <6 months of age (the age group for 
which approval is being sought) to those previously obtained in adults.  
PK data from Study 124 (both Part A/Cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7) were integrated with an existing 
dataset of Phase 3 studies conducted in subjects with CF, including paediatric subjects ≥6 months 
through 18 years of age. 
IVA PK was described by a 2-compartment model with zero-order delivery to the absorption compartment 
and subsequent first-order absorption. The model incorporates both weight and age as predictors of 
apparent oral clearance (CL/F). Allometric relationships using body weight with fixed exponents were 
incorporated for volume and intercompartmental clearance parameters to describe other effects of body 
size on IVA PK.  
The estimates of PK model parameters for the reference subject are provided in the popPK report. The 
medians of the individual parameter estimates for IVA in CF subjects from Part B/Cohort 7 (ages 4 to <6 
months of age) were 4.33 L/h for CL/F, 9.13 L for apparent central volume (Vc/F), 9.60 L for apparent 
peripheral volume (Vp/F), 2.40 L/h for inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F), 2.79 h for zero-order dose 
duration (D1), and 0.191 h-1 for the first-order absorption rate (ka). Most parameters were estimated 
precisely. In prior popPK analyses, body weight and age were the most significant predictors of IVA 
disposition; other covariates (race, gender, and patient status [CF versus healthy subject]) did not 
explain a significant portion of the inter-subject variability. For the current paediatric analysis, body 
weight and age were incorporated into the model to describe their effects on IVA disposition. 
Table 3: Model Run Log  
From Table 4, the empirical model with maturation (Model 104) and the allometric model without 
maturation (Model 101) provide the most parsimonious descriptions of the data. Further investigation was 
performed to explore the fit of these models to the data (See tables and figures below).

IVA exposures: 
In Part A/Cohort 3 (subjects 3 to <6 months of age), mean plasma concentrations of IVA, M1-IVA, and 
M6-IVA were consistent with plasma concentrations in subjects 6 months to <6 years of age and ≥12 
years of age. Similarly, in Part B/Cohort 7 (subjects 4 to <6 months of age), mean plasma concentrations 
of IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA were consistent with plasma concentrations in subjects 6 months to <6 years 
of age and ≥12 years of age. 
Results from the selected final popPK model (104, empirical model with maturation) show that in subjects 
4 to <6 months of age administered 25 mg q12h IVA granules in Study 124, IVA AUC exposure was 
similar to that observed in adults administered IVA 150 mg tablets q12h as shown in Figure 3. The 
majority of the AUC exposures are predicted to be in the adult exposure range, albeit at the lower end of 
this range. These exposures are deemed appropriate given that IVA is a sensitive CYP3A substrate and 
there is a potential for higher IVA exposures due to the variability in CYP3A maturation in this age group.

Figure 3: Predicted IVA AUC Distribution in Subjects 4 to <6 Months With CF 
Exposure parameters for IVA in subjects with CF, as determined from the popPK model, are compared 
across age groups in Table 6. The AUC exposure levels of IVA in subjects 4 to <6 months of age in Study 
124 are similar with those previously shown to be safe and efficacious in Phase 3 studies in subjects with 
CF 6 months to <6 years of age and ≥12 years of age (Studies 102, 108, and 124). These exposure data 
for IVA and metabolites confirm the appropriateness of the doses evaluated in Study 124 for the 
treatment of CF patients 4 to <6 months of age.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new data have been provided regarding the mechanism of action and primary/secondary 
pharmacology and this is acceptable for this type of application. The pharmacodynamic profile of Kalydeco 
is already well described.     
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ivacaftor in the target age group of patients from 3 months of age until 6 
months was investigated in Study 124. In Part A/Cohort 3 (subjects 3 to <6 months of age), mean 
plasma concentrations of IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA were consistent with plasma concentrations in 
subjects 6 months to <6 years of age and ≥12 years of age. Similarly, in Part B/Cohort 7 (subjects 4 to 
<6 months of age), mean plasma concentrations of IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA were consistent with 
plasma concentrations in subjects 6 months to <6 years of age and ≥12 years of age. 
The Clinical Pharmacology of ivacaftor in paediatric patients from 3 to 6 months of age has been 
characterized using a previous population PK model developed in older paediatric and adult patients. The 
popPK model has been updated to account for the allometric and maturation effects observed in CL. Two 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020

alternatives were finally selected and assessed with the experimental observations of IVA. The popPK 
model including simultaneously an empirical function to describe the maturation effect based on body 
weight and allometric effects provided a better description of the data. This approach was accepted by 
CHMP. 
The MAH provided the experimental and predicted IVA AUC values after 50 mg q12h from Part A model-
predicted IVA AUC values in paediatric patients receiving 50 mg q12h are slightly over-predicted 
compared to the very few experimental AUC observations (only available in paediatric patients from 7 to 
<14 kg). This result suggests that the dosing recommendation proposed in paediatric patients from 3 to 6 
months of age from 7 to <14 kg (50 mg q12h) is adequate since the experimental IVA AUC values lay 
within the 5th and 95th percentile region of the adult exposure. 
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH provided confirmation that Cmin observations available in paediatric 
patients from 4 to <6 months of age from 5 to <14 kg of weight were adequately captured by model 
predictions. 
Results from the popPK model show that in subjects 4 to <6 months of age administered 25 mg q12h IVA 
granules in Study 124, IVA AUC exposure was similar to that observed in adults administered IVA 150 mg 
tablets q12h. The majority of the AUC exposures are predicted to be in the adult exposure range, albeit at 
the lower end of this range. These exposures are deemed appropriate given that IVA is a sensitive CYP3A 
substrate and there is a potential for higher IVA exposures due to the variability in CYP3A maturation in 
this age group. Thus, the suggested dose recommendation for this age group is supported by the popPK 
data.    
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The recommended dose of IVA granules for patients 4 to <6 months is 25 mg for patients weighing >5kg, 
administered q12h with fat-containing food. The proposed dosing recommendation is agreed by the 
CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy presented for this extension of indication is based on an interim analysis from study 124 
reporting data from subjects 3 to <6 months of age (Part A/Cohort 3) and subjects 4 to <6 months of 
age (Part B/Cohort 7).  
Study 124 is an ongoing, phase 3, 2-part, open-label study in subjects <24 months with 1 of the 
following mutations on at least 1 CFTR allele: G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, 
S1255P, or G1349D. Subjects with an R117H mutation were eligible to enrol in regions where IVA was 
granted marketing authorization for use in patients 2 through 5 years of age with an R117H mutation. 
Part A had a 5-day treatment period to assess safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in advance of Part B, 
and Part B had a 24-week treatment period to assess safety, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and 
acceptability/palatability.  
Given the underlying pathophysiology of CF and as outlined in the ICH guideline E11 (Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population), efficacy data in subjects 4 to <6 months 
of age can also be extrapolated from data from older populations of subjects as suggested below: 
•  Results from placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies in subjects with CF ≥6 years of age who had the 
G551D mutation (Studies 102 and 103) or a non-G551D gating mutation (Study 111) showed 
that IVA is effective in the treatment of subjects with CF, as evidenced by sustained 
improvements in CFTR channel function (measured by reduction in sweat chloride concentration) 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 32/83 
 
 
  
  
and corresponding substantial and durable improvements in lung function, pulmonary 
exacerbations, respiratory symptoms, and weight gain. 
• 
In addition, the safety, PK, PD and efficacy of IVA treatment in subjects 2 through 5 years of age 
with a gating mutation was evaluated in open-label Study 108. Results of Study 108 
demonstrated the safety and PK of IVA treatment in subjects 2 through 5 years of age. 
Furthermore, results from Study 108 demonstrated that IVA improved CFTR function in subjects 2 
through 5 years of age, with corresponding positive effects on pancreatic function, and nutritional 
status. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose-response study has been performed, however, selection of doses for Part A and Part B in 
Study 124 was supported by PopPK simulation data.  
Based on the dosing regimen confirmed in part A/Cohort 3, patients received 25 mg ivacaftor every 12 
hours in Part B/Cohort 7. Initially, Cohort 7 was planned to include children aged 0-6 months. In part A, 
one subject who received 25 mg q12h ivacaftor had an AUC value above the 95th percentile of that 
observed in the adult population, suggesting that IVA exposures may be impacted by maturation at this 
age. To ensure IVA exposure did not exceed the targeted adult range (95th percentile), Part B/Cohort 7 
was limited to subjects 4 to <6 months of age, weighing ≥5 kg.  
2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 
Study VX15-770-124 (Study 124): A Phase 3, 2-Part, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who 
Are Less Than 24 Months of Age at Treatment Initiation and Have a CFTR Gating Mutation 
Methods 
Study 124 is an ongoing Phase 3, 2-part, open-label study of orally administered IVA in subjects with CF 
who were <24 months of age at treatment initiation (Day 1) and have a CFTR gating mutation or R117H 
(currently in the US only) on at least 1 allele. This present analysis of data from study 124 corresponds to 
the Interim Analysis 3 Report in the cohort of patients from 3 to less than 6 months of age. Part A was 
designed to evaluate the safety and PK of multiple-dose administration of IVA over 4 days of dosing, and 
to confirm (or adjust if necessary) the doses for Part B. Part B was designed to evaluate the safety, PK, 
PD, and efficacy of IVA in subjects over 24 weeks.

Figure 4: Study 124 Design 
The study is ongoing as younger subjects are being enrolled in subsequent descending age cohorts of the 
study following PK and safety assessments for each age cohort, as follows:  
−  Cohort 1: subjects aged 12 to <24 months  
−  Cohort 2: subjects aged 6 to <12 months 
−  Cohort 3: subjects aged 3 to <6 months 
−  Cohort 4: subjects aged 0 to <3 months 
Subjects will be enrolled in Part B sequentially in the following cohorts based on age at Day 1 of Part B: 
−  Cohort 5: subjects aged 12 to <24 months 
−  Cohort 6: subjects aged 6 to <12 months 
−  Cohort 7: subjects aged 4 to <6 months 
Subjects 3 to <6 months of age were enrolled in Part A/Cohort 3. To ensure IVA exposure was not above 
the adult 95th percentile, the Part B/Cohort 7 dose and age range were selected such that Part B/Cohort 
7 was limited to subjects 4 to <6 months of age weighing ≥5 kg. 
Cohorts 3 and cohort 7 are the subject of this application and assessed thereafter.

Treatments 
IVA granules were administered orally every 12 hours (q12h) at the doses presented in Table 7 (Study 
124 IVA Doses) after mixing with approximately 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of appropriate liquid or soft food and 
administered with an age-appropriate fat-containing meal or snack. 
Table 7: Study 124 IVA Doses 
In Part A, IVA was administered for 4 days to obtain steady-state concentrations of IVA. 
In Part B, IVA was administered for 24 weeks. This treatment duration was consistent with analyses of 
Phase 3 studies of IVA in subjects ≥2 years of age (Studies 102, 103, and 108).

Sample size 
A minimum of 5 subjects were planned to enrol in each of the cohorts for Parts A and B. In this interim 
analysis, the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and Safety Set included: 
• 
• 
Part A/Cohort 3: 6 subjects who enrolled in Cohort 1 and received at least 1 dose of IVA 
Part B/Cohort 7: 6 subjects who enrolled in Cohort 5 and received at least 1 dose of IVA 
Randomisation 
Not applicable, as this was a single-treatment-arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Study 124 is still ongoing study. The sample size was based on the availability of the subject population 
and PK analysis considerations, and not on any statistical consideration. Therefore, the study is not 
powered to detect a significant treatment effect. Continuous variables and categorical variables were 
summarized by standard descriptive statistics. The CHMP considered that the applied descriptive methods 
were adequate for the limited study goals set in protocol.  
Results 
Participant flow 
PART A: A total of 6 subjects were enrolled and included in the Safety Set. All 6 subjects completed 4 
days of treatment. 
PART B: A total of 6 subjects were enrolled and included in the Safety Set. All subjects completed the 24 
weeks of treatment. No subjects prematurely discontinued study drug treatment 
Recruitment 
Subjects from Cohort 3 were enrolled at 6 sites in the UK, and the US. Subjects from Cohort 7 were 
enrolled at 6 sites in the UK and the US.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was amended once but did not have a major impact on the conduct of the study. 
A dose justification memo (05 November 2018) provided an update to the cohort age and dose for 
subjects in Part B/Cohort 7 such that enrolment would be limited to subjects 4 to <6 months of age, 
weighing ≥5 kg.  
Protocol deviations 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 37/83 
 
 
  
  
There was 1 protocol deviation that was identified as an important protocol deviation (IPD). Due to 
pharmacist oversight at the Week 8 Visit, one subject was incorrectly dispensed 25 mg IVA instead of 50 
mg IVA. The subject should have received 50 mg IVA at this visit because the subject had reached 6 
months of age and weighed >7 kg. The subject was correctly dispensed the correct dose (50 mg IVA) 
approximately 1 week later. No safety concerns were identified.  
The data cut for this interim analysis occurred on 13 January 2020. 
Baseline data 
PART A/Cohort 3 
Demographics: The mean age of the 3 subjects in the 25-mg group was 3.3 months (range: 3 to 4 
months) at Day 1. In the 50-mg group, the mean age of the 3 subjects was 5.0 months (range: 5 to 5 
months). All 6 subjects were White and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. All subjects had the G551D 
mutation. The most prevalent genotype was G551D/F508del (5 of 6 subjects).  
Baseline characteristics: In general, as expected from the weight-based dosing, weight, length, weight-
for-length, and body mass index (BMI) values were greater in the subjects in the 50-mg group than in 
the subjects in the 25-mg group, see table 8 below.

Prior and concomitant medications: In general, concomitant medication use was typical of a CF 
population. The most commonly reported concomitant medications were vitamins (100.0%), medications 
related to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (83.3%), and salbutamol (50.0%). Flucloxacillin, 
paracetamol, and ranitidine were each taken by 33.3% of subjects. 
PART B /Cohort 7 
Demographics: The mean weight at baseline was 6.9 kg (range: 5.9 to 7.9 kg). The mean age at baseline 
was 4.5 months (range: 4 to 5 months). All subjects were White and of non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. 
Five subjects had a G551D mutation, and 1 subject had an R117H mutation. The most prevalent 
genotype was G551D/F508del (4 of 6 subjects).  
Baseline characteristics: weight, length, weight-for-length, and BMI values were within the normal range, 
but below the median of the reference population, for this age group, see table 9 below.

Prior and concomitant medication: In general, concomitant medication use was typical of a CF population. 
The most commonly reported concomitant medications were vitamins (100.0%), medications related to 
pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (83.3%), and sodium chloride (66.7%). Amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, 
and salbutamol were each taken by 33.3% of subjects. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Sweat chloride (Secondary efficacy pharmacodynamic endpoint): 
The absolute changes from baseline were calculated at each time point for those subjects in Part B/Cohort 
7 that had both a baseline value and a value at that time point. Two subjects had a missing baseline 
sample because of insufficient sweat sample volume or test not performed. For these subjects, historical 
sweat chloride values were used for baseline. Five subjects did not have a Week 2 sweat chloride 
measurement (1 not collected, 4 sweat sample volumes were insufficient). Three subjects did not have 
sweat chloride measurements at Week 24: for 1 subject, measurements were not collected, and for 2 
subjects, sweat sample volumes were insufficient. 
The mean (SD) sweat chloride level at baseline was 97.4 (16.4) mmol/L. Mean absolute sweat chloride 
levels decreased (improved) by Week 2 to near carrier levels, and this improvement was durable during 
the 24-week treatment period (Figure 11-1). The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in sweat 
chloride was -34.0 (SD not applicable [NA]) mmol/L (n = 1) at Week 2, -65.6 (12.0) mmol/L (n = 5) at 
Week 12, and -50.0 (17.3) mmol/L (n = 3) at Week 24. Mean absolute changes from baseline in sweat 
chloride concentration are summarized in Table 11 and Figure 5. 
The absolute changes from baseline in sweat chloride are summarised in Table 11 and Figure 5 below.

Nutritional status (Tertiary efficacy endpoint): 
For each nutritional parameter evaluated, mean values were normal at baseline, but below the median of 
the reference population, and increased during the 24 weeks of IVA treatment. Mean absolute changes 
from baseline at Week 24 demonstrated increases in weight, length, and weight-for-length and their 
corresponding z-scores. Results for each nutritional parameter are summarized below.

[MSSA]), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa; mucoid, 
non-mucoid, and small colony variant) at baseline and Week 24. 
• 
• 
Two subjects had positive H. influenzae cultures at baseline, and negative cultures at Week 24. A 
different subject had a negative culture at baseline, and a positive culture at Week 24. 
Two subjects had positive MSSA cultures at baseline; 1 of these subjects had a positive culture at 
Week 24. Two additional subjects who had negative MSSA cultures at baseline had positive 
cultures at Week 24. 
No cases of MRSA, P. aeruginosa, or Burkholderia were observed over the treatment period. 
Pulmonary Exacerbations 
Two definitions were used for the analyses of PEx because there is no consensus definition for PEx in 
younger paediatric patients. 
Number of Pulmonary Exacerbations 
•  Definition 1: 2 (33.3%) subjects had a total of 2 PEx events (event rate/year = 0.73). 
•  Definition 2: 1 (16.7%) subject had a total of 1 PEx event (event rate/year = 0.37). 
Duration of Pulmonary Exacerbations 
•  Definition 1: normalized mean (SD) duration was 9.4 (14.8) days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 46/83 
 
 
  
  
 
•  Definition 2: normalized mean (SD) duration was 5.4 (13.2) days. 
Time-to-first Pulmonary Exacerbation 
•  Definition 1: The event-free probability was 0.667 (95% CI: 0.195, 0.904) at Week 24. Seventy-
five percent of subjects were event-free for 11.4 weeks; median and 25th percentile were not 
estimated. 
•  Definition 2: The event-free probability was 0.833 (95% CI: (0.273, 0.975) at Week 24, and 
therefore median, 25th, and 75th percentiles for event-free time were not estimated. 
No obvious trends could be discerned from the patterns of the Kaplan-Meier curves of PEx.  
CF-related Hospitalizations 
One subject had 1 CF-related hospitalization (event rate/year = 0.37). This subject was hospitalized for 
viral aetiology. The normalized mean (SD) duration of CF-related hospitalizations was 0.7 (1.8) days. 
Measures of Pancreatic Function and Inflammation 
Faecal elastase (FE-1) 
An increase in the mean FE-1 was observed by Week 2 and sustained through Week 24, suggesting 
improvement in pancreatic exocrine function with IVA treatment. The mean FE-1 at Week 24 (398.3 
μg/g) was increased compared to baseline (184.0 μg/g). The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline 
was 86.5 (75.5) μg/g (n = 4) at Week 2 and 181.0 (122.9) μg/g (n = 4) at Week 24.

Figure 8: Mean absolute change from Baseline in Fecal Elastase-1, FAS, Part B/Cohort 7 
Subjects with CF who have FE-1 levels ≤200 μg/g are considered pancreatic insufficient.  
Four subjects had FE-1 values at baseline and at Week 24; one subject did not have an FE-1 value at 
baseline or Week 24 and one subject did not have an FE-1 value at Week 24: 
• 
Three subjects were pancreatic insufficient (FE-1 values ≤200 μg/g) at baseline. 
o  Two of the 3 subjects with FE-1 values ≤200 μg/g at baseline had FE-1 values >200 μg/g 
at Week 24 (values >200 μg/g are indicative of pancreatic sufficiency). 
o  One subject did not have a Week 24 FE-1 value but had an FE-1 value >200 μg/g at 
Week 12 (the last visit at which FE-1 was determined for this subject). 
• 
• 
Two subjects had FE-1 values >200 μg/g at baseline. FE-1 values in these 2 subjects remained 
>200 μg/g throughout the 24 weeks of treatment. 
The subject with a missing baseline and Week 24 FE-1 value had FE-1 values >200 μg/g at all 
other study visits.

IRT 
The mean IRT level decreased over the 24-week treatment period, suggesting improvement in pancreatic 
inflammation/injury with IVA treatment. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at Week 24 in IRT 
was -593.8 (402.5) ng/mL (n = 4). The absolute changes from baseline were only calculated at each time 
point for those subjects who had a baseline value.

Lipase and amylase 
Lipase and amylase levels were collected as part of safety assessments. The results are included in the 
efficacy assessments because they are useful indicators of pancreatic inflammation/injury. Lipase values 
were elevated at baseline and rapidly decreased during IVA treatment in both Parts A and B. Amylase 
levels were elevated at baseline and generally stable throughout the 24 weeks of treatment. 
In Part A/Cohort 3, 6 of 6 subjects had lipase and amylase results at both baseline and Day 5. For these 
subjects, there was a reduction in the mean lipase value at Day 5; the mean amylase value was stable. 
In Part B/Cohort 7, there was a mean decrease in lipase levels observed by Week 2 that was sustained 
through Week 24, suggesting reduced pancreatic inflammation/injury with IVA treatment. Mean amylase 
levels were generally stable throughout the 24 weeks of treatment. 
Part A/Cohort 3: 
•  Mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in lipase level at Day 5 was -139.83 (76.71) U/L (n = 
6). 
•  Mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in amylase level at Day 5 was -1.2 (11.0) U/L (n = 6). 
Part B/Cohort 7: 
•  Mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in lipase level at Week 24 was -258.67 (158.41) U/L (n 
= 6). 
•  Mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in amylase level at Week 24 was -10.3 (37.2) U/L (n = 
6). 
Markers of Intestinal Inflammation (faecal calprotectin) 
Mean faecal calprotectin levels decreased over the 24 weeks of treatment. The mean (SD) absolute 
change from baseline at Week 24 in faecal calprotectin was -150.40 (324.43) μg/g, suggesting 
improvement in intestinal inflammation. The normal range of reference for faecal calprotectin is 15.6 to 
162.9 μg/g, however the range in CF infants has been reported to be much larger.

Palatability 
A palatability assessment was performed at the Day 1 Visit. The administered doses of IVA were 
palatable; all subjects fully consumed the dose. The majority of subjects (5 [83.4%]) liked the food with 
study drug (either very much or a little).

Notes 
the study is currently ongoing, End of Interim Analysis: 11 December 2019 
(date last subject in Cohort 7 completed Part B Week 24 Visit) 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The results from the Phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in subjects with the G551D gating mutation 
≥6 years of age (Studies 102 and 103) and subjects with a non-G551D gating mutation (Study 111) are 
summarized in the Table 20 below (model-based treatment differences). In all 3 studies, IVA was highly 
effective across 24 weeks of treatment as evidenced by improvement in CFTR function and substantial 
improvements in clinically important outcomes, including ppFEV1, respiratory symptoms, and nutritional 
status. 
Mean absolute changes from baseline of selected efficacy endpoints from placebo-controlled Studies 102, 
103, and 111 and from open-label studies of subjects with a gating mutation ≥2 through 5 years of age 
(Study 108), subjects with a gating mutation 12 to <24 months of age (Study 124, Cohort 5), and 
subjects with a gating mutation 6 to <12 months of age (Study 124, Cohort 6), are shown in Table 21. 
Results from these previous studies provide context for the efficacy results of subjects 4 to <6 months of 
age in Part B/Cohort 7 of Study 124. In both placebo-controlled and open-label studies, treatment with 
IVA led to improvement in CFTR function.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 124 is an ongoing, open-label, 2-part phase 3 study to assess safety, PK, PD, efficacy and 
acceptability/palatability of ivacaftor patients <24 months of age, who have a gating type CFTR mutation 
in at least one allele. This submission is based on:  
• 
• 
• 
Interim analysis of Cohorts 3 and 7 data from study 124 in patients from 3 months to less than 6 
months of age. 
Efficacy and safety results of study 108 (children aged 2-5 years), 
previous evidence from well-controlled studies in CF subjects aged 6 years or older with gating 
mutations, 
This approach is considered appropriate to support an extension of indication. Lack of randomisation 
limits conclusion, however, extrapolation of efficacy from adults, adolescents and children of other age 
groups is accepted as the pathophysiology of the underlying disease and the mechanism of action of 
ivacaftor is the same. 
No formal dose-response study was conducted, selection of doses for Part A/Cohort3 and Part B/Cohort7 
was supported by simulation exercise using previously developed popPK modelling. With proposed dose 
the same AUC values were targeted as that in adults and children aged >6 months. Subjects 3 to <6 
months of age were enrolled in Part A/Cohort 3. To ensure ivacaftor exposure was not above the adult 
95th percentile, the Part B/Cohort 7 dose and age range were selected such that Part B/Cohort 7 was 
limited to subjects 4 to <6 months of age. In Part A, subjects received ivacaftor q12h based on body 
weight: 25 mg q12h, 5 to <7 kg or 50 mg q12h 7 to <14 kg. In Part B, all subjects 4 to <6 months of 
age received ivacaftor 25 mg q12h regardless of weight.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria in study 124 were appropriate and mostly in line with previous studies 
conducted with ivacaftor in children. Diagnosis of CF was based on abnormal sweat test OR presence of 
two CF-causing mutations. Inclusion criteria did not include clinical features of CF lung disease, this was 
acknowledged by CHMP. Lung and other organ damage are evident at this very young age, these children 
usually do not present lung disease manifestations, the leading clinical signs or symptoms are related to 
GI tract manifestations rather (i.e. malnutrition). 
Subjects were encouraged to remain on their prescribed CF therapies during Study 124. Selected 
concurrent medications, such as moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers, were prohibited if the 
potential existed for untoward drug-drug interactions. 
Safety and PK were evaluated in Part A (4 days of ivacaftor treatment, assessed over 5 days to obtain 
steady-state concentrations). Safety, PK, PD, efficacy (tertiary parameters: nutritional parameters, 
biomarkers for pancreatic and intestinal inflammation, pulmonary exacerbation and hospitalisation due to 
CF), and acceptability/palatability were evaluated in Part B (24 weeks of ivacaftor treatment). Infant 
pulmonary function test (IPFT) and lung clearance index (LCI)/ multiple breath washout (MBW) 
assessments were not conducted in any of the 4- to <6-month-old subjects in Cohort 7. 
The efficacy evaluation was a tertiary objective in this study (Part B, Cohort 7). Efficacy was assessed by 
using nutritional parameters, biomarkers for pancreatic and intestinal inflammation, pulmonary 
exacerbation, and hospitalisation due to CF. Lung function by spirometry cannot be measured in this age 
group and if it could it was not informative for disease. To measure ventilation inhomogeneity, usually 
lung clearance index (LCI) measure is encouraged in young children. This is a multiple breath washout

parameter detected by inert gas inhalation. LCI is an encouraged parameter to test small children’s 
ventilation; however, the test requires specific centres. 
Study protocol amendments to the original study protocol were made but overall are not considered to 
have a major impact on the conduct of the study. Study protocol and SAP (last version 2.3) amendments 
were performed before data cut for the third interim analysis. According to a dose justification memo, 
enrolment into Part B/Cohort 7 was limited to children 4 to <6 months of age. This was acknowledged by 
CHMP.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In this third interim analysis from study 124, the Full Analysis Set and Safety Set included 6 subjects who 
enrolled in Cohort 3 (Part A), and 6 subjects who enrolled in Cohort 7 (Part B). Six subjects received 25 
mg ivacaftor q12h at Day 1; all subjects completed the study. Six subjects received an increased dose of 
50 mg IVA q12h during the study after reaching 6 months of age and 7 kg. Study population of Cohorts 3 
and 7 reflected well the targeted population.  
In cohort 7, Part B of study 124, the mean weight at baseline was 6.9 kg (range: 5.9 to 7.9 kg). The 
mean age at baseline was 4.5 months (range: 4 to 5 months). Five subjects had a G551D mutation, and 
1 subject had an R117H mutation. The most prevalent genotype was G551D/F508del (4 of 6 subjects). 
The most commonly reported concomitant medications were vitamins (100%), medications related to 
pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (83.3%), and sodium chloride (66.7%). Amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, 
and salbutamol were each taken by 33.3% of subjects.  
In part B, the mean (SD) sweat chloride value at baseline was 97.4 (16.4) mmol/L. Nutritional 
parameters (weight, length, weight-for-age z-score, length-for-age z-scores, weight-for-length-for-age z-
scores, and weight-for-length percentiles) were normal at baseline, but below the median of the 
reference population. Some children /child must have been undernourished at baseline, as minimum 
values suggest. 3 out of 6 children had pancreatic failure, 3 children had CF lung disease. In this cohort, 
only one patient had week 2 sweat chloride measure, but, in this single patient, reduction of Cl was 
substantial at week 2. At week 12, there were five patients and at week 24, there were 3 patients who 
had sweat chloride measures. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -34.0 
(mmol/L (n = 1) at week 2, 
65.6 (12.0) mmol/L (n = 5) at week 12, and -50.0 (17.3) mmol/L (n = 3) at 
week 24. These data are comparable to that previously observed with ivacaftor treatment in other 
children and adolescents. 
‑
Mean nutritional parameters were normal at baseline, but below the median of the reference population, 
and increased during the 24 weeks of ivacaftor treatment. Mean absolute changes from baseline were: 
weight, +2.5 kg; length, +9.3 cm, weight-for-length percentile, +20.0%; normalized mean changes 
were: weight-for-age z-score, +0.82; length-for-age z-score, +0.56; and weight-for-length-for-age z-
score, +0.68. Study subjects were between 4 and 5 months of age at baseline. All 6 patients had both 
baseline and week 24 data available. Weight-for-length percentile improvement of +20% suggest an 
overall improvement in nutrition. Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH compared the change from baseline 
through week 24 in weight, length and respective z-scores of study subjects to historical values in those 
who were not treated with ivacaftor and had the same mutation in CFTR gene and were at the same age. 
Nutritional parameters of six patients from study 124, Cohort 7 and 19 subjects’ data from US Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry were presented for comparative reasons. Due to very small numbers 
and non-matched comparison, data should be compared with caution and interpretation has limitations. 
Data from treated and untreated patients show similar patterns. Mean change from baseline in weight, 
length and respective z-scores are similar in magnitude. Additional nutritional data and narratives 
provided for subjects with weight-for-length-for-age z-scores slightly below -1 SD at screening. All of

them had week 24 weight-for-length-for-age z-score increased to within 1 SD, one of them had above 0. 
No serious AEs occurred in any of these subjects. Non-serious AEs occurred in these subjects were 
moderate or mild in severity, not related to study drug and resolved without treatment (URTI, vomiting 
diarrhea, rhinorrea) or with treatment (otitis media or cough/antibiotic). 
No cases of MRSA, P. aeruginosa, or Burkholderia were observed over the treatment period. In this study, 
2 definitions of PEx were used for analyses because there is no consensus definition for PEx in younger 
paediatric subjects. Definition 1: 2 (33.3%) subjects had a total of 2 PEx events (event rate/year = 
0.73). Definition 2: 1 (16.7%) subject had a total of 1 PEx event (event rate/year = 0.37). There were no 
identifiable trends in qualitative microbiology oropharyngeal culture outcomes, however, any firm trend 
for PEx or microbiology was not expected due to the very limited sample size and short period; and to the 
characteristics of this patient population (generally low rate of events).  
Mean increases in Faecal Elastase-1 (FE-1) were observed by week 2 and sustained through Week 24. 
The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in FE-1 at week 24 was 181.0 (122.9) μg/g (n = 4), 
suggesting improvement in pancreatic function with ivacaftor treatment. 3 subjects were pancreatic 
insufficient (FE-1 values ≤200 μg/g) at baseline. These 3 subjects had FE-1 values >200 μg/g at week 
24 (n = 2) or at the last available FE-1 assessment, week 12 (n = 1). The remaining 3 subjects were 
pancreatic sufficient (FE-1 values >200 μg/g). 5/6 patients received pancreatic enzyme replacement. 
Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was continued throughout the study in subjects who were 
pancreatic insufficient at baseline and had FE-1 levels above 200 μg/g. 
Immunoreactive trypsin and/or trypsinogen (IRT) is a marker for pancreatic duct obstruction and 
elevated in neonates with CF. As CF disease progresses and pancreatic tissue becomes more fibrotic, IRT 
levels decline. In Cohort 7, 1/6 patient had stable high (1200 ng/ml) IRT values through week 24 of 
observation, 1/6 had slight decrease in IRT and in 3/6 subjects IRT levels decreased continuously and 
substantially through week 24. Absolute mean change (SD) from baseline in IRT at week 24 was -593.8 
(402.5) ng/mL (n = 4). This decrease was comparable that seen in previous age groups of children in 
study 124. As discussed in previous assessments of Kalydeco (II/69 and X/75) the assay used in children 
aged 2 to less than 6 years of age (study 108) to measure IRT is not the same as the one used in study 
124 as the values cannot be directly compared. IRT levels are expected to decline with age, but the rapid 
and steep decline after starting ivacaftor in this limited number of subjects who were pancreatic 
insufficient at baseline strongly suggests a treatment effect and, supports the hypothesis that early 
intervention with ivacaftor can improve pancreatic function in young children. As IRT levels decrease with 
age, in the lack of control group definite interpretation of IRT data is not possible (to what extent it can 
be attributed to ivacaftor). However, this issue cannot be further pursued due to very low number of 
patients with week 24 result (4 patients) and since the IRT decrease in 3/6 subject along with results on 
FE-1, lipase, amylase and nutritional parameters, may support assumption of beneficial effect of ivacaftor 
on pancreatic manifestation of CF. 
Lipase has been reported to be increased at birth in patients with CF and to decline over the first years of 
life, and the decline has been linked to the development of pancreatic insufficiency. Regarding normal 
range (LLN and ULN), limits are assay dependent. The MAH specified 1-17 U/L or 6-44 and 4-29 or 4-23 
U/L for amylase and lipase, respectively. It seems that all 6 patients had week 24 data for both lipase and 
amylase. The mean lipase level was elevated at baseline and a mean decrease in lipase was observed by 
week 2 and sustained through week 24, suggesting reduced pancreatic inflammation/injury with ivacaftor 
treatment. The mean amylase level was elevated at baseline and generally stable throughout the 24 
weeks of treatment. In Part B, absolute mean change from baseline in lipase level at Week 24 
was -258.67 (158.41) U/L (n = 6). Absolute mean change from baseline in amylase level at Week 24 
was -10.3 (37.2) U/L (n = 6). Similar findings were seen for lipase and amylase levels after 4 days of 
ivacaftor treatment, assessed across 5 days in Part A. In previous assessment it was concluded that 
values below the normal range for amylase and lipase appear to correlate with pancreatic insufficiency

and normal or above normal values with preservation of exocrine pancreatic function. In this study there 
were extremely low number of patients in each group, and similar patterns could be observed in both 
pancreatic insufficient and subjects with normal function, furthermore, lipase values decrease with time 
over the first years of life without ivacaftor treatment, as well. Amylase levels and changes were variable, 
and it is therefore agreed with the MAH that interpretation of data is strongly limited by a low contribution 
of pancreatic versus salivary to total amylase levels and variable kinetics of both fractions in this age 
group. Thus, no clear conclusion can be drawn on the impact of ivacaftor treatment on pancreatic 
function based on lipase and amylase measures merely, however, it seems reassuring that indeed, lipase 
values decreased to above-normal values in both patient groups through week 24.  
Mean faecal calprotectin (FC) levels decreased (improved) over 24 weeks of treatment. The mean (SD) 
absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was -150.40 (324.43) μg/g (n = 4). The MAH states that the 
normal range of reference for faecal calprotectin is 15.6 to 162.9 μg/g, however the range in CF infants 
has been reported to be much larger. According to individual faecal calprotectin data, 3 subjects might 
have had elevated FC level (based on 162.9 μg/g threshold, however, the reference range for this specific 
age group is not exactly known). It can be clearly seen at individual level that elevated FC levels 
decreased rapidly in the patients with elevated FC at baseline and levels fluctuates later on but generally 
remained lower than baseline at week 4,8,12 and 18. The MAH clarified previously (in procedure X/75), 
that faecal calprotectin (FC) is an inflammatory marker that it is not CF-specific which is known to be 
elevated in patients with CF, particularly in pancreatic insufficient (PI) patients (Garg M et al 2017). FC 
levels are usually low in infants with cystic fibrosis during the first year of life and increase afterwards 
until the age of four years remaining stable after than point. As a consequence of distinctive age-related 
variations in the values, careful interpretation of levels of FC is required in children under four years of 
age. Upon request by CHMP, the MAH confirmed that three out of 6 patients had elevated FC at baseline, 
following initiation of ivacaftor treatment all of 3 subjects had normal FC (at week 24 or at week12-in one 
case it was the last measurement). Although data are very scarce, this can be considered reassuring as it 
may suggest decreased intestinal inflammation in these individuals after initiation of ivacaftor. Of note, 
one subject who had normal FC value at BL, had elevated FC level at week 24. The MAH did not comment 
it further. This was not further pursued by CHMP.   
Palatability assessments indicated that IVA doses were palatable. All subjects in Part B accepted and fully 
consumed the first dose of study drug. 
A final CSR will be provided for Study 124 when completed, which will include a global analysis of safety 
and efficacy data from all age cohorts.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The third interim analysis of study 124 provides PK, safety, PD (sweat chloride) and some efficacy data 
(tertiary endpoints) of the treatment with ivacaftor in infants aged 4 to less than 6 months with at least a 
pre-specified gating mutation in an allele of the CFTR gene.  
Study 124 is an uncontrolled study and low sample size of PART B/Cohort 7 limits interpretation of the 
results. However, the robust decrease in sweat chloride comparable to that seen in previous studies 
/previous interim results in older subjects provide support for extrapolation of efficacy from placebo-
controlled Phase 3 studies in subjects ≥6 years of age and support the use of ivacaftor in children with CF 
4 to <6 months of age with indicated CFTR mutations. Beneficial effect of ivacaftor in this age group may 
be further supported by limited data on nutritional parameters and markers of exocrine pancreas 
function/GI inflammation.  
Based on results on the dosing regimen used in part A/Cohort 3, patients received 25 mg ivacaftor every 
12 hours in Part B/Cohort 7. Initially, Cohort 7 was planned to include children aged 0-6 months. 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 61/83 
 
 
  
  
In part A, one subject who received 25 mg q12h ivacaftor had an AUC value above the 95th percentile of 
that observed in the adult population, suggesting that IVA exposures may be impacted by maturation at 
this age. Therefore, in order to ensure that IVA exposure did not exceed the targeted adult range (95th 
percentile), Part B/Cohort 7 was limited to subjects 4 to <6 months of age, weighing ≥5 kg. Therefore, 
this justifies the indication from 4 months of age (see below).  
Overall, it is considered that from a clinical point, sufficient safety data has been provided to support the 
new indication from the age of 4 months as follows: 
Kalydeco granules are indicated for the treatment of infants aged at least 4 months, toddlers and children 
weighing 5 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have an R117H CFTR mutation or one of 
the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, 
S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
This extension of indication is based on the 3rd interim analysis of Study 124, an ongoing Phase 3, open-
label study of orally administered IVA in subjects with CF who were <24 months of age at treatment 
initiation (Day 1) and have a CFTR gating mutation or R117H (in the US only at the time of 3rd interim 
analysis) on at least 1 allele. This study consisted of two parts: in Part A, PK and safety was evaluated 
over 5 days (4 days of ivacaftor treatment) in four age cohorts. In part B, based on the dosing regimen 
confirmed in part A, safety, PK, PD, efficacy and acceptability/palatability of ivacaftor granules were 
investigated over 24 weeks.  
This submission includes data from subjects 3 to <6 months of age (Part A/Cohort 3) and subjects 4 to 
<6 months of age (Part B/Cohort 7) at Day 1 (ivacaftor treatment initiation). 
Primary objective of both parts of Study 124 was the evaluation of the safety of IVA in the above-
mentioned age cohorts (i.e. Cohort 3 in Part A and Cohort 7 in Part B).  
Adverse Events (AEs), clinical laboratory values (haematology and serum chemistry), ophthalmological 
and physical examinations, standard 12-lead ECGs and vital signs were defined as primary safety 
endpoints. 
Patient exposure 
In Part A/Cohort 3, 3 subjects received 25 mg IVA, and 3 subjects received 50 mg IVA. All 6 subjects 
completed the 5-day treatment period (4 days of IVA treatment).  
In Part B/Cohort 7, all 6 subjects received 25 mg IVA on Day 1, and all 6 completed the study. All 6 
received an increased dose of 50 mg IVA after reaching 6 months of age and 7 kg. The mean (SD) 
exposure to study drug was 23.8 (0.56) weeks (range: 23 to 24 weeks). 
Six subjects were enrolled and included in the Safety Set of Part A/Cohort 3. All 6 subjects completed 
Part A. No subjects continued into Part B/Cohort 7 because all subjects aged out before enrolment of Part 
B/Cohort 7 began. One subject enrolled in Part B/Cohort 6 (subjects 6 to <12 months of age) and 4 
subjects enrolled directly into the Extension Study 126. 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 62/83 
 
 
  
  
In Part B/Cohort 7, six subjects were enrolled and included in the Safety Set. No subject prematurely 
discontinued study drug treatment. After the completion of Study 124 Part B/Cohort 7, all 6 subjects from 
Cohort 7 was enrolled into Study 126 and therefore did not have a Follow-up Visit, per protocol. 
Adverse events 
Part A/Cohort 3 
Three (50.0%) of the 6 subjects had AEs: 1 (33.3%) subject in the 25-mg group and 2 (66.7%) subjects 
in the 50-mg group. No AE occurred in more than a single subject. AEs are presented by SOC and PT in 
Table 5.5.2. 
All but one AEs were mild or moderate of severity. The only severe AE was a thrombocytopenia AE, it was 
considered as a SAE as well and is described in detail in the Serious adverse event section of Clinical 
Safety part of this AR. 
None of the AEs were considered to be related to study drug by the investigator (related AEs include 
related and possibly related AEs).

Part B/Cohort 7 
All 6 patients experienced an AE; there were 19 AEs and 1 SAE in total. All but one AEs were mild or 
moderate in severity. The only severe AE was a bronchiolitis AE, it was considered as a SAE as well and is 
described in detail in the Serious adverse event section below. All AEs, including the SAE of bronchiolitis, 
were considered unlikely related or not related to study drug.

The SOCs with the greatest incidence of AEs were 1) infections and infestations and 2) respiratory, 
thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (Table 24). 
Most AEs were common manifestations of CF for patients in this age group. The most commonly occurring 
AEs (occurring in 2 or more subjects) included cough, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection. The 
incidence of AEs by SOC and PT is presented in Table 24. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Part A Cohort 3 
There were no deaths in Part A Cohort 3 of Study 124. 
A subject with a CFTR mutation had 1 SAE of thrombocytopenia. The SAE of thrombocytopenia was 
considered resolved (platelet count of 310 K/mm3).  
The subject continued into the Extension Study, Study 126, and platelet levels were in the normal range 
for the 84 weeks of IVA treatment to date. 
The SAE of thrombocytopenia was considered by the investigator to be severe in intensity and not related 
to study drug. Omeprazole was considered the suspect etiology. 
Part B Cohort 7 
There were no deaths in Study 124 Part B Cohort 7. 
A subject with a CFTR mutation had a SAE of bronchiolitis, which was considered by the investigator to be 
unlikely related to study drug. The SAE of bronchiolitis was considered resolved. 
The SAE of bronchiolitis was considered by the investigator to be severe in intensity and unlikely related 
to study drug. Acquired viral infection was considered as the alternative suspected etiology. 
Laboratory findings 
Part A Cohort 3 
Liver Function Test Results 
There were no LFT elevations considered to be AEs. The mean absolute changes from baseline to Day 5 
were not clinically significant for either dose group.  
There were no elevations in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin >2 × ULN. For ALT, maximum on-study elevation 
of ALT was found between 1xULN and 2xULN for 4 of 6 patients, while the remaining two patients 
experiences less than 1xULN maximal ALT elevation. For AST, all but one patient had maximum on-study 
elevation of less than 1xULN, the remaining one patient experienced a maximum AST elevation between 
1xULN and 2xULN. Maximum on-treatment value of total bilirubin was below 1xULN for all patients in Part 
A Cohort 3. 
Lipase and Amylase Results 
Lipase levels showed a decline after the start of IVA treatment in Part A/Cohort 3. The overall mean (SD) 
lipase level was 245.17 (125.52) U/L (normal range: 4 to 29 U/L [<6 months]; 4 to 23 U/L [6 months to 
<1 year]) at baseline and decreased to 105.33 (54.54) U/L at Day 5. The mean (SD) absolute change 
from baseline at Day 5 was -139.83 (76.71) U/L.  
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 65/83 
 
 
  
  
Serum amylase levels were generally stable during the 4 days of IVA treatment, assessed across 5 days 
in Part A/Cohort 3. The overall mean (SD) amylase level was 52.8 (25.4) U/L at baseline (normal range: 
1 to 17 U/L [<6 months]; 6 to 44 U/L [6 months to <1 year]) and was 51.7 (29.6) U/L at Day 5.  
Of note, Lipase and serum amylase levels were assessed as safety (clinical chemistry) parameters, 
however it is discussed in the Clinical efficacy part of this AR. 
Other Clinical Chemistry Parameters 
The mean changes from baseline in clinical chemistry parameters (excluding lipase, which trended 
downwards) were small and not considered clinically significant. There were no clinical chemistry values 
considered by the investigator to be AEs.  
Haematology 
For all parameters, the mean changes from baseline were small and not considered clinically significant. 
One subject had thrombocytopenia at Day 5; this event was considered to be an SAE (see part 
Deaths/Serious AEs of Clinical Safety section of this AR). There were no other haematology values 
considered by the investigator to be AEs. 
Part B Cohort 7 
Liver Function Test Results 
Fluctuations from baseline in mean LFT measurements throughout the 24-week treatment period were 
not considered clinically significant. All subjects had maximum on-treatment ALT, AST, and bilirubin ≤1 × 
(upper limit of normal) ULN. 
Lipase and Amylase 
Mean (SD) lipase at baseline was elevated at 308.83 (168.28) U/L (normal range: 4 to 29 U/L [<6 
months]; 4 to 23 U/L [6 months to 1 year]). The mean (SD) lipase level decreased to 50.17 (32.98) U/L 
at Week 24. 
Mean (SD) serum amylase at baseline was elevated at 69.2 (30.3) U/L (normal range: 1 to 17 U/L [<6 
months]; 6 to 44 U/L [6 months to 1 year]). The mean (SD) amylase level was 58.8 (27.4) U/L at Week 
24. 
Other Clinical Chemistry Parameters 
For all clinical chemistry parameters (excluding lipase and amylase, which trended downwards), the mean 
changes from baseline were small, and no apparent trends were observed. No subjects had any 
laboratory related AEs. 
Haematology 
For all haematology parameters, the mean changes from baseline were small, and no apparent trends 
were observed. There were no AEs related to haematology parameters.  
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Part A Cohort 3 
Vital Signs and Physical Examinations 
According to the MAH, no clinically significant changes from baseline were observed for BP, pulse rate, 
oxygen saturation, temperature, or respiratory rate.

Part A, Cohort 3, 3-<6 Months 
While the magnitude of changes in vital signs pulse rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, or respiratory 
rate can be taken as minor, changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure are noted. Median systolic BP 
for the Cohort 3 IVA 25 mg group decreased from 114.0 mmHg to 88.0 mmHg during the 5 days of the 
study and decreased from 97 mmHg to 82 mmHg for the Cohort 3 50 mg IVA group. Median diastolic BP 
decreased from 62.5 mmHg to 51 mmHg for the whole Cohort 3 population. Although minimum and 
maximum values for systolic blood pressure were in normal range at baseline and remained largely in it 
at day 5, the minimum of decrease in systolic blood pressure was -30 mmHg in the 50 mg ivacaftor 
group, while -11 mmHg in the 25 mg ivacaftor group. Similarly, for diastolic blood pressure: a -31 mmHg 
the minimum of change was seen in the 50 mg ivacaftor group and -21 mmHg in the 25 mg ivacaftor 
group. Decreased BP values in Study 124 Part A/Cohort 3, were also within the normal range of the 
investigated age group and most likely originate from the known high variability of BP measurements in 
infants. 
Length, weight, weight-for-length, and BMI data for each subject are presented and discussed in Clinical 
efficacy part of this AR. 
Electrocardiograms 
No clinically important trends were identified in changes in ECG findings. No subject had a clinically 
significant abnormal ECG finding during the treatment.

Part B Cohort 7 
Vital Signs and Physical Examinations 
No clinically relevant trends or changes from baseline were observed over the 24-week treatment period 
for pulse rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, or BP.  
There were some variations in the mean BP levels over the course of the study, these were considered as 
small one by the MAH. Abnormal physical examination results were captured as AEs.

Median systolic BP was 91 mmHg at baseline (BL), minimum and maximum BL systolic BP values were 72 
mmHg and 105 mmHg, respectively. At Week 24, median systolic BP was 101.5 mmHg, minimum and 
maximum systolic BP values were 94 mmHg and 107 mmHg, respectively. During the 24 Week of Study 
124 Part B Cohort 7, as high as 130 mmHg systolic blood pressure value was measured as well. Systolic 
blood pressure values above ULN for infants 0 to 12 months of age (normal SBP range 65 to 106 mmHg) 
were measured at almost all visits, but in different patients and not consequently in the same patient. 
Five patients had one or more systolic BP measures during the 24 weeks of Study 124, Part B Cohort 7 
which seem to be higher than the upper level of normal range of systolic BP for infants. All patients had 
diastolic BP values higher than the upper level of normal range of diastolic BP for infants. 
There was high variability in BP measurements in Study 124 due to difficulties in obtaining accurate BP 
measurements in infants 4 to <6 months of age. 
There was one subject in Cohort 7, who had systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mm Hg. The subject’s BP values at 
all other study visits, from screening through Week 24, were within the normal range, or very close to the 
upper limit of normal (ULN) (for infants 0 to 12 months, normal range SBP: 65 to 106 mm Hg; diastolic 
BP [DBP]: 45 to 66 mm Hg). This BP excursion might have been caused by the variability of BP 
measurements in infants. 
Minimal value of oxygen saturation was 96% through Week 24 of Study 124 Part B Cohort 7 and there 
was no patient with consequently lower saturation. 
Electrocardiograms 
No clinically important trends were identified in ECG results. All subjects had a maximum QTcF interval of 
≤450 msec during study treatment. No subjects had an increase in QTcF of >30 msec. There were no 
ECG results that were considered by the investigator to be AEs. 
Ophthalmologic Examination 
No treatment-emergent cataracts (lens opacities) were identified during the 24-week treatment period. 
All subjects had both the screening and the Week 24 OE. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Extrinsic Factors 
A reduction in the IVA dose is recommended for patients ≥6 months of age during co-administration with 
strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
It is expected that patients 4 to <6 months of age may receive therapeutic agents that include strong and 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors during the course of their treatment with IVA. Due to variability in maturation 
of CYP enzymes involved in IVA metabolism, treatment with IVA is not recommended in patients 4 to <6 
months of age who are taking concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, unless the benefits 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 69/83 
 
 
  
  
 
outweigh the risks. In such cases, a reduction in the IVA dose is recommended. The recommended IVA 
dose for patients 4 to <6 months of age and weighing ≥5 kg is 25 mg twice weekly or less frequently 
during concomitant dosing with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Dosing intervals should be modified 
according to the clinical response and tolerability. 
Intrinsic Factors 
Based on the results of Study 124 and Phase 1 Study 013 in adult subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment, a reduction in the IVA dose is recommended in patients ≥6 months of age with moderate 
hepatic impairment. 
Although moderate hepatic impairment is rare in children <6 months of age with CF, such a level of liver 
disease may occur. 
Due to variability in maturation of CYP enzymes involved in IVA metabolism, treatment with IVA is not 
recommended in patients 4 to <6 months of age with hepatic impairment, unless the benefits outweigh 
the risks. In such cases, a reduction in the IVA dose is recommended. The recommended IVA dose for 
patients 4 to <6 months of age and weighing ≥5 kg with hepatic impairment is one 25-mg sachet/packet 
of granules once daily (qd) or less frequently. Dosing intervals should be modified according to the clinical 
response and tolerability. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no AEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation or treatment interruption in Part A 
Cohort 3 as well as in Part B Cohort 7. 
Post marketing experience 
IVA is approved in Australia, Brazil, Canada, EU, Israel, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the 
US. Cumulatively, 6,962 patients (representing 20,054.6 person-years) received at least one dose of IVA 
during the period from the Development International Birth Date of IVA (31 January 2012) to 23 January 
2020. No new safety concerns have been identified based on ongoing post-marketing surveillance data; 
data have been consistent with those from clinical studies and the established safety profile of IVA. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database in the target paediatric population is limited in terms of size and drug exposure. Only 
safety data from 12 children between 4 to 6 months of age from study 124 are available and only 6 of 
them received 25 mg q12h for approximately 24 weeks. This precludes CHMP from fully characterising 
the safety profile from a quantitative point of view as only frequent adverse reactions could be detected. 
However, based on the available data coming from the interim analysis 3 of study 124, ivacaftor seems 
well tolerated with reported AEs that are consistent with those observed in older children.  
In part A/Cohort 3  
There was one serious adverse event (SAE) of thrombocytopenia noted at Day 5. The investigator 
assessed the SAE as not related to study drug and considered omeprazole as the suspected aetiology. 
Thrombocytopenia is a rare but known adverse drug reaction of omeprazole. Thus, the aetiology of the 
thrombocytopenia as an omeprazole-induced one seems to be possible. The assignment of this SAE as 
not related to IVA treatment is thus accepted by CHMP, and also underlined by the fact that the re-
initiation of IVA therapy in Study 126 did not caused a new onset of thrombocytopenia in this patient 
during the 84 week spent by this patient to date in the ongoing Study 126. 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 70/83 
 
 
  
  
There were no deaths, treatment interruptions, or treatment discontinuations. 
There were no notable adverse trends in clinical laboratory or ECG parameters. 
While the magnitude of changes in vital signs pulse rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, or respiratory 
rate is considered to be minor, changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure are noted. Median systolic 
BP for the IVA 25 mg group decreased from 114.0 mmHg to 88.0 mmHg during the 5 days of the study, 
For the Cohort 3 50 mg IVA group decreased from 97 mmHg to 82 mmHg. Median diastolic BP decreased 
from 62.5 mmHg to 51 mmHg for the whole Cohort 3 population. Although minimum and maximum 
values for systolic blood pressure were in normal range at baseline and remained largely in it at day 5, 
the minimum of decrease in systolic blood pressure was -30 mmHg in the 50 mg ivacaftor group, while -
11 mmHg in the 25 mg ivacaftor group. Similarly, for diastolic blood pressure: a -31 mmHg the minimum 
of change was seen in the 50 mg ivacaftor group and -21 mmHg in the 25 mg ivacaftor group. Decreased 
BP values in Study 124 Part A/Cohort 3, were also within the normal range of the investigated age group 
and most likely originate from the known high variability of BP measurements in infants. 
Part B/Cohort 7 
Most AEs were common manifestations of CF for patients in this age group. The most common AEs 
(occurring in 2 or more subjects) included cough, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection. 
All AEs were mild or moderate in severity except for one event of bronchiolitis, assessed as severe. The 
event of bronchiolitis was also an SAE; there were no other SAEs. All AEs, including the SAE of 
bronchiolitis, were considered unlikely related or not related to study drug. 
There were no deaths, treatment interruptions, or treatment discontinuations. 
No subject had elevated alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) or total bilirubin 
during the 24 weeks of treatment. 
No treatment-emergent cataracts (lens opacities) were observed. 
There were no notable adverse trends in clinical laboratory or ECG parameters. 
Rise of systolic and diastolic BP was observed from BL through Week 24 in Part B Cohort 7. Moreover, 
some systolic BP results in 5/6 patients exceeded the upper limit of normal systolic BP range in infants. 
All patients had higher than normal diastolic BP measures as well. However this could be explained by the 
high variability in BP measurements in Study 124 due to difficulties (incuding poor compliance) in 
obtaining accurate BP measurements in infants 4 to <6 months of age. 
In Study 126, there were no pre-planned interim analyses performed until now. Upon CHMP’s request, 
the MAH presented baseline demography, disease characteristics and available safety data on the last 
data cut dated on 10 March 2020. According to these data, majority of patients in Study 126 are White, 
non-Hispanic/Latino and carry mutations G551D/F508del. Safety findings were generally consistent with 
those observed in Study 124 Part A Cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7. 
Most AEs were common manifestations of CF for patients in this age group. Related AEs occurred in 
15.9% of patients. Severe AEs were experienced by 11% of patients. Serious AEs were occurred in 
24.4% of patients, whereas 15.9% of patients had SAEs belonging to Infections and infestations SOC. 
Treatment discontinuation was carried out for 2 patients due to transaminase elevations. Most 
discontinuations were caused not by AEs but by possibility of switching the patient to other, commercially 
already available presentations of Kalydeco. 
Comparison of these safety findings with those from Study 124 Part A/Cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7 
should be handled with caution due to the short duration of Study 124 Part A/Cohort 3 and to the low 
number of patients in both Cohorts of Study 124. Overall, main safety findings in Study 124 Part 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 71/83 
 
 
  
  
B/Cohort 7 and Study 126 seem to be rather similar: remarkable part of AEs and SAEs belonged to the 
Infections and infestations SOC and were the common manifestations/complications of CF. No subjects 
discontinued from Study 124 Part A/Cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7 and 2 patients discontinued due to AEs 
(transaminases increased) from Study 126 up to the last data cut (10 March 2020). Of note, liver enzyme 
elevations resolved upon discontinuation except from one subject for whom it is stated that AST elevation 
was not resolved. This issue will be further evaluated when the final CSR for study 126 will be submitted. 
Other reasons for discontinuation in Study 126 was due to switching of some patient from study product 
to commercially available Kalydeco presentations. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the small sample size, the lack of placebo control and the relative short duration of study 124 
make it difficult to perform a comprehensive safety evaluation of ivacaftor in children with CF aged 4 to 
less than 6 months. However, the available data suggest that the safety profile in the target paediatric 
population is similar to that seen in older children.  
IVA was generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with CF 3 to <6 months of age during the 4 days of 
IVA treatment assessed over 5 days in Part A/Cohort 3, and subjects 4 to <6 months of age during the 
24 weeks of treatment in Part B/Cohort 7. Most AEs were common manifestations of CF for patients in 
this age group and mild or moderate in severity. There were no deaths, treatment interruptions, or 
treatment discontinuations due to AEs. There were no notable adverse trends in clinical laboratory or ECG 
parameters, and no treatment-emergent cataracts (lens opacities). Systolic and diastolic BP showed a 
remarkable decrease during the five days of Study 124 Part A Cohort 3. In Part B Cohort 7, however, rise 
of systolic and diastolic BP was observed from baseline through Week 24. Moreover, some systolic BP 
results in 5/6 patients exceeded the upper limit of normal systolic BP range in infants. All patients had 
higher than normal diastolic BP measures as well, no consistent trend for a suspected AE could be 
assessed. 
The safety results of this study in subjects 3 to <6 months of age (Part A/Cohort 3) and 4 to <6 months 
of age (Part B/Cohort 7) were overall consistent with the safety results from subjects 6 months of age 
and older. There were no new safety concerns. Issues related to BP experienced in Study 124 
PartA/Cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7 were caused most likely by the high variability of BP measurements 
due to difficulties of BP measurements in infants. Some available safety findings obtained from the 
ongoing Study 126 suggest similar safety profile in study 126 compared to that observed in study 124, 
however, final evaluation and conclusion will be performed once final complete CSR will be submitted. The 
product information will be updated as needed.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 10.0 is acceptable.  
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
CF is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and high premature 
mortality. CF affects approximately 30,000 individuals in the US and 48,000 individuals in the EU. CF 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 75/83 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
greatly affects the paediatric population, as approximately half of the total population with CF is <18 
years of age. Pancreatic destruction leading to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency begins in utero, and lung 
involvement, manifested by pulmonary inflammation and infection, begins shortly after birth. While the 
disease affects multiple organs, progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality. Despite 
progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a 
person with CF is 44.4 years. Although the disease affects multiple organs, progressive loss of lung 
function is the leading cause of mortality. 
Studies performed in children diagnosed following newborn screening suggest that early intervention is 
associated to improved outcomes. Therefore, there is an expectation that early treatment in life, 
particularly with the CFTR modulators that target the functional defect of the mutant CFTR protein, may 
translate in slowing disease progression. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is currently no cure available for CF. The goals of current CF therapies are to slow or reverse 
disease progression, manage symptoms and complications such as pancreatic insufficiency and 
respiratory infections, and improve quality of life. The majority of CF therapies currently available, 
including nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics, target the downstream consequences and 
symptoms of the disease. CFTR modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) target the underlying cause 
of CF with the potential to alter the course of the disease. These CFTR modulators are not a cure for CF 
and must be taken chronically for the patient to maintain treatment benefits. 
Kalydeco (ivacaftor), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) and Kaftrio 
(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) are the CFTR modulators currently approved for CF patients.  
Treatment with ivacaftor targets the underlying pathophysiology of CF and improves CFTR function, 
resulting in clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements in ppFEV1, Cystic Fibrosis 
Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain, weight/BMI, and commensurate changes in sweat chloride for 
subjects ≥6 years of age. 
At this time, there is no approved CFTR modulator therapy available for CF patients <6 months of age. An 
approval is sought for the treatment of infants aged at least 4 months, toddlers and children weighing 5 
kg to less than 25 kg with CF who have an R117H mutation or one of the following gating (class III) 
mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or 
S549R. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on results provided for the ongoing open label Study 124 in patients aged <24 
months. Interim (week 24) analysis was submitted in two cohorts (3 and 7) of this study from patients 
aged 3 months to less than 6 months. Results of 6 patients have been provided. 
 These data are supported with efficacy data from previous evaluated studies in older patients as follows:  
- Studies 102, 103, and 111 performed in subjects with gating or R117H mutation in at least one allele of 
CFTR gene (≥6 years of age).  
- Study 108 (uncontrolled open label study) in subjects 2 through 5 years of age. 
- Studies 105, 112 and 109 (OL-long term studies) in subjects ≥6 years of age and in subjects 2 through 
5 years of age, respectively (Study 109). 
- Registry studies: Long-term Safety Study (US and UK CF registries). 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020

The previously above studies support the current submission as data can be partially extrapolated  
The lack of randomisation from open label studies limits conclusion, however, extrapolation of efficacy 
from adults, adolescents and children of other age groups is accepted as the pathophysiology of the 
underlying disease and the mechanism of action of ivacaftor is the same. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Interim analysis of cohort A and B of study 124 demonstrated the ability of ivacaftor to increase CFTR 
function in subjects 4 to <6 months, as evidenced by substantial decreases in sweat chloride 
concentration in Study 124.The data are limited to 6 patients aged 4 months and less than 6 months.  
The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was -34.0 (mmol/L (n = 1) at week 2, 
65.6 (12.0) mmol/L (n = 5) at week 12, and -50.0 (17.3) mmol/L (n = 3) at week 24. These data are 
comparable to that previously observed with ivacaftor treatment in other children and adolescents. This 
‑
provides additional support for extrapolation of efficacy from the older population to the younger patients 
from 4 months of age. The mean nutritional parameters were normal at baseline, but below the median 
of the reference population, and increased during the 24 weeks of ivacaftor treatment. Mean absolute 
changes from baseline were: weight, +2.5 kg; length, +9.3 cm, weight-for-length percentile, +20.0%; 
normalized mean changes were: weight-for-age z-score, +0.82; length-for-age z-score, +0.56; and 
weight-for-length-for-age z-score, +0.68. Mean increases in Faecal Elastase-1 (FE-1) were observed by 
week 2 and sustained through Week 24. The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in FE-1 at week 
24 was 181.0 (122.9) μg/g (n = 4), suggesting improvement in pancreatic function with ivacaftor 
treatment. Three subjects were pancreatic insufficient (FE-1 values ≤200 μg/g) at baseline. These 3 
subjects had FE-1 values >200 μg/g at week 24 (n = 2) or at the last available FE-1 assessment, week 
12 (n = 1). Absolute mean change (SD) from baseline in IRT at week 24 was -593.8 (402.5) ng/mL (n = 
4). This decrease was comparable that seen in previous age groups of children in study 124.  
Results from Study 108 previously evaluated demonstrated that ivacaftor improves CFTR function in 
subjects 2 through 5 years of age, resulting in positive effects on nutritional status and pancreatic 
function. 
Sustained, long-term benefits of IVA treatment were demonstrated in clinical studies of ivacaftor in 
subjects ≥6 years of age (Studies 105 and 112) and in subjects 2 through 5 years of age (Study 109). 
Furthermore, in the Long-term Safety Study lower risks for death, organ transplantation, hospitalizations, 
PEx, and serious safety outcomes in IVA-treated patients relative to untreated comparators were 
observed up to 5 years of follow up.  
Overall, based on the above data in young patients from 4 months of age supported by efficacy data in 
older patients, the CHMP considered that the clinical benefits of ivacaftor has been sufficiently 
demonstrated in children from 4 months to less than 6 months.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Initially, Cohort 7 was planned to include children aged 0-6 months. In part A, one subject who received 
25 mg q12h ivacaftor had an AUC value above the 95th percentile of that observed in the adult 
population, suggesting that IVA exposures may be impacted by maturation at this age. To ensure IVA 
exposure did not exceed the targeted adult range (95th percentile), Part B/Cohort 7 was limited to 
subjects 4 to <6 months of age, weighing ≥5 kg.  
PK and efficacy data are provided in 6 patients aged 4 months to less than 6 months. The level of 
evidence of an interim analysis in two cohorts of an open-label study is limited. The benefit of ivacaftor 
treatment (on sweat chloride) may be further supported in this age range by positive effects on

pancreatic exocrine function and evidence of acutely reduced pancreatic inflammation/injury, as well as 
maintained generally normal (or even improve below normal) nutritional status, as measured by growth 
parameters. Results were generally encouraging and generally consistent with that observed in the 6-
month-old through 5-year-old population.  
The duration of study is rather short and there is uncertainty whether the improvement is maintained.  
Through week 24, all growth parameter increased however, due to the lack of control group these results 
are difficult to interpret. The consistency observed in all parameters measured is nevertheless reassuring.  
Regarding faecal calprotectin levels, results may be indicative of reduction of inflammation, however, 
elevated faecal calprotectin naturally declines from birth to its nadir at 4 years and therefore the 
interpretation of the above results is confounded by this issue in the absence of a control group. The very 
similar consideration applies for IRT levels. Based on FE-1 levels (with a cut-off at 200 μg/g), the MAH 
states that some children became pancreatic sufficient. However, all patients received pancreatic enzyme 
substitution at baseline (N=5) continued substitution therapy through week 24. Data beyond 24 weeks of 
treatment are needed to confirm that the results in FE-1, IRT etc. would be maintained.  
The effect of discontinuing prescribed therapies for CF while remaining on ivacaftor treatment has not 
been evaluated. During Study 124, subjects continued on their prescribed CF therapies. 
Lung function correlates with mortality in CF patients. Spirometry cannot be performed in these very 
young children; pulmonary function decrease cannot be seen at this age and LCI/IPFM was not measured 
in this age cohort. Results on pulmonary exacerbation and microbiological cultures did not show any 
consequent trend, however, this cannot be expected in a short-term study including patients that have 
generally low PEx and colonisation rates. Long-term data are needed in these young patients to establish 
a beneficial effect of ivacaftor on lung function and microbiological endpoints and to confirm positive 
results on nutrition in this age group. 
Based on the mechanism of action of ivacaftor and clinical experience in older patients, tolerance is not 
expected to develop in patients with CF 4 to <6 months of age. However, the duration of study is rather 
short and there is uncertainty whether the improvement is maintained. Further data are expected to be 
provided when the final results for study 126 will be available in order to assess maintenance of effect 
over time. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety results in subjects 4 to <6 months in Study 124 were generally consistent with those in older 
population, with no new safety concerns identified. In Part A/Cohort 3, there was one event of 
thrombocytopenia at Day 5, considered unrelated to study drug and for which a negative IVA re-challenge 
was observed in the Extension study 126. In part B/Cohort 7, the most common AEs (occurring in 2 or 
more subjects) included cough, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection. Otitis media, constipation, 
diarrhoea and vomiting occurred as well. There was also one event of bronchiolitis considered not related 
to study drug. 
BP changes observed during Part A in Cohort 3 and Part B in Cohort 7 as well as outlier BP values should 
be interpreted with caution because of the known difficulties in BP measure methodology as well as the 
low sample size. According to the MAH's, the BP issues were caused by the high variability of BP 
measurements in infants due to some difficulties (including poor compliance) of BP measurement in this 
age group. This can be endorsed by CHMP. 
Overall the safety profile of ivacaftor has been well characterised since approval in older patients 
populations. Adverse drug reactions identified from previously completed studies include nasopharyngitis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/530990/2020 
Page 78/83 
 
 
  
  
upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasal congestion, oropharyngeal pain, rash, abdominal pain, 
and diarrhoea. Most of these ADRs are mild to moderate in severity and resolved with continued ivacaftor 
treatment. Other potential risk includes elevated transaminase, drug-drug interactions, and cataract (lens 
opacities). These risks are managed through product information, including recommendation of close 
monitoring of liver function including elevations in transaminase levels until resolution. Furthermore, dose 
adjustments are required when IVA is used concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors. In 
addition, baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients 
treated with IVA.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The changes observe in BP during Part A in Cohort 3 and Part B in Cohort 7 should be interpreted with 
caution as BP measurement in infants can be challenging. 
Overall, the low sample size, the uncontrolled design of the study and the short duration of Part B are 
limitations to the characterisation of the safety profile in patients from 4 months of age. All patients from 
Part B continued in Extension study 126. The interim safety findings obtained from Study 126 were 
generally comparable with those seen in Study 124 Part A/cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7. The safety of 
long-term ivacaftor treatment in subjects 4 to <6 months is being evaluated in the 96-week open-label 
extension Study 126, and final results of which are due in March 2022. This will allow characterisation of 
the safety profile in this young patient population

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A clear demonstration of efficacy in these very young children (4 to less than 6 months) is hampered by 
the absence of endpoints that are sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in response to treatment. Lung 
disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis. However, in very young children 
with preserved lung function conventional tests (such as spirometry) are not sufficiently sensitive. 
Alternative tests such as the Lung Clearance Index (LCI) or imaging techniques (e.g., CT scan) would be 
required to detect the initial changes in lung function or the structural changes present in the lung since 
birth. Each of these present their own problems such as the potential need for sedation, the requirement 
for specific equipment and training (LCI) or the risk of radiation (CT scan). Pulmonary exacerbations, a 
clinically relevant endpoint in older subjects with cystic fibrosis, is not of help either to assess response to 
treatment as very young children (usually) experience a limited number of these events. In addition, 
showing that disease progression is halted requires a prolonged period of follow-up that cannot be 
performed pre-authorisation, particularly when data are available supporting the beneficial effect of 
ivacaftor in older subjects.  
Given that in very young children the most prominent features of the disease are those of the 
gastrointestinal tract, demonstration of a favourable effect on nutritional status and pancreatic function 
would be supportive as surrogate for the benefit of treatment. Interim results from Study 124 
demonstrated that ivacaftor improves CFTR function in infants aged 4 to less than 6 months who have a 
mutation that causes CFTR gating defects in line with the ivacaftor indication, with a clear positive effect 
on sweat chloride. Final results of Study 124 along with individual data are not yet available for all 
children enrolled in Part B of the study and will provide further long-term efficacy and safety data in the 
paediatric CF population.    
No new AEs were identified in Cohorts 3 or 7 of study 124 and the safety profile was consistent with that 
known for older patients with class III gating mutation for whom data on long term safety data are 
available.  
Safety findings from study 126 that were provided by the MAH upon request form CHMP, were generally 
consistent with those observed in Study 124 Part A Cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7 which is reassuring. The 
final CSR of study 126 will be completed in 2022. 
However, the safety database in the target paediatric population remains limited in terms of size and drug 
exposure, i.e., only safety data from 6 children between 4 and <6 months of age from study 124 are 
available and only 6 out of them were treated for approximately 24 weeks with ivacaftor 50 mg q12h. 
This precludes to properly characterising the safety profile in this very young population from a 
quantitative point of view as only frequent adverse reactions could be detected.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Cystic fibrosis represents an area of unmet medical need for specific targeted therapies. Study 124 is an 
uncontrolled study with safety and PK as primary endpoints, the 3rd interim analysis results demonstrated 
that ivacaftor improves CFTR function in subjects aged 4 to <6 months who have a mutation that causes 
CFTR gating defects, with positive effects on sweat chloride. Results on nutritional status and pancreatic 
function that are very relevant in this age group and may be supportive for a positive benefit/risk. 
According to ICH E11 (Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population) “when a 
medicinal product is to be used in younger paediatric patients for the same indication(s) as those studied 
in older paediatric patients, the disease process is similar, and the outcome of therapy is likely to be 
comparable, extrapolation of efficacy from older to younger paediatric patients may be possible. In such 
cases, pharmacokinetic studies in the relevant age groups of paediatric patients likely to receive the 
medicinal product, together with safety studies, may be sufficient to provide adequate information for 
paediatric use.” Although the underlying defect in cystic fibrosis is the same across all ages, the 
heterogeneity of disease effects in target organs and the progression of the disease over time lead to 
clinical manifestations that vary according to age. The implementation of newborn screening programmes 
has shown that early interventions such as nutritional support, eradication of early lung 
colonisation/infection etc. are associated to improved health outcomes and quality of life. It can be 
assumed that drugs targeting the basic defect of the mutant CFTR protein cystic fibrosis such as CFTR 
modulators may have the potential to slow disease progression and earlier treatment would result in 
better outcomes.  
The safety database provided is limited both in terms of size and length of exposure and this has an 
obvious impact on the characterisation of the safety profile of ivacaftor in these young children. However, 
it is reassuring that no new AEs had been identified in study 124 compared to what it is already known 
for older patients with class III gating mutations. Furthermore, safety data from study 126 were 
consistent with those from Study 124 Part A/Cohort 3 and Part B/Cohort 7, and the final study report will 
provide additional safety data for 96 weeks. The final CSR of study 126 will be provided upon completion 
in 2022, as stated in the RMP. 
Based on the principles of paediatric extrapolation, the benefits of ivacaftor treatment can be extended to 
patients between 4 to <6 months of age and with all approved mutations.   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
For subjects 2 through 5 years of age a PAES is ongoing to address whether starting treatment at the age 
of two years may have an impact on disease progression. It was agreed by the CHMP that for children 
below 2 years of age a similar PAES cannot be feasible due to the small number of available children in 
this age group. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kalydeco is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
Assessment report

4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The 
RMP is updated accordingly (version 10.0). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0353/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Bronchitol, TOBY Podhaler, Symkevi and Kaftrio 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

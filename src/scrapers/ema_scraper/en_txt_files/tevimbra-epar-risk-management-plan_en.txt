Tevimbra 
Centralized Procedure 
Chemical class: Tislelizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 
variant monoclonal antibody (mAb). 
Summary of mode of action: Tislelizumab binds to the extracellular 
domain  of  human  programmed  cell  death  protein  (PD)-1  with  high 
specificity and affinity. Tislelizumab competitively blocks the binding of 
both programmed cell death ligand (PD-L) -1 and PD-L2, thus inhibiting 
PD-1 mediated negative signaling and enhancing the functional activity 
in T-cells at the site of the tumor. 
Important  information  about  its  composition:  Concentrate  for 
solution for infusion. The solution has a pH of approximately 6.5 and an 
osmolality  of  approximately  270 to  330 mOsm/kg.  Tislelizumab  is 
produced  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary  cells  by  recombinant  DNA 
technology. 
[Proposed SmPC] 
Current: Tevimbra, as monotherapy, is indicated for the treatment of 
adult  patients  with  unresectable  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (ESCC)  after  prior  platinum-
based chemotherapy. 
Proposed (if applicable): Not applicable 
Dosage in the EEA 
Current:  200 mg administered as an  intravenous (i.v.) infusion every 
3 weeks. 
Proposed (if applicable): Not applicable 
Pharmaceutical form(s) 
and strengths 
Current  (if  applicable):  100 mg/10 mL  (10 mg/mL)  concentrate  for 
solution for infusion 
Proposed (if applicable): Not applicable 
Is/will the product be

Part  II  Safety  specification  Module  SI:  Epidemiology  of  the 
indication(s) and target population 
2.1 
Indication: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
Esophageal carcinoma (EC) was the seventh most common cancer worldwide in 2020, with an 
estimated 604000 new cases (3.1% of all cancers), and the sixth leading cause of all cancer 
deaths,  with  544000 deaths  (5.5%  of  all  cancer  mortality),  based  on  the  GLOBOCAN 
2020 database (Sung et al 2021). Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant type 
of EC accounting for approximately 87% of all EC cases globally (Uhlenhopp et al 2020). The 
geographic distribution of ESCC however, varies greatly, with more than 10-fold differences 
between countries. Over the last 40 years there have been large changes in the incidence in the 
different types of esophageal cancers, and these trends are region specific. In the US, Europe, 
Australia, and many other Western countries, the incidence of ESCC had been decreasing for 
several decades, whereas the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased. In Eastern 
Europe, Japan, and South America, ESCC still predominates. In most of Asia and Sub-Saharan 
Africa, ECs occur almost exclusively as ESCCs (Abnet et al 2018). 
Incidence 
In  Europe,  the  age-adjusted  incidence  rate  (IR)  of  EC  as  estimated  from  the  GLOBOCAN 
database, was 3.3 per 100000 in 2020 (Ferlay et al 2020). In a recent publication also using the 
GLOBOCAN database, the age-adjusted IRs of ESCC per 100000 in 2018 by European region, 
were  as  follows:  Eastern  Europe 2.5,  Western  Europe 2.3,  Northern  Europe 1.8,  Southern 
Europe 1.3 (Arnold et al 2020). Additionally, Rumgay et al (2021a) used the Cancer Incidence 
in  Five  Continents  Plus  (CI5Plus)  database  of  population-based  cancer  registry  data  and 
multiple subnational cancer registries, to examine EC subtype incidence patterns in 27 countries. 
In  European  countries,  for  years  2003-2012,  the  age-standardized  IR  of  ESCC ranged  from 
0.9 to 3.0 per 100000,  the  highest  being  within  Eastern  and  Central  Europe  in  Slovakia 
(3.0 per 100000)  and  the  lowest  within  Northern  Europe  in  Norway  (0.9 per 100000).  The 
proportion of ESCC cases of total EC in that European country ranged from 30% to 77% with 
the highest in Slovakia (77%), followed by Slovenia (70%) and the lowest, within the EU27, in 
The  Netherlands  (31%),  followed  by  Norway  (37%).  Table 21  shows  the  ESCC  cases,  the 
proportion of total EC cases, and the ESCC age-adjusted IR per 100000 persons by population 
from  2003 to 2012  (Rumgay et al 2021b).  Additionally,  based  on  the  analysis  of  data  from 
Czech National Cancer Registry, Kroupa et al (2020) reported an age-adjusted IR of ESCC as 
1.67 per 100000 from 2013 to 2017.

In  the  US,  a  recent,  retrospective  analyses  of  Surveillance,  Epidemiology,  and  End  Results 
identified  13919 ESCC  cases  with  an 
(SEER) database  for 
age-adjusted IR of 1.9 per 100000 (Then et al 2020). In Canada, a nationwide population-based 
study  conducted 
identified  9115 ESCC cases  with  a  reported  annual 
age-adjusted IR  of  1.04 per 100000  (Cattelan et al 2020).  This  is  slightly  higher  than  the 
the  period  2004-2015,

age-adjusted IR of 0.9 per 100000 later reported by Rumgay et al (2021a) based on regional 
registry data from 2003 to 2012. 
In  the  rest  of  the  world,  a  recent  analysis  of  the  Cancer  Incidence  in  Five  Continents  plus 
Volume X (CI5X)  database  estimated  the  age-adjusted  IR  per 100000  for  Eastern-,  South-
Central-  and  Western  Asian  countries  for  15 to  30 years.  The  highest  age-adjusted  IR  was 
reported in Japan as 5.6 for the years 1988-2010, followed by India as 3.6 for 1983-2012, China 
as 3.0 for 1998-2012, Republic of Korea as 2.5 for 1998-2012 and Turkey as 1.1 for 1998-2012 
(Rumgay et al 2021b). 
Prevalence 
Published population-based studies on the prevalence of ESCC are lacking. 
Only  1 study  in  the  US  was  identified,  reporting  a  40-year  prevalence  of  ESCC  of

analysis of the SEER database from 1973 to 2015 (He et al 2020). In Table 2-2, estimates of 
EC prevalence proportion and counts in the year 2020, worldwide, EU27 and for Europe, as the

The worldwide 5-year prevalence proportion of EC was 0.85 per 10000. The EU-27 prevalence 
proportion was 0.84 per 10000 (Ferlay et al 2020). Prevalence was lowest in Southern Europe 
(0.50 per 10000) and Central/Eastern Europe (0.62 per 10000) while the highest was in Western 
Europe  (1.17 per 10000)  followed  by  Northern  Europe  (0.92 per 10000).  These  differences 
partially reflect differences in the underlying incidence of EC, but also reflect differences in 
risk factor prevalence (and shifts in risk factor prevalence), relative changes in the incidence of 
squamous cell carcinomas relative to adenocarcinomas, as well as access to and types of health 
care interventions and other factors that in turn impact survivorship. 
Demographics of the population in the authorized indication – age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease 
The  mean  age  of  ESCC  was  66.3 ± 10  years  based  on  SEER  data  of  13919 ESCC  patients 
between 2004-2015 (Then et al 2020). Similarly, the mean age at diagnosis was reported as

68.3 ± 1.1 years in a nationwide Canadian study conducted between 1992-2010. In that study, 
the  age-adjusted  IR  of  ESCC  increased  with  age:  for  age  <30 years  the  incidence  was 
0.0 per 100000,  increasing  gradually  until  ages  60-69  (4.2 per 100000)  and  peaking  at  ages 
70-79 (7.1 per 100000) (Cattelan et al 2020).
Globally, the IRs of ESCC are higher in men as compared to women. In 2012, the IR of ESCC 
was 7.7 per 100000 in men and 2.8 per 100000 in women. The global male to female ratio was 
reported as 2.7 per 100000 with substantial geographical variations; it was highest in Eastern 
Europe (7.8 per 100000) and lowest in Northern Africa and Western Asia (1.2 per 100000). The 
estimates were based on a study by Arnold et al (2015) analyzing data from Cancer Incidence 
in Five Continents Vol. X (CI5X) and GLOBOCAN 2012. 
It has been reported that the frequency of ESCC varies substantially depending on race/ethnicity 
and geographical region. About 80% of the global ESCC cases (corresponding to 315000 cases) 
occurred in the Central and South-East Asian region. China alone contributed more than half of 
the  global  cases  (53%  or  210000 cases).  The  reported  age-adjusted IR  per  100000  was  the 
highest in Eastern/South-East Asia at 13.6 per 100000 in men and 4.3 per 100000 in women, 
the  same  data  source, 
followed  by  sub-Saharan  Africa  and  Central  Asia.  Using 
Malhotra et al (2017) reported the highest ESCC age-adjusted IR per 100000 in Asia (9.6 in 
men and 4.4 in women) and the lowest age-adjusted IR per 100000 in North America (1.2 in 
men and 0.8 in women). Europe and Oceania reported the same low incidence among women 
as North America (0.8 per 100000). 
Regarding  risk  factors,  smoking  and  alcohol  consumption  and  particularly  their  synergistic 
effect,  are  well-established  risk  factors  for  ESCC.  The  adjusted  odds  ratio  (OR)  for  current 
smokers and ever drinkers was reported as 2.2 (95% CI: 1.6-2.92); p value of interaction=0.003 
(Yang et al 2017). Other risk factors include age (ESCC incidence increases with age, mean age 
at diagnosis in the US is 68 years), sex (males have higher incidence than females), race (Blacks 
have higher incidence than Caucasians), low socio-economic status and rural area, consumption 
of  very  hot  beverages/foods  and  exposure  to  nitrosamines  (Uhlenhopp et al 2020).  A  recent 
meta-analysis  of  studies  investigating  cooking  fuel  and  ESCC  among  16189 participants, 
reported that use of biomass fuel for cooking and or heating increased the risk of ESCC (pooled 
OR 3.02; 95% CI: 2.2-4.1) (Okello et al 2019). 
The main existing treatment options 
Neoadjuvant  chemoradiation  in  combination  with  surgery  is  recommended  for  patients  with 
resectable  tumors,  and  definitive  chemoradiation  (dCRT)  is  recommended  for  patients  who 
decline  surgery  or  have  unresectable  locally  advanced  tumors.  Patients  with  advanced 
(metastatic, non-resectable, or recurrent) ESCC are treated with palliative chemotherapy and/or 
localized  treatments,  such  as  radiotherapy  or  stents  (Lordick  et  al  2016).  Platinum-based

Chemotherapy has significant toxicity with substantial morbidity and mortality for patients and 
frequent treatment interruptions, delays, and dose reductions that increase the risk of disease 
progression.  Docetaxel  is  associated  with  grade 3  or  4 neutropenia  (32.6-48.8%),  febrile 
neutropenia  (6.1-20.9%),  anemia  (2.3-9.1%),  anorexia  (3.0-4.7%),  and  pneumonia (4.5%) 
(Shirakawa et al 2014, Mizota et al 2011). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) with paclitaxel 
include 
fatigue (9.4%), 
constipation (7.5%), pneumonia (7.5%), and sensory neuropathy (5.7%). Sensory neuropathy 
of any grade is observed in 81.1% of patients treated with paclitaxel and often is debilitating 
(Muro  et  al  2004,  Kato  et  al  2011).  Irinotecan  often  results  in  neutropenia (21.4%), 
anemia (28.6%),  and  diarrhea (57.1%)  (Burkart et al 2007).  Chemotherapy-related  toxicities 
can severely limit patient function and often result in emergency room visits, hospitalizations, 
and death.

More recently immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have further 
shaped  the  treatment  landscape  for  patients  with  ESCC.  Programmed  cell  death  protein-1 
inhibitors  have  demonstrated  survival  improvement  over  chemotherapy  in  advanced  or 
metastatic  ESCC patients  with  disease  progression  after  prior  systemic 
therapies 
(Kojima et al 2019,  Kato  et  al  2019).  Pembrolizumab  was  approved  by  Food  and  Drug 
Administration (FDA) in Jul-2019 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic 
ESCC but only in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10) 
as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression after 1 or more prior lines of 
systemic therapy. Nivolumab was approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA, 
in  Nov-2020  and  Jun-2020,  respectively,  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  unresectable 
advanced,  recurrent,  or  metastatic  ESCC  after  prior  fluoropyrimidine-  and  platinum-based 
chemotherapy  regardless  of  PD-L1  level.  Nivolumab  was  approved  by  EMA  and  FDA  in 
Jul-2021 and May-2021, respectively, for adjuvant treatment of completely resected esophageal 
or  gastroesophageal  junction  cancer  with  residual  pathologic  disease  in  patients  who  have 
received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity 
Esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  is  characterized  by  a  poor  prognosis  from  the  time  of 
diagnosis, despite advances in treatments (Uhlenhopp et al 2020). 
In Europe, the 1-year relative survival (RS) was reported to be 33.9% (95% CI: 33.3-34.6) and 
the 5-year RS was reported at 10.1% (95% CI: 9.7-10.6), based on a study that utilized cancer 
survival data for patients diagnosed in 1995-1999 with follow up to the end of 2003, collected 
in  24 European  countries  based  on  EUROCARE-4  data 
from  66 cancer  registries 
(Gavin et al 2012). 
Among  13919 patients  with  ESCC,  the  most  common  stage  of  presentation  (about  27%  of 
patients) was Stage IV. The 1-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) was reported to be 43.8% 
and  the  5-year  CSS  was  18.9%,  with  a  median  survival  time  of  10-months.  Significant 
predictors for worse outcomes were African American race, location of lesions in the lower 
esophagus, tumor grade 3 and tumor Stage IV and lack of surgery treatment, based on SEER 
data  during  2004-2015  (Then et al 2020).  Another  recent  US  study  based  on  SEER  data 
identified 6890 ESCC patients from 2007-2015. It was reported that OS differed by sex, with a 
higher 5-year OS in females (19.2%) compared with males (12.9%). The median survival time 
was  longer  for  females  (12 months)  than  for  males  (9 months).  However,  in  ESCC  patients 
≥80 years, 5-year OS did not differ by sex (Li et al 2021). 
A  nationwide  population-based  study  in  Sweden  evaluated  the  prognosis  of  ESCC  among 
patients who underwent surgery, and in those who did not, from 1990-2013. In patients who 
did not undergo surgery, the 1-year and 5-year OS and RS improved during the study period; 
the  5-year  OS  increased  from  2%  (95%  CI:  1.0-3.0)  in  the  period  1990-1994  up  to  5% 
(95% CI: 3.0-7.0) in the period 2010-2013. An improvement was also reported for 5-year RS 
from  3%  (95%  CI: 1.0-4.0)  in  1990-1994  to  6%  (95% CI:  4.0-8.0)  in  2010-2013 
(Kauppila et al 2018).

Part II Safety specification Module SIII: Clinical trial exposure 
4.1 
Part II Module SIII Clinical trial exposure 
Tislelizumab was studied in 1 indication as mentioned below: 
Tislelizumab, as monotherapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (≥18 years of age) 
with unresectable recurrent locally advanced or metastatic ESCC after prior systemic therapy. 
The safety analysis of patients receiving tislelizumab is based primarily on the pivotal study, 
BGB-A317-302 (Study 302), which compared tislelizumab with chemotherapy in patients with 
ESCC. Safety data from the use of tislelizumab in patients with ESCC in other clinical trials 
and safety data from clinical trials evaluating tislelizumab in multiple tumor types are provided 
as supportive information. 
Pivotal Study 302 population 
The  pivotal  Study 302  population  includes  ESCC  patients  who  received  ≥1  dose  of  either 
tislelizumab  200 mg  once  every  3 weeks 
(Tislelizumab  arm  –  255 patients)  or 
investigator-chosen  chemotherapy  (ICC  arm  -  240 patients).  The  safety  analysis  results  of 
ICC patient population are not discussed in the RMP. The study population included patients 
with  advanced  unresectable  or  metastatic  ESCC  that  had  progressed  during  or  after  prior 
systemic therapy, and patients whose disease progressed during treatment of or within 6 months 
of cessation of neo-adjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy or definitive chemoradiation. This patient 
population was eligible for treatment with single-agent chemotherapy. 
All Doses All Indications Population 
The All Dose All Indication population included patients from clinical studies in which patients 
received  tislelizumab  monotherapy.  The  goal  of  this  pooled  analysis  was  to  provide  a 
comprehensive  safety  profile  for  tislelizumab  and  to  provide  supportive  data  for  the  safety 
profile of tislelizumab in a larger population, as well as to identify possible rare safety signals. 
The  analysis  of  this  population  reflects  the  full  experience  with  tislelizumab  in  advanced 
cancers, including ESCC. 
This  integrated  safety  population  included  1972 patients  with  different  tumor  types  who 
received  ≥1 dose  of  tislelizumab  monotherapy.  The  pivotal  Study 302  and  the  6 supportive 
studies included in this analysis are summarized in Table 4-1.

The hepatic impairment status at baseline was determined by the baseline total bilirubin and AST value according 
to the criterion below. Patients with missing baseline total bilirubin or AST (if any) would be considered and 
reported as “Missing” for hepatic impairment status. 
Total bilirubin: Normal ≤ULN; Mild (Scenario 1): ≤ULN, Mild (Scenario 2): >1 to 1.5xULN; Moderate: >1.5 to 
3xULN; Severe: >3xULN. 
Aspartate aminotransferase: Normal ≤ULN; Mild Scenario 1: >ULN, Mild Scenario 2: Any; Moderate: Any; 
Severe: Any 
The renal impairment status at baseline was determined by the estimated GFR (ml/min) according to the criterion 
below. The estimated GFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation with serum creatinine at baseline, sex, 
race and age at baseline for patients in the Tislelizumab Monotherapy Safety Analysis Set and the Cockcroft-
Gault equation with serum creatinine, age and weight at baseline for patients in the Tislelizumab Combination 
Therapy Safety Analysis Set. Patients with missing serum creatinine at baseline (if any) would be considered and 
reported as “Missing” for renal impairment status. 
Renal Impairment status (eGFR [mL/min or mL/min/1.73m2]): 
Normal: ≥90; Mild impairment: 60 to <90; Moderate impairment: 30 to <60; Severe impairment: 15 to <30; 
End state: <15. 
The statistical outputs for tislelizumab were generated to support 2 indications – NSCLC and ESCC. Hence, the 
footnote of all exposure tables in Annex 7 refers to data from both monotherapy and combination therapy studies. 
However, as detailed in Part II Module SII Clinical trial exposure, the data for ESCC population is derived from 
only monotherapy studies (302, 001, 102, 203, 204, 208, 303).

Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
Commonly misused classes of prescription drugs include opioid pain relievers, stimulants, and 
CNS depressants (sedatives and tranquilizers). There is minimal potential for misuse for illegal 
purposes as tislelizumab is an infused product only administered by a healthcare professional 
(HCP) in a healthcare setting. 
Tislelizumab does not share characteristics with drugs that have recognized misuse potential 
and is not deemed to have misuse potential.

By  disrupting  PD1-mediated  signaling,  tislelizumab  acts  to  restore  anti-tumor 
immunity  and  halt  progression  of  tumor  growth.  This  restoration  of  immune 
system activity may result in imARs involving one or more body systems, which 
can be life-threatening or fatal in rare cases (SmPC). The risk should be managed 
by the guidance listed in the tislelizumab SmPC. 
Overall, the benefit-risk balance is positive given the clinical efficacy associated 
with the use of the product and the severity of the diseases. The risk should be 
managed by the guidance listed in the tislelizumab SmPC.

Based  on  the  mechanism  of  action,  the  administration  of  tislelizumab  during 
pregnancy could cause harm to the fetus (SmPC). Pregnant women should be 
advised of the potential risk to the fetus. Women of child-bearing potential should 
use  effective  contraception during treatment  with  tislelizumab  and  for  at  least 
4 months after the last dose of tislelizumab.

Part  II  Module  SVII.3.1.  Presentation  of  important  identified  risks  and 
important potential risks 
The data presented in this EU RMP are based on a population of 1972 patients treated with 
tislelizumab  monotherapy  in  Study 302,  Study 001,  Study 102,  Study 203,  Study 204, 
Study 208, and Study 303. As discussed in Part II Module SIII – Clinical Trial Exposure, the 
total person time of exposure to date for all patients for ESCC indication who have received 
tislelizumab is 1547.63 patient-months. 
For the immune-mediated identified and potential risks, the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms (PTs) listed in Annex 7-Listing 1.1 were used to identify 
immune-mediated  events.  The  methodology  for  diagnostic  evaluation  and 
potential 
management of imAEs was based on American Society of Clinical Oncology and European 
Society  for  Medical  Oncology  guidelines  (Brahmer et al 2018,  Haanen et al 2017).  Potential 
imAEs  included  treatment-emergent  AEs (TEAEs)  that  started  on  or  after  the  first  dose  of 
tislelizumab and required treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants 
treatment or endocrine therapy for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism events. Additionally, 
in order to determine which TEAEs are imAEs, medical reviewers performed an adjudication 
to rule out clear alternative aetiologies of potential imAE cases.

Important Identified Risk: Immune-mediated adverse reactions 
The clinical trial data including incidence, severity and nature of risk, SAEs, and outcome of 
SAEs are summarized in Table 8-5. Other important details including potential mechanisms, 
evidence  sources,  characterization  of  the  risk,  risk  factors  and  risk  groups,  preventability, 
impact on the benefic-risk balance of the product and public health impact are summarized in

Details 
The  use  of  mAbs  that  block  co-inhibitory  immune  checkpoint  molecules,  such  as 
tislelizumab, may serve to increase a baseline T-cell-specific immune response that 
enhances the immune anti-tumor response. However, disruption of the functioning 
of immune checkpoint molecules can lead to imbalances in immunologic tolerance 
that  result  in  an  unchecked  immune  response.  This  may  clinically  manifest  as 
autoimmune-like/inflammatory  side-effects,  which  cause  collateral  damage  to 
normal  organ  systems  and  tissues  (Naidoo  et  al  2015).  However,  the  exact 
pathogenesis  of  immune  toxicity  is  not  clear,  and  many  other  inflammatory  cells, 
such as Th17 and other types of cells, are reported to be involved (Puzanov et al 
2017).

immune-mediated  pancreatitis,  and  other  immune-mediated  reactions)  represent 
sufficient evidence of a causal association with tislelizumab exposure. 
Immune-mediated pneumonitis 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  inflammation  in  lungs  was  observed  in 
cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once 
every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data:  The  most  common  lung  toxicity  observed  in patients  receiving  ICI 
treatment is pneumonitis. Reports of pneumonitis were documented in 2% to 4% of 
patients,  with  1%  to  2%  of  patients  having  grade ≥3  events,  frequency  of  fatal 
pneumonitis in 0.2% of patients and discontinuation due to pneumonitis in 0.2% to 
4% of patients (Haanen et al 2017). 
Immune-mediated hepatitis 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  hepatic  inflammation  was  observed  in 
cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once 
every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical data: Although infrequently observed, the occurrence of immune-mediated 
hepatitis is well established in patients treated with ICIs. These patients are typically 
asymptomatic, and diagnosis is made due to elevated liver enzymes such as ALT 
and/or AST, and occasionally hyperbilirubinemia. The median onset of transaminase 
elevation  is  approximately  6  to  14 weeks  after  starting  ICI treatment,  and  the 
incidence of developing immune-mediated hepatitis in patients treated with ICIs is 
approximately 5% (Puzanov et al 2017). 
Immune-mediated skin adverse reaction 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  skin  rash  was  observed  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys  following  i.v.  infusion  at  doses  of  3,  10,  30,  or  60 mg/kg  (once  every  2 
weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data:  Skin  AEs  are  among  the  most  frequent  AEs  observed  in patients 
treated with mAbs inhibiting either immune checkpoints CTLA4 (ipilimumab in 43% 
to  45%  of  the patients)  or  PD-1  (nivolumab  and  pembrolizumab  in  approximately 
34% of the patients). However, serious skin AEs are rare and do not usually require 
dose reductions or treatment discontinuation (Haanen et al 2017). 
Immune-mediated colitis 
Nonclinical data: No treatment-related diarrhea or gastrointestinal tract inflammation 
was observed in cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 10, 30, 
or 60 mg/kg (once every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical data: Diarrhea and colitis are more frequent with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-
associated protein 4 (CTLA4) agents (e.g., ipilimumab) than with anti-PD-1 targeted 
agents including nivolumab  or pembrolizumab, with grade 3 to 4 AEs occurring in 
1% to 2% of cases (Haanen et al 2017). The presence of diarrhea in conjunction with 
abdominal  pain,  rectal  bleeding,  mucus  in  the  stool,  and  fever  should  alert  the 
clinician  to  the  possibility  of  colitis,  a  potentially  serious  or  even  life-threatening 
gastrointestinal complication of ICI therapy (Puzanov et al 2017). 
Immune-mediated myositis/rhabdomyolysis: 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  inflammation  in  muscle  was  observed  in 
cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once 
every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data:  Immune-mediated  myositis/rhabdomyolysis  occur  uncommonly  in 
cancer patients 
ICIs  (AbdelRahman  et  al  2017).  Recognizing 
musculoskeletal imAEs in the oncology setting is challenging due to the broad range

in the general population. 
(hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism, 
Immune-mediated  endocrinopathies 
thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, pituitary dysfunction, diabetes mellitus) 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  thyroid  inflammation  was  observed  in 
cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once 
every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data:  Thyroid  disease  or  abnormalities  in  thyroid  function  tests  (primary 
hypothyroidism and thyroiditis) is one of the most common endocrine imAEs. Thyroid 
dysfunction (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis) was reported in 6 to 
20%  of patients  in  large  Phase III  clinical  trials  (Puzanov  et  al  2017).  Pituitary 
dysfunction is a rare condition which occurs in 0.5-1% of patients treated with anti-
PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy and up to 10% with combination CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade. 
In contrast to thyroid disorders, most patients with pituitary dysfunction present with 
clinical  symptoms  commonly  related  to  neuro-compression  or  more  often,  to 
secondary  adrenal  insufficiency  including  fatigue  and  nausea.  Primary  adrenal 
insufficiency  is  a  rare  complication  of  ICI  therapy.  Diabetes  Mellitus  following 
treatment with ICIs occurs in slightly less than 1% of patients; approximately 97% of 
all  reported  cases  have  arisen  with  anti-PD-1/PD-L1  monotherapy  or  combination 
treated patients (Wright et al 2021). 
Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  inflammation  in  kidneys  was  observed  in 
cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once 
every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. Secondary renal changes were observed at 
60 mg/kg due to immunogenicity against tislelizumab (anti-drug antibodies). 
Clinical data: In the published literature, renal immune-mediated AEs are considered 
rare.  Most  reports  document  isolated  cases  of  interstitial  nephritis  with  specific 
agents  and  regimens,  such  as  anti-PD-1  monotherapy,  and  combination 
anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 treatment in melanoma (Puzanov et al 2017). 
Immune-mediated myocarditis 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  inflammation  of  the  heart  was  observed  in 
cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once 
every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical data: Myocarditis and cardiac dysfunction due to ICIs are rare and the true 
incidence  is  unknown;  current  estimates  suggest  this  incidence  is  less  than 
1% of patients.  Cardiac  immune-mediated  AEs  due  to  ICIs  may  present  with 
nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and weakness. However, more typical cardiac 
symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, pulmonary or lower extremity edema, 
palpitations, irregular heartbeat, rapid onset of heart failure symptoms or new heart 
block on electrocardiogram (ECG) can occur at any time, more frequently within the 
first few months of treatment and may lead to death (Puzanov et al 2017). 
Immune-mediated nervous system disorders 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment  related  inflammation  in  brain  was  observed  in 
cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once 
every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data:  Neurologic  immune-related  adverse  events  are  uncommon  with  an 
overall  incidence  up  to  6%  with  anti-PD-1  antibodies  and  include  auto-immune 
encephalitis, myasthenic syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome (Puzanov et al 2017).

Clinical data: Immune-related adverse events can affect any organ system (Puzanov 
et  al  2017),  including  hematological,  ocular  or  rheumatological  manifestations 
(Haanen et al 2017). 
immune-mediated  reactions  were  observed 
Reference is made to the table above (Table 8-5). 
Patients with a history of or ongoing autoimmune disease may be at a higher risk of 
developing imAEs and are generally excluded from the clinical development program 
for tislelizumab. There are currently no identified risk groups or risk factors that may 
predispose  patients  to  developing  immune-mediated  adverse  reactions  after 
treatment with tislelizumab. 
Immune-mediated pneumonitis 
While on therapy with tislelizumab, patients should inform their HCP about any of the 
following symptoms that may indicate inflammation of the lung: shortness of breath, 
chest pain or cough. 
Patients with suspected pneumonitis should be evaluated with radiographic imaging 
and infectious or disease related aetiologies should be ruled out. 
The  HCP  should  monitor  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  pneumonitis.  Early  detection 
and treatment may prevent and/or mitigate the risk. The SmPC includes details on 
how to manage immune-mediated pneumonitis. 
Immune-mediated hepatitis 
The  SmPC  provides  recommendations  for  the  treatment  of  immune-mediated 
hepatitis,  including  withholding  tislelizumab,  administering  corticosteroids,  and 
permanently  discontinuing  tislelizumab  for  severe  or  life-threatening  symptoms. 
Tislelizumab  may  be  reintroduced  only  after  signs  and  symptoms  of  immune-
mediated hepatitis resolve and upon careful consideration by the treating physician. 
While  on  therapy  with  tislelizumab,  patients  should  inform  their  HCP  if  they 
experience any of the following symptoms that may indicate inflammation of the liver: 
nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, pain on the right side of the stomach, yellowing of 
the skin or whites of the eyes, drowsiness, dark coloured urine, bleeding or bruising 
more  easily  than  normal.  The  HCPs  should  monitor patients’  liver  function  tests 
(ALT/AST, direct and indirect bilirubin). If a patient develops hepatitis, the HCP may 
decide  to  stop  tislelizumab  temporarily  or  permanently.  Treatment  may  be 
necessary, including steroids. 
Immune-mediated skin adverse reaction 
The  SmPC  contains  recommendations  for  treatment  in  the  event  of  immune-
mediated  skin  reaction  including  administration  and  dosing  of  corticosteroids,  and 
permanent discontinuation of tislelizumab in patients with grade 4 rash. For signs or 
symptoms  of  suspected  severe  cutaneous  adverse  reactions  (SCARs),  including 
severe  erythema  multiforme  (EM),  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome  (SJS)  or  toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), HCPs should withhold tislelizumab and refer the patient

for  specialized  assessment  and  treatment.  If  SCARs,  including  SJS  or  TEN  is 
confirmed, tislelizumab should be permanently discontinued. 
The  HCPs  should  monitor  patients  for  suspected  severe  skin  reactions  (including 
EM, SJS or TEN). If patients develop signs or symptoms of a possible severe skin 
reaction, which may include fever, flu‑like symptoms, rash, itching, skin blistering or 
ulcers in the mouth or on other moist surfaces, they should notify their HCP. 
Immune-mediated colitis 
While on therapy with tislelizumab, patients should inform their HCP of any of the 
following symptoms that may indicate colitis: diarrhoea or more bowel movements 
than  normal,  black  tarry,  sticky  stools  or  stools  with  blood  or  mucus,  or  severe 
abdominal pain or tenderness. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of colitis. Infectious and disease related aetiologies should be ruled out. The HCPs 
should consider stopping treatment with tislelizumab temporarily or permanently and 
begin steroid therapy if indicated. 
The HCPs should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Early detection 
and treatment may prevent and/or mitigate the risk. The SmPC includes details on 
how to manage immune-mediated colitis. 
Immune-mediated myositis/rhabdomyolysis 
Patients  should  inform  their  HCP  if  they  are  experiencing  muscle  pain,  stiffness, 
weakness,  chest  pain  or  severe  tiredness  that  may  be  related  to  myositis.  If  a 
diagnosis  of  myositis  is  confirmed,  the  HCP  may  decide  to  stop  tislelizumab 
temporarily  or  permanently,  and  treatment  with  steroids  may  be  needed.  If  a 
diagnosis  of  rhabdomyolysis  is  confirmed,  the  HCP  may  also  decide  to  stop 
tislelizumab temporarily or permanently. Early detection and treatment may prevent 
and/or mitigate the risk. Treatment modification for immune-mediated myositis and 
rhabdomyolysis is included in the SmPC. 
Immune-mediated  endocrinopathies 
(hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism, 
thyroiditis,  adrenal  insufficiency,  pituitary  dysfunction,  type  1  diabetes 
mellitus) 
The SmPC provide recommendations for treatment in the event of immune-mediated 
endocrinopathies. 
The HCPs should monitor for signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies and monitor 
thyroid function before and periodically during treatment with tislelizumab. While on 
therapy  with  tislelizumab,  patients  should  inform  the  HCP  of  any  of  the  following 
symptoms: fast heart rate, extreme tiredness, weight gain or weight loss, dizziness 
or fainting, hair loss, feeling cold, constipation, headaches that will not go away or 
unusual headaches. 
Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction 
While on therapy with tislelizumab, patients should notify their HCP if they notice a 
change in the amount or color of their urine, pain while urinating or pain in kidney 
area. The HCP should monitor patients' renal function (serum creatinine). 
The SmPC provide recommendations for treatment in the event of immune-mediated 
nephritis  and  renal  dysfunction,  including  withholding  treatment,  administering 
corticosteroids, and permanently discontinuing tislelizumab in patients with recurrent 
severe or life-threatening symptoms. 
Immune-mediated myocarditis 
While on therapy with tislelizumab, patients should inform their HCP about any of the 
following symptoms that may be related to myocarditis including chest pain, rapid or 
abnormal heartbeat, shortness of breath at rest or during activity, fluid build-up with 
swelling of the legs, ankles and feet and tiredness. If a diagnosis of myocarditis is

Healthcare  professionals  should  consider  administering  specific  treatment  with 
steroids for myocarditis as soon as possible. Treatment modification for myocarditis 
is included in the SmPC. 
Immune-mediated nervous system disorders 
On therapy with tislelizumab, patients should inform the HCP of any of the following 
symptoms which may cause difficulty breathing, sensation of prickling or pins and 
needles in the fingers, toes, ankles or wrists, weakness in the legs that spreads to 
the upper body, unsteady walking or inability to walk or climb stairs, difficulty with 
facial  movements  including  speaking,  chewing  or  swallowing,  double  vision  or 
inability to move eyes, difficulty with bladder control or bowel function, rapid heart 
rate and paralysis. 
Early  detection  and  treatment  may  prevent  and/or  mitigate  the  risk.  If  a  patient 
develops immune-mediated encephalitis, the HCP may decide to stop tislelizumab 
treatment temporarily or permanently and treatment with steroids may be needed. 
The  product  label  includes  details  on  how  to  manage  immune-mediated  nervous 
system disorders. 
Immune-mediated pancreatitis 
The HCP should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis such as 
abdominal  pain,  nausea  and  vomiting,  and  onset  of  abdominal  pain  that  may 
gradually  or  abruptly  become  severe.  Blood  amylase  and  lipase  (at  the  start  of 
treatment,  at  regular  intervals  during  treatment,  and  as  clinical  assessment 
indicated)  should  also  be  monitored.  Early  detection  and  treatment  may  prevent 
and/or mitigate the risk. 
Other immune-mediated reactions 
Recommendations for the treatment of other immune disorders are provided in the 
SmPC. 
The  risk  should  be  managed  by  the  guidance  listed  in  the  tislelizumab  SmPC.  A 
Patient Card will be given to patients to inform them about these risks, to improve 
communication  with  physicians  and  timely  management  of  imAEs.  Overall,  the 
benefit-risk balance is positive given the clinical efficacy associated with the use of 
the product and the severity of the diseases.

Potential mechanisms 
The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is involved in the maintenance of tolerance to the fetus, 
PD-1 blockade can disrupt immune tolerance. 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Nonclinical data: No treatment-related effects were observed in reproductive organs 
in  cynomolgus  monkeys  following  i.v.  infusion  at  doses  of  3,  10,  30,  or  60 mg/kg 
(once  every  2 weeks,  7 doses)  for  13 weeks.  However,  not  all  animals  in  these 
studies  were  sexually  mature.  A  literature-based  assessment  of  effects  on 
embryofetal toxicity demonstrated that the pharmacologically mediated blockade of 
PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in animal models can result in fetal loss (Guleria et al 2005).

Reproductive and 
developmental toxicity 
Details 
This is due to disruption of immune tolerance to the fetus as the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
plays a role in the maintenance of tolerance (Tripathi and Guleria 2015). 
Clinical data: A clinical study conducted by Meggyes et al 2019 further supports the 
animal  model  data  and  highlighted  the  potential  importance  of  the  PD-1/PD-L1 
immune-checkpoint  pathway  in  the  induction  of  maternal  tolerance  during  healthy 
pregnancy.  The  PD-1  binding  to  the  abundantly  expressed  PD-L1  in  tumors  is 
analogous to the PD-1 binding to a highly-expressed PD-L1 at the utero-placental 
interface (Guleria et al 2005, Habicht et al 2007, Petroff and Perchellet 2010). The 
blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in inducing fetal loss/abortion has been shown 
in  murine  models  of  allogeneic  pregnancy.  Therefore,  the  potential  risks  of 
administering  a  PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitor,  including  tislelizumab  during  pregnancy 
include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. 
Based  on  the  mechanism  of  action,  the  administration  of  tislelizumab  during 
pregnancy could cause harm to the fetus. 
Characterization of the 
risk 
No  TEAEs  of  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  have  been  reported  in 
monotherapy  studies  (Study 302,  Study 001,  Study 102,  Study 203,  Study 204, 
Study 208 and Study 303).

Public health impact 
No relevant risk groups or risk factors have been identified. 
Tislelizumab should not be used during pregnancy and in  women of child-bearing 
potential not using effective contraception unless the clinical benefit outweighs the 
potential risk. Women should be advised not to breast feed during treatment and for 
at least 4 months after the last dose of tislelizumab. 
Women of child-bearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception 
during treatment with tislelizumab and for 4 months after the last dose. The SmPC 
includes details on reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
The risk should be well managed by the guidance provided in the tislelizumab SmPC. 
There  are  no  available  human  data  regarding  the  risk  of  reproductive  and 
developmental toxicity (SmPC). 
The  public  health  impact  of  this  event  attributable  to  tislelizumab  treatment  is 
expected to be low.

Part V.2. Additional Risk minimization measures 
Additional risk minimization measures 
To increase understanding of the safe and effective use of Tevimbra (tislelizumab), physicians 
should provide patients or their caregiver with the Patient Card. 
Objectives: 
The  Patient  Card  is  aimed  to  inform  patients  and  increase  their  awareness  on  the  signs  and 
symptoms relevant to the early recognition/identification of the potential imARs and prompt 
them about when to seek medical attention from their physician, ensuring rapid identification 
and treatment of these events. 
The Patient Card is designed for being always carried by the patient and to be presented to the 
HCP that may assist them. 
Rationale for the additional risk minimization activity: 
Immune-mediated reactions may be serious and life-threatening and can be mitigated with early 
detection and treatment. 
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
Prescribers will receive Patient Cards to hand over to patients who are prescribed tislelizumab 
or to their caregivers. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
Effectiveness  will  be  considered  through  routine  pharmacovigilance  safety  surveillance. 
Observations, findings, and outcomes of immune-mediated adverse reactions will be presented 
regularly in the PSURs including information collected via targeted follow-up checklist, when 
applicable.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan for Tevimbra 
(Tislelizumab) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Tevimbra. The RMP details important risks of Tevimbra, 
how  these  risks  can  be  minimized,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
Tevimbra’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Tevimbra’s SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to HCPs and patients on 
how Tevimbra should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Tevimbra should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Tevimbra’s RMP. 
13.1 
Part VI: I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Tevimbra, as monotherapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic ESCC after prior platinum-based chemotherapy. 
It contains tislelizumab as the active substance and it is given by the i.v. route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Tevimbra’s benefits can be found in Tevimbra’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage:  https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tevimbra. 
13.2 
Part  VI:  II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to 
minimize or further characterize the risks 
Important risks of Tevimbra, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Tevimbra’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
•
• The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

13.2.1  Part VI: II.A: List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Tevimbra are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there  is  sufficient  proof of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Tevimbra.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk – Immune-mediated adverse reactions 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Review of tislelizumab clinical trial data, post-marketing experience and 
literature  regarding  immune-mediated  adverse  reactions  (including 
immune-mediated  pneumonitis,  immune-mediated  hepatitis,  immune-
mediated  skin  adverse  reaction,  immune-mediated  colitis,  immune-
immune-mediated 
mediated 
endocrinopathies,  immune-mediated  nephritis  and  renal  dysfunction, 
immune-mediated  myocarditis,  immune-mediated  nervous  system 
disorder,  immune-mediated  pancreatitis,  and  other  immune-mediated 
reactions)  represent  sufficient  evidence  of  a  causal  association  with 
tislelizumab exposure. 
myositis/rhabdomyolysis, 
Immune-mediated pneumonitis 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  inflammation  in  lungs  was 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 
10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data:  The  most  common  lung  toxicity  observed  in patients 
receiving  ICI  treatment  is  pneumonitis.  Reports  of  pneumonitis  were 
documented in 2% to 4% of patients, with 1% to 2% of patients having 
grade ≥3 events, frequency of fatal pneumonitis in 0.2% of patients and 
discontinuation due to pneumonitis in 0.2% to 4% of patients. Patients 
with  NSCLC  were  significantly  more  likely  to  experience  any  grade 
pneumonitis  and  grade 3  or  higher  pneumonitis  compared  with  other 
tumor types. 
Immune-mediated hepatitis 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  hepatic  inflammation  was 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 
10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks.

Page 71 of 88 
VDT482A/Tislelizumab 
Clinical  data:  Although  infrequently  observed,  the  occurrence  of 
immune-mediated hepatitis is well established in patients treated with 
ICIs. These patients are typically asymptomatic, and diagnosis is made 
due  to  elevated  liver  enzymes  such  as  ALT  and/or  AST,  and 
occasionally  hyperbilirubinemia.  The  median  onset  of  transaminase 
elevation  is  approximately  6  to  14 weeks  after  starting  ICI treatment, 
and the incidence of developing immune-mediated hepatitis in patients 
treated with ICIs is approximately 5%. 
Immune-mediated skin adverse reaction 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  skin  rash  was  observed  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys  following  i.v.  infusion  at  doses  of  3,  10,  30,  or 
60 mg/kg (once every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data:  Skin  AEs  are  among  the  most  frequent  AEs  observed 
in patients  treated  with  mAbs  inhibiting  either  immune  checkpoints 
CTLA4  (ipilimumab  in  43%  to  45%  of  the patients)  or  PD-(L)1 
(nivolumab and pembrolizumab in approximately 34% of the patients). 
However,  serious  skin  AEs  are  rare  and  do  not  usually  require  dose 
reductions or treatment discontinuation. 
Immune-mediated colitis 
Nonclinical data: No treatment-related diarrhea or gastrointestinal tract 
inflammation  was  observed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  following  i.v. 
infusion  at  doses  of  3,  10,  30,  or  60 mg/kg  (once  every  2 weeks, 
7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical data: Diarrhoea and colitis are more frequent with anti-cytotoxic 
T  lymphocyte-associated  protein 4  (CTLA4)  agents  (e.g.,  ipilimumab) 
including  nivolumab  or 
targeted  agents 
than  with  anti-PD-(L)1 
pembrolizumab, with grade 3 to 4 AEs occurring in 1% to 2% of cases 
(Haanen et al 2017).  The  presence  of  diarrhea  in  conjunction  with 
abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, mucus in the stool, and fever should 
alert the clinician to the possibility of colitis, a potentially serious or even 
life-threatening gastrointestinal complication of ICI therapy. 
Immune-mediated myositis/rhabdomyolysis: 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  inflammation  in  muscle  was 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 
10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data: 
Immune-mediated  myositis/rhabdomyolysis  occur 
ICIs.  Recognizing 
uncommonly 
musculoskeletal imAEs in the oncology setting is challenging due to the 
broad  range  of  potential  presenting  symptoms  and  the  prevalence  of 
musculoskeletal complaints in the general population.

Clinical data: Thyroid disease or abnormalities in thyroid function tests 
(primary  hypothyroidism  and  thyroiditis)  is  one  of  the  most  common

imAEs. 
Thyroid 
dysfunction 
endocrine 
(hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis) was reported in 6 to 20% of patients in 
large  Phase III  clinical  trials.  Pituitary  dysfunction  is  a  rare  condition 
which  occurs  in  0.5-1%  of  patients  treated  with  anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
monotherapy and up to 10% with combination CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade. 
In contrast to thyroid disorders, most patients with pituitary dysfunction 
present with clinical symptoms commonly related to neuro-compression 
or more often, to secondary adrenal insufficiency including fatigue and 
nausea.  Primary  adrenal  insufficiency  is  a  rare  complication  of  ICI 
therapy. Diabetes Mellitus following treatment with ICIs occurs in slightly 
less than 1% of patients; approximately 97% of all reported cases have 
arisen  with  anti-PD-1/PD-L1  monotherapy  or  combination  treated 
patients. 
Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  inflammation  in  kidneys  was 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 
10,  30,  or  60 mg/kg  (once  every  2 weeks,  7 doses)  for  13 weeks. 
Secondary  renal  changes  were  observed  at  60  mg/kg  due  to 
immunogenicity against tislelizumab (anti-drug-antibodies). 
Clinical  data:  In  the  published  literature,  renal  immune-mediated  AEs 
are considered rare. Most reports document isolated cases of interstitial 
nephritis  with  specific  agents  and  regimens,  such  as  anti-PD(L)1 
in 
monotherapy,  and  combination  antiCTLA4/PD(L)1 
melanoma. 
treatment 
Immune-mediated myocarditis 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  inflammation  of  the  heart  was 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 
10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical data: Myocarditis and cardiac dysfunction due to ICIs are rare 
and  the  true  incidence  is  unknown;  current  estimates  suggest  this 
incidence  is  less  than  1% of patients.  Cardiac  immune-mediated  AEs 
due to ICIs may present with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and 
weakness.  However,  more  typical  cardiac  symptoms  of  chest  pain, 
shortness of breath, pulmonary or lower extremity edema, palpitations, 
irregular heartbeat, rapid onset of heart failure symptoms or new heart 
block on ECG can occur at any time, more frequently within the first few 
months of treatment and may lead to death. 
Immune-mediated nervous system disorders 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment  related  inflammation  in  brain  was 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 
10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data:  Neurologic 
immune-related  adverse  events  are 
uncommon  with  an  overall  incidence  up  to  6%  with  anti-PD-(L)1 
antibodies  and 
include  auto-immune  encephalitis,  myasthenic 
syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Immune-mediated pancreatitis 
Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment  related  inflammation  in  pancreas  was 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 
10, 30, or 60 mg/kg (once every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical data: Acute pancreatitis has been reported but is rare in cancer 
patients  treated  with  ICIs;  asymptomatic  elevation  of  lipase  and 
amylase are more common. 
Other immune-mediated reactions 
Nonclinical data: No other immune-mediated reactions were observed 
in cynomolgus monkeys following i.v. infusion at doses of 3, 10, 30, or 
60 mg/kg (once every 2 weeks, 7 doses) for 13 weeks. 
Clinical  data:  Immune-related  adverse  events  can  affect  any  organ 
system,

manifestations. 
including  hematological,  ocular  or 
Patients with a history of or ongoing autoimmune disease may be at a 
higher  risk  of  developing  imAEs  and  are  generally  excluded  from  the 
clinical  development  program  for  tislelizumab.  There  are  currently  no 
identified  risk  groups  or  risk  factors  that  may  predispose  patients  to 
developing  immune-mediated  adverse  reactions  after  treatment  with 
tislelizumab. 
Routine risk minimization measures:

Nonclinical  data:  No  treatment-related  effects  were  observed  in 
reproductive  organs  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  following  i.v.  infusion  at 
doses  of  3,  10,  30,  or  60  mg/kg  (once  every  2 weeks,  7 doses)  for 
13 weeks.  However,  not  all  animals  in  these  studies  were  sexually 
mature. A literature-based assessment of effects on embryofetal toxicity 
demonstrated 
the  pharmacologically  mediated  blockade  of 
PD1/PDL1 interaction in animal models can result in fetal loss. This is 
due to disruption of immune tolerance to the fetus as the PD-1/PD-L1 
pathway plays a role in the maintenance of tolerance. 
A clinical study further supported the animal model data and highlighted 
the potential importance of the PD1/PDL1 immune-checkpoint pathway 
in  the  induction  of  maternal  tolerance  during  healthy  pregnancy.  The 
PD1 binding to the abundantly expressed PDL1 in tumors is analogous 
to  the  PD1  binding  to  a  highly-expressed  PDL1  at  the  uteroplacental 
interface.  The  blockade  of  the  PD1/PDL1  pathway  in  inducing  fetal 
loss/abortion  has  been  shown  in  murine  models  of  allogeneic

Annex  6  -  Details  of  proposed  additional  risk  minimization  activities  (if 
applicable) 
Key safety messages of additional risk minimization measures: 
Prior  to  the  launch  of  Tevimbra  (tislelizumab)  in  each  Member  State,  the  MAH  must  agree 
about the content and format of the Patient Card, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the program, with the National Competent Authority. 
The Patient Card is aimed at increasing the awareness of patients on the signs and symptoms 
relevant  to  the  early  recognition/identification  of  the  potential  immune-mediated  adverse 
reactions  (imARs)  and  prompt  them  about  when  to  seek  medical  attention.  It  also  contains 
prompts to enter contact details of the physician and to alert other physicians that the patient is 
being  treated  with  Tevimbra.  The  Patient  Card  is  designed  for  being  always  carried  by  the 
patient and to be presented to the healthcare professionals that may help them. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Tevimbra (tislelizumab) is marketed, 
all patients who are expected to use Tevimbra (tislelizumab) have access to/are provided with 
the Patient Card disseminated through healthcare professionals. 
The Patient Card will contain the following key messages: 
• Description of the main signs or symptoms of the immune-mediated adverse reactions
(e.g.: pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, immune-mediated skin adverse
reactions, nephritis and other imARs) and infusion-related reactions, and the importance
of notifying their treating physician immediately if symptoms occur.
• The importance of not attempting to self-treat any symptoms without consulting their
healthcare professional first.
• The importance of carrying the Patient Card at all times and to show it at all medical visits
to healthcare professionals other than the prescriber (e.g. emergency healthcare
professionals).
• A warning message for healthcare professionals treating the patient at any time, including
in conditions of emergency, that the patient is treated with Tevimbra.
• A reminder that all known or suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can also be
reported to local regulatory authorities.
• The contact details of their Tevimbra prescriber.

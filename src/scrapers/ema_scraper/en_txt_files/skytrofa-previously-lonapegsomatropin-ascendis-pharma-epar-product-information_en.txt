PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Powder and solvent for solution for injection (injection). 
White to off-white powder. 
The solvent is a clear and colourless solution.  
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Growth failure in children and adolescents aged from 3 years up to 18 years due to insufficient 
endogenous growth hormone secretion (growth hormone deficiency [GHD]). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are qualified and experienced in the 
diagnosis and management of paediatric patients with GHD. 
The amount and concentration of lonapegsomatropin is always expressed in terms of mg somatropin 
referring to the content of the somatropin moiety and not including mPEG-linker in order to prevent 
medication errors when patients switch from daily somatropin therapy.

Posology 
The posology and administration should be individualised for each patient. 
Starting dose 
The recommended starting dose of Skytrofa is 0.24 mg somatropin/kg body weight, given once 
weekly. The recommended starting dose strengths for such a dose by weight range can be found in 
Table 1.

If prescribing a dose other than 0.24 mg somatropin/kg/week, calculate the total weekly dose (in mg 
somatropin) and select the appropriate dose strength as follows: 
• 
Total weekly dose (mg somatropin) = prescribed dose (mg somatropin/kg) x patient’s body 
weight (kg) 
Round the total weekly dose (mg somatropin) to the closest dose strength while also considering 
treatment goals and clinical response. 
• 
Starting dose for patients switching from daily somatropin medicinal products 
If changing therapy to once-weekly lonapegsomatropin from daily somatropin, there should be at 
least 8 hours between the final dose of once-daily somatropin and the first dose of lonapegsomatropin. 
In children switching from daily somatropin, physicians may adjust the starting dose taking into 
consideration the current somatropin dose, individual clinical response, and clinical considerations 
specific to the patient. 
For children switching from daily somatropin medicinal products at a weekly dose equal to or greater 
than 0.24 mg somatropin/kg body weight, the recommended starting dose of lonapegsomatropin 
is 0.24 mg somatropin/kg body weight (see Table 1). 
For children switching from daily somatropin medicinal products at a weekly dose less than 0.24 mg 
somatropin/kg body weight, use the previously prescribed weekly dose as the recommended starting 
dose of lonapegsomatropin (see equation above). 
Dose titration 
The dose of lonapegsomatropin should be individually adjusted for each patient based on clinical 
response, adverse reactions, and/or serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations outside 
the targeted range. Available somatropin dose strengths can be found in section 1.  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Average IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS) levels (drawn 4-5 days after dosing) can be used as 
guidance for dose titration (see Table 2). It is necessary to wait a minimum of 2 weeks after initiation 
of lonapegsomatropin or after any dose change before assessing the resulting IGF-1 SDS levels. Dose 
adjustments should be targeted to achieve average IGF-1 SDS levels in the normal range, i.e. 
between -2 and +2 (preferably close to 0 SDS). 
IGF-1 SDS levels may vary over time, and therefore routine monitoring of serum IGF-1 SDS levels 
throughout the course of treatment is recommended, especially during puberty.

Treatment evaluation 
Evaluation of efficacy and safety should be considered at approximately 6- to 12-month intervals and 
may be assessed by evaluating auxological parameters, biochemistry (IGF-1, hormones, glucose, and 
lipid levels), and pubertal status. More frequent evaluations should be considered during puberty. 
Treatment should be discontinued in patients with annualised height velocity < 2 cm/year, final height 
achievement, height velocity SDS < + 1 after the first year of treatment, or in case bone age is 
> 14 years (girls) or > 16 years (boys) which corresponds to the closure of the epiphyseal growth 
plates. 
Once the epiphyses are fused, patients should be clinically re-evaluated for the need for growth 
hormone treatment. 
Oral oestrogen therapy 
Females on oral oestrogen-containing therapy may require a higher dose of growth hormone to 
achieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4). 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible and no more than 2 days after the 
missed dose. If more than 2 days have passed, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose 
should be administered on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their 
regular once weekly dosing schedule. 
Changing the dosing day 
The day of weekly injection can be changed to a different day of the week. Lonapegsomatropin can be 
administered 2 days before or 2 days after the scheduled dosing day. It should be ensured that at 
least 5 days will pass between the last dose and the newly-established regular once weekly dosing day. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No information in patients with renal impairment is available and dose recommendations cannot be 
given. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No information in patients with hepatic impairment is available and dose recommendations cannot be 
given. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lonapegsomatropin in children under 3 years of age has not been 
established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Each injection should be administered subcutaneously once-weekly in the abdomen, buttock or thigh. 
The site of administration should be varied to prevent lipoatrophy. 
Lonapegsomatropin is intended to be administered after reconstitution of the powder for solution for 
injection with the enclosed solvent. Lonapegsomatropin should be administered by means of the 
Skytrofa Auto-Injector. The patient and caregiver should receive training to ensure understanding of 
the administration procedure by means of the device in order to be allowed to (self)-inject 
lonapegsomatropin. 
The reconstituted solution should be colourless and clear to opalescent and free or practically free of 
visible particles (see section 6.6).  
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and 
the instructions included at the end of the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 
4.4). 
Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour (see section 4.4). 
Intracranial tumours must be inactive and anti-tumour therapy must be completed prior to starting 
growth hormone therapy. Treatment should be discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth. 
Patients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal 
surgery, multiple accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not be treated 
with lonapegsomatropin (regarding patients undergoing substitution therapy, see section 4.4). 
Lonapegsomatropin must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Acute critical illness 
In critically ill adult patients suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, 
multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure mortality was higher in patients treated 
with 5.3 mg or 8 mg somatropin daily (i.e. 37.1 – 56 mg/week) compared to patients receiving 
placebo, 42% vs. 19%. As there is no information available on the safety of growth hormone 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
substitution therapy in acutely critically ill patients, the benefits of continued lonapegsomatropin 
treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential risks involved. In all patients 
developing other or similar acute critical illness, the possible benefit of treatment with 
lonapegsomatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved. 
Neoplasm 
In patients with previous malignant disease, special attention should be given to signs and symptoms 
of relapse. 
Patients with pre-existing tumours or GHD secondary to an intracranial lesion should be examined 
routinely for progression or recurrence of the underlying disease process. 
In childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported in patients 
treated with growth hormone after their first neoplasm. Intracranial tumours, in particular 
meningiomas, were the most common form of a second neoplasm reported in patients treated with 
radiation to the head for their first neoplasm. 
Hypersensitivity 
Anaphylactic reactions including angioedema have been reported with the use of lonapegsomatropin.  
Inform patients and caregivers that such reactions can occur, particularly after first dose, and that 
prompt medical attention should be sought if a sudden serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs.  
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the use of lonapegsomatropin should be discontinued (see section 
4.3). 
Benign intracranial hypertension 
In case of severe or recurrent ataxia, headache, visual problems, nausea and/or vomiting, a funduscopy 
for papilloedema is recommended. If papilloedema is confirmed, a diagnosis of benign intracranial 
hypertension should be considered and, if appropriate, growth hormone treatment should be 
discontinued. At present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of 
growth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension. If growth hormone 
treatment is restarted, careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary. 
Funduscopic examination is recommended at the initiation and periodically during the course of 
treatment. 
Insulin sensitivity 
Growth hormone may reduce insulin sensitivity. For patients with diabetes mellitus, the insulin dose 
may require adjustment after lonapegsomatropin therapy is instituted. Patients with diabetes mellitus, 
glucose intolerance, or additional risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored closely during 
lonapegsomatropin therapy (see section 4.5). 
Hypoadrenalism 
Introduction of growth hormone treatment may result in inhibition of 11β-Hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Consequently, 
previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid 
replacement may be required. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement therapy for 
previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses, 
following initiation of lonapegsomatropin treatment (see section 4.5). 
Thyroid function 
Growth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 which may result in a reduction 
in serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations. Monitoring of thyroid function should 
therefore be conducted in all patients. In patients with hypopituitarism on standard replacement 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therapy, the potential effect of lonapegsomatropin treatment on thyroid function must be closely 
monitored (see section 4.5 and 4.8). 
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis 
In patients with endocrine disorders, including GHD, slipped epiphyses of the hip may occur more 
frequently than in the general population. Children with persistent hip/knee pain and/or limping during 
treatment with lonapegsomatropin should be examined clinically. 
Scoliosis 
Scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth. Because growth hormone treatment increases 
growth rate, signs and progression of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment. However, 
growth hormone treatment has not been shown to increase the incidence or severity of scoliosis (see 
section 4.8). 
Pancreatitis 
Although rare, pancreatitis should be considered in growth hormone treated children who develop 
unexplained abdominal pain. 
Prader-Willi syndrome 
Lonapegsomatropin has not been studied in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Lonapegsomatropin 
is not indicated for the long-term treatment of paediatric patients who have growth failure due to 
genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome unless they also have a diagnosis of GHD. There have 
been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with growth hormone in patients with 
Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of 
upper airway obstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection. 
Leukaemia 
Leukaemia has been reported in a small number of GHD patients, some of whom have been treated 
with somatropin. However, there is no evidence that the leukaemia incidence is increased in growth 
hormone recipients without predisposing factors. 
Use with oral oestrogen containing therapy 
Oral oestrogen influences the IGF-1 response to growth hormone. If a female patient taking 
lonapegsomatropin begins oral oestrogen containing therapy, the dose of lonapegsomatropin may need 
to be increased to maintain the serum IGF-1 levels within the normal age appropriate range (see 
section 4.2). Conversely, if a female patient on lonapegsomatropin discontinues oral oestrogen 
containing therapy, the dose of lonapegsomatropin may need to be reduced to avoid excess of growth 
hormone and/or adverse reactions (see section 4.5). 
Antibodies 
Antibodies to lonapegsomatropin were observed in some patients. None of these antibodies were 
neutralising and there was no apparent clinical impact. However, testing for the presence of antibodies 
should be considered in patients who fail to respond to therapy.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Glucocorticoid treatment 
Concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids inhibits the growth-promoting effects of 
lonapegsomatropin. Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency should have their 
glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully adjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth, and 
patients treated with glucocorticoids should have their growth monitored carefully to assess the 
potential impact of glucocorticoid treatment on growth. 
Growth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously 
undiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective (see 
section 4.4). 
Cytochrome P450-metabolised products 
Drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed with lonapegsomatropin. Data from interaction 
studies with somatropin performed in growth hormone deficient children and adults, and healthy 
elderly men, suggest that somatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known 
to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, especially CYP3A and CYP1A2. The clearance of 
compounds metabolised by CYP 3A4 (e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and 
ciclosporin) and CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline) may be increased and could result in lower exposure of 
these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. 
Insulin and/or other hypoglycaemic agents 
In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring therapy with a medicinal product (e.g, anti-hyperglycaemic 
medicinal products), the dose of insulin and/or oral hypoglycaemic medicinal product may require 
adjustment when lonapegsomatropin therapy is initiated (see section 4.4). 
Thyroid hormones 
Because growth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3, adjustment of thyroid 
hormone replacement therapy may be necessary (see section 4.4). 
Oral oestrogen therapy 
In female patients on oral oestrogen-containing therapy, a higher dose of growth hormone may be 
required to achieve the treatment goal (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of lonapegsomatropin in pregnant women; 
published studies with short-acting somatropin use in pregnant women over several decades have not 
identified any drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or foetal 
outcomes. 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Skytrofa is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breastfeeding 
There are no data on the presence of lonapegsomatropin in human milk or effect on the breastfed 
newborns/infants. As lonapegsomatropin is not orally absorbed, it is unlikely to adversely affect the 
breastfed newborns/infants. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skytrofa can be used during breastfeeding on strict indication. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effect of lonapegsomatropin on fertility. Animal studies are 
insufficient with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lonapegsomatropin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials with lonapegsomatropin were 
headache (11.1%), arthralgia (4.6%), secondary hypothyroidism (2.6%), and injection site reactions 
(1.6%). In general, these reactions tended to be transient and severity was mild to moderate.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 3 below shows adverse reactions which occurred during lonapegsomatropin treatment. The 
adverse reactions are ranked under headings of MedDRA system organ class and frequency using the 
following terminology: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 
<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), and frequency not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data).

generally mild and transient. 
b Anaphylactic reactions reported with lonapegsomatropin included angioedema (see section 4.4). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immunogenicity 
Patients may develop antibodies to lonapegsomatropin. The proportion of patients testing positive for 
detectable binding antibodies at any time during treatment was low (6.3%) and no patients had 
neutralising antibodies. No apparent correlation of anti-lonapegsomatropin binding antibodies to 
adverse events or loss of efficacy was observed. In case of an otherwise unexplained lack of response 
to lonapegsomatropin treatment, testing for antibodies to lonapegsomatropin should be considered (see 
section 4.4).

allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Acute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. Long-term 
overdose could result in signs and symptoms of gigantism. 
Management 
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote for somatropin overdose. 
It is recommended to monitor thyroid function following an overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and 
somatropin agonists, ATC Code: H01AC09. 
Mechanism of action 
Lonapegsomatropin is a long-acting ‘prodrug’ of somatropin. Lonapegsomatropin consists of the 
parent drug, somatropin, that is transiently conjugated to a methoxypolyethylene glycol carrier 
(4 x 10 kDa mPEG) via a proprietary TransCon Linker. The carrier has a shielding effect that 
minimizes renal excretion and receptor-mediated clearance of lonapegsomatropin. After subcutaneous 
administration, lonapegsomatropin releases fully active somatropin via autocleavage of the TransCon 
Linker. Somatropin (191 amino acids) has the same mode of action and distribution as daily 
somatropin, but with a once-weekly subcutaneous injection. 
Somatropin binds to a dimeric hGH receptor in the cell membrane of target cells resulting in 
intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Somatropin has direct tissue 
and metabolic effects, and indirect effects mediated by IGF-1, including stimulation of chondrocyte 
differentiation and proliferation, stimulation of hepatic glucose output, protein synthesis and lipolysis. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Somatropin stimulates skeletal growth in paediatric patients with GHD as a result of effects on the 
growth plates (epiphyses) of bones. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Somatropin released from lonapegsomatropin produces a dose linear IGF-1 response, with a change in 
dose of 0.02 mg somatropin/kg resulting in an approximate change in average weekly IGF-1 standard 
deviation score (SDS) of 0.17. 
At steady-state, IGF-1 SDS levels peaked approximately 2 days post-dose, with the average weekly 
IGF-1 SDS coinciding with approximately 4.5 days post-dose (Figure 1). IGF-1 SDS levels were in 
the normal range for GHD patients for the majority of the week, similar to daily somatropin. 
Figure 1  Mean (±SE) IGF-1 SDS at steady-state in children with GHD after administration of 
once-weekly lonapegsomatropin 0.24 mg somatropin/kg/week  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of once-weekly lonapegsomatropin were evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials 
that included 306 paediatric patients with GHD. 
In a 52-week multi-centre randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group phase 3 clinical 
trial, 161 treatment-naïve, prepubertal paediatric patients with GHD were randomised to once-weekly 
lonapegsomatropin (N=105) or daily somatropin (N=56), both at a total weekly dose of 0.24 mg 
somatropin/kg. The patients ranged in age from 3.2 to 13.1 years with a mean of 8.5 years. Most 
(N=132 (82%)) subjects were male. The patients had a mean baseline height SDS of -2.93. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was annualised height velocity (AHV) at week 52. Treatment with 
once-weekly lonapegsomatropin for 52 weeks resulted in a non-inferior AHV compared to once-daily 
somatropin (Table 4). Also, changes in the height standard deviation score (SDS) (change from 
baseline) tended to be larger for once-weekly lonapegsomatropin compared to once-daily somatropin 
(Table 4). Changes in AHV and height SDS tended to be larger for lonapegsomatropin compared to 
those of somatropin from week 26 through the end of the trial at week 52. 
The mean (SD) ratio of bone age to chronological age advanced similarly in both arms from baseline 
to week 52: 0.69 (0.16) to 0.75 (0.15) with once-weekly lonapegsomatropin and 0.70 (0.14) 
to 0.76 (0.14) with daily somatropin.

Supportive evidence 
Evidence from additional clinical trials on lonapegsomatropin support the long-term clinical efficacy 
of lonapegsomatropin treatment. 
In a 26-week single-arm open-label clinical trial evaluating lonapegsomatropin 0.24 mg 
somatropin/kg/week in 146 paediatric GHD patients aged 1 to 17 years old, of whom 143 had received 
prior daily somatropin treatment for mean (SD) 1.1 (0.7) years, the mean (SD) annualized height 
velocity was 9 (2.7) cm/year and the mean (SD) change from trial baseline in height SDS 
was 0.28 (0.25). Patient and caregiver preference were evaluated at week 13. 84% of patients and 90% 
of caregivers preferred once-weekly lonapegsomatropin over their prior daily somatropin.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The pharmacokinetics following administration of lonapegsomatropin was assessed after single dose 
in a total of 73 healthy adults in 2 trials. In addition, PK in paediatrics with GHD was evaluated based 
on intense sampling at week 13 in 11 subjects and sparse sampling in 109 subjects across 2 trials. 
Demographic details are provided in Table 6 for the subjects included in the pharmacokinetic 
evaluation of lonapegsomatropin.

Absorption 
Following subcutaneous dose administration, lonapegsomatropin releases somatropin in a controlled 
manner that follows first-order kinetics.  
In paediatric GHD patients, following subcutaneous dose administration of 
lonapegsomatropin 0.24 mg somatropin/kg/week, the observed mean (CV%) steady state peak serum 
concentration (Cmax) of lonapegsomatropin was 1230 (86.3) ng somatropin/mL at median Tmax 
of 25 hours, and for released somatropin Cmax was 15.2 (83.4) ng/mL with a median time to reach Cmax 
of 12 hours. The mean (CV%) somatropin exposure over the one-week dose interval (area under the 
curve) was 500 (83.8) h*ng/mL. Accumulation of lonapegsomatropin or somatropin following repeat 
dose administration was not observed. 
In paediatric GHD patients, injections were rotated between the abdomen, buttock, and thigh. No 
apparent association of administration site with somatropin exposure was observed.  
The absolute bioavailability of lonapegsomatropin following subcutaneous dose administration has not 
been investigated. 
Distribution 
In paediatric GHD patients, the mean (CV%) steady state apparent volume of distribution of 
lonapegsomatropin after subcutaneous administration of 0.24 mg somatropin/kg/week was 0.13 (109) 
L/kg. Somatropin released from lonapegsomatropin is expected to have a similar volume of 
distribution as endogenous growth hormone. 
Elimination 
Metabolism 
The metabolic fate of somatropin involves protein catabolism in both the liver and kidneys. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Excretion 
In paediatric GHD patients, the mean (CV%) steady state apparent clearance of lonapegsomatropin 
after subcutaneous administration of 0.24 mg somatropin/kg/week was 3.2 (67) mL/h/kg with a mean 
(±SD) observed half-life of 30.7 (± 12.7) hours. The apparent half-life of somatropin released from 
lonapegsomatropin was approximately 25 hours. 
Special populations 
No sex-specific pharmacokinetic studies have been done with lonapegsomatropin. The available 
literature indicates that the pharmacokinetics of somatropin is similar in males and females. 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body weight do not have 
a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics. 
No studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairments have been conducted with lonapegsomatropin 
(see section 4.2). A reduction in somatropin clearance following administration of daily somatropin 
has been noted in patients with severe liver and kidney dysfunction. The clinical significance of this 
decrease is unknown. The pharmacokinetics of the mPEG carrier of lonapegsomatropin is expected to 
be dependent on renal function but has not been assessed in patients with renal impairment. 
Lonapegsomatropin has not been studied in patients below 6 months of age (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on safety pharmacology, repeated dose 
toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. 
Reproductive toxicology studies performed in rats and histopathological evaluation of reproductive 
organs in monkeys administered subcutaneous lonapegsomatropin at doses up to 20-fold the clinical 
dose of 0.24 mg somatropin/kg/week did not induce adverse effects on male and female fertility or on 
reproductive organs. Due to antibody formation impairing exposure in rats, no firm conclusion can be 
made with respect to the relevance for human fertility. 
No embryonic or foetal development toxicities occurred in rats administered subcutaneous 
lonapegsomatropin at doses up to 13-fold the clinical dose of 0.24 mg somatropin/kg/week. Due to 
intermittent exposure no firm conclusion can be made with respect to the embryo-foetal development 
study in rats. 
An embryo-foetal development toxicity study in rabbits has shown foetal abnormalities and 
embryo-foetal mortality at 1.5-fold and 6-fold, the clinical dose of 0.24 mg somatropin/kg/week, 
respectively, and possibly caused by maternal toxicity. The clinical relevance of these findings is 
uncertain. 
In a pre- and postnatal developmental study in rats there were no adverse effects on the 
pregnant/lactating female or on development of the conceptus and the offspring following exposure of 
the female from implantation through weaning to subcutaneous doses of a structurally related 
transiently pegylated somatropin prodrug up to 13-fold the clinical dose of 0.24 mg 
somatropin/kg/week. 
mPEG exposure 
At about 10 times the human exposure to the mPEG component of lonapegsomatropin, vacuolation 
occurs in choroid plexus (CP) epithelial cells of cynomolgus monkeys after one year of exposure. At 
about 34 times the human exposure to mPEG, a slight increase in the number of animals with vacuoles 
was seen in CP epithelial cells of monkeys. The vacuolation was not associated with adverse 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
morphological changes or clinical signs. Vacuolation of cells is considered an adaptive response. 
Therefore, this is not considered as a possible adverse effect in humans at the therapeutic dose.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Skytrofa is and what it is used for 
Skytrofa is a medicine that contains the active substance lonapegsomatropin. This is a substance that 
the body can convert into somatropin, also called human growth hormone (hGH). Somatropin is 
needed for bones and muscles to grow and helps your body to develop the right amount of fat and 
muscle tissues.  
Skytrofa is used to treat children and adolescents, aged 3 up to 18 years, who have failed to grow 
because their body produces no growth hormone or not enough. Doctors call this growth hormone 
deficiency (GHD). After injection, Skytrofa is slowly converted into somatropin, supplying the 
missing growth hormone. 
2.  What you or your child need to know before you or your child use Skytrofa  
Do not use Skytrofa   
• 
If you are allergic to lonapegsomatropin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6) 
If you have a tumour (cancer) which is growing. You must have finished your anti-tumour 
treatment, and tumours must be inactive before you start your treatment with Skytrofa  
If you have recently had an open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma 
or acute respiratory failure 
• 
• 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
If you have been told by your doctor that the parts of your bones that grow and increase height 
(growth plates or epiphyses) have closed and stopped growing 
Tell your doctor before starting the treatment if any of these apply to you. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before using Skytrofa. It is especially important to talk about 
anything mentioned below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you previously had an intracranial tumour, a doctor will examine you regularly during your 
treatment for recurrence of the tumour or any other cancer. 
If you develop a strong headache, disturbed vision, vomiting or inability to coordinate 
voluntary muscle movements (ataxia), especially in the first few weeks of treatment, tell your 
doctor straight away. These may be signs of raised pressure in the skull (intracranial pressure). 
See section 4, possible side effects. 
If you have diabetes mellitus, high blood sugar (glucose intolerance), or additional risk factors 
for diabetes, your blood sugar may need to be checked regularly and the dose of your diabetes 
medicine may need to be adjusted. 
If you are being treated for adrenal insufficiency with corticosteroids, talk to your doctor, as 
your steroid dose may need regular adjustment. 
If you are being treated with thyroid hormones or you need to start thyroid hormone 
replacement, your doctor will test your thyroid function regularly and the dose may need to be 
adjusted. 
If you have persistent hip or knee pain when walking, or if you start to limp during your growth 
hormone treatment, tell your doctor. These could be symptoms of a condition that affects the 
thighbone (femur) where it inserts into the hip (slipped capital femoral epiphysis) and that 
occurs with greater frequency in children on growth hormone therapy. 
If you notice a sideways curve in your spine (scoliosis), you will need to be checked often by 
your doctor. 
If you get a stomach ache (pain in your tummy) that gets worse, tell your doctor. Your doctor 
may test for pancreatitis, which is when an organ called the pancreas becomes inflamed. See 
section 4, possible side effects. 
If you have signs and symptoms of a sudden serious allergic reaction (e.g. breathing 
difficulty, swelling of your face, mouth, or tongue, fast heartbeat, hives, rash, fever), you should 
promptly seek medical attention.  
If you have Prader-Willi syndrome, you should not be treated with Skytrofa unless you also 
have GHD. Skytrofa has not been studied in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome and 
therefore its effectiveness as a treatment for this condition is unknown. 
A small number of patients given growth hormone replacement have developed a type of 
cancer of the blood and bone marrow (leukaemia). However, it has not been proven that 
growth hormone treatment caused the cancer. 
If you have immediate complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, a bad 
accident (trauma), or an acute critical illness like acute respiratory failure. 
If you are a female taking oral contraception or hormonal replacement therapy with 
oestrogen, your dose of Skytrofa may need to be higher. If you or your child stop using oral 
oestrogen, your dose of Skytrofa may need to be reduced. 
Other medicines and Skytrofa  
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any of the following medicines:  
• 
• 
Insulin or any other medicines to treat diabetes mellitus 
Thyroid hormone treatments such as levothyroxine 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Tablets containing oestrogen, including tablets for oestrogen replacement therapy or for 
contraception  
Steroids or synthetic adrenal hormones (corticosteroids or glucocorticoids) 
Medicines to treat epilepsy or fits (seizures) - antiseizure medicines (anticonvulsants) such as 
carbamazepine 
Ciclosporin (immunosuppressive medicine) - a medicine to suppress your immune system 
Theophylline, a medicine used to treat asthma and other chronic lung diseases 
Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of these medicines or the dose of Skytrofa. 
Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor before taking this medicine. 
Pregnancy  
If you are able to get pregnant, you should not use Skytrofa unless you are also using reliable 
contraception. There are no data from the use of Skytrofa in pregnant women. Skytrofa is not to be 
used during pregnancy. This is because it is not known if it could harm your unborn child. If you are 
pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor. If you 
become pregnant during treatment, tell your doctor immediately. 
Breastfeeding 
It is not known whether Skytrofa can pass into breast milk. However, as lonapegsomatropin is not 
absorbed by mouth, it is unlikely to adversely affect the breastfed infant. If you are breast-feeding or 
intend to breast-feed, ask your doctor for advice before using Skytrofa. Skytrofa can be used during 
breastfeeding on strict indication. 
Driving and using machines 
Skytrofa does not affect the ability to drive or to use machines.  
3. 
How to use Skytrofa 
This medicine will only be prescribed by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone treatment 
and who has confirmed your diagnosis. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. Your doctor will show you how to use Skytrofa. 
Skytrofa is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). This means that it is injected 
with a short needle into fatty tissue under the skin of the abdomen, buttock or thigh. It is important to 
change the place where you have your injection every week to avoid damaging your skin. Your doctor 
or nurse will tell you the right dose and show you how to give the injection when you start treatment. 
Recommended dose 
Your doctor will work out your dose of Skytrofa from your body weight in kilograms. Because 
lonapegsomatropin is converted into somatropin in the body, doses of Skytrofa are described in terms 
of the amount of somatropin it produces. The recommended dose of Skytrofa is 0.24 mg somatropin 
per kilogram of body weight, given once a week.  
If changing from daily somatropin therapy to once-weekly Skytrofa, your doctor will tell you to wait 
at least 8 hours between the final dose of once-daily somatropin and the first dose of Skytrofa. The 
recommended dose may be reduced according to previous daily dose of somatropin. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When to use Skytrofa  
You need to inject Skytrofa once a week, on the same day each week, at any time during the day.  
If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly injection. Skytrofa can be administered 2 days 
before or 2 days after the scheduled dosing day. There should be at least 5 days since your last 
injection, on the old day and the first dose on the new day. After selecting a new dosing day, continue 
giving yourself the injection on that day each week. Ask your doctor if you are not sure how to do this. 
Preparation and administration 
Read “Instructions for use” at the end of this leaflet before you start using this medicine.  
Skytrofa comes in a two-chamber cartridge containing both medicine (powder) and a solvent (liquid). 
It is to be used with the needles supplied. To give injections, you also need a Skytrofa Auto-Injector. 
The Skytrofa Auto-Injector is supplied separately.  
The powder and solvent will be mixed together into a solution for injection by the Skytrofa 
Auto-Injector. After mixing, the solution is ready for use and the medicine can be injected under the 
skin using the Skytrofa Auto-Injector. 
Read the instructions for use provided with the Skytrofa Auto-Injector. 
If you or your child use more than you should 
If you have injected more Skytrofa than you should have, contact your doctor for advice. If you inject 
too much Skytrofa, your blood sugar level may fall too low and later rise too high. Long-term 
overdose could cause irregular growth. 
If you or your child forget to use Skytrofa  
If you miss your weekly dose and you are 1 or 2 days late: inject today, then on your usual day next 
week. If you are 3 days late or more: skip the missed dose and then resume injections on your next 
usual dosing day. Leave at least 5 clear days between injections. 
If you or your child stop using Skytrofa  
Do not stop using Skytrofa without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking Skytrofa prematurely, 
your growth rate may decline, and your final height may be less than if you had completed the full 
course of treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

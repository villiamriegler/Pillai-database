2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a generic version of pemetrexed powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion. Pemetrexed medac 100 mg, 500 mg or 1000 mg Powder for Concentrate for Solution for 
Infusion has the same active substance and the same excipients in comparable amounts the centrally 
approved reference medicinal product Alimta (EU/1/04/290/001-002).  
The claimed indications for this generic application are: 
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Pemetrexed medac in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve 
patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Pemetrexed medac in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell 
histology. 
Pemetrexed medac is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients 
whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Pemetrexed medac is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
As monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin the recommended dose of Pemetrexed medac is 
500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on 
the first day of each 21-day cycle. 
Pemetrexed medac must be reconstituted and further diluted prior to use. After reconstitution, each 
strength of the proposed product contains 25 mg/ml of pemetrexed. 
About the product 
Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial 
folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/671085/2015 
Page 6/24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mode of action 
In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting 
thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of 
thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate 
carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly 
and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase.  
The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. 
Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a 
lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life 
resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 100 
mg/vial, 500 mg/vial or 1000 mg/vial of pemetrexed (as pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate) as 
active substance. After reconstitution, the three presentations result in 25 mg/ml of pemetrexed. 
Other ingredients are mannitol, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. 
The product is available in Type I glass vials with rubber (bromobutyl rubber coated with 
fluoropolymer) stoppers as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate is N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-
oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid disodium hemipentahydrate and 
has the following structure: 
The structure has been confirmed by elemental analysis, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR and 13C-NMR) spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy 
and identification by chiral HPLC. 
The active substance is white or almost white hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble in water, 
slightly soluble in methanol and insoluble chloroform. Its molecular weight is 516.4 gmol-1, 
corresponding to the general molecular formula C20H19N5O6Na2·2.5H2O.  
Assessment report  
EMA/671085/2015

Pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate is an optically active compound due to the stereogenic centre 
of the glutaminic acid part. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. Pemetrexed 
disodium can exist in an amorphous form or different hydrated forms (pseudo-polymorphs). The most 
relevant crystalline forms are the hemipentahydrate and the heptahydrate (which has a Ph. Eur. 
monograph). The form routinely produced by the proposed manufacturing processes is the 
hemipentahydrate form, as supported by XRPD analysis, thermal (DSC) and water content. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. Two ASMFs support the application for Pemetrexed medac.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
As described above, the synthesis of pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate is documented in two 
ASMFs supporting this procedure.  
Although not identical, both manufacturing methods are quite similar and start from well-defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications. Starting materials in both ASMFs were re-defined 
during the procedure to ensure that steps critical to the quality of the active substance are described in 
the dossier.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Active substance from 
both sources is released against the same set of specifications. Batch data indicates that active 
substance from both sources performs equivalently in secondary manufacture and produces finished 
product of equivalent quality.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. Due to its use in advanced cancer therapy, the absence of a 
full discussion on genotoxic impurities is accepted in accordance with ICH-M7. 
The active substance is packaged by one of the manufacturers into a polyethylene bag filled with an 
inert gas tightly sealed with a cable tie, which is placed into a second polyethylene bag and a heat 
sealed aluminium/LDPE bag. This bag is then placed into a HDPE container. The other manufacturer 
packs the active substance in doubly heat-sealed LDPE bags with an intermediate silica gel pouch, 
packed inside a triple laminated sunlight barrier bag and stored inside an HDPE drum. All materials 
comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMFs and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
A unified specification is provided for active substance from both sources by the finished product 
manufacturer, and is based on the Ph. Eur. monograph for the heptahydrate salt. The active substance 
specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC, sodium test (Ph. Eur.)), clarity, colour 
and pH of solution (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents 
(GC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and 
microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.). 
Assessment report  
EMA/671085/2015 
Page 8/24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information on the 
reference standards have been provided in both ASMFs. 
Batch analysis data on three commercial scale batches of the active substance from one manufacturer 
and eight from the other were provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on eight commercial scale batches of active substance from one of the ASMF holder 
stored in the intended commercial package for up 36 months under long term conditions (5 ºC ± 3 
ºC), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (15 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 3 months 
under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. The 
parameters tested were description, identification, water content, clarity and appearance of solution, 
pH, D-isomer content, related compounds, assay, bacterial endotoxin and microbial limit. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. Out of specification 
results were observed for impurities under accelerated conditions, but no significant trends were 
observed under intermediate or long term conditions. Forced degradation studies (base hydrolysis, acid 
hydrolysis, oxidation, thermal degradation) including photostability were performed on one batch. It 
was concluded that the active substance is sensitive to base, acid oxidation but stable to thermal 
degradation. A minor amount of an oxidation impurity was formed during photostability testing, but all 
results were within the specification.No racemisation occurred under any condition. For the active 
substance from this source, the stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months at 5 ºC 
stored in its original packaging for the active substance from this source. 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the other ASMF holder 
stored in the intended commercial package for up 36 months under long term conditions (5 ºC ± 3 
ºC), and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), according to the ICH 
guidelines, were provided. The parameters tested were appearance, enantiomeric purity, clarity, colour 
and pH of solution, water content, assay, and impurities. The analytical methods used were the same 
as for release and were stability indicating. No significant trends in any of the parameters tested were 
observed under accelerated or long term conditions. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline 
Q1B and forced degradation studies (base and acid hydrolysis, oxidation and UV exposure) were 
performed on one batch. It was concluded that the active substance is photostable under the 
conditions tested and sensitive to base, acid and oxidation. The stability results justify the proposed 
retest period of 36 months stored in its original packaging under argon or nitrogen atmosphere at 5 ºC 
± 3 ºC in the proposed container, for the active substance from this source. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a finished product equivalent to Alimta.  
The same disodium salt as in the reference medicinal product is used. As mentioned above, a different 
hydrate form than the one used in the reference medicinal product is used for Pemetrexed medac. 
Since the active substance is fully solubilised during the manufacture of the finished product, this has 
no impact. Therefore a biowaiver can be granted from the quality point of view. 
Assessment report  
EMA/671085/2015 
Page 9/24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As the active substance is sensitive to oxidation and vulnerable to hydrolysis in aqueous environment it 
is formulated as a lyophilised powder, and stored under nitrogen in type I glass vials as the reference 
medicinal product. The product is manufactured and stored under an inert atmosphere to prevent 
oxidation of the bulk solution and the final product. Terminal sterilisation by heat or radiation was 
deemed to be unsuitable due to instability of the finished product. Thus, the finished product is 
manufactured by sterile filtration followed by aseptic processing. 
The excipients used in the formulation are the same as for the reference medicinal product, namely 
mannitol (bulking agent), HCl and NaOH (pH adjusting agents). All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC. 
Pemetrexed medac 100 mg/vial and 500 mg/vial presentations are dose and qualitatively identical to 
the reference medicinal product. For Pemetrexed medac, an additional, dose-proportional 1000 mg/vial 
presentation has been developed. The 100 mg/vial presentation contains an over-fill of 5% in order to 
allow correct dosing. The reconstitution method is adequately described in section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
There is no overfill in the 500mg/vial and 1000mg/vial presentations. 
With regards to the manufacturing process development, the same composition of the bulk solution 
was used for the manufacture of the three presentations. It was demonstrated that 50 mg/ml bulk 
solutions of pemetrexed and mannitol were stable when stored at 25 °C in the dark, and no 
precipitation occurred when stored in the fridge for 24 hours. Therefore, this concentration was 
selected for further development. The lyophilisation process development was discussed in depth and 
included the evaluation of electrical resistance and freezing/melting properties, as well as 
crystallization studies. With respect to the filling dose and vial dimensions, the 500 mg presentation 
was deemed to be the most critical in terms of filling height and vial diameter. Therefore, this 
presentation was used for the development trials, which focused on: low content of residual water in 
the final product; short reconstitution time; colour and clarity of the reconstituted solution; aspect of 
the lyophilized cake; process economy.Overall, the combination of fast freezing with annealing allowed 
preparing the lyophilized matrix with the desired physicochemical properties and adequate stability. 
Based on these results, the freeze drying cycle for the 500 mg/vial presentation was scaled up and 
adjusted for the 100 mg/vial and 1000 mg/vial presentations. 
Since the finished product is administered as an aqueous intravenous solution (0.9% NaCl as stated in 
the SmPC) with the same concentration as Alimta, the excipients are qualitatively and quantitatively 
equivalent, and the active substance is freely soluble in aqueous media, no bioequivalence study was 
conducted. 
The primary packaging is a colourless type I glass vial with a rubber lyo stopper and aluminum cap 
with flip-top. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process involves the following steps: bulk solution preparation; sterile filtration of 
the bulk solution; filling; lyophilisation; capping of the vials. The process is considered to be a non-
standard manufacturing process. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. They consist of pH at compounding, filter integrity test before and after filtration, bioburden

before pre-filtration and before sterile filtration, nitrogen filter integrity, fill weight, container closure 
integrity and oxygen content after capping. 
Process validation was carried out on three validation batches per strength. The data presented 
demonstrate that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including appearance, reconstitution time, colour, clarity and pH of reconstituted solution (Ph. Eur.), 
particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial-scale batches of each presentation of the 
finished product (100 mg/vial, 500 mg/vial and 1000 mg/vial) confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of the finished product stored under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 24 months, and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided for 100 mg/vial and 500 mg/vial presentations. For the 1000 mg/vial presentation, 12 
months long term and 6 months accelerated stability data were provided. Vials were stored upright. 
The batches of finished product were manufactured at the proposed commercial site and were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, reconstitution 
time, colour, clarity and pH of reconstituted solution, particulate contamination, water content, 
identification, assay, impurities and sterility. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No 
significant trends were observed in any of the presentations and conditions tested.  
In addition, one batch of each of the presentations of the finished product was exposed to light as 
defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. All results 
remained within the specifications and no significant trends were observed.  
In addition, an in-use stability study was carried out on one batch of each presentation after 
reconstitution with the prescribed volume of saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) in an inverted vial. 
It revealed a slight assay decrease and an increase of an unspecified impurity, but the solution 
remained within the specification for up to 24 hours.  
Compatibility studies with the infusion bag were performed on the two most extreme dilutions (20 
mg/ml and 2 mg/ml). The reconstituted samples were stored for 24 hours in the dark at 2-8 ºC or in 
daylight at ambient temperature. Although a slight decrease in assay and an increase in an unspecified 
impurity was observed in some of the samples stored in daylight all results remained within the 
specification limits.

Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 36 months without any special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC is acceptable, and specific instructions for use have been included in section 6.3 of 
the SmPC.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. As requested by the CHMP, the applicant redefined the 
proposed starting materials to ensure that all critical steps of the synthetic process are described in the 
dossier. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Pemetrexed Medac manufactured by Medac Gesellschaft für klinische Spezialpraparate 
mbH is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
pemetrexed containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, 
the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of pemetrexed are well known. No 
non-clinical data are submitted with this application. Published literature has been reviewed and is 
considered of suitable quality.  
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing pemetrexed.  
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of pemetrexed based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the 
SmPC of the reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
Exemption  
Pemetrexed medac has the same active substance, indications, route of administration, method of 
administration, instructions for reconstitution with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for 
injection without preservatives, dosage form and posology as Alimta.  
Alimta is available in two presentations in the European market: 100 mg/vial and 500 mg/vial of 
pemetrexed (as pemetrexed disodium). 
The proposed presentations of Pemetrexed medac are: 100 mg/vial, 500 mg/vial and 1000 mg/vial. 
The composition of Pemetrexed medac 100 mg and 500 mg vial and Alimta 100 mg and 500 mg vial 
are similar. Excipients used in the 100 and 500 mg formulations are qualitatively the same than the 
originator. 
The 1000 mg formulation is not available for the originator product but the qualitative composition of 
the new presentation, 1000 mg/vial, is comparable to the composition of the 100 mg and 500 mg 
vials. 
All the formulations should be reconstituted with sodium hydrochloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for 
injection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. 
Biowaiver 
No bioequivalence studies have been submitted. 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), 
bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the product is to be administered as an aqueous IV 
solution containing the same active drug substance in the same concentration as the currently 
authorised product. Pemetrexed solution is intended for IV use and contains the same active drug 
substance in a concentration (25 mg/mL) similar to the concentration of 100 mg/vial and 500 mg/vial 
presentations of Alimta and therefore, no bioequivalence studies are required.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No new pharmacokinetic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Pemetrexed medac, 100 mg and 500 mg, powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, has the 
same active substance as the reference medicinal product, Alimta. The same salt (sodium) is used as 
in the innovator’s product. The only difference between the reference product Alimta and the test 
product is the hydratation of the salt of the active substance which do not raise any concern regarding 
efficacy and safety. There are no excipients interacting with the drug substance, the disposition of the 
drug substance is therefore not affected. Furthermore, Pemetrexed medac has the same indications, 
posology, pharmaceutical form, route of administration, method of administration, instructions for 
reconstitution with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection without preservatives and 
strength after reconstitution as Alimta when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the 
SmPC. 
Although a new presentation of 1000 mg is introduced by the Applicant compared to the reference 
product, the application is still considered to be a generic application as the reconstituted product has 
the same concentration as the reference product regardless of the presentation. Therefore, the 
introduction of the 1000 mg presentation is considered acceptable. 
There are no concerns with Pemetrexed medac from a clinical efficacy point of view. 
No new studies have been conducted and none are required under the provisions of the Note for 
Guidance on the investigation of Bioequivalence and Bioavailability (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev. 1): 
“Bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered as an 
aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved 
product”. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Pemetrexed medac and justifications that 
the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the 
reference product was provided and is deemed acceptable and sufficiently up-to-date. This is in 
accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical/bioequivalence studies were not 
considered necessary. The CHMP considers that there are no objections to approval of Pemetrexed 
medac 100 mg, 500 mg and 1000 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion from a clinical 
point of view.

Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.  
The 1000 mg strength does not exist for the reference originator Alimta. Therefore, PRAC and CHMP 
estimate that, even if not listed as a specific risk in the RMP of Pemetrexed medac, the risk of 
medication error should be under specific surveillance by the MAH. Should a significant increase in the 
frequency of reported medication errors be detected, the MAH should report this as a signal. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures.

includes the following information: 
4.2 Posology and method of administration: 
“To reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed 
must also receive vitamin supplementation (see 
section 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a 
multivitamin containing folic acid (350 – 1,000 μg) on 
a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be 
taken during the seven days preceding the first dose of 
pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full 
course of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose 
of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an 
intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1,000 μg) in 
the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and 
once every three cycles thereafter. Subsequent 
vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same day 
as pemetrexed.” 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use:  
“(…), all patients treated with pemetrexed must be 
instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a 
prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related 
toxicity (…).” 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
includes the following information: 
4.2 Posology and method of administration: 
“Patients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored 
before each dose with a complete blood count, 
including a differential white cell count (WCC) and 
platelet count. Prior to each chemotherapy 
administration blood chemistry tests should be 
collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function.” 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use: 
“Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency 
(creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) should 
avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, and aspirin (> 1.3 g 
daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days 
following pemetrexed administration (…).” 
“In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency 
eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs with long 
elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 
5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least 2 days 
following pemetrexed administration (…).” 
“Serious renal events, including acute renal failure, 
have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in 
association with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many 
of the patients in whom these occurred had underlying 
risk factors for the development of renal events 
including dehydration or pre-existing hypertension or 
diabetes.” 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and 
other forms of interaction 
“In patients with normal renal function (creatinine 
clearance ≥ 80 ml/min), high doses of non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen 
> 1600 mg/day) and aspirin at higher dose (≥ 1.3 g 
daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, 
consequently, increase the occurrence of pemetrexed 
adverse events.  
Therefore, caution should be made when administering 
higher doses of NSAIDs or aspirin, concurrently with 
pemetrexed to patients with normal function

2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Alimta. The bridging report submitted by the applicant 
has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of pemetrexed powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The reference product Alimta is indicated for  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Alimta in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients with 
unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Alimta in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
Alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose disease 
has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance. However, the applicant 
provided a clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature 
which was considered sufficient. 
Bioequivalence testing with the reference product is not required under the provisions of the Guideline 
on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev.1) since the product is to be 
administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same 
concentration as the currently authorised product 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product Alimta can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Pemetrexed Medac in the following indications:

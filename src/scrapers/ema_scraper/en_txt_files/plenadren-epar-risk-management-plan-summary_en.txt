Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan     
Summary 
(hydrocortisone) 
of 
risk  management  plan 
for 
PLENADREN 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for PLENADREN. The RMP details important risks 
of PLENADREN, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
PLENADREN's risks and uncertainties (missing information).  
PLENADREN’ssummary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how PLENADREN should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for PLENADREN should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of  PLENADREN’s 
RMP.  
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
PLENADREN is authorised for the treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults. It contains hydrocortisone 
as the active substance and it is given by oral route as 5 mg and 20 mg modified-release tablets. 
Further information about the evaluation of PLENADREN’s benefits can be found in PLENADREN’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website, 
under the medicine’s webpage:  https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/plenadren  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of PLENADREN, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about PLENADREN’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
(a) Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
(b) Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
(c) The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
(d) The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR/PBRER  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  PLENADREN  is  not  yet  available,  it  is  listed 
under missing information below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  PLENADREN  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can 
be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of 
a link with the use of PLENADREN. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of 
this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product 
that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important  identified  risk:  Cortisol  deficiency-related  symptoms  after  change  from 
immediate release hydrocortisone 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
The highest frequency of cortisol deficiency-related AEs was 
observed  in  the  beginning  of  the  PLENADREN  treatment 
period (weeks 0–4) when 13% of the patients reported any 
such  AE  compared  to  8%  during  weeks  0–4  on  t.i.d. 
treatment. The pattern of higher frequency of AEs assessed 
as  possibly  cortisol  deficiency-related  initially  after  change 
was observed also in the newly recruited patients in Study 
DC  08/01  with  5  of  the  possibly  cortisol  deficiency-related 
AEs  reported  by  5  newly  recruited  patients  (31%)  and  17 
AEs reported by 13 patients recruited from Study DC 06/02 
(24%) from 0 to 6 months.

No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been performed to

associated  with  the  hydrocortisone  class  of  glucocorticoid  drugs 
are  listed  in  the  SmPC  based  on  a  literature  review  of 
pharmacological doses of hydrocortisone.

Unknown.  The  Clinical  Study  Programme  has  not  demonstrated 
any  drug  interactions  with  either  potent  CYP3A4  inducers  or 
inhibitors during treatment with MR-HC.

Risk factors and risk groups 
MR-HC is currently not indicated in children in the EU. Off label use 
in  children  and/or  adolescents  with  CAH  cannot  be  excluded  as 
currently o.d. glucocorticoid replacement therapy for this disease 
does not exist. Off label use in adults cannot be fully excluded for 
layman concepts such as ‘adrenal fatigue’. However, as this is not 
a medically recognised condition the risk for off label use in adults 
is considered very low as MR-HC is a prescription drug.

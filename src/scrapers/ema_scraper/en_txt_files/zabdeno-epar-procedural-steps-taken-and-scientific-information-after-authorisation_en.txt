The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations and the impact of the data 
submitted by the MAH on the benefit/risk profile of the 
medicinal product, concluded that marketing authorisation 
of Zabdeno should be maintained. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Grouped application comprising three type II 
variations as follows: 
- Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in 
order to add crying and hyperhidrosis to the list of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in children with 
frequency very common and common, respectively 
and to add immunogenicity data from study 
VAC52150EBL2004 (PREVAC), listed as a Study 3 in 
the agreed PIP. This was a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2 study 
conducted at multiple sites in West Africa to 
investigate the immunogenicity and safety of 3 Ebola 
vaccine regimens versus placebo in adults (aged ≥18 
years), adolescents (aged 12-17 years), and children 
(2 age strata: 5-11 years and 1-4 years) who never 
received a candidate Ebola vaccine (self-report) and 
had no history of Ebola virus disease (self-report). 
- Update of sections 4.2. 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to 
add interim safety and immunogenicity data from 
study VAC52150EBL2005, a study conducted by the 
MAH in infants 4-11 months of age. 
- Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to add 
final safety and immunogenicity data from study 
VAC52150EBL2011, a study in which an Ad26.ZEBOV 
booster dose was evaluated in children 1 to 11 years 
of age (at the time of first vaccination in EBL3001). 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce 
editorial changes and update the contact details of 
the local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lenalidomide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In  view  of  the  large  number  of  cases  of  pulmonary  hypertension  collected  in  the  cumulative  review, 
including cases with a suggestive chronology and positive dechallenge, and considering that there is a 
plausible mechanism of action and a possible class effect, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship 
between  lenalidomide  and  pulmonary  hypertension  is  plausible.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product 
information of products containing lenalidomide should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lenalidomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lenalidomide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

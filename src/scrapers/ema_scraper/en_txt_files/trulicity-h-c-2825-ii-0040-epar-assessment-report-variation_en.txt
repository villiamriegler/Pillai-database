1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 5 April 2019 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested:

C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include the new indication for Trulicity; “to reduce the risk of major adverse 
cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke), in 
adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors without established 
cardiovascular disease, and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular 
disease.”  
The data supporting this new indication is derived from Study GBDJ (Researching Cardiovascular Events 
with a Weekly INcretin in Diabetes (REWIND)); a single pivotal Phase 3 long-term cardiovascular 
outcomes study, which assessed the efficacy and safety of treatment with once-weekly injection of 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg when added to glucose-lowering regimen of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), 
compared to the addition of a once weekly placebo injection. This study is a post-authorisation measure 
(PAM) (MEA 004) included in the dulaglutide RMP.  
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are proposed to be updated and the 
Package Leaflet is proposed to be updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH is taking the opportunity to update the wording of the existing indication in section 
4.1 of the SmPC and to implement a minor change in section 5.1 of the SmPC, in the glycaemic control 
summary subsection, based on the results from the dulaglutide study as add-on to sodium-glucose 
co-transporter 2 inhibitor therapy which was assessed as part of II/25.  
An updated RMP version 3.1 was provided as part of the application. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0227/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and the granting of a 
(product-specific) waiver.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0227/2016  was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Dulaglutide (Trulicity) is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 90% amino 
acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1 that exhibits GLP-1-mediated effects, including 
glucose-dependent potentiation of insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, delay of gastric 
emptying, and weight loss. 
As of 31 December 2018, dulaglutide 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg is approved in 74 countries for once-weekly 
subcutaneous administration as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The pharmacological class is incretin mimetic. 
This application concerns Study H9X-MC-GBDJ, also known as REWIND (Researching cardiovascular 
Events with a Weekly INcretin in Diabetes), a Phase 3, multicenter, international, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that was conducted to assess the superiority of 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg s.c. once weekly compared with placebo on the incidence of major adverse 
cardiovascular (CV) events (MACE; death from CV causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal 
stroke) when added to the existing antihyperglycemic regimen in patients with T2D.  
The Applicant proposes that the results of the cardiovascular outcome trial (REWIND) can be used to 
support the following new therapeutic indication: 
“Trulicity is indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) 
• in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors without established 
cardiovascular disease 
• in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease (see section 5.1).” 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Dulaglutide is a biological consisting of a peptide fused to an antibody fragment by a linker. All 
components consist of natural proteinogenic amino acids. It is assumed that the protein or peptide part 
will not be excreted in unchanged form and will not reach the environment. An environmental risk 
assessment is therefore not required.  
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, dulaglutide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The cardiovascular outcome study (Study H9X-MC-GBDJ/ REWIND) was performed in accordance with 
GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The assessment of Study GBDJ (REWIND) did not reveal concerns regarding GCP non-compliance. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Title of Study 
The Effect of Dulaglutide on Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: Researching 
Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly INcretin in Diabetes (REWIND/ Study H9X-MC-GBDJ). 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that once weekly s.c. injection of dulaglutide 1.5 mg 
reduces the occurrence of the composite primary endpoint of death from cardiovascular (CV) causes, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke when added to the glucose-lowering regimen of 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), compared to the addition of a once-weekly placebo injection.

Study Design 
Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) was a Phase 3, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that assessed the effect of dulaglutide 1.5 mg s.c. once weekly 
compared to placebo on major adverse CV events in patients with T2D when added to their existing 
antihyperglycemic regimen. All eligible patients participated in a 3-week, single-blind, placebo run-in 
period. Patients who were adherent to study drug (placebo) during the run-in period were randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio to either dulaglutide 1.5 mg or placebo, injected subcutaneously once weekly. After 
randomization, patients were followed up for CV outcomes and other measures at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 
months, and then followed up at approximately 6-month intervals. Patients were to be followed-up until 
approximately 1200 patients experienced a Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC)-adjudicated 3-component 
MACE. The median follow-up time of this study was 5.4 years.

Other measures included vital signs (blood pressure [systolic and diastolic] and heart rate) and 
anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and waist/hip circumference), laboratory analytes, 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuations due to 
adverse events (AEs), and safety evaluation of adjudication results of all deaths. 
Statistical methods 
The analysis methods were defined in the study SAP, which was finalized prior to the interim analysis. 
Primary efficacy and safety analyses were conducted on the ITT population. This population included all 
randomized patients within the treatment group to which they were assigned, regardless of whether or 
not they took study drug or the correct study drug. 
Analyses were also conducted using the Per-Protocol (PP) population.  
The primary analyses of the primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints were based on adjudicated 
events that occurred after randomization. The primary analysis model was a Cox proportional hazards 
regression model for the time to the first occurrence of a 3-component MACE, with treatment as a fixed 
effect. Analyses were performed for the composite endpoint as well as for each of the components. The 
hazard ratio (dulaglutide/placebo) and the associated 95% CI (adjusted for interim analysis) were 
derived based on the Cox model. The between-treatment comparisons were based on the p-value from 
the Cox model. Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of the survival curve for each treatment were generated. 
Patients who completed the study but did not experience an outcome were censored on the last day of 
their follow-up. Patients who discontinued from the study were censored on their discontinuation dates or 
their last contact dates, whichever was later. Patients who died during the study were censored as of the 
date of death for all time-to-event analyses where death is not an outcome of interest. Patients who 
prematurely discontinued their assigned treatment were followed up until the end of the study. 
Unless otherwise noted, all tests of treatment effects were conducted at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, and 
CIs were calculated at a 2-sided 95% confidence level. 
An O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function was used to control the Type I error across the interim and 
final analyses for the testing of the primary endpoint. The interim analysis for efficacy was performed 
when 756 patients had at least 1 event of the 3-component MACE, using an α=0.009. The interim 
analysis was performed by an independent statistical analysis center supporting the IDMC. The IDMC 
recommendation was to continue the study without alteration. The full alpha for the final analysis 
(adjusted for the interim analysis) with 1257 patients with 3-component MACE events was α=0.0467.  
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019  
Page 9/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A graphical approach for multiple comparisons (Bretz et al. 2009, 2011) was used to strongly control the 
overall Type I error (2-sided alpha of 0.05) for testing the null hypothesis of no-treatment effect with 
respect to the secondary endpoints. 
For adjudicated outcomes, the incidence rate per 100 person-years of follow-up was calculated for each 
treatment group. The numerator was the number of patients with the event, and the denominator was the 
event-specific total person-years of follow-up, divided by 100. Total person-years of follow-up was the 
sum, over patients, of the time on study until the first outcome (first event time or censoring time). The 
absolute risk difference (ARD) was then calculated by subtracting the incidence in the dulaglutide group 
from that in the placebo group. 
For continuous measures, mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) were used to analyze 
changes from baseline with the treatment as a fixed effect and the baseline value as the covariate. The 
MMRM model also included visit and the treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and the patient as 
a random effect. 
As sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint and individual components were analysed based on a model 
stratified by site, an on-treatment analysis was performed, silent MI events were excluded, an analysis 
considering non-CV death as a competing risk factor was performed, an analysis adjusted for relevant 
baseline characteristics was conducted, an analysis stratified by baseline concomitant medications was 
performed, and a PP analysis. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the pre-specified subgroup variables gender, age, duration of 
diabetes, BMI, baseline HbA1c, region, and prior CV event. 
Results 
Recruitment 
Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) was conducted at 371 study centers in 24 countries. The first patient was 
enrolled on 22 July 2011 and the last patient completed the last visit on 21 August 2018. 
Study population  
The study population included patients with a mean HbA1c of 7.3% ± 1.1 at baseline. The population 
ranged from newly diagnosed patients to patients with a maximum diabetes duration of 55.5 years (the 
mean duration of diabetes was 10.5 years). 
The majority (62.8%) of patients enrolled in Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) did not have clinically 
manifest cardiovascular disease but did have multiple cardiovascular risk factors, while 31.5% of patients 
did have prior cardiovascular disease. For 5.7% of patients, baseline information regarding prior 
cardiovascular disease was missing or unknown. 
Patient Disposition and Sample size 
A sample size of approximately 9600 patients was required to show superiority of dulaglutide over 
placebo (with 90% power). A total of 9901 patients were randomized to either dulaglutide or placebo. A 
total of 9867 (99.7%) patients were study completers (endpoint completers or vital status only 
completers). A total of 9610 (97.1%) patients were endpoint completers (experienced a primary MACE 
endpoint, died of non-CV causes, or completed study) and 257 patients were vital status only completers. 
A total of 1257 patients experienced at least 1 adjudicated primary 3-component MACE events 
(dulaglutide; n=594, placebo; n=663).

Duration of Follow-up 
The median follow-up time of Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) was 5.4 years. 
Adherence to the Study Treatment 
The majority of patients in Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) were adherent to study drug (dulaglutide, 
89.3%; placebo, 91.3%). 
Demographics and Baseline CV Risk Characteristics 
Demographic characteristics and relevant baseline CV risk characteristics were comparable and well 
balanced between the 2 treatment groups. 
Use of Concomitant Medication 
The use of concomitant medication is shown in the Figure below. The majority of patients were taking: 
•  Antihypertensives (dulaglutide: 93.5%; placebo: 94.0%) 
•  Antihyperglycemics (dulaglutide: 94.6%; placebo: 94.7%), and 
• 
Lipid-lowering agents (dulaglutide: 70.7%; placebo: 70.4%) 
•  Antithrombotic Agents (dulaglutide: 58.7%; placebo: 58.7%) 
•  Aspirin (dulaglutide: 51.7%; placebo: 51.6%) 
Assessment report

Patients on antihyperglycemic agents were primarily taking medications from either 1 (37.6%) or 2 
(46.6%) classes; very few patients were taking 3 or more antihyperglycemic medication classes at 
baseline (10.5%), which did not differ between the 2 treatment groups. A high proportion of patients 
were taking metformin (81.2%) and sulfonylureas (46%) at baseline and a small proportion of patients 
were taking insulins (23.9%), which is consistent with the low mean HbA1c levels of the patients at 
baseline. Baseline use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose transporter-2 
(SGLT-2) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones was limited. The proportions of patients taking ACE inhibitors/ 
angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, aspirin, and beta-blockers at baseline were 81.5%, 66.1%, 
51.7%, and 45.6%, respectively. 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
During the REWIND study (median follow-up time 5.4 years), a total of 1257 patients with T2D had at 
least one primary 3-component MACE (death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke): 
12.0% (594/4949) of patients on dulaglutide vs. 13.4% (663/4952) of patients on placebo. 
Once-weekly dulaglutide was superior to placebo for reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint 
of 3-component MACE (death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) when added to the 
standard-of-care treatment of adult patients with T2D at risk for CV events (hazard ratio [95.33% 
confidence interval (CI), after adjustment for the interim analysis]): 0.88 [0.79, 0.99], p=0.026).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is based on the recently completed study REWIND. The REWIND study was an adequately 
designed multicenter, double-blind cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) with the 3-component MACE as 
primary composite efficacy endpoint (and components of the composite primary endpoint as key 
secondary endpoints). Other endpoints investigated (all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure 
or for unstable angina, HbA1c, body weight, blood pressure) are likewise considered relevant. 
The study was conducted in 9901 adult T2DM patients (randomized in 1:1 ratio to dulaglutide 1.5 mg s.c. 
once weekly or placebo). The inclusion and exclusion criteria identified patients at different degrees of risk 
for CV events including patients with age ≥50 years and established clinical vascular disease, ≥55 years 
and subclinical vascular disease, or age ≥60 years and at least 2 risk factors for CVD. Patients with 
previous or newly diagnosed T2D were eligible to enroll in the study, and patients were required to have 
HbA1c ≤9.5% (no lower limit) at baseline.  
Adherence to study treatment was high (approximately 90%) and almost all randomized patients 
completed the study (99.7% had vital status ascertained, and 97.1% had complete assessment of the 
primary endpoint status). This supports the reliability of the data. 
As in other GLP-1 RA CVOTs, intensification of the concomitant treatment regimens was allowed for the 
management of glycemic control or other CV risk factors as required. 
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the impact of several key variables on the 
composite primary MACE endpoint. The statistical methodology is considered generally acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
There were no relevant imbalances between treatment groups with regard to demographic and baseline 
characteristics.  
Mean HbA1c was 7.3% (± 1.1) at baseline. The majority of patients did not have prior CVD (62.8%), 
while 31.5% of patients had evidence of prior CVD at baseline and for 5.7% of patients it was unknown, 
whether they had prior CVD or not. Other cardiovascular outcome studies investigated a population at 
higher risk for cardiovascular events; however, definitions for cardiovascular disease differed between 
studies. 
A minority of patients had evidence of renal dysfunction at baseline (22.2% of patients had eGFR<60 
mL/min/1.73 m2), 27.9% had microalbuminuria, and 8.4% had macroalbuminuria. 
The median follow-up time of this study was 5.4 years, which is longer than the follow-up period in other 
cardiovascular outcome studies (e. g. 3.8 years in LEADER, 2.1 in SUSTAIN-6). 
Patients on antihyperglycemic agents were primarily taking medications from either 1 (37.6%) or 2 
(46.6%) classes; very few patients were taking 3 or more antihyperglycemic medication classes at 
baseline (10.5%), which did not differ between the 2 treatment groups. A high proportion of patients in 
Study GBDJ were taking metformin (81.2%) and sulfonylureas (46%) at baseline and a small proportion 
of patients were taking insulins (23.9%), which is consistent with the low mean HbA1c levels of the 
patients at baseline. Baseline use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose 
transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones was limited. 
Post-baseline, fewer patients in the dulaglutide treatment group reported use of antihypertensive and 
antihyperglycemic medications compared to placebo; no other notable differences between treatment 
groups were observed for other medication categories.

The primary analysis assessed the reduction of the incidence of 3-component MACE with dulaglutide 
compared to placebo. Superiority was confirmed for dulaglutide compared to placebo, and the hazard 
ratio for the 3-component MACE (death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) was significantly 
lower for patients in the dulaglutide group compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio [95.33% CI]) 
(0.88 [0.79, 0.99]); p=0.026. 
Over multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses, there was consistency of effect on the primary 
3-component MACE endpoint across clinically relevant factors, including age, baseline HbA1c, duration of 
diabetes, and renal function. Of note, the effect of dulaglutide treatment was consistent, favoring 
dulaglutide, in the subpopulations of patients with or without a prior CV event. 
The results of important secondary endpoints showed results consistent with the finding on the primary 
endpoint and showed a greater contribution of non-fatal stroke to the significant result of the primary 
analysis compared to cardiovascular death and non-fatal MI, where effects were rather modest: the 
incidence rate per 100 person-years of CV death was 1.22 patients with events for dulaglutide compared 
to 1.34 patients with events for placebo (HR 0.91); the incidence rate per 100 person-years of all-cause 
mortality was 2.06 patients with events for dulaglutide compared to 2.29 patients with events for placebo 
(HR 0.90); the incidence rate per 100 person-years of MI (nonfatal) was 0.80 patients with events for 
dulaglutide and 0.84 patients with events for placebo (HR 0.96); the incidence rate per 100 person-years 
of stroke (nonfatal) was 0.52 patients with events for dulaglutide compared to 0.69 patients. 
As regards hospitalization for heart failure and hospitalisation for unstable angina results between 
dulaglutide and placebo can be regarded comparable (despite the fact, that there were slightly more 
events for HUA in the dulaglutide arm as compared to placebo, a finding that is not further pursued). 
The dulaglutide group had a 16% lower hazard for the composite nephropathy endpoint (≥30% eGFR 
decline, renal replacement therapy, or macroalbuminuria) compared to the placebo group. 
All of the 3 nephropathy components contributed to this effect with hazard ratios <1, but the primary 
contributing component was the development of macroalbuminuria with a 21% lower risk for the 
dulaglutide group. The effect of dulaglutide on reducing the onset of macroalbuminuria is also consistent 
with effects observed in previous dulaglutide studies (Tuttle et al. 2017, 2018) and other GLP-1 RAs 
(Marso et al. 2016; Mann et al. 2017). 
Mean HbA1c at baseline was similar between the treatment groups (dulaglutide 7.34%; placebo 7.35%). 
Post-baseline, HbA1c was significantly reduced in the dulaglutide-treated patients, but significantly 
increased in placebo-treated patients at all time points assessed. Over the duration of the study, the 
HbA1c differences between the dulaglutide and placebo treatment groups became smaller. The effect on 
HbA1c at month 60 can be regarded as modest, which might be explained by the intended low baseline 
HbA1c (7.3%), the comparably long observational period and less use of concomitant antihyperglycemic 
drugs as compared to placebo. 
Results on body weight, blood pressure and heart rate were consistent with previous dulaglutide studies 
that were designed to assess the efficacy and safety of dulaglutide for glycemic control, and the results 
are consistent with the descriptions in current labelling for the effects of dulaglutide on blood pressure 
and heart rate (Trulicity SmPC 2019): patients were moderately obese at study entry (mean baseline 
BMI, 32.3 kg/m2), with a mean weight of approximately 88.7 kg. During the study, weight was 
significantly reduced for patients of both treatment groups at all timepoints assessed. The LS mean 
change from baseline to Month 60 (± SE) was -3.47 kg ± 0.09 for dulaglutide (p<0.001) and -2.16 kg ± 
0.09 for placebo (p<0.001). Mean baseline values for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP), and heart rate were similar between the treatment groups. Post-baseline, significant 
decreases between baseline and month 60 were observed in both treatment groups for SBP (LS mean

change from baseline [± SE]: dulaglutide, -2.05 mmHg ± 0.23; placebo, -0.97 mmHg ± 0.23) and DBP 
(dulaglutide, -2.19 mmHg ± 0.14; placebo, -2.45 mmHg ± 0.14). Increases in heart rate between 
baseline and Month 60 were significant in both treatment groups (LS mean change from baseline [± SE]: 
dulaglutide, 1.87 beats/min ± 0.15; placebo, 0.49 beats/min ± 0.15); the increase in HR was 
significantly larger in the dulaglutide group compared to the placebo group. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) was a well-designed and well-conducted study in patients with a wide 
range of T2D disease severity and good glycemic control (mean HbA1c of 7.3% at baseline in both 
treatment groups), of whom a majority (62.8%) did not have established CVD at study initiation. 
Superiority of dulaglutide to placebo in reduction of the 3-component MACE endpoint compared to 
placebo was demonstrated. Results of secondary endpoints and in subgroups were consistent with the 
outcome of the primary analysis, further corroborating its validity. 
Based on these results, the MAH proposed an extension of indication to include a new indication for 
dulaglutide (Trulicity) within section 4.1 of SmPC: “to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular 
events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke), in adults with type 2 
diabetes mellitus who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular 
disease, and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease.” 
Albeit, as compared to previous cardiovascular outcome studies, baseline HbA1c was somewhat lower in 
REWIND and the number of patients without prior cardiovascular disease (primary prevention population) 
was higher, all patients included had T2DM. Thus, there is complete overlap between the already labelled 
indication and the indication envisaged with regard to the target population. 
Therefore, CHMP considered it not justified to include a separate reference in section 4.1 of the SmPC as 
applied by the MAH, as this population is already covered by the approved therapeutic indication. 
However the CHMP acknowledges the benefit in terms of cardiovascular outcome demonstrated in the 
REWIND and is therefore of the view that the current wording of the indication which only makes 
reference to the treatment goal “improvement of glycaemic control” does not fully reflect the 
demonstrated effects with dulaglutide. The wording “treatment of T2DM” was therefore considered more 
relevant in section 4.1 of the SmPC, as it encompasses both glycaemic control and results on clinical 
outcomes such as cardiovascular complications, and a cross-reference to section 5.1 of the SmPC where 
the study results of the REWIND are reflected.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety and tolerability of dulaglutide were investigated and documented in the original marketing 
authorisation application of dulaglutide for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
With this submission, information on the safety and tolerability of dulaglutide from the cardiovascular 
outcome trial (CVOT) – Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) is provided. 
Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) was the largest and longest clinical study to date within the dulaglutide 
clinical development program, contributing a total of 4949 dulaglutide and 4952 placebo-treated patients 
with T2D to the safety database. The median duration of follow-up (extent of the safety reporting period) 
for each treatment group was 5.4 years, translating to an overall 51,830.1 person-years of safety 
follow-up time. 
The MAH has not pooled safety data from Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) with data from the completed 
glucose-lowering studies of the dulaglutide clinical development program due to differences in 
Assessment report

the study designs, study populations, and study measures. Safety data from Study H9X-MC-GBDJ 
(REWIND) are discussed below, and conclusions are discussed within the context of existing data from the 
original dulaglutide T2DM clinical program. 
Methods 
Overview of Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) 
Safety measures collected 
Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) included evaluations of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
including serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths, and examination of several pre-specified adverse 
events of special interest (AESI): serious gastrointestinal (GI) events; acute pancreatitis; any cancer and 
in particular pancreatic cancer, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), thyroid C-cell hyperplasia, and thyroid 
carcinomas; severe hypoglycemia; immune-mediated reactions and serious allergic hypersensitivity 
reactions; serious hepatic events; clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias and CV conduction 
disorders; serious renal events; and discontinuation of study drug for any reason. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 9901 patients (dulaglutide: 4949; placebo: 4952) were randomized and included in the ITT 
population. 
The median follow-up time in the study, defined as the time from randomization to the final visit 
regardless of study drug use, was 65.1 months for dulaglutide and 65.0 months for placebo. The 
percentage of patients with follow-up time in study of 60 months or greater was similar between both 
groups (dulaglutide: 78.6%; placebo: 77.0%). 
The median treatment duration of study drug, defined as the time period over which the patient received 
study drug (irrespective of temporary study drug discontinuations), was 61.9 months for both treatment 
groups. The majority of patients were treated for 60 months or greater and the percentage was similar 
between both treatment groups (dulaglutide: 60.4%; placebo: 58.6%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019 
Page 20/49 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total follow-up time in the study was 26 029.81 person-years in the dulaglutide group and 25 800.27 
person-years in the placebo group. Total treatment duration was 21,940.27 person-years in the 
dulaglutide group and 21,973.76 person-years in the placebo group. 
No significant differences were observed between the treatment groups in follow-up time in study or 
treatment duration. 
Adverse events 
Primary, secondary, and additional CV efficacy endpoint events (e.g., death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, 
nonfatal stroke, all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure or an urgent heart failure visit, 
hospitalization for unstable angina, and revascularizations) were not required to be reported as AEs or 
SAEs unless the investigator deemed the event as related to study drug, drug delivery system, or study 
procedure. All of these efficacy endpoints were adjudicated and are discussed in the efficacy section of 
this report. 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
A total of 92.0% (n=9110) of patients experienced at least 1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) 
during the REWIND study. The high incidence of TEAEs was expected in this long-term cardiovascular 
outcome trial (median follow-up of 5.4 years) and given the age of the population enrolled (mean age 
66.2 ± 6.5 years). The events were balanced across the two treatment groups (dulaglutide: 4575 
[92.4%]; placebo: 4535 [91.6%]). 
When evaluating overall TEAEs by SOC, higher proportions of patients treated with dulaglutide, compared 
to placebo, experienced TEAEs in the following system organ classes (SOCs): 
•  GI disorders: This result was primarily driven by higher incidence of nausea, diarrhea, constipation, 
and vomiting. Dulaglutide is known to cause GI events, especially within the first several weeks of 
administration, so higher incidences of nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting TEAEs in the 
dulaglutide patients were anticipated. These events were reported at a similar frequency as in the 
original application and are captured as adverse reactions in the Trulicity labels (Trulicity SmPC 
2019). 
•  Metabolism and nutrition disorders: This result was driven by higher incidence of decreased appetite 
(dulaglutide: 6.6%; placebo: 2.1%) and dehydration (dulaglutide: 1.3%; placebo: 0.8%), both of 
which are reflected in current labelling (Trulicity SmPC 2019). 
The TEAE profile of dulaglutide in the REWIND study was consistent with prior dulaglutide studies and the 
established safety profile of dulaglutide. No new adverse drug reactions were discovered.

Serious Adverse Events and Deaths 
A total of 4053 patients (40.9%) experienced at least 1 SAE (dulaglutide: 1997 [40.4%]; placebo: 
2056 [41.5%]). No treatment differences were observed in the overall proportion of patients who 
experienced at least 1 SAE. 
The proportion of deaths was similar between the two treatment groups. However, fewer deaths with CV 
causes occurred with patients treated with dulaglutide compared to placebo; deaths adjudicated as 
having CV causes in Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) are discussed in the efficacy section of this report. 
No  treatment-related  differences  were  observed  in  the  numbers  of  patients  with  causes  of  death 
adjudicated as non-CV (dulaglutide: 219 [4.4%]; placebo: 246 [5.0%]) or for which a cause could not be 
determined (dulaglutide: 59 [1.2%]; placebo: 66 [1.3%]). 
Deaths, Serious Adverse Events and Discontinuation from Study Drug, ITT Population 
Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class 
Patients most frequently reported SAEs in the SOCs of cardiac disorders (dulaglutide: 566 [11.4%]; 
placebo: 587 [11.9%]); infections and infestations (dulaglutide: 489 [9.9%]; placebo: 516 [10.4%]); 
neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) (dulaglutide: 334 [6.8%]; 
placebo: 338 [6.8%]); and injury, poisoning and procedural complications (dulaglutide: 264 [5.3%]; 
placebo: 261 [5.3%]). 
With the exception of the endocrine disorders SOC, no significant differences between the treatment 
groups were observed in any other SOC, including cardiac disorders, eye disorders, and hepatobiliary 
disorders. Although only a few patients in both treatment groups reported SAEs in the endocrine 
disorders SOC, the number of patients with SAEs in the dulaglutide group was significantly higher 
(p=0.042). However, there were no significant differences in any of the PTs under the endocrine disorders 
SOC.

Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class, ITT Population 
Serious Adverse Events by Preferred Term 
A summary of SAEs occurring with at least 1% incidence by Preferred Term (PT) in descending order is 
provided in the Table below. 
The most frequent SAEs overall were osteoarthritis, pneumonia and fall (with no significant differences 
between treatment groups and consistent with the elderly population enrolled in the REWIND study). 
Significantly smaller proportions of patients in the dulaglutide group experienced SAEs of cardiac failure 
and hyperglycemia (p<0.05), whereas significantly higher proportions of patients in the dulaglutide 
group experienced SAEs of atrial fibrillation (dulaglutide: 93 [1.9%]; placebo: 63 [1.3%]; p=0.015). 
There were 328 patients (6.6%) in the dulaglutide group and 308 patients (6.2%) in the placebo group 
who reported pre-existing atrial fibrillation at baseline. There were no significant differences between the 
treatment groups for the overall TEAEs of atrial fibrillation (dulaglutide: 259 [5.2%]; placebo: 233 
[4.7%]). Additional analyses conducted for SAEs of supraventricular arrhythmias and CV conduction 
disorders (summarized by PT based on the selected standardized MedDRA queries [SMQs] search criteria) 
did not show significant differences between the treatment groups.

Acute Pancreatitis Events 
Pancreatitis AEs have been reported with GLP-1 RAs; therefore, the risk of acute pancreatitis is included 
as a warning in the current labeling (Trulicity SmPC 2019; Trulicity USPI 2018). 
Following adjudication, a total of 41 events in 37 patients were confirmed as pancreatitis. Of these, 1 
patient in the dulaglutide group had 1 event adjudicated as chronic pancreatitis and 36 patients had acute 
pancreatitis (dulaglutide: 26 events in 23 patients [0.5%]; placebo: 14 events in 13 patients [0.3%]). 
The majority of acute pancreatitis cases were mild (dulaglutide: 21; placebo: 14). The numerical 
imbalance of acute pancreatitis was mainly driven by events of acute pancreatitis adjudicated based on 
symptoms and elevated pancreatic enzymes (dulaglutide: 15 events in 14 patients; placebo: 8 events in 
8 patients); these effects (GI symptoms and elevations in pancreatic enzymes) are known to occur with 
GLP-1 RAs. The numbers of acute pancreatitis events adjudicated based on the presence of all 3 criteria 
(symptoms, elevated enzymes, and imaging) were similar between treatment groups (dulaglutide: 5 
events in 5 patients; placebo: 4 events in 3 patients). 
Five of the dulaglutide-treated patients experienced acute pancreatitis events at least 4.5 months after 
study drug discontinuation (2 based on symptoms and elevated enzymes, 2 based on symptoms and 
imaging, and 1 based on all 3 criteria); therefore, these events were not likely related to dulaglutide. 
Overall, pancreatitis events reported in Study GBDJ are consistent with the known safety profile of 
dulaglutide and do not alter the conclusions drawn in the original marketing application or presented in 
current labeling (Trulicity SmPC 2019; Trulicity USPI 2018). 
Thyroid Neoplasms 
Thyroid C-cell tumours in rodents are considered a class effect of GLP-1 RAs, but the relevance in human 
subjects has not been established (Trulicity SmPC 2019). 
In Study GBDJ (REWIND), a total of 12 patients were adjudicated with thyroid neoplasms (dulaglutide: 10 
patients; placebo: 2 patients), which included: 
•  C-cell hyperplasia (dulaglutide: 1 patient), 
•  Carcinoma in-situ (microcarcinoma; dulaglutide: 3 patients; placebo: 1 patient), and 
• 
The results of Study GBDJ do not support a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA treatment and the 
Papillary thyroid cancer (dulaglutide: 6 patients; placebo: 1 patient). 
development of thyroid C-cell tumors. No thyroid events were adjudicated as medullary thyroid cancer. 
The data also do not support a causal relationship between dulaglutide and papillary thyroid carcinoma. 
Of the 6 dulaglutide-treated patients with adjudicated papillary thyroid cancer, 4 patients had medical 
histories that included hypothyroidism, goiter, thyroid nodules, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. One 
patient in the dulaglutide treatment group had adjudicated papillary thyroid cancer reported 40.3 months 
after permanently discontinuing from study drug. Two patients had adjudicated papillary thyroid cancer 
within 1 year of starting dulaglutide, suggesting the pathology was pre-existing. 
Increased calcitonin is a well-accepted measure of C-cell proliferation, particularly in medullary thyroid 
cancer, and was monitored at screening and then annually. Overall, serum calcitonin levels were not 
different between the treatment groups from baseline to last measurement, for treatment-emergent 
abnormal calcitonin values, or the proportion of patients with calcitonin values ≥20 ng/L.  
Severe Hypoglycemia 
Current labelling includes a warning indicating that hypoglycemia may occur when dulaglutide is used 
with insulin or an insulin secretagogue such as a sulfonylurea and that the dose of the concomitant 
medication may need to be lowered following the addition of dulaglutide (Trulicity SmPC 2019). 
In Study GBDJ, severe hypoglycemia events were prospectively collected on a specific electronic case 
report form (eCRF). Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with clinical symptoms consistent with 
hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person (that is, the patient could not treat himself or 
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019 
Page 27/49 
 
 
  
 
 
herself) to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or other resuscitative measures and one of the 
following: 
a) the event was associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or 
parenteral glucagon administration; or 
b) the event was associated with a fingerstick or laboratory plasma glucose level ≤54 mg/dL (≤3 
mmol/L). 
The overall incidence of severe hypoglycemia was small and no meaningful differences between the 
treatment groups were observed. The incidence rate (events/patient/year) was 0.0031 for dulaglutide 
and 0.0034 for placebo. The results of Study GBDJ show that there were no clinically meaningful study 
drug treatment-related differences in the incidence rates over time. 
Serious Allergic and Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Although uncommon, serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with dulaglutide as well as other 
GLP-1 RAs, as reported in the Trulicity labels (Trulicity SmPC 2019), and prescribers are directed to 
permanently discontinue use of dulaglutide in the event that one occurs. In Study GBDJ, the incidence of 
allergic and hypersensitivity reactions prospectively collected on the specific eCRFs was higher in the 
dulaglutide group compared with placebo. This difference is mainly due to the higher number of GI events 
that were reported under “other” as allergic and hypersensitivity reactions for the dulaglutide group. 
The incidence of the investigator-reported SAEs of immune-mediated reactions including serious allergic 
and hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, hypersensitivity, and severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions standardized MedDRA queries [SMQs], narrow terms) was lower in the 
dulaglutide group compared with placebo. 
SAEs of Supraventricular Arrhythmias and CV Conduction Disorders 
The SAEs of supraventricular arrhythmias and CV conduction disorders were analyzed based on selected 
SMQ search criteria. Overall, the number of patients with at least 1 SAE reflective of clinically significant 
supraventricular arrhythmias and CV conduction disorders was similar between the 2 treatment groups, 
and reflective of the population in Study GBDJ with a range of CV risk factors. 
Atrial fibrillation SAEs were reported by a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients in the 
dulaglutide group compared to the placebo group (dulaglutide: 93 [1.9%]; placebo: 63 [1.3%]; 
p=0.015). The proportions of patients who reported pre-existing atrial fibrillation at baseline were 
numerically higher for dulaglutide (328 patients [6.6%]) compared with placebo (308 patients [6.2%]). 
There were no significant differences between treatment groups for the overall TEAEs of atrial fibrillation 
(dulaglutide: 259 [5.2%]; placebo: 233 [4.7%]). In addition, qualitative assessment of ECGs did not 
show a difference in supraventricular arrhythmia. No other differences were observed between the 
treatment groups in the incidence of SAEs reflective of clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias 
and CV conduction disorders. 
Considering Study GBDJ enrolled a population with higher CV risks than previous dulaglutide studies, the 
overall profile with regards to clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias and CV conduction 
disorders is consistent with the known safety profile of dulaglutide and did not raise any new safety 
concerns in this regard. 
Serious GI Events 
The following selected PTs and SMQs related to serious GI AEs were of particular interest: PT appendicitis, 
PT appendicitis perforated, GI obstruction SMQ, gallstone related disorders SMQ, and gallbladder-related 
disorders SMQ (broad and narrow terms). The incidence of serious GI AEs was similar in both treatment 
groups. The serious GI event data reported in Study GBDJ do not alter the conclusions drawn in the 
original marketing application.

EMA/585102/2019 
Page 28/49 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Serious Hepatic Events 
The following SMQs related to serious hepatic AEs were of particular interest: drug-related hepatic 
disorders, liver-related investigations, signs and symptoms SMQ, cholestasis and jaundice of hepatic 
origin SMQ, liver-related coagulation and bleeding disturbances SMQ, drug-related hepatic disorders 
(severe events only) SMQ, hepatic failure, fibrosis, cirrhosis and other liver damage SMQ, hepatitis, and 
noninfections SMQ (broad/narrow terms). The incidence of serious hepatic AEs was comparable in both 
treatment groups. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in incidence of 
serious hepatic events for any PT. The serious hepatic event data reported in Study GBDJ do not 
alter the conclusions drawn in the original marketing application. 
Serious Renal Events 
SAEs of potential cases of acute renal failure were identified using the Acute Renal Failure SMQ (broad and 
narrow terms). No significant differences between treatment groups were observed in incidence of 
serious renal AEs potentially related to acute renal failure or in the progression to end-stage renal disease 
(defined as requirement for renal replacement therapy, or eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2) (dulaglutide: 110 
[2.2%]; placebo: 126 [2.5%]). In general, these renal events occurred in numerically fewer patients in 
the dulaglutide group compared with the placebo group. These results are consistent with the original 
marketing application and also with the subsequent dulaglutide clinical trial conducted in patients with 
chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4, and consistent with the microvascular endpoint. 
Serum creatinine, eGFR, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) were used to evaluate kidney 
function in Study GBDJ. Significant increases were seen in serum creatinine and significant decreases 
were seen in eGFR over time in both treatment groups. However, these changes were not considered 
clinically meaningful and were within the expected range for this T2D population; no overall clinically 
meaningful differences were observed between the treatment groups. Significant increases in UACR were 
observed in the placebo group and the UACR changes in the dulaglutide group were significantly smaller 
than the placebo group for all postrandomization time points. The proportions of patients with UACR 
values shifting to microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria were smaller in the dulaglutide group 
compared with placebo (microalbuminuria: 40.8% for dulaglutide, 44.3% for placebo; 
macroalbuminuria: 14.6% for dulaglutide, 18.2% for placebo). 
Cancer 
In Study GBDJ, the incidence of any neoplasm was summarized from malignant and nonmalignant 
neoplasms terms by high-level term, neoplasm type, and PT based on neoplasms SOC search criteria. The 
overall incidences of any neoplasm (excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer) or any cancer 
(excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer) were not different between the treatment groups. No 
differences between the treatment groups were observed in the incidence of pancreatic cancer. 
Statistically significant differences were observed for 4 cancer categories. The numbers of events and 
differences between groups were small: 
• 
• 
the incidences were lower in patients receiving dulaglutide compared with placebo for: 
o  basal or squamous and melanoma skin cancer (dulaglutide: 84 [1.7%]; placebo: 125 
[2.5%]; p=0.004), and 
o 
liver cancer (dulaglutide: 7 [0.1%]; placebo: 17 [0.3%]; p=0.041). 
the incidences were higher in patients receiving dulaglutide compared with placebo for: 
o  bone marrow cancer (dulaglutide: 26 [0.5%]; placebo: 11 [0.2%]; p=0.013), and 
o  blood cancer (dulaglutide: 25 [0.5%]; placebo: 8 [0.2%]; p=0.003). 
Ninteen patients had an event that was counted in both the blood cancer and bone marrow cancer 
types (dulaglutide: 14 patients; placebo: 5 patients); this was because some of the same PTs 
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019 
Page 29/49 
 
 
  
 
 
were included under both cancer types. 
There were no predominately reported terms, and none of the terms showed significant differences 
between the treatment groups. These observations could not be explained based on plausible biological 
mechanisms. The closest link between administration of a given treatment to the development of blood or 
bone marrow cancers is with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging chemotherapeutic agents for 
myeloid cancers (Bhatia 2013) or immunosuppressive agents in the context of lymphoid cancers (NCI 
2015). Dulaglutide, as a large biotherapeutic molecule would not be expected to interact directly with 
DNA (ICH 2011). Additionally, no evidence of leukemogenic potential was observed in nonclinical 
carcinogenicity studies with dulaglutide. Since marketing authorization was first granted (September 
2014), no related 
signals have been observed in routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug for Any Reason  
A total of 2730 patients (27.6%) permanently discontinued study drug prematurely with no overall 
significant difference between treatment groups. An additional 588 patients (5.9%) discontinued study 
drug due to death. Most reasons for permanent discontinuation of study drug did not differ between the 
2 treatment groups. However, fewer patients treated with dulaglutide discontinued from study drug due 
to “subject decision” compared with patients treated with placebo. More patients treated with 
dulaglutide discontinued from study drug due to AE than patients treated with placebo (dulaglutide: 451 
[9.1%]; placebo: 310 [6.3%]). This treatment-related difference in permanent discontinuations of study 
drug occurred early in treatment and was primarily driven by a higher incidence of GI AEs. 
Other Safety Results of Interest 
Cholelithiasis 
Development of cholelithiasis was defined as any new diagnosis of cholelithiasis after randomization, as 
evidenced on an imaging examination. Events of cholelithiasis reported during the study were 
prospectively collected on a specific eCRF. A total of 256 patients reported cholelithiasis in Study GBDJ 
(dulaglutide: 137 [3.2%]; placebo: 119 [2.8%]). The exposure-adjusted incidence rates (patients with 
events per 100 person-years) were 0.62 for dulaglutide and 0.56 for placebo. The results from Study 
GBDJ support the results from the original marketing application showing that patients treated with 
dulaglutide are not at an increased risk for cholelithiasis compared with patients treated with placebo. 
Overdose 
There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in the SAEs or TEAEs of overdose 
reported during the study (Summary of Clinical Safety, Section 2.7.4.2.1.6.3). A total of 20 patients had 
confirmed AE of dulaglutide overdose. Two were reported as serious (“other reason” or “medically 
significant”). The patients were not hospitalized for overdose, and the AEs or symptoms associated with 
the overdose events were nausea, fatigue, or loss of appetite. Both patients fully recovered from the 
overdose event. 
Diabetic Retinopathy 
Diabetic retinopathy requiring treatment with laser therapy, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy was a 
component of the composite microvascular efficacy endpoint. These events were reported by 
investigators but were not adjudicated. The hazard rate of the composite endpoint of diabetic retinopathy 
requiring treatment as well as the individual components (diabetic retinopathy requiring either laser 
therapy, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF) was not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups 
(hazard ratio [95%CI]: 1.24 [0.92, 1.68], p=0.156), but numerically more events occurred in the 
dulaglutide group (dulaglutide: 95 [1.9%] and placebo: 76 [1.5%]). Importantly, the composite endpoint 
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019 
Page 30/49 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
of diabetic retinopathy requiring treatment was limited to procedural endpoints and does not reflect 
objective assessment of changes in retinal pathology by sequential fundal examinations. Compared to the 
overall ITT population, patients who experienced the composite endpoint of diabetic retinopathy requiring 
treatment had longer duration of diabetes and slightly higher baseline HbA1c. 
Regardless of the treatment group, the incidence of the endpoint of diabetic retinopathy requiring 
treatment was notably higher in patients with baseline diabetic retinopathy. 
At baseline, for the overall ITT population, the number of patients reporting diabetic retinopathy was 
numerically larger in the dulaglutide group compared with the placebo group (dulaglutide: 576 [11.6%] 
versus placebo: 545 [11.0%]). The numerically larger number of patients who experienced the composite 
endpoint of diabetic retinopathy requiring treatment in the dulaglutide group is likely due to the 
numerically larger numbers of patients with baseline diabetic retinopathy in the dulaglutide group. This is 
further supported by the lack of differences in diabetic retinopathy TEAEs between the treatment groups 
(dulaglutide: 126 [2.6%]; placebo: 122 [2.5%]). 
Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms 
Current labeling includes increased heart rate and sinus tachycardia as adverse reactions associated with 
dulaglutide treatment (Trulicity SmPC 2019; Trulicity USPI 2018). In Study GBDJ, at Month 60, SBP was 
significantly decreased, although the change was small (-1.08 mmHg, dulaglutide vs. placebo), and heart 
rate was significantly increased in dulaglutide-treated patients compared with the placebo group. Again, 
the difference was small (1.37 bpm). The decrease in DBP was very small (0.26 mmHg) and not 
significantly different between treatment groups. The increases in heart rate with dulaglutide treatment 
were not associated with increased reporting of tachyarrhythmia AEs, as reported for the original 
submission. Dulaglutide treatment was not associated with increased reporting of other arrhythmias 
assessed by qualitative ECGs, either in terms of changes from baseline or in the incidence of qualitative 
rhythm or conduction results. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory measurements for the analysis of safety included calcitonin, serum creatinine, UACR, 
and fasting lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C, and triglycerides). 
Key results from clinical laboratory measures are presented below. All laboratory measures were 
analyzed by a local laboratory with the exception of calcitonin, which was analyzed by a central 
laboratory. 
Calcitonin 
•  No significant treatment differences were observed in mean serum calcitonin changes from baseline 
to last measurement, treatment-emergent abnormal calcitonin values, or the proportion of patients 
with elevated calcitonin values ≥20 ng/L (dulaglutide: 74 [1.6%]; placebo: 72 [1.5%]). 
Lipids 
• 
Larger decreases in total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, and 
triglycerides were observed in the dulaglutide group compared to the placebo group. However, these 
changes were small and of limited clinical relevance. 
Serum Creatinine, eGFR, and UACR 
Serum creatinine, eGFR, and UACR were used to evaluate kidney function in Study GBDJ (REWIND). 
•  Significant increases were seen in serum creatinine and significant decreases were seen in eGFR over 
time in both treatment groups. However, these changes were within the expected range for this older 
T2D population and no overall clinically meaningful differences were observed between the treatment 
groups. 
Safety in Special Populations 
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019 
Page 31/49 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Given that data available in the original dulaglutide submission was limited for patients >65 years of age 
and 22.2% of the GBDJ study population had eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the safety profile of dulaglutide 
was reviewed based on TEAEs and SAEs for placebo and dulaglutide for age subgroups (<65 years or ≥
65 years of age; <75 years or ≥75 years) and subgroups for baseline eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or ≥
60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Across the relevant subgroups of age and kidney function, the safety profile of 
dulaglutide was consistent; no clinically meaningful differences between the subgroups were observed for 
any TEAE or SAE. 
Post marketing experience 
The first marketing approval for dulaglutide occurred on 18 September 2014 when the US FDA approved 
dulaglutide as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D. 
Post-marketing data is continuously monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities by a 
cross-functional team. Based on evaluation of the postmarketing data, the previously established 
favourable benefit-risk balance for dulaglutide in the treatment of adult patients with T2D is confirmed. At 
this time, no additional pharmacovigilance or other risk minimization activities beyond those previously 
specified are proposed.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The data from Study GBDJ (REWIND) contributes a median follow-up of 5.4 years, which translates to 
51,830.1 person-years of follow-up safety data, to the dulaglutide clinical development program, 
providing a robust safety data set. The length of the study contrasts with the duration of the Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 studies included in the original marketing application (studies of up to 2 years of exposure). 
Study GBDJ (REWIND) provides safety data from 4949 dulaglutide-treated and 4952 placebo-treated 
patients with T2D who, compared to patients of the initial dulaglutide studies, were approximately 10 
years older (with 53.1% aged ≥65 years, and 9.7% aged ≥75 years), with more diabetes complications 
(22.2% with renal impairment as measured by baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, compared with 7.1% 
in the original application), and more CV risk factors. The safety profile from Study GBDJ (REWIND) 
reinforces the safety profile as described in the label for dulaglutide, and no new safety signals were 
identified. 
Overall, the safety profile for patients treated with dulaglutide in Study GBDJ (REWIND) was consistent 
with the safety profile reflected in current labelling, as established by the clinical trials for the original and 
subsequent marketing applications for dulaglutide, and postmarketing data. There were no relevant 
differences between dulaglutide and placebo in the overall number of patients reporting SAEs or TEAEs. 
Consistent with the GLP-1 RA class, GI events were the most common AEs in patients treated with 
dulaglutide. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment for any reason were similar between 
dulaglutide and placebo; however, the proportion of patients who permanently discontinued study 
treatment prematurely due to AEs was larger in the dulaglutide group (dulaglutide, 9.1% vs. placebo, 
6.3%). This difference appeared to occur early and was primarily driven by a higher incidence of GI AEs. 
The overall incidence of severe hypoglycemia was small, and no meaningful differences between the 
treatment groups were observed. Small differences in the incidence rates over time were likely related to 
adjustments in other antihyperglycemic concomitant medications during this double-blinded study.  
Adverse events of special interest that were adjudicated included pancreatitis and thyroid neoplasms, 
including medullary thyroid carcinoma and C-cell hyperplasia. 
The number of patients with adjudicated acute pancreatitis events was higher in the dulaglutide group 
compared with placebo. This numerical imbalance was mainly driven by a higher number of events in the 
dulaglutide group adjudicated based on symptoms and elevated pancreatic enzymes, which are expected 
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019 
Page 32/49 
 
 
  
 
 
to occur with GLP-1 RAs. In addition, the majority of the adjudicated acute pancreatitis events were mild, 
and in the dulaglutide treatment group approximately 22% of the events occurred at least 4.5 months 
after dulaglutide discontinuation. The numbers of acute pancreatitis events adjudicated based on the 
presence of all 3 criteria of symptoms, elevated enzymes, and imaging were very small in both treatment 
groups so that firm conclusions cannot be draw. Anyway, it is reassuring in respect to safety that the 
absolute number of pancreatitis events confirmed by imaging was small, even in the dulaglutide group. 
No thyroid events were adjudicated as medullary thyroid carcinoma, 1 event was adjudicated as C-cell 
hyperplasia in the dulaglutide group, and calcitonin levels were not different between the treatment 
groups. Papillary thyroid cancer accounted for the majority of thyroid neoplasms, and were primarily 
observed in patients with medical history of related thyroid events. It is assumed that C-cell hyperplasia 
or neoplasia is a rodent-specific effect, the mechanism of which is understood. Therefore, the single case 
observed with C-cell hyperplasia in the REWIND study can be considered a chance finding. 
No differences between the treatment groups were observed in the incidence of pancreatic cancer, 
serious GI AEs, serious renal events, serious hepatic AEs, or serious supraventricular arrhythmias or CV 
conduction disorders. Overall, the incidence of allergic and hypersensitivity reactions were similar and 
consistent with the previously observed safety profile for dulaglutide. No significant differences between 
treatment groups were observed in incidence of serious renal AEs potentially related to acute renal failure 
or in the progression to end-stage renal disease. In general, these renal events occurred in numerically 
fewer patients in the dulaglutide group compared to the placebo group. 
While the composite endpoint of diabetic retinopathy requiring treatment with laser therapy, vitrectomy, 
or anti-VEGF therapy was not significantly different between dulaglutide and placebo groups, a 
numerically larger number of events occurred in the dulaglutide group. The number of patients reporting 
diabetic retinopathy at baseline was also slightly larger in the dulaglutide group compared to the placebo 
group, and interventions for treatment of diabetic retinopathy during the study was primarily observed in 
patients with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy. However, it is questionable whether this small baseline 
imbalance can explain the numerically markedly higher imbalance between dulaglutide and plc in patients 
needing intervention for retinopathy. On the other hand, since the difference was not statistically 
significant, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Investigator-reported AEs under the eye disorder SOC in 
general or selected PTs for retinopathy AEs were not significantly different between dulaglutide and 
placebo. These results are consistent with data from a large clinical practice cohort study in 77,115 
patients (Douros et al. 2018) and an FDA AE reporting system analysis (Wang et al. 2019), both showing 
that use of GLP-1 RAs was not associated with increased risk of diabetic retinopathy overall. On the other 
hand, increase of diabetic retinopathy was observed in a recent CV outcome trial with another GLP1-RA, 
semaglutide. Further data are needed to decide whether GLP1-RAs could adversely affect the course of 
diabetic retinopathy. To date, no further actions appear warranted. 
Evaluation of adverse events suggested that dulaglutide could be associated with an increased risk for 
atrial fibrillation. There is no obvious underlying mechanism so that a chance finding cannot be excluded. 
The efficacy evaluation of the REWIND study has shown that the net effect of dulaglutide on CV endpoints 
is positive so that an increase in atrial fibrillation – if true – obviously does not outweigh other (beneficial) 
CV effects of dulagutide. 
In addition to comprehensive assessment of safety data, the MAH used standard operating procedures, 
including specific hierarchical statistical analyses in conjunction with medical review and judgement to 
identify adverse reactions informing the label. No new adverse reactions were identified and no changes 
have been proposed for adverse reactions in current labeling. Overall, the incidences of adverse reactions 
were similar in dulaglutide-treated patients in Study GBDJ compared to the cohort from the original 
marketing application. The study included a significant number of patients in elderly subpopulations (≥
65 years, ≥75 years) and patients with renal impairment (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The consistency of the 
Assessment report

safety profile of these subpopulations with the known safety profile of dulaglutide support the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety results of Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) including 9901 patients with a median follow-up of 
5.4 years reinforce the existing safety profile for dulaglutide. No new safety signals were identified, and 
no changes to the adverse reactions in the current product information are proposed. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this application, section 4.1 of the SmPC has been modified and sections 4.2, 4.4, 
4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 have all been updated based on the data obtained with the Study H9X-MC-GBDJ 
(REWIND). The Package Leaflet is being updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to implement editorial changes and to align the annexes with the latest QRD template. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable as the changes to the package leaflet are 
minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The estimated prevalence of CV disease in patients with T2DM ranges from 14.8% to 40.5% depending 
on age and region. CV disease is the most common cause of death in patients with T2DM, with at least 
50% of T2DM patients globally dying from CV disease. 
Trulicity (Dulaglutide) is currently licensed for the indication: 
Trulicity is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as: 
Monotherapy   
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom the use of 
metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications.  
Add-on therapy   
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019 
Page 40/49 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including insulin, when these, together 
with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see section 5.1 for data with respect 
to different combinations).  
With this application the MAH proposes to add the following new therapeutic indication: 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
Trulicity is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise: 
• as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications 
• in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes (see section 5.1). 
Trulicity is indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) 
• in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors without established 
cardiovascular disease 
• in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease (see section 5.1). 
The efficacy and safety data supporting the new indication are derived from the recently completed 
cardiovascular outcome trial [Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND)]. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
As cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with diabetes 
(Davies et al. 2018; ADA 2019b), therapeutic agents that not only promote glycemic control but also 
reduce CV risk in patients with T2D are needed. 
Recent cardiovascular outcome studies with the SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin in EMPA-REG, 
canagliflozin in CANVAS, dapagliflozin in DECLARE) and GLP-1 RA (liraglutide in LEADER, semaglutide in 
SUSTAIN-6) have shown a (modest) superior effect compared to placebo in the prevention of CV events 
while other antidiabetic agents e.g. DPP4-inhibitors (Sitagliptin in TECOS, Saxagliptin in SAVOR, 
Alogliptin in EXAMINE and Linagliptin in CAROLINA and CARMELINA) have reported a neutral, non-inferior 
effect on cardiovascular outcomes. 
The proportion of patients with established cardiovascular disease at baseline is lower in the REWIND 
study (31.5%) as compared to other CV outcome studies (established cardiovascular disease: 100% in 
ELIXA, 81.3% in LEADER, 58.8% in SUSTAIN-6 and 73.1% in EXSCEL). However, definitions of CVD 
differed between studies. For instance, in SUSTAIN-6 and LEADER patients with heart failure and chronic 
kidney disease stage 3 were included. Thus, it is not possible to conclude at present whether treatment 
effect on composite MACE is independent of cv disease status. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) was a well-designed double-blind cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) 
conducted in 9901 patients (randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dulaglutide 1.5 mg s.c. once weekly or placebo). 
The patients included in this study had a wide range of T2D disease severity with relatively good glycemic 
control at baseline and a majority did not have established CVD. The median follow-up time of this study 
was 5.4 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019 
Page 41/49 
 
 
  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The key benefit demonstrated in the REWIND study was the reduction of 3-component MACE compared 
to placebo (death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) in adult patients with T2D and either 
with or without established CVD. Dulaglutide significantly reduced the risk for 3-component MACE by 12% 
compared with placebo (hazard ratio [95.33% CI]: 0.88 [0.79, 0.99], p=0.026). The Kaplan-Meier curve 
showed that the incidence of the composite primary endpoint was consistently lower for the dulaglutide 
group over time compared to placebo. The curves appeared to separate early, with clear divergence by 6 
months from randomization, which was maintained through the end of the study. 
Consistent effects were demonstrated for each monocomponent of the primary endpoint (albeit formally 
statistical significance has not be shown for any of the monocomponents) and across the majority of 
subgroups. Of note, no treatment by subgroup interaction could be found for the subgroups defined by 
pre-existing prior cardiovascular disease (yes/no). The HR for all-cause mortality was 0.90 (0.80-1.01) 
which was in line with the result of the primary analysis. 
Dulaglutide also demonstrated a beneficial effect on the composite endpoint for microvascular outcomes. 
The point estimate for the composite microvascular endpoint was driven by the effect of dulaglutide on 
diabetic nephropathy. Fewer dulaglutide-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients 
reported worsening of diabetic nephropathy during the study (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.84 [0.77, 0.91]), 
primarily driven by a lower incidence of clinical proteinuria (UACR >300 mg/g). Although the effect cannot 
be considered statistically significant (nominal p-value), patients treated with dulaglutide appeared 16% 
less likely to experience worsening of diabetic nephropathy. 
Furthermore, known antihyperglycemic and antihypertensive effects of dulaglutide were confirmed in 
REWIND: the effects on HbA1c at month 60 (-0.51% [-0.57, -0.45], p<0.001) were significant but 
modest, which might be explained by the intended low baseline HbA1c (7.3%), a higher use of additional 
antidiabetic agents in the placebo group over the study duration and a considerable longer observational 
period. The effects of dulaglutide on blood pressure are consistent with previous dulaglutide studies and 
are reflected in the descriptions of the current labelling (Trulicity SmPC 2019). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Assessment of the individual components of the primary composite 3-point MACE were not statistically 
significant since the p-values were all greater than their final corresponding significance levels based on 
the hierarchical testing scheme. However, all of the three single MACE components (death from CV 
causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) favored dulaglutide (hazard ratios <1). 
A nominally significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed in the a-priori-defined regional 
subgroups, multiplicity adjustments were not made for the large number of pre-specified subgroups 
interactions tested (n=21). However, this limitation was alleviated by additional analyses of US or Europe 
versus the respective remainder of the study population as well as assessment of the primary endpoint by 
country support a consistency in treatment effect across international geographies. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile for dulaglutide is well characterized, as described in the original dulaglutide application 
and in current labeling; the most frequently reported TEAEs are GI-related events (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea). The data from Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) provide more extensive 
information on the dulaglutide safety profile, including CV safety in a population of patients who were at 
higher CV risk than patients in the original marketing application. Reflective of the original application, 
acute pancreatitis is considered a key risk of dulaglutide. In Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) the risk for 
Assessment report  
EMA/585102/2019 
Page 42/49 
 
 
  
acute pancreatitis was numerically increased with dulaglutide (dulaglutide: 26 events in 23 patients 
[0.5%]; placebo: 14 events in 13 patients [0.3%]). However, it is known that dulaglutide, like other 
GLP1-RAs, increases pancreatic enzymes in the blood by a mechanism unrelated to pancreatitis and 
causes GI side effects so that confirmation of pancreatitis without imaging is difficult in patients treated 
with dulaglutide. The number of patients with pancreatitis confirmed by imaging was very low so that this 
is not considered a concern. 
Increases in heart rate from baseline to Month 60 were significantly larger in the dulaglutide group 
compared to the placebo group [+1.37 beats/min (0.96, 1.78), p<0.001], however the effect size was 
smaller than the one observed in the studies submitted with the initial MAA. 
Overall, the safety results of Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) are consistent with the known safety profile 
for dulaglutide, and no new safety concerns were identified. No changes to safety labelling and no new 
pharmacovigilance or risk minimization activities are proposed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
While none are considered key risks for this benefit-risk assessment of dulaglutide, some AEs remain of 
particular interest for the GLP-1 RA class. In Study H9X-MC-GBDJ, thyroid cancer and diabetic 
retinopathy requiring treatment with laser therapy, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy were secondary 
safety and efficacy endpoints, respectively. Numerical differences were observed for papillary thyroid 
cancer and diabetic retinopathy requiring treatment; the treatment differences were small and not 
significant. 
No thyroid events were adjudicated as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), and 1 event was adjudicated 
as C-cell hyperplasia in the dulaglutide group. A total of 7 patients were adjudicated with papillary thyroid 
cancer (dulaglutide: 6; placebo: 1). The data from Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) do not support causal 
relationships between dulaglutide treatment and papillary thyroid cancers, C-cell hyperplasia or MTC. 
C-cell hyperplasia and neoplasia is a consistent finding in rodents, but the mechanism responsible for this 
species-specific effect is largely understood. To date there a no hints that GLP1-RAs affect C-cells in 
humans. Due to the rare occurrence of C-cell tumours in humans and the long latency period, a small 
effect cannot be excluded from existing clinical study data, but such a small effect would not be regarded 
as a relevant concern. 
Diabetic retinopathy requiring treatment with laser therapy, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy was a 
component of the composite microvascular efficacy endpoint. The events for this composite endpoint of 
diabetic retinopathy requiring treatment were limited to procedural endpoints; these were reported by 
investigators but were not adjudicated. In Study H9X-MC-GBDJ, the occurrences of diabetic retinopathy 
that required the procedures of laser therapy, vitrectomy, or anti-VEGF therapy were numerically larger 
for the dulaglutide group (95 [1.9%]) compared with the placebo group (76 [1.5%]).  Increased risk of 
diabetic retinopathy was also observed in the CV outcome trial of semaglutide (SUSTAIN-6) but was not 
observed in published database studies. Further information is needed to confirm or exclude an effect of 
GLP1-RAs on the progression of retinopathy. In case of dulaglutide, the effect – if true – was small so 
that it is not considered a concern.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND), the CVOT of dulaglutide in adults with T2D, demonstrated that 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg s. c. once weekly was superior to placebo as regards reduction of MACE (hazard ratio 
[95.33% CI]: 0.88 [0.79, 0.99], p=0.026). 
The safety profile for patients treated with dulaglutide in Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) was consistent 
with the safety profile reflected in current labelling, as established by the clinical trials for the original and 
subsequent marketing applications for dulaglutide, and postmarketing data. No new safety concerns were 
identified in Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND). 
Based on the results from Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND), which demonstrated CV benefit together with 
the consistent safety profile, the benefit-risk balance of once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg s.c. remains 
positive. However, the CHMP did not agree with the MAH’s proposed to include an additional indication in 
section 4.1 of the SmPC but the CHMP considered the strengthening of the wording of the indication in 
section 4.1 of the SmPC by deleting “improvement of glycaemic control” from section 4.1 of the SmPC 
(as this restriction does no longer adequately reflect the demonstrated effects for dulaglutide) together 
with the description of the benefits with dulaglutide regarding macrovascular and microvascular events, 
as assessed in this application, in section 5.1 of the SmPC (see discussion below).

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important effect is that superiority was shown for dulaglutide compared to placebo: the hazard 
ratio (0.88 [0.79, 0.99]); p=0.026) for the primary 3-component MACE (death from CV causes, nonfatal 
MI, or nonfatal stroke) was significantly lower for patients in the dulaglutide group compared to the 
placebo group. Several sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the consistency of 
effect on the primary endpoint in different study populations including the PP population and 
on-treatment population, or when adjusting for baseline factors or concomitant medications, also in 
different subgroups based on baseline characteristics. Results from all of these sensitivity and subgroup 
analyses were consistent with the primary analysis showing that superiority was achieved for dulaglutide 
compared to placebo.  
All of the three monocomponents contributed to the overall effect on the primary composite 3-component 
MACE since the estimated hazard ratios for all 3 monocomponents were <1. Furthermore, the incidence 
rate of nonfatal stroke was lower for the dulaglutide group compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio 
0.76, p=0.017), albeit statistical significance was not achieved for the time to first event analysis for 
nonfatal stroke when controlling for Type 1 error. 
Further important secondary endpoints, which showed favourable effects in line with the primary 
analysis,  included all-cause mortality, MI (fatal and nonfatal), stroke (fatal and nonfatal), hospitalization 
for heart failure, or hospitalization for unstable angina, albeit none of these secondary endpoints achieved 
statistical significance when controlled for Type I error. 
Safety findings for patients treated with dulaglutide in the REWIND study were consistent with previously 
reported safety data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 dulaglutide studies in patients with T2D and other GLP-1 
RAs; the most frequently reported TEAEs were GI-related events (e.g. nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).  
The most important unfavorable effects that were reported as adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
included pancreatitis and thyroid neoplams. The number of patients with adjudicated acute pancreatitis 
events was higher in the dulaglutide group (0.5%) compared to placebo (0.3%).  
No thyroid events were adjudicated as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), and 1 event was adjudicated 
as C-cell hyperplasia in the dulaglutide group. A total of 7 patients were adjudicated with papillary thyroid 
cancer (dulaglutide: 6; placebo: 1). The data from REWIND study do not support a causal relationship 
between dulaglutide treatment and papillary thyroid cancers, C-cell hyperplasia or MTC. Uncertainties 
remain for thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and MTC due to the long latency period and very rare occurrence. 
The overall incidence of severe hypoglycemia was small and no meaningful differences between the 
treatment groups were observed. Small differences in the incidence rates over time were likely related to 
adjustments in other antihyperglycemic concomitant medications during this double-blinded study. The 
incidence of allergic and hypersensitivity reactions prospectively collected on the specific eCRFs was 
higher in the dulaglutide group compared to placebo. This difference is mainly due to the higher number 
of GI events that were reported as allergic and hypersensitivity reactions for the dulaglutide group. The 
incidence of the investigator-reported immune-mediated reactions including serious allergic and 
hypersensitivity reactions was lower in the dulaglutide group compared to placebo. No significant 
differences between treatment groups were observed in incidence of serious renal AEs potentially related 
to acute renal failure or in the progression to ESRD. In general, these renal events occurred in numerically 
fewer patients in the dulaglutide group compared to the placebo group. No differences between the 
treatment groups were observed in the incidence of other AEs of interest including serious GI AEs, serious 
hepatic AEs, or serious supraventricular arrhythmias or CV conduction disorders.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND) was designed and powered as a superiority study to test the hypothesis 
that a once-weekly s.c. injection of dulaglutide 1.5 mg reduces the occurrence of the composite primary 
3-component MACE of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke when added to 
glucose-lowering regimen of patients with T2D, compared to the addition of a once-weekly placebo 
injection. 
The results showed that patients treated with dulaglutide had significantly lower risk for experiencing a 
3-component MACE (first occurrence of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke). The 
dulaglutide group has 12% lower risk for 3-component MACE and approximately 60 patients would need 
to be treated over a period of 5.4 years to prevent an event of death from CV causes, MI, or stroke. 
Based on Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND), which provided important information concerning the effect of 
dulaglutide on cardiovascular outcomes and its long term safety, the MAH proposed an extension of 
indication to include within section 4.1 of the SmPC: 
“Trulicity is indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) 
• in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors without established 
cardiovascular disease 
• in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease (see section 5.1).” 
With regard to the indication claimed by the MAH, the CHMP is of the view that the patient population 
eligible for treatment with dulaglutide should be mentioned, i.e. patients with T2DM, without mentioning 
any goal of treatment, i.e. neither improvement of glycaemic control, nor prevention of MACE. This means 
that the wording of the indication will refer to the patient population for whom treatment with dulaglutide 
is intended, i.e. patients with T2DM, and the information on the REWIND study, will be included in section 
5.1. The CHMP considers both improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality are an integral part of the treatment of T2DM, which could best be expressed in 
a single indication for the “treatment of T2DM”. Therefore, a separate cardiovascular prevention 
indication was not considered approvable. However, the CHMP considered the strengthening of the 
wording of the indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC by deleting “improvement of glycaemic control”
from section 4.1 of the SmPC (as this restriction does no longer adequately reflect the demonstrated 
effects for dulaglutide) together with the description of the benefits with dulaglutide regarding 
cardiovascular events, as assessed in this application, in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The wording “
treatment of T2DM” is considered more relevant as it encompasses both glycaemic control and results on 
clinical outcomes such as CV complications, with a reference to section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
With respect to the target population, the CHMP was of the view that the population studied in the 
REWIND trial (i.e. patients with T2DM and either with or without established CVD), is covered by the 
T2DM population already approved for Trulicity. Therefore CHMP considered it not justified to include a 
separate reference in section 4.1 of the SmPC as applied by the MAH. However the CHMP acknowledges 
the benefit in terms of cardiovascular outcome demonstrated in the REWIND study and is therefore of the 
view that the current wording of the indication which only makes reference to the treatment goal “
improvement of glycaemic control”does not fully reflect the demonstrated effects with dulaglutide. The 
wording “treatment of T2DM” was therefore considered more relevant in section 4.1 of the SmPC, as it 
Assessment report

encompasses both glycaemic control and results on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular 
complications, and a cross-reference to section 5.1 of the SmPC where the study results of the REWIND 
are reflected 
All patients that would benefit from the treatment with dulaglutide are covered by the indication as 
worded in the section 4.1 of the SmPC that resulted from this variation procedure. 
Thus, consistent with previous EMA decisions on CVOTs for other antidiabetic agents, the claimed new 
indication is not acceptable (since reduction of cardiovascular events is seen as a treatment goal of the 
underlying type 2 diabetes disease). But the indication wording in section 4.1 has been strengthened by 
removing the surrogate goal “to improve glycaemic control” to reflect the full demonstrated effect of 
dulaglutide together with a reflection of the results of the REWIND in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Following 
the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the MAH withdrew the initially claimed Extension of Indication and 
modified the wording of section 4.1 of the SmPC as requested by the CHMP. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The final wording for the modified indication in SmPC section 4.1 as agreed by the CHMP is as follows: 
“Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
Trulicity is indicated for the treatment of in adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes 
mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise improve glycaemic control as: 
• 
• 
As Mmonotherapy Wwhen diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in 
patients for whom the use of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications 
In addition to other Add-on therapy  In combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal 
products for the treatment of diabetes. including insulin, when these, together with diet and 
exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see section 5.1 for data with respect to 
different combinations). 
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and 
cardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.”  
Further, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have all been updated based on the data obtained 
with the Study H9X-MC-GBDJ (REWIND), and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes and to align the annexes with the 
latest QRD template. These amendments to the product information are all acceptable. 
An updated RMP version 3.4 was agreed during the procedure. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Trulicity (dulaglutide) in the treatment of T2DM remains positive.

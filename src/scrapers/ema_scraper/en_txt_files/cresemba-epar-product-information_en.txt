CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
CRESEMBA is indicated in adults for the treatment of
•
•
invasive aspergillosis
mucormycosis in patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate (see sections 4.4 and 5.1)
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antifungal agents.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Early targeted therapy (pre-emptive or diagnostic-driven therapy) may be instituted pending 
confirmation of the disease from specific diagnostic tests. However, once these results become 
available, antifungal therapy should be adjusted accordingly.
Loading dose
The recommended loading dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent to 200 mg of 
isavuconazole) every 8 hours for the first 48 hours (6 administrations in total).
Maintenance dose
The recommended maintenance dose is one vial after reconstitution and dilution (equivalent to 200 mg 
of isavuconazole) once daily, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose.
Duration of therapy should be determined by the clinical response (see section 5.1). 
For long-term treatment beyond 6 months, the benefit-risk balance should be carefully considered (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.3).
Switch to oral isavuconazole
CRESEMBA is also available as hard capsules containing 100 mg isavuconazole. 
On the basis of the high oral bioavailability (98%, see section 5.2), switching between intravenous and 
oral administration is appropriate when clinically indicated.
2
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients; however the clinical experience in elderly 
patients is limited.
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, including patients with end-stage 
renal disease (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Classes A and B) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Isavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Use in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the 
risks (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of CRESEMBA in children aged below 18 years has not yet been established. 
No data are available.
Method of administration
Intravenous use.
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product
CRESEMBA must be reconstituted and then further diluted to a concentration corresponding to 
approximately 0.8 mg/mL isavuconazole prior to administration by intravenous infusion over a 
minimum of 1 hour to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions. The infusion must be administered 
via an infusion set with an in-line filter with a microporous membrane made of polyethersulfone (PES) 
and with a pore size of 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm. CRESEMBA must only be given as an intravenous infusion.
For detailed instructions on the reconstitution and dilution of CRESEMBA before administration, see 
section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Co-administration with ketoconazole (see section 4.5).
Co-administration with high-dose ritonavir (>200 mg every 12 hours) (see section 4.5).
Co-administration with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, long-
acting barbiturates (e.g. phenobarbital), phenytoin and St. John’s wort or with moderate CYP3A4/5
inducers such as efavirenz, nafcillin and etravirine (see section 4.5).
Patients with familial short QT syndrome (see section 4.4).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity to isavuconazole may result in adverse reactions that include: anaphylactic reaction, 
hypotension, respiratory failure, dyspnoea, drug eruption, pruritus, and rash (see section 4.8). In case 
of anaphylactic reaction, isavuconazole should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical 
treatment should be initiated.
3
Caution should be used in prescribing isavuconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azole 
antifungal agents.
Infusion-related reactions
During intravenous administration of isavuconazole, infusion-related reactions including hypotension, 
dyspnoea, dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, and headache were reported (see section 4.8). The infusion 
should be stopped if these reactions occur. 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during 
treatment with azole antifungal agents. If a patient develops a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, 
CRESEMBA should be discontinued.
Cardiovascular
QT shortening
Isavuconazole is contraindicated in patients with familial short QT syndrome (see section 4.3).
In a QT study in healthy human subjects, isavuconazole shortened the QTc interval in a
concentration-related manner. For the 200 mg dosing regimen, the least squares mean (LSM) 
difference from placebo was 13.1 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 17.1, 9.1 ms]. Increasing the dose 
to 600 mg resulted in an LSM difference from placebo of 24.6 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 28.7, 
20.4 ms].
Caution is warranted when prescribing  isavuconazole to patients taking other medicinal products
known to decrease the QT interval, such as rufinamide.
Elevated liver transaminases or hepatitis
Elevated liver transaminases have been reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). The elevations in 
liver transaminases rarely required discontinuation of isavuconazole.  Monitoring of hepatic enzymes 
should be considered, as clinically indicated. Hepatitis has been reported with azole antifungal agents 
including isavuconazole.
Severe hepatic impairment
Isavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).
Use in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the 
risks. These patients should be carefully monitored for potential drug toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.8 
and 5.2).
Concomitant use with other medicinal products
CYP3A4/5 inhibitors
Ketoconazole is contraindicated (see section 4.3). For the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, 
a two-fold increase in isavuconazole exposure was observed. For other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, a 
less pronounced effect can be expected. No dose adjustment of isavuconazole is necessary when co-
administered with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, however caution is advised as adverse drug reactions
may increase (see section 4.5).
CYP3A4/5 inducers
Co-administration with mild CYP3A4/5 inducers such as aprepitant, prednisone, and pioglitazone, 
may result in mild to moderate decreases of isavuconazole plasma levels; co-administration with mild 
4
CYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the risk 
(see section 4.5).
CYP3A4/5 substrates including immunosuppressants
Isavuconazole can be considered a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, and systemic exposure to
medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4 may be increased when co-administered with 
isavuconazole.  Concomitant use of isavuconazole with CYP3A4 substrates such as the 
immunosuppressants tacrolimus, sirolimus or ciclosporin may increase the systemic exposure to these 
medicinal products. Appropriate therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary 
during co-administration (see section 4.5).
CYP2B6 substrates
Isavuconazole is an inducer of CYP2B6. Systemic exposure to medicinal products metabolised by 
CYP2B6 may be decreased when co-administered with isavuconazole. Therefore, caution is advised 
when CYP2B6 substrates, especially medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index such as 
cyclophosphamide, are co-administered with isavuconazole. The use of the CYP2B6 substrate 
efavirenz with isavuconazole is contraindicated because efavirenz is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4/5 
(see section 4.3). 
P-gp substrates
Isavuconazole may increase the exposure of medicinal products that are P-gp substrates. Dose 
adjustment of medicinal products that are P-gp substrates, especially medicinal products with a narrow 
therapeutic index such as digoxin, colchicine and dabigatran etexilate, may be needed when 
concomitantly administered with isavuconazole (see section 4.5).
Limitations of the clinical data
The clinical data for isavuconazole in the treatment of mucormycosis are limited to one prospective 
non-controlled clinical study in 37 patients with proven or probable mucormycosis who received 
isavuconazole for primary treatment, or because other antifungal treatments (predominantly 
amphotericin B) were inappropriate. 
For individual Mucorales species, the clinical efficacy data are very limited, often to one or two 
patients (see section 5.1).  Susceptibility data were available in only a small subset of cases. These 
data indicate that concentrations of isavuconazole required for inhibition in vitro are very variable 
between genera/species within the order of Mucorales, and generally higher than concentrations 
required to inhibit Aspergillus species. It should be noted that there was no dose-finding study in 
mucormycosis, and patients were administered the same dose of isavuconazole as was used for the 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential of medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole
Isavuconazole is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (see section 5.2). Co-administration of 
medicinal products which are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 may increase the plasma 
concentrations of isavuconazole. Co-administration of medicinal products which are inducers of 
CYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 may decrease the plasma concentrations of isavuconazole.
Medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4/5
Co-administration of isavuconazole with the strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor ketoconazole is 
contraindicated, since this medicinal product can significantly increase plasma concentrations of 
isavuconazole (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
For the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, a two-fold increase in isavuconazole exposure 
was observed. For other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as clarithromycin, indinavir and saquinavir, a 
5
less pronounced effect can be expected, based on their relative potency. No dose adjustment of 
isavuconazole is necessary when co-administered with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, however caution 
is advised as adverse drug reactions may increase (see section 4.4).
No dose adjustment is warranted for moderate to mild CYP3A4/5 inhibitors.
Medicinal products that induce CYP3A4/5
Co-administration of isavuconazole with potent CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, rifabutin,
carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital), phenytoin and St. John’s wort, or with 
moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers such as efavirenz, nafcillin and etravirine, is contraindicated, since 
these medicinal products can significantly decrease plasma concentrations of isavuconazole (see 
section 4.3).
Co-administration with mild CYP3A4/5 inducers such as aprepitant, prednisone and pioglitazone, may 
result in mild to moderate decreases of isavuconazole plasma levels; co-administration with mild 
CYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the risk 
(see section 4.4).
Co-administration with high-dose ritonavir (>200 mg twice daily) is contraindicated, as at high doses
ritonavir may induce CYP3A4/5 and decrease isavuconazole plasma concentrations (see section 4.3).
Potential for isavuconazole to affect exposures of other medicines
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4/5
Isavuconazole is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5; co-administration of isavuconazole with 
medicinal products which are substrates of CYP3A4/5 may result in increased plasma concentrations 
of these medicinal products. 
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6
Isavuconazole is a mild CYP2B6 inducer; co-administration of isavuconazole may result in decreased 
plasma concentrations of CYP2B6 substrates. 
Medicinal products transported by P-gp in the intestine
Isavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp); co-administration with isavuconazole may 
result in increased plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates.
Medicinal products transported by BCRP
Isavuconazole is an inhibitor in vitro of BCRP, and plasma concentrations of substrates of BCRP may 
therefore be increased. Caution is advised when isavuconazole is given concomitantly with substrates 
of BCRP.  
Medicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins
Isavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). Co-administration of 
isavuconazole with medicinal products which are substrates of OCT2 may result in increased plasma 
concentrations of these medicinal products.
6
Uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) substrates
Isavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of UGT. Co-administration of isavuconazole with medicinal products 
which are substrates of UGT may result in mildly increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal 
products.
Interaction table 
Interactions between isavuconazole and co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table 1 
(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”), ordered by therapeutic class. Unless otherwise stated, 
studies detailed in Table 1 have been performed with the recommended dose of isavuconazole.

Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown.
CRESEMBA must not be used during pregnancy except in patients with severe or potentially life-
threatening fungal infections, in whom isavuconazole may be used if the anticipated benefits outweigh 
the possible risks to the foetus.
Women of child-bearing potential 
CRESEMBA is not recommended for women of childbearing potential who are not using 
contraception.
Breast-feeding
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of 
isavuconazole/metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). 
A risk to newborns and infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with CRESEMBA.
Fertility
There are no data on the effect of isavuconazole on human fertility. Studies in animals did not show 
impairment of fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Isavuconazole has a moderate potential to influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients 
should avoid driving or operating machinery if symptoms of confusional state, somnolence, syncope,
and/or dizziness are experienced.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Delirium includes reactions of confusional state. 
Elevated liver chemistry tests includes events of alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate 
aminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood bilirubin increased, blood 
lactate dehydrogenase increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, hepatic enzyme increased, 
hepatic function abnormal, hyperbilirubinemia, liver function test abnormal, and transaminases 
increased.
Laboratory effects
In a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled clinical study of 516 patients with invasive fungal 
disease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi, elevated liver transaminases (alanine 
aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase) > 3 × Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) were reported at 
the end of study treatment in 4.4% of patients who received isavuconazole. Marked elevations of liver 
transaminases > 10 × ULN developed in 1.2% of patients on isavuconazole.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
Symptoms reported more frequently at supratherapeutic doses of isavuconazole (equivalent to 
isavuconazole 600 mg/day) evaluated in a QT study than in the therapeutic dose group (equivalent to 
isavuconazole 200 mg/day dose) included: headache, dizziness, paraesthesia, somnolence, disturbance 
in attention, dysgeusia, dry mouth, diarrhoea, oral hypoaesthesia, vomiting, hot flush, anxiety, 
restlessness, palpitations, tachycardia, photophobia and arthralgia.
Management of overdose
Isavuconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. There is no specific antidote for isavuconazole. In the 
event of an overdose, supportive treatment should be instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole- and tetrazole derivative, ATC 
code: J02AC05.
Mechanism of action
Isavuconazole is the active moiety formed after oral or intravenous administration of isavuconazonium 
sulfate (see section 5.2).
15
Isavuconazole demonstrates a fungicidal effect by blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, a key 
component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450-dependent 
enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. 
This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the 
cell membrane, thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. 
Microbiology
In animal models of disseminated and pulmonary aspergillosis, the pharmacodynamic (PD) index 
important in efficacy is exposure divided by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (AUC/MIC). 
No clear correlation between in vitro MIC and clinical response for the different species (Aspergillus
and Mucorales) could be established.
Concentrations of isavuconazole required to inhibit Aspergillus species and genera/species of the order 
Mucorales in vitro have been very variable. Generally, concentrations of isavuconazole required to 
inhibit Mucorales are higher than those required to inhibit the majority of Aspergillus species.
Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for the following Aspergillus species: Aspergillus fumigatus, 
A. flavus, A. niger, and A. terreus (see further below).
Mechanism(s) of resistance
Reduced susceptibility to triazole antifungal agents has been associated with mutations in the fungal 
cyp51A and cyp51B genes coding for the target protein lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase involved in 
ergosterol biosynthesis. Fungal strains with reduced in vitro susceptibility to isavuconazole have been 
reported, and cross-resistance with voriconazole and other triazole antifungal agents cannot be 
excluded.

Clinical efficacy and safety
Treatment of invasive aspergillosis
The safety and efficacy of isavuconazole for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis was 
evaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled clinical study in 516 patients with invasive fungal 
disease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population, 258 patients received isavuconazole and 258 patients received voriconazole. 
Isavuconazole was administered intravenously (equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole) every 8 hours for 
the first 48 hours, followed by once-daily intravenous or oral treatment (equivalent to 200 mg 
isavuconazole). The protocol-defined maximum treatment duration was 84 days. Median treatment 
duration was 45 days.
The overall response at end-of-treatment (EOT) in the myITT population (patients with proven and 
probable invasive aspergillosis based on cytology, histology, culture or galactomannan testing) was 
assessed by an independent blinded Data Review Committee. The myITT population comprised 123
16
patients receiving isavuconazole and 108 patients receiving voriconazole. The overall response in this 
population was n = 43 (35%) for isavuconazole and n = 42 (38.9%) for voriconazole. The adjusted 
treatment difference (voriconazole−isavuconazole) was 4.0% (95% confidence interval: −7.9; 15.9).
The all-cause mortality at Day 42 in this population was 18.7% for isavuconazole and 22.2% for 
voriconazole. The adjusted treatment difference (isavuconazole−voriconazole) was −2.7% (95 % 
confidence interval: −12.9; 7.5).
Treatment of mucormycosis
In an open-label non-controlled study, 37 patients with proven or probable mucormycosis received 
isavuconazole at the same dose regimen as that used to treat invasive aspergillosis. Median treatment 
duration was 84 days for the overall mucormycosis patient population, and 102 days for the 21 
patients not previously treated for mucormycosis. For patients with probable or proven mucormycosis 
as defined by the independent Data Review Committee (DRC), all-cause mortality at Day 84 was 
43.2% (16/37) for the overall patient population, 42.9% (9/21) for mucormycosis patients receiving 
isavuconazole as primary treatment, and 43.8% (7/16) for mucormycosis patients receiving 
isavuconazole who were refractory to, or intolerant of, prior antifungal therapy (mainly amphotericin 
B-based treatments). The DRC-assessed overall success rate at EOT was 11/35 (31.4%), with 5 
patients considered completely cured and 6 patients partially cured. A stable response was observed in 
an additional 10/35 patients (28.6%). In 9 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizopus spp., 4 patients 
showed a favourable response to isavuconazole. In 5 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizomucor
spp., no favourable responses were observed. The clinical experience in other species is very limited 
(Lichtheimia spp. n=2, Cunninghamella spp. n=1, Actinomucor elegans n=1).
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
CRESEMBA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of invasive 
aspergillosis and the treatment of mucormycosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Isavuconazonium sulfate is a water-soluble prodrug that can be administered as an intravenous 
infusion or orally as hard capsules. Following administration, isavuconazonium sulfate is rapidly 
hydrolysed by plasma esterases to the active moiety isavuconazole; plasma concentrations of the 
prodrug are very low, and detectable only for a short time after intravenous dosing.
Absorption
Following oral administration of CRESEMBA in healthy subjects, the active moiety isavuconazole is 
absorbed and reaches maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) approximately 2–3 hours after single 
and multiple dosing (see Table 3).

Effect of food on absorption
Oral administration of CRESEMBA equivalent to 400 mg isavuconazole with a high-fat meal reduced 
isavuconazole Cmax by 9% and increased AUC by 9%. CRESEMBA can be taken with or without 
food.
Distribution
Isavuconazole is extensively distributed, with a mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of 
approximately 450 L. Isavuconazole is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins, 
predominantly to albumin.
Biotransformation
In vitro / in vivo studies indicate that CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and subsequently uridine diphosphate-
glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), are involved in the metabolism of isavuconazole. 
Following single doses of [cyano-14C] isavuconazonium and [pyridinylmethyl-14C] isavuconazonium 
sulfate in humans, in addition to the active moiety (isavuconazole) and the inactive cleavage product, a 
number of minor metabolites were identified. Except for the active moiety isavuconazole, no 
individual metabolite was observed with an AUC > 10% of total radio-labelled material.
Elimination
Following oral administration of radio-labelled isavuconazonium sulfate to healthy subjects, a mean of 
46.1% of the radioactive dose was recovered in faeces, and 45.5% was recovered in urine. 
Renal excretion of intact isavuconazole was less than 1% of the dose administered.  
18
The inactive cleavage product is primarily eliminated by metabolism and subsequent renal excretion 
of the metabolites. 
Linearity/non-linearity
Studies in healthy subjects have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole are 
proportional up to 600 mg per day. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Paediatric patients
The pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients (< 18 years) have not yet been evaluated. No data are 
available.
Renal impairment
No clinically relevant changes were observed in the total Cmax and AUC of isavuconazole in subjects 
with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Of 
the 403 patients who received isavuconazole in the Phase 3 studies, 79 (20%) of patients had an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. No dose adjustment is 
required in patients with renal impairment, including those patients with end-stage renal disease. 
Isavuconazole is not readily dialysable (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment
After a single 100 mg dose of isavuconazole was administered to 32 patients with mild (Child-Pugh 
Class A) hepatic insufficiency and 32 patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic 
insufficiency (16 intravenous and 16 oral patients per Child-Pugh class), the least square mean 
systemic exposure (AUC) increased 64% in the Child-Pugh Class A group, and 84% in the Child-Pugh 
Class B group, relative to 32 age- and weight-matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Mean plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 2% lower in the Child-Pugh Class A group and 30% lower in 
the Child-Pugh Class B group. The population pharmacokinetic evaluation of isavuconazole in healthy 
subjects and patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunction demonstrated that the mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment populations had 40% and 48% lower isavuconazole clearance (CL) 
values, respectively, than the healthy population. 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
Isavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Use in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the 
risks (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
In rats and rabbits, isavuconazole at systemic exposures below the therapeutic level were associated 
with dose-related increases in the incidence of skeletal anomalies (rudimentary supernumerary ribs) in 
offspring. In rats, a dose-related increase in the incidence of zygomatic arch fusion was also noted in 
offspring (see section 4.6).
Administration of isavuconazonium sulfate to rats at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.0-fold 
the systemic exposure at the human clinical maintenance dose of 200 mg isavuconazole) during 
pregnancy through the weaning period showed an increased perinatal mortality of the pups. In utero
exposure to the active moiety isavuconazole had no effect on the fertility of the surviving pups.
Intravenous administration of 14C-labelled isavuconazonium sulfate to lactating rats resulted in the 
recovery of radiolabel in the milk. 
19
Isavuconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated with oral doses up to 
90 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.0-fold the systemic exposure at the human clinical maintenance dose 
of 200 mg isavuconazole).
Isavuconazole has no discernible mutagenic or genotoxic potential. Isavuconazole was negative in a 
bacterial reverse mutation assay, was weakly clastogenic at cytotoxic concentrations in the 
L5178Y tk+/- mouse lymphoma chromosome aberration assay, and showed no biologically relevant or 
statistically significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in an in vivo rat micronucleus test. 
Isavuconazole has demonstrated carcinogenic potential in 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies. Liver 
and thyroid tumours are likely caused by a rodent-specific mechanism that is not relevant for humans. 
Skin fibromas and fibrosarcomas were seen in male rats. The mechanism underlying this effect is 
unknown. Endometrial adenomas and carcinomas of the uterus were seen in female rats, which is 
likely due to a hormonal disturbance. There is no safety margin for these effects. The relevance for 
humans of the skin and uterine tumours cannot be excluded.
Isavuconazole inhibited the hERG potassium channel and the L-type calcium channel with an IC50 of 
5.82 µM and 6.57 µM respectively (34- and 38-fold the human non-protein bound Cmax at maximum 
recommended human dose [MRHD], respectively). The in vivo 39-week repeated-dose toxicology 
studies in monkeys did not show QTcF prolongation at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (approximately 
1.0-fold the systemic exposure at the human clinical maintenance dose of 200 mg isavuconazole). 
Environmental risk assessment has shown that CRESEMBA may pose a risk for the aquatic 
environment.

Special precautions for disposal and other handling
Reconstitution
One vial of the powder for concentrate for solution for infusion should be reconstituted by addition of
5 mL water for injections to the vial. The vial should be shaken to dissolve the powder completely. 
The reconstituted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration. 
Reconstituted concentrate should be clear and free of visible particulate. It must be further diluted 
prior to administration. 
Dilution and administration
After reconstitution, the entire content of the reconstituted concentrate should be removed from the 
vial and added to an infusion bag containing at least 250 mL of either sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose solution. The infusion solution contains 
approximately 0.8 mg isavuconazole per mL. After the reconstituted concentrate is further diluted, the 
diluted solution may show fine white-to-translucent particulates of isavuconazole, that do not sediment
(but will be removed by in-line filtration). The diluted solution should be mixed gently, or the bag 
should be rolled to minimise the formation of particulates. Unnecessary vibration or vigorous shaking 
of the solution should be avoided. The solution for infusion must be administered via an infusion set 
with an in-line filter (pore size 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm) made of polyether sulfone (PES). 
Isavuconazole should not be infused into the same line or cannula concomitantly with other 
intravenous products. 
Storage conditions after reconstitution and dilution are provided in section 6.3.
If possible, the intravenous administration of isavuconazole should be completed within 6 hours after 
reconstitution and dilution at room temperature. If this is not possible, the infusion solution should be 
immediately refrigerated after dilution, and infusion should be completed within 24 hours. Further 
information regarding the storage conditions after reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product
is provided in section 6.3.
An existing intravenous line should be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose solution.
This medicinal product is for single use only. Discard partially-used vials.
This medicinal product may pose a risk to the environment (see section 5.3).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
CRESEMBA is indicated in adults for the treatment of
•
•
invasive aspergillosis
mucormycosis in patients for whom amphotericin B is inappropriate (see sections 4.4 and 5.1)
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antifungal agents.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Early targeted therapy (pre-emptive or diagnostic-driven therapy) may be instituted pending 
confirmation of the disease from specific diagnostic tests. However, once these results become 
available, antifungal therapy should be adjusted accordingly.
Loading dose
The recommended loading dose is two capsules (equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole) every 8 hours 
for the first 48 hours (6 administrations in total).
Maintenance dose
The recommended maintenance dose is two capsules (equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole) once 
daily, starting 12 to 24 hours after the last loading dose.
Duration of therapy should be determined by the clinical response (see section 5.1).
For long-term treatment beyond 6 months, the benefit-risk balance should be carefully considered (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.3).
Switch to intravenous infusion
CRESEMBA is also available as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 200 mg 
isavuconazole.
On the basis of the high oral bioavailability (98%, see section 5.2), switching between intravenous and 
oral administration is appropriate when clinically indicated.
23
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients; however the clinical experience in elderly 
patients is limited.
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, including patients with end-stage 
renal disease (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Classes A and B) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Isavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Use in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the 
risks (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of CRESEMBA in children aged below 18 years has not yet been established. 
No data are available.
Method of administration
CRESEMBA capsules can be taken with or without food.
CRESEMBA capsules should be swallowed whole. Do not chew, crush, dissolve or open the capsules.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Co-administration with ketoconazole (see section 4.5).
Co-administration with high-dose ritonavir (>200 mg every 12 hours) (see section 4.5).
Co-administration with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, long-
acting barbiturates (e.g. phenobarbital), phenytoin and St. John’s wort or with moderate CYP3A4/5
inducers such as efavirenz, nafcillin and etravirine (see section 4.5).
Patients with familial short QT syndrome (see section 4.4).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity to isavuconazole may result in adverse reactions that include: anaphylactic reaction, 
hypotension, respiratory failure, dyspnoea, drug eruption, pruritus, and rash (see section 4.8). In case 
of anaphylactic reaction, isavuconazole should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical 
treatment should be initiated.
Caution should be used in prescribing isavuconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azole 
antifungal agents.
24
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during 
treatment with azole antifungal agents. If a patient develops a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, 
CRESEMBA should be discontinued.
Cardiovascular
QT shortening
Isavuconazole is contraindicated in patients with familial short QT syndrome (see section 4.3).
In a QT study in healthy human subjects, isavuconazole shortened the QTc interval in a
concentration-related manner. For the 200 mg dosing regimen, the least squares mean (LSM) 
difference from placebo was 13.1 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 17.1, 9.1 ms]. Increasing the dose 
to 600 mg resulted in an LSM difference from placebo of 24.6 ms at 2 hours post dose [90% CI: 28.7, 
20.4 ms].
Caution is warranted when prescribing isavuconazole to patients taking other medicinal products
known to decrease the QT interval, such as rufinamide.
Elevated liver transaminases or hepatitis
Elevated liver transaminases have been reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). The elevations in 
liver transaminases rarely required discontinuation of isavuconazole.  Monitoring of hepatic enzymes 
should be considered, as clinically indicated. Hepatitis has been reported with azole antifungal agents 
including isavuconazole.
Severe hepatic impairment
Isavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).
Use in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the 
risks. These patients should be carefully monitored for potential drug toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.8 
and 5.2).
Concomitant use with other medicinal products
CYP3A4/5 inhibitors
Ketoconazole is contraindicated (see section 4.3). For the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, 
a two-fold increase in isavuconazole exposure was observed. For other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, a 
less pronounced effect can be expected. No dose adjustment of isavuconazole is necessary when co-
administered with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, however caution is advised as adverse drug reactions
may increase (see section 4.5).
CYP3A4/5 inducers
Co-administration with mild CYP3A4/5 inducers such as aprepitant, prednisone, and pioglitazone, 
may result in mild to moderate decreases of isavuconazole plasma levels; co-administration with mild 
CYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the risk 
(see section 4.5).
CYP3A4/5 substrates including immunosuppressants
Isavuconazole can be considered a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, and systemic exposure to
medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4 may be increased when co-administered with 
isavuconazole.  Concomitant use of isavuconazole with CYP3A4 substrates such as the 
immunosuppressants tacrolimus, sirolimus or ciclosporin may increase the systemic exposure to these 
medicinal products. Appropriate therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary 
during co-administration (see section 4.5).
25
CYP2B6 substrates
Isavuconazole is an inducer of CYP2B6. Systemic exposure to medicinal products metabolised by 
CYP2B6 may be decreased when co-administered with isavuconazole. Therefore, caution is advised 
when CYP2B6 substrates, especially medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index such as 
cyclophosphamide, are co-administered with isavuconazole. The use of the CYP2B6 substrate 
efavirenz with isavuconazole is contraindicated because efavirenz is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4/5
(see section 4.3). 
P-gp substrates
Isavuconazole may increase the exposure of medicinal products that are P-gp substrates. Dose 
adjustment of medicinal products that are P-gp substrates, especially medicinal products with a narrow 
therapeutic index such as digoxin, colchicine and dabigatran etexilate, may be needed when 
concomitantly administered with isavuconazole (see section 4.5).
Limitations of the clinical data
The clinical data for isavuconazole in the treatment of mucormycosis are limited to one prospective 
non-controlled clinical study in 37 patients with proven or probable mucormycosis who received 
isavuconazole for primary treatment, or because other antifungal treatments (predominantly 
amphotericin B) were inappropriate. 
For individual Mucorales species, the clinical efficacy data are very limited, often to one or two 
patients (see section 5.1).  Susceptibility data were available in only a small subset of cases. These 
data indicate that concentrations of isavuconazole required for inhibition in vitro are very variable 
between genera/species within the order of Mucorales, and generally higher than concentrations 
required to inhibit Aspergillus species. It should be noted that there was no dose-finding study in 
mucormycosis, and patients were administered the same dose of isavuconazole as was used for the 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential of medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole
Isavuconazole is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (see section 5.2). Co-administration of 
medicinal products which are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 may increase the plasma 
concentrations of isavuconazole. Co-administration of medicinal products which are inducers of 
CYP3A4 and/or CYP3A5 may decrease the plasma concentrations of isavuconazole.
Medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4/5
Co-administration of isavuconazole with the strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor ketoconazole is 
contraindicated, since this medicinal product can significantly increase plasma concentrations of 
isavuconazole (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
For the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, a two-fold increase in isavuconazole exposure 
was observed. For other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as clarithromycin, indinavir and saquinavir, a 
less pronounced effect can be expected, based on their relative potency. No dose adjustment of 
isavuconazole is necessary when co-administered with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, however caution 
is advised as adverse drug reactions may increase (see section 4.4).
No dose adjustment is warranted for moderate to mild CYP3A4/5 inhibitors.
Medicinal products that induce CYP3A4/5
Co-administration of isavuconazole with potent CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, rifabutin,
carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital), phenytoin and St. John’s wort, or with 
moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers such as efavirenz, nafcillin and etravirine, is contraindicated, since 
26
these medicinal products can significantly decrease plasma concentrations of isavuconazole (see 
section 4.3).
Co-administration with mild CYP3A4/5 inducers such as aprepitant, prednisone and pioglitazone, may 
result in mild to moderate decreases of isavuconazole plasma levels; co-administration with mild 
CYP3A4/5 inducers should be avoided unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the risk 
(see section 4.4).
Co-administration with high-dose ritonavir (>200 mg twice daily) is contraindicated, as at high doses
ritonavir may induce CYP3A4/5 and decrease isavuconazole plasma concentrations (see section 4.3).
Potential for isavuconazole to affect exposures of other medicines
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4/5
Isavuconazole is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5; co-administration of isavuconazole with 
medicinal products which are substrates of CYP3A4/5 may result in increased plasma concentrations 
of these medicinal products. 
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6
Isavuconazole is a mild CYP2B6 inducer; co-administration of isavuconazole may result in decreased 
plasma concentrations of CYP2B6 substrates. 
Medicinal products transported by P-gp in the intestine
Isavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp); co-administration with isavuconazole may 
result in increased plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates.
Medicinal products transported by BCRP
Isavuconazole is an inhibitor in vitro of BCRP, and plasma concentrations of substrates of BCRP may 
therefore be increased. Caution is advised when isavuconazole is given concomitantly with substrates 
of BCRP.  
Medicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins
Isavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). Co-administration of 
isavuconazole with medicinal products which are substrates of OCT2 may result in increased plasma 
concentrations of these medicinal products.
Uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) substrates
Isavuconazole is a mild inhibitor of UGT. Co-administration of isavuconazole with medicinal products 
which are substrates of UGT may result in mildly increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal 
products.
Interaction table 
Interactions between isavuconazole and co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table 1 
(increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”), ordered by therapeutic class. Unless otherwise stated, 
studies detailed in Table 1 have been performed with the recommended dose of isavuconazole.

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of CRESEMBA in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown.
CRESEMBA must not be used during pregnancy except in patients with severe or potentially life-
threatening fungal infections, in whom isavuconazole may be used if the anticipated benefits outweigh 
the possible risks to the foetus.
Women of child-bearing potential 
CRESEMBA is not recommended for women of childbearing potential who are not using 
contraception.
Breast-feeding
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of 
isavuconazole/metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). 
A risk to newborns and infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with CRESEMBA.
Fertility
There are no data on the effect of isavuconazole on human fertility. Studies in animals did not show 
impairment of fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3).

4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Isavuconazole has a moderate potential to influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients 
should avoid driving or operating machinery if symptoms of confusional state, somnolence, syncope,
and/or dizziness are experienced. 
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most common treatment-related adverse reactions were elevated liver chemistry tests (7.9%), 
nausea (7.4%), vomiting (5.5%), dyspnoea (3.2%), abdominal pain (2.7%), diarrhoea (2.7%), injection 
site reaction (2.2%), headache (2.0%), hypokalaemia (1.7%) and rash (1.7%). 
The adverse reactions which most often led to permanent discontinuation of isavuconazole treatment 
were confusional state (0.7%), acute renal failure (0.7%), increased blood bilirubin (0.5%), convulsion 
(0.5%), dyspnoea (0.5%), epilepsy (0.5%), respiratory failure (0.5%) and vomiting (0.5%).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Delirium includes reactions of confusional state. 
Elevated liver chemistry tests includes events of alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate 
aminotransferase increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood bilirubin increased, blood 
lactate dehydrogenase increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, hepatic enzyme increased, 
hepatic function abnormal, hyperbilirubinemia, liver function test abnormal, and transaminases 
increased.
Laboratory effects
In a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled clinical study of 516 patients with invasive fungal 
disease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi, elevated liver transaminases (alanine 
aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase) > 3 × Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) were reported at 
the end of study treatment in 4.4% of patients who received isavuconazole. Marked elevations of liver 
transaminases > 10 × ULN developed in 1.2% of patients on isavuconazole.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, triazole- and tetrazole derivative, ATC 
code: J02AC05.
Mechanism of action
Isavuconazole is the active moiety formed after oral or intravenous administration of isavuconazonium 
sulfate (see section 5.2).
Isavuconazole demonstrates a fungicidal effect by blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, a key 
component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450-dependent 
enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. 
This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the 
cell membrane, thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. 
Microbiology
In animal models of disseminated and pulmonary aspergillosis, the pharmacodynamic (PD) index 
important in efficacy is exposure divided by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (AUC/MIC). 
No clear correlation between in vitro MIC and clinical response for the different species (Aspergillus
and Mucorales) could be established.
Concentrations of isavuconazole required to inhibit Aspergillus species and genera/species of the order 
Mucorales in vitro have been very variable. Generally, concentrations of isavuconazole required to 
inhibit Mucorales are higher than those required to inhibit the majority of Aspergillus species.
Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for the following Aspergillus species: Aspergillus fumigatus, 
A. flavus, A. niger, and A. terreus (see further below).
Mechanism(s) of resistance
Reduced susceptibility to triazole antifungal agents has been associated with mutations in the fungal 
cyp51A and cyp51B genes coding for the target protein lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase involved in 
ergosterol biosynthesis. Fungal strains with reduced in vitro susceptibility to isavuconazole have been 
reported, and cross-resistance with voriconazole and other triazole antifungal agents cannot be 
excluded.

Clinical efficacy and safety
Treatment of invasive aspergillosis
The safety and efficacy of isavuconazole for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis was 
evaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled clinical study in 516 patients with invasive fungal 
disease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population, 258 patients received isavuconazole and 258 patients received voriconazole. 
Isavuconazole was administered intravenously (equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole) every 8 hours for 
the first 48 hours, followed by once-daily intravenous or oral treatment (equivalent to 200 mg 
isavuconazole). The protocol-defined maximum treatment duration was 84 days. Median treatment 
duration was 45 days.
The overall response at end-of-treatment (EOT) in the myITT population (patients with proven and 
probable invasive aspergillosis based on cytology, histology, culture or galactomannan testing) was 
assessed by an independent blinded Data Review Committee. The myITT population comprised 123
patients receiving isavuconazole and 108 patients receiving voriconazole. The overall response in this 
population was n = 43 (35%) for isavuconazole and n = 42 (38.9%) for voriconazole. The adjusted 
treatment difference (voriconazole−isavuconazole) was 4.0% (95% confidence interval: −7.9; 15.9).
The all-cause mortality at Day 42 in this population was 18.7% for isavuconazole and 22.2% for 
voriconazole. The adjusted treatment difference (isavuconazole−voriconazole) was −2.7% (95 % 
confidence interval: −12.9; 7.5).
Treatment of mucormycosis
In an open-label non-controlled study, 37 patients with proven or probable mucormycosis received 
isavuconazole at the same dose regimen as that used to treat invasive aspergillosis. Median treatment 
duration was 84 days for the overall mucormycosis patient population, and 102 days for the 21 
patients not previously treated for mucormycosis. For patients with probable or proven mucormycosis 
as defined by the independent Data Review Committee (DRC), all-cause mortality at Day 84 was 
43.2% (16/37) for the overall patient population, 42.9% (9/21) for mucormycosis patients receiving 
isavuconazole as primary treatment, and 43.8% (7/16) for mucormycosis patients receiving 
isavuconazole who were refractory to, or intolerant of, prior antifungal therapy (mainly amphotericin 
B-based treatments). The DRC-assessed overall success rate at EOT was 11/35 (31.4%), with 5 
patients considered completely cured and 6 patients partially cured. A stable response was observed in 
an additional 10/35 patients (28.6%). In 9 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizopus spp., 4 patients 
showed a favourable response to isavuconazole. In 5 patients with mucormycosis due to Rhizomucor
spp., no favourable responses were observed. The clinical experience in other species is very limited 
(Lichtheimia spp. n=2, Cunninghamella spp. n=1, Actinomucor elegans n=1).
37
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
CRESEMBA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of invasive 
aspergillosis and the treatment of mucormycosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Isavuconazonium sulfate is a water-soluble prodrug that can be administered as an intravenous 
infusion or orally as hard capsules. Following administration, isavuconazonium sulfate is rapidly 
hydrolysed by plasma esterases to the active moiety isavuconazole; plasma concentrations of the 
prodrug are very low, and detectable only for a short time after intravenous dosing.
Absorption
Following oral administration of CRESEMBA in healthy subjects, the active moiety isavuconazole is 
absorbed and reaches maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) approximately 2–3 hours after single 
and multiple dosing (see Table 3).

Effect of food on absorption
Oral administration of CRESEMBA equivalent to 400 mg isavuconazole with a high-fat meal reduced 
isavuconazole Cmax by 9% and increased AUC by 9%. CRESEMBA can be taken with or without 
food.
Distribution
Isavuconazole is extensively distributed, with a mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of 
approximately 450 L. Isavuconazole is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins, 
predominantly to albumin.
38
Biotransformation
In vitro / in vivo studies indicate that CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and subsequently uridine diphosphate-
glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), are involved in the metabolism of isavuconazole. 
Following single doses of [cyano-14C] isavuconazonium and [pyridinylmethyl-14C] isavuconazonium 
sulfate in humans, in addition to the active moiety (isavuconazole) and the inactive cleavage product, a 
number of minor metabolites were identified. Except for the active moiety isavuconazole, no 
individual metabolite was observed with an AUC > 10% of total radio-labelled material.
Elimination
Following oral administration of radio-labelled isavuconazonium sulfate to healthy subjects, a mean of 
46.1% of the radioactive dose was recovered in faeces, and 45.5% was recovered in urine. 
Renal excretion of intact isavuconazole was less than 1% of the dose administered.  
The inactive cleavage product is primarily eliminated by metabolism and subsequent renal excretion 
of the metabolites. 
Linearity/non-linearity
Studies in healthy subjects have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole are 
proportional up to 600 mg per day. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Paediatric patients
The pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients (< 18 years) have not yet been evaluated. No data are 
available.
Renal impairment
No clinically relevant changes were observed in the total Cmax and AUC of isavuconazole in subjects 
with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Of 
the 403 patients who received isavuconazole in the Phase 3 studies, 79 (20%) of patients had an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. No dose adjustment is 
required in patients with renal impairment, including those patients with end-stage renal disease. 
Isavuconazole is not readily dialysable (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment
After a single 100 mg dose of isavuconazole was administered to 32 patients with mild (Child-Pugh 
Class A) hepatic insufficiency and 32 patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic 
insufficiency (16 intravenous and 16 oral patients per Child-Pugh class), the least square mean 
systemic exposure (AUC) increased 64% in the Child-Pugh Class A group, and 84% in the Child-Pugh 
Class B group, relative to 32 age- and weight-matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Mean plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 2% lower in the Child-Pugh Class A group and 30% lower in 
the Child-Pugh Class B group. The population pharmacokinetic evaluation of isavuconazole in healthy 
subjects and patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunction demonstrated that the mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment populations had 40% and 48% lower isavuconazole clearance (CL) 
values, respectively, than the healthy population. 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
39
Isavuconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
Use in these patients is not recommended unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the 
risks (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
In rats and rabbits, isavuconazole at systemic exposures below the therapeutic level were associated 
with dose-related increases in the incidence of skeletal anomalies (rudimentary supernumerary ribs) in 
offspring. In rats, a dose-related increase in the incidence of zygomatic arch fusion was also noted in 
offspring (see section 4.6).
Administration of isavuconazonium sulfate to rats at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.0-fold 
the systemic exposure at the human clinical maintenance dose of 200 mg isavuconazole) during 
pregnancy through the weaning period showed an increased perinatal mortality of the pups. In utero
exposure to the active moiety isavuconazole had no effect on the fertility of the surviving pups.
Intravenous administration of 14C-labelled isavuconazonium sulfate to lactating rats resulted in the 
recovery of radiolabel in the milk. 
Isavuconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated with oral doses up to 
90 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.0-fold the systemic exposure at the human clinical maintenance dose 
of 200 mg isavuconazole).
Isavuconazole has no discernible mutagenic or genotoxic potential. Isavuconazole was negative in a 
bacterial reverse mutation assay, was weakly clastogenic at cytotoxic concentrations in the 
L5178Y tk+/- mouse lymphoma chromosome aberration assay, and showed no biologically relevant or 
statistically significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in an in vivo rat micronucleus test. 
Isavuconazole has demonstrated carcinogenic potential in 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies. Liver 
and thyroid tumours are likely caused by a rodent-specific mechanism that is not relevant for humans. 
Skin fibromas and fibrosarcomas were seen in male rats. The mechanism underlying this effect is 
unknown. Endometrial adenomas and carcinomas of the uterus were seen in female rats, which is 
likely due to a hormonal disturbance. There is no safety margin for these effects. The relevance for 
humans of the skin and uterine tumours cannot be excluded.
Isavuconazole inhibited the hERG potassium channel and the L-type calcium channel with an IC50 of 
5.82 µM and 6.57 µM respectively (34- and 38-fold the human non-protein bound Cmax at maximum 
recommended human dose [MRHD], respectively). The in vivo 39-week repeated-dose toxicology 
studies in monkeys did not show QTcF prolongation at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (approximately 
1.0-fold the systemic exposure at the human clinical maintenance dose of 200 mg isavuconazole). 
Environmental  risk  assessment  has  shown  that  CRESEMBA  may  pose  a  risk  for  the  aquatic 
environment.

Isavuconazole works by killing or stopping the growth of the fungus, which causes the infection. 
What Cresemba is used for
Cresemba is used in adults to treat the following fungal infections:
-
-
invasive aspergillosis, caused by a fungus in the ‘Aspergillus’ group; 
mucormycosis, caused by a fungus belonging to the ‘Mucorales’ group in patients for whom a 
treatment with amphotericin B is not appropriate.
2. What you need to know before you use Cresemba
Do not use Cresemba:
-
if you are allergic to isavuconazole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6),
if you have a heart beat problem called ‘familial short QT syndrome’,
if you are using any of the following medicines:
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
ketoconazole, used for fungal infections,
high doses of ritonavir (more than 200 mg every 12 hours), used for HIV,

if you have had an allergic reaction to other ‘azole’ anti-fungal treatments in the past, such as 
ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole or posaconazole,
if you are suffering from severe liver disease. Your doctor should monitor you for possible side 
effects.
-
Look out for side effects
Stop using Cresemba and tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following 
side effects:
-
sudden wheezing, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, mouth or tongue, severe 
itching, sweating, dizziness or fainting, fast heartbeat or pounding in the chest – these 
may be signs of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).
Problems while having Cresemba as drip into a vein
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following side effects:
-
low blood pressure, feel short of breath, nausea, dizziness, headache, tingling – your doctor 
may decide to stop the infusion.
Changes in your liver function
Cresemba can sometimes affect your liver function. Your doctor may carry out blood tests while 
you are taking this medicine. 
Skin problems
Tell your doctor straight away if you get severe blistering of the skin, mouth, eyes or genitals.
Children and adolescents
Cresemba should not be used in children or adolescents younger than 18 years because there is no 
information on use in this age group.
Other medicines and Cresemba

not known if it may affect or harm your unborn baby. 
Do not breast-feed if you are taking Cresemba. 
Driving and using machines
Cresemba may make you feel confused, tired or sleepy. It can also make you pass out. Therefore, be 
very careful when driving or operating machines.
3.
How to use Cresemba
Cresemba will be given to you by a doctor or nurse.
Starting dose for the first two days (48 hours)
The recommended dose is one vial every 8 hours.
Usual dose after the first two days
This is started 12 to 24 hours after your last starting dose. The recommended dose is one vial once a 
day.
You will be given this dose until your doctor tells you otherwise. The duration of treatment with 
Cresemba may be longer than 6 months if your doctor considers this necessary.
The vial will be given as a drip into a vein by your doctor or nurse.
If you use more Cresemba than you should
If you think you have been given too much Cresemba, talk to your doctor or nurse straight away. You 
may have more side effects such as: 
-
-
-
-
-
headache, feeling dizzy, restless or sleepy,
tingling, reduced sense of touch or sensation in the mouth,
problems being aware of things, hot flushes, anxiety, joint pain,
changes in the way things taste, dry mouth, diarrhoea, vomiting,
feeling your heart beat, faster heart rate, being more sensitive to light.
56
If you forget to use Cresemba
As you will be given this medicine under close medical supervision, it is unlikely that a dose would be

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Cresemba 200 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion must be reconstituted and diluted 
prior to infusion.
Reconstitution
One vial of the powder for concentrate for solution for infusion should be reconstituted by addition of 
5 mL water for injection to the vial. The vial should be shaken to dissolve the powder completely. The 
reconstituted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration. 
Reconstituted concentrate should be clear and free of visible particulate. It must be further diluted 
prior to administration. 
Dilution and administration
After reconstitution, the entire content of the reconstituted concentrate should be removed from the 
vial and added to an infusion bag containing at least 250 mL of either sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose solution. The infusion solution contains 
approximately 0.8 mg isavuconazole per mL. After the reconstituted concentrate is further diluted, the 
diluted solution may show fine white-to-translucent particulates of isavuconazole that do not sediment
(but will be removed by in-line filtration). The diluted solution should be mixed gently, or the bag 
should be rolled to minimise the formation of particulates. Unnecessary vibration or vigorous shaking 
of the solution should be avoided. The solution for infusion must be administered via an infusion set 
with an in-line filter (pore size 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm) made of polyether sulfone (PES). 
Isavuconazole should not be infused into the same line or cannula concomitantly with other 
intravenous products. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability after reconstitution and dilution has been demonstrated for 24 
hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, or 6 hours at room temperature.
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
60
would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C, unless reconstitution and dilution has 
taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
If possible, the intravenous administration of isavuconazole should be completed within 6 hours after 
reconstitution and dilution at room temperature. If this is not possible, the infusion solution should be 
immediately refrigerated after dilution, and infusion should be completed within 24 hours. 
An existing intravenous line should be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) dextrose solution.
This medicinal product is for single use only. Discard partially-used vials.

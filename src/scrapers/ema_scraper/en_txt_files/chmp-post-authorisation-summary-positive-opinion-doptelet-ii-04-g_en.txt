(publ). 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows2: 
Doptelet is indicated for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic 
liver disease who are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure.

(ITP) in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins). 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR),

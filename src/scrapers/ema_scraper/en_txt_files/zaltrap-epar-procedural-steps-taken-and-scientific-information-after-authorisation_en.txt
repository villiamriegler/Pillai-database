SmPC,  Annex 
Proteinuria occurring during aflibercept treatment should be 
the existing warnings on proteinuria in line with a 
II  and PL 
monitored by urine dipstick analysis and/or urinary protein 
proposed amendment to the CCDS.  Moreover, a 
minor rewording of the recommendation regarding 
recurrent hypertension is introduced in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC  and the warning on hypertension in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC  is amended accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
Annex II  in line with the QRD  template version 9 and 
to update the details of the local representatives in 
the Package Leaflet.

creatinine ratio (UPCR) for the development or worsening 
of proteinuria before each aflibercept administration. 
Patients with a dipstick of ≥2+  for protein or a UPCR  >1 
should undergo a 24 hour urine collection. 
In case of recurrent medically significant or severe 
hypertension despite optimal treatment, ZALTRAP  should 
be suspended until the hypertension is controlled and the 
dose reduced to 2 mg/kg for subsequent cycles. Aflibercept 
should be permanently discontinued if hypertension cannot 
be adequately managed with appropriate anti hypertensive 
therapy or aflibercept dose reduction, or if hypertensive 
crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy occurs.

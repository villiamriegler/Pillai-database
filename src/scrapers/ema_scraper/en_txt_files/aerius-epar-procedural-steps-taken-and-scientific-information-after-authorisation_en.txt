The objective of the retrospective observational post-
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
C.I.13: Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to reflect 
an increased incidence of new-onset seizure in 
patients 0 to 19 years when receiving desloratadine 
compared with periods not receiving desloratadine 
based on the results of the final report from study 
(EUPAS15038) listed as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. This is a non-interventional non-imposed PASS 
study designed to assess the potential risk of 
desloratadine exposure on seizures, supraventricular 
tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation or flutter. In 
addition, section 4.2 of the SmPC is updated to 
remove that “no data are available” in the paediatric 
population and section 4.4 is updated to include a 
cross reference to section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
authorisation safety study (PASS) using person-specific 
linkage of data from the national population registers from 
Denmark, Finland, and Sweden was to assess the potential 
risk of desloratadine (DL) exposure on seizures, 
supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and atrial fibrillation or 
flutter (A-fib/flu). 
The PASS indicated an increased incidence of new-onset 
seizure in patients 0 to 19 years of age when receiving 
desloratadine compared with periods not receiving 
desloratadine. Among children 0-4 years old, the adjusted 
absolute increase was 37.5 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 
10.5-64.5) per 100,000 person years (PY) with a 
background rate of new onset seizure of 80.3 per 100,000 
PY. Among patients 5-19 years of age, the adjusted 
absolute increase was 11.3 (95% CI 2.3-20.2) per 100,000 
PY with a background rate of 36.4 per 100,000 PY. The 
product information already includes a special warning and 
precaution for use on seizures, in addition, it is listed as an 
adverse reaction with a frequency very rare. Nonetheless, 
based on the results of this study, the section 4.8 of the 
SmPC is updated to reflect the increased incidence of new-
onset seizure in patients 0 to 19 years of age receiving DL 
compared with periods not receiving desloratadine. The 
section 4.2 is also updated to remove the sentence that “no

section 4.4 is updated to include a cross reference to 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. The study found no association 
between current use of DL and risk of first SVT. 
The study also found an association between current use of 
DL and risk of first A-fib/flu that persisted after adjustment 
for preselected confounders (aIRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01; 
1.12). In age-stratified analyses, the association was 
strongest for patients aged ≥ 65 years (aIRR 1.08, 95% CI 
1.02; 1.15). In view of the results of this PASS, further 
information is required regarding the risk of A-fib/flu in 
special patient groups and seizure. This will be addressed in 
the next PSUR by the MAH in 2021.

chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was compared with that of 
healthy subjects in one single-dose study and one multiple 
dose study). In the single-dose study, the exposure to 
desloratadine was approximately 2 and 2.5-fold greater in 
subjects with mild to moderate and severe CRI, 
respectively, than in healthy subjects. In the multiple-dose 
study, steady state was reached after Day 11, and 
compared to healthy subjects the exposure to desloratadine 
was ~1.5-fold greater in subjects with mild to moderate 
CRI and ~2.5- fold greater in subjects with severe CRI. In 
both studies, changes in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of 
desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were not 
clinically relevant.

Paediatric population: 
- In a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 
17 years of age, the most common adverse event was 
headache; this occurred in 5.9 % of patients treated with 
desloratadine and 6.9 % of patients receiving placebo.

bradycardia. 
- The adverse event profile associated with overdosage, as 
seen during post marketing use, is similar to that seen with 
therapeutic doses, but the magnitude of the effects can be 
higher. 
- Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Adult population: 
- A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 
1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative nor 
feto/ neonatal toxicity of desloratadine.  
- Cases of alcohol intolerance and intoxication have been 
reported during post marketing use. Therefore, caution is 
recommended if alcohol is taken concomitantly.

Characteristics (SPC) for all pharmaceutical forms and 
section 4.8 of the SPC for Aerius film-coated tablet, 
orodispersible tablet and oral lyophilisate presentations. 
The CHMP also recommended to amend section 4 of the 
Package Leaflet (PL) accordingly. In line with the CHMP's 
recommendation, the MAH included into the relevant 
sections of the SPC/PL the following information: 
- 
there is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with 
the use of desloratadine in children aged 12-17 years; 
- 
efficacy of Aerius syrup has not been investigated 
in paediatric trials in children less than 12 years of age; 
- 
the efficacy of Aerius tablets has not been clearly 
demonstrated in trials with adolescent patients 12 through 
17 years of age;

reformulated syrup. The proposed formulation is mainly 
and PL 
intended for paediatric use. It is a suitable formulation for 
the recommended patient age and the likely duration of the 
treatment, since it is sugar-free, preservative and colorant-
free. The MAH will discontinue, for the EU Member States, 
distribution to local representatives of the desloratadine 
current syrup formulation within an agreed timeframe.

The overall benefit/risk assessment for the orodispersible 
tablets was considered positive. The bioequivalence 
between the already marketed film-coated tablets and the 
orodispersible formulations has been established.

n/a 
Labelling and

for an update of the details of the Polish local 
representative and for a correction of the postal 
codes of several local representatives in the Package

French, Finnish, Norwegian and Italian version of the 
Labelling and Package Leaflet.

activity: 4) with positive rechallenge in 2 of the cases 
(ataxia, abnormal coordination). In the sixth PSUR, three 
new cases of seizures were reported in addition to the 
review of cases of seizures performed in the previous PSUR 
and which identified 18 cases (7 possibly related to the use 
of desloratadine). Further to the assessment of PSUR 6, the 
CHMP concluded that an update of the SPC was necessary 
in order to reflect this information. 
Therefore, the MAH submitted a type II variation to update 
the SPC and provided further data. Based on these data, 
the CHMP concluded that the majority of reported 
extrapyramidal symptoms were psychomotor hyperactivity. 
The CHMP therefore recommended including `psychomotor 
hyperactivity' to section 4.8 of the SPC. In addition, the 
CHMP considered acceptable the inclusion of the term 
`seizures' to section 4.8 of the SPC. Section 4 of the PL has 
been amended accordingly.

The MAH had been requested to submit a review of the 
adoption of the CHMP conclusions on the Benefit-Risk 
Labelling and 
events myalgia, insomnia and dyspnoea, which was 
assessment, to the CHMP conclusions on the fifth 
PL 
submitted with the fifth PSUR. The MAH had also been 
PSUR and to the CHMP conclusions on the 
Supplemental Safety Report for the desloratadine 
containing products. The adverse events "myalgia", 
"insomnia", dyspnoea" and hepatitis" were added to 
section 4.8 of the SPC and reflected in the Package 
Leaflet. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to combine the 
labelling, to change the word "container" to 
"package" in the SPC, labelling and Package Leaflet 
of the syrup and to update the information on the 
local representatives. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
requested to monitor hepatic reactions. 
The MAH had received fifty-one cases of myalgia and other 
related muscle disorders (cramps, twitching, weakness, 
spasms and stiffness). Of the 53 events of insomnia, 21 
cases may have resulted from desloratadine intake 
(positive rechallenge, de-challenge). Although this is a very 
low number in comparison to the market experience, the 
reporting rate of insomnia is probably also very low. The 
review of dyspnoea (incl: bronchospasm and asthma) 
included 91 cases (100 ADRs). Of these 63 were dyspnoea. 
Dyspnoea may be associated with hypersensitivity 
reactions and should therefore be mentioned among the 
symptoms of hypersensitivity in the SPC. The MAH 
therefore applied to include the terms "myalgia", 
"insomnia", and "dyspnoea" in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
One case of well-documented hepatitis with hepatic 
necrosis was identified. A further 19 cases of cholestasis, 
jaundice, hepatocellular damage and hepatitis were found, 
12 of which contained the specific term "hepatitis". 
Although "Elevation of liver enzymes" and "increased 
bilirubin" are listed in the SPC, these were not considered 
to fully cover the possible occurrence of hepatitis. The MAH 
therefore applied for inclusion of the term "hepatitis" in 
section 4.8 of the SPC.

Efficacy and safety in the patient population between 1 and

2 years was supported by an extrapolation of evidence

years. 
from adequate and controlled studies of desloratadine in 
adults and in children between 2 and 12 years of age. The 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
MAH also submitted the results of a single-dose 
Package Leaflet 
pharmacokinetic study (P01341) that enrolled 58 paediatric 
volunteers with allergic disorders age 6 months to <2 years 
and from a 15-day randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group safety study (P01368) in 255 
children age =6 months to <2 years.  
The CHMP concluded that in daily practise it is particularly 
difficult to make the diagnosis of AR in the age group of 1 
to 2 years due to the fact that there are no specific 
pathognomonic symptoms distinguishing between 
infectious and allergic rhinitis and the fact that in this age 
group infectious rhinitis is extremely frequent. However, 
the CHMP consider it acceptable to extend the use of 
desloratadine below the age of 2 years down to 1 year for 
treating AR and CIU as the MAH fulfilled the EU 
requirements for the extension of the medicinal product, 
adequate pharmaco-kinetic studies have been performed 
showing that the product is safe and does not behave 
different in children down to 1 year of age. Furthermore 
adequate information has been added to the SPC (section 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2) informing the prescriber of the 
difficulty in distinguishing AR from other forms of rhinitis in 
the age group below 2 years and of the lack of data to 
support the treatment of infectious rhinitis. 
The corresponding sections of the Package Leaflet (section 
2, 3, and 4) have been updated correspondingly.

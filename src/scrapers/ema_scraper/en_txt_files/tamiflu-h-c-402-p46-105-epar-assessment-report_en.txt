1.  Introduction 
On 8 Dec 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Tamiflu, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The target population included immunocompromised 
(IC) adults (patients ≥18 years of age) and children ≥1 and <18 years of age (including adolescents 
and children <13 years of age) with confirmed influenza infection (<96 hours between symptom onset 
and first dose of study medication). 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures MEA 75 and MEA102. 
•  MEA75:  “To  elucidate  clinical  significance  of  new  resistance  information  in  IC  patients,  the  MAH 
should  provide  results  and  final  reports  from  study  NV20234  (final  CSR  by  end  of  November 
2018)”. 
•  MEA102:  “Immunocompromised  patients  -  The  MAH  should  review  annually  the  safety  of 
oseltamivir  in  IC  patients  up  to  final  submission  of  the  clinical  trial  NV20234  study  report 
(treatment) as flu and season permits. The MAH should provide the efficacy data after finalization 
of NV20234 (Due date: Annually in December/ Final CSR by end of November 2018).” 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
NV20234 – A double blind, randomized, stratified, multicenter trial evaluating conventional and double 
dose oseltamivir in the treatment of immunocompromised patients with influenza is part of a clinical 
development program.  
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The  Investigational  Medical  Product  in  this  study  was  oseltamivir  dry  powder  (reconstituted  to  a 
concentration  of  12  mg/mL;  it  was  confirmed  that  the  concentration  of  6mg/mL  was  not  used  in  the 
study) or 75 mg capsules and matching placebo. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  oseltamivir  in  influenza  treatment  and  prevention  in  influenza-infected 
otherwise healthy patients and at-risk patients (those with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory diseases) 
has been established in a series of clinical studies.  
Prophylaxis  of  influenza  with  oseltamivir  in  immunocompromised  (IC)  patients  has  previously  been 
investigated in study NV20235, a prospective, randomised, double-blind, stratified (by transplant type, 
vaccination  status,  and  age)  multicentre  trial  of  oseltamivir  versus  placebo  for  seasonal  influenza 
prophylaxis for 12 weeks in IC adults (n=475) and children (n=18) of one year of age and older. The 
study  compared  the  conventional  dose  of  oseltamivir  with  placebo.  The  study  was  assessed  within 
variation  II/0069  (Commission  decision  15  March  2010).  No  significant  prophylactic  effect  against

influenza  in  the  investigated  IC  population  with  a  high  vaccination  rate  was  demonstrated  in  that 
study;  therefore,  the  benefit/risk  of  oseltamivir  for  the  prophylaxis  of  influenza  for  IC  patients 
remained  uncertain.  However,  the  safety  profile  was  similar  in  IC  population  as  in  otherwise  healthy 
patients. 
Clinical case reports and small observational patient series reports regarding oseltamivir treatment for 
IC subjects with influenza are briefly reviewed by the MAH in the Clinical Overview dated 14 Nov 2017. 
The previous data indicate good tolerability of oseltamivir (by standard dose) in IC adults and children 
with  different  background  conditions.  One  concern  has  been  prolonged  viral  shedding  in  IC  patients 
treated with oseltamivir, with subsequent emergence of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. 
The  final  primary  objective  of  conducting  study  NV20235  was  to  evaluate  safety  and  resistance  of 
oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in IC patients and characterize the effects of oseltamivir in IC 
patients on the development of resistant influenza virus. Secondarily, the study aimed to evaluate the 
efficacy of conventional and double dose of oseltamivir in IC patients. 
Including a placebo control arm in the study was considered unethical for the high risk population. The 
development  of  resistance  following  treatment  with  oseltamivir  (one  of  the  primary  objectives  of  the 
study)  was  considered  an  objective  assessment  (determined  by  laboratory  tests)  and  unlikely  to  be 
impacted by the absence of a placebo arm. 
The pivotal registration trials for oseltamivir in healthy adults with influenza had three treatment arms, 
two active (75 mg and 150 mg) and one placebo. Both treatment arms were found to be significantly 
better  than  placebo.  No  statistical  comparisons  were  made  between  the  two  active  treatment  arms. 
Evaluation  of  the  results  in  the  two  active  treatment  arms  did  not  reveal  any  clinically  meaningful 
difference.  However,  the  proportion  of  subjects  shedding  virus  on  day  4  (3  days  after  the  start  of 
treatment),  suggested  a  possible  dose  response  relationship.  Because  defective  immune-mediated 
virus  clearance  in  IC  patients  treated  with  antivirals  can  result  in  a  higher  incidence  of  selection  of 
drug-resistant viruses, it was decided to use both the conventional and high dose arm for this study. A 
longer  duration  of  treatment  was  chosen  because  a  large  retrospective  study  has  shown  that  the 
median  duration  of  viral  shedding  of  7  days  was  greater  for  HSCT  recipients  than  that  seen  in  the 
healthy children, adult and elderly population with influenza. 
The  NV20234  study  protocol  was  amended  five  times  during  the  course  of  the  study.  The  primary 
endpoint  was  changed  during  the  course  of  the  study.  There  are  two  co-primary  endpoints  for  this 
study – safety/tolerability and resistance to oseltamivir. “Time to resolution of all influenza symptoms” 
was the primary endpoint in versions A and B of the protocol. However, this endpoint was relegated to 
a  secondary  endpoint.  The  rationale  for  the  change  of  primary  endpoint  is  stated  to  be,  firstly,  that 
originally  response  to  placebo  in  pivotal  oseltamivir  registration  trials  in  the  healthy  adult  population 
with influenza was chosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial; as a placebo arm 
was  considered  unethical.  In  order  to  do  this,  the  protocol  was  designed  to  be  similar  to  that  in  the 
pivotal registration trials, only patients with influenza symptoms for <48 h were to be enrolled. There 
were  several  limitations  to  this  original  approach,  the  main  being  in  healthy  subjects  the  influenza 
virus  faster than in IC subjects. The need to enroll patients within 48 hours  of the onset of influenza 
resulted  in  several  patients  being  ineligible  for  screening.  This  required  modification  of  the  inclusion 
criteria  to  allow  patients  who  had  been  symptomatic  with  influenza  for  more  than  48  hours  to  be 
enrolled in the study. This imposed an even greater limitation on the ability to compare data between 
healthy  subjects  on  placebo  enrolled  within  48  hours  from  pivotal  registration  trials  with  IC  subjects 
who received oseltamivir within 96 hours.

Furthermore, since the original study design, and particularly following the pandemic, there has been 
increasing  evidence  for  efficacy  in  the  immunocompromised  population.  National  guidelines  now 
recommend  the  use  of  anti-virals  for  the  treatment  of  influenza  in  the  transplant  population.  In 
immunocompromised patients, however, there remains the risk for resistance. It was therefore decided 
to  revise  the  primary  objective  of  this  study  to  the  descriptive  characterization  of  safety,  tolerability 
and resistance. 
Other  amendments  included  e.g.  the  following:  inclusion  criteria  were  widened  to  cover  more 
background  IC  conditions  to  enhance  recruitment;  sequencing  of  the  neuraminidase  (NAI)  and 
hemagglutinin  (HA)  genes  was  extended  from  original  plan;  PK  assessment  reference  to  oseltamivir 
was removed as only oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) was evaluated in plasma samples; etc.  
The MAH submitted a final report for:

Study design 
NV20234 was a Phase III, double-blind, randomized, stratified, multicenter study of conventional and 
double  dose  oseltamivir  for  the  treatment  of  influenza  in  IC  patients.  Immunocompromised  patients, 
who  developed  an  influenza-like  illness  and  tested  positive  with  a  rapid  diagnostic  test,  reverse 
transcription−polymerase  chain  reaction  (RT-PCR),  or  viral  culture  for  influenza,  were  enrolled  during 
the influenza season.  
The study collected data from 228 patients between 4 February 2008 and 02 May 2017. There were 62 
active  study  centres in  19  countries:  USA  (16),  South  Africa  (7),  Mexico  (5),  Lithuania  (4),  Italy  (4), 
Belgium (3), Spain (3), Brazil (3), Argentina (3), Israel (3), Estonia (2), Guatemala (2), Ukraine (1), 
Latvia (1), Poland (1) Bulgaria (1), Chile (1) Colombia (1), and Hungary (1). 
IC  patients,  who  developed  an  influenza-like  illness  and  tested  positive  with  a  rapid  diagnostic  test, 
polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR),  or  viral  culture  for  influenza,  were  enrolled  during  the  influenza 
season.  After  providing  informed  consent,  eligible  patients  were  randomized  to  receive  oseltamivir 
twice daily for 10 days at one of two doses: conventional dose or double dose (double the conventional 
dose). 
Enrolled  patients  were  randomized  1:1  to  conventional  oseltamivir  or  double  dose  oseltamivir, 
stratified according to 4 binary factors: transplant status (SOT, HSCT or yes, no); time between onset 
of influenza symptoms and treatment start (≤24 hours, >24 hours or up to 96 hours, ≤48 hours, >48 
hours);  influenza  vaccination  status  for  current  influenza  season  (yes,  no),  and  age  (≤12  years,  >12 
years). 
Two  follow-up  visits  were  scheduled  approximately  5  and  30  days  after  the  last  dose.  Blood  samples 
for the characterization of oseltamivir and OC pharmacokinetics using a sparse sampling strategy were 
collected (from all patients who opted to participate in the PK assessments) on Day 6, or any day after 
the 11th dose. 
For pharmacodynamic (PD) and virology assessments, two nasopharyngeal swabs and one throat swab 
were  collected  from  individuals  at  each  visit  as  specified  in  the  schedule  of  assessments.  All  swabs 
were  sent  to  a  central  laboratory  for  RT-PCR  (reverse  transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction),  viral 
culture testing, assessment of influenza virus shedding, and viral resistance monitoring. At the end of 
treatment (EOT, Day 11), a rapid diagnostic test was permitted for confirmation of ongoing influenza. 
Participation  in  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  assessments  was  not  compulsory.  Blood  samples  for  the 
characterization  of  oseltamivir  and  OC  pharmacokinetics  using  a  sparse  sampling  strategy  were 
collected from all patients who provided additional consent to participate in the PK assessments. 
Enrolled  patients  recorded  influenza  signs  and  symptoms  on  a  diary  card  which  was  dispensed  on 
Study  Day  1.  Adult  and  adolescent  patients  (>13  years  and  older)  completed  a  symptom  score  card 
comprising 7 symptoms of influenza. Parents/guardians of children <13 years and younger completed 
a diary comprising 18 symptoms of influenza based on the Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness Flu Scale 
(CARIFS). 
Study population /Sample size 
Immunocompromised adults (patients ≥18 years of age) and children ≥1 and <18 years of age 
(including adolescents and children <13 years of age) with confirmed influenza infection (<96 hours 
between symptom onset and first dose of study medication). Patients with severe hepatic 
decompensation were excluded.

Statistical Methods 
The SAP was updated several times together with protocol amendments.  
The sample size was chosen to provide an adequate number of patients to estimate the development 
of resistance (genotypic and/or phenotypic, co-primary endpoint) with reasonable precision. Assuming 
that 90% of enrolled patients would have laboratory-confirmed influenza, there would be 75 patients in 
each treatment arm in the population evaluable for the development of resistance. Table 1 shows the 
95%  Pearson-Clopper  CIs  that  would  result  with  a  sample  size  of  75  patients  in  a  treatment  arm  if 
certain rates of resistance are observed in the study.  
Table 1. 
A total of 83 patients evaluable for the assessment of safety (co-primary endpoint) were to be enrolled 
per  treatment  arm.  This  number  of  patients  would  provide  estimates  of  adverse  event  rates  with 
similar precision. 
Five patient populations were used for the analysis of data from this study: 
•  Safety analysis population:  all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had 
a safety assessment performed post randomization. All safety variables were summarized and 
presented in tables. 
• 
• 
Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  Population:  All  patients  randomized,  excluding  non-IC  patients;  used 
mainly to summarize efficacy endpoints for the purposes of sensitivity analyses. 
Intent-to-Treat Infected (ITTi) Population: All patients randomized and with central laboratory 
confirmation  of  influenza  infection,  excluding  patients  infected  with  oseltamivir-resistant 
influenza  at  baseline  and  non-IC  patients.  The  ITTi  population  was  the  protocol-defined 
population to summarize all efficacy and resistance endpoints. 
•  Modified  Intent-to-Treat  Infected  (mITTi)  Population:  All  patients  randomized  to  a  particular 
treatment,  regardless  of  whether  they  received  that  treatment  or  not,  who  received  at  least 
one  dose  of  study  drug  and  with  central  laboratory  confirmation  of  influenza  infection, 
excluding patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza at baseline and excluding non-
IC  patients.  The  mITTi  population  was  used  as  the  primary  analysis  population  for  resistance 
endpoints, and was used to summarize all efficacy endpoints in addition to the ITTi population, 
as it was expected to render the least biased estimates.

• 
Pharmacokinetic  evaluable  patient  (PKEP)  population  comprised  all  patients  in  the  ITT 
population  who  had  at  least  one  valid  post-dose  drug  concentration  measurement  at  a 
scheduled  visit  timepoint.  Patients  could  be  excluded  from  the  PKEP  population  if  they 
significantly violated the inclusion or exclusion criteria, deviated significantly from the protocol, 
or had unavailable or had incomplete data that could have influenced the PK analysis. Non-IC 
patients were excluded. 
Safety was summarized descriptively for adult patients ≥18 years of age and then separately for 
children aged <18 years (adolescents and children <13 years) in the Safety population. 
The ITTi population was the protocol-defined population to summarize all efficacy and resistance 
endpoints. The mITTi population was the SAP-defined primary analysis population for resistance 
endpoints, and was used was to summarize all efficacy endpoints in addition to the ITTi population. 
For resistance analyses, the proportion and associated exact Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs of patients with 
post-baseline genotypic or phenotypic resistance were summarized by treatment group for all patients 
regardless of age. 
As no formal hypothesis testing was performed for any efficacy endpoints, treatment differences 
presented for any efficacy analyses were supported with associated CIs only. Efficacy summaries and 
analyses were split by age group: by adults (patients ≥18 years), pooled data for adults and  
adolescents (patients ≥13 years), and children aged <13 years. 
The TTR of all symptoms in adults in the miTTi population was compared with 1:1-matched historical 
otherwise healthy (OwH) placebo and treated controls from pivotal registration studies, supported by 
95% and 90% CIs. Also, as sensitivity analyses, similar comparisons using 1:>1-matched OwH and at-
risk (patients with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory diseases) historical placebo and treated controls 
were performed. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 843 patients were screened, of which 228 patients were enrolled into the study at 62 active 
centres in 19 countries. The main reason for screen failure was the inability to meet inclusion criterion 
2 (being positive for influenza by rapid diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture assay at the site). The 
majority of patients (58.3% [133/228]) were enrolled during the 2012−2013, 2013−2014, and 
2014−2015 flu seasons. 
Of the 228 enrolled patients, 207 were adults (≥18 years) and 20 were children (patients <18 years). 
No age information was available for 1 patient (who was randomized but not dosed and was only 
included in the ITT population). The 228 enrolled patients were randomized: 113 to the conventional 
dose group and 115 to the double dose group (Figure 1). Of these, 220 patients (109 in the 
conventional dose group and 111 in the double dose group) received at least 1 dose of oseltamivir, and 
199 patients (99 in the conventional dose group and 100 in the double dose group) completed the 
study.

Figure 1 Patient Disposition (All Enrolled Patients) 
From all enrolled, 24 adults and 4 children were withdrawn mostly due to loss to follow-up and consent 
withdrawal. One discontinuation occurred due to safety reasons (a fatal AE, recurrent leukemia).  
Of  the  228  patients  enrolled  and  randomized  in  the  study,  215  patients  were  included  in  the  Safety 
population (16 children aged <18 years), 226 patients in the ITT population (20 children), 169 patients 
in the ITTi population (17 children), 167 patients in the mITTi population (16 children), and 26 patients 
in the PKEP population (4 children). 
Among the adult patients in the Safety population, 22 patients (10 in the conventional and 12 in the 
double  dose  group)  discontinued  treatment.  Of  these  8  patients  (3  in  the  conventional  and  5  in  the 
double dose group) discontinued due to AEs; which  included pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, epistaxis, 
headache,  pulmonary  tuberculosis,  pruritus,  renal  failure,  sepsis,  and  hallucination.  Therefore,  177 
adult  patients  in  the  Safety  population  completed  the  study;  and  16  children  aged  <18  years 
completed the study. 
Baseline data 
Demographic data 
In  the  Safety  population,  the  majority  of  adult  patients  ≥18  years  were  Caucasian  (65.8%),  non-
Hispanic (84.4%), and the proportion of females (57.3%) was higher than males (42.7%), The mean 
age of adult patients was 46.2 years. (range: 18−90 years), and the majority of patients (90.5%) were 
≤64 years of age. At baseline, 17.6% of adult patients had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza 
and 42.7% were transplant recipients. The overall mean time from onset of symptoms to the start of 
drug  was  50.2  hours  (range:  7.7−94.0  hours).  The  demographic  characteristics  were  generally 
balanced between the treatment groups, except for the mean time from symptom onset to treatment

start, which was shorter in the conventional dose group (47.5 hours) compared with the double dose 
group (53.2 hours). 
In  children  aged  <18  years,  the  majority  were  Caucasian  (81.3%),  non-Hispanic  (68.8%),  and  the 
proportion  of  males  (68.8%)  was  higher  than  females  (31.3%).  The  mean  age  of  these  patients  was 
10.1  years  (range:  4−17  years),  with  the  majority  (56.3%)  aged  ≤12  years  of  age.  At  baseline,  3 
children  (18.8%)  had  been  vaccinated  against  seasonal  influenza  and  3  (18.8%)  were  transplant 
recipients. The mean time from onset of symptoms  to the start of treatment was 48.8  hours (range: 
8.4−89.6  hours).  The  demographic  characteristics  were  generally  balanced  between  the  treatment 
groups. 
In the mITTi population, (the primary analysis population for resistance and efficacy endpoints), 19.8% 
of patients had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza, 51.3% entered the study ≤48 hours after 
the onset of symptoms, and the majority (70.7%) did not present with fever at baseline. 
At  baseline,  164  patients  (98.2%)  had  central  laboratory-confirmed  influenza  infection  (by  RT-PCR). 
The  majority  of  patients  (67.1%)  had  influenza  type  A,  with  the  H3N2  strain  being  the  most 
predominant  (45.5%);  18.6%  of  patients  had  the  A/H1N1  (2009)  strain.  The  proportion  of  patients 
who were positive for influenza type B was 30.5%. 
Three  patients  had  unknown  influenza  type  at  baseline,  and  were  later  identified  to  be  positive  for 
influenza type B during the study. 
Safety results 
In adults (patients aged ≥18 years)  
• 
• 
Treatment  exposure  in  terms  of  mean  dose  intensity,  defined  as  the  percentage  of  doses 
received  divided  by  the  expected  doses,  was  high  and  similar  between  treatment  groups 
(88.8% in the conventional dose group vs. 90.9% in the double dose group). 
The proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse events (AE) was higher in the 
double dose group (59.4%) compared with the conventional dose group (49.0%) (table 2). 
•  Serious  adverse  events  (SAE)  occurred  in  7/98  (7.1%)  of  subjects  administered  conventional 
dose and 9/101 (8.9%) of subjects administered double dose of oseltamivir. None of the SAE 
were considered related to study medication (table 2). 
•  A  higher  proportion  of  adult  patients  in  the  double  dose  group  experienced  AEs  leading  to 
withdrawal  from  treatment  (5.0%  vs.  3.1%),  related  AEs  (5.0%  vs.  2.0%),  and  related  AEs 
leading to withdrawal from treatment compared with the conventional dose (2% vs. 1%). Two 
subjects  in  the  conventional  dose  group  and  none  in  the  double  dose  group  experienced  AE 
leading to dose modification/interruption. 
•  Of  all  AE,  2  (2.0%)  in  the  conventional  dose  group  and  5  (5.0%)  in  the  double  dose  group 
were  considered  to  be  related,  and  altogether  3  subjects  withdrew  from  treatment  due  to 
related AE, one in the conventional dose group and two in the double dose group (table 2).

Table 2 Overall Incidence of Adverse Events (All Patients, Safety Population) 
• 
Incidence  of  on-treatment  AEs  was  higher  in  the  double  dose  group  (46.5%)  compared  with 
the  conventional  dose  group  (38.8%).  Overall,  the  most  common  AEs  (≥3%  in  either 
treatment arm) were vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, pneumonia, anaemia, dizziness, 
and muscle spasms (table 3). 
•  One  adult  patient  (1.0%)  in  the  double  dose  group  died  during  the  study  due  to  an  off-
treatment  AE  with  fatal  outcome  (Grade  5;  recurrent  leukemia).  The  event  was  considered 
unrelated  to  oseltamivir  by  the  investigator.  No  adults  died  due  to  AEs  with  fatal  outcome  in 
the conventional dose group. 
• 
There were no new safety signals identified in adult IC patients treated with oseltamivir.

Treatment exposure in terms of mean dose intensity was higher in the conventional dose group 
(94.3%  vs.  80.6%  in  the  double  dose  group),  indicating  more  patients  who  received  the 
conventional  dose  received  the  full  10-day  course  of  treatment  with  fewer  treatment 
discontinuations. 
The  proportion  of  children  who  experienced  at  least  one  AE  was  higher  in  the  conventional 
dose  group  (5  patients  [71.4%])  compared  with  the  double  dose  group  (5  patients  [55.6%]) 
(table 4). 
There was  no indication of clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs during 
the course of treatment.

Resistance results 
Baseline 
Of the 226 IC patients in this study (ITT population), influenza virus infection was centrally confirmed 
by RT-PCR in a total of 175 patients at baseline. Baseline resistance assessment was performed using 
H274Y mutation-specific RT-PCR, population sequencing, and/or phenotyping assay.  
In  the  ITT  population,  the  overall  incidence  of  baseline  resistance  (genotypic  and/or  phenotypic)  was 
low.  Six  patients  (4  in  the  conventional  dose  group  and  2  in  the  double  dose  group)  had  oseltamivir 
resistance  detected  in  their  baseline  sample:  two  influenza  type  A/H1N1-infected  patients  had 
genotypic  resistance,  with  an  H274Y  mutation  detected  by  the  H274Y  mutation-specific  RT-PCR; 
whereas  2  influenza  type  A/H3N2-infected  patients  and  2  influenza  type  B-infected  patients  had  an 
outlier phenotype with a 2.7- to 4-fold increase in IC50 values from the baseline mean. All 6 patients 
were aged ≥13 years (5 adults and 1 adolescent). 
Due to detection of the H274Y mutation at baseline using RT-PCR methodology performed in real time, 
the  2  patients  (1  in  each  treatment  group)  with  genotypic  resistance  were  withdrawn  from  study 
treatment  (at  Day  5  for  the  patient  receiving  the  conventional  dose  and  at  Day  4  for  the  patient

receiving  the  double  dose);  the  remaining  4  patients  with  phenotypic  baseline  resistance  completed 
the full 10-day treatment. 
The median baseline viral load (as determined by RT-PCR)  for the 6 patients with baseline resistance 
was 6.23 log10 vp/mL and was comparable to the median baseline viral load obtained for adults and 
patients aged <18 years. 
Cessation  of  viral  shedding,  as  determined  by  RT-PCR,  occurred  before  EOT  for  2  patients  in  the 
conventional  dose  group,  and  after  EOT  for  1  patient  in  the  conventional  dose  group  and  for  both 
patients  in  the  double  dose  group.  Viral  shedding  was  still  positive  for  1  patient  in  the  conventional 
dose group at the last evaluated timepoint (FU Day 15). 
Alleviation of all symptoms (scores ≤1) occurred before EOT for 1 patient in the conventional dose, and 
for both patients in the double dose group, at EOT for the 1 patient in the conventional dose group, 
and at Day 18 for 1 patient in the conventional dose group. One patient in the conventional dose group 
was still experiencing influenza symptoms at the last evaluated timepoint (FU Day 31). 
Narratives for these 6 patients, including all virology-associated results, are provided in the CSR. 
Post-baseline 
Post-baseline  resistance  assessment  was  performed  using  population  sequencing  and/or  phenotyping 
assay.  The  incidence  of  post-baseline  resistance  was  estimated  using  the  mITTi  population,  which 
excluded  patients  with  baseline  resistance.  It  should  be  noted  that  for  some  patients  in  the  mITTi 
population,  resistance  monitoring  was  incomplete  (i.e.,  only  phenotypic  or  genotypic  resistance 
assessment was available, mainly due to the limitations of the 2 assays) or not done (especially in the 
early influenza seasons of the study). 
Patients for whom both genotypic and phenotypic resistance were detected were counted only once in 
the  overall  resistance  rate.  A  total  of  15  patients  had  oseltamivir  (treatment-emergent)  resistance 
detected in one or several of their post-baseline samples: 12 patients in the conventional dose group 
and  3  patients  in  the  double  dose  group.  All  15  patients  had  completed  the  full  10  days  of  study 
treatment. Of these, 11 had received a transplant (5 SOT patients and 6 HSCT patients). 
Specifically  in  the  conventional  dose  group,  9  of  40  patients  (22.5%;  95%  CI:  10.84−38.45)  who 
received  a  transplant  developed  resistance  compared  with  3  of  41  patients  (7.3%;  95%  CI: 
1.54−19.92) who did not received a transplant and developed resistance. 
Among  adults  (patients  ≥18  years)  in  the  mITTi  population,  the  overall  post-baseline  resistance  rate 
was  13.7%  (10  patients)  in  the  conventional  dose  group  and  2.6%  (2  patients)  in  the  double  dose 
group.  The  virus  type(subtype)s  were  A(H1N1)(2009)  in  five  patients,  A(H1N1)  in  one  patient, 
A(H3N2) in four patients and B in 2 patients. 
Of the 16 children aged <18 years in the mITTi population, 2/8 patients in the conventional dose group 
and  1/8  patient  in  the  double  dose  group  developed  post-baseline  resistance;  all  3  patients  were 
children aged <12 years old. Two children had influenza A(H1N1)(2009) and one A(H3N2) virus. 
As a summary, in the mITTi population: 
•  Baseline resistance was rare and was detected in 6 patients. 
• 
In adults (patients aged ≥18 years), 13.7% of patients in the conventional dose group and 
2.6% of patients in the double dose group developed post-baseline oseltamivir resistance.

• 
• 
In children aged <18 years, 2 patients (25.0%) in the conventional dose group and 1 patient 
(12.5%) in the double dose group developed post-baseline oseltamivir resistance; these 3 
patients were children <12 years of age. 
Treatment-emergent resistance was observed mostly in influenza type A-infected patients and 
patients who had prolonged viral shedding. 
Clinical outcomes in patients with treatment-emergent resistance 
Among the 12 adults with post-baseline treatment-emergent resistance (genotypic and/or phenotypic), 
the resolution of all symptoms occurred before EOT for 8 patients in the conventional dose group and 1 
patient  in  the  double  dose  group.  For  the  remaining  3  patients,  all  symptoms  resolved  after  EOT  (at 
Day 12 and Day 16 for 2 patients in the conventional dose group, and at Day 11 for 1 patient in the 
double dose group).  
The median TTR of all symptoms in adult and adolescent patients with treatment-emergent resistance 
was  slightly  longer  than  in  patients  without  treatment-emergent  resistance  (137.6  hours  [95% 
CI:43.7, 183.6] in the conventional dose group and 149.2 hours [95% CI: not estimable] in the double 
dose  group);  however  the  small  number  of  patients  in  these  two  groups  (10  patients  in  the 
conventional dose group and 2 patients in the double dose group) limits data interpretation. 
Among  the  3  children  (patients  <13  years)  with  treatment-emergent  resistance  (genotypic  and/or 
phenotypic),  resolution  of  all  symptoms  occurred  before  EOT  for  the  2  patients  in  the  conventional 
dose group, and after EOT (at Day 22) for 1 patient in the double dose group. 
Efficacy results 
A  summary  of  key  efficacy  findings  in  the  mITTi  population  is  presented  below.  Results  of  the  key 
efficacy analyses of TTR of all symptoms, TTR of fever, and time to cessation of viral shedding in the 
ITTi population were identical to the mITTi population (these populations differed by only 2 patients [1 
adult and 1 child aged <13 years] who did not have time-to-event data). 
In  the  mITTi  population,  the  TTR  of  all  symptoms  was  analysed  in  adults  and  adolescents  (patients 
aged ≥13 years) with or without treatment-emergent resistance. The median TTR of all symptoms was 
similar in both treatment groups in patients without treatment-emergent resistance (107.0 hours [95% 
CI: 53.0, 143.9] in the conventional dose group and 107.2 hours [95% CI: 54.8, 147.7] in the double 
dose group) and these results are consistent with the overall median TTR of all symptoms observed in 
this population. 
• 
There was no difference in median TTR of all symptoms in adults aged ≥18 years between the 
2  oseltamivir  doses  (103.3  hours  [95%  CI:  69.0,  112.7]  in  the  conventional  dose  group  vs. 
103.6 hours [95% CI: 57.1, 140.0] in the double dose); the 95% CIs were overlapping. 
–  The  median  TTR  of  all  symptoms  between  IC  oseltamivir-treated  adult  patients  and  a  1:1-
matched  historical  OwH  placebo  control  from  pivotal  registration  trials  was  shorter  by  13.5 
hours. 
However,  the  CIs  (90%  and  95%)  overlapped.  Of  note,  the  median  TTR  was  comparable 
between  IC  patients  and  the  OwH  treated  controls  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  were 
treated ≤48 hours of symptom onset, with overlapping 95% and 90% CIs. 
• 
In the absence of a placebo control in this study, the median TTR of all symptoms in adult IC 
patients in the mITTi population was compared against a historical control of OwH placebo and

treated  adult  patients  from  pivotal  registration  trials  of  oseltamivir.  As  there  was  little 
difference between the oseltamivir conventional and double dose groups in the median TTR of 
all symptoms, these groups were pooled together (combined IC group) and compared with the 
historical  matched  OwH  placebo  controls  as  well  as  with  the  matched  OwH  treated  controls. 
When  compared  with  1:1-matched  historical  at-risk  placebo  and  treated  controls,  the  median 
TTR of all symptoms was notably shorter (by 54.2 hours and 36 hours, respectively) with little 
or no overlap in the 95% and 90% CIs; however, the at-risk patients had confounding factors 
that contributed to a longer median TTR of symptoms. 
The median TTR of all symptoms in adults and adolescents (patients aged ≥13 years, pooled) 
was comparable between the 2 doses (103.4 hours [95% CI: 75.4, 122.7] in the conventional 
dose group vs. 107.2 hours [95% CI: 63.9, 140.0] in the double dose group) with overlapping 
95%  CIs.  The  median  TTR  was  longer  in  patients  with  treatment-emergent  resistance 
compared with that in patients without resistance. 
The  median  TTR  of  fever  in  adults  and  adolescents  (patients  aged  ≥13  years)  was  longer  by 
10.5 hours in the conventional dose group; however, the 95% CIs overlapped. 
There  were  no  differences  in  the  TTR  of  individual  symptoms  between  the  two  doses  of 
oseltamivir in adults and  adolescents (patients aged ≥13 years); the 95%  CIs overlapped for 
all  symptoms.  Symptoms  of  chills/sweats  (feverish)  and  headache  resolved  the  fastest  with 
both doses. 
The time to cessation of viral shedding was 24 hours shorter (by RT-PCR) in adults treated with 
double  dose  oseltamivir  compared  with  the  conventional  dose.  This  difference  may  be  due  to 
the  larger  number  of  patients  in  the  conventional  dose  that  developed  treatment-emergent 
resistance and had corresponding prolonged viral shedding. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The small number of IC children aged <13 years limits data interpretation of the comparisons of TTR of 
all symptoms and fever in this age group. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
A total of 26 patients (11 in the conventional dose group and 15 in the double dose group) with PK 
samples were available for the analysis. Of these, four were aged below 18 years. These data were 
used in the modelling described below, but data are only summarized for adults aged ≥18 years given 
the limited paediatric data. 
Concentrations of oseltamivir and OC in adults in the double dose group were approximately two times 
higher than those in the conventional dose group (Figures 2 and 3).

Using popPK modelling, the mean and geometric mean of oseltamivir Cmax were similar to data from 
historical trials of oseltamivir in generally OwH non-IC patients, whereas Ctrough and AUC were slightly 
higher than those observed in the historical trials. The mean and geometric mean of OC Ctrough and

AUC were approximately two times higher than those observed with historical trials. Approximately 
50% of this difference can be attributed to lower OC clearance estimated for patients from this study, 
and the other half can be attributed by lower than normal estimated creatinine clearance in this study 
relative to the historic data. Oseltamivir and OC exposure metrics in the double dose group were 
approximately two times higher than those in the conventional dose group confirming the linear 
increase of oseltamivir and OC exposure with dose. 
The PK modelling methods are not assessed in this AR but will be scrutinised when the results are used 
later in the Type II variations affecting Product Information. 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Exposure-response analysis was conducted in 20 adults aged ≥18 years with evaluable efficacy data 
(resolution  of  influenza  symptoms  and  virologic  course  of  influenza).  The  low  sample  size  of  children 
aged <18 years (n=4) precluded a separate ER analysis in these patients. Only Ctrough for OC was used 
for  the  ER  analysis.  No  notable  exposure-efficacy  relationships  were  identified,  although  the  sample 
size was too low to make any definite conclusions. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In  summary,  the  data  from  study  NV20234  of  conventional  or  double  dose  oseltamivir  administered 
BID over 10 days for the treatment of seasonal influenza in IC patients demonstrate that: 
•  Both  doses  of  oseltamivir  were  generally  well  tolerated  in  adults  and  children,  with  a  trend 
toward  better  safety  with  the  conventional  dose.  No  new  safety  signals  were  observed.  The 
nature  and  severity  of  AEs  were  consistent  with  the  established  safety  profile  of  oseltamivir, 
the  typical  complications  influenza  infection,  and  the  associated  comorbidities/concomitant 
medications used in IC patients. 
Treatment-emergent  oseltamivir  resistance  appeared  to  be  higher  with  the  conventional  dose 
compared  with  the  double  dose  in  both  adults  and  children  aged  <18  years,  although  the 
frequency observed for either dose was not unduly high considering the immunocompromised 
population studied. 
Emergence of resistance seemed to be associated more with patients with influenza-type A and 
• 
• 
patients with prolonged viral shedding. 
•  Overall, the TTR of all symptoms was similar between the two doses of oseltamivir. 
– A shorter TTR of all symptoms was seen with oseltamivir treatment in adults when compared 
with the historical OwH placebo control; however, the 95% CIs were overlapping. The 90% CIs 
for this comparison were also overlapping but to a lesser extent. 
–  When  compared  with  1:>1-matched  historical  at-risk  placebo  and  treated  controls,  the 
median TTR of all symptoms was notably shorter with little or no overlap in the 95% and 90% 
CIs; however, the at-risk patients had confounding factors that contributed to a longer median 
TTR of symptoms. 
–  The  TTR  of  all  symptoms  was  also  longer  in  patients  with  resistance  in  both  treatment 
groups. 
•  Virologic  data  based  on  RT-PCR  indicated  that  both  doses  of  oseltamivir  result  in  a  similar 
decline  in  viral  load  and  viral  shedding  in  adults  and  children  aged  <18  years.  In  adults,  the 
time to cessation of viral shedding was shorter with the double dose of oseltamivir, with lower 
levels of virus shed over time.

•  Oseltamivir and OC exposure metrics in the double dose group were approximately two times 
higher than those in the conventional dose group confirming the linear increase of oseltamivir 
and OC exposure with dose. 
•  No notable exposure-response relationships were observed in the PK/PD analyses. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Tamiflu (NV20234 – A double blind, randomized, 
stratified,  multicenter  trial  evaluating  conventional  and  double  dose  oseltamivir  in  the  treatment  of 
immunocompromised patients with influenza; the study included both adult and paediatric patients), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.  
The  results  of  study  NV20234  do  not  alter  the  benefit  risk  balance  of  oseltamivir.  A  double  dose  of 
oseltamivir  administered  over  10  days  may  be  slightly  more  beneficial  than  conventional  dose 
regarding  evolution  of  treatment-emergent  oseltamivir  resistance  and  duration  of  viral  shedding  in 
immunocompromised (IC) adults.  The low number of children in the study limits drawing conclusions 
on  efficacy  of  both  doses.  Overall,  the  described  safety  findings  are  in  line  with  the  already  known 
profile reflected in the SmPC, even though conventional dose is slightly better tolerated.  
The requirement to submit the results of this paediatric study NV20234 in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, has been thus fulfilled.  
Further, the post-authorisation measures MEA 75 and MEA102 are also considered to be fulfilled now:. 
•  MEA75:  “To  elucidate  clinical  significance  of  new  resistance  information  in  IC  patients,  the  MAH 
should  provide  results  and  final  reports  from  study  NV20234  (final  CSR  by  end  of  November 
2018)”. 
•  MEA102:  “Immunocompromised  patients  -  The  MAH  should  review  annually  the  safety  of 
oseltamivir  in  IC  patients  up  to  final  submission  of  the  clinical  trial  NV20234  study  report 
(treatment) as flu and season permits. The MAH should provide the efficacy data after finalization 
of NV20234 (Due date: Annually in December/ Final CSR by end of November 2018).”

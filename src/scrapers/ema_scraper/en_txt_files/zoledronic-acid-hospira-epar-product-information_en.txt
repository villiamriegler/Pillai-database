3  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Concentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate) 
Clear and colourless solution. 
4  CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
- 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone.  
- 
Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Zoledronic acid must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare professionals 
experienced in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients treated with zoledronic 
acid should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card.  
Posology 
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone 
Adults and elderly 
The recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks.  
Patients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D 
daily.  
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months.

Treatment of TIH 
Adults and elderly 
The recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium  12.0 mg/dl or 
3.0 mmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid.  
Renal impairment 
TIH: 
Zoledronic acid treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be considered 
only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum 
creatinine > 400 µmol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is necessary in TIH 
patients with serum creatinine < 400 µmol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4).  
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone: 
When initiating treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone 
lesions from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. 
CLcr is calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Zoledronic acid is not 
recommended for patients presenting with severe renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which 
is defined for this population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials with zoledronic acid, patients with 
serum creatinine > 265 µmol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded.  
In patients with bone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation 
of therapy, which is defined for this population as CLcr 30–60 ml/min, the following zoledronic acid 
dose is recommended (see also section 4.4):  
Baseline creatinine clearance (ml/min) 
Zoledronic Acid Recommended Dose*

50–60 
40–49 
30–39 
4.0 mg zoledronic acid 
3.5 mg* zoledronic acid 
3.3 mg* zoledronic acid 
3.0 mg* zoledronic acid 
* Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg•hr/l) (CLcr = 75 ml/min). The 
reduced doses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in 
patients with creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min.  
Following initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of zoledronic 
acid and treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, renal 
deterioration was defined as follows:  
- 
- 
For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 µmol/l), an increase of 
0.5 mg/dl or 44 µmol/l;  
For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 µmol/l), an increase of 
1.0 mg/dl or 88 µmol/l.  
In the clinical studies, zoledronic acid treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned 
to within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zoledronic acid treatment should be resumed at 
the same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been 
established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made.  
Method of administration 
Intravenous use.  
Zoledronic Acid Hospira concentrate for solution for infusion, further diluted in 100 ml (see section 
6.6), should be given as a single intravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes.  
In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced zoledronic acid doses are recommended 
(see section “Posology” above and section 4.4).  
Instructions for preparing reduced doses of Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
Withdraw an appropriate volume of the concentrate needed, as follows:  
- 
- 
- 
4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose  
4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose  
3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose  
For instructions on the dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. The 
withdrawn amount of concentrate must be further diluted in 100 ml of sterile 0.9% w/v sodium 
chloride solution for injection (see section 4.4) or 5% w/v glucose solution. The dose must be given as 
a single intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes.  
Zoledronic Acid Hospira must not be mixed with calcium or other divalent cation-containing infusion 
solutions such as lactated Ringer's solution, and should be administered as a single intravenous 
solution in a separate infusion line.  
Patients must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Patients must be assessed prior to administration of zoledronic acid to ensure that they are adequately 
hydrated.  
Overhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure.  
Standard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate 
and magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating zoledronic acid therapy. If 
hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy 
may be necessary. Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function 
impairment, therefore careful renal function monitoring should be considered.  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other products containing zoledronic acid as active substance are available for osteoporosis 
indications and treatment of Paget´s disease of the bone. Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira should not be treated with such products or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, since the 
combined effects of these agents are unknown. 
Renal insufficiency 
Patients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated 
with consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with zoledronic acid 
outweighs the possible risk.  
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2–3 months.  
Zoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. Factors that may increase the 
potential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, 
multiple cycles of zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic 
medicinal products. While the risk is reduced with a dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over 
15 minutes, deterioration in renal function may still occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal 
failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg 
zoledronic acid. Increases in serum creatinine also occur in some patients with chronic administration 
of zoledronic acid at recommended doses for prevention of skeletal related events, although less 
frequently.  
Patients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of zoledronic acid. Upon 
initiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, lower 
doses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal deterioration 
during treatment, zoledronic acid should be withheld. Zoledronic acid should only be resumed when 
serum creatinine returns to within 10% of baseline. Zoledronic acid treatment should be resumed at the 
same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. 
In view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in 
patients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine  400 µmol/l or 
4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and  265 µmol/l or  3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and bone 
metastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe 
renal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of zoledronic acid is not 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.  
Hepatic insufficiency 
As only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific 
recommendations can be given for this patient population.  
Osteonecrosis 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials in patients receiving 
Zoledronic Acid. Post-marketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of 
ONJ based on tumour type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma). A study showed that ONJ 
was higher in myeloma patients when compared to other cancers (see section 5.1). 
The start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed 
open soft tissue lesions in the mouth, except in medical emergency situations. A dental examination 
with appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors.  
The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual’s risk of developing 
ONJ: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of 
administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of 
bisphosphonate. 
Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. 
Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy to 
neck and head, corticosteroids. 
History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures 
(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures 
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with zoledronic acid. While on treatment, invasive dental 
procedures should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to 
zoledronic acid administration. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on 
bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental 
procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment 
reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.  
The management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between 
the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of 
zoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk 
factors are mitigated where possible. 
Osteonecrosis of other anatomical sites 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in 
association with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory 
canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The 
possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving 
bisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. 
Additionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and 
femur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira. 
Musculoskeletal pain 
In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain 
have been reported in patients taking zoledronic acid. However, such reports have been infrequent. 
The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment. Most 
patients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when 
rechallenged with zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate.  
Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate 
therapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short 
oblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just 
above the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients 
experience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to 
months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the 
contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a 
femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered 
pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment.  
During bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and 
any patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. 
Hypocalcaemia 
Hypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Cardiac arrhythmias and 
neurologic adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported 
secondary to cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation 
have been reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8). 
Caution is advised when Zoledronic acid is administered with medicinal products known to cause 
hypocalcaemia, as they may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section 
4.5). Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating 
zoledronic acid therapy. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit. Patients on low 
sodium diets can be informed that this medicinal product is essentially “sodium-free”. 
This medicinal product may be diluted with sodium-containing solutions (see section 4.2) and this 
should be considered in relation to the total sodium from all sources that will be administered to the 
patient. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In clinical studies, zoledronic acid has been administered concomitantly with commonly used 
anticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions 
occurring. Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit 
human P450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been 
performed.  
Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop 
diuretics, since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for 
longer periods than required (see section 4.4).  
Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal 
products. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during 
treatment.  
In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when zoledronic acid is 
used in combination with thalidomide. 
Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Hospira is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal 
products, as an increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly 
with these medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction 
studies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
humans is unknown. Zoledronic acid should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing 
potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zoledronic acid is 
contraindicated in breast-feeding women (see section 4.3).  
Fertility 
Zoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 
generation. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the 
compound's inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a 
bisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded 
determining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use 
machines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of zoledronic acid along with driving and 
operating of machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Within three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has commonly been 
reported, with symptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis 
with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days (see description of 
selected adverse reactions).  
The following are the important identified risks with zoledronic acid in the approved indications:  
Renal function impairment, osteonecrosis of the jaw, acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia, atrial 
fibrillation, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease. The frequencies for each of these identified risks are 
shown in Table 1.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Renal function impairment 
Zoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety 
data from trials for the use of zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients 
with advanced malignancies involving bone, the frequency of renal impairment adverse events 
suspected to be related to zoledronic acid (adverse reactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma 
(3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that 
may increase the potential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal 
impairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant use of 
nephrotoxic medicinal products or using a shorter infusion time than currently recommended. Renal 
deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial 
dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid (see section 4.4).  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with 
medicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). Many of 
these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection 
including osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions 
or other dental surgeries.  
Atrial fibrillation  
In one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
zoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), 
the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in 
patients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious 
adverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic 
acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been observed in 
other trials with zoledronic acid, including those with zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3-4 weeks in 
oncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this single 
clinical trial is unknown.  
Acute phase reaction 
This adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, 
headache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint 
10 
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
swelling. The onset time is  3 days post-zoledronic acid infusion, and the reaction is also referred to 
using the terms “flu-like” or “post-dose” symptoms.  
Atypical fractures of the femur 
During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare): 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphosphonate class adverse reaction). 
Hypocalcaemia-related ADRs 
Hypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with zoledronic acid in the approved indications. Based 
on the review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an 
association between zoledronic acid therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary 
development of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between 
hypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, 
hypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Clinical experience with acute overdose of zoledronic acid is limited. The administration of doses up 
to 48 mg of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than 
those recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment 
(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) 
abnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should 
be administered as clinically indicated. 
5  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC 
code: M05BA08  
Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of 
osteoclastic bone resorption.  
The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, 
but the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In 
long-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the 
formation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone.  
In addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several anti-
tumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone 
disease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies:  
- 
In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone marrow 
microenvironment, making it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic activity and 
anti-pain activity.  
11 
- 
In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on 
tumour cells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer medicinal products, anti-
adhesion/invasion activity.  
Clinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone 
The first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to 
placebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic 
acid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related 
event (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of 
events per patient - skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36% risk reduction in 
developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving 
zoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference 
reached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered 
pathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. 
Efficacy results are provided in Table 2.  
In a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg 
significantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by 
> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7% risk 
reduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Efficacy 
results are provided in Table 3.

In a third phase III randomised, double-blind trial, zoledronic acid 4 mg or 90 mg pamidronate every 3 
to 4 weeks were compared in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer with at least one bone 
lesion. The results demonstrated that zoledronic acid 4 mg showed comparable efficacy to 90 mg 
pamidronate in the prevention of SREs. The multiple event analysis revealed a significant risk 
reduction of 16% in patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg in comparison with patients receiving 
pamidronate. Efficacy results are provided in Table 4.

Zoledronic acid 4 mg was also studied in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 228 
patients with documented bone metastases from breast cancer to evaluate the effect of 4 mg zoledronic 
acid on the skeletal related event (SRE) rate ratio, calculated as the total number of SRE events 
(excluding hypercalcaemia and adjusted for prior fracture), divided by the total risk period. Patients 
received either 4 mg zoledronic acid or placebo every four weeks for one year. Patients were evenly 
distributed between zoledronic acid-treated and placebo groups.  
The SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The 
proportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8% in the zoledronic 
acid -treated group versus 49.6% in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first 
SRE was not reached in the zoledronic acid -treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly 
prolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in a 
multiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo.  
In the zoledronic acid-treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the 
Brief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, 
when compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below 
baseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score.

Time on study (weeks) 
The primary objective of this observational study was to estimate the cumulative incidence of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) at 3 years in cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic 
acid. The osteoclast inhibition therapy, other cancer therapy, and dental care was performed as 
clinically indicated in order to best represent academic and community-based care. A baseline dental 
examination was recommended but was not mandatory. 
Among the 3491 evaluable patients, 87 cases of ONJ diagnosis were confirmed. The overall estimated 
cumulative incidence of confirmed ONJ at 3 years was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3-3.5%). The rates were 0.8% 
at year 1 and 2.0% at year 2. Rates of 3-year confirmed ONJ were highest in myeloma patients (4.3%) 
and lowest in breast cancer patients (2.4%). Cases of confirmed ONJ were statistically significantly 
higher in patients with multiple myeloma (p=0.03) than other cancers combined. 
Clinical trial results in the treatment of TIH 
Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic 
acid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In Phase I dose 
finding studies in patients with mild to moderate tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), effective 
doses tested were in the range of approximately 1.2–2.5 mg.  
To assess the effects of 4 mg zoledronic acid versus pamidronate 90 mg, the results of two pivotal 
multicentre studies in patients with TIH were combined in a pre-planned analysis. There was faster 
normalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and 
8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed:

Median time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected 
serum calcium  2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus 
17 days for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg 
zoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid 
doses.  
In clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, 
8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these 
patients was about 52%. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data 
available allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose.  
In clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety 
profile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was 
similar in types and severity.  
Paediatric population 
Clinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to 
17 years 
The effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) 
with severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in 
one international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment 
group, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening 
period during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In 
the clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a 
maximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg 
zoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was 
conducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly 
zoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year 
of treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study.  
The primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral 
density (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but 
the trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In 
particular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse 
events of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24% (femur) and 14% 
(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients vs 12% and 5% of pamidronate-treated patients with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of fractures was 
comparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43% (32/74) vs 41% (31/76). 
Interpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are common events in 
patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process.  
16 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in 
adults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked 
under headings of frequency, are presented in Table 6. The following conventional classification is 
used: very common ( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to <1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to <1/100), rare 
( 1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data).

1 Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5% were medically assessed and it was shown that 
these cases are consistent with the well established safety profile of zoledronic acid (see section 4.8)  
In paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with 
more pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in 
comparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions.  
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
reference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in 
the treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients 
with advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Single and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients 
with bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose 
independent.  
17 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
After initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly 
increased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% 
of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low 
concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day 28.  
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic 
disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by 
a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours. There was no 
accumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is 
not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the 
administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. 
From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via 
the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, 
age, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease 
in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curve.  
The interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with 
other bisphosphonates.  
No pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in 
patients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, 
shows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the 
faeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid.  
The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance 
representing 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/min (range 22 
to 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with 
creatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the 
corresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a 
patient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min).  
In an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, 
with a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to 
5000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at 
2 ng/ml to 77% at 2000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid. 
Special populations 
Paediatric patients 
Limited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic 
acid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg 
dose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic 
acid systemic exposure. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute toxicity 
The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in 
rats.  
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subchronic and chronic toxicity  
Zoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to 
dogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously 
in rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2–3 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well 
tolerated.  
The most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the 
metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the 
compound's pharmacological antiresorptive activity.  
The safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal 
studies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and 
multiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06–0.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses 
equivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat 
administration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid 
produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and 
lungs, and at intravenous injection sites.  
Reproduction toxicity 
Zoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses  0.2 mg/kg. Although no 
teratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was 
observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat.  
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential  
Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did 
not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.

4  CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
- 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone.  
- 
Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Zoledronic acid must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare professionals 
experienced in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients treated with zoledronic 
acid should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. 
Posology 
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone 
Adults and elderly 
The recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks.  
Patients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D 
daily.  
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months.

Treatment of TIH 
Adults and elderly 
The recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium ≥ 12.0 mg/dl or 
3.0 mmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid.  
Renal impairment 
TIH: 
Zoledronic acid treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be considered 
only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum 
creatinine > 400 µmol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is necessary in TIH 
patients with serum creatinine < 400 µmol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4).  
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone: 
When initiating treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone 
lesions from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. 
CLcr is calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Zoledronic acid is not 
recommended for patients presenting with severe renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which 
is defined for this population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials with zoledronic acid, patients with 
serum creatinine > 265 µmol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded.  
For patients with normal renal function (defined as CLcr > 60 ml/min), zoledronic acid 4 mg/100 ml 
solution for infusion may be administered directly without any further preparation. In patients with 
bone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, 
which is defined for this population as CLcr 30–60 ml/min, reduced Zoledronic Acid Hospira doses 
are recommended (see also section 4.4).

reduced doses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in 
patients with creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. 
Following initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of Zoledronic 
Acid Hospira and treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, 
renal deterioration was defined as follows:  
- 
- 
For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 µmol/l), an increase of 
0.5 mg/dl or 44 µmol/l;  
For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 µmol/l), an increase of 1.0 
mg/dl or 88 µmol/l.  
In the clinical studies, zoledronic acid treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned 
to within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zoledronic Acid Hospira treatment should be 
resumed at the same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been 
established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made.  
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira solution for infusion should be given as a single intravenous infusion in no 
less than 15 minutes. 
In patients with normal renal function, defined as CLcr > 60 ml/min, zoledronic acid 4 mg/100 ml 
solution for infusion must not be further diluted.  
In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced Zoledronic Acid Hospira doses are 
recommended (see section “Posology” above and section 4.4). 
To prepare reduced doses for patients with baseline CLcr ≤ 60 ml/min, refer to Table 1 below. 
Remove the volume of Zoledronic Acid Hospira solution indicated from the bag prior to 
administration.

Patients must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1  
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Patients must be assessed prior to administration of zoledronic acid to ensure that they are adequately 
hydrated.  
Overhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure.  
Standard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate 
and magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating zoledronic acid therapy. If 
24 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy 
may be necessary. Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function 
impairment, therefore careful renal function monitoring should be considered.  
Other products containing zoledronic acid as active substance are available for osteoporosis 
indications and treatment of Paget´s disease of the bone. Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira should not be treated with zoledronic acid or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, since 
the combined effects of these agents are unknown. 
Renal insufficiency 
Patients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated 
with consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with zoledronic acid 
outweighs the possible risk.  
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2–3 months.  
Zoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. Factors that may increase the 
potential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, 
multiple cycles of zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic 
medicinal products. While the risk is reduced with a dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over 
15 minutes, deterioration in renal function may still occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal 
failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg 
zoledronic acid. Increases in serum creatinine also occur in some patients with chronic administration 
of zoledronic acid at recommended doses for prevention of skeletal related events, although less 
frequently.  
Patients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of zoledronic acid. Upon 
initiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, lower 
doses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal deterioration 
during treatment, zoledronic acid should be withheld. Zoledronic acid should only be resumed when 
serum creatinine returns to within 10% of baseline. Zoledronic acid treatment should be resumed at the 
same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption.  
In view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in 
patients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine  400 µmol/l or 
4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and  265 µmol/l or  3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and bone 
metastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe 
renal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of zoledronic acid is not 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.  
Hepatic insufficiency 
As only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific 
recommendations can be given for this patient population.  
Osteonecrosis  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials in patients receiving 
zoledronic acid. Post-marketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of 
ONJ based on tumour type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma). A study showed that ONJ 
was higher in myeloma patients when compared to other cancers (see section 5.1) 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed 
open soft tissue lesions in the mouth, except in medical emergency situations. A dental examination 
with appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior 
to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors. 
The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual’s risk of developing 
ONJ: 
- 
Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of 
administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of 
bisphosphonate. 
Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. 
Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy to 
neck and head, corticosteroids. 
History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures 
(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures. 
- 
- 
- 
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with zoledronic acid. 
While on treatment, invasive dental procedures should be performed only after careful consideration 
and be avoided in close proximity to zoledronic acid administration. For patients who develop 
osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the 
condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether 
discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. The 
management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between the 
treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of 
zoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk 
factors are mitigated where possible.  
Osteonecrosis of other anatomical sites 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in 
association with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory 
canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The 
possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving 
bisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. 
Additionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and 
femur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira. 
Musculoskeletal pain 
In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain 
have been reported in patients taking zoledronic acid. However, such reports have been infrequent. 
The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment. Most 
patients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when 
rechallenged with zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate.  
Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate 
therapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short 
oblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just 
above the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients 
experience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to 
months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a 
femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of 
bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered 
pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment.  
During bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and 
any patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. 
Hypocalcaemia 
Hypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Cardiac arrhythmias and 
neurologic adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported 
secondary to cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation 
have been reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8). 
Caution is advised when zoledronic acid is administered with medicinal products known to cause 
hypocalcaemia, as they may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section 
4.5). Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating 
zoledronic acid therapy. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 360 mg sodium per dosage unit, equivalent to18% of the WHO 
maximum recommended daily intake (RDI) of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In clinical studies, zoledronic acid has been administered concomitantly with commonly used 
anticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions 
occurring. Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit 
human P450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been 
performed.  
Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop 
diuretics, since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for 
longer periods than required (see section 4.4).  
Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal 
products. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during 
treatment.  
In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when zoledronic acid is 
used in combination with thalidomide. 
Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Hospira is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal 
products, as an increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly 
with these medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction 
studies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for 
humans is unknown. Zoledronic acid should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing 
potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. 
Breast-feeding 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zoledronic acid is 
contraindicated in breast-feeding women (see section 4.3).  
Fertility 
Zoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 
generation. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the 
compound's inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a 
bisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded 
determining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use 
machines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of zoledronic acid along with driving and 
operating of machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Within three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has commonly been 
reported, with symptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis 
with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days (see description of 
selected adverse reactions).  
The following are the important identified risks with zoledronic acid in the approved indications:  
Renal function impairment, osteonecrosis of the jaw, acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia, atrial 
fibrillation, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease. The frequencies for each of these identified risks are 
shown in Table 2.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Renal function impairment 
Zoledronic acid has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety 
data from trials for the use of zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients 
with advanced malignancies involving bone, the frequency of renal impairment adverse events 
suspected to be related to zoledronic acid (adverse reactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma 
(3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that 
may increase the potential for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal 
impairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant use of 
nephrotoxic medicinal products or using a shorter infusion time than currently recommended. Renal 
deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial 
dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid (see section 4.4).  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw  
Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with 
medicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). Many of 
these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection 
including osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions 
or other dental surgeries.  
Atrial fibrillation  
In one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
zoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), 
the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in 
patients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious 
adverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic 
acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been observed in 
other trials with zoledronic acid, including those with zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3-4 weeks in 
oncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this single 
clinical trial is unknown.  
Acute phase reaction 
This adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, 
headache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint 
swelling. The onset time is  3 days post-zoledronic acid infusion, and the reaction is also referred to 
using the terms “flu-like” or “post-dose” symptoms.  
30 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare): 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphosphonate class adverse reaction). 
Hypocalcaemia-related ADRs 
Hypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with zoledronic acid in the approved indications. Based 
on the review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an 
association between zoledronic acid therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary 
development of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between 
hypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, 
hypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Clinical experience with acute overdose of zoledronic acid is limited. The administration of doses up 
to 48 mg of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than 
those recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment 
(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) 
abnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should 
be administered as clinically indicated. 
5  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC 
code: M05BA08  
Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of 
osteoclastic bone resorption.  
The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, 
but the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In 
long-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the 
formation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone.  
In addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several anti-
tumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone 
disease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies:  
- 
In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone marrow 
microenvironment, making it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic activity and 
anti-pain activity.  
31 
- 
In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on 
tumour cells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer medicinal products, anti-
adhesion/invasion activity.  
Clinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone 
The first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to 
placebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic 
acid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related 
event (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of 
events per patient - skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36% risk reduction in 
developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving 
zoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference 
reached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered 
pathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. 
Efficacy results are provided in Table 3.  
In a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg 
significantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by 
> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7% risk 
reduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Efficacy 
results are provided in Table 4.

In a third phase III randomised, double-blind trial, zoledronic acid 4 mg or 90 mg pamidronate every 3 
to 4 weeks were compared in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer with at least one bone 
lesion. The results demonstrated that zoledronic acid 4 mg showed comparable efficacy to 90 mg 
pamidronate in the prevention of SREs. The multiple event analysis revealed a significant risk 
reduction of 16% in patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg in comparison with patients receiving 
pamidronate. Efficacy results are provided in Table 5.

Zoledronic acid 4 mg was also studied in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 228 
patients with documented bone metastases from breast cancer to evaluate the effect of 4 mg zoledronic 
acid on the skeletal related event (SRE) rate ratio, calculated as the total number of SRE events 
(excluding hypercalcaemia and adjusted for prior fracture), divided by the total risk period. Patients 
received either 4 mg zoledronic acid or placebo every four weeks for one year. Patients were evenly 
distributed between zoledronic acid -treated and placebo groups.  
The SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The 
proportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8% in the zoledronic 
acid-treated group versus 49.6% in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first SRE 
was not reached in the zoledronic acid-treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly 
prolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in a 
multiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo.  
In the zoledronic acid-treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the 
Brief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, 
when compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below 
baseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score.

CZOL446EUS122/SWOG study 
The primary objective of this observational study was to estimate the cumulative incidence of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) at 3 years in cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic 
acid. The osteoclast inhibition therapy, other cancer therapy, and dental care was performed as 
clinically indicated in order to best represent academic and community-based care. A baseline dental 
examination was recommended but was not mandatory. 
Among the 3491 evaluable patients, 87 cases of ONJ diagnosis were confirmed. The overall estimated 
cumulative incidence of confirmed ONJ at 3 years was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3-3.5%). The rates were 0.8% 
at year 1 and 2.0% at year 2. Rates of 3-year confirmed ONJ were highest in myeloma patients (4.3%) 
and lowest in breast cancer patients (2.4%). Cases of confirmed ONJ were statistically significantly 
higher in patients with multiple myeloma (p=0.03) than other cancers combined. 
Clinical trial results in the treatment of TIH 
Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic 
acid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In Phase I dose 
finding studies in patients with mild to moderate tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), effective 
doses tested were in the range of approximately 1.2–2.5 mg.  
To assess the effects of 4 mg zoledronic acid versus pamidronate 90 mg, the results of two pivotal 
multicentre studies in patients with TIH were combined in a pre-planned analysis. There was faster 
normalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and 
8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed:

Median time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected 
serum calcium  2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus 17 
days for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg 
zoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid 
doses.  
In clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, 
8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these 
patients was about 52%. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data 
available allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose.  
In clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety 
profile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was 
similar in types and severity.  
Paediatric population 
Clinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to 
17 years 
The effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) 
with severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in 
one international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment 
group, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening 
period during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In 
the clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a 
maximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg 
zoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was 
conducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly 
zoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year 
of treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study.  
The primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral 
density (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but 
the trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In 
particular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse 
events of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24% (femur) and 14% 
(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients vs 12% and 5% of pamidronate-treated patients with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of fractures was 
comparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43% (32/74) vs 41% (31/76). 
Interpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are common events in 
patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process.  
36 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in 
adults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked 
under headings of frequency, are presented in Table 7. The following conventional classification is 
used: very common ( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to <1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to <1/100), rare 
( 1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data).

1 Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5% were medically assessed and it was shown that 
these cases are consistent with the well established safety profile of zoledronic acid (see section 4.8)  
In paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with 
more pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in 
comparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions.  
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
reference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in 
the treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients 
with advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Single and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients 
with bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose 
independent.  
37 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
After initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly 
increased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% 
of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low 
concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day 28.  
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic 
disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by 
a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours. There was no 
accumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is 
not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the 
administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. 
From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via 
the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, 
age, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease 
in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curve.  
The interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with 
other bisphosphonates.  
No pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in 
patients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, 
shows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the 
faeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid.  
The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance 
representing 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/min (range 22 
to 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with 
creatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the 
corresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a 
patient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min).  
In an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, 
with a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to 
5000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at 
2 ng/ml to 77% at 2000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid. 
Special populations 
Paediatric patients 
Limited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic 
acid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg 
dose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic 
acid systemic exposure. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute toxicity 
The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in 
rats.  
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subchronic and chronic toxicity  
Zoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to 
dogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously 
in rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2–3 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well 
tolerated.  
The most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the 
metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the 
compound's pharmacological antiresorptive activity.  
The safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal 
studies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and 
multiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06–0.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses 
equivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat 
administration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid 
produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and 
lungs, and at intravenous injection sites.  
Reproduction toxicity 
Zoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses  0.2 mg/kg. Although no 
teratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was 
observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat.  
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential  
Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did 
not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.

Clear and colourless solution. 
4  CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of Paget's disease of the bone in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Hospira. This is 
especially important for the elderly (≥65 years) and for patients receiving diuretic therapy. 
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira administration. 
For the treatment of Paget's disease, zoledronic acid should be prescribed only by physicians with 
experience in the treatment of Paget's disease of the bone. The recommended dose is a single 
intravenous infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid. In patients with Paget’s disease, it is strongly advised 
that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is 
ensured for at least 10 days following Zoledronic Acid Hospira administration (see section 4.4). 
Re-treatment of Paget's disease: After initial treatment with zoledronic acid in Paget's disease, an 
extended remission period is observed in responding patients. Re-treatment consists of an additional 
intravenous infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid after an interval of one year or longer from initial 
treatment in patients who have relapsed. Limited data on re-treatment of Paget’s disease are available 
(see section 5.1).  
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Zoledronic acid is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4).  
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance  35 ml/min.  
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).  
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
No dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability, distribution and elimination were similar in 
elderly patients and younger subjects.  
Paediatric population 
Zoledronic acid Hospira should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. There 
are no data available for children under 5 years of age. Currently available data for children aged 5 to 
17 years are described in section 5.1.  
Method of administration 
Intravenous use.  
Zoledronic Acid Hospira (5 mg in 100 ml ready-to-infuse solution) is administered via a vented 
infusion line and given slowly at a constant infusion rate. The infusion time must not be less than 15 
minutes. For information on the infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira, see section 6.6. 
Patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira should be given the package leaflet and the patient 
reminder card. 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1.  
Patients with hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4).  
Severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Renal function 
The use of Zoledronic Acid Hospira in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 
35 ml/min) is contraindicated due to an increased risk of renal failure in this population. 
Renal impairment has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid (see section 4.8), 
especially in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or other risks including advanced age, 
concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy (see section 4.5), or 
dehydration occurring after zoledronic acid administration. Renal impairment has been observed in 
patients after a single administration. Renal failure requiring dialysis or with a fatal outcome has rarely 
occurred in patients with underlying renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described above.  
The following precautions should be taken into account to minimise the risk of renal adverse 
reactions:

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using the Cockcroft-
Gault formula before each Zoledronic Acid Hospira dose. 
Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with underlying impaired renal 
function.  
Monitoring of serum creatinine should be considered in at-risk patients.  
Zoledronic acid should be used with caution when concomitantly used with other medicinal 
products that could impact renal function (see section 4.5).  
Patients, especially elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy, should be appropriately 
hydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid.  
A single dose of zoledronic acid should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be 
at least 15 minutes (see section 4.2).  
Hypocalcaemia 
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before 
initiating therapy with zoledronic acid (see section 4.3). Other disturbances of mineral metabolism 
must also be effectively treated (e.g. diminished parathyroid reserve, intestinal calcium 
malabsorption). Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients.  
Elevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget's disease of the bone. Due to the rapid onset of 
effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover, transient hypocalcaemia, sometimes symptomatic, may 
develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of zoledronic acid (see section 
4.8).  
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with zoledronic acid 
administration. In addition, in patients with Paget's disease, it is strongly advised that adequate 
supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at 
least 10 days following zoledronic acid administration (see section 4.2).  
Patients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical 
monitoring during the period of risk. Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of zoledronic 
acid is recommended for patients with Paget´s disease.  
Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported 
in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.8).  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)  
ONJ has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving zoledronic acid for 
osteoporosis (see section 4.8). 
The start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed 
open soft tissue lesions in the mouth. A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual 
benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior to treatment with Zoledronic Acid Hospira in patients 
with concomitant risk factors. 
The following should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ: 
- 
- 
Potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent 
compounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative 
dose of bone resorption therapy. 
Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to 
head and neck. 
Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, 
invasive dental procedures, e.g. tooth extractions. 
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with zoledronic acid. While on treatment, invasive dental 
procedures should be performed with caution and avoided in close proximity to zoledronic acid 
treatment. 
The management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between 
the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of 
zoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk 
factors are mitigated where possible.  
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in 
association with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory 
canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The 
possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving 
bisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate 
therapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short 
oblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just 
above the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients 
experience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to 
months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the 
contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a 
femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of 
bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered 
pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment.  
During bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and 
any patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. 
Acute phase reactions 
Acute phase reactions (APRs) or post-dose symptoms such as fever, myalgia, flu-like symptoms, 
arthralgia and headache have been observed, the majority of which occurred within three days 
following Zoledronic Acid Hospira administration. 
APRs may sometimes be serious or prolonged in duration. The incidence of post-dose symptoms can 
be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira administration. It is also advisable to postpone treatment if the patient is clinically unstable 
due to an acute medical condition and an APR could be problematic (see section 4.8). 
General 
Other products containing zoledronic acid as an active substance are available for oncology 
indications. Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira should not be treated with such 
products or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, since the combined effects of these agents are 
unknown.

Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit. Patients on low 
sodium diets can be informed that this medicinal product is essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed. Zoledronic acid is not 
systemically metabolised and does not affect human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro (see section 
5.2). Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 43-55% bound) and 
interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound medicinal products are therefore 
unlikely.  
Zoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion. Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid is 
administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e.g. 
aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration) (see section 4.4).  
In patients with renal impairment, the systemic exposure to concomitant medicinal products that are 
primarily excreted via the kidney may increase. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Zoledronic acid is not recommended in women of childbearing potential.  
Pregnancy 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). There are no adequate 
data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in animals with zoledronic acid have 
shown reproductive toxicological effects including malformations (see section 5.3). The potential risk 
for humans is unknown.  
Breast-feeding 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). It is unknown 
whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk.  
Fertility 
Zoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 
generation. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered related to the compound's 
inhibition of skeletal calcium mobilisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a 
bisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded 
determining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Adverse reactions, such as dizziness, may affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Atrial fibrillation 
In the HORIZON - Pivotal Fracture Trial [PFT] (see section 5.1), the overall incidence of atrial 
fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic 
47 
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
acid and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in 
patients receiving zoledronic acid (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared with patients receiving placebo 
(0.6%) (22 out of 3,852). The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is 
unknown. In the osteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the pooled 
atrial fibrillation incidences were comparable between zoledronic acid (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%). For 
atrial fibrillation serious adverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3% for zoledronic acid and 0.8% 
for placebo.  
Class effects 
Renal impairment 
Zoledronic acid has been associated with renal impairment manifested as deterioration in renal 
function (i.e. increased serum creatinine) and in rare cases acute renal failure. Renal impairment has 
been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing 
renal dysfunction or additional risk factors (e.g., advanced age, oncology patients with chemotherapy, 
concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy, severe dehydration), with 
the majority of them receiving a 4 mg dose every 3-4 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after 
a single administration.  
In clinical trials in osteoporosis, the change in creatinine clearance (measured annually prior to dosing) 
and the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the zoledronic acid and 
placebo treatment groups over three years. There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed 
within 10 days in 1.8% of zoledronic acid-treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients.  
Hypocalcaemia 
In clinical trials in osteoporosis, approximately 0.2% of patients had notable declines of serum calcium 
levels (less than 1.87 mmol/l) following zoledronic acid administration. No symptomatic cases of 
hypocalcaemia were observed.  
In the Paget's disease trials, symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1% of 
patients, in all of whom it resolved.  
Based on laboratory assessment, transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference 
range (less than 2.10 mmol/l) occurred in 2.3% of zoledronic acid-treated patients in a large clinical 
trial compared to 21% of zoledronic acid-treated patients in the Paget's disease trials. The frequency of 
hypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions.  
All patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal 
osteoporosis trial, the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial, and the Paget's disease 
trials (see also section 4.2). In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip 
fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading 
dose of vitamin D prior to zoledronic acid administration (see section 4.2).  
Local reactions 
In a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and/or pain, were 
reported (0.7%) following the administration of zoledronic acid.  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with 
medicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). In a large 
clinical trial in 7,736 patients, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with 
zoledronic acid and one patient treated with placebo. Cases of ONJ have been reported in the post-
marketing setting for zoledronic acid.

Acute phase reactions 
The overall percentage of patients who reported acute phase reactions or post-dose symptoms 
(including serious cases) after zoledronic acid administration is as follows (frequencies derived from 
the study in treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis): fever (18.1%), myalgia (9.4%), flu-like 
symptoms (7.8%), arthralgia (6.8%) and headache (6.5%), the majority of which occurred within the 
first 3 days following zoledronic acid administration. The majority of these symptoms were mild to 
moderate in nature and resolved within 3 days of the event onset. The incidence of these symptoms 
decreased with subsequent annual doses of zoledronic acid. The percentage of patients who 
experienced adverse reactions was lower in a smaller study (19.5%, 10.4%, 10.7% after the first, 
second and third infusion, respectively), where prophylaxis against adverse reactions was used (see 
section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Clinical experience with acute overdose is limited. Patients who have received doses higher than those 
recommended should be carefully monitored. In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant 
hypocalcaemia, reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/or an intravenous 
infusion of calcium gluconate. 
5  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC 
code: M05BA08  
Mechanism of action 
Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on 
bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone. 
The main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate 
synthase. The long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity for 
the active site of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase and its strong binding affinity to bone 
mineral.  
Zoledronic acid treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone turnover from elevated post-menopausal 
levels with the nadir for resorption markers observed at 7 days, and for formation markers at 12 
weeks. Thereafter bone markers stabilised within the pre-menopausal range. There was no progressive 
reduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing. 
49 
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget's disease of the bone 
Zoledronic acid was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to 
moderate Paget's disease of the bone (median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6–3.0 times the 
upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry) confirmed by 
radiographic evidence. 
The efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for 2 
months was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials. After 6 months, zoledronic acid showed 
96% (169/176) and 89% (156/176) response and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) normalisation 
rates compared to 74% (127/171) and 58% (99/171) for risedronate (all p<0.001).  
In the pooled results, a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to 
baseline were observed over 6 months for zoledronic acid and risedronate.  
Patients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter 
an extended follow-up period. Of the 153 zoledronic acid-treated patients and 115 risedronate-treated 
patients who entered an extended observation study, after a mean duration of follow-up of 3.8 years 
from time of dosing, the proportion of patients ending the Extended Observation Period due to the 
need for re-treatment (clinical judgment) was higher for risedronate (48 patients, or 41.7%) compared 
with zoledronic acid (11 patients, or 7.2%). The mean time of ending the Extended Observation Period 
due to the need for Paget’s re-treatment from the initial dose was longer for zoledronic acid (7.7 years) 
than for risedronate (5.1 years).  
Six patients who achieved therapeutic response 6 months after treatment with zoledronic acid and later 
experienced disease relapse during the extended follow-up period were re-treated with zoledronic acid 
after a mean time of 6.5 years from initial treatment to re-treatment. Five of the 6 patients had SAP 
within the normal range at month 6 (Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF). 
Bone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget's disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg 
zoledronic acid. Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired 
bone remodelling and no evidence of mineralisation defects. These results were consistent with 
biochemical marker evidence of normalisation of bone turnover.  
Paediatric population  
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in paediatric patients aged 5 to 
17 years treated with glucocorticoids who had decreased bone mineral density (lumbar spine BMD Z-
score of -0.5 or less) and a low impact/fragility fracture. The patient population randomised in this 
study (ITT population) included patients with several sub-types of rheumatic conditions, inflammatory 
bowel disease, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The study was planned to include 92 patients, 
however only 34 patients were enrolled and randomised to receive either a twice-yearly 0.05 mg/kg 
(max. 5 mg) intravenous zoledronic acid infusion or placebo for one year. All patients were required to 
receive background therapy of vitamin D and calcium.  
Zoledronic acid infusion resulted in an increase in the lumbar spine BMD Z-score least square (LS) 
mean difference of 0.41 at month 12 relative to baseline compared to placebo (95% CI: 0.02, 0.81; 18 
and 16 patients, respectively). No effect on lumbar spine BMD Z-score was evident after 6 months of 
treatment. At month 12, a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in three bone turnover markers 
(P1NP, BSAP, NTX) was observed in the zoledronic acid group as compared to the placebo group. No 
statistically significant differences in total body bone mineral content were observed between patients 
treated with zoledronic acid versus placebo at 6 or 12 months. There is no clear evidence establishing 
a link between BMD changes and fracture prevention in children with growing skeletons.  
No new vertebral fractures were observed in the zoledronic acid group as compared to two new 
fractures in the placebo group.  
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions after infusion of zoledronic acid were arthralgia 
(28%), pyrexia (22%), vomiting (22%), headache (22%), nausea (17%), myalgia (17%), pain (17%), 
diarrhoea (11%) and hypocalcaemia (11%).  
More patients reported serious adverse events in the zoledronic acid group than in the placebo group 
(5 [27.8%] patients versus 1 [6.3%] patient).  
In the 12-month open-label extension of the above-mentioned core study, no new clinical fractures 
were observed. However 2 patients, one in each of the core study treatment groups (zoledronic acid 
group: 1/9, 11.1% and placebo group: 1/14, 7.1%), had new morphometric vertebral fractures. There 
were no new safety findings. 
Long-term safety data in this population cannot be established from these studies. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
reference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in 
Paget's disease of the bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Single and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients 
yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose independent.  
Distribution 
After initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased 
rapidly, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% of 
peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low 
concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak levels.  
Elimination 
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic 
disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by 
a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours. There was no 
accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. The early 
disposition phases (α and β, with t½ values above) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and 
excretion via the kidneys.  
Zoledronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 
39 ± 16% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound 
to bone tissue. This uptake into bone is common for all bisphosphonates and is presumably a 
consequence of the structural analogy to pyrophosphate. As with other bisphosphonates, the retention 
time of zoledronic acid in bones is very long. From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into 
the systemic circulation and eliminated via the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/h, 
independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight. The inter- and intra-subject 
variation for plasma clearance of zoledronic acid was shown to be 36% and 34%, respectively. 
Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease in zoledronic acid 
concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration 
versus time curve.  
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships 
No interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed with zoledronic acid. Since 
zoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity 
as a direct-acting and/or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes, zoledronic 
acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cytochrome P450 enzyme systems. Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins 
(approximately 43-55% bound) and binding is concentration independent. Therefore, interactions 
resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound medicinal products are unlikely.  
Special populations (see section 4.2) 
Renal impairment 
The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance 
representing 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/min (range 22 
to 143 ml/min) in the 64 patients studied. Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr), by about 30% to 
40% in mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to a patient with normal renal function, and lack 
of accumulation of medicinal product with multiple doses irrespective of renal function, suggest that 
dose adjustments of zoledronic acid in mild (Clcr = 50–80 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment 
down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/min are not necessary. The use of zoledronic acid in patients 
with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 ml/min) is contraindicated due to an increased 
risk of renal failure in this population. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute toxicity 
The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in 
rats. In the single-dose dog infusion studies, 1.0 mg/kg (6 fold the recommended human therapeutic 
exposure based on AUC) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects.  
Subchronic and chronic toxicity  
In the intravenous infusion studies, renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when 
given 0.6 mg/kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals, six times in total (for a cumulative dose that 
corresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure) while five 15-minute 
infusions of 0.25 mg/kg administered at 2-3-week intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponded to 7 
times the human therapeutic exposure) were well tolerated in dogs. In the intravenous bolus studies, 
the doses that were well tolerated decreased with increasing study duration: 0.2 and 0.02 mg/kg daily 
was well tolerated for 4 weeks in rats and dogs, respectively but only 0.01 mg/kg and 0.005 mg/kg in 
rats and dogs, respectively, when given for 52 weeks.  
Longer-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum 
intended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal 
tract and liver, and at the site of intravenous administration. The clinical relevance of these findings is 
unknown. The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary 
spongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that 
reflected the compound's pharmacological antiresorptive activity.  
Reproduction toxicity 
Teratology studies were performed in two species, both via subcutaneous administration. 
Teratogenicity was observed in rats at doses  0.2 mg/kg and was manifested by external, visceral and 
skeletal malformations. Dystocia was observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg body weight) tested in 
rats. No teratological or embryo/foetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was 
marked at 0.1 mg/kg due to decreased serum calcium levels.  
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential  
Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did 
not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1  What Zoledronic Acid Hospira is and what it is used for 
The active substance in Zoledronic Acid Hospira is zoledronic acid, which belongs to a group of 
substances called bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing 
down the rate of bone change. It is used: 
• 
To prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread 
of cancer from primary site to the bone). 
To reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the 
presence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the 
release of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
• 
2  What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira  
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zoledronic Acid Hospira and 
will check your response to treatment at regular intervals. 
You should not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira: 
- 
- 
if you are breast-feeding. 
if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which 
zoledronic acid belongs), or any of the other ingredients of Zoledronic Acid Hospira (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira: 
- 
- 
if you have or have had a kidney problem. 
if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the 
jaw or loosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start 
treatment with Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are 
being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira and inform your doctor about your dental treatment. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including 
regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. 
Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a 
condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are 
undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are 
smokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Reduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry 
skin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Irregular heart 
beat (cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to 
severe hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these 
apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be 
corrected before initiating the first dose of Zoledronic Acid Hospira. You will be given adequate 
calcium and vitamin D supplements. 
Patients aged 65 years and over 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to 
suggest that any extra precautions are needed. 
Children and adolescents 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 18 
years. 
Other medicines and Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
Tell your doctor  if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is 
especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: 
- 
Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used 
to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to 
treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the 
combination of these 
with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become too low. 
Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any 
other medicines which may harm your kidneys. 
Any other medicines that also contains zoledronic acid and is used to treat osteoporosis and 
other non-cancer diseases of the bone, or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects 
of these medicines taken together with Zoledronic Acid Hospira are unknown. 
Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw 
(ONJ). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or 
think that you may be pregnant. 
You must not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira if you are breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
There have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira. You should therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that 
need full attention. 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
3 
- 
- 
- 
How Zoledronic Acid Hospira is used 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in 
administering bisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein (also referred to as ‘IV’ 
administration). 
Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent 
dehydration.  
Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
How much Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given 
- 
The usual single dose given is 4 mg. 
- 
If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity 
of your kidney problem. 
How often Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given 
- 
If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you 
will be given one infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira every three to four weeks. 
If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only 
be given one infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira. 
- 
How Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given 
- 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 
minutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. 
Patients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D 
supplements to be taken each day. 
If you are given more Zoledronic Acid Hospira than you should be 
If you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your 
doctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of 
calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney 
impairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by 
infusion.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most 
common ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time. 
Tell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
- 
Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific 
blood tests). 
Low level of calcium in the blood. 
- 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
- 
Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw 
discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could be 
signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you

− 
experience such symptoms while being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira or after stopping 
treatment. 
Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this 
irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms 
after you have received zoledronic acid. 
Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat. 
- 
-

− 
− 
− 
Slow heart beat. 
Confusion. 
Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for 
osteoporosis may occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or 
discomfort in your thigh, hip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible 
fracture of the thigh bone. 
Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs) 
Flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling. 
Painful redness and/or swelling of the eye. 
−

INFORMATION FOR THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL 
How to prepare and administer Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
- 
To prepare an infusion solution containing 4 mg zoledronic acid, further dilute the Zoledronic 
Acid Hospira concentrate (5.0 ml) with 100 ml of calcium-free or other divalent cation-free 
infusion solution. If a lower dose of Zoledronic Acid Hospira is required, first withdraw the 
appropriate volume as indicated below and then dilute it further with 100 ml of infusion 
solution. To avoid potential incompatibilities, the infusion solution used for dilution must be 
either 0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution for injection or 5% w/v glucose solution. 
Do not mix Zoledronic Acid Hospira concentrate with calcium-containing or other divalent 
cation-containing solutions such as lactated Ringer’s solution. 
Instructions for preparing reduced doses of Zoledronic Acid Hospira: 
Withdraw the appropriate volume of the liquid concentrate, as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose 
4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose 
3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
For single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from 
particles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the 
preparation of the infusion. 
From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution for infusion should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C. The 
refrigerated solution should then be equilibrated to room temperature prior to administration. 
The solution containing zoledronic acid is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a 
separate infusion line. The hydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following 
administration of zoledronic acid to ensure that they are adequately hydrated. 
Studies with several types of infusion lines made from polyvinylchloride, polyethylene and 
polypropylene showed no incompatibility with zoledronic acid. 
Since no data are available on the compatibility of Zoledronic Acid Hospira with other 
intravenously administered substances, Zoledronic Acid Hospira must not be mixed with other 
medicinal products/substances and should always be given through a separate infusion line. 
How to store Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Keep Zoledronic Acid Hospira out of the reach and sight of children. 
Do not use Zoledronic Acid Hospira after the expiry date stated on the pack. 
The unopened vial does not require any specific storage conditions. 
The diluted Zoledronic Acid Hospira infusion solution should be used immediately in order to 
avoid microbial contamination.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1  What Zoledronic Acid Hospira is and what it is used for 
The active substance in Zoledronic Acid Hospira is zoledronic acid, which belongs to a group of 
substances called bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing 
down the rate of bone change. It is used: 
• 
To prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread 
of cancer from primary site to the bone). 
To reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the 
presence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the 
release of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
• 
2  What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zoledronic Acid Hospira and 
will check your response to treatment at regular intervals. 
You should not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira: 
- 
- 
if you are breast-feeding. 
if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which 
zoledronic acid belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira: 
- 
- 
if you have or have had a kidney problem. 
if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the jaw 
or loosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start 
treatment with Zoledronic Acid Hospira. 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that you 
are being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira and inform your doctor about your dental 
treatment. 
While being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including 
regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. 
Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a 
condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are 
undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are 
smokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Reduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry 
skin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Irregular heart 
beat (cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to 
severe hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these 
apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be 
corrected before initiating the first dose of Zoledronic acid. You will be given adequate calcium and 
vitamin D supplements. 
Patients aged 65 years and over 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to 
suggest that any extra precautions are needed. 
Children and adolescents 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 18 
years. 
Other medicines and Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, It is 
especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: 
- 
Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used 
to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to 
treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the 
combination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become 
too low. 
Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any 
other medicines which may harm your kidneys. 
Any other medicines that also contains zoledronic acid and is used to treat osteoporosis and 
other non-cancer diseases of the bone, or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects 
of these medicines taken together with Zoledronic Acid Hospira are unknown. 
Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw 
(ONJ). 
- 
- 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or 
think that you may be pregnant. 
You must not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira if you are breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
There have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of Zoledronic Acid 
Hospira. You should therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that 
need full attention. 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira contains sodium 
This medicine contains 360 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dosage unit. 
This is equivalent to 18% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.

- 
- 
- 
How Zoledronic Acid Hospira is used 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in 
administering bisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein. 
Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent 
dehydration. 
Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
How much Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given 
- 
The usual single dose given is 4 mg. 
- 
If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity 
of your kidney problem. 
How often Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given 
- 
If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you 
will be given one infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira every three to four weeks. 
If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only 
be given one infusion of Zoledronic Acid Hospira. 
- 
How Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given 
- 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 
minutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. 
Patients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D 
supplements to be taken each day. 
If you are given more Zoledronic Acid Hospira than you should be 
If you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your 
doctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of 
calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney 
impairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by 
infusion.

- 
Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw 
discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could be 
signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you 
experience such symptoms while being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira or after stopping 
treatment. 
Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this 
irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms 
after you have received zoledronic acid. 
Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat. 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
− 
As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to 
hypocalcaemia).

doctor with certain urine tests). 
Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): 
- 
As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to 
hypocalcaemia). 
Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These 
could be signs of bone damage in the ear.  
Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially 
the hip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or 
worsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira or after 
stopping treatment.  
Tell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible:

How to prepare and administer Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion contains 4 mg zoledronic acid in 
100 ml of infusion solution for immediate use in patients with normal renal function.  
For single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from 
particles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the 
preparation of the infusion. 
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user 
and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C. The refrigerated solution should 
then be equilibrated to room temperature prior to administration. 
The solution containing zoledronic acid must not be further diluted or mixed with other infusion 
solutions. It is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a separate infusion line. The 
hydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following administration of zoledronic 
acid to assure that they are adequately hydrated. 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion can be used immediately without 
further preparation for patients with normal renal function. In patients with mild to moderate 
renal impairment, reduced doses should be prepared as instructed below. 
To prepare reduced doses for patients with baseline CLcr ≤ 60 ml/min, refer to Table 1 below. 
Remove the volume of Zoledronic Acid Hospira solution indicated from the bag prior to 
administration.  
Table 1: Preparation of reduced doses of Zoledronic Acid Hospira 4 mg/100 ml solution for 
infusion

Contents of the pack and other information 
1  What Zoledronic Acid Hospira is and what it is used for 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira contains the active substance zoledronic acid. It belongs to a group of 
medicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat Paget’s disease of the bone in adults.  
It is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material. This process is called 
remodelling. In Paget’s disease, bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered 
fashion, which makes it weaker than normal. If the disease is not treated, bones may become deformed 
and painful, and may break. Zoledronic Acid Hospira works by returning the bone remodelling 
process to normal, securing formation of normal bone, thus restoring strength to the bone.  
2  What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
Follow all instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse carefully before you are given 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira.  
You must not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira: 
- 
if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6).  
if you have hypocalcaemia (this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low).  
if you have severe kidney problems. 
if you are pregnant.  
if you are breast-feeding.  
- 
- 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Zoledronic Acid Hospira:  
- 
if you are being treated with any medicine containing zoledronic acid, which is also the active 
substance of Zoledronic Acid Hospira (zoledronic acid is used in adult patients with certain 
types of cancer to prevent bone complications or to reduce the amount of calcium). 
if you have a kidney problem, or used to have one.  
if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements.  
- 
- 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed.  
if you have had sections of your intestine removed.  
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported in the 
post-marketing setting in patients receiving zoledronic acid for osteoporosis. ONJ can also occur after 
stopping treatment. 
It is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to 
treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw, there are some precautions 
you should take. 
Before receiving Zoledronic Acid Hospira treatment, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction; 
you do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; 
you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); 
you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders); 
you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) 
you have cancer. 
Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with Zoledronic 
Acid Hospira. 
While being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including 
regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make 
sure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery (e.g. 
tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are 
being treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira. Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you 
experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing 
of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Monitoring test 
Your doctor should do a blood test to check your kidney function (levels of creatinine) before each 
dose of Zoledronic Acid Hospira. It is important for you to drink at least 2 glasses of fluid (such as 
water), within a few hours before receiving Zoledronic Acid Hospira, as directed by your healthcare 
provider. 
Children and adolescents 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age.  
Other medicines and Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
It is important for your doctor to know all the medicines you are taking, especially if you are taking 
any medicines known to be harmful to your kidneys (e.g. aminoglycosides) or diuretics (“waterpills”) 
that may cause dehydration.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
You must not be given Zoledronic Acid Hospira if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may 
be pregnant or are planning to have a baby.

How Zoledronic Acid Hospira is given 
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse. Check with your doctor or nurse 
if you are not sure.  
For the treatment of Paget’s disease, Zoledronic Acid Hospira should be prescribed only by physicians 
with experience in the treatment of Paget’s disease of the bone. 
The usual dose is 5 mg, given to you as one initial infusion into a vein by your doctor or nurse. The 
infusion will take at least 15 minutes. Zoledronic Acid Hospira may work for longer than one year, 
and your doctor will let you know if you need to be treated again.  
Your doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (e.g. tablets) for at least the 
first ten days after being given Zoledronic Acid Hospira. It is important that you follow this advice 
carefully so that the level of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after the 
infusion. Your doctor will inform you regarding the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia.  
Zoledronic Acid Hospira with food and drink 
Make sure you drink enough fluids (at least one or two glasses) before and after the treatment with 
Zoledronic Acid Hospira, as directed by your doctor. This will help to prevent dehydration. You may 
eat normally on the day you are treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira. This is especially important in 
patients who take diuretics (“water pills”) and in elderly patients (age 65 years or over). 
If you missed a dose of Zoledronic Acid Hospira 
Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment.  
Before stopping Zoledronic Acid Hospira therapy  
If you are considering stopping Zoledronic Acid Hospira treatment, please go to your next 
appointment and discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you 
should be treated with Zoledronic Acid Hospira.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

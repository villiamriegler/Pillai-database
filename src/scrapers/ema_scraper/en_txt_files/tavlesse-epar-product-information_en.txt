4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1.  Therapeutic indications 
TAVLESSE is indicated for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients 
who are refractory to other treatments (see section 5.1). 
4.2.  Posology and method of administration 
Fostamatinib treatment should be initiated and remain under the supervision of a physician who is 
experienced in the treatment of haematological diseases.

Posology 
Fostamatinib dosing requirements must be individualised based on the patient’s platelet counts. The 
lowest dose of fostamatinib to achieve and maintain a platelet count of at least 50,000/µL should be 
used. Dose adjustments are based upon the platelet count response and tolerability (see table 2). 
The recommended starting dose of fostamatinib is 100 mg twice daily.  
After initiating fostamatinib, the dose can be increased to 150 mg twice daily after 4 weeks based on 
platelet count and tolerability. A daily dose of 300 mg daily must not be exceeded. 
Missed dose 
In the case of a missed dose of fostamatinib, patients should take their next dose at its regularly 
scheduled time. 
Discontinuation 
Treatment with fostamatinib should be discontinued after 12 weeks of fostamatinib therapy if the 
platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding. 
Monitoring and dose modifications 
Fostamatinib dose modification is recommended based on tolerability and platelet counts. 
Management of some adverse reactions may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation 
(see table 1 and table 2).  
Clinical haematology, blood pressure and liver function tests should be monitored regularly 
throughout therapy with fostamatinib (see section 4.4.) and the dosing should be adjusted as outlined 
in table 1. For example, if a patient is on the maximum dose at the time of an adverse reaction, the first 
dose reduction would be from 300 mg/day to 200 mg/day.

Recommended action 
Initiate or increase dose of antihypertensive medication for 
patients with increased cardiovascular risk, and adjust as needed 
until blood pressure (BP) is controlled. 
If the BP target is not met after 8 weeks, reduce fostamatinib to 
next lower daily dose (refer to table 1). 
Initiate or increase dose of antihypertensive medication, and 
adjust as needed until BP is controlled. 
If BP remains 140/90 mmHg or higher for more than 8 weeks, 
reduce fostamatinib to next lower daily dose (refer to table 1). 
If BP remains 160/100 mmHg or higher for more than 4 weeks 
despite aggressive antihypertensive therapy, interrupt or 
discontinue fostamatinib. 
Interrupt or discontinue fostamatinib. 
Initiate or increase dose of antihypertensive medication, and 
adjust as needed until BP is controlled. If BP returns to less than 
the target BP, resume fostamatinib at same daily dose. 
If repeat BP is 160/100 mmHg or higher for more than 4 weeks 
despite aggressive antihypertensive treatment, discontinue 
fostamatinib.  
If patient is symptomatic (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain): 
Interrupt fostamatinib. 
Recheck LFTs every 72 hours until ALT/AST values are no 
longer elevated (below 1.5 x ULN) and total BL remains less 
than 2 x ULN. 
Resume fostamatinib at next lower daily dose (refer to table 1). 
If patient is asymptomatic: 
Recheck LFTs every 72 hours until ALT/AST are below 
1.5 x ULN) and total BL remains less than 2 x ULN. 
Consider interruption or dose reduction of fostamatinib if 
ALT/AST and TBL remain in this category (AST/ALT is 3 to 5 x 
ULN; and total BL remains less than 2 x ULN). 
If interrupted, resume fostamatinib at next lower daily dose (refer 
to table 1) when ALT/AST are no longer elevated (below 
1.5 x ULN) and total BL remains less than 2 x ULN. 
Interrupt fostamatinib. 
Recheck LFTs every 72 hours: 
If AST and ALT decrease, recheck until ALT and AST are no 
longer elevated (below 1.5 x ULN) and total BL remains less 
than 2 x ULN; resume fostamatinib at next lower daily dose 
(refer to table 1). 
If AST/ALT persist at 5 x ULN or higher for 2 weeks or more, 
discontinue fostamatinib.  
Discontinue fostamatinib. 
Continue fostamatinib with frequent monitoring since isolated 
increase in unconjugated (indirect) BL may be due to UGT1A1 
inhibition. 
Manage diarrhoea using supportive measures (e.g., dietary 
changes, hydration and/or antidiarrhoeal medication) early after 
the onset until symptom(s) have resolved.

Neutropenia 
Neutropenia 
If symptom(s) become severe (Grade 3 or above), temporarily 
interrupt fostamatinib. 
If diarrhoea improves to mild (Grade 1), resume fostamatinib at 
the next lower daily dose (refer to table 1). 
If absolute neutrophil count decreases (ANC less than 
1.0 x 109/L) and remains low after 72 hours, temporarily interrupt 
fostamatinib until resolved (ANC greater than 1.5 x 109/L). 
Resume fostamatinib at the next lower daily dose (refer to 
table 1). 
ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; BP = blood pressure; BL = bilirubin;  
ULN = upper limit of normal; ANC = absolute neutrophil count 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment 
Fostamatinib should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment, monitoring of liver function throughout therapy with fostamatinib 
should be done. Dose regimen adjustment according to platelet counts and tolerability may be required 
(see table 1 and table 2, and section 4.4).  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.  
Paediatric population 
Fostamatinib should not be used in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age because of 
adverse reactions on actively growing bones observed in nonclinical studies (see section 5.3). 
Method of administration  
Fostamatinib is for oral use. 
The tablets should be taken twice daily, whole with or without food (see section 5.2). In the event of 
gastric upset, tablets may be taken with food. 
4.3.  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
4.4.  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Information is based on ITP placebo-controlled population unless specified.  
Excipients:  
TAVLESSE 100 mg film-coated tablets contains 23 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 1.2% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
TAVLESSE 150 mg film-coated tablets contains 34 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 1.7% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

Hypertension 
Over the range of doses studied in healthy volunteers, the effect of R406 (the major active metabolite 
of fostamatinib) on BP appears to be dose-dependent and varies among subjects. In the ITP placebo-
controlled population, increased blood pressure, including the development of hypertension, was 
reported in patients treated with fostamatinib. Hypertensive crisis occurred in 1 (1%) patient. Patients 
with pre-existing hypertension may be more susceptible to the hypertensive effects of fostamatinib. In 
clinical studies, the blood pressure effects resolved within a week of discontinuing treatment.  
The patient’s blood pressure should be monitored every two weeks until stable, then monthly, and 
adjust or initiate antihypertensive therapy to ensure maintenance of blood pressure control during 
fostamatinib therapy. If increased blood pressure persists despite appropriate therapy, the physician 
should consider fostamatinib dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation (see section 4.2). 
Liver function test abnormalities and risk of hepatotoxicity 
In the placebo-controlled studies, laboratory testing showed maximum ALT/AST levels more than 3 x 
the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 9% of patients receiving fostamatinib and no patients receiving 
placebo.  
Sparse data suggest an increase risk of hyperbilirubinemia in patients with genetic polymorphisms of 
UGT1A1, e.g. Gilbert, the physician should monitor these patients frequently (see section 4.2). 
For all patients, transaminases recovered generally to baseline levels within 2 to 6 weeks of dose-
modification. The physician should monitor liver function tests monthly during treatment. If ALT or 
AST increase more than 3 x ULN, the physician should manage hepatotoxicity by treatment 
interruption, reduction or discontinuation. Concomitant total bilirubin increases greater than 2 X ULN 
should lead to treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2). 
Complete blood counts (CBCs) 
The physician should monitor CBCs, including platelet counts, monthly until a stable platelet count (of 
at least 50,000/µL) is achieved. Thereafter, the physician should continue to monitor CBCs, including 
neutrophils, regularly. 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea is the most common adverse reaction with fostamatinib treatment, but severe diarrhoea 
occurred in 1% of patients. Patients should be monitored for the development of diarrhoea and 
managed by using supportive care measures (e.g., dietary changes, hydration and/or antidiarrhoeal 
medication) early after the onset of symptoms. If diarrhoea becomes severe (Grade 3 or above), 
administration of fostamatinib should be interrupted, reduced, or discontinued (see section 4.2). 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia occurred in 7% of patients treated with fostamatinib; febrile neutropenia occurred in 1% 
of patients. Patients with neutropenia may be more susceptible to infections.  
The physician should monitor the absolute neutrophil count monthly. The physician should manage 
toxicity with fostamatinib interruption, reduction or discontinuation (see section 4.2). 
Infections 
Infections, including pneumonia and respiratory tract infections, have been reported during clinical 
trials (see section 4.8).  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The patient should be monitored for infection during treatment. The benefit risk of continuing therapy 
during an infection should be evaluated by the physician. 
Bone remodeling 
Since fostamatinib was shown in vitro to not only target SYK but also other tyrosine kinases that are 
involved in the bone metabolism (e.g., VEGFR, RET), any potential untargeted effects on bone 
remodelling or formation remain undetermined, especially in patients with osteoporosis, patients with 
fractures or young adults where epiphyseal fusion has not yet occurred. Closer monitoring in these 
patients is therefore recommended. The benefit risk of continuing therapy during the healing of a bone 
fracture should be thoroughly evaluated by the physician. 
4.5.  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on fostamatinib 
Concomitant use of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer (600 mg once daily for 8 days) with a single 
dose of 150 mg fostamatinib decreased R406 AUC by 75% and Cmax by 59%. 
Concomitant use of fostamatinib with strong CYP3A4 inducers decreases exposure to R406, which 
may result in reduced efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of fostamatinib with strong CYP3A4 
inducers is not recommended. 
Concomitant use of fostamatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases exposure to R406 (the 
major active metabolite), which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. The patient should be 
monitored for toxicities of fostamatinib that may require dose reduction (see table 2) when given 
concurrently with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. For treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor of shorter 
periods, e.g. antifungals or antibacterial treatment, dose reductions could be warranted from the 
beginning of the additional treatment. A two-fold reduction in dose frequency (i.e. from 150 mg twice 
daily to 150 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily to 100 mg once daily) of fostamatinib in the 
presence of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted. The physician should consider resuming the 
fostamatinib dose that was used prior to concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 2 to 3 days 
after discontinuation of the inhibitor. 
Concomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (200 mg twice daily for 3.5 days) with a 
single dose of 80 mg fostamatinib (0.53 times the 150 mg dose) increased R406 AUC by 102% and 
Cmax by 37%.  
Other medicinal products with strong CYP3A4 inhibition potential when coadministered with 
fostamatinib are: 
boceprevir, cobicistat, conivaptan, danoprevir and ritonavir, elvitegravir and ritonavir, grapefruit 
juice, indinavir and ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir and ritonavir, paritaprevir and 
ritonavir and (ombitasvir and/or dasabuvir), posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir and ritonavir, 
telaprevir, tipranavir and ritonavir, troleandomycin, voriconazole, clarithromycin, diltiazem, 
idelalisib, nefazodone, nelfinavir 
Concomitant use of verapamil, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (80 mg three times daily for 4 days) 
with a single dose of 150 mg fostamatinib increased R406 (the major active metabolite) AUC by 39% 
and Cmax by 6%. 
Increase in gastric pH does not affect exposure of R406 
Coadministration of fostamatinib with 150 mg ranitidine, an H2-blocker that increases gastric pH did 
not have clinically relevant impact on R406 exposure.

Effects of fostamatinib on other medicinal products 
CYP3A4 substrate  
Concomitant use of fostamatinib may increase systemic exposure of some CYP3A4 substrate 
medicinal products. Patients should be monitored for toxicities of CYP3A4 substrate medicinal 
products, that may require dose reduction when given concurrently with fostamatinib.  
Concomitant use of simvastatin (single dose 40 mg) with fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice 
daily increased simvastatin AUC by 64% and Cmax by 113% and simvastatin acid AUC by 66% and 
Cmax by 83%. 
Concomitant use of midazolam (single dose 7.5 mg) with fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice 
daily increased midazolam AUC by 23% and Cmax by 9%. 
Concomitant use of a combined hormonal contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol with 
fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice daily increased AUC by 28% and Cmax by 34%. 
BCRP and P-gp substrate 
Concomitant use of fostamatinib may increase concentrations of P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin) and 
BCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin). The toxicities of these drugs should be monitored as a dose 
reduction may be required when given concurrently with fostamatinib. For rosuvastatin, shift to 
another treatment should be considered and for digoxin, additional therapeutic drug monitoring could 
be necessary. 
Concomitant use of rosuvastatin (single dose 20 mg) with fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice 
daily increased rosuvastatin AUC by 95% and Cmax by 88%. 
Concomitant use of digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice daily 
increased digoxin AUC by 37% and Cmax by 70%. 
CYP2C8 substrate 
Concomitant use of fostamatinib does not affect the exposure of CYP2C8 substrate drugs. No dose 
adjustment of CYP2C8 substrate drug is necessary.  
Concomitant use of pioglitazone (single dose 30 mg) with fostamatinib 100 mg administered twice 
daily increased pioglitazone AUC by 18% and decreased Cmax by 17%. Hydroxyl-pioglitazone AUC 
and Cmax decreased by 10% and by 9%, respectively. 
Effect on warfarin 
Since SYK-inhibition may have potential effects on platelet aggregation, anticoagulant activity (e.g. 
INR) where relevant should be monitored when anticoagulants with narrow therapeutic index such as 
warfarin, are co-administered with fostamatinib. 
Co-administration with JAK-inhibitor, TPO-RAs, rituximab and other immune-modulating agents has 
not been investigated. 
In vitro studies 
Fostamatinib is an inhibitor of the human P-gp efflux transporter in vitro. 
CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 are involved in the metabolism of R406. R406 is a substrate of P-gp but not of 
other major transporters (OAT1/3, OCT2, OATP1B1/3, MRP2, and BCRP). R406 can inhibit 
CYP3A4 and BCRP, and can induce CYP2C8 activity. R406 is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and 
UGT2B7.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
R406 is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Inhibition of UGT1A1 may result in increased unconjugated 
bilirubin in the absence of other LFT abnormalities. Patients should be monitored for toxicity for drugs 
that are metabolised extensively by UGT1A1. 
Although R406 shows no inhibitory activity against UGT2B7 in vitro and is considered as a weak 
UGT1A1 inhibitor in vivo, the effect on other UGTs has not been determined. The potential of PK 
DDI for co-administration with acetaminophen therefore remains undetermined. 
4.6.  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and at least one 
month after the last dose. 
Pregnancy 
Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, fostamatinib can cause foetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnant women should be advised about the potential 
risk to a foetus  
Pregnancies occurring during clinical trials resulted in healthy newborns as well as 
stillbirths/spontaneous abortions and miscarriages (see sections 4.3 and 5.3).  
If a patient becomes pregnant while taking fostamatinib, therapy should be discontinued. Fostamatinib 
is contraindicated during pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether fostamatinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of fostamatinib 
metabolites in milk (see section 5.3) A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with fostamatinib and for at least one month after the last 
dose.  
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of fostamatinib on human fertility. Based on the finding of reduced 
pregnancy rates in animal studies, fostamatinib may affect female fertility (see section 5.3). 
Studies in animals have shown no adverse effect on male fertility. Given there is no evidence for 
mutagenic or clastogenic potential, there is no concern for male-mediated birth defects. 
4.7.  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Fostamatinib is not expected to influence the ability to drive or to use machines. The patient should 
avoid driving cars or using machines if feeling dizzy. 
4.8.  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In the ITP placebo-controlled studies, serious adverse drug reactions were febrile neutropenia, 
diarrhoea, pneumonia, and hypertensive crisis, which each occurred in 1% of patients receiving 
fostamatinib. In addition, severe adverse reactions observed in patients receiving fostamatinib

Description of selected adverse reactions 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with fostamatinib were hypertension, liver 
function test abnormaltities, diarrhoea, neutropenia and infections. 
Hypertension 
Increases in blood pressure were dose dependent in early studies with fostamatinib in healthy subjects 
(see section 4.4). Hypertension events were reversible within days after dose discontinuation in these 
subjects.  
In the ITP placebo-controlled population, hypertension-related adverse reactions were reported for 
27.5% of patients receiving fostamatinib and 12.5% of patients receiving placebo in the placebo-
controlled studies. Hypertension-related adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity, 
with 2 patients receiving fostamatinib and 1 subject receiving placebo experiencing severe 
hypertension. Hypertensive crises was reported as a serious adverse reaction and occurred in 1 (1%) 
patient receiving fostamatinib. Dose modification (reduction or interruption) was required for 4 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients receiving fostamatinib and no placebo patients. Study drug was withdrawn due to a 
hypertension-related adverse reaction in 1 patient receiving placebo and no patients receiving 
fostamatinib.  
Approximately 20% of patients receiving fostamatinib required at least 1 intervention for 
hypertension-related events: increase in antihypertensive medications and/or a new antihypertensive 
medication.  
Liver function test abnormalities and risk of hepatotoxicity 
Mild to moderate increases in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) were observed in fostamatinib treated 
subjects in phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, occurring more frequently at the higher doses tested 
(250 mg oral twice daily). These changes were mild and all were reversible (see section 4.4).  
In the ITP placebo-controlled population, transaminase elevation adverse reactions (ALT increased 
and AST increased) were reported in 11% and 9% of patients receiving fostamatinib. All transaminase 
elevations were mild or moderate in severity and dose modification (dose reduction or dose 
interruption) was required in 8 patients. One patient discontinued fostamatinib due to a transaminase 
elevation (ALT increased); this event resolved after discontinuation of treatment.  
In the ITP placebo-controlled population, laboratory testing showed maximum ALT/AST levels more 
than 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 9% of patients receiving fostamatinib and no patients 
receiving placebo. Maximum ALT and/or AST levels were > 10 x ULN in 1 patient receiving 
fostamatinib. Transaminase elevations recovered to baseline levels within 2 to 4 weeks of dose 
modification. The median (range) time to onset of transaminase elevation was 58 days (43 to 127), and 
the median (range) duration of each event was 14.5 days (6 to 28 days). 
Diarrhoea 
Gastrointestinal complaints, specifically noninfectious diarrhoea events, were among the most 
common adverse reactions reported in patients treated with fostamatinib throughout the clinical 
development program. Non-infectious diarrhoea events are considered definitely related to 
fostamatinib treatment (see section 4.4).  
In the placebo-controlled ITP population, noninfectious diarrhoea was the most commonly reported GI 
complaint, occurring in 31% of subjects receiving fostamatinib. Noninfectious diarrhoea events were 
most frequently mild-to-moderate in severity. The majority of subjects with moderate diarrhoea 
received antidiarrhoeal agents (loperamide) to mitigate their symptoms. Severe diarrhoea was reported 
in 1% of patients receiving fostamatinib during the placebo-controlled period. Dose modification 
(interruption or reduction) was reported for approximately 5% of subjects receiving fostamatinib; 
however study drug was discontinued because of adverse events (AEs) of diarrhoea in a single 
fostamatinib subject during the placebo-controlled period.  
Approximately 25% of patients receiving fostamatinib experienced noninfectious diarrhoea during the 
first 12 weeks of treatment during the placebo-controlled period. Among the patients receiving 
fostamatinib who had moderate or severe diarrhoea, the median time to the first occurrence of 
moderate or severe diarrhoea was 57 days and the median duration of the events was approximately 
15 days.  
Neutropenia 
In the initial Phase 1 human subject study, it was observed that at higher fostamatinib doses (up to 
300 mg twice daily), the biologically active component of fostamatinib produced significant 
reductions in neutrophils, which were rapidly reversible upon discontinuation of therapy (see section 
4.4). The rapidity of the recovery suggested a compartment effect more than an effect on progenitors. 
This effect on neutrophils was observed in all clinical programs. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the placebo-controlled ITP population, neutropenia adverse reactions were reported for 7% of 
patients in the fostamatinib group and no patients in the placebo group. Most neutropenia adverse 
reactions were not associated with an infection and were mild or moderate in severity. Severe 
neutropenia was reported in 2 patients; 1 of these was a serious adverse reaction of febrile neutropenia 
that was attributed to an unknown infection. Three patients required dose modification for neutropenia 
per protocol, and study drug was discontinued due to neutropenia in 1 patient. All neutropenia adverse 
reactions except 1 resolved by the end of the study.  
In the placebo-controlled ITP population, 2 patients receiving fostamatinib and no patients receiving 
placebo had a decrease in neutrophils to between ≥ 0.5 and < 1.0 × 109/L. Seven patients receiving 
fostamatinib and 1 patient receiving placebo had neutrophil counts decrease to between ≥ 1.0 and 
< 1.5 × 109/L. No patient had a decrease in neutrophils to < 0.5 × 109/L. 
Infections 
In the placebo-controlled ITP population, infection adverse reactions were reported in 30% of patients 
receiving fostamatinib and 20% of patients receiving placebo (see section 4.4). Infections involving 
the respiratory tract accounted for 60% of the adverse events in the fostamatinib group and 40% of the 
events in the placebo group. No systemic opportunistic infections were reported in the fostamatinib 
program. Serious adverse reactions for infection were uncommon. Severe infection events included 
pneumonia and influenza-like illness (1 patient each in the fostamatinib group) and sepsis (1 patient in 
the placebo group). One patient in the fostamatinib group discontinued study treatment due to an 
infection (pneumonia). Neutropenia was rarely associated with infection.  
Elderly population  
Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of fostamatinib, 16.4% were 65 years of age and 
older, while 2.4% were 75 years of age and older. In general, incidences of adverse reactions were 
higher in the older population.  
In patients 65 years of age and older, 6 (21%) patients experienced serious adverse events and 5 (18%) 
experienced adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal while in patients under 65 years of age, 
7 (9%) and 5 (7%) experienced serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment 
withdrawal, respectively. In patients 65 years of age and older who received fostamatinib, 11 (39%) 
patients experienced hypertension versus 2 (18%) placebo compared to 17 (23%) in patients under 
65 years of age versus 4 (11%) placebo. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9.  Overdose 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with fostamatinib, and the amount of R406 cleared by 
dialysis is negligible. There has not been any experience of overdose in the clinical development 
program. In the event of an overdose, the physician should monitor the patient closely for signs and 
symptoms of adverse reactions as described in section 4.2, and treat the reactions with supportive care.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1.  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics, other systemic haemostatics. ATC code: B02BX09 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Fostamatinib mediates its activity effectively through its major metabolite, R406, which is a tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor with demonstrated activity against spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). R406 inhibits signal 
transduction of B-cell receptors and Fc-activating receptors, which play a key role in antibody-
mediated cellular responses. The fostamatinib metabolite R406 reduces antibody-mediated destruction 
of platelets. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of fostamatinib has been demonstrated in two Phase III, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled studies (C788-047 and C788-048) in adult patients with previously treated 
persistent (3-12 months since diagnosis) or chronic (greater than 12 months since diagnosis) ITP.  
Randomised, placebo-controlled studies 
A total of 150 patients with persistent or chronic ITP, who had an insufficient response to previous 
treatment (which included corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, splenectomy, and/or a thrombopoietin 
receptor agonists) were enrolled in two identical, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that were 
conducted in different countries.  
For each study, patients were randomised 2:1 to fostamatinib or placebo for 24 weeks; randomisation 
was stratified with respect to prior splenectomy and severity of thrombocytopenia. Stable concurrent 
ITP therapy (glucocorticoids [less than 20 mg prednisone equivalent per day], azathioprine, or 
danazol) was allowed, and rescue therapy was permitted, if needed. All patients initially received 
study drug at 100 mg twice daily (or matching placebo). Based on platelet count and tolerability, dose 
escalation to 150 mg twice daily (or matching placebo) was undertaken in 86% of patients at Week 4 
or later.  
Patients enrolled in the placebo-controlled studies had a median age of 54 years old (range: 20 to 
88 years; median age in C788-047 was 57.0 and in C788-048 was 49.5 years), and the majority were 
female (61%) and were white (93%). Prior ITP treatments were varied (median of 3, range of 1-14), 
with the most common including corticosteroids (94%), immunoglobulins (53%), and thrombopoietin 
receptor agonists (TPO-RA) (48%). Most patients had chronic ITP (93%), with a median time since 
ITP diagnosis of 8.5 years, and 35% had undergone splenectomy. At baseline, the median platelet 
count was 16,000/µL (with almost half [45%] less than 15,000/µL) and 47% were on stable ITP 
therapy. Of the 102 patients with ITP who received fostamatinib, 28 (27%) were 65 years of age and 
older while 11 (11%) were 75 years of age and older. 
In Study C788-047, 76 patients were randomised; 51 to the fostamatinib group and 25 to the placebo 
group. In Study C788-048, 74 patients were randomised; 50 to the fostamatinib group and 24 to the 
placebo group. The efficacy of fostamatinib was based on the primary endpoint of stable platelet 
response (at least 50,000/µL on at least 4 of the 6 visits between Weeks 14 to 24). Study outcomes for 
C788-047 and C788-048 are shown in table 4.

Fosta = fostamatinib; PBO = placebo; NS = Did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between 
treatment arms 
An initial therapeutic response (platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL) was observed within 6 weeks for most 
responders (11 of 17 responders) and within 12 weeks for all stable responders. 
Among patients who were stable responders, the median platelet count increased to 95,000/µL across 
post-baseline visits with a maximum of 150,000/µL. Rescue medication was required by 30% and 
45% of patients receiving fostamatinib or placebo, respectively. 
During the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of bleeding occurred in 29% and 37% of patients 
in the fostamatinib and placebo arms, respectively. The incidence of moderate or severe 
bleeding-related adverse events (AEs) (16.3% vs. 9.9%) and serious adverse events (SAEs) (10.2% vs 
5.0%) was about twice as high in the placebo group compared with the fostamatinib group. Only one 
subject treated with fostamatinib experienced a severe bleeding-related event (contusion), while three 
subjects treated with placebo experienced severe events (gastrointestinal haemorrhage, menorrhagia 
and petechiae). In sum, there were trends for reduced bleeding-related AEs with fostamatinib 
compared to placebo; differences between the groups were not statistically significant.  
Subset analyses 
Platelet count responses for patients treated with TAVLESSE were further analysed as shown in table 
5. Results are shown for both the pooled population (from Studies C788-047 and C788-048) and a 
refractory patient population defined as the subgroup of patients who had received three or more prior 
other ITP therapies. For all platelet count parameters, the results for the pooled population are 
comparable to the refractory patient population.

Extension Study 
The C788-049 trial is an open label extension study. Patients from C788-047 and C788-048 who 
completed 24 weeks of treatment, or who did not respond to treatment after 12 weeks, were eligible to 
enrol in this study. Patients remained blinded to their treatment assignment from the previous study 
(fostamatinib or placebo), so their starting dose in this study was based on their final platelet count. 
For the C788-049 trial, 123 patients were enrolled, 44 patients previously randomised to placebo and 
79 patients previously randomised to fostamatinib.  
Placebo Crossover: In a prospectively defined analysis, the 44 subjects treated with placebo in the 
prior study were evaluated for stable response for fostamatinib (from the first 24 weeks of the study) 
with their placebo data as the comparator for this objective measure. Ten of these subjects (22.7%) 
(including a single subject who was classified as a placebo responder in the prior study) met the 
criteria for stable response. Thus, the difference in response from fostamatinib compared with placebo 
was 20.5% (95% CI = 8.5-32.4).  
Extension: Among the patients who achieved stable response in C788-047, C788-048 and C788-049 
trials, 18 subjects maintained the platelet count of at least 50,000/µL for 12 months or longer. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
fostamatinib in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of thrombocytopenia for 
patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), who have had an insufficient response to a 
previous treatment (e.g., corticosteroids), (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2.  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, the prodrug fostamatinib is rapidly converted to its active metabolite 
R406, presumably via enzymes in the gut.  
After oral administration of fostamatinib, the mean absolute bioavailability of R406 was 55% with 
high variability (range 30 – 85 %). The median Tmax of R406 is approximately 1.5 hours (range: 1 to 
4 hours). Negligible levels of fostamatinib were found in plasma.  
After a single 150 mg oral dose of fostamatinib, mean (± standard deviation [SD]) exposure estimates 
of R406 are 550 (± 270) ng/mL for Cmax and 7080 (± 2670) ng/mL for AUC. R406 exposure is 
approximately dose proportional up to 200 mg twice daily (1.3 times the 150 mg dose). R406 
accumulates approximately 2- to 3-fold upon twice daily dosing at 100–160 mg (0.67 to 1.06 times the 
150 mg dose). 
Distribution 
Fostamatinib is highly bound to plasma proteins (98.3% in human plasma) and distributes reversibly 
into blood cells. The mean (± SD) volume of distribution at steady-state of R406 is 256 (± 92) L. 
Metabolism 
Fostamatinib is metabolised in the gut by alkaline phosphatase to the major active metabolite, R406. 
R406 is extensively metabolised, primarily through pathways of CYP450-mediated oxidation (by 
CYP3A4) and glucuronidation (by UDP glucuronosyltransferase [UGT]1A9). R406 is the 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
predominant moiety in the systemic circulation, and there was minimal exposure to any R406 
metabolites. 
Elimination/Excretion 
In humans, the mean (± SD) terminal half-life of R406 is approximately 15 (± 4.3) hours. 
Approximately 20% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine, primarily in the form 
of an N-glucuronide of R406. Renal elimination of parent drug was low. The remaining radioactivity 
(~80%) was recovered in the faeces, mainly represented by 2 major metabolites of R406.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
R406 pharmacokinetics is linear and exposure is approximately dose-proportional up to 200 mg twice 
daily (1.3 times the 150 mg dose). R406 accumulates approximately 2- to 3-fold upon twice daily 
dosing at 100-160 mg (0.67 to 1.06 times the 150 mg dose). 
Food interaction  
Administration of fostamatinib with a high-calorie, high-fat meal (deriving approximately 150, 250, 
and 500–600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively) increased R406 AUC by 23% 
and Cmax by 15%, indicating fostamatinib can be administered with or without food. 
Special populations 
Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicate fostamatinib is not altered based on age, sex, 
race/ethnicity.  
The pharmacokinetics of fostamatinib is not altered in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance [CLcr] = 30 to < 50 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft Gault equation and end stage renal 
disease requiring dialysis), or hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C). 
5.3.  Preclinical safety data 
In two fostamatinib 4-week rat studies (with the calcium and sodium salts), chondrodystrophy of the 
femoral head was observed in some animals in the highest dose groups (that were still juvenile/young 
during the treatment interval) and was not fully reversible by the end of the recovery period. 
In a 1-month study in juvenile rabbits, fostamatinib produced growth plate dysplasia in the proximal 
femur and femoro-tibial joint and reduced bone marrow cellularity in the femur and sternum at 30 and 
60 mg/kg/day. Increased degenerate/necrotic ovarian follicles occurred in females at all fostamatinib 
dose levels (including 10 mg/kg/day). The changes noted in the growth plates and ovaries are 
consistent with an anti-angiogenic effect. 
Fostamatinib was not carcinogenic in a 2-year study in mice when administered daily by oral gavage 
at doses up to 500/250 mg/kg/day, and was not carcinogenic in rats when administered by oral gavage 
at 45 mg/kg/day. Fostamatinib and its major active metabolite (R406) were not mutagenic in an in 
vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte 
chromosomal aberration assay or an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.  
Studies in animals have shown no adverse effect on male fertility. Given there is no evidence for 
mutagenic or clastogenic potential, there is no concern for male-mediated birth defects. In a fertility 
study with oral fostamatinib, all mating (e.g., time to mating, breeding proficiency), sperm 
assessments (e.g., number and motility), and organ weight (e.g., paired testis weight) parameters in 
male rats were unaffected by doses as high as 40 mg/kg/day. This dose yields an AUC of R406 
approximately 3.8 times that of the MRHD. All mating and fertility parameters in female rats were 
unaffected by doses as high as 11 mg/kg/day. This dose would yield an AUC of R406 similar to that of 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the MRHD. A slight decrease in pregnancy rates and an increase in post-implantation loss were seen at 
25 mg/kg/day. This dose would yield an AUC of R406 2.6 times that of the MRHD. 
In animal reproduction studies, administration of fostamatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during 
organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-foetal mortality (post-
implantation loss), alterations to growth (lower foetal weights), and structural abnormalities 
(variations and malformations) at maternal exposures (AUCs) approximately 0.3 and 10 times the 
human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) respectively. 
A slight decrease in pregnancy rates and an increase in post-implantation loss in female rats was 
observed. Nonclinical studies have established that the administration of fostamatinib during 
pregnancy can increase the risk of embryonic loss, retard growth, and promote specific malformations 
of the kidney (including agenesis) and associated urogenital (e.g. ureter) tissues, as well as 
variations/malformations in major vessel and skeletal development. These effects are consistent with 
known targets of fostamatinib, including Syk (target), VEGFR-2 (off target) and Ret-kinase (off 
target). Based on nonclinical studies, any latent issues with female fertility is not expected after 
fostamatinib is withdrawn. 
In pregnant rats and rabbits, R406 was found to cross the placenta. In general, the maternal plasma 
R406 concentrations were greater than the foetal plasma R406 concentrations. 
In rodents, R406 was detected in maternal milk in concentrations 5- to 10-fold higher than in maternal 
plasma.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What TAVLESSE is and what it is used for 
What TAVLESSE is 
TAVLESSE contains the active substance fostamatinib. It specifically targets an enzyme called spleen 
tyrosine kinase, that plays an important part in the destruction of platelets. In this way TAVLESSE 
limits platelet destruction by the immune system and increases platelet count in the body. This helps 
reduce the risk of severe bleeding. 
What TAVLESSE is used for 
TAVLESSE is used to treat adults with low platelet counts due to chronic immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) when an earlier treatment for ITP has not worked well enough. ITP is an autoimmune disease, in 
which the body’s own immune system attacks and destroys platelets in the blood. Platelets are needed 
to help create clots and stop bleeding. 
2.  What you need to know before you take TAVLESSE  
Do not take TAVLESSE 
 
if you are allergic to fostamatinib or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

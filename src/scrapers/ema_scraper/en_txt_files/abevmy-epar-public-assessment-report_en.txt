2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
About the product 
MYL-1402O has been developed by Mylan as a proposed biosimilar product to the reference medicinal product 
Avastin having bevacizumab as the active substance. MYL-1402O (bevacizumab) belongs to the 
pharmacotherapeutic group “monoclonal antibodies” (ATC code: L01XC07). 
Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech/Roche) is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody of the 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 class that selectively binds to Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The binding 
of bevacizumab to VEGF inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells, Flt-1 
(also known as VEGF receptor-1 [VEGFR-1]) and kinase insert domain receptor (also known as VEGF 
receptor-2 [VEGFR-2]). Neutralizing the biological activity of VEGF inhibits the formation of new tumour 
vasculature, causes regression in newly-formed tumour vasculature, and normalises the remaining tumour 
vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumour growth. 
The applicant applied for the same therapeutic indications for MYL-1402O as granted for Avastin in the EU. 
Abevmy is intended for the treatment of carcinoma of the colon or rectum, breast cancer, non-small cell lung 
cancer, renal cell cancer, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, and carcinoma of the 
cervix (see section 1). The recommended posology and method of administration correspond to those of 
Avastin. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Abevmy has been developed as biosimilar to the reference medicinal product Avastin (EMA product number 
EMEA/H/C/000582). The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 25 
mg/mL of bevacizumab as active substance. The product is supplied in two presentations, i.e. 100 mg /4 mL 
and 400 mg/16 mL in single-use vials (6 mL (6R) and 20 mL, respectively). 
Other ingredients are: α,α-trehalose dihydrate, sodium phosphate (E339), polysorbate 20 (E432) and water 
for injections.

The product is available in Type I glass vials closed with a flurotec coated, chlorobutyl rubber stopper and 
sealed with an aluminium seal with plastic flip-off cap. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance (AS) of Abevmy (also referred to as MYL-1402O) is bevacizumab (INN), a recombinant 
humanised IgG1 humanised monoclonal antibody which selectively binds to vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) on the surface of 
endothelial cells, thus inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and VEGF-induced vascular 
permeability. 
The active substance is expressed in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells (CHO-S cell line) and contains two 
identical heavy chains (HC) and two identical light chains (LC). The heavy and light chains are connected by 
intra- and interchain disulphide bonds. MYL-1402O has an approximate molecular weight of 149 kDa and has 
one N-linked Glycosylation site located on the heavy chain at Asparagine 303 (Asn-303).  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturers 
The active substance manufacture, quality control testing are performed at Biocon Biologics India Limited in 
Bengaluru, India (Bommasandra-Jigani Link Road).  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls  
The active substance is manufactured using a fed-batch process in a production bioreactor. Following cell 
culture and harvest, active substance is purified from the harvest culture fluid through a series of filtration 
and chromatography steps. The process includes steps to inactive/remove potential containing viruses. 
Excipients are added to generate the formulated active substance. 
Process control classifications and acceptance ranges are considered acceptable. The process parameters are 
controlled by acceptable ranges. All operations from the thawing of the vial until the harvest from the 
production bioreactor are performed aseptically. All gases are filter-sterilised. Feed solutions, which are 
added to the production bioreactor, are filter-sterilised. The hold times for the AS process intermediates have 
been adequately validated. Tables with the main operational parameters, their classification, and acceptable 
ranges for the individual steps were provided. The parameters were classified into critical process parameter 
(CPP) and non-critical process parameter (NCPP) based on process characterisation studies. CPP are 
controlled by in-process control (IPC) testing.  
Overall, the process parameters and IPCs with the other control measures are considered sufficient to ensure 
quality and safety of MYL-1402O as well as to monitor process consistency. 
Control of materials 
The raw materials used during the production of MYL-1402O AS are either of compendial or non-compendial 
quality. Non-compendial raw materials are tested according to in-house specification. The composition of the 
cell culture media, feed solutions and buffers used during purification is described in detail.  
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 11/125 
 
 
 
The history and stability of the host cell line has been well established. Bevacizumab amino acid sequence for 
the heavy and light chain was confirmed in comparison with that of the reference medicinal product. The 
construction of the expression vectors and their genetic elements are described in sufficient detail. A two-
tiered cell bank system with Master Cell Bank (MCB)/Working Cell Bank (WCB) has been established by the 
applicant. The MCB and WCB have been adequately described; they have been qualified and characterised in 
line with ICH Q5D guideline. An end of production cell bank (EPCB) and a post-production cell bank (PPCB) 
were prepared and tested according to ICH Q5A and ICH Q5D. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The  input  CPPs  have  been  defined  during  process  characterisation.  These  CPPs  were  validated  using  three 
batches. IPCs are performed at each stage during the manufacture of AS to ensure that the process is controlled 
to yield consistent product quality. 
All IPCs and tests of the active substance manufacturing process were provided; the critical IPCs with respective 
limits  and  justifications  are  summarised  in  section  3.2.S.2.4.  Either  acceptance  criteria  or  action  limits  are 
proposed for the IPCs.  
Overall, the proposed controls appear adequate to ensure consistent quality of the MYL-1402O AS. IPC tests 
have been sufficiently described and validated. In-process data for the Process Performance Qualification 
(PPQ) batches was presented; all batches met the specifications. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
Performance of the AS manufacturing process was verified at commercial site and scale using three consecutive 
process validation batches. 
The data from process validation was assessed with the proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and manufacturing 
operating range (MORs) obtained from process characterisation studies. 
The validation results, which were all within their specified acceptance criteria, demonstrate that the process 
performs consistently and delivers AS complying with the release specifications under commercial operating 
conditions.  
Validation also includes buffer preparation, details of clearance of process-and product related impurities, at-
scale hold time studies, Chromatographic column resin and TFF membrane reusability studies, extractable 
and leachable evaluation for critical product contact materials. Extractables/leachables studies were 
conducted for critical product contact materials. A tabulated summary of identified critical product contact 
materials has been provided. No elemental impurities above the limit of quantification were observed. Two 
compounds with potential leachable exposure above the safety concern threshold were further assessed 
based on extractable data. The conducted toxicological assessment confirmed that the potential leachables do 
not impact patient safety.  
No formal shipping validation has been performed for the MYL-1402O. This is deemed acceptably justified 
considering the applied procedures and the AS and finished product facilities locations. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development of Bevacizumab active substance was initially based on a 
manufacturing process which was then optimised to the commercial process. Changes introduced during 
scale-up and among the different versions for the process (development process and commercial process) 
have been explained and justified.

A comparability study has been carried on pre- and post-change batches according to ICHQ5E, and data 
provided demonstrated that the change did not have impact on the process performance and quality of the 
product. 
Comprehensive process characterisation (PC) studies have been performed and based on the results the 
process parameters were classified with respect to their criticality. The scaled-down model used for these 
studies was qualified and representative of the at scale manufacturing process. 
Characterisation 
A range of state-of-the-art orthogonal methods has been employed to characterise the active substance. The 
primary structure, higher order structures, and the biological activity were evaluated using a series of 
biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterisation techniques. The methods were qualified or validated 
(release testing methods). 
Characterisation was performed using active substance manufactured at commercial scale by the final 
commercial manufacturing process. In the scope of the biosimilar exercise, the primary, secondary, and 
higher order structure, glycosylation patterns, product-related variants, and functional activity of MYL-1402O 
have been characterised side-by-side against the US and EU reference product Avastin (see also biosimilarity 
section).  
For the primary structural analysis, the amino acid composition of MYL-1402O was determined by peptide 
mapping (LC ESI-MS). The average molecular mass was determined by intact and reduced LC-ESI-MS.  
The higher order structure was evaluated by a combination of Fourier transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) 
Far- and Near-UV Circular Dichroism and Intrinsic Fluorescene.  MYL-1402O contains a total of 16 disulfide 
bonds: 12 intra-chain disulfide bonds and 4 inter-chain disulfides bonds. Disulfide linkages were found to be 
identical for MYL-1402O and the reference medicinal product Avastin. 
The glycan profile of MYL-1402O was determined by normal phase HPLC (NP-HPLC). In addition, an O-Glycan 
analysis using NP-HPLC has been conducted.  
To estimate the content of N-acetyl neuraminic acid (NeuAc/NANA), Sialic acid analysis has been performed. 
Charge and size variants were determined using complementary analytical methods (IEX, cIEF and CE-SDS 
(reduced and non-reduced), reduced peptide map and SEC).  
The biological characterisation included in vitro functional assessments of Fab and Fc regions. The biological 
characterisation included binding to VEGF165 by ELISA and functional activity in a cell-based assay (HUVEC 
anti-proliferation assay). Fc binding assays include FcγRIIIa-V158 and FcRn binding by SPR, and C1q binding 
by ELISA.  
Characterisation was done using batches that have been manufactured using active substance from the 
intended commercial active substance process. In summary, the presented data confirm the expected 
structural and functional characteristics of bevacizumab.  
Impurities 
Process related impurities arising during upstream and downstream manufacturing processes include host cell 
proteins (HCP), host cell DNA, leached protein A and media/buffer components. Data presented for the three 
PPQ runs in the scope of the process validation studies demonstrate that the process consistently and 
effectively removes HCP, host cell DNA, and leached protein A to very low levels (below quantitation limit). 
A detailed control strategy of product-related impurities for commercial batches was provided and is deemed 
satisfactory.

Overall, MYL-1402O has been sufficiently characterised; the used methods are adequate. 
Specification 
The proposed set of quality attributes included in the specifications for release and stability testing of 
bevacizumab complies with ICH Q6B, Ph. Eur. 2031 and EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008 and is acceptable. 
The release specification includes tests for appearance, identity, purity and impurities, process-related 
impurities, quantity, potency, microbial safety, and general attributes.  
For all internal methods, reference is made to the same Standard testing procedure document. Each method 
is expected to have a specific code. Therefore, the respective internal reference code of the single method 
should be added (REC). 
Relevant methods have been demonstrated to be stability-indicating in forced degradation and stress studies. 
It is noted that the potency seems not to be stability-indicating. 
The glycosylation profile of the AS has been extensively characterised. The mode of action for bevacizumab 
justifies omitting a comprehensive glycosylation study from the specifications. 
The CHMP requested the applicant to revise the specification for potency after a total of 30 AS batches used 
for commercial finished product batches will be available (REC).  
Analytical Methods 
The in-house analytical methods were sufficiently described and validated. However the CHMP requested the 
serial numbers to the respective in-house methods listed in the specification and reference the Standard 
testing procedure to be provided and added to the specification table (REC). For compendial methods 
(Colour, Clarity/Opalescence, Bacterial Endotoxin, Bioburden, pH, Osmolality) reference to the respective Ph. 
Eur. monograph has been provided. 
Satisfactory  bridging  data  has  been  provided  for  the  two  methods,  HCP  and  leached  protein  A,  which  have 
changed in the course of development. 
Potency is controlled by a cell-based assay that measures inhibition of proliferation (HUVEC cells). The anti-
proliferation effect of MYL-1402O on HUVEC is evaluated using a fluorescent dye. This inhibition is compared 
to an internal reference standard.  
Reference Standards 
A historical overview of the reference standards was presented. Detailed information on the current and 
previous reference standard lots has been provided. A two-tier system of primary reference standard and 
secondary reference standard will be established for MYL-1402O AS and finished product. The protocol for 
establishment and monitoring of the Secondary Reference Standard was provided.  
Batch analysis data 
Applicant has provided batch data for several active substance lots from different versions of the 
manufacturing processes. These are the batches used in the non-clinical studies, clinical studies, stability 
studies and process validation studies. The results were within the predefined specifications in place at the 
time of testing and confirm consistency of manufacturing process. 
Container closure 
The formulated bulk AS is stored in single-use, sterile bag. A description of the container closure system has 
been provided, including the identity of materials of construction of each primary packaging component.

Stability 
The  proposed  shelf-life  of  active  substance  is  based  on  long-term  primary  stability  data  (real-time, 
recommended storage conditions) generated from commercial scale batches from both the development and 
the commercial process.  
Stability data for three batches from the commercial process stored under long-term conditions for 18 
months and under accelerated conditions for up to 6 months, as per ICH guidelines were provided. 
Supportive stability data was provided for ten commercial scale development batches. Stability data from 
samples stored under long-term for up to 36 months and for up to 6 months at accelerated conditions were 
presented.  
Furthermore, stability data were presented from three developmental batches. For these batches long-term 
stability data for 24 months and for six months under accelerated conditions are available. In addition, stress 
stability data are available up to 1 month.   
All batches were manufactured at Biocon facility located in India and stored in representative container 
closures.  
Overall, the parameters tested are as per the tests in the release specification. Process-related impurities, 
primary sequence and microbial attributes are not part of the stability programme, which is acceptable. 
All the stability results provided for the different processes were within specifications and no significant 
trending has been observed. The available stability data for samples stored at the recommended storage 
conditions show good stability. Under accelerated conditions a slight decrease in purity is observed. 
Furthermore, purity is slightly decreasing; total impurities increase. 
The stability data presented from the development process can be considered representative for the 
commercial process. Given the high comparability between the manufacturing processes, the proposed shelf-
life based on the development process is acceptable.  
The applicant should present the real time data obtained for the three primary stability AS batches 
manufactured at commercial scale using the commercial process as soon as available and report any out of 
specification value found during the stability studies for these primary stability batches will be immediately 
communicated to the Agency (REC). 
Overall, the provided stability data support a proposed shelf-life at the recommended storage condition for 
bevacizumab active substance in the proposed container closure system. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product (FP) is a sterile, preservative-free clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale brown 
concentrate for solution for infusion in a single dose vial for intravenous use containing 25 mg/mL of 
bevacizumab as active substance and is supplied in two presentations: 100 mg/ 4 mL and 400 mg/ 16 mL 
single-use vials. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 15/125 
 
 
 
Bevacizumab is formulated with trehalose dihydrate, sodium phosphate (as monobasic sodium phosphate 
dihydrate and as dibasic sodium phosphate anhydrous), polysorbate 20 and water for injections.  
The excipients used in Abevmy 100 mg/4 mL and 400 mg/16 mL formulation are standard pharmacopoeial 
excipients commonly used in intravenous formulations. The formulation is identical to that of the reference 
medicinal product. The compatibility of the AS with the used excipients has been shown in stability studies. 
Minor formulation changes between early (initial formulation) and late (final formulation) development phase 
studies have been described and explained. A comparability assessment has been performed to assess the 
impact of the formulation changes. Overall, the applicant concluded that the changes do not have any impact 
on the quality of the product. However, a slightly higher pH and reduced osmolality can be observed. Since 
the values are still within the release specifications, the issue was not further pursued. The MYL-1402O 
400 mg/16 mL formulation was developed with the same molar composition as the 100 mg presentation 
based on the “Final formulation”.  
There is no overage in the manufacturing process. The vials are filled to ensure a deliverable volume of 4 mL 
for the 100 mg presentation and 16 mL for the 400 mg presentation. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process of Abevmy 100 mg/vial and 400 mg/vial involves thawing of AS, pre-filtration, 
sterile filtration, aseptic filling of the formulated AS and sealing of vials containing liquid FP. 
Changes made to the finished product manufacturing process during the development have been described 
and explained. 
The batch history was provided for process development together with the implemented changes. An 
overview of the FP manufacturing process development from initial development through the intended 
commercial process for the 100 mg/vial and 400 mg/vial was provided. 
There are no differences in the manufacturing process and controls between 100 mg/vial and 400 mg/vial 
except for the fill volume and vial size.  
A  comparability  studies  has  been  performed  for  change  in  filling  line  according  to  ICH  Q5E;  although  the 
approach chosen to show similarity is rather liberal, the actual results of the comparability exercise do not raise 
any  concerns  and  is  thus  acceptable.  The  comparability  assessment  indicates  that  batches  derived  from 
different filling lines are comparable. 
Container closure system 
The primary container closure system for Abevmy 100 mg/4 mL and 400 mg/16 mL consists of a Type I glass 
vial (6R for 100 mg and 20 mL for 400 mg presentation) closed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper (20 mm) 
coated with a fluoro-resin laminate. The rubber stopper is sealed with an aluminium cap with a plastic flip-off 
cap. The glass vial and rubber stopper comply with the appropriate Ph. Eur. monographs for primary 
containers and closures.  
Extractables and leachables were also assessed. Overall, the results from the leachable and extractable 
studies demonstrate that the components of the container closure system are compatible with the FP and 
confirm its suitability for the storage of Abevmy finished product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Finished product manufacture, quality control testing (physico-chemical and biological functional) are 
performed at Biocon Biologics India Limited in Bengaluru, India.  
Abevmy is manufactured according to a standard manufacturing process (fill-and-finish) for monoclonal 
antibodies. The process comprises the following main steps: 1) Thawing of formulated AS, 2) Pooling of 
formulated AS followed by mixing, 3) Prefiltration (offline filtration), 4) Sterile filtration (online filtration), 
aseptic filling, and stoppering of vials, 5) Sealing, visual inspection, and labeling, and 6) Storage of vials and 
shipment. 
The manufacturing process for Abevmy concentrate for solution for infusion consists of a standard aseptic 
manufacturing process and is controlled by IPC testing performed during manufacture. The process has been 
adequately described. 
Corresponding in-process-results for the three consecutive commercial scale process validation batches were 
provided. The results of all batches were found to be consistent and within the acceptance criteria. The 
control strategy for critical process steps is considered adequate. 
There are no intermediates in the FP manufacturing process. The maximum duration of filtration is supported 
by the maximum duration of media fill simulations. The time out of refrigeration (TOR), i.e. the maximum 
allowable processing time at temperatures above the recommended storage temperature from the end of 
filling to the end of secondary packaging, has been indicated.  
Process validation 
Prior to the process validation studies, risk assessment and process characterisation studies were conducted 
in order to define process parameters and their effective ranges.  
The manufacturing process has been validated by manufacture of an appropriate number of full-scale 
commercial batches for the 100mg/4 mL and 400 mg/16 mL vial presentations. 
All process parameters, as well as performance parameters, monitored during the process validation studies 
were maintained within their specific ranges for all process validation batches. Based on the data provided, it 
can be concluded that the process is robust and consistently delivers finished product of the anticipated 
quality. Ranges have been studied and defined during process characterisation studies and are considered 
justified. None of the ranges was challenged during process validation. 
The glass vials are sterilised and depyrogenated prior to use by dry heat sterilisation by using a validated 
process. The rubber stoppers are supplied ready to use. 
Filter validation 
The validation of the filters used for bioburden reduction and sterilisation of the finished product solution is 
conducted. All results complied with the predetermined acceptance criteria and verify that the filters are 
appropriate for filtering finished product volumes. 
Media fills 
The aseptic process used for the sterilisation has been validated through media fills. 
Finally, successful cleaning validation on parts of equipment that come into direct contact with the FP and 
transport validation using the proposed commercial primary and secondary packaging configuration covering 
an actual shipment of a currently proposed worst-case shipping route has been presented.

Product specification 
The specification for the finished product includes tests for appearance, identity, purity and impurities, 
quantity, potency, general attributes and microbial safety. 
Both the FP presentations (100 mg/ 4 mL and 400 mg/ 16 mL) have identical specifications with an only 
exception to acceptance criteria for extractable volume, which is specific for each presentation due to 
difference in their fill volume. 
The panel of quality attributes proposed for release and stability testing of Abevmy finished product is 
considered adequate and in line with ICH Q6B, EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008 guideline, and Ph. Eur. 2031. 
The specification limits have been adequately justified taking into account data from AS and the reference 
medicinal product Avastin as well as Abevmy batch analysis data and stability data.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment and 
elemental analysis results of three commercial scale MYL-1402O PV batches, it is confirmed that elemental 
impurities are within the limits set out in ICH Q3D and that testing for elemental impurities does not need to 
be included in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is 
satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified 
on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. 
Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
Analytical methods 
For the in-house analytical methods, the descriptions are sufficiently detailed and acceptable. However, the 
CHMP requested the serial numbers to the respective in-house methods listed in the specification and 
reference the Standard testing procedure to be provided and added to the specification table (REC). All 
analytical methods used for release testing of the FP have been appropriately validated based on the 
principles provided in ICH Q2 (R1) guideline. For compendial methods reference to the respective Ph. Eur. 
monograph has been provided. The methods have been verified. The analytical procedures used for bacterial 
endotoxin, sterility, and container closure integrity test have been validated for the MYL-1402O FP to 
determine their suitability. The presented validations for analytical methods are acceptable and demonstrate 
the suitability of the analytical procedures for their intended use.  
For the release of the commercial product, there has been a change in the analytical method for identity. A 
method comparability assessment was done with the existing and new reagents for bevacizumab FP samples. 
Both methods with old and new reagent exhibited positive identity with respect to standard and samples. 
Reference Standards 
Detailed information on the current and previous reference standard lots has been provided and discussed 
previously in the respective AS section in this report.  
Batch Analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 18/125 
 
 
 
 
The  applicant  has  provided  batch  data  for  several  100  mg  and  400  mg  finished  product  lots  from  different 
versions of the manufacturing processes. These are the batches used in the development studies, non-clinical 
studies, clinical studies, stability studies and process validation studies. 
The available results demonstrate that the manufacturing process(es) are capable of delivering FP of consistent 
quality. Batches derived from the different developmental phases are comparable. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed long-term storage condition for Abevmy (100 mg/4mL and 400 mg/16 mL vial presentations) is 
5 ± 3 °C. A shelf-life of 24 months is proposed, based on long-term primary stability data (real-time, 
recommended storage conditions.  
For the 100 mg/4 mL and 400 mg/16 mL vial presentations long-term stability data for three PPQ batches 
each are available up to 12 months for 100 mg/4 mL and for 400 mg/16 mL. Stability data at accelerated 
conditions (25 ± 2 °C/60% ± 5% RH) are available up to 6 months.  
Supportive stability data for the 100 mg/4 mL vial presentation was provided for nine batches manufactured 
at previous filling line using AS from development process. Long-term stability data are available for up to 36 
months. Stability data at accelerated conditions are available up to 6 months. Additionally, for the three 
batches, stability data are available at stress conditions (40 ± 2°C/75% ± 5% RH) for 2 months. 
Furthermore, stability data were presented for three developmental batches. Long-term stability data at the 
recommended storage condition are available for 36 months and at accelerated conditions for 6 months; 
stress stability data (40 ± 2°C/75% ± 5% RH) for these batches are available up to 2 months. 
Supportive stability data for the 400 mg/16 mL vial presentation was provided for ten batches manufactured 
at previous filling line using AS from development process using AS from development process. Long-term 
stability data are available for up to 36 months and at accelerated conditions for up to 6 months. No stability 
data at stress conditions are available for these batches but data from a forced degradation study were 
presented. 
The design of the registration stability studies was in line with ICH Q5C guideline. Overall, the parameters 
tested as per the tests in the release specification. All PPQ batches, for both presentations, were 
manufactured at the proposed site and stored in the containers intended for commercial use. For the stability 
studies the vials are stored in horizontal position. 
For the stability data provided for the different processes, all results were within specifications. The available 
stability data for samples stored at the recommended storage conditions (5 ± 3°C) show a trending for the 
purity/impurities parameters. A slight decrease of purity is observed. The trending is visible after 6 months 
for the PPQ batches. For the supportive and developmental batches, the trending can also be observed – 
however further specifics cannot be made since some of the parameters are not tested for these batches. The 
batches remain within specifications for the proposed shelf-life of 24 months. Under accelerated conditions 
(25 ± 2°C/60% ± 5% RH), an obvious decrease in purity can be observed. Potency is still within limits. Only 
at stressed (40 ± 2°C/75% ± 5% RH) conditions, a clear signal for potency is observed. 
For the batches filled in the previous filling line some analytical methods parameters are different compared 
to the (commercial) batches; differences have been discussed. Since the analytical methods per se remain 
identical and the main parameters have always been determined, this issue can be accepted. The data has 
also been generated for the “missing” parameters and support the specifications.  
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021

Given the high comparability between both the FP from the previous and proposed filling lines and the AS 
manufacturing processes, it can be acceptable to claim a shelf-life of 24 months based on product batches 
manufactured at previous filling line  that are derived from AS from the development process. The 
manufacturing process at the previous filling line can be considered representative for the commercial 
process. The CHMP requested the applicant to present up to 24 months real time data obtained for the three 
commercial scale batches of MYL-1402O FP 100 mg and 400 mg presentations as soon as available and 
report any out of specification value found during the ongoing stability study for the commercial scale 
batches of MYL-1402O FP 100 mg and 400 mg presentations should be immediately communicated to the 
agency (REC). 
Stability comparability has been evaluated for the two presentations 100 mg/vial and 400 mg/vial at real-
time long-term storage condition of 2-8°C. Stability-indicating parameters were evaluated. Overall stability 
profiles for MYL-1402O 100 mg/vial and 400 mg/vial presentations were found comparable. 
A comparative forced degradation study using both MYL-1402O and the reference medicinal product Avastin 
has been conducted. Overall, the results were similar for biosimilar MYL-1402O product and the reference 
medicinal product Avastin. 
A photostability study in line with ICH Q1B guideline has been conducted and the study showed that FP is 
light sensitive. Upon photo exposure a significant degradation in the samples were observed. 
A compatibility study was conducted to evaluate the stability of finished product after dilution.  
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at 2°C to 30°C in sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. If not used immediately, the diluted Abevmy should not be stored 
longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user 
and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled 
and validated aseptic conditions (SmPC section 6.3). 
Taken together, the presented stability data sufficiently support the proposed shelf-life of 2 years at the 
intended storage conditions (i.e. 2-8°C, protected from light) as per SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4.  
Biosimilarity  
Analytical similarity of MYL-1402O was assessed in a comprehensive similarity exercise using EU- and US-
sourced Avastin as reference medicinal product. US-sourced Avastin was included as supportive data. The 
approach and methodology of the analytical similarity assessment is sufficiently described and overall 
acceptable.  
The number of batches of EU-Approved Avastin and US-Licensed Avastin as well as of Abevmy were 
considered adequate for the analytical similarity assessment. To support the known mechanism of action, 
binding to VEGF and inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by functional and binding assays in the scope 
of the biosimilarity exercise. Assays include binding to VEGF (VEGF-165 and VEGF-121 and VEGF-189), 
inhibition of VEGF (VEGF-165, VEGF-121 and VEGF-189) induced proliferation of endothelial cells (HUVECs), 
and inhibition of VEGF-165 induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. Information on “standard test procedure” and 
method qualification are provided. From the information provided, it can be concluded that MYL1402O is 
similar to the European reference medicinal product in terms of VEGF-binding, inhibition of VEGF induced 
proliferation of endothelial cells and inhibition of VEGF-165 induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. MYL-1402O 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 20/125 
 
 
 
showed minor difference when compared to US- and EU-Avastin lots for VEGF-121 binding kinetics (KD). The 
differences in kinetic constants observed are within the method variability. Furthermore, the inhibition of 
VEGF-121 induced HUVEC proliferation shows similarity. Therefore, this issue does not preclude similarity. 
In addition to Fab-associated antigen binding, MYL1402O binding to Fc receptors and complement factor C1q 
were evaluated in the scope of the biosimilarity exercise using in vitro assays. C1q binding was assessed via 
ELISA and binding kinetics with FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIIb and FcRn were assessed via 
surface plasmon resonance. Furthermore, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement 
dependent cytotoxicity assays were included as part of the comparability exercise - even though 
bevacizumab is not known to act through either of these mechanisms. From the information provided, it can 
be concluded that MYL1402O is similar to the European reference medicinal product in terms of Fc receptor 
and C1q binding. No ADCC or CDC activity could be detected. Some observed differences in FcγRIIIb and 
FcRnare small and do not preclude biosimilarity. 
In conclusion, the similarity assessment of MYL-1402O and the EU reference medicinal product showed highly 
similar biological activity of both the Fab and Fc-based functionality.  
For protein concentration – as measured by UV spectrophotometry, one MYL-1402O batch was found to 
contain lower concentration of bevacizumab. The protein concentration value of this batch was however 
within the current release and stability specifications.  
With regard to purity/impurities, as measured by SEC, MYL-1402O lots were found to contain lower amounts 
of HMWP and higher content of monomer compared to EU-Approved Avastin and US-Licensed Avastin lots. No 
impact on PK was observed in the comparative PK study compared to the US-Licensed Avastin. There was no 
impact of higher monomer content on the inhibition of VEGF165 induced proliferation assay. No impact on 
safety and efficacy was observed during the comparative clinical study. Therefore, MYL-1402O is considered 
similar for HMWP and monomer. 
Differences were also observed for fragments and the distribution of charged variants.  The total impurity 
content and the monomer content of MYL-1402O were within the quality ranges of EU-Approved Avastin and 
US-Licensed Avastin. Overall, the differences in fragments showed no effect on the relative potency and 
binding kinetics data in different Fab and Fc function assays. Furthermore, no apparent impact on safety, 
efficacy and immunogenicity was seen in the Phase III comparative safety and efficacy study (MYL-1402O-
3001). 
Differences were observed in the content of basic and main peak between MYL-1402O and the reference 
medicinal product lots. No impact on PK was observed in the comparative PK study MYL-1402O- 1002 which 
used a MYL-1402O lot compared to the US-Licensed Avastin. There was no impact of lower basic and higher 
main peak content on the inhibition of VEGF165 induced HUVEC proliferation assay. The lower basic peak and 
higher main peak in MYL-1402O lots is not considered to have an impact on potency, PK, safety, efficacy and 
immunogenicity and MYL- 1402O is considered similar to EU-Approved Avastin and US-Licensed Avastin for 
the charge variants. 
Oxidation levels observed in MYL-1402O lots were comparable and any reported differences have not been 
ranked as critical and essential in demonstrating analytical similarity. The non-glycosylated heavy chain 
(NGHC) was lower and outside the quality range for MYL-1402O batches. NGHC levels are reported to impact 
efficacy through Fc effector functions (CDC and ADCC); antibodies with high levels of NGHC have significantly 
reduced effector functions. Since Fc effector functions are not part of the mechanism of action for 
Bevacizumab, and no differences in C1q and FcγRIIIa binding has been observed, this aspect is not 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 21/125 
 
 
 
considered relevant for overall biosimilarity. In the comparative phase III clinical study, no apparent impact 
on safety, efficacy and immunogenicity was seen. 
Higher levels of high mannose species have been observed for MYL-1402O batches compared to the 
reference medicinal product. High mannose levels may result in faster clearance of the FP in vivo and 
therefore may affect the PK. However, no impact on PK was observed in the comparative PK study which 
used a MYL-1402O batch with higher levels of mannose compared to the US-Licensed Avastin. Additionally, 
high mannose species are reported to enhance ADCC activity. Since ADCC is not part of the mechanism of 
action of bevacizumab, this aspect is not regarded relevant for overall biosimilarity. 
Furthermore, higher levels were observed for terminal galactose and total afucosylated species (with and 
without high mannose). Lower levels were observed for fucosylated species. Galactosylation, afucosylation 
and fucosylation have been reported to be relevant for Fc mediated effector functions including CDC, ADCC, 
and FcγRIIIa binding. However, ADCC/CDC is not part of the mechanism of action for bevacizumab and no 
difference was observed in FcγRIIIa binding. Therefore, the differences are not regarded relevant in terms of 
overall biosimilarity. 
Higher levels of total sialic acid (NANA) are observed in MYL-1402O batches compared to EU-Approved 
Avastin and US-Licensed Avastin lots. NANA levels are reported to impact PK, CDC and ADCC. In the 
comparative PK study and the phase III comparative safety and efficacy study, a MYL-1402O batch with 
higher levels of total sialic acid compared to the reference medicinal product was used. No impact on PK, 
safety, efficacy and immunogenicity was seen, so far. Furthermore, since Fc effector functions are not part of 
the mechanism of action for Bevacizumab, and no differences in C1q and FcγRIIIa binding has been 
observed, this aspect is not considered relevant for overall biosimilarity. 
Overall, it is concluded that the minor differences in the levels of aggregates, fragments, charged species and 
the glycosylation pattern observed for MYL-1402O would have no impact on PK, activity, safety and 
immunogenicity. 
The presented analytical data support the claim for biosimilarity between the proposed biosimilar MYL-1402O 
and the reference product EU-Avastin. MYL-1402O is regarded similar to its reference medicinal product. The 
results are summarised in Table 1.

Adventitious agents 
Overall, the risk of contamination of MYL-1402O with adventitious agents is considered low. The applicant 
implemented multiple complementing measures to ensure product safety with regard to non-viral and viral 
adventitious agents. The measures include selection of materials, testing of cell banks and process 
intermediates (bulk), testing of microbial attributes at release, and implementation and validation of 
dedicated virus clearance steps and steps contributing to virus reduction:  
• 
For the production cell culture process of MYL-1402O, except two raw materials, no other animal- or 
human-derived material is used. Due to the manufacturing steps there is no specific concern for viral 
contamination. Compliance with TSE-Guideline EMEA/410/01 rev03 has been demonstrated. There 
are three animal-derived raw materials that were used in the various stages of stable cell line 
development. The risk from these animal-derived raw materials used at development of the MCB is 
considered by extensive testing of MCB. No excipients of human and/or animal origin are used in the 
manufacture of finished product. 
•  Cells have been tested for adventitious and endogenous viruses according to ICH Q5A and human 
viruses and Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR). 
• 
The testing programme for the un-processed bulk is compliant with Guideline ICH Q5A and 
acceptable. Considering the data from multiple tested lots and overall viral clearance capacity it could 
also be justified to abandon retrovirus testing and RCR testing from the routine testing programme. 
•  Endotoxin levels and bioburden/sterility are adequately controlled throughout the manufacturing 
process and at active substance and finished product release. 
• 
 New and aged chromatographic resins were assessed with regard to viral particle contamination and 
sufficiently wide safety margin has been demonstrated. 
The ability of the purification process to remove viruses was evaluated with a suitable panel of model viruses. 
The choice of model viruses and selection of process steps validated for virus reduction is acceptable. The 
viral clearance study was performed. Validation studies for virus inactivation/removal were performed. Full

study reports on virus inactivation/removal have been provided. Controls for cytotoxicity and interference of 
test material with virus detection were performed. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The data provided support biosimilarity versus the EU reference 
medicinal product (Avastin) at the quality level. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the below aspects and are put forward and agreed 
as recommendations for future quality development: 
▪ 
to review the acceptance criteria for potency based on a total 30 AS batches used for commercial 
FP batches. 
▪ 
to present real time stability data for commercial scale and commercial process AS batches and 
report any out of specification results. 
▪ 
to present real time stability data for commercial scale and commercial process FP batches and 
report any out of specification. 
▪ 
to provide the serial numbers to the respective in-house methods for the control of AS and add 
them to the table in section S.4.1 in Module 3. 
▪ 
To provide the serial numbers to the respective in-house methods for the control of FP and add 
them to table in section P.5.1 in Module 3. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  to review the acceptance criteria for potency based on a total 30 AS batches used for commercial FP 
batches 
2.  to present real time stability data for commercial scale and commercial process AS batches and report 
any out of specification results. 
3.  to present real time stability data for commercial scale and commercial process FP batches and report

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Bevacizumab is a recombinant IgG1 humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to soluble VEGF (VEGF-
A) and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) on the surface of endothelial 
cells, thus inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and VEGF-induced vascular permeability.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The MYL-1402O pharmacology programme was focused on the evaluation of analytical similarity compared to 
the reference medicinal product (EU-Avastin) (Table 2). In vitro studies were included in Module 3, therefore 
the  assessment  can  be  found  in  the  quality  part,  section  2.2.3  of  this  report.  No  in  vivo  non-clinical 
pharmacology studies were conducted. 
A short summary of the in vitro assays is provided in the sections below.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Pharmacological in vitro assays with MYL1402O, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin included binding to VEGF (VEGF-
165 and VEGF-121 and VEGF-189), inhibition of VEGF (VEGF-165, VEGF-121 and VEGF-189) induced 
proliferation of endothelial cells (HUVECs), and inhibition of VEGF-165 induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. 
From the information provided, it can be concluded that MYL1402O is similar to the European reference 
medicinal product in terms of VEGF-binding, inhibition of VEGF induced proliferation of endothelial cells and 
inhibition of VEGF-165 induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In addition to Fab-associated antigen binding, MYL1402O binding to Fc receptors and complement factor C1q 
were evaluated in the scope of the biosimilarity exercise using in vitro assays. C1q binding was assessed via 
ELISA and binding kinetics with FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIIb and FcRn were assessed via 
surface plasmon resonance. Furthermore, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement 
dependent cytotoxicity assays were included as part of the comparability exercise - even though 
bevacizumab is not known to act through either of these mechanisms. 
From the information provided, it can be concluded that MYL1402O is similar to the European reference 
medicinal product in terms of Fc receptor and C1q binding. No ADCC or CDC activity could be detected. 
MYL1402O shows a slightly lower FcγRIIIb binding activity and a slightly higher C1q binding activity. 
In comparison with the EU-and US-reference medicinal product, a broader distribution for FcRn binding can 
be observed for the proposed biosimilar. The results are still within the range of EU-Avastin. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No stand-alone pharmacokinetics studies were submitted. However, the toxicokinetics of MYL-1402O and 
Avastin-US were compared in a repeat-dose toxicity study (Study TOX-070-002) performed in cynomolgus 
monkeys and additional toxicokinetic data for an older version of MYL-1402O (namely Bmab-100) were 
collected in two supportive studies conducted in mice and rabbits (Study 9335 and Study 9340, respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 28/125 
 
 
 
 
 
The supportive repeat-dose study in mice was comparative in nature and showed a similar toxicokinetic 
profile of Bmab-100 and Avastin at the dosage of 50 mg/kg on day 1. At day 29, a difference in exposure 
was observed, which might be due to variable immunogenicity owing to repeated administration of Bmab-100 
and Avastin. ADAs have not been determined in this study.  
The supportive repeat-dose study in rabbits was not comparative. The toxicokinetic profile of Bmab-100 
resembles the profile of a typical monoclonal antibody. Accumulation occurred at repeated dosing.  
The supportive repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study TOX-070-002) was comparative in nature 
and showed a similar toxicokinetic profile of MYL-1402O and Avastin at the dosage of 50 mg/kg. The 
biosimilarity ratio (MYL-1402O/Avastin) for C0 was between 0.7 and 1.2 and the ratio for AUC0-24 was 
between 1.0 and 1.3. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Two acute toxicity studies were conducted with Bmab-100 (an older version of MYL-1402O) in Swiss Albino 
mice (Study 9336) and New Zealand White rabbits (Study 9337). No significant toxicities were observed in 
either study. There were no signs of toxicity, pathological changes or mortality. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Four repeat dose toxicity studies were conducted with the proposed biosimilar (MYL-1402O) (Table 3).

Reproduction Toxicity 
No developmental or reproductive toxicology studies were conducted with MYL-1402O. However, within the 
repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (TOX-070-002), a reduction in uterus gland size in treated 
female animals was observed with both Avastin and MYL-1402O.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, bevacizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
For global development, the toxicological profile of the proposed biosimilar candidate was determined in 
several in vivo acute and repeat-dose studies in mice, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys.  
No toxicities were observed in the conducted single-dose toxicity studies in mice and rabbits. The conducted 
single dose toxicity studies in mice and rabbits are not considered relevant for demonstration of biosimilarity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 30/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, it is not recommended to conduct separate single-dose studies (see ICH M3 guideline), or toxicity 
studies with monoclonal antibodies in non-relevant animal species, i.e. mice (see ICH S6 guideline). 
In the repeat-dose studies, no unexpected toxicities have been observed. Studies 9335 in mice and TOX-070-
002 in cynomolgus monkeys are comparative and seem to demonstrate biosimilarity of MYL1402O and 
Avastin. However, the group size in these studies is low and inter-individual variability should be considered. 
Furthermore, an older version of MYL-1402O (namely Bmab-100) and US-Avastin were used in the repeat-
dose studies conducted in mice and rabbits (Study 9335 and Study 9340, respectively). The results of the 
studies are regarded supportive and do not add further value for the demonstration of biosimilarity. 
Additionally, a repeat-dose toxicity study has been conducted in rabbits to investigate potential ocular and/or 
systemic toxicity of MYL- 1402O when administered as an intravitreal injection (Study BIO-TX 2561). Since 
the frequency and severity of the observed abnormal ocular clinical signs were similar between test item and 
placebo control groups, the observed ophthalmologic effects were considered independent of the test article. 
The conducted study is not considered relevant for demonstration of biosimilarity. 
ADAs have not been determined within the scope of the repeat-dose toxicity studies and no assay has been 
developed. Since exposure was not changed in the conducted repeat-dose toxicity studies (except for Study 
9335), and animal immunogenicity studies are not relevant in terms of predicting potential immunogenicity of 
human or humanised proteins in humans, this is accepted. 
No genotoxicity studies, carcinogenicity studies and reproductive/developmental toxicity have been 
conducted with MYL-1402O. The waiving is acceptable and in line with relevant guidelines. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In vitro studies are included in Module 3 and the assessment can be found in the quality part of the report.  
For global development, the toxicological profile of the proposed biosimilar candidate was determined in 
several in vivo acute and repeat-dose studies in mice, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. Two of the studies 
are comparative in nature. In a repeat-dose study in mice (Study 9335), Bmab-100 (an older version of MYL-
1402O) was compared to US-Avastin. In a repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys, MYL-1402O and US-
Avastin were compared (Study TOX-070-002).  
Overall, Studies 9335 and TOX-070-002 seem to demonstrate biosimilarity of MYL1402O and Avastin. The 
results of the studies are regarded supportive and do not add further value for the demonstration of 
biosimilarity.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK was characterised in two clinical comparative studies to Avastin. The pivotal phase I study in 
healthy subjects (Study MYL-1402O-1002) was a double-blind, single-dose, three-treatment, parallel 
group design, PK comparability study of MYL-1402O solution manufactured for Mylan compared to US-Avastin 
solution and EU-Avastin solution. The purpose of this study was to assess PK bioequivalence of MYL-1402O to 
Avastin in healthy subjects.

PK evaluation was further supplemented with data from a supportive study in mCRC patients (Study 
BM100-CC-03-I-01). This was a double blind, randomised, active controlled, parallel design, comparative 
PK, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity study of Bmab-100 and Avastin, both in combination with 
oxaliplatin-capecitabine (XELOX) chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 
In addition, the applicant submitted available data from the pivotal confirmatory efficacy and safety 
study in nsNSCLC patients (MYL-1402O-3001). This dossier included efficacy, safety, PK and 
immunogenicity data, which reflect data for the primary efficacy endpoint as well as for safety, population 
pharmacokinetics (PopPK) and immunogenicity. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Detection and quantitation of MYL-1402O and Avastin 
A single ELISA assay using MYL-1402O calibration curve was used for quantitation of MYL-1402O and Avastin 
(EU and US). The performance of the bioanalytical method was demonstrated in the validation carried out in 
accordance with the Guideline on Bioanalytical Method Validation. Intra-assay and inter-assay accuracy and 
precision, selectivity/specificity, sensitivity (LLOQ), dilutional linearity, prozone effect, effect of haemolysis 
and lipemia, VEGF interference and stability tests were carried out. The validations demonstrated that a 
single biosimilar calibration curve can be used for quantitating MYL-1402O, US Avastin and EU Avastin in 
normal and disease-state serum. The validations demonstrated accuracy and precision in normal serum 
within a working range 160.00-2500.00 ng/mL, in NSCLC serum within the working range 320.00-5000.00 
ng/mL, and in mCRC serum within the working range 160.00-2500.00 ng/mL. Stability of bevacizumab was 
evaluated in solutions and in normal and disease-state serum at three levels of QC samples. The short-term 
and freeze/thaw stability results demonstrated that MYL-1402O, EU-Avastin, or US-Avastin were stable under 
defined conditions. The long-term stability data of MYL1402O and EU-Avastin at -80 °C±10 °C or -25°C±5 °C 
were provided and demonstrated sufficient stability of MYL1402O and EU-Avastin in both normal and 
diseased state serum. The values of back-calculated calibration standards, the in-study results of inter-assay 
QC samples accuracy and precision and ISR results demonstrated reliable performance of the method during 
study samples analysis.  
Analysis of anti-MYL-1402O/anti-Avastin antibodies 
The immunogenicity assays included homogeneous bridging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay validated 
for testing of anti-MYL-1402O/anti-Avastin antibodies in normal and disease-state serum and a non-cell-
based assay to determine Nab in NSCLC serum. A multi-tiered approach was employed as recommended in 
EMA guidelines. The single assay strategy was used for ADA and NAb assays. Samples from three clinical 
studies were analysed by the same assay format but the assays were modified due to VEGF interference 
observed in the Phase I Study MYL-1402O-1002 to achieve better performance for Phase III study samples. 
Full assay validation data were submitted, antibodies were reliably detected (see discussion).  
Study MYL-1402O-1002 - Pivotal Pharmacokinetics 
A single centre, randomised, double-blind, three-arm parallel phase I study to assess pharmacokinetics, 
safety and tolerability of MYL-1402O solution for intravenous infusion after 90 minute intravenous infusion at 
one dose level (equivalent weight-adjusted dose [1 mg/kg]) compared to the EU and US marketed drug 
product (Avastin) in healthy male volunteers was conducted in Europe. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 33/125 
 
 
 
After randomisation, subjects received one of the following treatments: a single 1 mg/kg dose administered 
by iv infusion (25 mL over approximately 90 minutes) of MYL-1402O, an equivalent iv infusion of US-Avastin 
(1 mg/kg), or an equivalent iv infusion of EU-Avastin (1 mg/kg). 
For the determination of the PK, a total of 28 blood samples were collected per subject from pre-dose to Day 
99. Blood sampling for PK of bevacizumab in serum was performed at pre-dose and the following times after 
the start of infusion: Day 1 (0.33, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 h), Day 2 (24 h), Day 3 (48 h), Day 4 (72 
h), Day 5 (96 h), Day 6 (120 h), Day 7 (144 h), Day 8 (168 h), Day 9 (192 h), Day 12 (264 h), Day 15 (336 
h), Day 22 (504 h), Day 29 (672 h), Day 43 (1008 h), Day 57 (1344 h), Day 71 (1680 h), Day 85 (2016 h), 
and Day 99 (2352 h). 
Pharmacokinetic results 
Summary of the PK data without subject 0213 (n=110) can be found in Table 4. 
Table 4. Summary of Bevacizumab Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Mean [CV%]) 
For all three pairwise comparisons, the bioequivalence criterion was based on the LS mean ratios of the 
primary PK parameter (AUC0-inf). Bioequivalence was to be concluded if the 90% geometric CIs of the ratios 
(MYL-1402O/US-Avastin, MYL-1402O/EU-Avastin, and EU-Avastin/US-Avastin) of LS means from the ANOVA 
of the natural log transformed AUC0-inf were within 80% to 125%. 
The statistical analyses of the PK parameters for bevacizumab based on 110 subjects (excluding the subject 
with anomalous bevacizumab concentrations) are summarised in Table 5. 
Table 5. Summary of LS Means Ratios and 90% Confidence Intervals 
The 90% CIs for the primary PK parameter, AUC0-inf, fell within the bioequivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25 for 
all three pairwise comparisons, MYL-1402O/US-Avastin, MYL-1402O/EU-Avastin, and EU-Avastin/US-Avastin, 
following a single, 1 mg/kg iv dose in healthy adult male volunteers. This study demonstrates that MYL-
1402O is bioequivalent to US-Avastin and EU-Avastin, and that EU-Avastin is bioequivalent to US-Avastin.

As the study participants of the study MYL-1402O-1002 were divided in the randomisation process to several 
groups, further analyses were provided accounting for a group effect in the ANOVA model for the biosimilarity 
assessment of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf. Two analyses were considered: 1) primary analysis with ANOVA 
model applied on data excluding subject 0213 and 2) secondary analysis with ANOVA model applied on data 
from all subjects. In both cases, bioequivalence was concluded as 90% confidence intervals for key 
pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf) were entirely within the bioequivalence range (80%, 
125%). 
Study MYL-1402O-3001  
This study was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel-group, equivalence study to evaluate 
patients with Stage IV nsNSCLC when treated in first-line with bevacizumab (either MYL-1402O [test product] 
or Avastin [reference product]) in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel (CP) and subsequently, with 
monotherapy of bevacizumab (either MYL-1402O or Avastin). A total of 671 patients were randomised with 
337 patients to the MYL-1402O arm and 334 patients to the Avastin arm. 
Bevacizumab (MYL-1402O or Avastin) was administered by iv infusion at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 21 days 
(± 3 days) for up to 6 treatment cycles (1 treatment cycle = 21 days).  
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected:  
-  at baseline (if possible within 1 hour prior to bevacizumab dosing) 
-  pre-dose (if possible, within 1 hour prior to first dose of bevacizumab) at Cycles 2 through 6 
-  post-dose (immediately after infusion, < 15 minutes) at Cycles 1, 2, 4, 6 
Two additional PK samples were to be collected from all patients in any cycle (1 to 6): 1 sample to be 
collected between Days 3 and 8 (inclusive) in any cycle, and 1 sample to be collected between Days 10 and 
18 (inclusive) in any cycle; and an additional sample collected at Safety Follow-Up Visit/EOT Visit, as 
applicable.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
-  Pharmacokinetic concentrations and covariate data have been analysed by PopPK methods for all patients 
with evaluable PK data. Empiric Bayesian estimates of PK model parameters have been obtained for all 
patients.  
-  Pharmacokinetic parameters and exposure estimates (area under the concentration-versus-time curve 
(AUC), maximum concentration, minimum concentration, clearance, volume, and terminal elimination 
half-life) have been compared between treatment arms.  
Pharmacokinetic results 
A two-compartment linear mammillary model with zero-order input was used as a starting point to evaluate 
bevacizumab PK in the pooled dataset. Data utilised in the creation of analysis datasets included dosing 
information (amount, route, timing), PK sampling information (time relative to dosing, bevacizumab serum 
concentration), treatment assignment, demographic data, laboratory values, and presence of ADA levels, 
where available. The datasets for use in the PopPK modeling included subject data from all treatment arms. 
Analysis datasets provided a time-ordered sequence of relevant events constructed for each subject from 
time of first dose until time of last sample. The exact times of sampling relative to dosing, as captured on the 
case report form, were used for PK analysis.

The model describing the PK of MYL-1402O versus Avastin was considered to be robust, and the structure 
and parameter estimates were similar to a previously published model. The low frequency of antidrug 
antibodies was similar between treatments. However, a model-based assessment of ADA as a covariate of 
clearance (CL) was inconclusive due to the low frequency of ADA development with each treatment, which 
was restricted to the time-varying binary variable ADA (positive/negative). Population pharmacokinetic 
profiles of MYL-1402O versus Avastin were not different in patients with nsNSCLC. Treatment was not a 
significant covariate of CL (P = 0.453) or volume of the central compartment (P = 0.161) using the likelihood 
ratio χ 2 test.  
Individual Exposure Measurements 
The individual exposure parameters AUC, half-life, Cmax, and Cmin were predicted based on the final model for 
all Phase III patients in steady state. The results were summarised by treatment group (Table 6).

The results demonstrated the similarity of treatments in familiar PK terms. While statistical analyses were not 
performed of these extrapolated exposure measures, these estimates of exposure were comparable between 
treatments. 
Study BM100-CC-03-I-01 
Forest plots were presented to explore the magnitude of impact of significant covariates in the final PK model 
on measures of drug exposure. The covariate data were divided into titres, then stratified by treatment, and 
the second titre exposures were used as reference for the higher and lower titres. The impact of all covariates 
on AUC, half-life, and Cmax was modest since geometric mean ratio (GMRs) and 90% CI ranges fell mostly 
within a range of 0.8 to 1.25 indicating the first and third tertile exposures were not substantially different 
from the second tertile (reference group). Additionally, these ranges were similar between the treatment 
groups. The greatest impact of some covariates on exposure appears to be on Cmin levels, since for some 
covariates the GMR and 90% CI ranges fell below 80% of the second tertile covariate range.  
Overall, however, the AUC, half-life, Cmax, and Cmin values were similar between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin 
in patients with nsNSCLC. In addition, since the ranges of exposures between upper and lower titre 
exposures for most covariates fell within the 0.8 to 1.25 range, there is no anticipated need for dose 
adjustment in the clinic, based on identified covariates.  
The study was a multicentre, double blind, randomised, parallel-group, phase III study to compare the PK, 
efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Bmab-100 and bevacizumab in combination with XELOX (oxaliplatin 
and capecitabine) chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The study consisted of two 
parts. Part 1 of the study was an open-label safety study which included 10 patients who had received prior 
chemotherapy for mCRC and received Bmab-100 at the dose of 7.5 mg/kg along with XELOX chemotherapy, 
for up to 6 cycles. Part 2 was a double-blind, randomised, active controlled, parallel-arm study in patients 
with mCRC, and included patients who had not received any chemotherapy for mCRC (i.e. only first line 
mCRC patients). Patients received Bmab-100/Avastin at 7.5 mg/kg and XELOX chemotherapy for up to 6 
cycles. Each cycle consisted of a 21-day period.  
Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed (only in Part 2 of the study) on the following days and time points. 
Day of first bevacizumab infusion (first Dose, Cycle 1): Pre dose (-5 min), and Post dose (after end of 
infusion) at 20 min, 1, 1.5, 3, 5 , 8, 24 hours (Day 2); and 72 (Day 4), 120 (Day 6), 192 (Day 9), and 360 
hours (Day 16) post dose. Cycles 2-6: Pre dose (-5 min). 
The primary PK parameters, i.e. Cmax and AUC0-t (AUC0-504), were similar for both Bmab-100 and Avastin. This 
was demonstrated by the point estimates of the ratio (%) of least square means of Bmab-100 to Avastin 
which were close to 1 (Cmax: 92.91% and AUC0-504: 95.79%). In addition, the 90% CIs were within the pre-
defined bioequivalence range of 80.00% to 125.00% (Cmax: 85.86% and 100.54%; AUC0-504: 87.56% and 
104.79%), confirming the single dose pharmacokinetic equivalence of the two products. The total patient 
variability for Cmax was 27.42%; AUC0-504 was 31.38%.  
The data from this study are considered supportive and confirm that there are no significant differences in PK 
parameters Cmax and AUC0-t (AUC0-504h) for Bmab-100 and Avastin. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No dedicated pharmacodynamics (PD) and/or pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD studies were performed in healthy 
subjects or in a patient population as part of this Marketing Authorisation Application.

PD parameters (i.e. plasma VEGF levels) were evaluated in the supportive study BM100-CC-03-I-01 with 
Bmab-100, an “earlier version” of MYL-1402O. In this study, the exploratory PD endpoint was to evaluate and 
compare the plasma VEGF levels between Bmab-100 and Avastin.  
Immunogenicity 
Study MYL-1402O-1002 
As part of immunogenicity assessment, samples were tested for presence of ADA. ADA samples were taken 
at baseline, Day 15 (336 h), Day 43 (1008 h), Day 71 (1680 h) and Day 99 (2352 h). ADA results were 
reported from all subjects at all the above stated time points (Table 7).  
Table 7. Incidence of anti-drug antibodies by visit and treatment 
Prior to dosing (baseline), 1 of the 37 (2.70%) subjects were positive for ADA in the MYL-1402O and EU-
Avastin groups and 2 of the 37 (5.41%) subjects were positive for ADA in the US-Avastin group. The highest 
pre-dose ADA titre obtained was 5.03 in the EU-Avastin arm, and 1 in the US-Avastin and MYL-1402O arms.  
Post dosing, none of the baseline positive subjects showed a significant increase in titre with time. The 
percentage of ADA positive subjects on Days 15, 43, 71 and 99 was comparable across treatments. 
The treatment-induced ADA positivity seen on Day 15 was transient. In all 3 arms, the percentage of 
treatment-induced ADA positive subjects declined with time and by day 99, >85% subjects became ADA 
negative. Table 8 summarises the ADA titres by visit and treatment. Overall, ADA titres were comparable 
across all 3 arms across all time points. The highest post-dose ADA titre obtained was 20.9, 16.3 and 14.7 
respectively in the MYL-1402O, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin arms.

Table 8. Summary of anti-drug antibody titres by visit and treatment 
Study MYL-1402O-3001 
A total of 12 (3.6%) and 16 patients (5.0%) were positive for ADA at baseline in the MYL-1402O and Avastin 
arms, respectively. The incidence of baseline ADA positivity in a small proportion of patients has been 
observed in other bevacizumab studies and may be due to potential cross-reactivity with pre-existing 
antibodies. Post-baseline, the number of ADA positive patients were low, declined over time and were 
comparable between both treatment arms (Table 9).

A total of 2 (0.6%) and 4 (1.2%) patients were positive for NAb at baseline in the MYL-1402O and Avastin 
arms, respectively. Post-baseline, the incidence of NAb positivity was very low, transient in nature, and the 
number of positive patients were comparable between both treatment arms (Table 10). 
Table 10. Summary of NAb samples analysed by visit and treatment – Safety set 
The overall ADA incidence was similar between the treatment arms (18 [5.9%] in the MYL-1402O arm vs 13 
[4.2%] in the Avastin arm). Additionally, no boosted ADA was reported (the titre ≥ 4*baseline titre while on 
treatment) for MYL-1402O group, but it was reported for 2 patients in Avastin arm (Table 11). 
Table 11. Overall incidence of treatment emergent ADA – Safety set 
The incidence of binding ADA was similar between the treatment arms (22 [7.1%] in the MYL-1402O arm vs 
21 [6.6%] in the Avastin arm, as shown in Table 12. The incidence of NAb was lower in MYL-1402O arm (1 
[0.3%]) compared to Avastin arm (8 [2.5%]).

Table 12. Overall summary of immunogenicity – Safety set 
Study BM100-CC-03-I-01 
At baseline, prior to dosing, 5 of the 68 (7.35%) and 2 of the 67 (2.99%) patients were positive for ADA in 
the Bmab-100 and the Avastin arm, respectively. The highest individual pre-dose ADA titre was 7.0 ng/mL in 
the Bmab-100 arm and 6.0 ng/mL in the Avastin arm. At visit 4 and EOS, the percentage of ADA-positive 
patients was comparable between the two treatments (Visit 4: 86.54% patients in Bmab-100 arm and 
87.27% patients in the Avastin arm; EOS: 90.20% patients in the Bmab-100 arm and 90.38% patients in the 
Avastin arm). 
The titres in ADA positive patients were low post-dose and did not change significantly over time. Titres were 
comparable in both arms. The highest individual post-dose ADA titres obtained in the Bmab-100 and Avastin 
arms were 9.0 ng/mL and 7.0 ng/mL respectively. The overall ADA rate was calculated using a conservative 
approach, which considers all patients who tested positive for ADA at least once, at any time point post-
baseline regardless of the ADA result at baseline. Overall, ADA rate was found to be comparable across 
treatments (80.88% [55/68] in the Bmab-100 arm and 88.06% [59/67] in the Avastin arm). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
A pivotal Phase I PK comparability, safety, immunogenicity study in healthy subjects (MYL-1402O-1002) 
following a 1 mg/kg IV infusion was conducted to demonstrate PK comparability of the developed 
bevacizumab product with the reference EU-product (as well as US-product) bevacizumab. The study was 
well designed with no significant issues identified. PK equivalence between the products was concluded 
following single 1 mg/kg IV infusion.  
Furthermore, available PK data of study MYL-1402O-3001, a pivotal confirmatory phase III efficacy and 
safety study in nsNSCLC patients, was submitted. The obtained data were analysed in population 
pharmacokinetics (PopPK) analysis. The pharmacokinetic profiles of MYL-1402O versus Avastin were not 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 41/125 
 
 
 
 
different in patients with nsNSCLC. Treatment was not a significant covariate of CL (P = 0.453) or volume of 
the central compartment (P = 0.161) using the likelihood ratio χ2-test. Model-based exposure measures were 
similar between treatments. 
The presented PopPK analysis and individual parameters did not provide sufficient information needed to 
conclude comparability between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin. Therefore, for the purpose of comparing the 
PKs, a statistical comparison of the Cmax and Ctrough at steady state (test versus reference) was performed 
(data not shown). Confidence intervals for both the parameters were within standard bioequivalence limits. 
The results confirmed equivalence between the test and the reference product also at steady state, therefore 
pharmacokinetic equivalence can be concluded. 
In addition, a supportive PK, comparative efficacy, safety and immunogenicity study in mCRC patients 
(BM100-CC-03-I-01) was conducted.  
Overall, the PK similarity was shown in the presented studies. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No dedicated PD or PK/PD studies were performed in healthy subjects or in a patient population. 
PD parameters (i.e. plasma VEGF levels) were evaluated in the supportive study BM100-CC-03-I-01 with an 
earlier version of MYL-1402O, Bmab-100. In this study, the exploratory PD endpoint was to evaluate and 
compare the plasma VEGF levels between Bmab-100 and Avastin. However, distinct variations were seen in 
the VEGF levels. 
Since no validated biomarker exists that is considered relevant to predicting clinical outcomes for 
bevacizumab in patients, this is considered not to be of clinical relevance. 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity profile of Abevmy was evaluated within three clinical studies and the respective 
recommendations on immunogenicity evaluation delineated in EMA guidelines “Guideline on immunogenicity 
assessment of monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo clinical use” (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010; 24-
May-2012) and “Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1)” were followed except for several points mentioned below.  
In the pharmacokinetic study MYL-1402O-1002, the antibody formation was investigated at baseline and four 
additional time points. Although, the baseline results indicated only few patients with positive ADA results, 
the majority of enrolled subjects have ADA-positive results on D15. The same data were obtained across all 
treatment groups suggesting the false positivity of obtained data. Although the ADA positivity was transient 
within the time and only several patients remained ADA-positive on D99. ADA assay sensitivity was high, 
which may have contributed to the detection of high ADA rates in study MYL- 1402O-1002. In addition, assay 
interference with VEGF (released from the drug during the acid dissociation step) was identified as the main 
reason for the high incidence of ADA-positive samples. NAb analysis was not planned to be included in the 
single dose PK comparability study MYL-1402O-1002 given the low risk of NAb development identified in 
multidose phase III clinical studies with the originator Avastin. The applicant further justified the absence of 
NAb analysis by the lack of clinical relevance of the low ADA levels detected in study MYL-1402O-1002.  
Assessment report

To understand the potential impact of ADA exposure on the PK endpoints subjects were allocated to two 
groups based on the calculated AUC of the ADA titre values for each subject (data not shown). The groups 
were made by splitting the total of 110 subjects with available ADA results into a “Low ADA” group, which 
included the 55 subjects with the lowest ADA AUC values, and a “High ADA” group, which included the 55 
subjects with the highest ADA AUC values. Subjects in the “High ADA” group had AUC values over 80.00 with 
individual titres values ranging from 1 to 20.97, while subjects in the “Low ADA” group had AUC values less 
than 80.00 with individual titre values ranging from 1 to 3.20. Although a more detailed analysis including 
quartiles of ADA values (AUC and titre) and its impact on PK parameters would have been more meaningful, 
the provided analysis did not hint at any differences in PK comparing subjects with high ADA values to 
subjects with rather low ADA values. However, results revealed that the “High ADA” group had higher 
bevacizumab exposure based on the AUC0-inf ratio of 1.11 relative to the “Low ADA” group. The higher 
exposure seen for the “High ADA” group compared to the “Low ADA” group could be a result of the ADA 
assay conditions employed for this study, since the split into the high and low groups was based on AUC of 
ADA titre values, which may not have truly reflected the presence or amount of anti-drug antibodies present 
in each sample. With regard to biosimilarity, the applicant provided plots comparing Cmax versus AUCada, 
AUCt versus AUCada, and AUCinf versus AUCada for MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin. PK parameters have not 
been plotted against ADA titre itself. However, AUCada was calculated from the ADA titre values for each 
subject across all time points. The analyses do not reveal significant differences of the impact of ADA status 
on PK parameters comparing MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin. 
The crucial immunogenicity data were obtained from the phase III study MYL-1402O-3001. In line with the 
two above mentioned guidelines, the appropriate multi-tiered approach was applied including conduction of 
three key assays (screening, confirmatory and NAb). The samples were collected at Baseline (pre-dose), 
Cycle 2, 4, and 6 in Period 1, and at Safety Follow-up visit, which is considered acceptable. At first time 
point, W4, 12 (4.0%) and 11 patients (3.5%) were ADA positive in the MYL-1402O and Avastin arms, 
respectively. On the last time point, EOT, there was only 1 patient with ADA-positive results in each 
treatment group showing a transient nature of developed ADAs. In total, in 18 and 11 patients the 
treatment-induced ADA were observed in the MYL-1402O and Avastin groups, respectively. Additionally, no 
boosted ADA was reported (the titre ≥ 4*baseline titre while on treatment) for MYL-1402O group, but it was 
reported for 2 patients in Avastin arm.  
Regarding the incidence of NAb positivity, only 2 and 4 patients, respectively, were tested as positive at 
baseline and only 1 patient in Avastin groups was tested Nab positive at EOT. Results from the first period 
including 6 cycles demonstrate the similar immunogenicity profile between both arms. After 42 weeks of 
treatment, the overall incidence of Treatment Emergent ADA (Treatment Induced plus Treatment Boosted) 
was similar between the treatment arms (20 [6.5%] in the MYL-1402O arm vs 15 [4.8%] in the Avastin arm) 
(data not shown). ADA incidence rate was generally low, as expected for bevacizumab. Post baseline, NAb 
occurred at a slightly lower rate in the MYL-1402O arm 2 [0.6%] compared to Avastin arm 8 [2.5%]). 
However, this difference is not considered significant. 
In the supportive study BM100-CC-03-I-01, the immunogenicity baseline data showed only few patients with 
positive ADA samples. At second timepoint (Visit 4), the incidence of ADA was around 85% in both 
investigated treatment arms. This is quite unusual for this substance, but the same conclusions were also 
seen in the Phase I MYL-1402O-1002 study as indicated above. The high number of ADA positive patients, in 
this study even persisting until EOS, was again explained by the detection of low-level ADA due to high assay 
sensitivity coupled with target (VEGF) interference. No other immunogenicity data within the treatment 
period were provided. According to the low relative ADA concentration calculated for all ADA positive 
samples, there was no clinical impact of the observed ADA levels. In accordance with the study MYL-1402O-
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 43/125 
 
 
 
1002, no determination of NAb was made, which was justified by the low risk of NAb development identified 
in multi-dose phase III clinical studies with the originator Avastin and the lack of clinical relevance of the low 
ADA levels detected in study BM100-CC-03-I-0. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK similarity was shown in the presented studies. 
Identified issues with regard to immunogenicity were adequately addressed. The incidence of ADA was 
generally comparable between MYL-1402O and the reference product within each trial, so that biosimilarity 
with regard to immunogenicity can be concluded, despite the presence of high ADA incidence rates clinical 
studies BM100-CC-03-I-01 and MYL-1402O-1002. 
With respect to proposed legal basis, submitted data on pharmacodynamics are considered acceptable.

Figure 1. Study design for MYL-1402O-3001 
Study Participants 
671 subjects with Stage IV unresectable, recurrent or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with negative or 
unknown activating EGFR gene mutations and negative or unknown ALK gene translocations were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by gender, smoking status (smoker or <100 cigarettes in entire life-
time) and number of metastasis sites (one site or multiple sites) to receive either MYL-1402O or EU-Avastin. 
A total of 89 sites randomised patients into the study. Study sites were located in Belarus, Bosnia, Bulgaria, 
Croatia, Georgia, Hungary, India, Italy, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine 
and Vietnam. 
The mean age was 59 years; 424 male and 247 female patients were included. 68.3% of patients were 
white. The most dominant cancer type was adenocarcinoma (95.5%).  
The presented baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms, and the inclusion/ exclusion 
criteria were in accordance with the Avastin study in advanced NSCLC patients.  
Treatments 
IMP: Patients were randomised to receive either MYL-1402O or EU-Avastin 15 mg/kg iv infusion every 21 
days for up to 6 treatment cycles. Supplied for use as a concentrate for solution (100 mg or 400 mg per vial). 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 46/125 
 
 
 
 
Non-IMP: Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 iv infusion over 3 hours / Carboplatin AUC 6 iv infusion over 30 minutes on 
Day 1 of each cycle during the induction treatment period. Each cycle started with administration of 
bevacizumab followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
In countries where the initial paclitaxel dose was 175 mg/m2 based on institutional protocols, PIs were 
allowed to initiate dosing at 175 mg/m2. 
Study phases and conduct 
Screening/Baseline Period was up to 4 weeks. 
Period 1: Patients received bevacizumab combination therapy (MYL-1402O or Avastin, plus CP) on Day 0 of 
Cycle 1 for up to 6 cycles (21 days ± 3 days) of therapy. Tumour assessments (CT scan or MRI) were 
performed every 6 weeks. 
Period 2: A patient was eligible to continue into Period 2 if he/she had a response of SD or better (i.e., CR or 
PR) as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria at the end of Period 1. Eligible patients continued to receive either 
MYL-1402O or Avastin every 3 weeks as monotherapy. Tumour assessments were performed every 12 weeks 
at pre-specified time points, regardless of the delays of the cycles of treatment until progression of disease 
(PD) or discontinuation of interventional therapy (for any reason), or withdrawal of consent. 
If a patient was discontinued from treatment prior to completion of Period 2 due to an adverse event, the 
patient’s tumour assessment was performed per the schedule until Week 42. Patients who had started on a 
new anticancer treatment (surgery, radiotherapy or systemic treatment) or who had PD were followed for OS 
until Week 42. 
Extended Treatment Period: Patients who had maintained SD or better (CR or PR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria at 
Week 42 entered into the extended treatment period and continued to receive bevacizumab monotherapy 
(either MYL-1402O or Avastin) until PD, discontinuation of treatment, or termination of study. 
The End of Treatment (EOT) Visit was performed after the last dose of any interventional therapy, primarily 
to record the reason for discontinuation of the first-line treatment. 
Safety Follow-Up Visit was held 28 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of bevacizumab.  
The treatment scheme and the administered doses of bevacizumab are according to the SmPC for Avastin as 
indicated for non-squamous NSCLC patients and in line with current guidelines.  
This applies also to the ChT regimen with 200 mg/m2 paclitaxel and carboplatin AUC 6.0, which is in line with 
current guidelines and commonly used by clinicians in the EU. However, in countries where the initial dose for 
paclitaxel was 175 mg/m2 based on institutional protocols, the investigators were allowed to initiate dosing at 
175 mg/m2 instead of 200 mg/m2. The majority of patients (69.9%) received the higher initial dose of 200 
mg/m2. In addition, the number of patients with the different paclitaxel doses was balanced between the 
treatment arms. 
Disease status was evaluated by CT scans or MRI every 6 weeks during Period 1 (first 18 weeks of 
combination treatment) and thereafter every 12 weeks during Period 2 (24 weeks of monotherapy 
treatment). In individual cases, treatment was delayed, discontinued, switched to bevacizumab monotherapy 
(due to intolerance of CP) or switched to CP (due to intolerance of bevacizumab). Thus, the number of 
treatment cycles varies between individual patients. As the number of cycles varies between 1 and 6 and due 
to possible study discontinuation before the end of the induction period, the number of response assessments 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 47/125 
 
 
 
can range from 0-3 during Period 1. The duration of exposure to study drug and the overall number of doses/ 
cycles were presented by treatment group with descriptive statistics using the Safety set. In addition, the 
number of patients with a certain number of cycles have been presented per treatment arm, for both the ITT 
and the PP set. There is a numerical imbalance with regard to the number of treatment cycles received, both 
in the ITT and PP set – there was a higher number of subjects who were treated for only 1 cycle in the MYL-
1402O arm than in the Avastin-arm, whereas patients who were treated for 4 cycles had a higher frequency 
for Avastin than for MYL-1402O. However, this levels off for cycle 6 – the majority of patients and, 
importantly, similar numbers of subjects per treatment arm received a total number of 6 treatment cycles 
(PP set: 65.0% in the MYL-1402O arm vs 65.6% in the Avastin arm). Thus, overall, the two treatment arms 
are considered comparable. 
Overall the duration of exposure, the number of doses administered and the cumulative doses of 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin were comparable between treatment arms in the induction period. 
With regard to the duration of IMP exposure, the total number of cycles received was similar between both 
treatment arms during the induction period (1627 vs 1626 cycles). For the maintenance period, a numerically 
higher number of treatment cycles was administered in the MYL-1402O arm (1278 vs 1242 cycles). This 
could be attributed mainly to a higher number of patients having received 7 cycles in the MYL-1402O arm 
than in the Avastin arm (n=20 vs n=9). 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the data from independent central review. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the ORR of MYL-102O with that of EU-Avastin, in 
combination with chemotherapy, during the first 18 weeks of first-line treatment in subjects diagnosed with 
Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the ORR based on best tumour response as assessed by an independent 
review at any time point during the first 18 weeks, according to RECIST1.1. The ORR was defined as the 
proportion of patients with CR or PR as the best overall response (BOR) during the first 18 weeks; the 
number of patients in the ITT set was used as the denominator for the calculation. 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on difference in ORRs in the ITT population, and equivalence 
between the two treatment groups was declared if the 95% CI of the difference in the best ORR was entirely 
contained within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [-12.5%, 12.5%]. The analysis was repeated in the 
PP set to support the primary analysis. 
Subjects underwent radiographic assessment of disease status (CT or MRI) according RECIST v1.1 in cycles 
2, 4, and 6, and then every 4 cycles until there was radiographic documentation of progressive disease (PD), 
unacceptable toxicity, death, or end of study (EOS), whichever occurred first. Patients with response who 
could not be evaluated per RECIST1.1 or without any tumour assessment prior to or on Week 18 were scored 
as non-responders.  
Tumour response was assessed using RECIST1.1 criteria locally by investigators and centrally by independent 
reviewers. The primary efficacy analysis is based on the data from the independent central review. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for the study were: 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 48/125 
 
 
 
• DCR (CR, PR, or stable disease) during the first 18 weeks 
• PFS, defined as the time from randomisation to the first documentation of PD or to death due to any cause, 
whichever comes first; PFS rate at 18 weeks and 42 weeks, median PFS at 42 weeks. 
• OS, defined as the time from randomisation to date of death due to any cause, OS rates at 18 weeks and 
42 weeks. 
• DOR, defined as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumour response (CR or PR) to 
the first documentation of tumour progression (i.e., PD) or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first. 
The pharmacokinetics endpoints were as follows: 
• PopPK measures of exposure of MYL-1402O and the reference product Avastin (e.g., Area Under the 
Concentrate Curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax), minimum concentration (Cmin), clearance (CL), 
volume (Vc), and terminal elimination half-life. 
The safety endpoints were as follows: 
• Incidence, nature, and severity of AEs including adverse drug reactions graded according to NCI CTCAE. 
• Detection of antibodies to bevacizumab. 
The immunogenicity variable, the formation of ADA against MYL-1402O or Avastin, was assessed to examine 
and compare the clinical immunogenic response to the study drugs. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 628 patients (314 per treatment group) provided 80% power for testing equivalence of MYL-
1402O and Avastin at 1-sided 2.5 % level of significance, for the primary endpoint ORR at week 18. This sample 
size assumed that the ORR was 38.0% for both MYL-1402O and Avastin. Statistical equivalence was declared 
if the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference of the 2 treatment groups fell wholly within an equivalence margin of (-
12.5%, 12.5%). 
Given that a single post-baseline assessment was needed for a patient’s inclusion in the ITT population, an 
attrition rate of 2% was assumed for the study, which led to the number of 640 patients (320 per treatment 
group) to be randomised. The final sample size was determined at the interim analysis using the sample size 
re-estimation approach described in the SAP. 
For the ITT set, the IA provided an objective response rate (ORR) of 25.2%. Based on the pre-specified 
algorithm in the protocol and SAP, the sample size was re-estimated for the risk difference and increased up 
to a maximum of 670 patients to maintain the power for testing primary endpoint per EMA requirement. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomised 1:1 stratified by gender, smoking status, and number of metastasis sites. The 
randomisation schedule was administered by an interactive voice or web response system (IVRS/IWRS). 
This was a double-blind study. Principle investigator and study site personnel, the study patients and the 
local and central radiologists were planned to be blinded throughout the study. An unblinded pharmacist was 
planned to allocate treatment via the IVRS/IWRS by preparing infusion bags of MYL-1402O and Avastin to 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 49/125 
 
 
 
the PI in a blinded manner. Parts of the sponsor clinical team was planned to be unblinded to the 
randomisation list after all patients have completed Week 18 or discontinued the study. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis sets were defined: 
- 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Set: The ITT set was planned to consist of all randomised patients. Analyses 
using the ITT set group patients according to randomised treatment.  
- 
Safety Set (SS): The safety set was planned to consist of all randomised patients who received at 
least one dose or partial dose of MYL-1402O or Avastin. Analyses using SS group patients according to 
treatment actually received.  
- 
Per Protocol (PP) set: The PP set was planned to consist of all randomised patients who received at 
least one dose of MYL-1402O or Avastin and do not have major protocol deviations. Analyses using PP group 
patient according to randomised treatment. 
- 
Population PK (PopPK) Set: The PopPK set was planned to consist of all randomised patients who 
completed at least 1 dose of allocated study medication and who provide at least 1 evaluable post-dose drug 
concentration for PopPK analyses. Analyses using PopPK set group patients according to treatment actually 
received. 
In general data were summarised by statistical characteristics (categorical data: absolute and relative 
frequencies; continuous data: mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). 
Efficacy analyses 
The ITT set was used for the efficacy analyses. 
Primary efficacy endpoint was planned to be the difference in ORR at Week 18, according to RECIST 1.1. It 
was planned to be analysed using an unstratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test together with an 
asymptotic 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in ORRs at Week 18. Equivalence was to be concluded in case 
the 95% CI for the difference in ORRs at Week 18 fell completely into the pre-defined equivalence range of -
12.5% to 12.5%. 
Missing values due to difficulties in assessing the ORR by RECIST 1.1 were scored as non-responders. 
However, for the primary EP of ORR, no missing values by reason of no assessment by RECIST1.1 occurred, 
and therefore, no sensitivity analysis due to this reason of missingness was performed. A justification how 
missing values by other reasons were handled was provided. 
For the PP population, patients were treated as non-responders with missing values due to disease 
progression, death, or AE. Patients with missing values for reasons other than that were excluded from the 
PP population. This procedure is considered comprehensible and suitable for the given study design. 
In order to assess the homogeneity of study results in important subgroups, the following variables were 
used to define subgroups: Age (<65 years of age median or ≥65 years of age median), Gender (Male or 
Female), Race (Caucasian or non-Caucasian; Asian or non-Asian), Smoking status (smoker or <100 
cigarettes in entire lifetime), Number of metastasis sites (1 or multiple), Prior weight loss (≥5% from the 
historical weight during the last 3 months or <5%), Prior radiation therapy (0 or ≥1), Prior adjuvant 
Assessment report

Page 50/125 
 
 
 
chemotherapy (0 or 1), ECOG performance scale at screening (0 or 1), EGFR mutation status (unknown or 
negative), EML4-ALK alterations (unknown or negative). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS). DCR was planned to be analysed as treatment difference and treatment ratio. The difference in 
DCRs between treatment groups were planned to be estimated with unstratified CMH test and an asymptotic 
2-sided 95% CI. 
Survival endpoints (PFS, OS) were planned to be analysed by Kaplan-Meier plots, median PFS and OS, and 
log-rank test for descriptive purposes. In addition, a Cox regression model was planned to be used for 
estimating hazard ratios with 95% CI for the treatment effect. The main model was planned to be performed 
without covariates. Sensitivity analysis was planned by adding covariates to the model.  
No formal hypothesis testing was planned for the secondary efficacy endpoints, therefore, no adjustments for 
multiplicity were planned. 
Safety analysis 
The safety set was planned to be used for the safety analyses. Safety analyses were mainly based on the 
frequency of AEs summarised by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group. Changes from 
baseline on performance status (ECOG) and clinical laboratory parameters were summarised similarly for 
each visit and treatment group. 
PK analyses 
A 2-compartment linear model was planned to be performed with CL, inter-compartmental clearance, Vc, and 
volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp). Inter-individual variability in CL and Vc was planned to be 
assigned with log-normal distribution.  
The provided clinical study report contains the results of the primary efficacy analysis and all other efficacy 
and safety results up to Week 18. A final study report is announced to be written after all patients have 
completed Week 42 or discontinued.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 2. Patient disposition – ITT set (42 weeks) 
A total of 1016 patients were screened; 345 patients were screening failures. The most common reasons for 
screening failures were; 57 (16.5%) patients met exclusion criteria 10b (thoracic, central, mediastinal 
tumour location in contact with major vessels); 46 (13.3%) patients withdrew consent during screening 
period (inclusion criteria 1); 37 (10.7%) patients did not meet inclusion criteria 10 (brain metastasis which 
was treated and stable at the time of signing ICF) and 36 (10.4%) patients did not meet inclusion criteria 5 
(at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1). 
A total of 671 patients were randomised with 337 patients to the MYL-1402O arm and 334 patients to the 
Avastin arm. All randomised patients were included in the ITT population. Comparable numbers of patients 
from both treatment arms completed the combination therapy period (MYL-1402O: n=227, Avastin: n=220). 
Of those who had completed the induction period, similar numbers discontinued treatment prior to entering 
the maintenance period (n=27 vs n=21). Furthermore, a similar number of patients discontinued (n=93 vs 
n=97) as well as completed treatment in Period 2 (n=107 vs n=102).

Table 14. Disposition of patients – Period 1 and Period 2 
Patient flow was comparable between treatment arms, except for imbalances in the proportion of patients 
who discontinued treatment due to an AE as well as in the number of deaths. This imbalance occurred

predominantly during the first 30 days of the study (MYL-1402O n= 13 deaths, EU-Avastin n=3 deaths) and 
was, among others, attributed to the higher incidence of AEs in the MYL-1402O arm. Nevertheless, overall 
the number of deaths is higher in the MYL-1402O than in the EU-Avastin arm. For more detailed assessment 
please refer to the respective safety sections below. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of patients was 59 years in both treatment arms, and majority (63.2%) of patients were 
males; and 53.5% were smokers. In both groups, the majority of patients were White (MYL-1402O 67.1% 
and Avastin 69.5%) and about 30% of patients were Asian (32.9 vs 30.5%). About 62% of the patients had 
multiple metastasis sites. 
The mean body weight (± SD) was slightly lower in the MYL-1402O arm (66.14 ± 16.7 kg) than in the 
Avastin arm (70.4 0 ± 18.67 kg). However, the mean BSA (± SD) was similar between the treatment arms 
(1.737 ± 0.2432 in the MYL-1402O arm and 1.794 ± 0.2701 in the Avastin arm). The dosing was based on 
body weight for bevacizumab and BSA for chemotherapy. 
In general, the demographic profile was balanced between treatment groups with respect to age, race, 
height, and ECOG status. Gender, smoking status, and number of metastasis sites were used for 
stratification, leading to balance between the treatment arms (Table 15).

Table 15. Demographic characteristics by treatment group – ITT set 
In general, both treatment arms were similar in terms of medical history. The majority of patients had at 
least 1 medical condition in their history (MYL-1402O, 86.1%, Avastin, 87.1%). The most commonly reported 
medical history disorders (>25% of total) were in the SOC of Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders 
(MYL-1402O, 141 [41.8%] and Avastin 142 [42.5%]); Vascular disorders (MYL-1402O, 133 [39.5%] and 
Avastin 112 [33.5%]); and Gastrointestinal disorders (MYL-1402O, 96 [28.5%] and Avastin 100 [29.9%]).  
Baseline disease characteristics were comparable between the two treatment arms. However, there were 
slightly higher proportion of patients with M1C substage in MYL-1402O arm, 125 (37.1%) patients compared

to 117 (35.0%) patients in Avastin arm. Table 16 provides the stage wise distribution of patients between the 
two treatment arms at the time of initial diagnosis. 
However, all the patients were in Stage IV at the time of randomisation into the study, as per the protocol 
requirement. 
Table 16. Tumour history and baseline characteristics by treatment group: ITT set 
The number of patients with prior anti-cancer surgery was 86 (25.5%) in MYL-1402O arm compared to 100 
(29.9%) in the EU-Avastin arm; prior anti-cancer radiotherapy was n=44 (13.1%) in MYL-1402O arm 
compared to n=33 (9.9%) in the EU-Avastin arm. 
The randomised study population was considered appropriate to represent the intended indication. Baseline 
characteristics were mostly balanced between treatment arms. There were slightly higher numbers of 
patients with M1C substage in the MYL-1402O arm (n=125 (37.1%)) compared to the EU-Avastin arm (n= 
117 (35.0%)). However, all patients had Stage IV disease state at the time of randomisation into the study.

The ITT set consisted of a total of 671 patients (337 in the MYL-1402O arm and 334 in the Avastin arm) who 
were randomised into the study under Protocol. The primary efficacy and other analyses were conducted 
using the ITT population. 
The Safety set consisted of 664 patients (335 in the MYL-1402O arm and 329 in the Avastin arm), who 
completed at least one dose or partial dose of MYL-1402O or Avastin. A total of 7 (1.0%) patients, 2 (0.6%) 
patients in MYL-1402O arm and 5 (1.5%) patients in the Avastin arm were excluded from safety analyses as 
they were baseline failures. 
The PP set consisted of 634 patients (320 in the MYL-1402O arm and 314 in the Avastin arm). The PP set 
consisted of all randomised patients who completed at least one dose of MYL-1402O or Avastin and did not 
have protocol deviations with significant impact on the study endpoints. Pre-defined rules described in SAP 
were applied to exclude patients from the PP population. Exclusion of patients from the PP set due to major 
protocol deviations were decided in a BDR meeting on August 16, 2019 before database lock (CSR Tables 
14.1.1.2, 14.1.3, and Listing 16.2.3). 
A total of 37 (5.5%) patients (17 [5.0%] patients in the MYL-1402O arm and 20 [6.0%] in the Avastin arm) 
were excluded from the PP set due to reasons summarised below (Table 18): 
Table 18. Patients exclusion from analysis sets 
The number of patients with protocol deviations by 10 categories as defined in SAP, Version 2 were provided. 
All patients with protocol deviations by criteria 1-5 were excluded from the PP set, deviations of criteria 6-10 
were decided on a case-by-case basis. Only patients with deviations categorised as major were excluded 
from the PP set.

Two patients were missed to have major deviations and consequently missed to be excluded from the PP 
analysis. A sensitivity analysis was provided by excluding these two patients with no controversial results. 
Table 21. Current and sensitivity PP set analyses for primary endpoint 
Overall, study drug was administered to 664 patients during the study (335 in the MYL-1402O arm and 329 
in the Avastin arm) who completed at least one dose or partial dose of MYL-1402O or Avastin. 
The duration of exposure as well as the number of doses administered and the cumulative doses for 
bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel are comparable between the treatment arms.  
With regard to the duration of IMP exposure, the total number of cycles received was similar between both 
treatment arms during the induction period (1627 vs 1626 cycles). For the maintenance period, a numerically 
higher number of treatment cycles was administered in the MYL-1402O arm (1278 vs 1242 cycles). This 
could be attributed mainly to a higher number of patients having received 7 cycles in the MYL-1402O arm 
than in the Avastin arm (n=20 vs n=9). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary EP was met: the best ORR during the first 18 weeks was 41.5% in the MYL-1402O arm and 
43.1% in the EU-Avastin arm (independent review, ITT population). The difference in ORR between both 
treatment groups was -1.6 (95% CI -9.0, 5.9), which fully met the pre-specified ± 12.5% equivalence 
margin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 59/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 22. Difference in ORR based on independent review: ITT set 
This was supported by sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint, e.g. best ORR during 18 weeks 
assessed by independent review in the PP population (ORR difference of -2.4, with a 95% CI of -10.2, 
5.3), as well as investigator-assessed in the ITT population (ORR difference of -2.2, with a 95% CI of -9.7, 
5.3). Here, results were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Table 23. Sensitivity analysis – Difference in ORR based on independent review: PP set 
Table 24. Sensitivity analysis – difference in ORR, derived BOR from investigator data – ITT set 
However, the independent review of the best ORR confirmed at a second time point in the ITT population 
revealed markably lower ORR rates for both treatment arms (29.1% in the MYL-1402O arm and 30.5% in the 
EU-Avastin arm). The applicant clarified that the independent review process took place one the patient had 
completed imaging for the respective review period (here: from Screening through Wk 18 DCO) and no 
further imaging time points were scheduled. In contrast, the investigator assessed the tumour response upon 
completion of each imaging time point (i.e. Wk 6, 12, 18), thus on a real-time basis. Within this context, 
treatment continuation was dependent on the overall tumour response (imaging plus patient´s clinical 
condition) at a specific time point. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 60/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is acknowledged that this observed difference in the response rates between independent review and 
investigator assessment is a general limitation that is known and described in literature. Subjective factors 
such as target-lesion selection as well as different interpretations of non-target or immeasurable lesions are 
discussed to be of relevance within this context. 
With regard to the overall lower confirmed response rate as per independent review (29.8%) compared to 
investigator assessment (40.4%), the applicant points out that this might be also attributed to limitations of 
the study design (i.e. the data cut-off defined for the review period for the primary EP). For late responders 
(i.e. patients with first CR or PR at Week 18), BOR could not be confirmed at a second time point; thus they 
were assessed as non-responders for this sensitivity analysis. Within this context, the applicant presents an 
additional analysis for BOR confirmed at a second time point based on independent review, conducted at 
Week 42. This confirmed response analysis based on Week 42 data provides a higher confirmed mean BOR of 
35.0%. 
However, this limitation of the DCO time point at Wk 18 for the primary EP in case of late responders and 
confirmed response analysis would also apply to the investigator-based assessment of confirmed response. 
Overall, since equivalence was shown between treatment arms in both independent review and investigator 
assessment for BOR as well as for confirmed response, the Rapporteurs consider that there is no critical issue 
with regard to proof of biosimilarity.

Secondary endpoints 
The analysis of DCR revealed no notable differences between the arms (independent review, ITT population). 
The proportion of patients with disease control at Week 18 in the 2 groups (MYL-1402O: 81.3% versus 
Avastin 86.2%) was comparable with a DCR difference of -4.9 (95% CI: -10.5, 0.6). This was confirmed by 
sensitivity analyses, i.e. independent review in the PP population and investigator-based assessment in the 
ITT population.

updated PFS analyses with the Week 42 CSR has been provided. The total number of events on independent 
review for progression-free survival (PFS) was 184 (54.6%) events in test arm and 156 (46.1%) events in 
Avastin arm at week 42. Estimated PFS (with corresponding 95% CI) was 7.6 (7.0, 9.5) months in the test 
arm and 9.0 (7.2, 9.7) months in the Avastin arm. The difference between treatment arms was not 
statistically significant on 5% significance level based on log-rank test (p-value=0.0906).  
When PFS was assessed by the investigator, median PFS was 7.8 (95% CI: 7.0, 9.5) months in the MYL-
1402O arm and 7.3 (95% CI: 7.0, 8.9) months in the Avastin arm, with a total number of 190 events 
(56.4%) in the MYL-1402O arm and 200 events (59.9%) in the Avastin arm. 
In a next step, a sensitivity analysis evaluating PFS with new anticancer therapy considered as an event (not 
reported as PD/ death in the primary analysis) has been conducted. Based on independent review, new 
anticancer therapy as an event occurred in 34 [10.2%] patients in the Avastin arm compared to 17 [5.0%] 
patients in the MYL-1402O arm.  
Complete DOR results with the Week 42 CSR have been submitted. Median DOR was comparable between 
the MYL-1402O and the Avastin arm (7.7 vs 6.9 months), which thus supports biosimilarity demonstrated in 
the primary analysis. 
Week 42 Time to First Objective Response data have been provided. With the full data set, the difference 
observed between the treatment arms for the Week 0-7 Time to First Objective Response diminishes from 
3.5% (Week 18 CSR) to 2.0%.  
Updated OS data have been provided with the final Week 42 CSR. In the MYL-1402O arm, 236 (70.0%) 
patients survived through Week 42 compared to 252 (75.4%) patients in the Avastin arm. This difference 
between the survival curves for both treatment groups was not statistically significant (p=0.1185). The OS 
HR at Week 42 was 1.26 (0.94, 1.69). In addition, the median OS was not reached in the ITT population at 
Week 42.

Assessment report

Page 62/125 
 
 
 
 
In addition, additional OS data including data beyond Week 42, which are not part of the Week 42 CSR have 
been submitted. Those data mainly originate from 274 out of 561 randomised study participants who 
originally consented to protocol version 1.0 (see also Question 113), implying that OS data were collected as 
long as patients continued in the study. In addition, data collected beyond Week 42 (until study closure) from 
25 out of 110 randomised patients who originally consented to protocol version 2.0 and had a study duration 
of more than 42 weeks were include for this extended OS analysis. However, the OS analysis including data 
beyond Week 42 did not show a clearly different picture: median OS was 71.9 weeks (95% CI: 56.71, 90.14) 
in the MYL-1402O arm compared to 77.3 weeks (95% CI: 67.71, 90.43) in the Avastin arm. The updated OS 
HR based on all data collected until study closure was 1.21 (0.94, 1.55). 
Figure 4. Overall survival KM plot including data beyond 42 weeks 
In general, a higher number of patients with disease progression was observed in the Avastin arm than in the 
MYL-1402O arm in the Week 18 data set (n=56 vs n=50), in the Week 42 data set (n=159 vs n=133), and 
until study closure (n=192 vs n=165). For those patients with disease progression, subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy was more frequently reported in the Avastin arm than in the MYL-1402O arm (Wk 18: n=24 vs n=8, 
Wk 42: n=45 vs n=28, until study closure: n=46 vs n=31), both in absolute and relative numbers. According 
to the applicant, this higher number of patients in the Avastin arm having received subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy might have contributed to higher survival rates compared to the MYL-1402O arm.  
With regard to the potential impact of deaths within 30 days of the first IMP dose, additional OS analyses 
excluding the deaths and discontinuations within 30 days of IMP have been conducted. In this subset of 
patients, the HR (95% CI) improved to 1.15 (0.85, 1.55) in the Week 42 data set and to 1.13 (0.87, 1.45) 
for data until study closure. To note, the median OS was not reached up to Week 42.

Ancillary analyses 
Primary endpoint 
Figure 7. Difference in ORR, Forest plot, Independent review, subgroup analysis: ITT set 
Subgroup analyses have been conducted for the ITT population and revealed no relevant differences for the 
primary endpoint, except for the subgroup receiving prior radiation therapy. Here the observed difference in 
best ORR between both treatment arms was -26.25% (95% CI -47.83, -5.20) with a best ORR of 25.0% in 
the MYL-1402O arm and of 51.2% in the EU-Avastin arm.  
Additional subgroup analyses using Forest Plots have been provided for the PP set. No distinct imbalances 
between treatment arms have been detected for any of the subgroups analysed, except for the subgroup 
having received prior radiation therapy, consistent with the ITT population. 
With regard to subgroup analysis by age, the ORR differences within the age groups <65, ≥65, <75 and ≥75 
were comparable between the treatment arms.  
Subgroup analysis by geographic region (Europe, India, Southeast Asia) has been performed and revealed no 
differences or imbalances for the primary endpoint. Additional analyses were presented with regard to EU 
versus non-EU countries and showed a slightly higher ORR for MYL-1402O compared to Avastin for the region 
EU-Europe. However, due to the small sample size of this subgroup (n=26 in the MYL-1402O arm vs n=29 in 
the Avastin arm), this seems to be a chance finding and is not considered to be of relevance. 
Secondary endpoints 
Subgroup analyses for DCR are presented as Forest Plot and reveal no relevant differences between the

Equivalence has been shown for the primary EP in the ITT assessed by 
independent review; the two-sided 95% CI was entirely within the pre-defined 
equivalence margin of ±12.5%. This was supported by sensitivity analyses for 
the primary EP, i.e. independent review in the PP population (see Table) as well 
as investigator-assessed in the ITT population (ORR difference of -2.2, 95% CI 
of -9.7, 5.3).  
In addition, the results for ORR at Week 18 support equivalence.

Phase III mCRC Study (BM100-CC-03-I-01) 
Supportive efficacy data from study BM100-CC-03-I-01, a comparative PK, efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity study of Bmab-100 and Avastin, both in combination with oxaliplatin-capecitabine (XELOX) 
chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, have been submitted. Primary objective was to 
demonstrate PK bioequivalence of Bmab-100 and EU-Avastin. The study was conducted in India. 
The study was conducted by Biocon, Ltd (Bangalore, India). Bmab-100 is an “earlier version” of as MYL-
1402O.  
it has been clarified that EU-Avastin was used as reference medicinal product in study BM100-CC-03-I-01. It 
was confirmed that one EU-Avastin batch was used in this study. The batch certificate for the same batch has 
also been submitted. 
Study design/ Objectives 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021

The study had two parts (1 and 2). The objective of Part 1 of the study was to generate the safety data of 
infusion-related reactions of the first dose of Bmab-100 when given with XELOX chemotherapy in 10 patients. 
The efficacy objectives of Part 2 of the study were to evaluate and compare ORR, DCR and PFS rate at 
18 weeks. 
Figure 13. Study design for BM100-CC-03-I-01 
Part 2 of the study was a double-blind, randomised, active controlled, parallel arm study in patients with 
mCRC. Part 2 of the study included patients who had not received any treatment for mCRC (i.e. only first line 
mCRC patients). Patients received Bmab-100 or EU-Avastin at 7.5 mg/kg along with XELOX chemotherapy for 
up to 6 cycles. Each cycle consisted of a 21-day period. As a whole, the study consisted of 21 days screening 
period, 15 weeks treatment period, followed by a 3 week follow up. The End of the Study evaluation was 
performed at the end of 18 weeks. Wherever possible, radiological assessments were performed 4-6 weeks 
after the EOS (Post EOS) in patients with first documentation of response (PR or CR at EOS). 
Study population 
For Part 2 of the study, first line mCRC patients were included. For details with regard to Inclusion/ Exclusion 
criteria, please refer to the D80 Clinical AR. 
Efficacy endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 71/125 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy was the secondary objective of the study. The efficacy objective was to evaluate and compare the 
effect of Bmab-100 and Avastin, in combination with XELOX chemotherapy on: 
- Overall response rate based on RECIST 1.1 criteria 
- PFS rate at 18 weeks. 
- DCR rate at 18 weeks 
The efficacy analyses were performed on the basis of tumour response evaluation by independent, blinded 
and centralised radiological evaluation according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines for radiological assessment of 
tumours. 
Study treatments 
Bevacizumab (Bmab-100 or Avastin) was administered by the investigator/designee at the dose of 7.5 mg/kg 
by IV infusion over 90 min (in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection) on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle 
along with XELOX chemotherapy for all patients. Up to 6 cycles of bevacizumab in combination with XELOX 
chemotherapy were administered. 
Bmab-100/Avastin was administered as IV infusions using appropriate aseptic technique. All infusions of 
bevacizumab were to be over 90 min. 
Oxaliplatin was administered at a dose 130 mg/m2 as an IV infusion in 500 mL of 5% dextrose over 2h on 
Day 1 of each cycle after the completion of Bmab-100/Avastin infusion. 
Oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 was administered twice daily on Day 1 through Day 15 (28 doses) of a 21-day 
cycle. The first dose of capecitabine was started in the evening of Day 1 and the last dose on the morning of 
Day 15, for each cycle. Patients were instructed to take capecitabine tablets within 30 min after the end of 
meal with a glass of water (breakfast and dinner). 
Disposition of subjects 
Part 2: A total of 237 patients were screened, of whom 101 (42.61%) failed screening (most common 
reasons for screen failure being lack of measurable disease and low hemoglobin/platelet count). 
136 patients were randomised (1:1) to either the Bmab-100 or the Avastin arm, of which 135 patients 
received treatment; one patient in the Avastin arm was randomised but then withdrew consent and was not 
dosed. Of the randomised patients, 86 (63.24%) patients completed the study and the rest were prematurely 
discontinued. Overall, the most common reasons for discontinuation were progression of disease, AEs and 
withdrawal of consent.

Demographics 
The demographic profile was similar in the Bmab-100 and Avastin arms with respect to age, height, weight, 
BSA and survival expectancy. The study included 84 male and 52 female patients of Asian origin; the mean 
age of patients in the Bmab-100 arm was 50.7±14.0 years and that in the Avastin arm was 51.6±12.8 years. 
The mean BSA of patients in the Bmab-100 arm was 1.58±0.17 m2 and in the Avastin arm was 1.60±0.17 
m2. The mean weight of the patients in the Bmab-100 arm was 56.20±11.64 kg and in the Avastin arm was 
57.31±11.31 kg. The mean height of patients in the Bmab-100 arm was 160.64±9.67 cm and in the Avastin

arm was 161.95±9.20 cm. The mean survival expectancy of patients in the Bmab-100 arm was 9.13 months 
and in the Avastin arm was 8.57 months (survival expectancy in both arms ranged between 4-24 months). 
Tumour history and Baseline characteristics 
All parameters evaluated were comparable for both the arms, except the disease burden in terms of sum of 
diameters of the target lesions, which was numerically higher in the Bmab-100 arm. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy of Bmab-100 and Avastin (both in combination with XELOX chemotherapy) was compared in terms of 
best overall response rate (BORR) over 18 weeks. BORR was determined in the PP as well as the ITT 
populations. Objective response was defined as a CR or PR. 
The ORR observed in the ITT population was 38.24% in the Bmab-100 arm and 48.53% in the Avastin arm. 
No statistically significant difference was observed between the two arms (p = 0.2258).  
Table 30. Summary and analysis of best overall response rate (BORR) (ITT population) – Part II 
the ORR observed in the ITT population in this study is similar to historically observed ORR of 36.6% when 
bevacizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy [Zhang et al] and to the ORR of 33.8% [Feliu et al], 
38% [Saltz et al], and 44.4% [Bencsikova et al]) when used in combination with XELOX chemotherapy as 
first-line therapy for mCRC patients.  
The ORR observed in the PP population was 41.27% in the Bmab-100 arm and 55.0% in the Avastin arm. No 
statistically significant difference was observed between the two arms (p = 0.1276).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study MYL-1402O-3001, conducted in patients with Stage IV nsNCSLC, was considered pivotal for 
demonstrating therapeutic equivalence in terms of efficacy between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin. 
Supportive efficacy data were derived from study BM100-CC-03-I-01, conducted by Biocon in metastatic CRC 
patients in India with Bmab-100, which is an early development version of MYL-1402O. The study BM100-CC-
03-I-01 is considered as supportive; and regarding the evaluation of efficacy the results are considered as 
informative only. 
Design and conduct of main study 
Demonstration of similarity on efficacy level is based on one pivotal efficacy and safety study. MYL-1402O-
3001 is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group multicentre study to compare the efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity between MYL-1402O (proposed bevacizumab biosimilar) and EU-Avastin in subjects with 
Stage IV unresectable, recurrent or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with negative or unknown activating 
EGFR gene mutations or ALK gene translocations.  
In total 671 patients were 1:1 randomised to receive either MYL-1402O or EU-sourced Avastin. Gender, 
smoking status (smoker or <100 cigarettes in entire life-time) and number of metastasis sites (one site or 
multiple sites) were used as stratification factors. According to the Guideline on adjustment for baseline 
covariates in clinical trials (EMA/CHMP/295050/2013), section 5.2 “Stratification” states that “(…) 
stratification variables, if not solely used for administrative reasons, should usually be included as covariates 
or stratification variables in the primary analysis regardless of their prognostic value”. 
The applicant provided estimated risk difference (RD) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) based 
on Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with stratification factors sex, smoking status, number of metastasis 
sites and newly also with region. RD was -1.57% and corresponding 95% CI was (-9.11%, 5.98%). This was 
similar to result of CMH test where region factor was not considered which led to RD -1.60% and 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 75/125 
 
 
 
 
corresponding 95% CI was (-9.12%, 5.91). This was also similar to unstratified analysis where RD was -
1.60% and corresponding 95% CI was (-9.00%, 5.90%). 
The study was conducted at 89 sites, including more than 90% of patients from non-EU countries. The 
applicant states that the study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki and were consistent with ICH Guidance and the applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. 
Four patients were excluded from per protocol analysis set due to protocol deviation (2 patients in each arm). 
Regarding protocol deviations, it was noted that four patients were excluded from PP set according to major 
protocol deviations. The deviations were set to be defined in the BDR meeting, which was held after the 
database lock and before unblinding the data. The applicant provided the number of patients with protocol 
deviations by 10 categories as defined in SAP, Version 2. All patients with protocol deviations by criteria 1-5 
were excluded from the PP set, deviations of criteria 6-10 were decided on a case-by-case basis. Only 
patients with deviations categorised as major were excluded from the PP set. The applicant confirmed that 
two patients were missed to have major deviations and consequently missed to be excluded from the PP 
analysis. A sensitivity analysis was provided by excluding these two patients with no controversial results. 
In Period 1 of the study, patients received 15 mg/kg bevacizumab concurrently with CP chemotherapy 
(paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6) by iv infusion on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle for up to 6 
cycles (18 weeks). In countries where the initial paclitaxel dose was 175 mg/m2 based on institutional 
protocols, the investigators were allowed to initiate dosing at 175 mg/m2. Dose reduction of chemotherapy 
within predefined dose levels or schedule modifications was permitted for toxicity reasons. If eligible (stable 
disease or better), patients continued with bevacizumab in Period 2 every 3 weeks as monotherapy until 
disease progression, treatment discontinuation (for any reason) or withdrawal of consent. Total duration of 
Period 2 was 24 weeks; overall study duration was thus 42 weeks.  
An Extended Treatment Period provided continued bevacizumab monotherapy to any patient who at Week 42 
had stable disease or better response. During the Extended Treatment Period, a patient received 
bevacizumab until PD, death, unacceptable AE, withdrawal of consent, discontinuation from IMP for any 
reason, or 42 weeks post last patient randomised (i.e. trial closure). 
The general study design was in line with previous scientific advice, except for the study duration. In the EMA 
Scientific Advice received by the applicant in October 2014 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629326/2014), the applicant 
stated that 1-year data would be generated in the pivotal comparative efficacy and safety study, which was 
supported by the CHMP. However, EOS was defined as 42 weeks from the randomisation of the last patient or 
discontinuation of all for study MYL-1402O-3001. Consequently, data up through the Week 42 visit are 
included in the final CSR for the evaluation of secondary efficacy endpoints and of safety and 
immunogenicity. This will be further discussed in Section 2.6 (Clinical Safety). 
The selected population is considered appropriate to sensitively compare efficacy between EU-Avastin and the 
proposed biosimilar candidate. The used treatment regimens for bevacizumab and chemotherapy are in line 
with the Avastin labelling and respective guidances. With regard to the paclitaxel, a dose of 200 mg/m2 is 
outlined in the protocol; however, in countries where the initial dose is 175 mg/m2 based on institutional 
protocols, the investigators are allowed to initiate dosing at 175 instead of 200 mg/m2. The majority of 
patients (69.9%) received the higher initial dose of 200 mg/m2. In addition, the number of patients with the 
different paclitaxel doses was balanced between the treatment arms. In- and exclusion criteria are considered 
appropriate for the chosen population. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were comparable 
between treatment arms. Overall, the same number of subjects in each treatment arm (n=9 per arm) 
discontinued chemotherapy and received bevacizumab monotherapy during the induction period. Up to Cycle 
Assessment report

4, there were no subjects who started bevacizumab monotherapy. At Cycles 4, 5 and 6, the proportion of 
subjects starting maintenance treatment with bevacizumab monotherapy was overall comparable. 
The applicant applies for all therapeutic indications currently authorised for the reference product EU-Avastin. 
Endpoints: 
The primary endpoint was the difference in best overall response rate in the ITT set within 18 weeks, 
assessed by independent review. Secondary endpoints were DCR, PFS, OS and DOR. An equivalence margin 
of ±12.5% for the primary endpoint was calculated.  
The primary efficacy endpoint ORR assessed according to RECIST 1.1 is appropriate for the intended 
biosimilarity exercise and is in line with the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and the Guideline 
on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). ORR at a specific time 
point (at 18 weeks) as primary efficacy endpoint was agreed by CHMP during scientific advice.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The applicant provided the results of the primary efficacy analysis and all other efficacy and safety results up 
to Week 18 with the initial submission. Final Week 42 data were submitted during the procedure. The data 
cut-off date was the date when the last randomised patient had reached or completed the tumour 
assessment scheduled at Week 42.  
With regard to the primary EP, assessment is made by an independent central review for primary analysis, in 
addition to investigator´s analysis, which is supported. The duration of exposure as well as the number of 
doses administered and the cumulative doses for bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel were comparable 
between the treatment arms. With regard to the duration of IMP exposure, the total number of cycles 
received was similar between both treatment arms during the induction period (1627 vs 1626 cycles). For the 
maintenance period, a numerically higher number of treatment cycles was administered in the MYL-1402O 
arm (1278 vs 1242 cycles). This could be attributed mainly to a higher number of patients having received 7 
cycles in the MYL-1402O arm than in the Avastin arm (n=20 vs n=9). 
The difference in best ORR within 18 wks was -1.6 (-9.0, 5.9) for the ITT population, and -2.4 95% CI of (-
10.2, 5.3) for the PP set; the two-sided 95% CI was entirely within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [-
12.5%, 12.5%]. Therefore, formally similarity of efficacy regarding the primary efficacy endpoint has been 
demonstrated. This was supported by sensitivity analyses for the primary EP, e.g. investigator-assessed ORR 
in the ITT population (ORR difference of -2.2, with a 95% CI of -9.7, 5.3) - the results were consistent with 
the primary analysis.  
However, the applicant has defined the primary efficacy endpoint as the difference of best ORR between MYL-
1402O and Avastin during Period 1 by 18 weeks of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. This implies that a 
patient who has a response and afterwards a progression in disease or who even dies would still be counted 
as responder. ORR is considered adequate as primary endpoint, but an evaluation at a specific time point (i.e. 
week 18) is considered more sensitive in a biosimilar application and would be preferred compared to a best 
ORR across all time points (e.g., a patient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD 
on last assessment has a best overall response of PR). Maximizing the ORR over all tumour assessments 
might result in the situation to count a subject as responder even if he dies later on in Period 1. The applicant 
provided analysis of overall response rate (ORR) at week 18 both in ITT and PP set, as requested.

EMA/176217/2021 
Page 77/125 
 
 
 
Calculations for ITT set and PP set were based 1) on independent review and 2) on the investigator’s 
assessment. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the estimated differences in ORR between 
both treatment groups were within equivalence range (-12.5%, 12.5%) in all cases. Namely, 95% CIs for the 
difference in ORR were 1) (-5.8%, 8.7%) in ITT set and (-6.4%, 8.7%) in PP set for independent review and 
2) (-7.4%, 7.3%) in ITT set and (-8.1%, 7.2%) in PP set for the investigator’s assessment. Thus, 
equivalence was concluded. Relevance of equivalence range (-12.5%, 12.5%) for difference in ORR was 
given by justification that ORR at week 18 was considered to be more conservative than the best overall 
response (BOR) at any time during the 18-week period. This implied, by the applicant’s opinion, that 
equivalence range for ORR up to week 18 was also suitable for ORR at week 18. Moreover, the observed 
ORRs at week 18 for MYL-1402O and Avastin were between 35% and 39%. These ORRs were similar to ORR 
of 38% used for sample size calculation. Here, ORR of 38% was based on results from meta-analysis of 4 
studies comparing bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (chemotherapy was either paclitaxel+carboplatin or 
gemcitabine) to chemotherapy alone.  
In addition, it was unclear in how far the primary endpoint has been revised from CSP Version 2.0 to Version 
3.0. Here, the applicant clarified that in the revised protocol Version 3.0, the need for BOR to be confirmed at 
a second time point was deleted for the primary analysis. However, the response rate with confirmation as a 
second time point was retained and presented as sensitivity analysis. The rationale for this revision was the 
data cut-off for the primary endpoint at week 18, implying that BOR might not have been confirmed at a 
second time point in patients having a first objective response at Week 18. Those patients would have been 
counted as non-responders for PE analysis of confirmed BOR due to the early data cut off.  
However, the independent review of the best ORR confirmed at a second time point in the ITT population 
revealed markedly lower ORR rates for both treatment arms (29.1% in the MYL-1402O arm and 30.5% in the 
EU-Avastin arm). The applicant clarified that the independent review process took place once the patient had 
completed imaging for the respective review period (here: from Screening through Wk 18 DCO) and no 
further imaging time points were scheduled. In contrast, the investigator assessed the tumour response upon 
completion of each imaging time point (i.e. Wk 6, 12, 18), thus on a real-time basis. Within this context, 
treatment continuation was dependent on the overall tumour response (imaging plus patient´s clinical 
condition) at a specific time point. 
It is acknowledged that this observed difference in the response rates between independent review and 
investigator assessment is a general limitation that is known and described in literature. Subjective factors 
such as target-lesion selection as well as different interpretations of non-target or immeasurable lesions are 
discussed to be of relevance within this context. 
With regard to the overall lower confirmed response rate as per independent review (29.8%) compared to 
investigator assessment (40.4%), the applicant points out that this might be also attributed to limitations of 
the study design (i.e. the data cut-off defined for the review period for the primary EP). For late responders 
(i.e. patients with first CR or PR at Week 18), BOR could not be confirmed at a second time point; thus they 
were assessed as non-responders for this sensitivity analysis. Within this context, the applicant presents an 
additional analysis for BOR confirmed at a second time point based on independent review, conducted at 
Week 42. This confirmed response analysis based on Week 42 data provides a higher confirmed mean BOR of 
35.0%. 
However, this limitation of the DCO time point at Wk 18 for the primary EP in case of late responders and 
confirmed response analysis would also apply to the investigator-based assessment of confirmed response.  
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 78/125 
 
 
 
Overall, since equivalence was shown between treatment arms in both independent review and investigator 
assessment for BOR as well as for confirmed response, the CHMP considers that there is no critical issue with 
regard to proof of biosimilarity. 
Further results were largely comparable: The number of patients with disease progression (PD), complete 
response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) was similar between treatment arms and also 
between independent review and investigator-based assessment. 
With regard to secondary efficacy endpoints, DCR at week 18 was comparable between treatment arms 
(difference of -4.9, with a 95% CI of -10.5, 0.6).  
The applicant has provided updated PFS and OS analyses with the Week 42 CSR. Based on independent 
review, median PFS at 42 weeks was 7.6 (95% CI: 7.0, 9.5) months in the MYL-1402O arm and 9.0 (95% 
CI: 7.2, 9.7) months in the Avastin arm. This difference was, however, not statistically significant (p-value 
0.0906). When PFS was assessed by the investigator, median PFS was 7.8 (95% CI: 7.0, 9.5) months in the 
MYL-1402O arm and 7.3 (95% CI: 7.0, 8.9) months in the Avastin arm. 
With regard to OS, in the MYL-1402O arm 236 (70.0%) patients survived through Week 42 compared to 252 
(75.4%) patients in the Avastin arm. This difference between the survival curves for both treatment groups 
was not statistically significant (p=0.1185). The OS HR at Week 42 was 1.26 (0.94, 1.69). In addition, the 
median OS was not reached in the ITT population at Week 42. 
It is acknowledged that study MYL-1402O-3001 was primarily designed for ORR analysis at Week 18. 
Although PFS and OS were included as secondary endpoints, the trial was not designed for a mature 
evaluation and was not powered to demonstrate comparability between MYL-1402O and Avastin based on 
those time-to-event endpoints. 
In general, the primary analysis of an equivalence study should be based on a population that is sensitive to 
demonstrate equivalence. Protocol violations may tend to bias the results towards a conclusion of 
equivalence, see ICH E9. Therefore, the PP set is the preferred analysis set for the primary efficacy analysis. 
The applicant defined the ITT population to be the primary efficacy population, which is not endorsed. 
The applicant has provided additional analyses identifying factors such as imbalances in post treatment 
anticancer therapies as well as in deaths occurring within 30 days of first IMP dose, which may have 
contributed to the imbalance in survival rates between the treatment arms.  
As stated in the GL on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical 
and clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), data on survival may have to be interpreted with 
caution due to numerous factors influencing survival beyond the performance of the biosimilar or the 
reference product. OS may not be sensitive enough for establishing comparability, since there may be 
influences by factors not attributable to differences between the biosimilar and the reference product, but by 
factors like tumour burden, performance status, previous lines of treatments, underlying clinical conditions, 
subsequent lines of treatment, etc.  
In addition, the chosen patient population (Stage IV NSCLC patients) may not be ideal for the demonstration 
of clinical comparability. Especially in NSCLC, the clinical course of the disease varies from slowly progressive 
to aggressive profile in patients commonly having several comorbidities, increasing the risk of fatal events. 
This seems to reflect the variable and occasionally unpredictable outcomes seen in clinical practice. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 79/125 
 
 
 
It is acknowledged that, taking into account the results for the primary EP, ORR, supporting efficacy similarity 
between MYL-1402O and Avastin, this imbalance between the treatment arms in the time-to-event endpoints 
PFS and OS does not necessarily preclude conclusion of biosimilarity. 
The applicant has submitted complete DOR results with the Week 42 CSR. Median DOR was comparable 
between the MYL-1402O and the Avastin arm (7.7 vs 6.9 months), which thus supports biosimilarity 
demonstrated in the primary analysis. 
Week 42 Time to First Objective Response data have been provided by the applicant. With the full data set, 
the difference observed between the treatment arms for the Week 0-7 Time to First Objective Response 
diminishes from 3.5% (Week 18 CSR) to 2.0%. In addition, the applicant stresses that in this patient 
population, a maximum objective response would not be expected before 3-4 treatment cycles have been 
administered, which would imply 9-12 weeks. However, the difference of around 2% between the treatment 
arms with regard to Time to First Objective Response results remains more or less consistent over time. 
Another explanation provided by the applicant for the observed imbalance between the treatment arms is 
that for patients who died or discontinued treatment without any post-baseline tumour assessments, Time to 
First Response could not be determined. These early discontinuations occurred more frequently in the MYL-
1402O than in the Avastin arm (11.6% vs 9.3%). Such an imbalance between treatment arms may indeed 
have contributed to the observed difference of -1% to -2%, persisting throughout the study. 
Subgroup analyses revealed no relevant differences for the primary endpoint, except for the subgroup 
receiving prior radiation therapy. Here the observed difference in best ORR between both treatment arms 
was -26.25% (95% CI -47.83, -5.20) with a best ORR of 25.0% in the MYL-1402O arm and of 51.2% in the 
EU-Avastin arm.  The applicant has discussed potential explanations for the observed difference in best ORR 
in the subgroup “prior radiation therapy” between both treatment arms. According to the applicant, the low 
number of patients in this subgroup along with the differences in baseline disease characteristics, an 
imbalance in the prior radiation dose and a higher rate of early discontinuations in the MYL-1402O arm may 
have contributed to the ORR difference observed between treatment arms in this subgroup with prior 
radiation therapy. 
Overall, acknowledging that this is a rather small subgroup as well as that there was no such difference 
observed between the treatment arms in this subgroup of prior radiation therapy with regard to the other 
secondary efficacy parameters PFS, DOR, and OS, this ORR difference is regarded to be not of clinical 
relevance. Additional subgroup analyses using Forest Plots have been provided for the PP set. No distinct 
imbalances between treatment arms have been detected for any of the subgroups analysed, except for the 
subgroup having received prior radiation therapy, consistent with the ITT population. 
With regard to subgroup analysis by age, the ORR differences within the age groups <65, ≥65, <75 and ≥75 
were comparable between the treatment arms.  
Subgroup analysis by geographic region (Europe, India, Southeast Asia) has been performed and revealed no 
differences or imbalances for the primary endpoint. Additional analyses were presented with regard to EU 
versus non-EU countries and showed a slightly higher ORR for MYL-1402O compared to Avastin for the region 
EU-Europe. However, due to the small sample size of this subgroup (n=26 in the MYL-1402O arm vs n=29 in 
the Avastin arm), this seems to be a chance finding and is not considered to be of relevance. 
With regard to results for the primary efficacy EP in the ADA-positive subgroup of patients, best ORR by 18 
weeks was 44.4% (8/18 patients) in the MYL-1402O arm compared to 27.3% (3/11 patients) in the Avastin 
arm. However, it is acknowledged that, overall, the post baseline ADA incidence was low for both treatment 
arms in the NSCLC study (n=18 vs n=11). Importantly, no negative impact of treatment-induced ADA on 
Assessment report

efficacy in terms of ORR could be observed for MYL-1402O (41.5% ORR in the overall ITT population 
compared to 44.4% in the subgroup with treatment-induced ADA’s).  
Supportive study 
A supportive study in patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) was conducted in India with a 
formulation that has the same drug substance and excipients as the reference formulation, according to the 
applicant. It is based on an early development version of MYL-1402O, referred to as Bmab-100. Therefore, 
efficacy data from this study are considered as supportive only.  
Study BM100-CC-03-I-01 was a double blind, randomised, active controlled, parallel design, comparative PK, 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity study of Bmab-100 and Avastin, both in combination with oxaliplatin-
capecitabine (XELOX) chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Primary objective was to 
demonstrate PK bioequivalence of Bmab-100 and Avastin. 
The applicant clarified that EU-Avastin was used as reference medicinal product in study BM100-CC-03-I-01. 
It was confirmed that one EU-Avastin batch was used in this study, as stated in the CSR. The batch certificate 
for the same batch has also been submitted. 
The study had two parts (1 and 2). The objective of Part 1 was to generate the safety data of infusion-related 
reactions of the first dose of Bmab-100 when given with XELOX chemotherapy in 10 patients. 
Part 2 of the study was a double-blind, randomised, active controlled, parallel arm study in patients with 
mCRC. Only first line mCRC patients were included. Patients received Bmab-100 or Avastin at 7.5 mg/kg 
along with XELOX chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles. Each cycle consisted of a 21 day period. As a whole, the 
study consisted of 21 days screening period, 15 weeks treatment period, followed by a 3 week follow up. The 
End of the Study evaluation was performed at the end of 18 weeks. Wherever possible, radiological 
assessments were performed 4-6 weeks after the EOS (Post EOS) in patients with first documentation of 
response (PR or CR at EOS). 
Efficacy was the secondary objective of the study. The efficacy objective was to evaluate and compare the 
effect of Bmab-100 and Avastin, in combination with XELOX chemotherapy on: 
- Overall response rate based on RECIST 1.1 criteria 
- PFS rate at 18 weeks. 
- DCR rate at 18 weeks 
The efficacy analyses were performed on the basis of tumour response evaluation by independent, blinded 
and centralised radiological evaluation according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines for radiological assessment of 
tumours. 
Although no statistically significant differences were observed with regard to best ORR within 18 weeks in 
both the ITT and the PP population, there were higher numbers of subjects with PR in the Avastin arm 
(n=32) than in the Bmab-100 arm (n=25). Furthermore, considerably more subjects in the Bmab-100 arm 
had SD (n=36) compared to the Avastin arm (n=27). 
Thus, overall no clear conclusion can be drawn from the submitted supportive efficacy data in terms of best 
ORR within 18 weeks with regard to biosimilarity of Bmab-100 and Avastin or, still less, of MYL-1402O and 
EU-Avastin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 81/125 
 
 
 
With regard to the other efficacy endpoints that were evaluated in this study, DCR was comparable between 
the two study arms (Bmab-100 91.18% versus Avastin 88.24%), as well as the PFS rate at 18 weeks (Bmab-
100 61.76% versus Avastin 60.29%).  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
there are no concerns regarding similarity of efficacy.  
In the pivotal comparative efficacy study MYL-1402O-3001 in Stage IV nsNSCLC patients, equivalence 
between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin was demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint, best ORR within 18 
weeks, assessed by independent review in the ITT population. This was supported by sensitivity analyses for 
the primary EP in the PP population, which is the population of interest for a biosimilar. 
In addition, post-hoc sensitivity analyses have been provided for ORR at week 18, which is considered a more 
sensitive endpoint for a biosimilarity exercise than the BOR at any time point during the 18-week induction 
period. ORR rates at week 18 were similar between the treatment arms, both in the ITT and PP set, based on 
independent review as well as on investigator assessment. Overall, the presented additional ORR analyses at 
week 18 indicate similar efficacy between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin and do thus support the results from 
the primary analysis. 
In summary, biosimilarity on efficacy level can be concluded from the data submitted. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety of MYL-1402O has been evaluated in 2 clinical comparative studies (studies MYL-1402O-1002 and 
MYL-1402O-3001). Study MYL-1402O-1002 was completed, whereas for study MYL-1402O-3001, data from 
Period 1 (up to 18 weeks) were the basis for initial assessment and the final Week 42 data were submitted 
during the procedure. 
Study MYL-1402O-1002 (Phase I PK in healthy volunteers) 
The Safety Set consisted of all subjects who were randomised and had received at least 1 dose of 
bevacizumab (n= 111). 
This was a single centre study, conducted in the Netherlands. 
Safety Endpoints: 
Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, 
infusion site local tolerance, presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in serum (immunogenicity). 
Study MYL-1402O-3001 (Phase III efficacy + safety in nsNSCLC patients) 
A multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of MYL-1402O 
compared with Avastin, in the first-line treatment of patients with Stage IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell 
Lung Cancer (nsNSCLC). The Safety Set consisted of all patients who were randomised and had received at 
least 1 dose of bevacizumab (MYL-1402O or EU-Avastin, n= 664 patients). The whole study duration was 42 
weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 82/125 
 
 
 
This multicentre study was conducted at sites in Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, 
Hungary, India, Italy, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and 
Vietnam. 
Safety Endpoints: 
- Incidence, nature, and severity of AEs including ADRs graded according to CTCAE. 
- Detection of antibodies to bevacizumab. 
In addition, a supportive clinical study (BM100-CC-03-I-01) was conducted with Bmab-100 by Mylan’s 
development partner Biocon. This study has been completed. 
Study BM100-CC-03-I-01 (supportive Phase III study in mCRC patients) 
The study had two parts (1 and 2). The objective of Part 1 of the study was to generate safety data on 
infusion-related reactions of the first dose of Bmab-100 when given with XELOX chemotherapy in 10 patients. 
The safety objectives were included in Part 2 of the study. The Safety Set consisted of all subjects who were 
randomised and had received at least 1 dose of bevacizumab (n= 135). 
Safety Endpoints: 
- Evaluation of comparative safety of Bmab-100 and Avastin (over 18 weeks) 
- Evaluation of incidence and titres of ADA for Bmab-100 and Avastin (over 18 weeks) 
Safety data from the clinical studies were not pooled.  
- The study populations were different. The Phase I PK study MYL-1402O-1002 was conducted in healthy 
male volunteers, the Phase III efficacy and safety study MYL-1402O-3001 was performed in NSCLC patients.  
- Different study protocols and thus, treatment schemes were used in both trials. In the Phase I study one 
single dose of 1 mg/kg bevacizumab was administered iv to the study participants, in the Phase III study 
repeated doses (every 3 weeks) of 15 mg/kg bevacizumab were administered iv to the patients, first 
concomitantly with carboplatin/ paclitaxel during Period 1, then as monotherapy during Period 2 of the trial. 
- The two patient-based studies were conducted in patients with different tumour indications and with 
different chemotherapeutic regimens. 
Avastin has a well characterised safety profile and an extensive post-marketing data base. Hence, the sample 
sizes of the Phase I and Phase III studies are considered acceptable to detect relevant safety signals.  
It is noted that the final CSR includes only Week 42 data. This in contrast to the EMA SA received by the 
applicant in October 2014, where the applicant stated that 1-year data would be generated in the pivotal 
phase III study, which was supported by the CHMP. The applicant provided justification on the deviation in 
the context of safety follow-up period for which the data is submitted (42 weeks instead of 1-year data). This 
is based on the amendment to the study protocol (from version 1.0 to version 2.0). Moreover, the applicant 
presented data available beyond Week 42 for the patients who entered extended treatment period (i.e. 86 
patients from the MYL-1402O group and 84 patients from the Avastin group).  
It is stated by the applicant that during the manufacturing of the development batches of MYL-1402O, one 
formulation buffer component was changed. Instead of sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, sodium 
dihydrogen phosphate dehydrate was erroneously used. Since the manufacturing process was based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 83/125 
 
 
 
 
monohydrate, the buffer quantity was not adjusted for dihydrate (i.e. molecular weight of 137.8 was used 
instead of 156). This inadvertent change resulted in small differences with regard to pH and osmolality. It 
was outlined by the applicant that the product quality with dihydrate buffer in terms of stability or other key 
product attributes were not impacted. 
The formulation used in the completed as well as in the ongoing clinical studies (including the supportive 
study conducted with Bmab-100 in India by Biocon) contained sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Also, 
the commercialised product in India contained the dihydrate salt. Since the product intended to be marketed 
in the EU is also based on the dihydrate salt, the data submitted are considered relevant for the evaluation of 
safety and immunogenicity of MYL-1402O.  
Patient exposure 
Table 32. Overall exposure of the study drug 
Phase I PK study 
The Safety Set consisted of all 111 healthy male subjects who were randomised and who received a single 
dose of 1 mg/kg bevacizumab. The overall extent of exposure was similar between the three treatment arms 
(n= 37 per treatment arm). Of the 111 subjects who received the IMP, all completed the trial and no subjects 
discontinued. 
Table 33. Extent of exposure 
The Phase I study included only healthy male subjects as agreed upon in previous EMA scientific advice. The 
subjects were aged 18 to 55 years. The majority of healthy volunteers were White. The mean age of study 
participants was 31 years.

Table 34. Summary of demographic characteristics (SAF set) 
Phase III NSCLC study 
The Safety Set comprised all patients who received bevacizumab (15 mg/kg iv) at least once. Hence, a total 
of 664 out of the 671 randomised patients were included in the Safety Set (MYL-1402O group: 335 patients 
[99.4%]; EU-Avastin group: 329 patients [98.5%]). 
Table 35. Exposure of investigational medicinal products: safety set 
The mean duration of exposure to bevacizumab during Period 1 was comparable between MYL-1402O (15.6 
weeks) and EU-Avastin (15.8 weeks), as well as the mean number of doses (MYL-1402O 4.9 versus EU-
Avastin 5.0) and the mean cumulative doses (MYL-1402O 74.8 versus EU-Avastin 75.7). Based on the full 
Week 42 data set, the mean duration of exposure to bevacizumab was comparable between MYL-1402O 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 85/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(15.13 weeks) and EU-Avastin (14.65 weeks), as well as the mean number of doses (8.7 for both treatment 
arms) and the mean cumulative doses (MYL-1402O 131.0 mg/kg versus EU-Avastin 131.8 mg/kg). 
In both study periods, a comparable number of cycles was overall administered across all patients in both 
treatment arms, with a slightly lower number of cycles administered in Period 2 for Avastin (n=1242) than 
for MYL-1402O (n=1278). 
With regard to chemotherapy, the mean duration of exposure to carboplatin during Period 1 was comparable 
between MYL-1402O (15.3 weeks) and EU-Avastin (15.6 weeks), as well as the mean number of doses (MYL-
1402O 4.8 versus EU-Avastin 4.9) and the mean cumulative doses (MYL-1402O 3171.8 versus EU-Avastin 
3289.8). The mean duration of exposure to paclitaxel during Period 1 was comparable between MYL-1402O 
(15.4 weeks) and EU-Avastin (15.6 weeks), as well as the mean number of doses (MYL-1402O 4.9 versus 
EU-Avastin 4.9) and the mean cumulative doses (MYL-1402O 1641.7 versus EU-Avastin 1732.2).  
Table 36. Dose delays of IMP safety set 
In the Phase III study in NSCLC patients, the mean age of the patients was 59.3 (SD 9.60) years in the MYL-
1402O and 59.2 years (SD 9.73) in the EU-Avastin treatment arm. 70.3% of the patients in the MYL-1402O 
and 70.7% of the patients in the EU-Avastin arm were < 65 years old. Both treatment groups were thus 
comparable with regard to the age of the patients included.  
Gender, smoking status, and number of metastasis sites were used for stratification.  
In both treatment groups, the majority of the patients was White: 67.1% (226 patients) in the MYL-1402O 
treatment group and 69.5% (232 patients) in the EU-Avastin group. 111 (32.9%) patients in the MYL-1402O 
group and 102 (30.5 %) patients in the EU-Avastin group were Asians. No patients were Black or African 
American. In the MYL-1402O arm, 5 (1.5%) patients were Hispanic or Latino, and 4 (1.2%) in the EU-Avastin 
arm. 
More than 90% of the patients included in the trial were non-EU citizens. Only 8.2% of study participants 
were EU citizens. 59.8% were recruited from Non-EU countries, and 32.0% were from Asia. The proportion of 
EU citizens was comparable for both treatment arms. 
With regard to medical history, both treatment arms were comparable. The majority of patients had at least 
1 medical condition in their history. The most commonly reported medical history disorders (>25% of total) 
were in the SOC of Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders (MYL-1402O 41.8% and Avastin 42.5%); 
Vascular disorders (MYL-1402O 39.5% and Avastin 33.5%); and Gastrointestinal disorders (MYL-1402O 
28.5% and Avastin 29.9%). 
Baseline disease characteristics were comparable between the two treatment arms. However, there were 
slightly higher proportion of patients with M1C substage in the MYL-1402O arm, 125 (37.1%) patients

compared to 117 (35.0%) patients in the Avastin arm. However, all the patients were in Stage IV at the time 
of randomisation into the study, as per protocol requirement. 
Supportive Phase III mCRC study 
The Safety Set consisted of 135 patients. Overall, 68 mCRC patients were exposed to Bmab-100 and 67 
patients were exposed to Avastin. 
In both study arms, 63.23% patients completed the study and the rest (36.76%) was prematurely 
discontinued.  
The mean cumulative dose (1.93 g for Bmab-100 versus 2.09 g for Avastin) and the mean duration of 
exposure (104.9 days versus 109.5 days) were comparable between the treatment arms. In addition, the 
mean number as well as the median number of cycles received were comparable for both treatment arms. 
Table 37. Study drug exposure 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics as well as the medical history were comparable between 
the treatment arms. 
Adverse events 
Phase I PK study 
In the Phase I PK study in healthy male subjects, the proportion of subjects who experienced a TEAE, as well 
as the number of TEAEs, was lower in the EU-Avastin group (29/37 subjects [78%] and 99 TEAEs) and in the 
US-Avastin group (28/37 subjects [76%] and 98 TEAEs) than in the MYL-1402O arm (33/37 subjects [89%] 
and 116 TEAEs).

Table 38. Overview of treatment-emergent adverse events during the study 
All of the TEAEs were Grade 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) in severity, with a higher number of Grade 1 (mild) 
TEAEs in the MYL-1402O arm (113 TEAEs) than in the EU-Avastin arm (93 TEAEs) or in the US-Avastin arm 
(85 TEAEs). 
The most frequently reported TEAE was headache in all treatment arms (MYL-1402O 19% [7/37 subjects], 
US-Avastin 16% [6/37], EU-Avastin 24% [9/37]).

Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 88/125 
 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently affected SOCs among the treatment groups were Gastrointestinal disorders and Nervous 
System disorders. The incidence of TEAEs categorised by SOC was overall comparable among the MYL-
1402O, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin treatment groups.  
However, there were differences in the incidence of TEAEs between the treatment arms for catheter site 
erythema, pain in extremity, nasopharyngitis and hematoma (blood sampling arm). Notably, there were no 
PTs with at least a 10% absolute difference between TEAEs in both the EU- or US-Avastin groups vs the MYL-
1402O group. The differences in incidence rates between treatment groups are thus not considered of clinical 
relevance.  
No TEAES of Grade 3 (severe) or higher in severity and no discontinuations due to TEAEs during the study 
occurred in any of the treatment arms. 
TEAEs considered to be related to the IMP were reported in 17 subjects in the MYL-1402O treatment group, 
in 19 subjects in the EU-Avastin treatment group and in 12 subjects in the US-Avastin treatment group.

relationship 
Assessment report

The most common related TEAEs by PT reported by ≥5% of the subjects were headache (16%; 16% in the 
MYL-1402O group, 11% in the US-Avastin group and 22% in the EU-Avastin group), diarrhoea (5%; 3% in 
the MYL-1402O group, 11% in the US-Avastin group and 3% in the EU-Avastin group), abdominal pain (5%; 
3% in the MYL-1402O group, 3% in the US-Avastin group and 8% in the EU-Avastin group), and frequent 
bowel movements (5%; 3% in the MYL-1402O group, 5% in the US-Avastin group and 5% in the EU-Avastin 
group), all of them being consistent with the SmPC of Avastin except for frequent bowel movements, which 
however belong to the frequently affected SOC “Gastrointestinal disorders”.  
Overall, the proportion of patients experiencing TEAEs is deemed comparable between the three treatment 
arms; no clinically meaningful differences were noticed. No new safety concerns came up. Also the number of 
subjects with TEAEs as per SOC and PT are largely similar and do not indicate clinically relevant differences in 
safety between MYL-1402O, EU-Avastin and US-Avastin administered as a single dose of 1 mg/kg iv to 
healthy subjects.  
Phase III NSCLC study 
In the Phase III pivotal study in nsNSCLC patients, a total of 605 patients (91.1%) reported 3679 TEAEs at 
any time after the first dose of the IMP during the overall study period. The overall number of patients 
experiencing TEAEs in the Phase III study is similar between both treatment groups (n= 306 [91.3%] in the 
MYL-1402O arm and 90.9% [299] in the EU-Avastin arm). The number of TEAEs reported is, however, higher 
in the MYL-1402O group (1918 TEAEs), compared to the EU-Avastin group (1761 TEAEs). The overall 
incidence of TEAEs was markedly lower in Period 2 than in Period 1 (57.1% vs 91.1%).  
For Period 2, the incidence of TEAE was numerically higher in the Avastin arm (n=122 patients [61.3] vs 
n=106 [53.0%]). However, the overall number of events was numerically higher in the MYL-1402 arm (328 
events) than in the Avastin arm (319 events). It is acknowledged that overall those numerical imbalances are 
considered not of clinical relevance, against the background that for the categories treatment-related TEAE, 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs, SAE, treatment-related SAE, and TEAE leading to discontinuation, and treatment-related 
TEAE leading to discontinuation the incidences were comparable between the treatment arms in the 
monotherapy period.

Table 42. TEAEs by severity in Period 2: safety set 
A higher number of fatal TEAEs occurred in the MYL-1402O group compared to the EU-Avastin group. Please 
refer to Section “SAE and deaths” for further assessment.  
Table 43. Treatment-emergent adverse events by severity: safety set 
The most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC were Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, reported in 326 
(49.1%) patients, Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders reported in 316 (47.4%) patients, Nervous System 
Disorders reported in 219 (33.0%) patients and Gastrointestinal Disorders reported in 210 (31.6%) patients. 
The most frequently occurring TEAEs at PT level were alopecia (MYL-1402O, 148 [44.2%] vs Avastin, 168 
[51.1%] patients), followed by anaemia (MYL-1402O, 91 [27.2%] vs Avastin, 77 [23.4 %] patients) and 
thrombocytopenia (MYL-1402O, 91 [27.2%]. vs Avastin, 77 [23.4%] patients), all of which were expected 
AEs in patients receiving chemotherapy. 
When focussing on the TEAE (by SOC and PT) occurring more frequent in the MYL-1402O arm than in the 
Avastin arm, the imbalances between the treatment arms were observed for the SOCs General disorders and 
administration site conditions, Gastrointestinal disorders, and Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders during 
Period 1. However, there was no clear pattern or clustering by any SOC/PT detectable.

During Period 2 (i.e. monotherapy with bevacizumab), no distinct differences between the treatment arms 
with regard to TEAE incidences sorted by SOCs could be detected.

Table 45. Related TEAEs (in ≥3 patients by PT) – safety set 
There were minor differences in the related TEAEs by PT: diarrhoea occurred in 20 (6.0%) patients in the 
MYL-1402O arm compared with 12 (3.6%) patients in Avastin arm, and epistaxis occurred in 5 (1.5%) 
patients in MYL-1402O arm compared with 15 (4.6%) patients in Avastin arm. Both diarrhoea and epistaxis 
are commonly reported known ADRs with bevacizumab. The isolated numerical differences in incidences 
between the treatment groups are not considered to be of clinical relevance. 
A total of 52 (7.8%) patients discontinued treatment due to TEAE; 30 (9.0%) and 22 (6.7%) in the MYL-
1402O and Avastin arms, respectively, during Period 1. The number of patients who reported treatment-
Assessment report

related TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation was comparable in both arms, 13 (3.9%) in MYL-1402O 
arm versus 13 (4.0%) in Avastin arm. In Period 2, there were 2 patients in the MYL-1402O group (1.0%) and 
3 patients in the Avastin group (1.5%) who discontinued treatment due to treatment-related TEAE. 
Of note, for the MYL-1402O, there were 2 concerned events which are not considered “listed” for the known 
safety profile of bevacizumab, i.e. cardiorespiratory arrest and acute angle closure glaucoma. Based on the 
submitted narrative, one patient who experienced cardiorespiratory arrest came from India and was 57 years 
old. He received only one dose of study drug (720 mg), paclitaxel (259 mg) and carboplatin (702 mg). On 
Day 4, he had severe bone marrow toxicity (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) and there were likely multiple 
contributing factors (e.g. carboplatin dose was too high considering the patient weight of 49 kg, “late effects” 
from radiation). According to the Investigator, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia could have led to a 
cardiovascular accident leading to terminal cardiorespiratory arrest. Another patient who experienced angle 
closure glaucoma also came from India and was 51 years old. This patient also received only one dose of 
study drug (660 mg), paclitaxel (229 mg) and carboplatin (612 mg). On Day 7, she was diagnosed with 
conjunctivitis (grade 2) and on Day 9 she experienced blurring of vision of the left eye, redness and pain in 
both eyes. The eye examination showed acute angle closure glaucoma with conjunctivitis (grade 3) and CT 
scan showed brain lesions, therefore, the patient was discontinued from the study. In view of the provided 
information, no impact on safety of MYL-1402O and related conclusions on safety profile can be detected. 
The number of patients with AESI by SMQ was comparable between the treatment arms (16.1% in the MYL-
1402O vs 20.1% in the EU-Avastin arm) in Period 1. The number of patients with Grade ≥3 AESI and serious 
AESI was also comparable between the treatment arms. 
There were differences between the study arms with regard to the AESIs epistaxis and haemoptysis: a lower 
number of patients experienced epistaxis as an AESI in the MYL-1402O arm (5 [1.5%]) compared with the 
Avastin arm (17 [5.2%]), as well as haemoptysis (2 [0.6%]) in the MYL-1402O arm and 6 [1.8%] in the 
Avastin arm). Most of the reported AEIs were of Grade 1-2 only.

in MYL-1402O arm and 19 (5.8%) in Avastin arm All serious AESIs, including haemoptysis, were comparable 
between the treatment arms.  
In Period 2, the incidence of AESI was lower compared to Period 1 (overall n=37 vs n=120 subjects with at 
least one event). Importantly, the AESI incidence was comparable between the treatment arms in the 
monotherapy period (n=21 [10.5%] in MYL-1402O vs n=16 [8.0%] in Avastin arm), also with regard to 
Grade ≥3 AESI (n=4 [2.0%] in the MYL-1402O vs n=5 [2.5%] in Avastin arm).  
According to the Avastin SmPC, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions is reported 
to be common in clinical trials where Avastin was given in combination with chemotherapy (up to 5% 
incidence in bevacizmab-treated patients). The applicant clarified that infusion-related reactions were 
captured under the MedDRA SMQ of Hypersensitivity, which had been defined as AESI for study MYL-1402O

3001. Overall, up to Week 42, the incidence of Hypersensitivity AESI was low and comparable between 
treatment arms (reported in overall n=15 [2.3%] of patients, n=9 in MYL-1402O and n=6 in Avastin arm).  
Most of the Hypersensitivity AESI occurred during Period 1 (in n=13 patients [2.0%]). Here, 8 events were 
reported for the MYL-1402O arm and 5 events for the Avastin arm. Most events (n=6) were captured under 
the PT Dermatitis allergic. Only 1 PT of Hypersensitivity was reported in the MYL-1402O arm, and 1 PT of 
Anaphylactic reaction was reported in the Avastin arm; both were Grade ≥3. During Period 2, 
Hypersensitivity AESI occurred only in 2 patients (1 PT of Dermatitis allergic in the MYL-1402O arm and 1 PT 
of Swelling face in the Avastin arm). 
Supportive Phase III mCRC study 
In the supportive Phase III study in mCRC patients, the overall incidence of TEAEs was slightly higher in the 
Avastin arm as compared to Bmab-100 arm. 54 (79.41%) patients in the Bmab-100 arm and 60 (89.55%) 
patients in the Avastin arm reported at least one TEAE. Most of the TEAEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity.

Table 49. Overview of treatment emergent adverse events by severity 
Most of the TEAEs were considered not related to study drug and instead related to chemotherapy (XELOX) 
or underlying disease or progression. Six (8.82%) patients in the Bmab-100 arm and 12 (17.91%) patients in 
the Avastin arm had at least 1 TEAE related to Bmab-100/Avastin. 
Overall, the most commonly reported TEAE in the study was diarrhoea, reported in 11 (16.17%) patients (17 
events, including one bacterial diarrhoea) in the Bmab-100 arm and 22 (32.84%) patients (35 events) in the 
Avastin arm. The other frequently reported TEAEs (> 10% incidence) were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
syndrome, vomiting and asthenia. 
In the CSR for study Bm100-CC-03-I-01, it is stated that diarrhoea was reported in 11 patients (16.17%) in 
the Bmab-100 arm (16 events). However, it is depicted that 10 patients (14.71%) experienced 16 events of 
diarrhoea. The applicant has clarified that, overall, there were 17 events of diarrhoea occurring in study 
BM100-CC-03-I-01. However, one event of bacterial diarrhoea was not included, since this table presented 
TEAE’s occurring in >5% by treatment group. Therefore, the event of bacterial diarrhoea, captured under the 
SOC ‘Infection and infestation’ instead of ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’, fell under the cut-off of 5% and thus 
was not included.  
The most frequently reported drug-related TEAE in the study was anaemia reported by 4 (5.88%) patients in 
the Bmab-100 arm and 3 (4.48%) patients Avastin arm. 
Altogether, across both treatment groups, the incidences, types and severities of TEAE are considered 
comparable and thus supportive for the MYL-1402O MAA. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Phase I PK study 
There were no serious AEs or deaths reported in the study. 
Phase III NSCLC study 
From the data provided, it seems that across both treatment groups, the incidences and types the SAEs were 
generally comparable, with no clinically meaningful differences noticed between both treatment groups.  
Overall, 142 SAEs were reported, all of which were treatment-emergent (i.e. serious TEAEs). The proportion 
of patients experiencing SAEs was comparable between both treatment groups. Hence, in the MYL-1402O 
treatment arm, 75 SAEs were reported in 52/335 (15.5%) subjects and in the EU-Avastin arm, 67 SAEs were 
reported in 47/329 (14.3%) subjects. However, SAE with fatal outcome were more frequent in the MYL-
1402O arm (n=22) compared to the Avastin arm (n=13).  
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 98/125 
 
 
 
 
Most of the SAE (82 out of 142 events) recovered or resolved – 40 in the MYL-1402O arm and 42 in the 
Avastin arm. The majority of those SAE resolved without any action taken. However, 10 SAE required study 
drug interruption (8 in the MYL-1402O arm vs 2 in the Avastin arm), 14 SAE resulted study drug 
discontinuation (7 in each arm). 8 SAE recovered with sequelae (3 in the MYL-1402O arm vs 5 in the Avastin 
arm). 17 SAE were reported as not recovered or resolved at the end of Week 42 (10 in the MYL-1402O arm 
and 7 in the Avastin arm) -  14 patients died (due to another SAE or disease progression; 10 vs 4), 3 SAE in 
the Avastin arm were reported as ongoing at last follow up (events of Grade 3 pulmonary thrombosis, Grade 
4 pulmonary embolism, and Grade 3 anaemia).  
In addition, there were another 17 SAE (9 in the MYL-1402O arm versus 8 in the Avastin arm) in 13 patients 
(5 vs 8) that occurred during Period 1 after the DCO for the Week 18 CSR. 5 of those SAE in overall 3 
patients (2 in MYL-1402O arm and 1 in Avastin arm) had fatal outcome. 6 SAE resolved without any action 
taken. 3 SAE required study drug interruption. 1 SAE recovered with sequelae, and 2 SAE were reported as 
not recovered (1 leading to treatment discontinuation, 1 in which death was reported).  
For Period 2, a total of 10 SAE was reported, 5 in each study arm. 2 SAE in the MYL-1402O arm (one of 
cardiac arrest and one of pulmonary haemorrhage, both assessed as treatment-related) had fatal outcome. 
The majority of 7 events recovered during Period 2. 2 SAE, one in each treatment arm, required study drug 
interruption. 3 SAEs (1 in MYL-1402O arm, 2 in Avastin arm) resulted in permanent discontinuation of 
treatment. 1 event was reported as not recovered in the Week 42 CSR. However, this event recovered after 
the DCO for the CSR. 
Overall, a distinctly higher incidence of SAE was observed during Period 1 (i.e. bevacizumab in combination 
with ChT) than during the monotherapy period with bevacizumab treatment alone (142 [+ 17] vs. 10 
events). Here, the applicant discusses underlying comorbidities as well as ChT-induced toxicity during the 
combination therapy period as possible explanations. This is acknowledged.  
Importantly, during the monotherapy period, SAE incidence was low and similar for MYL-1402O and for 
Avastin. 
The most frequently affected SOCs for SAEs were Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (5.7% in 
the MYL-1402O and 4.6% in the EU-Avastin arm), followed by Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (5.1% 
and 4.0%, respectively, and Infections and Infestations (3.9% and 2.7%, respectively). The most frequently 
occurring SAEs at the PT level were Febrile Neutropenia (1.8% and 1.5%, respectively), Thrombocytopenia 
(1.5% in both treatment arms), and Pulmonary Embolism (1.2% in both treatment arms). This is generally in 
line with the known safety profile of bevacizumab.

Table 50. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events (≥2 patients per PT) by SOC and PT – 
safety set 
With regard to treatment-related SAEs, there was a higher number of patients in the Avastin arm (n=22) 
than in the MYL-1402O arm (n=17) during Period 1 reporting a higher number of treatment-related SAEs (30 
vs 21 events). The most frequently reported treatment-related SAEs by PT were pulmonary embolism (n=4 
in each treatment arm), thrombocytopenia (n=3 in the Avastin arm, n=1 for MYL-1402O), and febrile 
neutropenia (n=3 in the Avastin arm). 
In Period 2, the number of patients experiencing treatment-related SAE was similar between the treatment 
groups (n=2 patients per treatment arm). Furthermore, the incidence of related SAE was overall low and 
similar (n=2 events per group). Here, the following events (by PT) were reported: coronary artery disease, 
myocardial infarction, pulmonary haemorrhage, and hypertension.

Overall, there were 183 deaths reported during the study, with 101 deaths in the MYL-1402O arm and 82 
deaths in the Avastin arm. 
Importantly, the imbalance with regard to the number of deaths remained rather stable between the 
treatment arms throughout the study. The numerical difference in deaths between the treatment arms 
increased slightly from n=16 (Week 18 CSR, with 50 versus 34 deaths for the MYL-1402O arm vs Avastin) to 
n=19 (Week 42 CSR, with 101 versus 82 deaths for MYL-1402O vs Avastin).

patient died due to suspected disease progression and 1 patient due to suicide, 1 patients in Avastin arm died at home with dyspnoea as the 
only symptom reported at the time of death 
The majority of the deaths was due to disease progression. Here, no imbalance was observed between the 
treatment arms (n=57 in the MYL-1402O arm vs n=56 in the Avastin arm)  
The number of non-cancer related deaths (i.e. due to TEAE and unknown) was, however, higher in the MYL-
1402O arm (n=41) than in the Avastin arm (n=25). 
25 patients in the MYL-1402O arm compared to 14 patients in the Avastin arm experienced TEAE leading to 
death. However, most of these TEAE leading to death were not classified as treatment-related – only 8 
deaths in the MYL-1402O arm and 5 deaths in the Avastin arm were associated with a treatment-related 
TEAE, most of them (n=11) occurred during Period 1. These drug related TEAEs which occurred in the MYL-
1402O group were the following: pulmonary embolism (in 2 patients), pulmonary haemorrhage (in 2 
patients), cardiorespiratory arrest, acute coronary syndrome, gastric perforation and cerebrovascular 
accident. With the exception of cardiorespiratory arrest and acute coronary syndrome, the reported events 
are listed in the product information for Avastin. In case of the event of acute coronary syndrome, the 
Investigator assessed this event as possibly related to study drug, paclitaxel and carboplatin. The patient 
received the only dose of study drug (690 mg), paclitaxel (254 mg) and carboplatin (480 mg) and died by 
Day 30. The immediate cause of death was assessed as lung cancer with metastases, acute coronary 
syndrome with severe left ventricular dysfunction as antecedent cause and hypertension as other significant 
condition contributing to the fatal outcome. The patient who experienced cardiorespiratory arrest received 
only one dose of study drug (720 mg), paclitaxel (259 mg) and carboplatin (702 mg). On Day 4, he had 
severe bone marrow toxicity (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) and there were likely multiple contributing

factors (e.g. carboplatin dose was too high considering the patient weight of 49 kg, “late effects” from 
radiation). According to the Investigator, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia could have led to a 
cardiovascular accident leading to terminal cardiorespiratory arrest. 
During Period 2 (i.e. monotherapy with bevacizumab), only 1 treatment-related TEAE of pulmonary 
haemorrhage leading to death was reported in the MYL-1402O arm.  
Since a significantly higher number of IMP-related TEAEs leading to death occurred during the combination 
therapy, it is acknowledged that this might be attributed to chemotherapy-induced toxicity rather than 
bevacizumab-induced toxicity alone.  
This is supported by the fact that most of the reported Grade 5 TEAEs are known to occur in the setting of 
advanced NSCLC as well as with the combination of ChT and bevacizumab (e.g. pulmonary embolism, 
pulmonary hemorrhage, cardiorespiratory arrest, acute coronary syndrome, febrile neutropenia, gastric 
perforation, sepsis, cerebrovascular accident).  
Furthermore, following a review on a case by case basis, no trend or significant safety-related concern with 
regard to the study drug could be identified.

Supportive Phase III mCRC study 
In the supportive Phase III study in mCRC patients, 42 SAEs were reported in 31 patients, of which 5 were 
related to the study drug. 16 (23.53%) patients in the Bmab-100 arm reported 18 treatment-emergent SAEs, 
and 15 (22.39%) patients in the Avastin arm reported 24 treatment-emergent SAEs. The SAEs constituted 
events expected from the known safety profile of Avastin. Most were assessed to be related to other 
confounding factors like XELOX chemotherapy and underlying disease. 
Thirteen deaths were reported (Bmab-100 arm: 5 and Avastin arm: 8). Of these, 2 deaths were attributed to 
TEAEs related to study drug (1 event in each arm).

Laboratory findings 
there was no evidence of clinically relevant differences in any laboratory parameter between the three 
treatment groups over time in the Phase I study, between the two treatment arms in the Phase III nsNSCLC 
study, and between the three treatment arms in the supportive Phase III mCRC study. 
For study MYL-1402O-3001, no clinically significant differences between treatment groups were observed in 
hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis results, vital signs, physical examination findings, or ECOG status 
from baseline through Week 18.  
With regard to liver function parameters, there were elevations in post-baseline values detected for ALT and 
for total bilirubin in a higher number of patients in the MYL-1402O arm than in the Avastin arm.  
Overall, 2 patients in the MYL-1402O arm as well as 1 patient in the Avastin arm had concurrent elevation of 
ALT ≥3 and bilirubin ≥2ULN. The 2 patients in the MYL-1402O arm had Stage IV NSCLC with liver metastasis 
at baseline, whereas the patient in the Avastin arm had Stage IV NSCLC without liver metastasis at baseline. 
All patients were discontinued from treatment due to PD. Since the study population comprised patients with 
other comorbidities for which they were receiving concomitant medications, it is acknowledged that it is 
rather difficult to attribute liver enzyme elevations or clinically apparent liver injury to any of the IMPs.  
When comparing the number of patients by treatment arm who showed CTCAE grade shift in ALT from 
baseline to worst post-baseline during the study, an imbalance between the treatment arms was observed: 
15 patients in the MYL-1402O arm versus 7 patients in the Avastin arm showed a post-baseline shift to Grade 
2 ALT. With regard to post-BL shifts to Grade 3 ALT, there was no distinct difference between the treatment 
arms. Furthermore, no patients had post-BL shifts to Grade 4 ALT in either treatment arm.  
With regard to bilirubin post-baseline shifts, there were no distinct imbalances observed between the 
treatment arms, except for post-BL shift to Grade 3 bilirubin from baseline, which occurred in 3 patients in 
the MYL-1402O arm and in 1 patient in the Avastin arm.  
With regard to the overall study population at baseline, a higher number of patients in the MYL-1402O arm 
had Grade 1 ALT elevation (n=44) compared to Avastin (n=38). 
Since, however, incidence of liver-related TEAE was overall comparable between the treatment arms (MYL-
1402O: 16 patients with 41 events, Avastin: 15 patients with 27 events) and since the majority of events 
occurred during the combination therapy period (i.e. when patients were on background ChT), the overall 
conclusion of the applicant that those differences in elevated ALT and bilirubin are not considered to be of 
clinical relevance is considered acceptable. 
Regarding haematology, number of patients experienced shifts in performed tests, however, most of them 
were not serious and similar across treatment arms. There were reported CTCAE grade shifts to Grade 3-4 for 
parameters including haemoglobin, white blood cell counts, neutrophil and platelet count, however, with 
similar incidence in both arms. The presented data did not indicate any new safety patterns related to MYL-
1402O. 
No clinically relevant differences between treatment arms were observed for serum chemistry parameters. 
The observed shifts with increase of 1-2 grades or to higher Grade 3-4 were comparable between treatment 
arms. The clinically significant chemistry abnormalities reported as TEAEs consisted of anaemia, 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 106/125 
 
 
 
 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, blood creatinine increased, hyperkalaemia, 
hyponatremia, hypokalaemia. Majority of these events were of Grade 1-2 and incidences were in overall 
comparable between treatment arms.   
The clinically significant vital signs reported as TEAEs included PTs (in >1% of patients) hypertension, 
decreased weight and pyrexia which were mainly of CTCAE Grade 1-2. The incidence of observed PTs was 
comparable between arms except for PT ‘Decrease of weight’, which was more pronounced in the MYL-1402O 
arm (22 patients [6.6%] vs 7 patients [2.1%]). Notwithstanding this evidence, the treatment-related 
decrease of weight was shown in few patients only.  
In addition, a performed analysis of few reported TEAEs related to laboratory and vital signs abnormalities 
leading to discontinuation of treatment did not show any specific patterns. Overall, the collected results of 
haematology and serum chemistry parameters and vital signs did not reveal any clinically significant 
differences between treatments. Thus, the safety profile related to laboratory findings is concluded as 
comparable to Avastin without observation of any new safety risks. 
Safety in special populations 
No specific safety studies in special populations have been conducted. This is acceptable for a biosimilar 
application. 
No cases of pregnancies were reported in any of the studies.

Discontinuation due to AES 
Phase I PK study 
There were no AEs resulting in premature discontinuation from the study. 
Phase III NSCLC study 
Overall, 64/664 patients (9.6%) discontinued study treatment due to a total of 66 TEAEs. A slightly higher 
number of patients withdrew from treatment in the MYL-1402O group (36/335 patients, 10.7%; 38 events) 
compared to the EU-Avastin group (28/329 patients; 8.5%; 28 events).

EMA/176217/2021 
Page 107/125 
 
 
 
With regard to the number of patients who discontinued treatment due to drug related TEAEs, during Period 
1, there were 13 of such patients in both treatment arms (MYL-1402O: 3.9%; Avastin: 4.0%). In Period 2, 
there were 2 patients in the MYL-1402O group (1.0%) and 3 patients in the Avastin group (1.5%). 
Of note, for the MYL-1402O, there were 2 concerned events which are not considered “listed” for the known 
safety profile of bevacizumab, i.e. cardiorespiratory arrest and acute angle closure glaucoma. The patient 
experiencing cardiorespiratory arrest was 57 years old. Please refer to the Section on SAE and deaths for 
further details. Another patient who experienced angle closure glaucoma was 51 years old. This patient also 
received only one dose of study drug (660 mg), paclitaxel (229 mg) and carboplatin (612 mg). On Day 7, she 
was diagnosed with conjunctivitis (grade 2) and on Day 9 she experienced blurring of vision of the left eye, 
redness and pain in both eyes. The eye examination showed acute angle closure glaucoma with conjunctivitis 
(grade 3) and CT scan showed brain lesions, therefore, the patient was discontinued from the study. In view 
of the provided information, no impact on safety of MYL-1402O and related conclusions on safety profile can 
be detected. 
Supportive Phase III mCRC study 
TEAEs resulted in permanent discontinuation in 7 (10.29%) patients in the Bmab-100 and 2 (2.99%) patients 
in the Avastin arm. Out of these, 1 (1.47%) patient in the Bmab-100 arm and both patients in the Avastin 
arm had study drug-related TEAEs.

Post marketing experience 
The bevacizumab biosimilar MYL-1402O has not been approved or marketed yet in any country worldwide. 
However, Bmab-100, which is an “earlier version” of MYL-402O, received marketing authorisation approval in 
India in 2017 and is currently marketed in four non-European countries.  
From these post approval safety data, no new safety signals were detected so far.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant has provided safety data from a pivotal single-dose PK study in healthy male volunteers (study 
MYL-1402O-1002) and from a Phase III efficacy and safety study in male and female nsNSCLC patients (MYL-
1402O-3001). In addition, supportive safety data from a Phase III study in male and female mCRC patients 
(BM100-CC-03-I-01) have been submitted. This study was conducted with Bmab-100, an early development 
version of MYL-1402O. Here, the same drug product formulation was used as for MYL-1402O. 
It is stated by the applicant that during the manufacturing of the development batches of MYL-1402O, one 
formulation buffer component was changed. Instead of sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, sodium 
dihydrogen phosphate dehydrate was erroneously used. Since the manufacturing process was based on 
monohydrate, the buffer quantity was not adjusted for dihydrate (i.e. molecular weight of 137.8 was used

instead of 156). This inadvertent change resulted in small differences with regard to pH and osmolality. It 
was outlined by the applicant that the product quality with dihydrate buffer in terms of stability or other key 
product attributes were not impacted. 
According to the applicant, the formulation used in the completed as well as in the ongoing clinical studies 
(including the supportive study conducted with Bmab-100 in India by Biocon) contained sodium dihydrogen 
phosphate dihydrate. Also, the commercialised product in India contained the dihydrate salt. Since the 
product intended to be marketed in the EU is also based on the dihydrate salt, the data submitted are 
considered relevant for the evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of MYL-1402O.  
Study MYL-1402O-1002 and study BM100-CC-03-I-01 have been completed. For the pivotal Phase III study 
MYL-1402O-3001, data from Period 1 (up to 18 weeks) were the basis for initial assessment. In addition, 
during the procedure the final CSR including Week 42 data has been submitted.  
It was noted that the final CSR will include only Week 42 data. This in contrast to the EMA SA received by the 
applicant in October 2014, where the applicant stated that 1-year data would be generated in the pivotal 
phase III study, which was supported by the CHMP. The applicant provided justification on the deviation in 
the context of safety follow-up period for which the data is submitted (42 weeks instead of 1-year data). This 
is based on the amendment to the study protocol (from version 1.0 to version 2.0). Moreover, the applicant 
presented data available beyond Week 42 for the patients who entered extended treatment period (i.e. 86 
patients from the MYL-1402O group and 84 patients from the Avastin group). This is acceptable in this 
instance, since the pivotal Phase III study was conducted in an end-stage oncology indication in patients with 
a rather poor prognosis. Hence, a relevant “drop-out” of patients would have been expected over a period of 
1 year. 
Furthermore, 42-week data are considered acceptable against the background that immunogenicity is not so 
much a topic for bevacizumab and its biosimilars. 
The clinical studies were designed to rule out clinically relevant differences in safety between the biosimilar 
and the reference product and to confirm biosimilarity. The overall approach for the assessment of safety 
profile is considered acceptable, as it allows to capture relevant safety findings. 
Exposure data: 
In the pivotal PK study, the safety population consisted of 111 healthy male subjects aged 18 to 55 years 
who were randomised to one of three treatment arms and exposed to a single dose of 1 mg/kg bevacizumab 
iv (MYL-1402O: 37 subjects; EU-Avastin: 37 subjects; US-Avastin: 37 subjects). In the pivotal Phase III 
study in nsNSCLC patients, the safety population consisted of all NSCLC patients who received bevacizumab 
(either MYL-1402O or EU-Avastin) at a dose of 15 mg/kg iv at least once. Hence, a total of 663 out of the 
671 randomised patients were included in the safety set (MYL-1402O group: 335 patients [99.4%]; EU-
Avastin group: 329 patients [98.5%]). In the supportive mCRC study, the safety set consisted of all subjects 
who had received at least 1 dose of bevacizumab at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg iv (n= 135; Bmab-100: 68 patients, 
Avastin 67 patients). The overall safety population is considered sufficiently large to detect relevant safety 
signals in this comparability exercise. 
In the pivotal efficacy study MYL-1402O-3001, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an iv 
dose of 15 mg/kg of MYL-1402O or EU-Avastin plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (every three weeks) for up to 6 
cycles (induction treatment phase/ Period 1). Patients who responded to treatment continued with 
bevacizumab Q3W as monotherapy in the maintenance treatment phase (Period 2) until progression of

disease (PD) or discontinuation of interventional therapy (for any reason), or withdrawal of consent, 
whichever occurred first.  
Due to the heterogeneity of the study populations and the different treatment doses/ schemes used in the 
clinical studies, no pooled safety analysis was applicable. This is considered adequate. 
For the pivotal NSCLC study, based on the full Week 42 data set, the mean duration of exposure to 
bevacizumab was comparable between MYL-1402O (15.13 weeks) and EU-Avastin (14.65 weeks), as well as 
the mean number of doses (8.7 for both treatment arms) and the mean cumulative doses (MYL-1402O 131.0 
mg/kg versus EU-Avastin 131.8 mg/kg). In both study periods, a comparable number of cycles was overall 
administered across all patients in both treatment arms, with a slightly lower number of cycles administered 
in Period 2 for Avastin (n=1242) than for MYL-1402O (n=1278). 
With regard to chemotherapy, the mean duration of exposure as well as the mean number of doses received 
and the mean cumulative doses were comparable for both carboplatin and paclitaxel between both treatment 
arms.  
There was a higher number of patients with dose delays, especially with a delay of 8 or more days, observed 
in the MYL-1402O arm (n= 90 compared to n= 77 in the EU-Avastin arm). The applicant states that 
treatment delays ≤6 weeks were permitted as per protocol in case of documented toxicity related to 
bevacizumab or ChT. If ChT was withheld due to toxicity, the bevacizumab dose was also put on hold. 
However, the reasons for dose delays were not recorded systematically in the CRF. 
At Week 18, 217 (64.4%) patients in the MYL-1402O arm and 225 (67.4%) in the Avastin arm had their 
treatment ongoing. 118 patients in the MYL-1402O arm and 104 patients in the Avastin arm had discontinued 
treatment. The main reasons for discontinuation were disease progression, AEs or withdrawal in both groups.  
Adverse events: 
In the Phase I PK study, the proportion of subjects who experienced a TEAE was higher in the MYL-1402O 
arm (89%) as compared to the EU-Avastin (78%) and US-Avastin group (76%) arms. All of the TEAEs were 
however, Grade 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) in severity. No TEAES of Grade 3 (severe), 4 (life threatening) or 5 
(death) in severity and no discontinuations due to TEAEs or other safety issues occurred during the study in 
any of the groups. No systemic hypersensitivity or infusion reactions were reported in this study. 
The most frequently affected SOCs among the treatment groups were Gastrointestinal disorders and Nervous 
System disorders. There were differences in the incidence of TEAEs by PT between the treatment arms for 
catheter site erythema, pain in extremity, nasopharyngitis and hematoma (blood sampling arm). Notably, 
there were no PTs with at least a 10% absolute difference between TEAEs in both the EU- or US-Avastin 
groups vs the MYL-1402O group. The differences in incidence rates between treatment groups are thus not 
considered of clinical relevance. 
The most frequently reported TEAE by PT was headache in all treatment arms (MYL-1402O 19% [7/37 
subjects], US-Avastin 16% [6/37], EU-Avastin 24% [9/37]). This is consistent with the SmPC of Avastin, 
where headache is listed among the most frequently observed AE.  
The number of subjects experiencing TEAEs related to IP was overall comparable between the three 
treatment arms (MYL-1402O n=17, EU-Avastin n= 19, US-Avastin n=12).  
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021

In the Phase III NSCLC study, the majority of patients (91.1%) experienced at least one TEAE (91.3% in the 
MYL-1402O arm; 90.9% in the EU-Avastin group), most of the TEAEs being grade 1 and grade 2 in severity 
in both treatment groups. The number of TEAEs reported is, however, numerically higher in the MYL-1402O 
group (1918 TEAEs), compared to the EU-Avastin group (1761 TEAEs). 
In general, across both treatment arm, the incidences, types and severities of TEAEs seem similar and the 
distribution is in line with the safety profile for bevacizumab (SmPC Avastin). No new safety signals were 
identified.  
The overall number of patients experiencing TEAEs in the Phase III study is similar between both treatment 
groups (n= 306 [91.3%] in the MYL-1402O arm and 90.9% [299] in the EU-Avastin arm). The number of 
TEAEs reported is, however, higher in the MYL-1402O group (1918 TEAEs), compared to the EU-Avastin 
group (1761 TEAEs). The overall incidence of TEAEs was markedly lower in Period 2 than in Period 1 (57.1% 
vs 91.1%). It is acknowledged that this might be explained by the combination with ChT during Period 1, 
implying the occurrence of TEAE due to chemotherapy-associated toxicities. 
TEAEs related to study treatment were similar between the two treatment groups with regard to the 
proportion of patients who experienced these events (MYL-1402O n=120 [35.8%], Avastin n=115 [35.0%] 
and the number of events reported (377 in the MYL-1402O arm vs 382 in the Avastin arm). 
The number of patients with AESI by SMQ was comparable between the treatment arms (16.1% in the MYL-
1402O vs 20.1% in the EU-Avastin arm). The number of patients with Grade ≥3 AESI and serious AESI was 
also comparable between the treatment arms. Most of the reported AEIs were of Grade 1-2 only. Also the 
number of patients with serious AESIs by SMQ was comparable between the study arms; 17 (5.1%) in the 
MYL-1402O arm and 19 (5.8%) in the Avastin arm.  
Across both treatment groups, the incidences, types and severities of AESI seem comparable, and the 
distribution is in line with the safety profile for bevacizumab (SmPC Avastin).  The number of patients with 
AESI by SMQ was comparable between the treatment arms (16.1% in the MYL-1402O vs 20.1% in the EU-
Avastin arm) in Period 1. The number of patients with Grade ≥3 AESI and serious AESI was also comparable 
between the treatment arms. In Period 2, the incidence of AESI was lower compared to Period 1 (overall 
n=37 vs n=120 subjects with at least one event). Importantly, the AESI incidence was comparable between 
the treatment arms in the monotherapy period (n=21 [10.5%] in MYL-1402O vs n=16 [8.0%] in Avastin 
arm), also with regard to Grade ≥3 AESI (n=4 [2.0%] in the MYL-1402O vs n=5 [2.5%] in Avastin arm). 
Overall, up to Week 42, the incidence of Hypersensitivity AESI was low and comparable between treatment 
arms (reported in overall n=15 [2.3%] of patients, n=9 in MYL-1402O and n=6 in Avastin arm).  
Most of the Hypersensitivity AESI occurred during Period 1 (in n=13 patients [2.0%]). Here, 8 events were 
reported for the MYL-1402O arm and 5 events for the Avastin arm. Most events (n=6) were captured under 
the PT Dermatitis allergic. Only 1 PT of Hypersensitivity was reported in the MYL-1402O arm, and 1 PT of 
Anaphylactic reaction was reported in the Avastin arm; both were Grade ≥3. During Period 2, 
Hypersensitivity AESI occurred only in 2 patients (1 PT of Dermatitis allergic in the MYL-1402O arm and 1 PT 
of Swelling face in the Avastin arm). 
In the supportive Phase III study in mCRC patients, the overall incidence of TEAEs was slightly higher in the 
Avastin arm as compared to Bmab-100 arm. 54 (79.41%) patients in the Bmab-100 arm and 60 (89.55%) 
patients in the Avastin arm reported at least one TEAE. Most of the TEAEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 112/125 
 
 
 
Most of the TEAEs were considered not related to study drug and instead related to chemotherapy (XELOX) 
or underlying disease or progression. Six (8.82%) patients in the Bmab-100 arm and 12 (17.91%) patients in 
the Avastin arm had at least 1 TEAE related to Bmab-100/Avastin. 
The most commonly reported TEAE in the study was diarrhoea, reported in 11 (16.17%) patients (17 events, 
including one bacterial diarrhoea) in the Bmab-100 arm and 22 (32.84%) patients (35 events) in the Avastin 
arm. 
Overall, across both treatment groups, the incidences, types and severities of TEAE are considered 
comparable and thus supportive for the MYL-1402O MAA. 
Serious adverse events and deaths:  
There were no serious AEs or deaths reported in the Phase I PK study. 
The incidences and types of the SAEs reported in the Phase III NSCLC study were in line with the known 
safety profile of bevacizumab, generally comparable between the groups and with no clinically meaningful 
differences noticed. The incidence of SAE was similar between treatment arms, 59 (17.6%) patients in MYL-
1402O arm and 55 (16.7%) in Avastin arm. Overall, 142 SAEs were reported, all of which were treatment-
emergent (i.e. serious TEAEs). However, SAE with fatal outcome were more frequent in the MYL-1402O arm 
(n=22) compared to the Avastin arm (n=13). Most of the SAE (82 events) recovered or resolved – 40 in the 
MYL-1402O arm and 42 in the Avastin arm. The majority of those SAE resolved without any action taken. 
With regard to treatment-related SAEs, there was a higher number of patients in the Avastin arm (n=22) 
than in the MYL-1402O arm (n=17) during Period 1 reporting a higher number of treatment-related SAEs (30 
vs 21 events). The most frequently reported treatment-related SAEs by PT were pulmonary embolism (n=4 
in each treatment arm), thrombocytopenia (n=3 in the Avastin arm, n=1 for MYL-1402O), and febrile 
neutropenia (n=3 in the Avastin arm). 
In Period 2 of the study, the number of patients experiencing treatment-related SAE was similar between the 
treatment groups (n=2 patients per treatment arm). Furthermore, the incidence of related SAE was overall 
low and similar (n=2 events per group). Here, the following events (by PT) were reported: coronary artery 
disease, myocardial infarction, pulmonary haemorrhage, and hypertension. 
Overall, there were 183 deaths reported during the study, with 101 deaths in the MYL-1402O arm and 82 
deaths in the Avastin arm. 
Importantly, the imbalance with regard to the number of deaths remained rather stable between the 
treatment arms throughout the study. The numerical difference in deaths between the treatment arms 
increased slightly from n=16 (Week 18 CSR, with 50 versus 34 deaths for the MYL-1402O arm vs Avastin) to 
n=19 (Week 42 CSR, with 101 versus 82 deaths for MYL-1402O vs Avastin). 
When focusing on the imbalance in the number of deaths, it was noted that death due to disease progression 
was similar between the treatment arms - 57 (17.0%) in the MYL-1402O arm vs 56 (17.0%) in the Avastin 
arm. The observed imbalance in deaths between the treatment arms could be attributed mainly to Non-
Cancer deaths (i.e. deaths due to TEAE and due to Unknown reasons). 
Overall, more deaths occurred during the Induction phase (combination with ChT) than during the 
Maintenance phase (bevacizumab monotherapy). Here, the additional toxicity by the chemotherapy 
components might have played a role.

25 patients in the MYL-1402O arm compared to 14 patients in the Avastin arm experienced TEAE leading to 
death. However, most of these TEAE leading to death were not classified as treatment related. 
Treatment-related TEAEs leading to death were reported in 8 (2.4%) patients in the MYL-1402O arm and in 5 
(1.5%) patients in the Avastin arm, respectively. These drug-related TEAE that occurred in the MYL-1402O 
group were the following: pulmonary embolism (in 2 patients), pulmonary haemorrhage (in 2 patients), 
cardiorespiratory arrest, acute coronary syndrome, gastric perforation and cerebrovascular accident. With the 
exception of cardiorespiratory arrest and acute coronary syndrome, the reported events are listed in the 
product information for Avastin.  
The not IMP-related deaths were considered possibly related to underlying disease, chemotherapy, cardiac 
medical history, comorbidities and concurrent illnesses. 
The incidence of AESI leading to death was similar in both the arms, 11 (3.3%) patients in the MYL-1402O 
arm and 8 (2.4%) patients in Avastin arm. 
Unknown reasons leading to death were reported in 16 patients (4.8%) in the MYL-1402O arm and in 11 
patients (3.3%) in the Avastin arm. 11 deaths due to unknown reason occurred during the treatment period. 
Causes of death, upon further clinical evaluation, were likely due to underlying disease, comorbidities, clinical 
progression or concurrent chemotherapy. Another 16 deaths due to unknown reason were reported by phone 
during Follow-Up.   
To note, a comparatively higher incidence of deaths was observed during the induction period especially 
within the first 30 days of IMP administration (n=13 for MYL-1402O vs n=3 for Avastin). 
In those patients who died during 30 days of the first IMP dose in the MYL-1402O arm, various baseline and 
disease related factors increasing the risk of death during anti-cancer treatments were observed, i.e. age 
≥65 years, ECOG 1, smoking, advanced substage M1c and significant comorbid conditions.  
It is acknowledged that this early difference in death numbers between the treatment arms cannot be 
conclusively attributed to a lack of IMP efficacy, since a steady state concentration for bevacizumab is 
reported to be reached after approx. 100 days in the NSCLC population. In addition, the mean Cmax after the 
first treatment cycle was similar between the treatment arms, thus IMP-related toxicity is considered 
unlikely.  
Overall, it is concluded by the applicant that a “carry-over” effect of the higher number of early deaths may, 
at least in part, be responsible for the overall imbalance in deaths between the treatment arms. Furthermore, 
the types of deaths were rather variable including treatment-related and non-treatment-related deaths, with 
no clear pattern or clustering by any SOC/PT in the TEAE leading to death in the MYL-1402O arm. This is 
acknowledged. 
The different numbers of death in the treatment groups at early time points lead to different follow-up times 
for adverse events, and probably to bias in incidence proportions of adverse events. The provided cumulative 
incidence functions (Aalen-Johansen estimator) show that the bias due to early deaths that lead to an 
underestimation of adverse event rates were negligible. 
In the supportive Phase III study in mCRC patients, 42 SAEs were reported in 31 patients, of which 5 were 
related to the study drug. 16 (23.53%) patients in the Bmab-100 arm reported 18 treatment-emergent SAEs, 
and 15 (22.39%) patients in the Avastin arm reported 24 treatment-emergent SAEs. The SAEs constituted 
events expected from the known safety profile of Avastin. Most were assessed to be related to other 
Assessment report

Page 114/125 
 
 
 
confounding factors like XELOX chemotherapy and underlying disease. Across both treatment groups, the 
incidences and types of SAES are considered comparable and thus supportive for the MYL-1402O MAA. 
Thirteen deaths were reported in the mCRC study (Bmab-100 arm: 5 and Avastin arm: 8). Of these, 2 deaths 
were attributed to TEAEs related to study drug (1 event in each arm). 
Laboratory findings:  
According to the applicant, there was no evidence of clinically relevant differences in any laboratory 
parameter between the three treatment groups over time in the Phase I study, between the two treatment 
arms in the Phase III nsNSCLC study, and between the three treatment arms in the supportive Phase III 
mCRC study. 
In the pivotal Phase III NSCLC study, the collected results of haematology and serum chemistry parameters 
and vital signs did not reveal any clinically significant differences between treatments. Thus, the safety profile 
related to laboratory findings is concluded comparable to Avastin without observation of any new safety risks. 
Immunogenicity:  
Refer to the discussion on immunogenicity.  
Study discontinuation due to AEs:  
In the Phase I PK study in healthy volunteers, no AE resulted in premature discontinuation from the study. 
In the Phase III NSCLC trial, a slightly higher number of patients withdrew from treatment in the MYL-1402O 
group (36/335 patients, 10.7%; 38 events) compared to the EU-Avastin group (28/329 patients; 8.5%; 28 
events). With regard to the number of patients who discontinued treatment due to drug related TEAEs, 
during Period 1, there were 13 of such patients in both treatment arms (MYL-1402O: 3.9%; Avastin: 4.0%). 
In Period 2, there were 2 patients in the MYL-1402O group (1.0%) and 3 patients in the Avastin group 
(1.5%). 
In the supportive Phase III study in mCRC patients, TEAEs resulted in permanent discontinuation in 7 
(10.29%) patients in the Bmab-100 and 2 (2.99%) patients in the Avastin arm. Out of these, 1 (1.47%) 
patient in the Bmab-100 arm and both patients in the Avastin arm had study drug-related TEAEs. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The provided Week 42 safety and immunogenicity data support the overall conclusion that a comparable 
safety profile has been demonstrated between MYL-1402O and Avastin. Furthermore, no new safety signals 
have been identified.  
The provision of 42-week data (instead of 1 -ear data, as requested by ICH E1) is considered acceptable in 
this instance, since the pivotal Phase III study was conducted in an end-stage oncology indication in patients 
with a rather poor prognosis. Hence, a relevant “drop-out” of patients would have been expected over a 
period of 1 year. 
Moreover, the applicant presented data available beyond Week 42 for the patients who entered extended 
treatment period (i.e. 86 patients from the MYL-1402O group and 84 patients from the Avastin group). 
Furthermore, 42-week data are considered acceptable against the background that immunogenicity is not so 
much a topic for bevacizumab and its biosimilars.

With regard to the observed imbalance in death/ survival rates between the treatment arms, a review of BL 
characteristics showed higher incidence of vascular and cardiac disorders in the MYL-1402O arm, as well as a 
higher proportion of M1c substage patients. Types of deaths were rather variable with no clear pattern or 
clustering by any SOC/PT. Even though the present underlying conditions make an assessment of causal 
association more difficult, following a review on a case by case basis, no trend or significant safety-related 
concern in view of the study drug could be identified. 
In addition, it is noted that the chosen NSCLC patient population may not be ideal for demonstration of 
clinical comparability, due to the fact that the course of disease may vary from slowly progressive to 
aggressive profile in patients having several comorbidities, increasing the risk of fatal events. 
Taken together, the numerical difference in deaths between study arms can be explained by several 
confounding factors and is not considered a difference in biosimilarity.

received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. 
•  Abevmy, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in patients 
who cannot receive platinum therapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, 
recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix). 
Summary of analytical similarity 
For the biosimilarity exercise, the quality attributes of the reference medicinal product in terms of its 
physicochemical and functional properties were characterised. The identified quality attributes were ranked 
according to (a) their risk to potentially impact activity, PK/PD, safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity, and (b) 
the degree of uncertainty surrounding a certain quality attribute. 
The number of batches of EU-Approved Avastin and US-Licensed Avastin as well as of Abevmy were 
considered adequate for the analytical similarity assessment. 
To support the known mechanism of action, binding to VEGF and inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed 
by functional and binding assays in the scope of the biosimilarity exercise. Assays include binding to VEGF

(VEGF-165 and VEGF-121 and VEGF-189), inhibition of VEGF (VEGF-165, VEGF-121 and VEGF-189) induced 
proliferation of endothelial cells (HUVECs), and inhibition of VEGF-165 induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. 
In addition to Fab-associated antigen binding, MYL1402O binding to Fc receptors and complement factor C1q 
were evaluated in the scope of the biosimilarity exercise using in vitro assays. C1q binding was assessed via 
ELISA and binding kinetics with FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIIb and FcRn were assessed via 
surface plasmon resonance. Furthermore, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement 
dependent cytotoxicity assays were included as part of the comparability exercise - even though 
bevacizumab is not known to act through either of these mechanisms. 
Furthermore, primary structure, higher order structure, protein concentration, high and low molecular weight 
impurities, charge heterogeneity, glycosylation and other amino acid modifications were assessed using a 
variety of methods.  
Overall, the applicant followed relevant guidelines and performed an extensive biosimilarity exercise using 
sensitive orthogonal state-of-the-art analytical methods. All relevant quality attributes were addressed. 
Summary of non-clinical data 
For global development, the toxicological profile of the proposed biosimilar candidate was determined in 
several in vivo acute and repeat-dose studies in mice, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. Two of the studies 
are comparative in nature. In a repeat-dose study in mice (Study 9335), Bmab-100 (an older version of MYL-
1402O) was compared to US-Avastin. In a repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys, MYL-1402O and US-
Avastin were compared. Overall, studies 9335 and TOX-070-002 seem to demonstrate biosimilarity of MYL-
1402O and Avastin. The results of the studies are regarded supportive and do not add further value for the 
demonstration of biosimilarity. 
Summary of clinical data 
The clinical development programme consists of two studies: 
- 
a 3-arm pivotal Phase I PK study (MYL-1402O-1002), comparing MYL-1402O to EU-sourced and 
US-sourced Avastin in 111 healthy male subjects, investigating PK, safety and immunogenicity, and  
- 
a global multi-centre parallel group Phase III efficacy/safety study (MYL-1402O-3001) in 671 
patients with Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC to comparatively investigate efficacy, safety, 
immunogenicity and PK of MYL-1402O compared to EU-Avastin. 
In addition, supportive data were submitted from a comparative PK, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity 
study (BM100-CC-03-I-01) conducted by Mylan’s partner Biocon in 135 mCRC patients in India with Bmab-
100, an early development version of MYL-1402O. 
In general, the applicant followed EMA guidelines and former CHMP advice. However, it is noted that - in 
contrast to the EMA SA received by the applicant in October 2014, where it was agreed that 1-year data 
would be generated in the pivotal phase III study - the final CSR will include only Week 42 data. 
Overall, the data from the clinical studies that have been submitted with the MAA support biosimilarity of 
MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin. 
The pharmacokinetics of MYL-1402O are considered similar to that of EU-Avastin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 119/125 
 
 
 
In the pivotal Phase III study MYL-1402O-3001 in NSCLC patients, equivalence between MYL-1402O and EU-
Avastin was demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint, best ORR within 18 weeks, assessed by 
independent review in the ITT population. This was supported by sensitivity analyses for the primary EP in 
the PP population, which is the population of interest for a biosimilar.  
An imbalance in death rates was observed between treatment arms (n=101 [30.1%] vs n=82 [24.9%]), 
disfavoring MYL-1402O. A thorough review of BL characteristics showed higher incidence of vascular and 
cardiac disorders in the MYL-1402O arm, as well as a higher proportion of M1c substage patients. Types of 
deaths were rather variable with no clear pattern or clustering by any SOC/PT. 
The applicant has provided analyses identifying factors such as imbalances in post-treatment anticancer 
therapies as well as in deaths occurring within 30 days of first IMP dose, which may have contributed to this 
imbalance (“carry-over” effect of higher number of early deaths). 
In addition, it is noted that the chosen NSCLC patient population may not be ideal for demonstration of 
clinical comparability, due to the fact that the course of disease may vary from slowly progressive to 
aggressive profile in patients having several comorbidities, increasing the risk of fatal events.  
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
In summary, the presented analytical data show similarity of the proposed biosimilar MYL-1402O and the 
reference medicinal product EU-Avastin. Quality attributes related to the mechanism of action of 
bevacizumab were highly similar. The analytical differences observed for several quality attributes have been 
appropriately addressed by the applicant and justified with regard to their potential impact on clinical 
performance of the product. 
Clinical 
Pharmacokinetics: 
The pharmacokinetics of MYL-1402O are considered similar to that of EU-Avastin. 
Efficacy:  
In the pivotal comparative efficacy study MYL-1402O-3001 in Stage IV nsNSCLC patients, equivalence 
between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin was demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint, best ORR within 18 
weeks, assessed by independent review both in the ITT and in the PP population. The difference in best ORR 
within 18 wks was -1.6 (-9.0, 5.9) for the ITT population and -2.4 95% CI of (-10.2, 5.3) for the PP set; the 
two-sided 95% CI was entirely within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [-12.5%, 12.5%]. This was 
supported by sensitivity analyses for the primary EP, e.g. investigator-assessed ORR in the ITT population 
(ORR difference of -2.2, with a 95% CI of -9.7, 5.3) - the results were consistent with the primary analysis. 
In addition, post-hoc sensitivity analyses have been provided for ORR at week 18, which is considered a more 
sensitive endpoint for a biosimilarity exercise than the BOR at any time point during the 18-week induction 
period. ORR rates at week 18 were similar between the treatment arms, both in the ITT and PP set, based on 
independent review as well as on investigator assessment. Overall, the presented additional ORR analyses at 
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 120/125 
 
 
 
week 18 indicate similar efficacy between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin and do thus support the results from 
the primary analysis. 
Safety:  
Based on Week 42 safety and immunogenicity data from the pivotal comparative efficacy and safety study in 
NSCLC patients, on the data of the Phase I PK study in healthy volunteers as well as of the supportive Phase 
III mCRC study conducted by Biocon, the incidences, types and severities of TEAEs, AESI and SAE seem 
comparable between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin and are in line with the safety profile for bevacizumab 
(SmPC Avastin). No new safety signals have been identified so far. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
No uncertainties considering the biosimilarity remain as outlined below. 
Quality 
The similarity assessment of MYL-1402O and the EU reference medicinal product showed highly similar 
biological activity of both the Fab and Fc-based functionality. Minor differences in the levels of aggregates, 
fragments, charged species and the glycosylation pattern were observed for MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin. 
However, it was concluded that these differences have no impact on PK, activity, safety and immunogenicity. 
From a quality perspective, MYL-1402O is regarded similar to its reference medicinal product EU-Avastin. 
Clinical 
Efficacy: 
Phase III NSCLC study:  
Overall, equivalence between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin was convincingly demonstrated for the primary 
efficacy endpoint, best ORR within 18 weeks. 
Safety: 
Phase III NSCLC study:  
Safety and immunogenicity data support the conclusion that a comparable safety profile has been 
demonstrated between MYL-1402O and Avastin. Furthermore, no new safety signals have been identified. 
42-week data have been submitted, instead of 1-year data, as advised by ICH E1 and the CHMP GL on 
similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substances: non-
clinical and clinical issues. In this instance, this is considered acceptable, since the pivotal Phase III study 
was conducted in an end-stage oncology indication in patients with a rather poor prognosis. Hence, a 
relevant “drop-out” of patients would have been expected over a period of 1 year. 
Moreover, the applicant presented data available beyond Week 42 for the patients who entered extended 
treatment period (i.e. 86 patients from the MYL-1402O group and 84 patients from the Avastin group). 
Furthermore, 42-week data are considered acceptable against the background that immunogenicity is not so 
much a topic for bevacizumab and its biosimilars.

3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Overall, the design of the analytical similarity exercise is considered adequate. The results of the analytical 
similarity exercise between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin demonstrate similarity. Analytical differences 
observed between MYL-1402O and the reference product have been adequately justified with regard to their 
potential impact on clinical efficacy and safety. From an analytical perspective, MYL-1402O is regarded 
similar to its reference medicinal product. 
The pharmacokinetics of MYL-1402O are considered similar to that of EU-Avastin. 
In the pivotal comparative efficacy study MYL-1402O-3001 in Stage IV nsNSCLC patients, equivalence 
between MYL-1402O and EU-Avastin was demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint, best ORR within 18 
weeks, assessed by independent review in the ITT population. This was supported by sensitivity analyses for 
the primary EP in the PP population, which is the population of interest for a biosimilar. ORR is considered 
adequate as primary endpoint, and ORR analysis at Week 18 supported equivalence between MYL-1402O and 
the reference product. 
42-week data have been submitted, instead of 1-year data, as advised by ICH E1 and the CHMP GL on 
similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substances: non-
clinical and clinical issues. In this instance, this is considered acceptable, since the pivotal Phase III study 
was conducted in an end-stage oncology indication in patients with a rather poor prognosis. Hence, a 
relevant “drop-out” of patients would have been expected over a period of 1 year. 
Moreover, the applicant presented data available beyond Week 42 for the patients who entered extended 
treatment period (i.e. 86 patients from the MYL-1402O group and 84 patients from the Avastin group). 
Furthermore, 42-week data are considered acceptable against the background that immunogenicity is not so 
much a topic for bevacizumab and its biosimilars. 
Overall, safety and immunogenicity data support the conclusion that a comparable safety profile has been 
demonstrated between MYL-1402O and Avastin. Furthermore, no new safety signals have been identified.  
With regard to the observed imbalance in death/ survival rates between the treatment arms, a review of BL 
characteristics showed higher incidence of vascular and cardiac disorders in the MYL-1402O arm, as well as a 
higher proportion of M1c substage patients. Types of deaths were rather variable with no clear pattern or 
clustering by any SOC/PT. 
Even though the present underlying conditions make an assessment of causal association more difficult, 
following a review on a case by case basis, no trend or significant safety-related concern in view of the study 
drug could be identified. 
In addition, it is noted that the chosen NSCLC patient population may not be ideal for demonstration of 
clinical comparability, due to the fact that the course of disease may vary from slowly progressive to 
aggressive profile in patients having several comorbidities, increasing the risk of fatal events. 
Taken together, the numerical difference in deaths between study arms might be explained by several 
confounding factors and is not considered a difference in biosimilarity. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The primary mechanism of action of bevacizumab is the inhibition of tumour vessel growth by blocking VEGF. 
The mode of action of bevacizumab is considered the same across all approved cancer indications.  
Assessment report  
EMA/176217/2021 
Page 122/125 
 
 
 
Extrapolation to all approved indications authorised for the bevacizumab reference product Avastin is 
considered acceptable, provided that similarity of MYL-1402O/ Abevmy to EU-Avastin has been convincingly 
demonstrated.  
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Abevmy (also referred to as MYL-1402O) is considered biosimilar 
to Avastin. Therefore, a benefit/risk balance is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Abevmy is not similar to Zejula within the meaning of Article 3 
of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Abevmy is favourable in the following indication: 
Abevmy in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult patients 
with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. 
Abevmy in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
breast cancer. For further information as to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, please 
refer to section 5.1. 
Abevmy in combination with capecitabine is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
breast cancer in whom treatment with other chemotherapy options including taxanes or anthracyclines is not 
considered appropriate. Patients who have received taxane and anthracycline-containing regimens in the 
adjuvant setting within the last 12 months should be excluded from treatment with Abevmy in combination 
with capecitabine. For further information as to HER2 status, please refer to section 5.1. 
Abevmy, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients 
with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly 
squamous cell histology. 
Abevmy, in combination with erlotinib, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable 
advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with Epidermal Growth Factor 
Receptor (EGFR) activating mutations (see section 5.1). 
Abevmy in combination with interferon alfa-2a is indicated for first line treatment of adult patients with 
advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer.

VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents. 
Abevmy in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens and who have not received 
prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents (see section 5.1). 
Abevmy, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in patients 
who cannot receive platinum therapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with persistent,

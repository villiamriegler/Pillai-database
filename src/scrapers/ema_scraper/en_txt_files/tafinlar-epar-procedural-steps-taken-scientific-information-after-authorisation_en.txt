a reduction in the incidence of grade 3/4 pyrexia AEs, 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC in 
order to update the recommendations for the 
management of pyrexia and to reflect the results of 
cross comparison clinical studies that used either the 
existing or updated pyrexia management guidance; 
the Package Leaflets are updated accordingly. In 
addition, the WSA took the opportunity to update the 
list of local representatives and to include minor 
editorial changes in the Package Leaflets. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed

hospitalizations due to serious pyrexia, and pyrexia with 
complications. Based on this comparison, it is 
recommended that therapy should be interrupted 
(trametinib when used as monotherapy, and both 
trametinib and dabrafenib when used in combination; 
dabrafenib when used as monotherapy, and both 
dabrafenib and trametinib when used in combination) if a 
patient’s temperature is ≥38oC. In case of recurrence, 
therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of 
pyrexia. Treatment with anti-pyretics such as ibuprofen or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol should be initiated. The use of 
oral corticosteroids should be considered in those instances 
in which anti-pyretics are insufficient. Patients should be 
evaluated for signs and symptoms of infection and if 
necessary treated in line with local practice. Trametinib, 
dabrafenib or both trametinib and dabrafenib, when used in 
combination, should be restarted if the patient is symptom 
free for at least 24 hours either (1) at the same dose level, 
or (2) reduced by one dose level, if pyrexia is recurrent 
and/or was accompanied by other severe symptoms 
including dehydration, hypotension or renal failure.

with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level at baseline. 
From an OS analysis of study MEK116513 (COMBI-v) at 5

patients were enrolled into four cohorts. The primary 
endpoint of the study was intracranial response in Cohort A 
defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed 
intracranial response assessed by the investigator using 
modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST) version 1.1. This cohort included patients with 
BRAFV600E mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain 
metastases without prior local brain-directed therapy and 
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The intracranial 
response rate in 76 patients in cohort A was 59% (95% CI: 
47.3-70.4). Due to small sample size reflected by wide 
95% CIs, the results in cohorts B, C, and D should be 
interpreted with caution. The safety profile observed in the 
study appears to be consistent with the integrated safety 
profile of the combination.

An updated OS analysis (15 February 2016) for study 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
Update of section 5.1 of the Mekinist (trametinib) 
and Tafinlar (dabrafenib) SmPC to include the 3-
years overall survival (OS) results from study 
MEK115306 (COMBI-d), a phase III, randomised, 
double-blinded study comparing the combination of 
dabrafenib and trametinib to dabrafenib  and placebo 
in first-line therapy for subjects with unresectable or 
metastatic BRAF V600/K mutation-positive cutaneous 
melanoma. 
Update of section 5.1 of the Mekinist (trametinib) 
and Tafinlar (dabrafenib) SmPC to include the 3-
years overall survival (OS) results from study 
MEK116513 (COMBI-v), a phase III, open-label, 2 
arm, randomised study comparing dabrafenib and 
trametinib combination therapy with vemurafenib 
MEK115306 (COMBI-d) demonstrated an improvement in 
OS for the combination compared with dabrafenib 
monotherapy. The 3-year OS estimate for the combination 
arm was greater than for dabrafenib monotherapy (44% 
vs. 32%, respectively). The median OS for the combination 
arm was approximately 8 months longer than the median 
OS for dabrafenib monotherapy (26.7 months versus 18.7 
months). These data also demonstrated a reduction in the 
risk of death (HR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.96) which was 
consistent with the primary OS analysis. An updated OS 
analysis (15 July 2016) for study MEK116513 (COMBI-v) 
demonstrated improvement in OS for the combination 
compared with vemurafenib monotherapy. The 3-year OS 
estimate was 45% for combination therapy and 31% for 
vemurafenib. The median OS for the combination arm was 
approximately 8 months longer than the median OS for 
vemurafenib monotherapy (26.1 months versus 17.8 
months). These data also demonstrated a reduction in the 
risk of death (HR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.83) which was

2014N220059). The results of study 2015N235499 
demonstrated that dabrafenib is also a substrate of human 
BCRP in vitro. The results of study 2014N220059 
demonstrated that dabrafenib and its desmethyl metabolite 
were found to be inhibitors of organic cation transporter 2

study comparing dabrafenib to dacarbazine (DTIC) in 
previously untreated patients with BRAF mutation 
positive advanced (stage III) or metastatic (stage

superior efficacy of dabrafenib compared to DTIC. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
patients with BRAF mutation positive advanced (stage III) 
or metastatic (stage IV) melanoma to confirm the superior 
efficacy of dabrafenib compared to DTIC provided further 
information on the efficacy comparison between dabrafenib 
and DTIC. The final results from this study compared with 
the preliminary results available at time of the initial 
Marketing Authorisation application did not identify any 
significant difference between primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints (progression free survival and overall 
survival respectively) nor any clinically significant changes 
in the safety profile. Overall, the results presented in this 
application are consistent with previous reported data and 
did not warrant amendment to the product information.

The results of a drug-drug interaction study (200919) 
include the results of a drug-drug interaction 
between dabrafenib and rosuvastatin (an 
OATP1B1/1B3 substrate) and between dabrafenib 
and midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) based on study 
200919; this is a phase I open-label fixed sequence 
study to evaluate the effects of an OATP1B1/1B3 
substrate (rosuvastatin) and of a CYP3A4 substrate 
(midazolam) on the repeat dose pharmacokinetics of 
dabrafenib in subjects with BRAFV60 mutation 
positive tumours, in fulfillment of MEA 001. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
between dabrafenib and rosuvastatin showed that Cmax of 
rosuvastatin increased 2.6-fold whereas the area under the 
curve (AUC) was only minimally changed (7% increase). 
The increased Cmax of rosuvastatin is unlikely to have 
clinical relevance. Sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
for Tafinlar has been updated with this information.

effects of potent CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin) and of 
a pH elevating agent (rabeprazole) on the repeat 
dose pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib in subjects with 
BRAFV60 mutation positive tumours, to fulfil MEA 
005. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily resulted in a decrease 
in repeat dose dabrafenib Cmax (27%) and AUC (34%). No 
relevant change in AUC was noted for hydroxy-dabrafenib. 
There was an increase in AUC of 73% for carboxy 
dabrafenib and a decrease in AUC of 30% for desmethyl 
dabrafenib. Co administration of repeat doses of dabrafenib 
150 mg twice daily and the pH elevating agent rabeprazole 
40 mg once daily resulted in a 3% increase in AUC and a 
12% decrease in dabrafenib Cmax. These changes in 
dabrafenib AUC and Cmax are considered not clinically 
meaningful. Medicinal products that alter the pH of the 
upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g. proton pump 
inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists, antacids) are not 
expected to reduce the bioavailability of dabrafenib.

Update of section 5.3 with new data from a 26-week 
toxicology study in mice (G12071). In addition, the 
MAH revised the submission date for the final report 
for a drug-drug interaction study (MEA 006) and has 
updated the RMP accordingly. The MAH also took the 
opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required 
toxicology study. The toxicity findings were generally 
similar to what was previously observed in rats and dogs. 
However, the study showed hepatoxicity as a novel finding 
in mice. Focal arterial/perivascular inflammation in various 
tissues was observed in mice and an increased incidence of 
hepatic arterial degeneration and spontaneous 
cardiomyocyte degeneration with inflammation 
(spontaneous cardiomyopathy) was observed in rats (≥0.5 
and 0.6 times clinical exposure for rats and mice 
respectively). Hepatic effects, including hepatocellular 
necrosis and inflammation, were observed in mice (≥0.6 
times clinical exposure).

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been 
reported with Benlysta treatment for SLE. Physicians should 
be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that 
patients may not notice (e.g., cognitive, neurological or 
psychiatric symptoms or signs). Patients should be 
monitored for any of these new or worsening symptoms or 
signs, and if such symptoms/signs occur, referral to a 
neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML 
should be considered as clinically indicated. If PML is 
suspected, immunosuppressant therapy, including 
Benlysta, must be suspended until PML has been excluded.

Study BEL115467, listed as a category 3 in the RMP, was a 
Treatment Follow-Up from study BEL 
115467/HGS1006-C113 listed as a category 3 study 
in the RMP. This is a 52-week, global, multi-center, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study 
conducted to evaluate mortality and AESI in adults 
with active, autoantibody-positive SLE treated with 
belimumab plus standard therapy vs. placebo plus 
standard therapy. The RMP version 44 was approved.
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week 
study to evaluate mortality and adverse events of special 
interest (AESI) in adult patients with active, autoantibody-
positive SLE who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
belimumab (10 mg/kg IV) plus standard therapy (n=2002) 
or placebo plus standard therapy (n=2001). Following the 
52-week controlled treatment period (Year 1) (please refer 
to previous assessments as part of procedures 
EMEA/H/C/002015/II/0065 and 
EMEA/H/C/002015/II/0076), the study continued to follow 
up with each participant for a further 4 years (Year 2-5). 
The objective of this Year 2-5 post-treatment follow-up 
period was to assess mortality and new primary 
malignancy, including non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), 
in adult SLE participants who received either belimumab 
plus standard therapy or placebo plus standard of care 
Page 4/36
during the Year 1 treatment period of the study. The safety 
data presented no new safety concerns for the use of 
belimumab in adult patients with active, autoantibody 
positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy. RMP 
version 44 was updated due to the completion of study 
BEL115467 (BASE). Some further minor updates were also 
made (e.g. study 213928 (PASS Belimumab Pregnancy 
Exposure Study) is updated from planned to ongoing).

SmPC and PL
Section 5.1 of the SmPC is updated as follows: Among 
patients experiencing a severe flare, the median study day 
of the first severe flare was Day 150 in the Benlysta group 
and Day 113 in the placebo group. Severe flares were 
observed in 17.0% of the Benlysta group compared to 
35.0% of the placebo group over the 52 weeks of 
observation (observed treatment difference = 18.0%; 
hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.86). 
The updates are made in accordance with the definitions in 
the Reporting and Analysis Plan. The revised results show 
lower proportion of patients experiencing severe flares in 
both treatment groups than in the originally submitted 
results. The difference is small and has no impact on the 
interpretation of the efficacy results.
identification of an error in the clinical study report 
for study BEL114055 conducted in paediatric 
patients. The results for the other efficacy endpoint 
‘time to first severe flare over 52 weeks’ are 
corrected. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to update the list of local representatives in the

patients aged ≥65 years (63 patients for efficacy and 219 
for safety) is not sufficient to determine whether they 
respond differently to younger patients. Therefore, Benlysta

In conclusion, the study results showed that the frequency 
of infections in total, serious infections, pneumonia and 
tuberculosis were not reported more frequently for Benlysta 
than for placebo. Benlysta does not seem to confer an 
increased risk for infections per se but rather a worse 
outcome of in case a patient has acquired an infection. It 
was agreed to strengthen section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC 
to include information on the increased risk for fatal 
infections as follows. The PL has been updated accordingly.
Section 4.4: “In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of 
serious infections was similar across the Benlysta and 
placebo groups; however, fatal infections (e.g. pneumonia 
and sepsis) occurred more frequently in patients receiving 
Benlysta compared with placebo (see section 4.8). 
Pneumococcal vaccination should be considered before 
initiating Benlysta treatment. Benlysta should not be 
initiated in patients with active serious infections (including 
serious chronic infections). Physicians should exercise 
caution and carefully assess if the benefits are expected to 
outweigh the risks when considering the use of Benlysta in 
Page 12/36
patients with a history of recurrent infection. Physicians 
should advise patients to contact their health care provider 
if they develop symptoms of an infection.”
Section 4.8: “In a randomised, double-blind, 52-week, 
post-marketing safety study (BEL115467) which assessed 
mortality and specific adverse events in adults, serious 
infections occurred in 3.7% of patients receiving Benlysta 
(10 mg/kg intravenously) vs 4.1% of patients receiving 
placebo. However, fatal infections (e.g. pneumonia and 
sepsis) occurred in 0.45% (9/2002) of Benlysta-treated 
patients vs 0.15% (3/2001) of patients receiving placebo, 
while the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.50% 
(10/2002) vs 0.40% (8/2001), respectively. Most fatal 
infections were observed during the first 20 weeks of 
treatment with Benlysta.”

n/a
BEL116027 was Phase 3b, multi-centre, open-label, non-
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a 
multi-centre, open-label, non-randomized, efficacy 
and safety study to evaluate treatment holidays and 
rebound phenomenon after treatment with 
belimumab 10 mg/kg in subjects with low SLE 
randomized 52-week study to evaluate treatment holidays 
and rebound phenomenon in adult subjects with active SLE. 
Subjects were recruited into three study arms: 
•
a treatment holiday group – 6 months off 
treatment followed by 6 months re-treatment (TH)
disease activity. The RMP is updated to version 34 to 
•
a control group – continuous belimumab treatment 
reflect the study results.
(TC) 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority
•
a long-term discontinuation group (LTD) 
All subjects had received belimumab for at least 6 months. 
Subjects eligible for treatment holiday were to be clinically 
stable as defined as SELENA SLEDAI score ≤3, C3 and C4 
complement levels at or above the lower limit of normal 
and on a stable SLE treatment regimen. The study was 
non-randomised, i.e. the patients and investigators were 
free to choose between treatment holiday or continuous 
treatment. Primary efficacy endpoint was time to any SLE 
Flare as defined as SELENA SLEDAI SLE Flare Index (SFI).
The proportion of subjects experiencing an SFI flare was 
balanced between the groups (4/12 subjects, 33% in the 
TH group during the TH phase) and TC group (9/29 
subjects, 31%). It should be noted that the follow-up time 
of the TH phase was only 24 weeks as compared to the 
treatment control group which was 52 weeks. According to 
a Kaplan-Meier curve, subjects in the TH group were at 
higher risk for experiencing flares than the TC group.
The primary efficacy analysis, the median time to flare, 
could not be calculated in the TH or TC groups because 
fewer than half of the patients flared in these groups. The 
Page 14/36
median time to flare among subjects that flared was 
substantially shorter in the TH group than in the TC group. 
In summary, treatment holiday was associated with a 
higher risk for flare and a shorter time to flare than 
compared to continuous treatment. No subjects in either 
group developed anti-drug antibodies. However, due to 
nature of the study (small sample size, non-randomised, 
only descriptive statistics) no firm conclusion can be made. 
No increased risk for immunogenicity was observed in this 
limited study. Therefore, no update to the SmPC was 
warranted by these data.

SmPC
Benlysta was administered intravenously to black patients 
mg and 400mg powder for concentrate for solution 
for infusion based on final results from study 
BEL115471/ HGS1006-C1112 listed as a category 3 
study in the RMP; this is a Phase 3/4, multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-
week study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
belimumab in African-American/Black subjects with 
systemic lupus erythematosus. Section 5.1 of the 
SmPC for Benlsyta 200 mg solution for injection was 
updated to cross refer to those results. Editorial 
changes were also brought to the section 5.2 of the 
SmPC for Benlsyta 200 mg solution for injection and 
the section 5.1 of the SmPC for Benlysta 120 mg and 
400mg powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The RMP was updated to version 31 with 
the results from study BEL115471/ HGS1006-C1112.
in a randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo controlled, 
52-week Phase III/IV study (EMBRACE). Efficacy was 
evaluated in 448 patients. The proportion of black patients 
achieving an SRI-S2K response was higher in patients 
receiving Benlysta but the difference was not statistically 
significant compared with placebo. However, consistent 
with results from other studies, in black patients with high 
disease activity (low complement and positive anti-dsDNA 
at baseline, n=141) the SRI-S2K response was 45.1% for 
Benlysta 10 mg/kg compared with 24.0% for placebo (odds 
ratio 3.00; 95% CI: 1.35, 6.68).

a international Phase 3 Study and in one Phase 3 extension

The data showed that beyond the first 76 weeks of 
treatment, B cell reductions either stabilize (as for naïve 
and plasma B cells), or continue to gradually decrease (as 
for CD19+ /C20+ B cells, memory cells, plasmacytoid B 
cells) ultimately leading to net reductions of about 80-90% 
for naïve as well as CD19/CD20+ B cells and of about 50-
60% for plasma cells after 3 years of continued belimumab 
dosing. Furthermore a 20% to 30% median reduction in 
IgG levels after 3 years of treatment were observed. The 
SmPC of Benlysta was updated accordingly with this 
information on pharmacodynamic effects.

As a condition to approval, the MAH was originally required 
to change the design and the due date of the post-
marketing safety study. This variation is submitted 
following the assessment of FUM 003. Furthermore, 
the MAH proposed changes related to the 
implementation of the new QRD template v8.0.
C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and 
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation
to provide 5-year data from a randomized, controlled large 
safety study. In this variation procedure, the MAH proposed 
a change to the original safety study of long-term 
belimumab exposure which will be now assessed in a set of 
two studies:
•
a 1-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled safety study in 5000 patients investigating the 
incidence of all-cause mortality and adverse events of 
special interest including serious infections (including non-
serious and serious opportunistic infections and PML) 
malignancies (including non-melanoma skin cancer), 
serious infusion and hypersensitivity reactions, and serious 
psychiatric events including mood disorders, anxiety and 
suicide. 
•
a large, prospective, controlled, observational 
registry where 2000 patients receiving commercial 
belimumab will be followed for 5 years to estimate the 
incidence of all-cause mortality and the incidence of rare 
events, such as malignancies, selected serious psychiatric 
events as well as serious infections (including opportunistic 
infections and PML) as compared with 1000 patients of the 
control group.
The new design and due dates as proposed by the MAH are 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. The CHMP considers 
that these two studies will satisfy the need for additional 
safety data as determined at time of initially requesting the 
conduct of a large 5-year randomised controlled safety 
study therefore replacing the previously agreed study 
against these two studies is accepted.

Benlysta. Following further clarification and the provision of 
necessary information, the CHMP agreed to the proposed 
SmPC changes introducing the term bacterial infections

Following review of a total of 18 spontaneous post-
order to update the safety information regarding 
hypersensitivity and infusion reactions. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the 
MAH took this opportunity to introduce minor 
editorial changes in section 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC 
and to update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet.
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data
marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions, an 
update of the product information was agreed to 
strengthen the warning regarding potentially serious and 
life-threatening hypersensitivity and infusion reactions after 
Benlysta administration. Symptoms may develop or reoccur 
in a delayed fashion, several hours after completion of the 
infusion. Currently available data do not seem to indicate a 
predictive pattern linking infusion reactions to certain 
characteristics pertaining to, for example, history of 
allergies, medical history or concomitant medications. 
Therefore, patients should remain under prolonged clinical 
supervision following administration of Benlysta.

A DHPC and communication plan has been agreed with the 
CHMP and will be sent to Health Care Professionals to 
increase awareness about this safety issue and the revised

The median study duration was 24.9 months at the time of 
the primary EFS analysis and 47.2 months at the time of 
the primary OS analysis. The primary analysis of OS was 
performed at the protocol-specified timepoint of 5 years 
from the first subject enrolled. A statistically significant 
improvement in OS in favour of Yescarta was 
demonstrated. The estimated 48-month OS rates were 
54.6% in the Yescarta arm and 46.0% in the SOCT arm. 
Fifty-seven percent of patients received cellular 
immunotherapy after no response to or relapse after 
randomisation to SOCT. The OS HR for Yescarta versus 
SOCT was 0.735 [95% CI: 0.338, 1.600] for patients with 
HGBL per central laboratory.

SmPC, Annex 
In the 24-month follow-up analysis of study ZUMA-1 and 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
II, Labelling 
based on the mITT population (results from an independent 
data 
and PL 
review committee), the Objective Response Rate and the 
Complete Response rate were 74% and 54%, respectively.  
The median time to response was 1.0 months (range: 0.8 
to 12.2 months). The Duration of Response was longer in 
patients who achieved Complete Response compared to 
patients with a best response of Partial Response. Of the 55 
patients who achieved CR, 7 patients had SD and 10 had 
PR at their initial tumour assessment and converted to CR 
as late as 12 months after YESCARTA infusion.  Median 
duration of response and median overall survival have not 
been reached. 
Due to the on-target, off-tumour effect of YESCARTA, a 
period of B-cell aplasia is expected following treatment. 
Among 73 patients with evaluable samples at baseline, 
40% had detectable B cells; the B cell aplasia observed in 
the majority of patients at baseline was attributed to prior

therapies. Following YESCARTA treatment, the proportion 
of patients with detectable B cells decreased: 20% had 
detectable B cells at Month 3, and 22% had detectable B 
cells at Month 6. The initiation of B cell recovery was first 
noted at Month 9, when 56% of patients had detectable B- 
cells. This trend of B- cell recovery continued over time, as 
64% of patients had detectable B- cells at Month 18, and 
77% of patients had detectable B- cells at Month 24. It is 
important to note that patients were not required to be 
followed after they progressed; thus, the majority of 
patients with evaluable samples were responders.

I.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 the MAH provides the final clinical 
study report for the study ‘A Multicenter, Randomized, controlled Study to Compare the Safety, 
Tolerability and Immunogenicity of Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (Alternative Manufacturing 
Process [AMP]) with the Vaccine ProQuad (2006 Process) in Healthy US Children’. 
Clinical Aspects 
Rationale for the study 
A modification to the VZV vaccine harvesting process to achieve a higher potency bulk and ensure 
adequate supply of ProQuad is referred to as the Harvest Virus Fluids concentration process (HVFc). 
The study was planned to further investigate the potential impact of the process specification change 
on safety, and was requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Centers for Biological 
Evaluation and Research (CBER). The clinical study should be added to the life cycle plan for ProQuad 
Refrigerated to evaluate safety and immunogenicity with HVFc , referred to as ProQuad Refrigerated 
manufactured with an Alternative Manufacturing Process (Protocol 027). 
Study design 
Study P027 was double-blind study evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of two doses 
90 days apart of ProQuad Refrigerated manufactured with an Alternative Manufacturing Process 
MMRV(AMP) in comparison with ProQuad old process 2006 (subcutaneous administration) in 1,400 
healthy children. Blood samples were to be obtained just prior to vaccination (Day 1) and at 6 weeks 
(between Days 43 and 56) after first vaccination. The safety follow-up period after each dose was 
planned to be 42 days following each vaccination using diary cards. The study has been conducted in 
the US in 2012-2013. 
The intended study population was healthy children, 12 months to 23 months of age, who had a 
negative clinical history for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and herpes zoster. Exclusion criteria 
included previous vaccination with measles, mumps, rubella, and/or varicella vaccines (either alone or 
in any combination) and an inactive or live vaccine within 14 days and 30 days respectively prior to 
administration of the first dose of the study vaccine, as well as congenital or acquired immune 
deficiency. 
Approximately 1,400 subjects were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either MMRV 
(AMP) on Day 1 and Day 90, or ProQuad on Day 1 and Day 90.  
The primary objectives of study P027 were threefold: (1) To demonstrate that the MAHs measles, 
mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine MMRV Vaccine (Alternative Manufacturing Process [AMP]) 
induces measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibody responses 6 weeks 
Postdose 1 that are non-inferior to those induced by ProQuad (2006 Process), (2) To demonstrate that 
MMRV Vaccine (AMP) induces acceptable measles, mumps, rubella, and VZV antibody responses 6 
weeks Postdose 1, and (3) To demonstrate that the rate of fever following the first vaccination with 
MMRV Vaccine (AMP) is non-inferior to that following the first vaccination of ProQuad (2006 Process).

Secondary objective was to assess the overall safety and tolerability of MMRV Vaccine (AMP) when 
administered to children 12 to 23 month of age. 
Primary immunogenicity analyses were performed for the antibody response rates and GMTs at 6 
weeks postvaccination in the group receiving MMRV Vaccine (AMP) and the group receiving ProQuad 
2006. The population for the primary immunogenicity analysis was the Per-Protocol population.  
A supportive summary and analysis for measles, mumps, rubella, and VZV immunogenicity was based 
on the full analysis set (FAS) of all subjects with a valid serology measurement, regardless of protocol 
violations. Subjects were included in the vaccination group associated with the first vaccine received 
for the FAS populations. This analysis did not account for missing data. As a supportive analysis, the 
primary immunogenicity hypotheses were evaluated on the FAS to assess the robustness of the 
conclusions based on the Per-Protocol population. With respect to measles, mumps, rubella, and 
varicella the GMTs six weeks postvaccination of the study vaccines were summarized, and the 95% CI 
of the ratio of GMTs was provided.  
The primary safety endpoint was the rate of fever (temperature ≥ 102.2°F [39.0°C] oral equivalent) 
from Days 1 to 5 Postdose 1. 
All subjects were followed for safety (daily temperatures, injection-site adverse events, and systemic 
adverse events) for 42 days after each vaccination. All subjects were followed for serious adverse 
events and febrile seizures from the time of enrollment until the end of the study. In addition, 
medically-attended events were collected through 180 days after completing the 42-day safety follow-
up Postdose 2. The parent/guardian was instructed to contact study personnel if the subject developed 
a measles-like rash, a rubella-like rash, a varicella-like rash, a zoster-like rash, or symptoms 
compatible with mumps. In this event, the subject was examined by a study physician as soon as 
possible but no later than 72 hours (3 days) following the onset of symptoms. 
Results 
Study population 
In total 1.412 out of the 1,400 children planned to be enrolled were actually randomized to one of the 
two vaccination groups (MMRV [AMP]: 698 children; ProQuad: 702 children). All children were 12 to 23 
months of age and both vaccination groups were comparable with respect to gender, age at 
vaccination, race and ethnicity. A total of 1,232 subjects (88%) completed the study. Most of the 
remaining subjects were lost to follow up (2.8%) and 2 subjects withdrew their consent. One subject 
discontinued due to and adverse events (constipation, pyrexia and vomiting) in the ProQuad group. 
Safety evaluation 
The primary safety hypothesis involved demonstrating non-inferiority between groups with respect to 
the rates of fever (temperature ≥102.2°F [≥39.0°C] oral equivalent) from Days 1 to 5 following the 
first vaccination. The number of subjects who experienced temperatures ≥102.2°F [≥39.0°C] in each 
vaccination group was comparable (risk difference 0.2%, 95% CI [-1.0%, 1.3%]). Six (6, 0.9%) 
subjects in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group and 5 (0.8%) subjects in the ProQuad (2006 Process) 
group experienced temperatures ≥102.2°F [≥39.0°C]. The proportion of subjects who reported fever 
≥39.0°C was balanced. The non-inferiority margin for the rate of fever (temperature ≥102.2°F [≥
39.0°C] oral equivalent) from Days 1 to 5 following the first vaccination in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) as 
compared to the ProQuad (2006 Process) was achieved since the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI 
on the risk difference was less than 5%.

The majority of subjects in both vaccination groups reported at least one systemic adverse event 
Postdose 1 during days 1 to 42 [429 (62.9%) subjects in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group and 397 
(58.2%) subjects in the ProQuad (2006 Process) group]. Most systemic adverse events were General 
disorders and administration site conditions [25.5% of subjects from the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group 
and 22.4% of subjects from the ProQuad (2006 Process) group] and Infections and infestations [32% 
of subjects from the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group and 34.2% of subjects from the ProQuad (2006 
Process) group]. The most frequently reported systemic clinical adverse event (≥10% in any 
vaccination group) was pyrexia [23.5% in subjects vaccinated with the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) and 
21.1% in subjects vaccinated with the ProQuad (2006 Process)]. 
The vaccination groups were comparable in regards to systemic events Postdose 1. Only rash maculo-
papular was more often reported after administration of MMRV vaccine (1.6%) compared to ProQuad 
vaccines (0.4%). Of the 11 rash maculo-papular events reported in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group, 8 
(72.7%) were mild in intensity and the remaining 3 (27.3%) were moderate in intensity. All 3 (100%) 
maculo-papular events reported in the ProQuad (2006 Process) group were mild in intensity. 
The number and percentage of subjects who reported specific systemic clinical adverse events with an 
incidence ≥1% in either vaccination group during Days 1 to 42 Postdose 2 are presented by SOC, 
preferred term, and vaccination group in Table 2.

Table 2: Analysis of systemic clinical AEs in one or more vaccination groups Days 1 to 42 Postdose 2 
During Days 1 to 42 Postdose 2 the majority of subjects in both vaccination groups reported at least 
one systemic adverse event [326 (51.4%) subjects in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group and 337 
(53.3%) subjects in the ProQuad (2006 Process) group]. Most systemic adverse events were infections 
and infestations [29.7% of subjects from the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group and 30.1% of subjects from 
the ProQuad (2006 Process) group]. The most frequently reported systemic clinical adverse event (≥
10% in any vaccination group) was pyrexia [14.5% in subjects vaccinated with the MMRV Vaccine 
(AMP) and 17.6% in subjects vaccinated with the ProQuad (2006 Process)]. 
Overall the incidence of systemic AEs was comparable Postdose 2. Rash and ear infections were 
observed in unbalanced frequency. Postdose 2 rash was more frequently reported from ProQuad

vaccinees (3.3%) in comparison to MMRV-vaccinees (1.6%). The observed proportions of subjects 
reporting ear infection were 1.9% and 0.6% for the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group and the ProQuad 
(2006 Process) group, respectively (risk difference 1.3%, 95% CI [0.0%, 2.7%]). Of the 12 ear 
infection events reported in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group, 2 (16.7%) were mild in intensity 8 
(66.7%) were moderate in intensity, and 2 (16.7%) were severe in intensity. Of the 4 ear infection 
events reported in the ProQuad (2006 Process) group, 2 (50%) were mild in intensity and 2 (50%) 
were moderate in intensity. 
The number and percentage of subjects in each vaccination group who experienced VRC-solicited 
injection-site adverse events and unsolicited injection-site adverse events (≥1% of subjects in one or 
more vaccination groups) during Days 1 to 5 Postdose 1 are presented in Table 3. Risk differences 
[MMRV Vaccine (AMP) minus ProQuad (2006 Process)], associated 95% CIs, and selected p-values 
were provided. 
The MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group experienced more injection-site adverse events during Days 1 to 5 
Postdose 1 as compared to the ProQuad (2006 Process) group (risk difference 6.9%, 95% CI [1.9%, 
11.9%]). Both vaccination groups had more than 10% of subjects with each of the VRC-solicited 
injection-site adverse events (erythema, pain/tenderness, and swelling). The MMRV (AMP) group 
experienced statistically significantly more (p=0.001) erythema events (156 [22.9%]) than the 
ProQuad (2006 Process) group (108 [15.8%]). The rates of pain/tenderness and swelling were similar 
between both vaccination groups. Injection-site bruising was the only unsolicited event reported by ≥ 
1% of subjects in one of the vaccination groups [MMRV Vaccine (AMP): 1.3%; ProQuad (2006 
Process): 0.9%]. All injection-site adverse events were considered vaccine-related with the exception 
of 1 subject with 2 erythema events from the ProQuad (2006 Process) group. None of the injection-site 
adverse events reported were associated with a hospitalization or discontinuation from the study.

events days 1 to 5 Postdose 1 
The safety profile was comparable between both vaccination groups according to the reported 
frequency of rashes and fever, which was the objective of the trial. The occurrence of injection site AEs 
was reported by 3 subjects in the ProQuad group and none in the MMRV (AMP) group.

Two non-serious-adverse experiences during the 6-week postvaccination period were reported: one of 
diaper dermatitis and one of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder. Both were observed in the 
ProQuad group. 
One subject of the MMRV (AMP) group reported two SAEs, because the boy was hospitalized and 
treated for fever and systemic measles-like rash. Onset of fever was at day 10 after vaccination and 
lasted 4 days with moderate intensity, while the rash started on day 11 and was resolved after 7 days. 
Intensity of the rash was not reported. 
Overall, the analysis from the small number of recruited children showed a similar safety profile in both 
vaccination groups, which was observed in correlated trials for the approval of ProQuad. 
Distribution of maximum reported sizes of injection site erythema and swelling were comparable 
between both vaccination groups.  
Extended Safety Period Summary 
Clinical adverse events reported during the extended safety period (Day 43 to Day 180 Postdose 2) 
were generally comparable between the 2 vaccination groups in terms of the incidence rates of serious 
adverse events, medically-attended adverse events, and new or worsening chronic medical conditions 
that did not meet the definition of a serious adverse event. Most of these events were Infections and 
infestations and were mostly of mild intensity. 
Eight (8; 1.3%) subjects in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group experienced serious adverse events and 7 
(1.2%) subjects in the ProQuad (2006 Process) group experienced serious adverse events. No subject 
from either vaccination group experienced a serious vaccine-related adverse event. 
Frequency of febrile seizures was balanced in both vaccination groups during the 42 days following 
each vaccination. Three (3) febrile seizures 1 in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group and two in the 
ProQuad (2006 Process group] were experienced during the 42-day Postdose 1 period. All 3 events 
occurred during the expected period of Days 6 to 13 Postdose 1, and all were considered to be 
vaccine-related. The concurrent conditions of the subjects experiencing these febrile seizures included 
pyrexia, fussiness, loose stools, and status epilepticus. The subjects experienced peak temperatures of 
101.1ºF, 102.1ºF, and 100.5ºF. One (1) febrile seizure [subject from the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group] 
was experienced during the 42 day.  
There were more febrile seizures reported outside the primary study period after days 42 to 180 
Postdose 2 in the MMRV group compared to the ProQuad group. Outside the primary safety period, 6 
subjects in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group compared with zero in the ProQuad (2006 Process) group 
reported a first occurrence of a febrile seizure. For most of these events, the subjects had either a risk 
factor for febrile seizures (family history) or a documented concurrent febrile illness. In addition, the 
number of febrile seizures observed in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group is consistent with what would be 
expected for this study population based on estimates from incidence rates and time of follow up. The 
observed imbalance between vaccination groups in the numbers of first occurrences of febrile seizures 
outside the primary safety period is unlikely to be related to any true incidence difference between the 
2 vaccination groups.

Safety conclusion 
The 2 vaccination groups were generally comparable in terms of the incidence rates of adverse events 
overall, systemic adverse events, and serious adverse events. Subjects in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) 
group did experience statistically significantly more rash maculo-papular events than subjects in the 
ProQuad (2006 Process) group (1.6% and 0.4 %) Postdose 1. Postdose 2 subjects in the ProQuad 
group experienced more rashes than subjects in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group (3.3% and 1.6%). 
The number of subjects with vaccine-related adverse events Postdose 1 and Postdose 2 was 
statistically significantly higher in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group than in the ProQuad (2006 Process) 
group. The majority of local reactions were reported as injection-site pain and injection-site erythema 
and were reported more frequently in the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) group than in the ProQuad (2006 
Process) group. However the safety profile of MMRV Vaccine (AMP) and ProQuad after two doses 90 
days apart was comparable and no changes need to be added to the SmPC section 4.8. 
Immunogenicity 
The first primary immunogenicity hypothesis involved demonstrating non-inferiority between 
vaccination groups with respect to the response rate 6 weeks Postdose 1 for each antibody (response 
rate: measles: ≥255 mIU/mL; mumps: ≥10 mumps antibody units/mL; rubella: ≥10 IU/mL; VZV: ≥5 
gpELISA units/mL). 
Immunogenicity results for each of the primary and secondary hypotheses are summarized in the 
following Tables 4 and 5.  
Table 4: Statistical analysis (non-inferiority) of risk difference in response rates to Measles, Mumps, 
Rubella, and VZV 
The results demonstrated non-inferiority of the response rate for each antibody 6 weeks Postdose 1 in 
the MMRV Vaccine (AMP) as compared to the ProQuad (2006 Process) (ie, the lower bound of the 2-
sided 95% CI on the risk difference was >-5% for measles, mumps, rubella, and >-10% for VZV). 
The second primary immunogenicity hypothesis involved demonstrating non-inferiority between 
vaccination groups with respect to the GMTs for each antibody 6 weeks Postdose 1. The Per-Protocol 
population for each antigen included subjects who were initially seronegative for that antigen at 
baseline (seronegative antibody titers: measles: <255 mIU/mL; mumps: <10 mumps antibody 
units/mL; rubella: <10 IU/mL; and VZV: <1.25 gpELISA units/mL). The statistical criterion for non-

EMA/246946/2015 
Page 10/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inferiority with respect to GMTs for each antigen requires that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI 
for each GMT ratio [MMRV Vaccine (AMP)/ProQuad (2006 Process)] be >0.67. A statistical analysis of 
the risk difference in the GMTs to measles, mumps, rubella, and VZV between vaccination groups in 
the Per-Protocol population Postdose 1 can be found in Table 5. 
Table 5: Statistical analysis (non-inferiority) of risk difference in GMT to Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and 
VZV between vaccination groups Postdose 1 
The non-inferiority hypothesis was met for measles, mumps, rubella, and VZV. 
Immunogenicity conclusion 
The immunogenicity analysis from the recruited subjects indicated that the 6-week postvaccination 1 
response rates and GMTs for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in the two vaccination groups are 
comparable and non-inferior. Both immunogenicity hypotheses were met. 
II.  RAPPORTEUR’S  OVERALL  CONCLUSION  AND  FURTHER  ACTION  IF 
REQUIRED 
Study P027 revealed no new information regarding the immunogenicity or safety profile of MMRV(AMP) 
that are not reflected in the currently approved product information of ProQuad. Hence, no amendment 
to the approved product information is required.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cerliponase alfa, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Information on anaphylaxis has been included in the SmPC, based on two reports that occurred during 
the reporting period; one spontaneous case and one clinical trial case. ‘Anaphylactic reaction’ is to be 
included in section 4.8 with the frequency ‘common’ and section 4.4 is to be revised regarding 
information on ‘anaphylactic reactions’. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cerliponase alfa the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing cerliponase alfa is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

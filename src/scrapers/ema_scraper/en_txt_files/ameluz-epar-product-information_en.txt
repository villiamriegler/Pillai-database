CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of actinic keratosis of mild to moderate severity (Olsen grade 1 to 2; see section 5.1) and of 
field cancerization in adults. 
Treatment of superficial and/or nodular basal cell carcinoma unsuitable for surgical treatment due to 
possible treatment-related morbidity and/or poor cosmetic outcome in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology in adults 
For treatment of actinic keratoses (AK) of the face or scalp, one session of photodynamic therapy 
(with natural daylight or a red-light or artificial daylight lamp) shall be administered for single or 
multiple lesions or entire fields with cancerization (areas of skin where multiple AK lesions are 
surrounded by an area of actinic and sun-induced damage within a limited field).  
For treatment of actinic keratoses (AK) in the body region trunk, neck or extremities, one session of 
narrow-spectrum red-light photodynamic therapy shall be administered.  
Actinic keratosis lesions or fields shall be evaluated three months after treatment. Treated lesions or 
fields that have not completely resolved after 3 months shall be retreated.  
For treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), two sessions of photodynamic therapy with red-light 
lamp shall be administered for one or multiple lesions with an interval of about one week between 
sessions. Basal cell carcinoma lesions shall be evaluated three months after last treatment. Treated 
lesions that have not completely resolved after 3 months shall be retreated.  
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Ameluz in the paediatric population. No data are available.

Method of administration 
Ameluz is for cutaneous use.  
Ameluz should be administered under the guidance of a physician, a nurse or other healthcare 
professional experienced in the use of photodynamic therapy. When a red-light or an artificial daylight 
lamp is required, the treatment should be performed by a healthcare professional. 
Treatment of AK, field cancerization and BCC using a red-light lamp: 
a)  Preparation of the lesions: Before administration of Ameluz, all lesions should be carefully wiped 
with an ethanol or isopropanol-soaked cotton pad to ensure degreasing of the skin. Scales and 
crusts should be removed accurately and all lesion surfaces roughened gently. Care should be 
taken to avoid bleeding. Nodular BCC lesions are often covered by an intact epidermal keratin 
layer which should be removed. Exposed tumour material should be removed gently without any 
attempt to excise beyond the tumour margins. 
b)  Application of the gel: Ameluz should be applied to the lesion area or entire cancerized fields and 
approximately 5 mm of the surrounding area in a film of about 1 mm thickness (about 20 cm2 area 
per tube). The gel should be applied using glove-protected fingertips or a spatula, and it should be 
allowed to dry for approximately 10 minutes, before a light-tight dressing is placed over the 
treatment site. Following 3 hours of incubation, the dressing should be removed and the remnant 
gel wiped off.  
The gel can be administered to healthy skin around the lesions. Direct contact of Ameluz with the 
eyes or mucous membranes should be avoided (keep a distance of 1 cm). In case of accidental 
contact, rinsing with water is recommended. 
c)  Illumination: After cleaning the lesions, the entire treatment area will be illuminated with a red 
light source, either with a narrow-spectrum around 630 nm and a light dose of approximately 
37 J/cm2 or a broader and continuous spectrum in the range between 570 and 670 nm with a light 
dose between 75 and 200 J/cm2. It is important to ensure that the correct light dose is 
administered. The total light dose is determined by factors such as the irradiance (or equivalent), 
the size of the light field, the distance between lamp and skin surface, and the illumination time. 
These factors vary with lamp type. The light dose delivered should be monitored if a suitable 
detector is available. During illumination the lamp should be fixed at the distance from the skin 
surface that is indicated in the user manual. See also section 6.6. 
A narrow-spectrum lamp is recommended to achieve higher clearance rates. Symptomatic 
treatment of transient adverse site reactions may be considered. A broader and continuous 
spectrum may be used if narrow-spectrum light sources are not tolerated (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  
Note: Efficacy of Ameluz in the treatment of AK in the body regions trunk, neck and extremities 
has been demonstrated only in the scope of narrow-spectrum PDT. There are no data for these 
body regions with broader spectrum lamps PDT or with natural or artificial daylight PDT.  
Lesions should be re-assessed after three months, at which point any residual lesions or fields may be 
retreated. It is recommended that the response of BCC lesions may be confirmed by histological 
examination of biopsy material, if considered necessary. Subsequently, close long-term clinical 
monitoring of BCC is recommended, with histology if necessary. 
Treatment of AK and field cancerization of the face and scalp with natural or artificial daylight: 
a)  Considerations before treatment:  
Natural daylight PDT should only be used if the conditions are suitable to stay comfortably 
outdoors for two hours (with temperatures > 10 °C). If the weather is rainy, or is likely to become 
so, natural daylight treatment should not be used. 
For natural daylight PDT, sunscreen should be applied 15 min prior to lesion pretreatment in 
order to protect sun exposed skin. Only sunscreen with chemical filters and SPF 30 or higher 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be used. Sunscreens with physical filters such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, etc. should 
not be used, as these inhibit light absorption and may therefore impact efficacy. 
For artificial daylight PDT, sunscreen is not needed, as patients are not exposed to ultraviolet light 
during illumination. 
b)  Preparation of the lesions: Before administration of Ameluz, all lesions should be carefully wiped 
with an ethanol or isopropanol-soaked cotton pad to ensure degreasing of the skin. Scales and 
crusts should be removed accurately and all lesion surfaces roughened gently. Care should be 
taken to avoid bleeding.  
c)  Application of the gel: A thin layer of Ameluz should be applied to the lesion area or entire 
cancerized fields and approximately 5 mm of the surrounding area using glove-protected 
fingertips or a spatula. No occlusive dressing is necessary during incubation.  It can be used 
optionally for artificial daylight PDT, but it should be removed before illumination at the latest. 
The gel can be administered to healthy skin around the lesions. Direct contact of Ameluz with the 
eyes or mucous membrane should be avoided (keep a distance of 1 cm). In case of accidental 
contact, rinsing with water is recommended. The gel should not be wiped off during the entire 
daylight PDT.  
d)  Incubation and illumination using daylight for AK treatment:  
Natural daylight PDT:  
If conditions are suitable (see section a. Considerations before treatment), patients shall go outside 
within 30 minutes after application of the gel and stay for 2 continuous hours in full daylight. 
Taking shelter in the shade in hot weather is acceptable. Interruption of the time outdoors should 
be compensated by a longer illumination time. Remaining gel should be removed after completion 
of light exposure. 
Artificial daylight PDT:  
To ensure sufficient protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis, the total treatment time (covering 
incubation and illumination) should be 2 hours and should not exceed 2.5 hours. However, 
illumination should start within 0.5 to 1 hour after gel application to avoid excessive PpIX 
accumulation, which might lead to increased pain sensation. The illumination time may vary due 
to different characteristics (e.g. irradiance and light spectrum) of the CE marked medical devices 
for artificial daylight PDT. The devices should have either a continuous or an intermittent 
spectrum covering one or more of the PpIX absorption peaks/bands in the range between 400 and 
750 nm. All studied artificial daylight devices with proven PpIX activating activity at least 
addressed the red PpIX absorption peak at about 631 nm. In order to ensure that the correct light 
dose is administered, light dose and illumination conditions recommended in the user manuals of 
the artificial daylight devices should be considered. However, the minimal applied dose at the 
lesions surface should not be less than ~14 J/cm². Patient and operator should adhere to safety 
instructions provided with the light source. Remaining gel should be removed after completion of 
light exposure. 
Lesions should be re-assessed after three months, at which point any residual lesions or fields may be 
retreated.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Risk of Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be a precipitating factor for transient global amnesia in very rare 
instances. Although the exact mechanism is not known, stress and pain associated with PDT may 
increase the risk to develop transient amnesia. If amnesia is observed, the PDT must be discontinued 
immediately (see section 4.8). 
Use of immunosupressants 
As inflammatory response is important for the effect of PDT, the trials investigating the efficacy and 
safety of Ameluz excluded patients who were undergoing treatment with immunosuppression therapy. 
No experience exists for the use of Ameluz in patients taking immunosuppressants. Therefore, the use 
of immunosuppressants during treatment with Ameluz is not recommended. 
Ameluz should not be used on bleeding lesions 
Any bleeding must be stopped before application of the gel. No experience exists for the use of 
Ameluz in patients with inherited or acquired coagulation defects. Special care should be taken to 
avoid bleeding during lesion preparation in such patients (see section 4.2). 
Risk of mucous membrane and eye irritation 
Ameluz can cause mucous membrane or eye irritation. The excipient sodium benzoate may be mildly 
irritant to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Propylene glycol may cause irritation.  
Special care should be taken to avoid applying Ameluz into eyes or to mucous membranes. In case of 
accidental contact, the site must be rinsed with water. 
Ameluz should not be used on skin areas affected by other diseases or tattoos. 
The success and assessment of treatment may be impaired if the treated area is affected by the 
presence of skin diseases (e.g. skin inflammation, located infection, psoriasis, eczema, and malignant 
skin cancers other than indicated) as well as tattoos. No experience exists with these situations. 
Intensive lesion preparation might lead to increased pain 
Some intensive lesion preparation protocols (e.g. chemical peel followed by ablative laser) might 
increase the frequency and intensity of pain sensation during PDT. This was noticed in the scope of 
artificial daylight PDT but should also be considered for red-light PDT and natural daylight PDT. 
Ameluz transiently increases phototoxicity  
Any UV-therapy should be discontinued before treatment. As a general precaution, sun exposure on 
the treated lesion sites and surrounding skin should be avoided for approximately 48 hours following 
treatment. Concomitant use of medicinal products with known phototoxic or photoallergic potential 
such as St. John’s wort, griseofulvin, thiazide diuretics, sulfonylureas, phenothiazines, sulphonamides, 
quinolones and tetracyclines may enhance the phototoxic reaction to photodynamic therapy. 
Risk of allergic reaction 
Ameluz contains soybean phosphatidylcholine and should not be applied to patients known to be 
allergic to peanut or soya (see section 4.3).  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Ameluz does not significantly increase the natural plasma levels of 5-aminolaevulinic acid or 
protoporphyrin IX following topical application (see section 5.2). 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of 
5-aminolaevulinic acid in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of Ameluz during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether 5-aminolaevulinic acid/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued for 12 hours after treatment 
with Ameluz. 
Fertility 
There are no data available on the effect of 5-aminolaevulinic acid on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ameluz has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials with Ameluz, local skin reactions at the application site were observed in most of the 
subjects treated for actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma. This is to be expected as the therapeutic 
principle of photodynamic therapy is based on phototoxic effects of protoporphyrin IX which is 
synthesized from the active ingredient 5-aminolaevulinic acid.  
The most common signs and symptoms are application site irritation, erythema, pain, and oedema. The 
intensity of these effects is dependent on the type of illumination used for photodynamic therapy. The 
increased effects correlate with the higher clearance rate of red-light narrow spectrum lamps (see 
section 5.1). In rare cases, adverse reactions, e.g. pain, required interruption or discontinuation of the 
illumination.  
The study of Ameluz using natural and artificial daylight showed similar types of side effects. 
However, intensity of some adverse reactions, particularly pain, was lower when Ameluz was used in 
combination with daylight PDT. 
Most adverse reactions occur during illumination or shortly afterwards. The symptoms are usually of 
mild or moderate intensity (investigator’s assessment on a 4-point scale), and last for 1 to 4 days in 
most cases; in some cases, however, they may persist for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The incidence of adverse reactions in 624 subjects exposed to photodynamic therapy with Ameluz in 
pivotal clinical trials is listed below. All these adverse reactions were non serious. The table 
additionally includes serious adverse reactions reported post-marketing. Frequencies are defined as 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare 
(≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose following topical administration is unlikely and has not been reported in clinical studies. If 
Ameluz is accidentally ingested, systemic toxicity is unlikely. Protection from sun light exposure for 
48 hours and observation are nevertheless recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, sensitizers used in photodynamic/radiation 
therapy, ATC code: L01XD04 
Mechanism of action 
Following topical application of 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), the substance is metabolized to 
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a photoactive compound which accumulates intracellularly in the treated 
lesions. PpIX is activated by illumination with light of a suitable wavelength and energy. In the 
presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are formed. The latter causes damage of cellular 
components and eventually destroys the target cells.  
When Ameluz is used with the red-light PDT protocol, PpIX accumulates intracellularly in the target 
cells during incubation under light-tight dressing. The subsequent illumination activates the 
accumulated porphyrins and thus leads to phototoxicity for the light-exposed target cells. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When Ameluz is used with natural or artificial daylight PDT protocols, PpIX is continuously produced 
and activated within the target cells during light exposure, resulting in a constant micro-phototoxic 
effect. No occlusive dressing is necessary, but it can be used optionally during incubation for artificial 
daylight PDT.  
PDT with artificial daylight devices showed comparable results to PDT with natural daylight. 
Artificial daylight PDT devices may vary in terms of specific light spectrum, irradiance and 
illumination time. The analysis of exemplary artificial daylight devices (i.e. MultiLite®, Medisun® 
PDT 9000, and indoorLux®) indicated sufficient PpIX activation by all tested devices.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) and field cancerization: 
Efficacy and safety of Ameluz for the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) has been evaluated in 746 
patients enrolled in clinical trials. In clinical phase III, a total of 486 patients were treated with 
Ameluz. All patients had at least 4 mild to moderate actinic keratosis lesions. The application site 
preparation and duration of incubation followed the description under section 4.2. If not completely 
cleared 12 weeks after initial treatment, lesions or cancerized fields were treated a second time with an 
identical regimen. 
A)  Photodynamic therapy with red-light for AK of face and scalp 
In study ALA-AK-CT002, a randomised, observer blinded clinical trial with 571 AK patients and a 
follow-up duration of 6 and 12 months, photodynamic therapy with Ameluz was tested for non-
inferiority to a commercially registered cream containing 16% methyl-aminolevulinate (MAL, methyl-
[5-amino-4-oxopentanoate]) and superiority over placebo. The red light source was either a narrow 
light spectrum lamp (Aktilite CL 128 or Omnilux PDT) or a lamp with a broader and continuous light 
spectrum (Waldmann PDT 1200 L, or Hydrosun Photodyn 505 or 750). The primary endpoint was 
complete patient clearance 12 weeks after the last photodynamic therapy. Ameluz (78.2%) was 
significantly more effective than MAL (64.2%, [97.5%- confidence interval: 5.9; ∞]) and placebo 
(17.1%, [95%-confidence interval: 51.2; 71.0]). Total lesion clearance rates were higher for Ameluz 
(90.4%) compared to MAL (83.2%) and placebo (37.1%). Clearance rates and tolerability were 
dependent on the illumination source. The following table presents the efficacy and the adverse 
reactions transient pain and erythema occurring at the application site during photodynamic therapy 
with different light sources:

Clinical efficacy was re-assessed at follow-up visits 6 and 12 months after the last photodynamic 
therapy. Recurrence rates after 12 months were slightly better for Ameluz (41.6%, [95%-confidence 
interval: 34.4; 49.1]) as compared to MAL (44.8%, [95%-confidence interval: 36.8; 53.0]) and 
dependent on the light spectrum used for illumination, in favour of narrow spectrum lamps. Prior to 
the decision to undergo photodynamic therapy it should be taken into consideration that the probability 
of a subject to be completely cleared 12 months after the last treatment was 53.1% or 47.2% for 
treatment with Ameluz and 40.8% or 36.3% for MAL treatment with narrow spectrum lamps or all 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lamp types, respectively. The probability of patients in the Ameluz group to require only 1 treatment 
and remain completely cleared 12 months after the photodynamic therapy was 32.3%, that of patients 
in the MAL group 22.4% on average with all lamps.  
Cosmetic outcome assessed 12 weeks after the last photodynamic therapy (with baseline sum score 0 
excluded) was judged as: very good or good in 43.1% of subjects in the Ameluz group, 45.2% in the 
MAL group and 36.4% in the placebo group; and unsatisfactory or impaired in 7.9%, 8.1% and 18.2% 
of subjects, respectively. 
In study ALA-AK-CT003, Ameluz was also compared with placebo treatment in a randomised, 
double-blind clinical trial enrolling 122 AK patients. The red light source provided either a narrow 
spectrum around 630 nm at a light dose of 37 J/cm2 (Aktilite CL 128) or a broader and continuous 
spectrum in the range between 570 and 670 nm at a light dose of 170 J/cm2 (Photodyn 750). The 
primary endpoint was complete patient clearance after 12 weeks following the last photodynamic 
therapy. Photodynamic therapy with Ameluz (66.3%) was significantly more effective than with 
placebo (12.5%, p < 0.0001). Total lesion clearance was higher for Ameluz (81.1%) compared to 
placebo (20.9%). Clearance rates and tolerability were dependent on the illumination source in favour 
of the narrow spectrum light source. Clinical efficacy was maintained during the follow-up periods of 
6 and 12 months after the last photodynamic therapy. Prior to the decision to undergo photodynamic 
therapy it should be taken into consideration that the probability of a subject to be completely cleared 
12 months after the last treatment was 67.5% or 46.8% for treatment with Ameluz with narrow 
spectrum lamps or all lamp types, respectively. The probability to require only one treatment with 
Ameluz and remain completely cleared 12 months later was 34.5% on average with all lamps.

In both AK studies ALA-AK-CT002 and -CT003 the clearance rates were higher after illumination 
with narrow light spectrum devices but the incidence and intensity of administration site disorders 
(e.g. transient pain, erythema) increased in patients illuminated with these devices (see tables above 
and section 4.8). 
The cosmetic outcome was assessed as very good or good in 47.6% of the subjects in the Ameluz 
group compared to 25.0% of subjects in the placebo group. An unsatisfactory or impaired cosmetic 
outcome was judged for 3.8% of the subjects in the Ameluz group and in 22.5% of the subjects in the 
placebo group. 
Field cancerization is characterised by an area of skin where multiple AK lesions are present and there 
is likely to be an underlying and surrounding area of actinic damage (a concept known as field 
cancerization or field change); the extent of this area may not be evident visually or by physical 
examination. In a third randomised, double-blind clinical trial, ALA-AK-CT007, enrolling 87 patients, 
Ameluz and placebo were compared on entire treatment fields (field cancerization) containing 4 to 8 
AK lesions in a field area of maximum 20 cm2. The red light source provided a narrow spectrum 
around 635 nm at a light dose of 37 J/cm2 (BF-RhodoLED). Ameluz was superior to placebo with 
respect to patient complete clearance rates (90.9% vs. 21.9% for Ameluz and placebo, respectively; 
p < 0.0001) and lesion complete clearance rates (94.3% vs. 32.9%, respectively; p < 0.0001), as 
controlled 12 weeks after the last PDT. 96.9% of patients with AK on the face or forehead were 
cleared from all lesions, 81.8% of patients with AK on the scalp were totally cleared. Lesions of mild 
severity were cleared by 99.1% vs. 49.2%, those of moderate severity by 91.7% vs. 24.1% for 
treatment with Ameluz and placebo, respectively. After only 1 PDT complete patient clearance 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resulted in 61.8% vs. 9.4%, and complete lesion clearance in 84.2% vs. 22.0% for Ameluz and 
placebo treatment, respectively. 
Clinical efficacy was maintained during the follow-up periods of 6 and 12 months after the last PDT. 
After Ameluz treatment, 6.2% of the lesions were recurrent after 6 and additionally 2.9% after 
12 months, respectively (placebo: 1.9% after 6 and additionally 0% after 12 months, respectively). 
Patient recurrence rates were 24.5% and 14.3% after 6 months, and additionally 12.2% and 0% after 
12 months for Ameluz and placebo, respectively. 
The field treatment applied in this study allowed the assessment of skin quality changes at baseline 
and 6 and 12 months after the last PDT by severity. The percentage of patients with skin impairment 
before PDT and 12 months after PDT is listed in the table below. All skin quality parameters in the 
treated area continuously improved up to the 12-month follow-up time point.

B) Photodynamic therapy with red-light for AK in the region trunk, neck and extremities  
In clinical trial ALA-AK-CT010, the efficacy of Ameluz in the treatment of AK on other body regions 
(extremities, trunk and neck) was compared with placebo treatment in a randomized, double-blind, 
intra-individual Phase III clinical trial comparing 50 patients with 4-10 AKs on opposite sites of the 
extremities and/or the trunk/neck. The red light source provided a narrow spectrum around 635 nm at 
a light dose of 37 J/cm2 (BF-RhodoLED). The primary endpoint was total lesion clearance 12 weeks 
after the last photodynamic therapy. Ameluz was superior to placebo with respect to mean lesion 
complete clearance rates (86.0% vs. 32.9%, respectively) and patient complete clearance rates (67.3% 
vs. 12.2% for Ameluz and placebo, respectively), as controlled 12 weeks after the last PDT, whereas 
the rate of lesions assessed as fully cleared by the investigator and simultaneously cleared according to 
histopathology of a biopsy was lower in both groups: 70.2% in the Ameluz and 19.1% in the placebo 
group.  
C) Photodynamic therapy with natural daylight for AK of the face or scalp 
The efficacy of Ameluz in combination with natural daylight PDT was tested in a randomised, 
observer-blind, intra-individual phase III clinical trial (ALA-AK-CT009) enrolling 52 patients with 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3-9 AKs on each side of the face and/ or scalp. Ameluz was tested for non-inferiority to a cream 
containing 16% methyl-aminolevulinate (MAL, methyl-[5-amino-4-oxopentanoate]) commercially 
registered for natural daylight PDT. Each side of the face/scalp was treated with one of the two 
products. Natural daylight PDT was performed outdoors for 2 continuous hours in full daylight. On 
sunny days, shelter in the shade could be taken should the patient feel uncomfortable in direct sunlight. 
Rainy periods or time required indoors prolonged the outdoor exposure accordingly. Natural daylight 
may not be sufficient for Ameluz daylight treatment during winter months in certain parts of Europe. 
Ameluz natural daylight photodynamic therapy is feasible all year long in southern Europe, from 
February to October in middle Europe, and from March to October in northern Europe. 
The complete lesion clearance rate for Ameluz in combination with a single natural daylight PDT was 
79.8%, compared to 76.5% for comparator MAL. The study demonstrated the non-inferiority of 
Ameluz compared to MAL cream [lower 97.5% -confidence limit 0.0]. Adverse events and tolerability 
were comparable for both treatments. Clinical efficacy was re-assessed at follow-up visits 6 and 12 
months after the last natural daylight PDT. Mean lesion recurrence rates after 12 months were 
numerically lower for Ameluz (19.5%) as compared to MAL (31.2%).

Treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC): 
Efficacy and safety of Ameluz for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with a thickness of 
< 2 mm has been evaluated in 281 patients enrolled in a phase III clinical trial (ALA-BCC-CT008). In 
this study a total of 138 patients were treated with Ameluz. All patients had 1 to 3 BCC lesions on the 
face/forehead, bald scalp, extremities and/or neck/trunk. In this study, photodynamic therapy with 
Ameluz was tested for non-inferiority to a cream containing 16% methyl-aminolevulinate (MAL, 
methyl-[5-amino-4-oxopentanoate]). The red light source provided a narrow spectrum around 635 nm 
at a light dose of 37 J/cm2 (BF-RhodoLED). The primary endpoint was complete patient clearance 
12 weeks after the last photodynamic therapy.  
The complete patient clearance rate for Ameluz was 93.4%, compared to 91.8% for the comparator 
MAL. The study demonstrated the non-inferiority of Ameluz compared to MAL cream [97.5% -
confidence interval -6.5]. Of the BCC lesions, 94.6% were cleared with Ameluz, 92.9% with MAL. 
For nodular BCC, 89.3% of the lesions were cleared with Ameluz, 78.6% with MAL. Adverse events 
and tolerability were comparable for both treatments.  
Clinical efficacy was re-assessed at follow-up visits 6 and 12 months after the last photodynamic 
therapy. Lesion recurrence rates after 6 and 12 months were 2.9% and 6.7%, respectively, for Ameluz, 
and 4.3% and 8.2% for MAL.

Patient distribution in the subgroups was similar for both products and represents the distribution in 
the general population, where more than 70% of BCCs are located in the head/trunk region. BCCs 
located in this region mainly belong to the superficial subtype. In conclusion, even though subgroup 
sizes are too small to draw significant conclusions on individual groups, the distribution of the two 
products to the relevant subgroups is very similar. Thus, it seems not plausible that this could 
negatively impact the non-inferiority claim of the primary study endpoint or the general trends 
observed across all subgroups. 
In a clinical trial designed to investigate the sensitization potential of ALA with 216 healthy subjects, 
13 subjects (6%) developed allergic contact dermatitis after continuous exposure for 21 days with 
doses of ALA that were higher than doses normally used in the treatment of AK. Allergic contact 
dermatitis has not been observed under regular treatment conditions. 
Actinic keratosis lesion severity was graded according to the scale described by Olsen et al., 1991 
(J Am Acad Dermatol 1991; 24: 738-743): 
Grade 
none 
mild 
0 
1 
Clinical description of severity grading 
no AK lesion present, neither visible nor palpable 
flat, pink maculae without signs of hyperkeratosis and erythema, slight palpability, 
with AK felt better than seen 
2  moderate  pink to reddish papules and erythematous plaques with hyperkeratotic surface, 
3 
severe 
moderately thick AK that are easily seen and felt 
very thick and / or obvious AK 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Ameluz in all subsets of the paediatric population in actinic keratosis. A class waiver exists for basal 
cell carcinoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In vitro dermal absorption into human skin was studied using Ameluz containing radiolabelled 
5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA). After 24 hours, the mean cumulative absorption (including 
accumulation in the dermis) through human skin was 0.2% of the administered dose. Corresponding 
studies in human skin with actinic keratosis lesions and/or roughened surface were not performed. 
Distribution 
In a phase II clinical trial, 5-aminolaevulinic acid and protoporphyrin IX serum levels and ALA urine 
levels were measured before, 3 and 24 hours after administration of Ameluz for photodynamic 
treatment. None of the post-dose levels were increased in comparison to the naturally occurring pre-
dose levels, showing absence of a relevant systemic absorption after topical administration. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A maximal use PK study was conducted in 12 patients bearing at least 10 mild to moderate AKs on 
the face or forehead. An entire tube of placebo and Ameluz followed by PDT was applied in a fixed 
sequence design with a washout period of 7 days to evaluate baseline and Ameluz dependent plasma 
concentrations of ALA and PpIX. In most patients an up to 2.5-fold increase of basic ALA plasma 
concentrations was observed during the first 3 hours after Ameluz application, which is still within the 
normal range of previously reported and published endogenous ALA concentrations. The plasma 
concentrations of metabolite PpIX were generally low in all patients and in none of the patients, an 
obvious increase of PpIX plasma concentrations was observed after Ameluz application. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on dermal toxicity studies or studies 
reported in the literature of repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with ALA.

Each lamp should be used according to the user manual. Only CE marked lamps should be used, 
equipped with the necessary filters and/or reflecting mirrors to minimize exposure to heat, blue light 
(only for red-light PDT) and ultra violet (UV) radiation. The technical specifications of the device 
need to be checked before using a specific light source, and the requirements must be met for the 
intended light spectrum. Both the patient and the medical personnel conducting the photodynamic 
therapy should adhere to any safety instructions provided with the light source used. During 
illumination, patient and medical personnel should wear suitable protective goggles for red-light PDT 
and where recommended for artificial daylight PDT. There is no need to protect healthy untreated skin 
surrounding the treated lesions.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.   What Ameluz is and what it is used for 
Ameluz contains the active substance 5-aminolaevulinic acid. It is used to treat: 
• 
slightly palpable to moderately thick actinic keratoses or entire fields affected by actinic 
keratoses in adults. Actinic keratoses are certain changes in the outer layer of the skin that can 
lead to skin cancer. 
superficial and/or nodular basal cell carcinoma unsuitable for surgical treatment due to 
possible treatment-related morbidity and/or poor cosmetic outcome in adults. Basal cell 
carcinoma is a skin cancer that can cause reddish, scaly patches or one or several small bumps 
that bleed easily and do not heal.  
• 
After application, the active substance of Ameluz becomes a photoactive substance which accumulates 
in  affected  cells.  Illumination  with  appropriate  light  produces  reactive  oxygen-containing  molecules 
which act against the target cells. This therapy is known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). 
2.   What you need to know before you use Ameluz 
Do not use Ameluz 
• 
5-aminolaevulinic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
photoactive substances known as porphyrins 
soya or peanuts 
if you are allergic to 
– 
– 
– 
if you have impaired formation of red blood pigment called porphyria 
if you have other skin conditions caused by, or made worse by, exposure to light 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Ameluz. 
• 
In very rare cases photodynamic therapy may increase the risk of developing temporary 
memory loss.  
The use of Ameluz is not recommended if you use immunosuppressants. 
Avoid applying Ameluz  
to bleeding lesions 
– 
into eyes or to mucous membranes 
– 
• 
• 
• 
• 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
on skin areas affected by other diseases or tattoos, because this may hinder the success 
and assessment of the treatment. 
Intensive lesion preparation (e.g. chemical peel followed by ablative laser) might lead to 
increased pain during PDT. 
Discontinue any UV-therapy before treatment. 
Avoid sun exposure on the treated lesion sites and surrounding skin for approximately 48 hours 
following treatment. 
• 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents  
Actinic keratoses and basal cell carcinomas do not occur in children and adolescents, except in 
extremely rare cases. 
Other medicines and Ameluz 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  
Inform your doctor if you use medicines that increase allergic or other harmful reactions after light 
exposure, such as 
• 
• 
• 
St. John’s wort or its preparations: medicines to treat depression  
griseofulvin: a medicine to treat fungal infections 
medicines to increase water output through your kidneys with active substance names mostly 
ending in “thiazide” or “tizide”, such as hydrochlorothiazide 
certain medicines to treat diabetes, such as glibenclamide, glimepiride 
medicines to treat mental disorders, nausea or vomiting with active substance names mostly 
ending in “azine”, such as phenothiazine 
medicines to treat bacterial infection with active substance names beginning with “sulfa” or 
ending in “oxacin” or “cycline”, such as tetracycline 
• 
• 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ameluz is not recommended during pregnancy, due to insufficient knowledge. 
Breast-feeding should be interrupted for 12 hours after application of Ameluz. 
Driving and using machines 
Ameluz has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Ameluz contains 
• 
2.4 mg sodium benzoate (E211) in each gram of gel. Sodium benzoate may cause local 
irritation. 
soybean phosphatidylcholine: If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine. 
propylene glycol: May cause skin irritation. 
• 
• 
3.   How to use Ameluz 
Ameluz is only used on the skin. The treatment consists of application of Ameluz and light exposure. 
A therapy session can be administered for single or multiple lesions, or entire treatment fields. The 
illumination source for treatment of actinic keratoses lesions or fields can be daylight (natural or 
artificial) or a special red-light lamp. Your doctor will decide which treatment option to use, 
depending on your lesions.  
The illumination source for PDT should always be a red-light lamp in the treatment of actinic keratosis 
in the body regions trunk, neck and extremities and basal cell carcinoma.   
Treatment of lesions or fields of actinic keratoses and basal cell carcinoma using a red-light 
lamp 
The use of Ameluz with a red-light lamp requires specific equipment and knowledge in photodynamic 
therapy. Therefore, this treatment is performed in the doctor’s practice. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Preparation of the lesions  
The application area is wiped with an alcohol-soaked cotton pad to degrease the skin. Scales and 
crusts are carefully removed, and all lesion surfaces are gently roughened. Care is taken to avoid 
bleeding. 
Application of the gel  
Ameluz is applied to form a film of about 1 mm thickness to the entire lesions or fields and 
approximately 5 mm of the surrounding area using glove-protected fingertips or a spatula. A distance 
of at least 1 cm to eyes and mucous membranes is to be maintained. Rinse with water if such contact 
occurs. The gel is allowed to dry for approximately 10 minutes before placing a light-tight dressing 
over the treatment site. The dressing is removed after 3 hours. The remaining gel is wiped off. 
Illumination using a red-light lamp  
After cleaning, the entire treated area is illuminated using a red-light source. Efficacy and side effects 
such as temporary pain are dependent on the light source used. Both patients and healthcare 
professionals should adhere to any safety instructions provided with the light source used during 
therapy. All should wear suitable protective goggles during illumination. There is no need to protect 
healthy untreated skin. 
Treatment of lesions and fields of actinic keratoses on the face and scalp with natural daylight 
Considerations before treatment  
Only use natural daylight treatment if the weather is suitable to stay comfortably outdoors for two 
hours (with temperatures > 10 °C). If the weather is rainy, or is likely to become so, you should not 
use natural daylight treatment.  
Preparation of the lesions   
Apply sunscreen to sun exposed skin for sun protection 15 min before lesion treatment. Only use 
sunscreen with chemical filters and sun protection factor 30 or higher. Do not use sunscreen with 
physical filters such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, as these inhibit light absorption and may therefore 
impact efficacy. 
Then wipe the application area with an alcohol-soaked cotton pad to degrease the skin. Carefully 
removed scales and crusts and gently roughen all lesion surfaces. Take care to avoid bleeding.  
Application of the gel 
Apply Ameluz to form a thin layer to the entire lesions or fields and approximately 5 mm of the 
surrounding area using glove-protected fingertips or a spatula.   
Avoid any contact with the eyes and mucous membranes, keeping a distance of at least 1 cm. Rinse 
with water if such contact occurs. 
A light-tight dressing is not necessary. Do not wipe off the gel during the entire natural daylight 
treatment session.  
Illumination using natural daylight for actinic keratosis treatment 
If weather conditions are suitable (please see above; Considerations before treatment), you should go 
outside within 30 minutes after application of the gel and stay for 2 continuous hours in full daylight. 
Taking shelter in the shade in hot weather is acceptable. If the time outdoors is interrupted, you should 
compensate this with a longer illumination time. After the two hour light exposure, wash off the 
remaining gel. 
Treatment of lesions and fields of actinic keratoses of the face and scalp using an artificial 
daylight lamp 
The use of Ameluz with an artificial daylight lamp requires specific equipment and knowledge in 
photodynamic therapy. Therefore, this treatment is performed in the doctor’s practice.

Preparation of the lesions 
The application area is wiped with an alcohol-soaked cotton pad to degrease the skin. Scales and 
crusts are carefully removed, and all lesion surfaces are gently roughened. Care is taken to avoid 
bleeding. 
Application of the gel 
A thin layer of Ameluz is applied to the entire lesions or fields and approximately 5 mm of the 
surrounding area using glove-protected fingertips or a spatula. A distance of at least 1 cm to eyes and 
mucous membranes is to be maintained. Rinse with water if such contact occurs. 
Incubation and illumination using an artificial daylight lamp 
After application, total treatment (covering incubation and illumination) should be 2 hours and should 
not exceed 2.5 hours. However, illumination should start within 0.5 to 1 hour after gel application. 
During incubation, no occlusive dressing is necessary. It can be used optionally but should be removed 
before illumination at the latest. Both patients and healthcare professionals should adhere to any safety 
instructions provided with the light source used during therapy. There is no need to protect healthy 
untreated skin. After light exposure, the remaining gel is wiped off. 
Number of treatments 
• 
• 
Lesions and fields of actinic keratoses are treated with one session.  
Basal cell carcinoma is treated with two sessions, with an interval of one week between 
sessions.  
The treated lesions should be evaluated 3 months after treatment. Your doctor will decide how well 
each skin lesion has responded, and treatment may have to be repeated at this time.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. 
4.  
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Side 
effects at the application site occur in about 9 out of 10 users and indicate that the affected cells are 
responding to treatment. 
Generally, side effects are of mild or moderate intensity, typically occurring during illumination or 1 
to 4 days after. However, in some cases they may persist for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer. In rare cases, 
due to adverse reactions, e.g. pain, it may be necessary to interrupt or discontinue illumination. After 
more extended time periods, treatment with Ameluz frequently results in continued improvement of 
skin quality parameters. 
The side effects listed below have been reported when using Ameluz with a red-light lamp. The study 
of Ameluz using natural or artificial daylight showed similar types of side effects; however, 
particularly for pain, with lower intensity. Some reactions at the application site have been observed 
before the use of light.

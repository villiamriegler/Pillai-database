2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid 
β-glucosidase (also known as glucocerebrosidase). One of a group of inherited sphingolipidoses, GD 
is  a  multi-systemic  and  heterogeneous  disorder  that  is  a  serious  (and  chronically  debilitating) 
condition given the persistent and irreversible morbidity that will develop over time in the majority of 
patients. The classic manifestations of GD are organomegaly, haematological abnormalities, and bone 
disease. 
Acid  β-glucosidase  is  the  rate-limiting  enzyme  in  the  catabolism  of  complex  glycosphingolipids, 
catalysing the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide (GL-1) to glucose and ceramide. Glucosylsphingosine 
(also known as lyso-GL1), the deacylated form of GL-1, is a minor substrate for the same enzyme. 
Deficiency in acid β-glucosidase leads to the progressive accumulation of GL-1 (a major component of 
the plasma membranes of circulating blood cells), primarily in the lysosomes of macrophages. The 
hallmark of GD is the abundance of lipid-engorged macrophages with a characteristic “crinkled-paper” 
cytoplasmic  appearance  (Gaucher  cells)  in  organs  comprising  the  reticuloendothelial  system 
(primarily spleen, liver, and bone marrow, and to a lesser extent, lung). Macrophages are central to 
the pathophysiology of GD because of their active role in phagocytosing damaged and senescent cells 
that  are  constantly  being  produced  in  the  blood  (including  white  blood  cells,  red  blood  cells,  and 
platelets),  and  in  recycling  their  cellular  components.  The  decreased  ability  to  degrade  GL-1  (and 
other  complex  glycosphingolipids)  and  their  resulting  accumulation  leads  to  the  proliferation  of 
macrophages  and  their  subsequent  differentiation  into  chitotriosidase  and  CCL18  (Chemokine  CC 
motif ligand 18)-secreting Gaucher cells.  
Infiltration of the reticuloendothelial system by Gaucher cells gives rise to many of the cardinal clinical 
signs and symptoms of the disease: infiltration of the liver and spleen causes hepatosplenomegaly 
and  hypersplenism,  leading  to  anaemia  and  thrombocytopaenia;  infiltration  of  the  bone  marrow 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 9/75 
 
 
 
causes marrow infarction, pancytopaenia, and low bone mineral density (BMD); and less commonly, 
infiltration of the lungs causes interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension. This progressive 
organ pathology in turn gives rise to massive organomegaly with abdominal distention, discomfort, 
pain, and early satiety; fatigue; easy bruising/bleeding; splenic rupture; chronic bone pain and acute 
bone crises; osteonecrosis; marrow infarction; and pathological fractures.  
Three  main  clinical  types  of  GD  have  been  described,  all  of  which  are  inherited  in  an  autosomal 
recessive manner and caused by mutations in the GBA gene located at chromosome 1q22. The most 
common form, Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), has historically been characterised as lacking central 
nervous system (CNS) involvement, although in recent years it has become more appreciated that a 
small percentage of GD1 patients may develop peripheral neuropathy (<15%), and that both GD1 
patients and carriers have an increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease in adulthood. Gaucher 
disease type 2 (GD2) is the acute neuronopathic form that presents in early infancy and leads to death 
by age 3. Gaucher disease type 3 (GD3) is the chronic neuronopathic form that presents from late 
infancy onward and has a lifespan that may extend into early adulthood1. 
Gaucher  disease  is  an  orphan  disease.  The  prevalence  of  GD  (all  types)  is  approximately  0.3  per 
100,000  in  the  general  population,  with  GD1  being  the  most  common  subtype.  Estimates  of  the 
prevalence for GD1 range widely by geography and ethnicity (Grabowski, 1997, Genet Test). 
Two treatment approaches aimed at lowering GL-1 levels are currently available for GD1: (1) enzyme 
replacement  therapy  (ERT)  with  recombinant  acid  β  -glucosidase,  which  augments  the  deficient 
enzyme activity in patients and catabolises stored GL-1 in lysosomes, and (2) substrate reduction 
therapy  (SRT),  which  acts  by  partially  inhibiting  the  enzyme  glucosylceramide  synthase,  thereby 
reducing  rate  of  synthesis  of  GL-1  to  better  match  the  impaired  rate  of  catabolism  in  patients. 
Currently, there are two approved recombinant ERTs for the treatment of GD in the EU: imiglucerase 
(Cerezyme®)  and  velaglucerase  alfa  (VPRIV™).  The  currently  available  ERT  requires  regular 
intravenous (IV) infusions (generally every 2 weeks) for the duration of a patient's lifetime. Oral SRT, 
which  acts  by  partially  inhibiting  the  enzyme  glucosylceramide  synthase,  represents  a  more 
convenient alternative therapeutic strategy for GD. The only currently approved SRT option available 
for patients with GD1 is miglustat (ZavescaTM). Miglustat is a second-line therapy (indicated in adult 
patients with mild to moderate GD1 for whom ERT is not a therapeutic option).  
Eliglustat (Cerdelga) is a potent and specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, and acts as a SRT 
for GD1. The goal of this approach is to reduce the rate of synthesis of glucosylceramide to match its 
impaired rate of catabolism in patients with GD1, thereby preventing glucosylceramide accumulation 
and alleviating clinical manifestations. The drug substance, eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638), is an 
L-tartaric acid salt, and exists in plasma as a free base, Genz-99067, which is the active moiety. In 
this AR, "eliglustat" is used when referring to the drug product administered in each clinical study, and 
"Genz-99067" is used when referring to clinical drug exposure (i.e., concentrations in plasma or other 
tissues). 
The Applicant applied for the following indication: “Cerdelga is indicated for the long-term treatment 
of  adult  patients  with  Gaucher  disease  type  1  (GD1).  The  target  population  is  patients  who  are 
CYP2D6 intermediate (IM) or extensive (EM) metabolisers”. 
The  CHMP  granted  the  following,  modified  indications:  “Cerdelga  is  indicated  for  the  long-term 
treatment of adult patients with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers 
(PMs), intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive metabolisers (EMs)”.

is  not  hygroscopic.  Two  molecules  of  eliglustat  form  a  salt  with  one  molecule  of  tartaric  acid 
counter-ion. 
Eliglustat exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres, both of which have R 
configuration. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and specific optical rotation. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for Eliglustat tartrate. 
Eliglustat tartrate is a new active substance and neither eliglustat, nor an isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative or salt, have been previously authorised as medicinal products in the European 
Union.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Eliglustat tartrate  is  synthesized  by  a  single  manufacturer  in  seven  main  steps  using  well-defined 
commercially available starting materials. Starting materials were re-defined during the procedure at 
the request of CHMP, and as a result, development and validation of new analytical methods for the 
Cerdelga

re-defined  materials  is  required  but  could  not  be  achieved  during  the  procedure.  Although  no 
immediate  impact  on  quality  is  envisaged,  the  development  and  validation  of  these  analytical 
methods is considered vital to maintain quality throughout the lifecycle of the product. The applicant 
has committed to completing this work within 6 months of granting of the marketing authorisation. 
Both stereocentres are introduced selectively under substrate control. The only potential genotoxic 
compound is used in an early step and is eliminated by the process and controlled in intermediate 
specifications. 
Quality by Design (QbD) methodology was used in the development of the manufacturing process 
including  risk  assessment  (fishbone  and  FMEA),  design  of  experiments  (DoE)  and  multi-variate 
models for some steps in the process. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance were 
identified and linked to those of the finished product, and are well controlled by the process. They 
include  levels  of  organic  impurities,  enantiomeric  purity,  residual  solvents,  residual  metals  and 
inorganic impurities. Critical process parameters (CPPs) with an impact on CQAs were identified, and 
suitable limits for these have been set in the process description. However, neither a design space, 
nor proven acceptable ranges (PARs) are claimed by the applicant and the QbD aspects were used 
only to ensure a robust process was developed. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification is based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQAs) 
and includes tests for appearance (visual), colour (visual), identity (FTIR, RP-HPLC), thermal analysis 
(DSC),  assay  (RP-HPLC),  impurities  (RP-HPLC),  chiral  analysis  (chiral  HPLC),  counter  ion  (ion 
exclusion  HPLC), residual solvents (GC), elemental impurities (Ph. Eur.) and residue on ignition (Ph. 
Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data on 25 pilot and commercial scale batches of the active substance used for stability, 
registration, and clinical trials are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent 
from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data were provided for 13 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer used for clinical trials and registration and stored in a container closure representative 
of the intended commercial package for up to 5 years under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
and for up to 12 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH). Results of 4 batches stored 
under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) were also provided. Of the batches tested, 4 were 
manufactured using the intended commercial process whilst 9 were produced using an earlier process. 
The  differences  between  the  earlier  process  and  the  final  commercial  process  are  minor  and  are 
unlikely to impact stability. The storage conditions used are in accordance to the ICH guidelines.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015

Results  from  forced  degradation  studies  were  also  provided  on  one  batch  exposed  to  a  range  of 
conditions including high temperature, high humidity, in the presence of an oxidant, and in an open 
container. Analysis included tests for appearance, colour identity, thermal analysis, impurities, chiral 
analysis, counter ion, elemental impurities and assay. The analytical methods used were the same as 
for release and were stability indicating. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Pharmaceutical development was aimed at developing an immediate release hard gelatin capsule for 
oral administration containing 84.4 mg of eliglustat. 
Eliglustat tartrate is highly soluble but has poor flow properties and thus development focused on the 
selection of excipients to improve its flow. Studies were undertaken to determine the compatibility of 
filler, binder, lubricant and the capsule shells with the active substance. The result of these studies 
indicated  that  a  combination  of  lactose  monohydrate  and  microcrystalline  cellulose  as  fillers,  and 
hypromellose  E15  as  binder  conferred  the  best  flow  properties  on  the  granules  and  these  were 
therefore selected as excipients for the final formulation. The ratio of excipients was optimized to 
further improve flow properties. The inclusion of excipients had no negative impact on the solubility of 
eliglustat in the finished product. The finished product shows dissolution rate typical of immediate 
release hard gelatin capsules. 
Different formulations were used for different phases of the clinical trials and comparative dissolution 
studies demonstrated that minor changes in the formulations were unlikely to have any detectable 
impact  on  formulation  quality  and  in  vivo  performance.  In  addition,  a  bioequivalence  study  was 
performed,  showing  bioequivalence  between  the  phase  III  clinical  formulation  and  the  proposed 
commercial formulation. 
Hard  gelatin  and  hypromellose  capsules  were  both  evaluated  during  development.  Hard  gelatin 
capsules were selected because they exhibited a faster dissolution profile. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The  pharmaceutical  development  of  the  finished  product  contains  QbD  elements.  The  QTPP  was 
defined  as  an  immediate  release  capsule  containing  the  requisite  quality  and  quantity  of  active 
substance, stable over the targeted shelf-life of the finished product. Dissolution, appearance, assay, 
content uniformity, specified degradation products and integrity of primary packaging for moisture 
protection were identified as CQAs. 
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design 
of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. A risk 
analysis  was  performed  using  the  failure  mode  effect  analysis  (FMEA)  method  in  order  to  define 
critical process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on the finished product 
quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar 
formulations  and  manufacturing  processes  as  well  as  on  the  experience  from  formulation 
development,  process  design  and  scale-up  studies.  The  critical  process  parameters  have  been 
adequately identified. The CPPs identified are weight of drug substance dispensed and quantity of 
purified water added at granulation. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has also been 
demonstrated. 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 13/75 
 
 
 
The  primary  packaging  is  aluminium  PETG/COC.PETG/PCTFE-aluminium  blisters.  The  material 
complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  the  following  main  steps:  dispensing  and  mixing  of  active 
substance and excipients, wet granulation, drying, milling and blending, filling and encapsulation, and 
finally, packaging and release. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Dispensing of an accurate quantity of eliglustat and water for granulation are essential to finished 
product  quality  and  are  thus  considered  critical  steps.  In  addition,  moisture  content,  capsule  fill 
weight, and appearance are monitored by in-process controls to ensure finished product quality. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications contain appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and 
include appearance of the contents (visual inspection), appearance of the capsule (visual inspection), 
identity (HPLC and UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage forms (Ph. 
Eur.), microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.) and dissolution (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production and fifteen pilot scale batches confirming the 
consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended  product 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three production scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions 
(25ºC / 60% RH) and under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 36 months and for up 
to 6 months  under accelerated conditions (40 ºC /75% RH) according to the  ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, 
degradation products, dissolution, moisture and microbial enumeration. Moisture was evaluated for 
information purposes only. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The only trends of 
note were a 4% decrease in assay for 1 batch at intermediate conditions after 36 months and a 0.5% 
increase in water content after 6 months at accelerated conditions. However, all test results complied 
with the proposed specifications and the observed changes are not of concern. 
In addition, 3 batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. 
Results  of  storage  under  stressed  conditions  were  also  provided  for  three  batches.  Stressed 
conditions included temperature cycling for up to 24 days, high temperature and humidity, and high 
temperature  in  an  open  container.  The  finished  product  is  not  photosensitive  but  degradants  are 
produced  at  high  temperature  and  humidity,  under  which  conditions,  the  gelatin  hard  capsules 
become brittle due to cross-linkage. However, since this has not been observed under non-stressed 
storage, special storage conditions are not required. 
Based on the available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and Veterinary Medicinal 
Products. 
Gelatin obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. A valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatin used in the manufacture is provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and  finished 
product  and  the  manufacturing  process.  However,  no  design  spaces  were  claimed  for  the 
manufacturing processes of the active substance or the finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH’s to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
the  applicant  should  develop,  validate  and  implement  analytical  methods  to  control  quality  of  2 
re-defined starting materials. 
1.  For  the  first  starting  material,  an  HPLC  method  is  required  to  control  impurities  and  once 
implemented, the specification should be revised to include limits for unspecified and total impurities. 
2. For the second starting material, a GC assay and impurities method is required. 
3. Also for the second starting material, the control of certain solvents (DMF, EtOAc, PE) is required by 
adding  limits  to  the  specification  or  demonstrating  absence  in  a  suitable  intermediate  or  active 
substance based on batch history. 
The  MAH  has  agreed  to  address  these  recommendations  within  6  months  of  the  granting  of  a 
marketing authorization.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  drug  substance  used  in  nonclinical  studies  was  physically  and  chemically  comparable  to  that 
produced  for  clinical  trials  and  ultimately  for  marketing.  The  nonclinical  pharmacology  studies 
conducted with eliglustat showed potent and specific inhibition of glucosylceramide (GL-1) synthesis 
in vitro and reduced levels of GL-1 in vivo in both normal mice and Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) 
mouse models, confirming the mechanistic basis for the eliglustat pharmacological effect. In addition 
to  these  pharmacodynamic  studies  and  a  number  of  investigative  pharmacology  and  toxicology 
studies,  the  nonclinical  program  for  eliglustat  included  a  comprehensive  program  of  safety 
pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  (PK),  genotoxicity,  reproductive  toxicity,  acute-dose  and 
repeat-dose  toxicology,  juvenile  toxicology,  and  carcinogenicity  studies.  Although  the  target 
population of the proposed indication does not include pediatrics, the juvenile toxicology studies were 
conducted as part of a paediatric investigational plan. Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in two 
species, the mouse and the rat. 
All the pivotal preclinical safety studies were conducted in compliance with a GLP. Dose range finding 
studies do not all claim GLP compliance but were conducted in a GLP-compliant facility. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies were conducted with eliglustat to determine the potency and efficacy in cell systems. 
Reduction in GL-1 was measured in a human microsome assay with an IC50 of around 20 nM. Similar 
IC50 values were seen in whole cells (human K562 erythropoietic cells), using membrane expression 
of GM1 as endpoint. In murine and canine cells, potency was a little lower with IC50 values of around 
60 nM and 80 nM respectively. No studies have been performed with human Gaucher cells. 
None  of  the  10  metabolites  of  eliglustat  had  IC50  values  in  the  nM  range,  indicating  that  these 
metabolites do not contribute to the pharmacological activity of eliglustat. Potency was measured as 
inhibition of GL-1 in microsomes, or inhibition of GM3 surface expression in intact cells. 
Several  studies  were  performed  with  an  in  vivo  mouse  Gaucher  disease  model  (D409V/null  GD1 
mice), in which GL1 levels as biomarker in liver, spleen and lung begin to accumulate measurably 
starting at 3 months of age, and Gaucher cells begin to appear by 4 months of age. In-feed dosing 
appeared to be more efficacious than dosing by oral gavage, presumably due to a more sustained 
delivery of the drug. Doses from 150 mg/kg/day up to 450 mg/kg/day were tested, which showed 
greater efficacy for the higher doses: GL-1 levels were reduced up to 80% in liver, and 70-80% in lung 
and spleen. At the lower dose of 150 mg/kg/day, further accumulation of GL-1 was inhibited, but 
limited effect was seen on the “debulking” of cells with high GL-1 levels. Pre-treatment of mice with 
imiglucerase (currently used for treatment of GD), resulted in “debulking” the cells of GL-1, which was 
further  reduced  or  maintained  by  subsequent  treatment  with  eliglustat,  most  effectively  at  450 
mg/kg/day. The effect of imiglucerase on GL-1 levels in lung tissue is limited, due to the restricted 
distribution to alveolar macrophages. Treatment with eliglustat has an additional effect on lung GL-1 
levels, reducing it further from 40% to 80%. 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 16/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To quantify the Gaucher cells, staining of the liver with CD68, a general marker for macrophages, was 
performed.  Treatment  with  eliglustat  caused  a  reduction  in  CD68  positive  staining.    Only  limited 
toxicokinetic  parameters  were  measured  in  these  studies  which  cannot  be  compared  to  clinical 
parameters, but from the repeated dose toxicity studies it can be deduced that the exposures in these 
studies are higher than the clinical exposure in patients at all tested doses.  
In addition to the GD1 mouse disease model, efficacy of eliglustat in terms of reduction in plasma 
GL-1 levels was also evaluated in healthy animals. A modest effect of up to 30% reduction in GL-1 
plasma levels was achieved in rats at doses of 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg when dosed for 4 days. Plasma 
GL-1 was not evaluated in the GD1 mouse model, and therefore these values cannot be compared to 
the  disease  model.  Despite  a  clear  increase  in  exposure  at  higher  doses,  no  dose  response 
relationship was observed in healthy rats. In dogs, liver GL1 was measured, which also showed a 
decrease after treatment with up to 25 mg/kg/day for up to 13 weeks, of around 50% compared to 
untreated controls. The effect was reversible, as shown by normalization of GL1 levels at 2 weeks 
after treatment cessation. As with rats, the effect was not dose-related. Although the doses used in 
healthy rats and dogs are lower than the doses used in the GD1 mouse model, exposures are likely 
higher, based on data from the repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  a  receptor  screen,  eliglustat  showed  significant  inhibition  of  ligand  binding  at  9  targets,  when 
tested in a panel of 80 different receptors, transporters, and ion channels at 10 µM. These included 
the dopamine receptors D3 and D4.4, the serotonin receptors 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT6, 
the mu opioid receptor, the nonspecific sigma receptor, and the Ca2+ ion channel (L, verapamil site). 
Although the concentration of 10 µM was much higher than the predicted systemic Cmax in patients, 
high  local  concentrations  in  the  gut  could  be  reached.  Indeed,  in  pre-clinical  species,  effects  on 
gastrointestinal transit were seen. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No  effects  on  CNS  parameters  were  observed  after  treatment  of  rats  with  up  to  400  mg/kg  of 
eliglustat. A reversible decrease in respiratory rate was seen in rats treated with 400 mg/kg. 
Severe effects on gastrointestinal transit were observed in rats treated with 100 mg/kg or higher. 
Transit  was  (almost)  completely  inhibited.  This  effect  could  be  due  to  high  local  concentration  of 
eliglustat, leading to interactions with secondary targets as seen in the receptor screen. Other effects 
on the GI tract have been observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies. 
The hERG channel assay showed that eliglustat has a potential for prolongation of the action potential 
and the QT interval from a concentration of 0.1 µg/ml. Subsequent studies on sodium and calcium 
channels also showed a potential for blockade of these ion channels, with IC50 values of 5.2 and 10.4 
µg/ml, respectively. Effects on cardiac action potential in dog Purkinje fibres are in line with effects 
seen  for  the  sodium  and  calcium  channels.  From  a  concentration  of  0.3  µg/ml  or  higher,  action 
potential parameters were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. This is in contrast to the hERG 
channel assay, which indicates a possible prolongation of the action potential. Overall, from in vitro 
and ex vivo studies it can be concluded that at concentrations of 0.1 µg/ml or above, eliglustat is 
expected to have direct effects on QRS complex duration and QT interval. This concentration is around 
2-fold above the mean predicted clinical Cmax of 44.3 ng/ml. Several cardiovascular effects were seen 
in two in vivo dog studies. In telemetered conscious dogs, no effects were seen at a dose of 3 mg/kg 
resulting in a Cmax around 6.5-fold of the clinical Cmax, while higher doses showed increases in QRS 
duration, PR interval and heart rate, and a decrease in RR interval. In the cardiac conduction study in 
anesthetized dogs no NOEL could be determined, as all doses showed increases in atrio-ventricular 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 17/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and intra-ventricular conduction times and intra-ventricular velocity. Prolongation of the QT interval 
(adjusted  for  the  decrease  in  heart rate)  was  also observed  at  the  mid  dose. No  relevant  activity 
against the hERG channel, cardiac sodium or calcium channels was observed for the 10 metabolites of 
eliglustat. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  meaningful  pharmacodynamic  interaction  was  observed  between  eliglustat  and  imiglucerase, 
which indicates that both drugs can be used simultaneously in patients. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Eliglustat is a highly permeable drug and is rapidly absorbed. Bioavailability is low in all non-clinical 
species suggesting the involvement of transporters and/or extensive first-pass metabolism. Systemic 
exposure increases in a more than dose-proportional manner in rats over the  dose range 5 to 50 
mg/kg/day  and  over  the  dose  range  15  to  50  mg/kg/BID,  while  dose-proportional  increases  are 
observed between 50 and 100 mg/kg/BID. In dogs, systemic exposure increases dose-proportional in 
males and more than dose-proportional in females over the dose range 2 to 10 mg/kg. Multiple dosing 
generally  leads  to  slight  accumulation  in  rats  and  dogs.  In  juvenile  rats,  maximum  plasma 
concentrations are reached later than in adults. Compared to adults, AUCs were slightly higher while 
the Cmax was lower at the same dose. Exposure reduced over the study period indicating an increase 
in enzyme activity and/or transporter activity that is consistent to what is known about the ontology 
of the enzymes involved in the biotransformation of eliglustat.  
Distribution 
The generally high volumes of distribution across the non-clinical species indicate extensive tissue 
distribution  of  eliglustat.  However,  the  extent  of  distribution  is  concentration-dependent  as  the 
plasma-protein  binding  diminishes  at  increasing  plasma  concentrations  leading  to  higher  free 
fractions available for distribution to tissues. At clinically relevant concentrations, the free fraction is 
significant  lower  in  the  non-clinical  species  than  in  humans.  Drug-derived  radioactivity  is  widely 
distributed to body tissues and still present after 12 to 24 hours in several tissues, mainly associated 
with absorption, metabolism and excretion. Drug-related material may cross the blood-brain and the 
blood-testes barrier, and may bind, although not irreversibly, to melanin. No significant red blood cell 
partitioning is observed for eliglustat. Placental transfer of trace amounts of eliglustat and metabolites 
was observed in rats . 
Metabolism 
Eliglustat is extensively metabolised in all non-clinical species, but major species differences exist. 
CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 are involved in the metabolism, with CYPs 2D6 and 3A4 involved at 
clinically  relevant  concentrations.  Metabolic  pathways  involve  sequential  oxidation  of  the  octanoyl 
moiety being the major pathway, followed by oxidation of the 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxane moiety 
or a combination of oxidation in the two moieties. In addition, rat specific pathways are identified.   
Excretion 
Elimination  of  eliglustat  is  rapid  with  generally  high  systemic  clearances  and  very  short  plasma 
half-lives of within 1.5 hour for all non-clinical species. Drug clearance is preliminary determined by 
hepatic clearance while renal clearance is negligible. Eliglustat is hence predominantly excreted via 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 18/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
faeces in the non-clinical species. In urine, eliglustat is mainly excreted as metabolites. Excretion of 
trace amounts of eliglustat and/or its related materials into milk was observed in rats . 
Transporters 
Eliglustat  is  a  substrate  for  the  efflux  transporter  P-gp  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations.  No 
BCRP-mediated  transport  of  eliglustat  is  expected  in  the  intestine  or  uptake  via  OATP1B1  and 
OATP1B3 in the portal vein. 
Drug interactions 
Eliglustat is not expected to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, OAT1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT3 and OCT2 at 
clinically relevant systemic concentrations, although it is an inhibitor of these transporters. At portal 
vein  concentrations  however,  eliglustat  may  inhibit  OCT1.  In  the  intestine,  inhibition  of 
P-gp-mediated transport cannot be excluded. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Acute dose toxicity studies were performed in rat and dog, which served to determine dose levels for 
following repeated dose toxicity studies. Single IV dosing of 3 up to 20 mg/kg in rat was well tolerated 
and the acute NOAEL for one-hour IV infusion was considered to be 20 mg/kg. Single dosing of rat 
with 200 up to 1000 mg/kg eliglustat or repeated dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg for 10 and 3 days 
respectively administered via oral gavage was not well tolerated. The maximum tolerated dose was 
below 200 mg/kg. For dogs treated with a single dose 25, 35, 50 and 100 mg/kg eliglustat in fasted 
and fed state and repeatedly dosed with 25 mg/kg for 10 days the MTD was determined as 25 mg/kg 
in fed animals. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In mice, single and repeated dose studies not conducted under GLP resulted in the design of a 13 
week repeated dose GLP study in mice. In this study, CD-1 mice were administered 0, 50, 150 and 
350  mg/kg  eliglustat  per  day.  Animals  treated  with  higher  dose-levels  of  eliglustat  (≥  350 
mg/kg/day)  showed  a  decrease  in  body  weight.  Observed  increase  in  weight  of  liver  and  adrenal 
glands cannot be explained due to missing secondary symptoms, but are regarded as target organs. 
The  remainder  of  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  with  eliglustat  was  executed  in  rat  and  dog. 
Treatment  with  eliglustat  showed  adverse  effects  on  GI  tract,  hematology  parameters  related  to 
hemoglobin and coagulation process, kidney (rat), liver (rat), reproductive organs and thymus and 
other lymphoid organs.  
Gastrointestinal System (GI) effects were observed in all  nonclinical species in toxicology studies. 
These effects limited the maximum dose administered in several repeat-dose studies. Vomiting and 
salivation were observed in both rats and dogs. Lymphoid atrophy in GI tract was observed in one 
female  dog  administered  10  mg/kg  eliglustat  for  28  days  and  in  a  male  in  the  recovery  group.  
Haemorrhage of cecum and colon was already observed in lowest dose treatment group in 13 weeks 
study in Beagle Dog. Animals treated with the highest dose in that same study had a decreased Ileum 
weight.  
Several  coagulation  and  hemoglobin  related  hematology  parameters  were  affected  in  rat 
administered mid and high doses  for 3 and 26 weeks, which was not noted in dog studies. Clinically 
no changes in hematology parameters were observed, therefore the observed changes in hemoglobin 
and coagulation related parameters in treated rats are unlikely to be clinical relevant.

In kidneys of rats dosed with 50 mg/kg eliglustat for 26 weeks renal pelvis dilation (1/14  female and 
1/14 male) was observed along with an increase in K levels in serum and a decrease in urinary pH. 
Rats dosed with 100 mg/kg eliglustat for 28 days had elevated Na (males), K, P and Cl levels in serum 
and a relatively higher weight of the kidneys was observed in recovery animals.  
In dogs, no clear difference regarding effect on kidneys were observed between treated animals and 
control animals. Clinically, elevation of serum electrolytes was not noted. A slight increase in urinary 
pH was observed in treated subjects. Since pre-clinical and clinical effects on kidney and secondary 
parameters are not in line, it is unlikely that above described effects are clinical relevant. 
An increase in liver weight (relative to body weight) and increased ALT levels were observed in rats 
treated with the highest dose eliglustat for 28 days. In recovery animals an increase in ALP level was 
observed. The effects were not seen in the 26 weeks study in rat and not in Beagle dogs treated with 
eliglustat.  The  liver  effects  are  of  a  lesser  severity  as  compared  to  a  compound  of  the  same 
pharmacological  class,  miglustat.  In  clinical  studies  slight  changes  in  enzyme  levels  are  noted, 
pointing towards a slight increase in liver activity, which is not unexpected.  
In female rats dosed with 50 mg/kg for 26 weeks the lumen of uterus was dilated and hyperkeratosis 
of the vagina was observed. Since this was only observed in one rat study this effect is likely not 
clinically relevant. In male beagle dogs dosed 10 mg/kg Eliglustat for 52 weeks a greater incidence of 
seminiferous  epithelial  degeneration  and  segmental  hypoplasia  of  the  testes  was  observed.  The 
exposure after dosing dogs with10 mg/kg for 52 weeks is 4460 ng.h/mL, which is 3.7 times higher the 
clinical AUC level.  
Lymphoid atrophy of the thymus and lymph nodes was observed in female dogs dosed ≥ 10 mg/kg 
Eliglustat  for  28  days,  which  seems  reversible.  This  effect  was  also  observed  in  male  recovery 
animals. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity  
In carcinogenicity studies in rat treatment with eliglustat did not prove to be carcinogenic at doses up 
to 75 mg/kg/day. The AUC values for the high dose after 13 weeks treatment are for male rats dosed 
75 mg/kg/day 1135 ng.h/mL and for female rats dosed 50 mg/kg/mL, 825 ng.h/mL. These exposure 
values are below clinically relevant exposures in an  intermediate metaboliser population. In mice, 
increases in benign cortical adenoma in the adrenal cortex in high dose males coincided with cortical 
hyperplasia. The tumour incidence was within historical control range. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
After 15 days at 100 mg/kg/day eliglustat there was a moderate to marked, subacute inflammation in 
coagulating glands of male rats. At higher, non-tolerable doses, a lower percentage of motile sperm 
occurred  and  the  percentage  of  morphologically  normal  sperm  was  lower.  The  morphological 
abnormality was mainly separation of the head from the flagellum. After 14 weeks, the values were 
similar to controls. Lower prostate weights, bilaterally atrophied coagulating glands, sloughed cells in 
the epididymis and acute inflammation of the coagulating glands were noted at ≥50 mg/kg BID. Germ 
cell necrosis in the testis, epithelial hyperplasia in the forestomach and severe complete atrophy of 
thymus and spleen showed at 100 mg/kg BID. All effects showed reversibility. The NOEL for effects on 
spermatogenesis and male reproductive organs also was 15 mg/kg BID, which is below the intended 
human  exposure.  A  non-GLP  study  in  4  cynomolgus  monkeys  showed  no  significant  effects  on 
spermatogenesis, however this study is deemed not suitable for risk assessment due to shortcomings 
in study design (no control group and only one dose group) and documentation.

In rats, 120 mg/kg/day eliglustat caused an increased number of late resorptions, dead foetuses, post 
implantation losses and lower foetal body weights. Also foetuses showed a higher incidence of dilated 
cerebral  ventricles,  abnormal  number  of  ribs  or  lumbar  vertebrae,  and  many  bones  showed  poor 
ossification. The NOEL for maternal toxicity in rats was 30 mg/kg/day and the NOEL for embryofetal 
development  in  rats  was  30  mg/kg/day,  without  a  safety  margin.  In  rabbits,  eliglustat  showed 
minimal  effects  in  females  at  30  mg/kg/day  (slight  decrease  in  body  weight  gain).  No  effects  on 
foetuses were seen at 100 mg/kg/day, also without a safety margin. In rats, the NOAEL for the F1 
generation was 100 mg/kg/day eliglustat, as the observed lower mean body weight and minimally 
lower  mean  body  weight  gains  did  not  affect  learning  and  memory,  locomotor  activity,  sexual 
development, mating or fertility. 
In juvenile toxicity studies, no major toxicity was observed. Two groups of animals (rats) were used 
to determine effects of eliglustat on toxicity parameters and on fertility parameters. Females used for 
the toxicity part of the study showed minimal delay in vaginal opening, but this was not significant in 
the females used for fertility evaluation. In prostate en epididymis an increase in inflammatory cell 
foci was found, which persisted during recovery phase for epididymis only. Other observed effects are 
in  line  with  observed  effects  in  adult  animals  in  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies.  Currently  this 
application concerns an adult population. For this patient group, these effects are not relevant. 
Metabolites and impurities 
The  disproportionate  human  metabolite  Genz-399240  was  found  not  genotoxic  and  not  toxic  in  a 
repeat-dose  study  up  to  6  mg/kg/day,  which  corresponds  to  ca.  8  times  the  intended  human 
exposure. 
Impurities Genz-256146 and Genz-684453 have been detected as potential mutagenic substances. 
However,  both  impurities  have  been  tested  with  a  bacterial  reverse  mutation  assay  and  found 
negative.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics and secondary pharmacology 
Eliglustat showed a high potency and efficacy in a number of in vitro cell systems. In an in vivo mouse 
Gaucher disease model, eliglustat reduced GL-1 levels up to 80% in liver, lung and spleen. A few 
secondary  target  receptors,  like  dopamine  and  serotonin  receptors,  might  be  affected  at  high 
concentrations  of  eliglustat  in  the  gut.    However,  the  use  of  GL-1  as  a  biomarker  in  plasma  of 
non-clinical species was questioned, but since a clinical dose dependent reduction of plasma GL-1 was 
demonstrated, further discussion was not considered necessary by the CHMP.  
Safety pharmacology 
Eliglustat showed no effects on CNS parameters in rats. A reversible decrease in respiratory rate was 
seen in rats treated with 400 mg/kg. Effects were also seen in the renal study at this dose, namely a 
reversible increase in urine pH, and a decrease in potassium and chloride urinary excretion. The poor 
status of the animals due to dosing above the MTD was the likely cause of these effects in the opinion 
of the CHMP. Cmax values in these animals are likely to be much higher than clinical Cmax values, and 
therefore clinical relevance is unlikely. 
Severe effects on gastrointestinal transit in rats are probably caused by high local concentrations of 
eliglustat.  
In dogs, eliglustat caused several cardiovascular effects. These are likely to be the result of a block in 
cardiac sodium channels, possibly in combination with inhibition of the Ikr current that may lead to 
changes in ECG and cardiac conduction at concentrations that appear to be above clinical Cmax values. 
However, in the clinical trials, problems with cardiac output in combination with bradycardia have 
been  observed,  whereas  a  thorough  QT  study  in  healthy  volunteers  (GZGD01707)  did  not  reveal 
clinically relevant prolongations of QT in plasma levels below the 500 ng/ml. Based on the analysis of 
clinical data a causal relation of bradycardia/cardiac output and eliglustat could not be established. 
The pre-clinical results might be of relevance for human safety. Differences in active concentrations 
might be due to the difference in protein binding of eliglustat between pre-clinical species and humans. 
The cardiovascular effects are further discussed in the clinical part of the AR. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
Eliglustat is a highly permeable drug and is rapidly absorbed and the high volumes of distribution 
across the non-clinical species indicate extensive tissue distribution. However, at clinically relevant 
concentrations, the free fraction of eliglustat is significant lower in the non-clinical species than in 
humans. This has consequences for the interpretation of the toxicity safety margins. 
Eliglustat is extensively metabolised and in a different manner between species. All circulating human 
metabolites are observed in at least one of the non-clinical species, but the systemic exposure of 
some of these metabolites appears to be very low in the respective species compared to humans. The 
human  systemic  exposure  to  the  major  metabolite,  M24,  is  not  achieved  via  repeated  oral 
administration  in  the  non-clinical  species  at  the  NOAEL  dose.  Therefore,  M24  has  been  tested 
separately in 13-week rat study and genotoxicity studies, with an exposure margin of 3-4. All other 
metabolites are less than  10% of total drug related exposures and  further characterization of the 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 22/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metabolites is not considered necessary. As metabolite Genz-399240 (M24) does not contribute to 
pharmacological  activity  and  does  not  exhibit  major  off-target  effects,  characterization  of  its 
transporter substrate specificity was considered not warranted. 
Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity studies 
Acute  doses  of  eliglustat  above  clinically  relevant  concentrations  are  well  tolerated  in  animals. 
Gastrointestinal  System  (GI)  effects  were  observed  in  all  nonclinical  species  in  the  repeat  dose 
studies. This effect however, appears to be less relevant for humans, as little or no GI-tract adverse 
effects were seen in the clinical trials. Effects on reproduction organs and spermatogenesis are also 
seen at high doses in carcinogenicity studies and reproduction toxicity studies. These effects were 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. Lymphoid atrophy of the thymus and lymph nodes seen in dogs 
after  4  weeks  was  not  apparent  in  the  13  weeks  and  52  weeks  studies,  which  could  indicate  an 
adaptive response after chronic dosing. As is stated by the applicant, it cannot be ruled out that the 
observed  effect  in  thymus  is  treatment  related.  However,  as  there  appears  to  be  no  symptoms 
observed in clinical trials that could be related to lymphoid depletion, and the thymus has no major 
role in an adult human, it is unlikely that lymphoid depletion has any clinical consequence.  
Several differences in the ADME of eliglustat exist among the pre-clinical species and between the 
preclinical species and humans. Important is the difference in free fraction between the preclinical 
species and humans. When this is taken into account, the margins of safety are non-existent. The 
safety margins, including the free fraction related ones, have been adequately presented in the SmpC. 
This  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  when  evaluating  safety  of  eliglustat  from  clinical  development 
program.  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
In the mouse carcinogenicity study, the plasma levels after 13 weeks of dosing were generally below 
the limit of quantification. The applicant has attempted to demonstrate drug exposure by measuring 
plasma GL-1 levels. Although these levels are slightly lower in the dosed groups as compared to the 
controls, the difference is marginal and there is no  dose response. Overall, drug exposure can be 
assumed to be very low in the mouse carcinogenicity study, and is low in the rat study.  Dose levels 
for both studies were based on adverse effects seen in other studies, and it was agreed that higher 
doses were not appropriate. Therefore, it must be concluded that the relevance of the studies is low, 
but the risk of a carcinogenic effect of eliglustat is also low considering all the available data. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Some effects of eliglustat on testes and spermatogenesis were seen in rats during repeat dose and 
reproductive toxicity studies. Also, minor effects on fetuses of rats were seen at maternal toxic, but 
clinically relevant doses of eliglustat. Dilated brain ventricles were noted in rats at the high dose, and 
in rabbits but limited to foetuses of the mid dose group and not observed in foetuses of the high dose 
group.  
Regarding juvenile toxicity, persistence inflammatory cell foci in the epididymis were seen after the 
recovery period in juvenile animals. It is recommended the juvenile toxicity to be discussed at the 
time of a potential future indication for children. 
Metabolites and impurities

No additional toxicities of metabolites or impurities have been found. Metabolite Genz-399240 (M24) 
and impurities Genz-256146 and Genz-684453 are found not genotoxic. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that Cerdelga is a potent 
and specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase. From the pharmacokinetic point of view, the main 
findings  were  the  differences  in  metabolite  forming  and  protein  binding  in  all  species,  including 
humans. The toxicology programme revealed susceptibility of GI-tract, cardiovascular system and 
reproductive  organs  where  relevance  for  humans  cannot  be  excluded.  This  information  has  been 
included in the agreed SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Each capsule contains 84.4 mg eliglustat free base (equivalent to 100 mg of eliglustat tartrate). The 
doses  mentioned  in  this  part  of  the  dossier  are  declared  as  tartrate.  The  clinical  development 
programme  for  eliglustat  presented  in  this  application  consists  of  13  Phase  1  studies  (including 
multiple drug-drug interaction studies, because of eliglustat’s extensive metabolism via CYP450 liver 
enzymes), one Phase 2 study (GZGD00304), two controlled Phase 3 pivotal studies (ENGAGE [Study 
GZGD02507]  and  ENCORE  [Study  GZGD02607]),  and  one  Phase  3b  study  (EDGE  [Study 
GZGD03109]).  
The Phase 2 study and Phase 3 studies: ENGAGE, and ENCORE, which have completed their primary 
analysis periods (PAPs) but have ongoing long-term treatment periods, provide efficacy and safety 
data in support of the marketing authorization applications for GD1, while the ongoing Phase 3b study 
(EDGE) provides additional safety data. These studies are listed below: 
•  GZGD00304:  A  Phase  2,  Open-Label,  Multi-Center  Study  Evaluating  the  Efficacy,  Safety  and 
Pharmacokinetics of Genz-112638 in Gaucher Type 1 Patients 
•  GZGD02507:  A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled,  Multi-Center  Study 
Confirming  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Genz-112638  in  Patients  with  Gaucher  Disease  Type  1 
(ENGAGE) 
•  GZGD02607:  A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Multi-Center,  Multi-National,  Open-Label,  Active 
Comparator  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Genz-112638  in  Patients  with  Gaucher 
Disease Type 1 who have Reached Therapeutic Goals with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ENCORE) 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
FDA GCP inspections were conducted in the period December 2013 to March 2014 (for the two clinical 
studies  GZGD02607  and  GZGD02507).  Further,  an  inspection  of  the  sponsor  was  conducted.  No 
critical or major violations were noted, only minor regulatory issues. The studies appear to have been 
conducted adequately and the data generated by these studies appear acceptable in support of the 
respective indications.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Thirteen  studies in  healthy  subjects  and  3  studies in  GD1  patients  were  submitted  to  support  the 
pharmacokinetics of eliglustat. A total of 291 healthy subjects and 343 GD1 patients were included in 
these studies. In addition, 22 reports covering in vitro data and 6 reports with simulation data are 
submitted.  
Genotyping for CYP2D6 allelic variants classified patients into one of 4 CYP2D6 phenotypes (PM, IM, 
EM, or URM).  
Solubility data showed that eliglustat has a solubility of about 200 mg/ml at pH 1.0 and 4.5, which 
decreased  at  higher  pH,  however  remained  above  2  mg/ml.  Considering  the  maximal  indicated 
recommended dose in the SmPC of 100 mg BID, eliglustat is a highly soluble drug. Although the data 
indicate  that  eliglustat  seems  to  be  completely  absorbed,  metabolic  profiling  of  eliglustat  and  its 
metabolites in faeces is lacking. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the whole administered dose 
is absorbed and that the recovery of labelled drug in faeces is absorbed drug which is excreted back 
into the GI-tract as metabolites. Therefore, eliglustat should conservatively be considered a BCS Class 
III drug, i.e. high solubility and low permeability (<85% absorbed). 
Analytical methods 
In principle, one analytical LC-MS/MS method has been applied for the analysis of eliglustat in plasma, 
as clean-up procedures were almost identical. Validation proved that the method was specific, precise 
and  accurate.  Stability  was  shown  covering  study  sample  handling  and  storage.  Transferring  the 
method  to  2  other  analytical  laboratories  did  not  affect  accuracy  and  precision,  as  proven  by 
cross-over validation. 
Also for the analysis of eliglustat in urine, validation showed that the method was precise and accurate 
and stability was sufficiently shown over the sampling and storage conditions.  
Absorption  
After oral administration, maximum eliglustat plasma concentrations are observed after about 2 h. 
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  eliglustat  is  4.49%  ±  4.13%.  A  high  fat,  high  caloric  meal  delayed 
absorption of eliglustat by about 1 h, resulting in a 15% lower Cmax. The extent of absorption (AUC) 
was  not  affected.  Food  has  no  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  eliglustat  and 
eliglustat can be taken with or without food, as recommended in the SmPC. 
Two  capsule  formulations  have  been  used  in  the  clinical  studies,  i.e.  capsules  with  a  high  load  of 
microcrystalline cellulose (about 39%) and a low load (about 15 – 17%).  Bioequivalence has been 
demonstrated between these two capsule formulations. Considering the qualitative and quantitative 
composition  of  the  Phase  1b,  2  and  3  formulations,  the  dissolution  data  and  the  results  of  the 
bioequivalence  study,  no  significant  differences 
in  pharmacokinetics  are  expected  after 
administration of these formulations. 
Although  in  healthy  subjects  a  more than  dose  proportional  increase  was  observed  over  the  dose 
range of 50 – 150 mg BID (6-fold increase), GD1 patients showed a proportional increase, possibly 
related  to  a  difference  in  Vc  and  Cl  in  GD1  patients  compared  to  healthy  subjects.  However,  as 
eliglustat tartrate is dosed at one dose level i.e. 100 mg BID in IM and EM patients and 100 mg QD in 
PM patients, this issue is not further pursued as considered not relevant. 
Despite  its  short  half-life  of  eliglustat,  an  approximately  3-fold  accumulation  is  observed. 
Furthermore, steady state is achieved at about day 4. This is considered due to an increase in oral 
bioavailability after chronic dosing due to auto-inhibition of its CYP2D6 mediated metabolism. 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 28/75 
 
 
 
 
Steady  state  for  the  metabolites  appeared  to  be  achieved  within  10  days  of  dosing.  A  similar 
accumulation was observed for some metabolites.  
GD1 patients had almost a 1.7-fold higher exposure compared to healthy subjects.  A starting dose of 
50 mg b.i.d. was selected for the Phase 2 study based in part on pharmacokinetic data in healthy 
subjects showing that eliglustat maximum observed Cmax was at or near the in vitro half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) for glucosylceramide synthase inhibition (approximately 10 ng/ml). In 
later studies the target was a Ctrough concentration > 5 ng/ml and a Cmax <150 ng/ml. The patient’s 
dose therefore varied from 50 mg once daily to 150 mg BID. A 100 mg b.i.d. dose to CYP2D6 IM and 
EM patients was considered the recommended (SPC) dose as mean trough values were >5 ng/ml, and 
only a few maximal concentrations were observed >150 ng/ml. It is noted that a high variability is 
observed in the trough values. Applying this dose resulted in acceptable efficacy and safety.  
With regard to the CYP2D6 URM subjects, PBPK simulated data predicted that even at a dose of 150 
mg  b.i.d.,  at  12  h  trough  values  above  5  ng/ml  were  not  reached.  However,  eliglustat  plasma 
concentrations above 5 ng/ml were achieved over the dose-interval, from which patients may benefit. 
Only limited data were obtained in URM patients, therefore no dose recommendation is given. Based 
upon PBPK simulation data, a 100 mg q.d. dose in PM patients is predicted to result in comparable 
daily  exposures  that  were  observed  in  the  clinical  development  program  in  IM  and  EM  patients. 
Although limited data in PM patients is available, a 100 mg q.d. dose is recommended for PM patients. 
Further data will be obtained post-authorisation in URM and PM groups to further substantiate a dose 
recommendation. 
Eliglustat pharmacokinetics shows a high between-subject variability of about 50 – 75%. This high 
variability can be considered due to the metabolism, which is CYP2D6 dependent, an enzyme known 
to  be  subject  to  polymorphism.  However,  intra-subject  variability  was  shown  to  be  below  30% in 
CYP2D6 EM subjects. 
Distribution 
Eliglustat  is  moderately  bound  to  plasma  proteins  and  drug-drug  interactions  due  to  protein 
displacement  are  not  expected  with  eliglustat.    Based  upon  animal  data,  eliglustat  is  widely 
distributed to body tissues and it may cross the blood-brain barrier. 
Metabolism 
Eliglustat is extensively metabolised and twenty-one metabolites were identified in plasma. Oxidation 
of the octanoyl moiety, oxidation at the 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxane moiety and the metabolism of 
the pyrrolidine moiety are considered the metabolic pathways. Eliglustat is a substrate of CYP2D6, a 
cytochrome P450 isoform that is genetically controlled. CYP2D6 is, the main enzyme involved in the 
metabolism.  In  addition,  CYP3A4  contributes  to  a  minor  part,  however  this  metabolic  pathway 
becomes the prominent pathway in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (hence patients who are CYP2D6 PMs 
taking  a  strong  CYP3A  inhibitor  are  contraindicated  in  the  SmPC).  CYP2D6  is  also  involved  in  the 
metabolism of several metabolites. Plasma exposure of several structurally identified metabolites was 
significantly higher than parent compound. Still, due to the lower affinity of these metabolites, these 
metabolites do not contribute to the pharmacological activity of eliglustat. 
Elimination 
The plasma elimination half-life of eliglustat is about 6 h in CYP2D6 IM and EM subjects and increased 
in  CYP2D6  PM  subjects  (9-10h).  GD1  patients  showed  a  higher  clearance  compared  to  healthy 
subjects, possibly due to an altered metabolism as a result of the disease state. CL/F at steady state 
in GD1 patients was about 700 - 800 l/h. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated a clearance of 
about 56 l/h. Cl/F was lower at steady state compared to single dose and lower in CYP2D6 PM subjects 
compared  to  IM  and  EM  subjects.  Mean  recovery  of  total  radioactivity  in  urine  was  41.8%  and  in 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 29/75 
 
 
 
 
faeces 51.4% (total recovery 93.2%). Total combined recovery of unchanged eliglustat in urine and 
faeces  was  less  than  1%.  Additional  metabolites  were  identified  in  urine,  however,  the  urine 
metabolite  profile  of  eliglustat  is  considered  consistent  with  that  observed  in  systemic  circulation. 
Metabolite profiling was not carried out in faeces samples. The elimination of about 50% of the drug 
is  not  well  characterised  in  humans,  however  it  is  considered that  eliglustat  is  well  absorbed,  the 
metabolic  profile  in  plasma  is  well  established  and  in  line  with  in  vitro  data,  so  no  unexpected 
metabolites are foreseen in faeces. 
Special patient groups 
PopPK  modelling  included  only  the  405  subjects  /  patients  with  a  known  CYP2D6  phenotype.  The 
PopPK analysis indicated that the absolute bioavailability was predicted to be approximately 20 times 
greater for CYP2D6 PMs compared with CYP2D6 EMs. In addition, after repeated 100 mg b.i.d. doses, 
Cmax and AUC0-12 in CYP2D6 PMs were 10-fold higher compared to CYP2D6 EMs, while Cmax and AUC0-12 
in CYP2D6 IMs were about ~2.8-fold higher than CYP2D6 EMs and Cmax and AUC0-12 in CYP2D6 URMs 
were 46% lower than CYP2D6 EMs. T1/2 was similar for CYP2D6 IMs, EMs and URMs and was 1.2-fold 
higher in CYP2D6 PMs. For PM subjects a lower dose is recommended, i.e. 100 mg q.d..  
After multiple dosing, based upon population pharmacokinetic analysis no effect of gender, age, body 
weight and race on the clearance of eliglustat is observed.  
No data were submitted regarding evaluation of pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment. Therefore, the SmPC states only that Cerdelga has not been studied in patients with 
hepatic or renal impairment. Post approval studies are planned in these groups of patients, and the 
results will be submitted for the assessment.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Eliglustat is a substrate of CYP2D6, 3A4 and P-gp, which may be affected by inhibition of induction. No 
induction has been observed by eliglustat. Inhibition of CYP2D6 (time-dependent, Ki 5.8 μM (2350 
ng/ml) and P-gp (22 μM (8900 ng/ml) by eliglustat may be expected. Eliglustat is considered not to 
inhibit CYP3A4 in the intestine. 
In vivo studies confirmed the interaction potential of eliglustat: 
• 
• 
• 
Inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine (30 mg q.d.) resulted in a 7.3-fold increase in Cmax and in a 
8.9-fold increase in AUC0-12h of eliglustat in non-PM healthy subjects receiving 100 mg b.i.d. eliglustat. 
Use of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine) with Cerdelga is not 
recommended.  
Inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp by ketoconazole (400 mg q.d.) resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in Cmax 
and in a 4.3-fold increase in AUC0-12h of eliglustat in healthy non-PM subjects receiving 100 mg b.i.d. 
eliglustat. Caution is advised in case of use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, which is agreed. 
Induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp by rifampin (600 mg q.d.) resulted in a 95% decrease in Cmax and in a 
96% decrease in AUC0-12h of eliglustat in healthy PM subjects receiving 100 mg b.i.d. eliglustat and in 
a 84% decrease in Cmax and 85% decrease in AUC0-12h of eliglustat in healthy non-PM subjects 
receiving 150 mg b.i.d. eliglustat. Use of strong inducers is not recommended. 
•  No effect on the pharmacokinetics of eliglustat was observed due to pH modifying drugs (Maalox, 
calcium carbonate and pantoprazole).  
• 
• 
Inhibition of P-gp by eliglustat (150 mg b.i.d. non-PM and 100 mg b.i.d. PM) resulted in a 50% 
increase in digoxin exposure (0.25 mg single dose). This may warrant a lower dose of digoxin, 
as indicated in the SmPC. 
Inhibition of CYP2D6 by eliglustat (150 mg b.i.d. non-PM) resulted in a 110% increase in 
metoprolol exposure (50 mg single dose). For EM the effect was more pronounced that for IM 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 30/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(130% increase) compared with IMs (60% increase). This may warrant a lower dose, as 
indicated in the SmPC. 
• 
Eliglustat (100 mg b.i.d.) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone or ethinyl estradiol 
(Ortho-Novum 1/35, given as the standard cycle). 
These interactions have been adequately described in the SmPC. 
Additional  simulations  using  Physiologically-Based  Pharmacokinetic  Modelling  with  SimCYP®  were 
carried  out  to  cover  additional  interactions.  The  model  was  validated  using  the  data  from  the 
interaction studies with paroxetine and ketoconazole and showed good estimates of the effect.  
Based upon these simulations, it is predicted that inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may increase 
eliglustat  Cmax  and  AUC  by  17-  and  25-fold,  respectively.  Based  upon  these  data,  Cerdelga  is 
contraindicated in patients taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a strong 
or moderate CYP3A inhibitor, which is agreed. Furthermore, in PM patients receiving a 100 mg q.d. 
dose it was predicted that a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor would increase eliglustat exposure by more than 
6-fold. As such, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are contraindicated in PM subjects. 
Moderate  CYP2D6  inhibitors,  like  terbinafine,  would  increase  eliglustat  exposure  approximately 
4-fold. Therefore, caution is advised in the SmPC.  
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, like fluconazole, would increase eliglustat exposure approximately 
3-fold. Therefore, Caution is advised in the SmPC which is agreed. For PM subjects receiving a 100 mg 
q.d. dose, moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are predicted to increase exposure by 3-fold. Very limited data 
is available for this patient group and the use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Although  in  healthy  subjects  a  more than  dose  proportional  increase  was  observed  over  the  dose 
range  of  50  –  150  mg  b.i.d.,  GD1  patients  showed  a  proportional  increase,  possibly  related  to  a 
difference in Vc and Cl in GD1 patients.  As eliglustat tartrate is dosed at one dose level i.e. 100 mg 
b.i.d (100 mg q.d. for PM), this issue is not further pursued. Despite its short half-life of eliglustat, an 
approximately 3-fold accumulation is observed. Furthermore, steady state is achieved at about day 4. 
This is considered due to an increase in oral bioavailability after chronic dosing due to auto-inhibition 
of its metabolism. Steady state for the metabolites appeared to be achieved within 10 days of dosing. 
A similar accumulation was observed for some metabolites. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Eliglustat  is  a  potent  and  specific  inhibitor  of  glucosylceramide  synthase,  and  acts  as  a  substrate 
reduction therapy (SRT) for GD1. SRT aims to reduce the rate of synthesis of the major substrate 
glucosylceramide  (GL-1)  to  match  its  impaired  rate  of  catabolism  in  patients  with  GD1,  thereby 
preventing glucosylceramide accumulation and alleviating clinical manifestations. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Several biomarkers (GL-1, GM3, ceramide, sphingomyelin) related to the pharmacological activity of 
eliglustat were evaluated throughout the clinical program in GD1 patients, and the results support 
that  eliglustat  has  its  intended  biological  effect  as  an  SRT  without  causing  abnormal  depletion  or 
accumulation of other physiologically relevant lipids. 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 31/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Plasma levels of GL-1 and GM3 (a downstream ganglioside derived from GL-1), which are typically 
elevated  in  GD1  patients,  were  significantly  reduced  following  repeated  oral  administration  of 
eliglustat 50 mg to 150 mg BID, consistent with inhibition of GL-1 synthesis. Moreover, a majority of 
patients achieved normal levels of these biomarkers by the end of the primary analysis period of each 
study.  The  maintenance  of  normal  to  near-normal  GM3  levels  further  indicates  that  inhibition  of 
glucosylceramide  synthase  by  eliglustat  is  unlikely  to  cause  abnormal  depletion  of  physiologically 
important lipids in the GL-1-dependent synthetic pathway. 
Plasma levels of ceramide, which are typically normal in GD1 patients, did not change significantly 
with repeated dosing of eliglustat 50 mg to 150 mg BID, and were normal for all patients in Phase 2 
and ENGAGE study and normal or not clinically significant for all patients in ENCORE study at the end 
of  the  respective  primary  analysis  periods.  Plasma  sphingomyelin  levels,  which  are  also  typically 
normal in GD1 patients, increased during eliglustat treatment but remained below the upper limit of 
normal in all patients at the end of the primary analysis periods of each study. These results indicate 
that inhibition of GL-1 synthesis by eliglustat is unlikely to cause an abnormal accumulation of either 
the precursor substrate of GL-1 synthesis (ceramide) or physiologically important lipids synthesized 
from ceramide via GL-1-independent pathways. 
In treatment-naïve patients who received eliglustat, large median reductions in chitotriosidase were 
noted in both ENGAGE study and the Phase 2 study, with all patients exhibiting reductions by the end 
of  the  primary  analysis  periods  (PAP),  while  in  patients  in  the  ENCORE  study,  smaller  median 
reductions in chitotriosidase were seen in both treatment arms, with some individual patients having 
increases  and  others  having  decreases.  The  median  percentage  reductions  in  chitotriosidase  that 
occurred in treatment-naïve patients (-39.06% [mean -39.20%; see ENGAGE CSR] at the end of the 
9-month  ENGAGE  PAP  and  -51.3%  [mean  -49.9%;  see  Phase  2  Study  CSR]  at  the  end  of  the 
12-month Phase 2 study PAP) are comparable to reductions seen with ERT, where the mean decrease 
in 12 months was 32% (range, 0–82%) and 78% of patients had a decrease of more than 15%. The 
reductions of the various biomarkers were dose depended with effects demonstrated for the lowest 
plasma levels (<5 ng/ml). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analysis  of  the  exposure-response  relationship  between  eliglustat  PK  and  key  clinical  outcomes 
suggested that CYP2D6 IMs and EMs receiving eliglustat 100 mg BID would be expected to achieve an 
eliglustat exposure within the range observed to provide efficacy and acceptable safety. Moreover 
clinical relevant effects are observed at all dose levels. Therefore the cut-off for efficacy defined as 
Ctrough levels above 5 ng/ml should be considered relative, i.e. meaningful differences can be obtained 
with Ctrough levels below 5 ng/ml. Further analysis of the applicant showed that no lower threshold for 
efficacy could be defined. Although a more general relation between plasma concentration and effect 
on PD measures (i.e. spleen volume) can be identified it should be concluded that the practical range 
is rather broad.  
Eliglustat treatment resulted in significantly decreased plasma levels of GL-1 and GM3, consistent 
with  its  mechanism  of  action,  and  did  not  result  in  abnormal  accumulation  of  either  ceramide  or 
sphingomyelin, confirming that inhibition of GL-1 synthesis by eliglustat did not result in abnormal 
accumulation of either the substrate from which GL-1 is derived (ceramide) or another sphingolipid 
synthesised  from  ceramide  and  phosphorylcholine  via  a  GL-1-independent  synthetic  pathway 
(sphingomyelin).  
Additional analysis of the applicant showed that the plasma concentration of sphingomyelin increased 
from low normal levels to high normal levels. This combined with the reports of neuropathy and the 
important role these lipids play in signal conduction may introduce a safety concern. However as an 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 32/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase in sphingolipids is also observed in patients on ERT no serious or acute safety risk is to be 
expected. Long term follow-up was considered necessary by the CHMP and this is reflected in the 
agreed RMP.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  eliglustat  has  been  studied  extensively.  All  aspects  have  been  sufficient 
covered. No major issues have been identified. The CHMP recommended that two analytical reports 
for  studies  GZGD02507  and  GZGD02607  should  be  provided  post-authorisation  when  completed. 
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic or renal impairment will be carried out post approval 
and the results submitted in Q3 2017. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Overall,  the  improvements  in  biomarkers  of  substrate  storage,  macrophage  proliferation,  and 
Gaucher  cell  burden  provides  additional  pathophysiological  support  demonstrating  that  eliglustat 
treatment is exerting its intended biological effect as an SRT for GD1, and support the improvements 
observed in organ volume (liver and spleen), haematologic parameters (haemoglobin and platelets), 
and skeletal imaging (BMD and bone marrow infiltration). 
Long term follow-up of the plasma sphingolipids level is necessary. The relation with the reported 
neuropathy should be determined. Neuropathy has currently been included in the agreed RMP as an 
important potential risk. Long term safety  (including peripheral neuropathy) will be followed-up in the 
extension  studies  GZGD00304,  GZGD02507,  GZGD02607,  GZGD03109  that  were  included  in  the 
agreed RMP. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development programme for eliglustat presented in this application consisted of 13 Phase 
1  studies  (including  multiple  drug-drug  interaction  studies,  because  of  eliglustat’s  extensive 
metabolism via CYP450 liver enzymes), one Phase 2 study (GZGD00304), two Phase 3 pivotal studies 
(ENGAGE [Study GZGD02507] and ENCORE [Study GZGD02607]), and one Phase 3b study (EDGE 
[Study  GZGD03109]).  The  Phase  2  study,  ENGAGE,  and  ENCORE,  which  have  completed  their 
primary analysis periods (PAPs) but have ongoing long-term treatment periods, provide efficacy and 
safety data in support of the marketing authorization applications for GD1, while the ongoing Phase 
3b study (EDGE) provides additional safety data. These studies are listed below:

The  eliglustat  programme  is  the  largest  clinical  development  programme  conducted  to  date  in 
Gaucher disease, with almost 400 patients enrolled, in an ultra-orphan population. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies  
No specific dose finding studies were performed. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  efficacy  data  were  collected  in  two  studies  in  treatment-naïve  patients  with  GD1  (a  1:1 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study [Study GZGD02507, ENGAGE] and an 
open-label,  long-term  Phase  2  study  [Study  GZGD00304]),  and  a  2:1  randomised,  open-label, 
non-inferiority,  active-control  Phase  3  study  in  patients  switching  from  ERT  [Study  GZGD02607, 
ENCORE]).  
Each of the studies providing efficacy information for the application consists of a screening period, a 
dose-adjustment period for those receiving eliglustat (allowing doses up to 100 mg BID during the 
PAP for Phase 2 and ENGAGE and doses up to 150 mg BID in ENCORE), a primary analysis period 
(PAP; 39 weeks for ENGAGE and 52 weeks for the Phase 2 study and ENCORE), and an open-label 
long-term treatment period during which those patients initially assigned to the control treatment in 
ENGAGE and ENCORE can receive eliglustat and patients initially assigned to eliglustat treatment can 
continue to receive eliglustat. 
In the Phase 2 study (Study GZGD00304) treatment was started with 50 mg BID, if a patient’s PK 
results at Day 10 (to ensure steady-state) indicated the Ctrough of Genz-99067 was <5 ng/mL, the 
patient’s dose was increased to 100 mg BID starting on Day 20 and then maintained at that dose level 
through the remainder of the PAP. If the Ctrough value was ≥5 ng/mL, the patient remained on 50 mg 
BID for the remainder of the PAP.  
In the PAP of the two pivotal Phase 3 studies, ENGAGE and ENCORE, dosing also started at eliglustat 
50 mg BID. At Week 4, patients randomised to eliglustat could have their dose titrated up to 100 mg 
BID if the patient’s Genz-99067 Ctrough was <5 ng/mL at Week 2. In ENCORE, but not ENGAGE, if the 
patient’s Ctrough remained at <5 ng/mL at Week 6, dosing could be titrated up further to 150 mg BID 
at Week 8. 
The primary endpoint of ENGAGE trial was the percentage change in spleen  volume (in MN)  from 
Baseline to 39 weeks of treatment with eliglustat as compared to placebo. In the Phase 2 study, the 
primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients demonstrating a meaningful clinical response 
to eliglustat, as defined by pre-specified, objective improvements in 2 or more of the 3 main efficacy 
parameters (haemoglobin level increase ≥0.5 g/dL, platelet count increase ≥15%, and spleen volume 
reduction ≥15% in MN) from Baseline to Week 52 in values that were abnormal at Baseline for each 
patient. 
ENCORE was designed to evaluate whether the percentage of patients who maintained stability after 
switching  from  ERT  to  eliglustat  treatment  was  non-inferior  to  the  percentage  of  patients  who 
maintained  stability  when  continued  on  imiglucerase  treatment  after  52  weeks  of  treatment.  The 
criteria for maintaining stability for the primary efficacy analysis in ENCORE required that a patient be 
stable in all 4 domains of a composite endpoint, including 2 haematologic parameters (haemoglobin 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015

level does not decrease >1.5 g/dL from Baseline and platelet count does not decrease >25% from 
Baseline)  and  2  organ  volume  measures  (spleen  volume  [in  MN]  does  not  increase  >25%  from 
Baseline [in patients who have not had total splenectomy], and liver volume [in MN] does not increase 
>20%  from  Baseline).  A  non-inferiority  margin  of  25%  was  selected  for  this  study  based  on 
considerations of an imiglucerase response rate of 95% for the defined composite primary endpoint 
for measuring stability, and assuming a response rate of 85% for eliglustat based on Phase 2 data. In 
the EMA advice it was advised to set the non-inferiority margin at 20%.  
Study GZD02507 
A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multi- Center Study Confirming 
the Efficacy and Safety of Genz-112638 in Patients with Gaucher Disease Type 1 
(ENGAGE) 
Methods 
This  multi-center,  multinational  Phase  3  study  comprised  a  screening  period  (Days  -45  to  -1),  a 
randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  Primary  Analysis  Period  (Day  1  to  Week  39),  an 
open-label Long-term Treatment Period (post-Week 39 through study completion), and a follow-up 
phone call approximately 30 to 37 days after the last dose of study medication. Patients who met all 
eligibility  criteria  based  on  Screening  assessments  were  randomized  to  receive  treatment  with 
eliglustat or placebo during the 39-week Primary Analysis Period. Randomization was stratified based 
on the patient's Baseline spleen volume (≤20 multiples of normal [MN] or >20 MN), and within each 
stratum patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to each treatment group. All patients randomized to 
eliglustat received a single 50-mg dose on Day 1 and repeat doses of 50 mg twice daily (BID) from 
Day 2 to Week 4; thereafter, patients received a dose of either 50 or 100 mg BID through Week 39, 
depending on a patient's trough plasma concentration of eliglustat at Week 2. 
Patients entered the Long-term Treatment Period following completion of their Week 39 assessments. 
In this period, all patients received eliglustat at an initial dose of 50 mg BID from post-Week 39 (Day 
1 of the Long-term Treatment Period) through Week 43. Thereafter, patients received a dose of 50 or 
100 mg BID through Week 47 and a dose of 50, 100, or 150 mg BID from post-Week 47 through study 
completion, depending on their trough plasma concentration of eliglustat at Week 41 and Week 45, 
respectively.  The  Long-term  Treatment  Period  is  ongoing;  each  patient  may  continue  to  receive 
treatment for a total duration of up to 6 years. 
These analyses include safety, efficacy, and PK data collected through Week 39 for all patients, as well 
as  selected  efficacy  data  collected  during  the  initial  39  weeks  of  open-label  eliglustat  therapy  for 
patients who were originally randomized to placebo and completed the Week 78 visit as of the data 
cutoff date of 18 July 2012. 
Study Participants  
Patients met all protocol-defined eligibility criteria, including (but not limited to) the following key 
criteria: 
•  Age ≥16 years at the time of randomization. 
• 
Tanner Stage ≥4 prior to randomization. 
•  Diagnosis of GD1 confirmed by a documented deficiency of acid β-glucosidase activity by 
enzyme assay. 
•  Symptoms of Gaucher disease present during the Screening period, including:

•  Splenomegaly, defined as a spleen volume of 6 to 30 MN. 
• 
If hepatomegaly was present, liver volume <2.5 MN. 
•  Consented to provide a blood sample for genotyping for Gaucher disease, chitotriosidase, and 
CYP2D6, if these genotyping results were not already available. 
•  No treatment with substrate reduction therapy within 6 months prior to randomization or 
enzyme replacement therapy within 9 months prior to randomization. 
Investigational products 
•  No treatment with any of the following medications within 30 days prior to randomization: 
• 
•  Medications that may cause QTc interval prolongation 
• 
•  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, if the patient was a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer or an 
Inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 
indeterminate metabolizer with neither allele known to be active. 
•  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6, if the patient was not a CYP2D6 poor or indeterminate 
metabolizer, except where a patient had chronically received either medication (but not both) 
for at least 30 days prior to randomization and was continuing the same dosing regimen 
during the primary analysis period of this study. 
•  No history of splenectomy (partial or total), no evidence of neurologic or pulmonary 
involvement related to Gaucher disease, and no current symptomatic bone disease and no 
bone crises within 12 months prior to randomization. 
• 
The patient was not transfusion-dependent, and did not have anemia from causes other than 
Gaucher disease that was untreated or not stabilized on treatment within 3 months prior to 
randomization. 
•  No documented prior esophageal varices or liver infarction, and no current results for alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin >2 times the 
upper limit of normal, unless the patient had a diagnosis of Gilbert Syndrome. 
The included patient population is comparable with the population intended to be treated. The in- and 
exclusion  criteria  are  typical  for  studies  evaluating  the  effects  on  patients  suffering  from  Gaucher 
disease.

Patients were treated with doses ranging from 100mg to 300mg daily. Dose will be titrated based on 
the Ctrough as found after at least 2 weeks of treatment. The lower limit (5 ng/ml)is based on the IC50 
for GL-1 inhibition as demonstrated in the in vitro studies. The upper limit of 150 ng/ml is based on 
available safety data from Phase 3 studies. This information indicates a higher-than-expected level of 
exposure in certain patients; these patients may benefit from lower doses of eliglustat; therefore, if a 
post-dose plasma level of Genz-99067 ≥150 ng/mL is seen, a provision is included in the protocol for 
dose reduction (the lowest dose allowed in the study was 50 mg once daily (QD)). On other places the 
applicant argues that there are safety issues to be expected above the 150 ng/ml. In hindsight this 
upper limit of safety was based on preliminary data and over-concerned concern for patient safety. 
Patients  received  treatment  for  39  weeks  in  the  Primary  Analysis  Period.  For  patients  originally 
randomized to placebo who completed the Week 78 visit by the data cutoff (18 July 2012), this CSR 
also  includes  selected  efficacy  data  for  the  initial  39  weeks  of  treatment  with  eliglustat  in  the 
Long-term Treatment Period. All patients who remain on study are now in the Long-term Treatment 
Period,  and  these  patients  may  continue  to  receive  open-label  eliglustat  therapy  until  they  have 
completed up to 6 years of study treatment or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor.

Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to confirm the efficacy and safety of eliglustat (after 39 weeks 
of treatment in patients with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). 
The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  long-term  efficacy,  safety,  and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of eliglustat in patients with GD1. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
All data from the Long-term Treatment Period will be analysed and presented in a final report upon 
completion of the study. Central readers were used for all imaging data (liver and spleen volume, 
bone mineral density [BMD], bone marrow burden [BMB]), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs), and 
dual-lead Holter. 
Efficacy: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in spleen volume from Baseline to Week 39 
for eliglustat, relative to placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage change in 
liver  volume,  percentage  change  in  platelet  count,  and  absolute  change  in  hemoglobin  level  from 
Baseline to Week 39, as well as within-patient analyses of each of the above clinical outcomes over a 
39-week  treatment  with  eliglustat,  including  both  patients  randomized  to  eliglustat  and  patients 
randomized to placebo who completed 39 weeks of  open-label eliglustat treatment as of the data 
cutoff for this report. 
Additional tertiary and exploratory efficacy endpoints included percentage changes in disease-related 
biomarkers (chitotriosidase and chemokine CC motif ligand 18 [CCL18]), spine and femur total BMD, 
and  exploratory  biomarkers  (glucosylceramide  [GL-1]  in  dried  blood  spot  [DBS]  and  GL-1,  GM3, 
macrophage  inflammatory  protein  1  beta  [MIP-1â],  ceramide,  and  sphingomyelin  in  plasma),  and 
absolute changes in spine and femur T and Z-scores, spine, femur, and total BMB scores, Gaucher 
disease assessments (mobility, bone crisis, and bone pain), quality of life scores (brief pain inventory 
[BPI], fatigue severity scale [FSS], 36-item short form health survey [SF-36]), and Gaucher disease 
severity scoring system [DS3] scores from Baseline to Week 39. At Week 39, the number of patients 
who were at the 1-year therapeutic goals previously established for Cerezyme (Pastores, 2004, Semin 
Hematol; Weinreb, 2008, Am J Hematol) was also evaluated. 
Safety: 
Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and medical events of 
interest  (MEOIs)  reported  from  the  time  of  informed  consent  through  completion  of  the  safety 
follow-up period (30-37 days after the patient last dose of study drug); concomitant medications; 
pregnancies in female subjects or female partners of male subjects; chest X-rays (at Screening only); 
and  12-lead  ECGs,  24-hour  dual-lead  Holter  monitoring,  echocardiograms,  physical  examinations, 
body weight, body mass index (BMI), vital sign measurements, neurological examinations, the Mini 
Mental  State  Examination  (MMSE),  and  standard  clinical  laboratory  tests  (hematology,  serum 
chemistry, urinalysis) obtained during the Primary Analysis Period. Medical events of interest were 
defined  as  clinically  significant  cardiac  arrhythmias  that  were  detected  by  electrophysiological 
monitoring and did not meet SAE criteria, and syncope from any cause.

The endpoints as presented by the applicant are typical for studies in patients suffering from Gaucher 
disease. Hence the intended comparison with results obtained with imiglucerase (Pastores, 2004). 
Most important in the analysis of the effect is the effect seen on liver, spleen, haemoglobin, platelets 
and bone.. As known from other published studies these endpoints should be more or less equally 
affected by treatment. The other endpoints are considered useful for they give additional information 
on the patient’s perceived benefit of the treatment. 
Sample size/Randomisation 
A total of 40 patients were randomized and treated with eliglustat (n=20) or placebo (n=20). All 40 
patients were included in the analyses for efficacy, safety, and PK (for sample size calculation see 
paragraph on statistical methods). The number of patients is very small. However given the rarity of 
the disease and the availability of other (effective) treatments it is not to be expected that significant 
more patients could be enrolled. 
Given the small number of patients a 1:1 randomisation appears the only acceptable ratio. 
Statistical methods 
Power and Sample Size: 
The  planned  enrolment  of  approximately  36  patients  was  expected  to  yield  at  least  28  evaluable 
patients at the end of the Primary Analysis Period, allowing for a dropout rate of 20%. Twenty-eight 
patients was estimated to provide 92% power to detect a treatment difference between eliglustat and 
placebo  in  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  based  on  a  2-sided,  2-sample  t-test  with  a  5%  level  of 
significance, and assuming mean percentage decreases in spleen volume from Baseline to Week 39 of 
25% and 5% for eliglustat and placebo, respectively, and a standard deviation of 15%. 
Results 
Participant flow and Recruitment 
Table 1 summarizes the disposition of all randomized patients. In total, 40 patients were randomized 
and treated with eliglustat (20 patients) or placebo (20 patients) across 17 study centers. Thirty-nine 
patients completed the study through Week 39. One patient (#5303) elected to withdraw from the 
study after 166 days on study treatment (eliglustat), and did not complete Week 39 assessments. 
An additional 32 patients were screened for the study, but were not randomized because they failed 
to complete screening procedures, did not meet all eligibility criteria, or chose to withdraw prior to 
randomization. The eligibility criteria that most commonly were not met were spleen size (6 to 30 MN) 
and  platelet  count  (50,000  to  130,000/mm3).  Eight  study  centers  screened  patients,  but  did  not 
identify any qualified patients for randomization.

After  screening  72  patients  40  were  eligible  for  randomisation.  In  this  time  frame  with  various 
effective treatment modalities for this rare disease it is not surprisingly that patients are identified at 
an early stage. And thus not meeting the criteria related to the seriousness of the disease.  
Conduct of the study 
The  mean  time  on  study  treatment  was  274.5  days  (SD=19.94)  overall  and  was  similar  in  the  2 
treatment groups. The majority of patients (75%-92%) in the eliglustat group received 100 mg BID, 
with the remaining patients receiving 50 mg BID. 
Baseline data 
Table 2 summarizes demographic characteristics for the 40 patients in the FAS (Full Analysis Set).  
The population included equivalent numbers of males and females, predominantly white (98%) and of 
non-Jewish descent (73%), who ranged in age from 16.1 to 62.9 years (mean = 31.8 years) on the 
date  of  the  first  dose  of  study  drug.  Demographic  characteristics  were  generally  similar  between 
treatment groups, although the eliglustat group had slightly lower proportions of male patients (40%) 
and patients of Jewish descent (15%) compared with placebo (60% and 40%, respectively).

Numbers analysed 
Forty  patients  were  randomized  to  treatment  with  eliglustat  (n=20)  or  placebo  (n=20).  In  the 
eliglustat group, 17 (85%) patients received a dose escalation to 100 mg BID at Week 4, and 3 (15%) 
patients continued to receive 50 mg BID for the duration of the Primary Analysis Period. Thirty-nine 
patients  completed  the  Primary  Analysis  Period.  One  patient  in  the  eliglustat  treatment  group 
withdrew consent after Week 13. 
Analysis Sets: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all 40 patients who signed informed consent and received at least 
1  dose  of  study  drug  (placebo  or  eliglustat),  and  is  equivalent  to  the  intent-to-treat  population 
referenced in the protocol. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) included the 38 patients in the FAS who were at 
least  80%  compliant  with  treatment  during  the  Primary  Analysis  Period,  had  no  major  protocol 
deviations expected to interfere with the assessment of efficacy as defined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan, and did not exhibit hematological decline as a result of medically determined etiologies other 
than Gaucher disease. The Week 39 Completer Analysis Set included the 39 patients in the FAS who 
completed 39 weeks of treatment and had non-missing assessments at Baseline and Week 39. The 
Safety  Analysis  Set  was  equivalent  to  the  FAS.  The  PK  Analysis  Set  included  all  20  patients  who 
received at least 1 dose of eliglustat and had measurable drug concentrations. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Eliglustat demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint, the 
percentage reduction in spleen volume from Baseline to Week 39. Over this 39-week period, the least 
squares (LS) mean percentage decrease in spleen volume (in MN) was -27.77% for the eliglustat 
treatment  group  compared  with  an  increase  of  +2.26%  for  the  placebo  group,  resulting  in  a 
statistically significant treatment difference of -30.03% (p<0.0001).  
The percentage reduction in spleen volume with eliglustat therapy was not correlated with a patient's 
Baseline  spleen  volume.  Overall,  15  of  20  patients  in  the  eliglustat  treatment  group  showed  a 
clinically meaningful response for spleen volume, defined as >20% reduction from Baseline to Week 
39,  whereas  only  1  of  20  placebo  patients  met  this  definition  of  a  responder.  An  evaluation  of 
eliglustat treated patients did not suggest a clear relationship between treatment response and acid 
β-glucosidase  genotype  (i.e.,  mutations  associated  with  a  mild  [N370S]  versus  severe  [L444P] 
pathology). 
All patients in the study presented with splenomegaly at Baseline, with mean spleen volumes of 13.89 
MN for eliglustat treatment group and 12.50 MN for the placebo group. The eliglustat treatment group 
showed a marked percentage reduction in spleen volume (MN) by the first post-Baseline assessment 
at Week 26 (mean = -25.16%), and a continued reduction in spleen volume through Week 39 (mean 
=  -27.58%).  In  contrast,  the  placebo  group  showed  small  mean  percentage  increases  in  spleen 
volume at both time points (mean = 0.73% and 2.07%, respectively). Mean (SD) spleen volumes and 
mean percentage changes from Baseline are plotted over time for each treatment group in Fig 1, 
respectively.

MN = multiples of normal; SD = standard deviation 
Note: Percentage changes are calculated only for patients who have data at Baseline and the specified time point. Baseline refers 
to the last assessment prior to the first dose of study drug on Day 1. 
Note: Last observation carried forward (LOCF) is used for 1 patient in the eliglustat group (#5303) who withdrew from the study 
prior to the Week 39 assessment 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Eliglustat demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo on all secondary efficacy endpoints, 
including absolute change in hemoglobin levels, percentage change in liver volume, and percentage 
change in platelet counts from Baseline to Week 39. 
Statistically significant within-patient changes were observed for the mean percentage reduction in 
spleen  volume in  MN  (-28.99%,  p<0.0001),  mean percentage  reduction  in  liver  volume  (-5.06%, 
p=0.0017), absolute increase in haemoglobin level (+0.9 g/dL, p=0.0003), and mean percentage 
increase in platelet count (29.77%, p<0.0001). 
Nineteen (19) of 20 patients in the eliglustat treatment group met one (n=8), two (n=9), or three 
(n=2)  of  the  1-year  therapeutic  goals  (as  previously  established  for  Gaucher  patients  on 
imiglucerase; Pastores, 2004, Semin Hematol; Weinreb, 2008, Am J Hematol), including goals for 
hemoglobin  level,  spleen  volume,  and/or  platelet  count.  These  19  patients  either  attained 
ormaintained these goals relative to their Baseline status. Liver volume, which was already <1.5 MN 
in  the  majority  (70%)  patients  at  Baseline,  was  further  reduced  by  Week  39  in  84%  of  patients 
receiving eliglustat, although none of these patients achieved the 1-year goal of a ≥20% reduction 
from  Baseline.  In  contrast,  for  patients  in  the  placebo  group,  haemoglobin  was  the  only  1-year 
therapeutic goal that was met at Week 39 (in 14 of 20 patients), and 3 fewer patients met this goal at 
Week 39 than at Baseline. 
All 40 patients in this study had Baseline total BMB scores indicative of moderate or marked-to-severe 
bone  marrow  infiltration  with  Gaucher  cells.  At  Week  39,  a  statistically  significant  reversal  of  this 
infiltration  was  observed  in  both  the  spine  BMB  score  (LS  mean  treatment  difference  =  -0.6, 
p=0.0024) and femur BMB score  (LS mean treatment difference = -0.4, p=0.0255), as well as the 
total BMB score (LS mean treatment difference = -1.1, p=0.0021). In the eliglustat group, total BMB 
score decreased for 15 (79%) of the 19 patients with data at Baseline and Week 39, with 5 patients 
having at least a 2-point reduction in total BMB score, and 3 patients having a shift in BMB category 
from marked-to-severe to moderate bone marrow infiltration. In the placebo group, 17 of 20 patients 
had minimal (<1 point) increases or decreases or no change in total BMB score, 2  patients had an 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 41/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase of at least 1 point, and 1 patient had a reduction of at least 1 point; no shifts in BMB category 
were observed for any patient in the placebo group. 
Eliglustat also showed a positive trend on BMD in the lumbar spine, including a mean increase in total 
treatment difference = 0.2, p= p=0.0604). Eliglustat did not have an effect on femur total BMD, T- or 
Z-scores during the initial 39 weeks of treatment in this study. Statistically significant reductions in 
plasma MIP-1β, which is considered to be a  biomarker of active bone disease, were observed with 
eliglustat compared with placebo (LS mean treatment difference = -43.5 pg/mL, p<0.0001). 
Statistically significant reductions (p<0.0001) were also observed for the disease-related biomarker 
chitotriosidase,  which  are  believed  to  reflect  Gaucher  cell  burden,  and  for  several  biomarkers  of 
eliglustat  pharmacological  activity  (plasma  and  DBS  GL-1,  plasma  GM3),  with  the  majority  of 
eliglustat-treated patients  achieving normal GL-1 and GM3 levels by Week 39. Sphingomyelin and 
ceramide remained within normal range for all patients during the Primary Analysis Period, indicating 
that inhibition of GL-1 synthesis did not result in abnormal accumulation of the precursor substrate 
(ceramide)  or  another  glycosphingolipid  synthesized  from  that  substrate  (sphingomyelin).  These 
effects are discussed further under pharmacodynamics. 
Total  Gaucher  DS3  score,  which  measures  the  degree  of  GD1  disease  burden  across  3  domains 
(visceral, bone,  and haematological) was significantly reduced with eliglustat treatment, relative to 
placebo (LS mean treatment difference = -0.3, p=0.0452). 
Small,  non-statistically  significant  but  consistent  improvements  in  the  SF-36  version  2  physical 
component summary and its 4 scales were observed with eliglustat treatment, including a statistically 
significant treatment difference over placebo for the physical functioning scale. No consistent trends 
were  observed  for  the  SF-36  mental  component  summary  and  its  4  scales.  Eliglustat  had  no 
meaningful effect on the patients' perception of fatigue (FSS) and pain severity or interference with 
daily activities (BPI); in general, patients in the study reported little to no fatigue or pain at Baseline, 
and remained stable at Week 39. 
Gaucher assessments of  mobility, bone pain, and bone crises were generally unremarkable; most 
patients  had  unrestricted mobility  and  minimal  or  no  bone  pain  throughout  the  study,  and  only  1 
patient (placebo group) had a reported bone crisis.

Therapy (ENCORE) 
Methods 
This multi-center, multinational Phase 3 study included a screening period (Days -45 to -1), a primary 
analysis treatment period (Day 1 to Week 52), a long-term treatment period (post-Week 52 through 
study completion), and a safety follow up period (30 to 37 days after the patient’s last dose of study 
medication). 
Patients who met all eligibility criteria based on screening assessments were randomized to receive 
treatment  with  eliglustat  or  Cerezyme  during  the  52-week  Primary  Analysis  Period.  The 
randomization was stratified based on the patient's every 2 weeks (q2w) equivalent ERT dose (<35 
U/kg/q2w or ≥35 U/kg/q2w) prior to any unanticipated treatment interruption, dose reduction, or 
regimen change. Within each stratum patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive eliglustat or 
Cerezyme, respectively for 52 weeks (the primary analysis treatment period). All patients randomized 
to eliglustat received a dose of 50 mg BID from Day 1 to Week 4; thereafter, patients received a dose 
of  either  50  or  100  mg  BID  through  Week  8,  depending  on  their  trough  plasma  concentration  of 
Eliglustat at Week 2. Post-Week 8, patients randomized to eliglustat received a dose of either 50, 100 
or 150 mg BID through Week 52, depending on their trough plasma concentration of Eliglustat at 
Week 6 (see Dose/Route/Regimen for details).

include safety, efficacy, and PK data collected through Week 52 for all patients as of the data cutoff 
date of 09 November 2012. 
Study Participants  
Randomized patients met all protocol-defined eligibility criteria, including (but not limited to) the 
following key criteria: 
•  Age ≥18 years at the time of randomization. 
•  Tanner Stage ≥4 prior to randomization. 
•  Diagnosis of GD1 confirmed by a documented deficiency of acid â-glucosidase activity by enzyme 
assay. 
•  Received treatment with ERT for at least 3 years. For at least 6 of the 9 months prior to 
randomization, the patient had received a total monthly dose of 30 to 130 U/kg of ERT that had 
received approval by at least 1 regulatory authority by the time of randomization. 
•  Reached Gaucher disease therapeutic goals prior to randomization. Gaucher disease therapeutic 
goals were defined as a patient with all of the following: 
  A.No bone crisis and free of symptomatic bone disease such as bone pain attributable to 
osteonecrosis and/or pathological fractures within the last year. 
  B.Mean hemoglobin level of ≥11 g/dL if female and ≥12 g/dL if male at the time of screening. 
  C.Mean platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 at the time of screening. 
•  Spleen volume <10 times Normal or total splenectomy (provided the splenectomy occurred >3 
years prior to randomization). 
•  Liver volume <1.5 times Normal. 
•  No treatment with substrate reduction therapy within 6 months prior to randomization. 
Investigational products 
•  No treatment with any of the following medications within 30 days prior to randomization: 
• 
•  Medications that may cause QTc interval prolongation Exception: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or 
other medications used as premedication for ERT infusions were allowed up to 7 days prior to 
Inducers of CYP3A4 with the exception of premedications for ERT infusion, which were allowed up 
randomization. 
• 
to 7 days prior to randomization. 
•  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, if the patient was a CYP2D6 poor or indeterminate metabolizer 
•  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6, if the patient was not a CYP2D6 poor or indeterminate 
metabolizer, except where a patient had chronically received either medication (but not both) for at 
least 30 days prior to randomization and was continuing the same dosing regimen during the primary 
analysis period of this study. 
•  The patient was not transfusion-dependent 
•  No documented prior esophageal varices or liver infarction, and no current results for alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin >2 times the upper 
limit of normal (ULN), unless the patient had a diagnosis of Gilbert Syndrome. 
•  No history of partial or total splenectomy within 3 years prior to randomization. 
•  No known hypersensitivity to Cerezyme. 
Except for the criteria used for CYP 3A4 and CYP 2D6 this population is typical for a population 
suffering from Gaucher disease. 
Treatments 
Eliglustat was supplied as 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg capsules. All doses of eliglustat were taken 
orally  with  water.  Cerezyme  was  administered  as  an  intravenous  (IV)  infusion,  in  a  q2w  regimen 
equivalent to the patient’s ERT dose prior to any unanticipated treatment interruption, dose reduction, 
or regimen change. 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 45/75 
 
 
 
 
The approach to optimise the eliglustat dose is comparable with the method in study GZGD02507. 
Cthrough  concentration  should  be  above  5  ng/ml  while  the  peak  plasma  concentration  should  not 
exceed the 150 ng/ml. The lower limit is based on the IC50 for GL-1 inhibition in vitro. The upper limit 
is to ensure that patients avoid a level of Genz-99067 that does not allow an adequate safety margin 
in the case of an unexpected concomitant medication that interacts with eliglustat. This method is not 
the advised dose regimen in the SmPC.  
Treatment with imiglucerase was according to the regimen advised in the imiglucerase SmPC. 
Following a 45-day Screening period, each patient was treated with eliglustat or imiglucerase for 52 
weeks. After the 52-week primary analysis treatment period, all patients were treated with eliglustat. 
Each patient’s total duration of participation in this study will be at least 104 weeks, and participation 
may continue for a total of up to 5.5 years or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor. The study 
duration was considered to be sufficient to observe any change in the mayor endpoints (spleen, liver, 
bone marrow).  
Objectives 
Primary Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of eliglustat compared with (imiglucerase) after 
52 weeks of treatment in patients with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) who have reached therapeutic 
goals with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). 
Secondary Objective: To demonstrate that, in patients with GD1 who have reached therapeutic goals 
with ERT, the majority of patients who receive eliglustat remain stable after 52 weeks of treatment. 
Tertiary Objective: To evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of eliglustat 
in patients with GD1 who have reached therapeutic goals with ERT. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage (%) of patients who remained stable for 52 weeks 
(the primary analysis period) assessed for both treatment groups separately along with a difference 
between the two treatment groups. For a patient to be considered to have demonstrated a clinically 
meaningful  response  to  treatment  with  eliglustat  or  Cerezyme,  patients  must  remain  stable  in 
hematological parameters (hemoglobin levels and platelet counts), and organ volumes (spleen, when 
applicable, and liver volumes in multiples of normal [MN]). A blinded Independent Adjudication Board 
(IAB) reviewed and confirmed that failure to meet the primary endpoint was attributed to a decline in 
Gaucher disease. 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  the  following:  Total  T-  and  Z-scores  for  bone  mineral 
density  (dualenergy  X-ray  absorptiometry  [DXA])  of  femur  and  lumbar  spine,  hemoglobin  level, 
platelet  count,  and  spleen  and  liver  volumes  (in  MN)  (assessed  by  magnetic  resonance  imaging 
[MRI]). 
The  tertiary  efficacy  endpoints  included  the  following:  Biomarkers  (chemokine  CC  motif  ligand  18 
[CCL18] and chitotriosidase); bone disease assessments (X-ray, MRI and bone marrow burden score); 
Gaucher  assessments  (mobility,  bone  crisis,  and  bone  pain);  Quality  of  Life  (QOL)  (Brief  Pain 
Inventory [BPI], Fatigue Severity Score [FSS], Short Form-36 Health Survey [SF-36]), and treatment 
preference  (oral  vs  intravenous  therapy).  Exploratory  endpoints  include  Gaucher  disease  Severity 
Score System (DS3) and the percent changes from Baseline in investigational biomarkers including 
glucosylceramide (GL-1) assayed from dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper and from plasma, as 
well  as  GM3,  ceramide,  high-sensitivity  C-reactive  protein  (hsCRP),  apolipoprotein-B-100, 
sphingomyelin, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1β) (assayed from plasma).

The endpoints as presented by the applicant were considered by the CHMP as typical for studies in 
patients suffering from Gaucher disease. Most important in the analysis is the effect seen on liver, 
spleen and bone marrow. As known from other published studies these endpoints should be more or 
less equally affected by treatment. The other endpoints are considered useful as they give additional 
information on the patient’s perceived benefit of the treatment or the pharmacodynamic effect of the 
SRT. 
Sample size and Randomisation 
It was planned that approximately 150 patients would be randomized in order to yield at least 120 
evaluable patients at the end of 52 weeks (the primary analysis treatment period). Patients were 
randomized  2:1  to  receive  eliglustat  or  Cerezyme.  A  total  of  160  patients  were  randomized  to 
treatment with eliglustat (n=106) or Cerezyme (n=54). One patient randomized to the Cerezyme 
group was not treated. All treated patients were included in the analyses for efficacy, safety, and 
pharmacokinetics. The number of patients is very small. However given the rarity of the disease and 
the availability of other (effective) treatments it is not to be expected that significant more patients 
could be enrolled. Given the small number of patients a 2:1 randomisation (eliglustat : imiglucerase)  
appears the only acceptable ratio. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. However, selected efficacy and safety evaluations were performed by 
external  central  readers  who  were  blinded  to  treatment  assignment.  These  blinded  evaluations 
included organ volume and bone imaging data, ECG and Holter monitor data, and nerve conduction 
data. A blinded Independent Adjudication Board (IAB) reviewed and confirmed instances of failure to 
meet the primary endpoint. 
Statistical methods 
Power and Sample Size: 
The sample size for this non-inferiority study was based on expected stability rates of 95% for the 
Cerezyme  treatment  group  (active-comparator)  and  85%  for  the  eliglustat  treatment  group  (test 
treatment), power of 85%, a one-sided significance level of 0.025, a non-inferiority margin of 25%, 
and a 20% non-evaluable/drop-out rate. 
Analysis Sets: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all patients who signed informed consent and received at least 1 
dose of study drug (eliglustat or imiglucerase), and is equivalent to the intent-to-treat population 
referenced in the protocol. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) included patients in the FAS who were at least 
80% compliant with treatment during the Primary Analysis Period, had no major protocol deviations 
expected to interfere with the assessment of efficacy as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan, and 
did  not  exhibit  hematological  decline  as  a  result  of  medically  determined  etiologies  other  than 
Gaucher  disease.  Patients  receiving  eliglustat  who  transitioned  back  to  Cerezyme  due  to  clinical 
decline  were  included  in  the  PPS  and  considered  treatment  failures  regardless  of  their  Week  52 
assessments. The PPS was determined prior to database lock. 
The  Week  52  Completer  Analysis  Set  included  patients  in  the  FAS  who  completed  52  weeks  of 
treatment and had non-missing assessments at Baseline and Week 52. The Safety Set was equivalent 
to the FAS. The PK Analysis Set included all patients who received at least 1 dose of eliglustat and had 
measurable drug concentrations. 
The  statistical  analysis  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  standard  with  respect  to  the  arbitrary 
established type I and II errors (type I < 5% and a type II > 80%) to be respected. If the lower-bound

of  the  95%  CI  for  the  difference  was  within  the  non-inferiority  margin  of  25%,  then  eliglustat 
treatment was declared non-inferior to Cerezyme treatment. This non-inferiority margin is considered 
too broad. As mentioned in the EMA SA (2009 and 2011) with the applicant a margin of 20% or even 
less is acceptable. 
Results 
Recruitment and Participant flow 
Patient enrolment in this study was conducted from 15 September 2009 to 04 November 2011. 
Patient disposition for all randomized patients is shown in  
Table 4. One hundred sixty (160) patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with eliglustat 
(n=106) or Cerezyme (n=54). One patient in the Cerezyme group was randomized but did not receive 
study treatment. One patient in the eliglustat group switched to Cerezyme treatment and completed 
the  52-week  primary  analysis  period.  Two  patients  in  the  eliglustat  group  and  1  patient  in  the 
Cerezyme group did not complete the primary analysis period due to adverse events.  
Table 4: Patient Disposition - All Randomized Patients 
In total, 206 patients were screened at 39 study centers. Five study centers screened patients but did 
not identify any patients that qualified for randomization.  
Conduct of the study 
Due  to  dose  titration  the  eliglustat  dose  varied  between  the  various  patients.  At  the  end  of  the 
protocol-defined titration period the percentage of patients receiving the 3 possible eliglustat doses 
was: 50 mg BID (20%; 21/106), 100 mg BID (32%; 34/106) and 150 mg BID (48%; 51/106). 
The mean number of Cerezyme infusions per patient during the Primary Analysis Period was 24.6 
(±3.4) consistent with the q2w dosing interval employed in this study. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics for the PPS are summarized in  
Table. The patient population included more females (56%) than males (44%); most patients were 
White (93%) and of non-Jewish descent (73%). The mean age of patients enrolled was 38 years (age 
range from 18 to 69 years on the date of the first dose of study drug). Demographic characteristics, 
including  ERT  dose  at  study  entry,  were  balanced  across  the  treatment  groups.  Demographic 
characteristics in the FAS were similar.

Numbers analysed 
Outcomes and estimation 
Based on the aggregate data from all doses tested in this study, eliglustat met the criteria set by the 
applicant  in  this  study  to  be  declared  non-inferior  to  imiglucerase  in  maintaining  patient  stability. 
After 12 months of treatment, the percentage of patients meeting the primary composite endpoint 
was 84.8% ([95% confidence interval 76.2% - 91.3%] for the eliglustat group compared to 93.6% 
[95% confidence interval 82.5% - 98.7 %] for the imiglucerase group. The lower bound of the 95% 
CI  in  the  difference  in  percentage  (-18.6%)  was  within  the  threshold  of  -25%,  as  defined  by  the 
applicant.  
Furthermore,  eliglustat  met  the  criteria  to  be  declared  non-inferior  to  imiglucerase  for  the 
FDA-recommended efficacy endpoint of percentage change in spleen volume. The least squares (LS) 
mean percentage change in spleen volume (MN) from Baseline to Week 52 in the eliglustat group was 
Cerdelga

Page 49/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-5.96%  compared  to  -3.21%  in  the  imiglucerase  group.  The  upper  bound  of  the  95%  CI  in  the 
difference of the estimated mean change (2.62%) was less than the pre-specified threshold of 15%.

a The stability criteria based on changes between baseline and 12 months: haemoglobin 
level ≤1.5 g/dL decrease, platelet count ≤25% decrease, liver volume ≤20% increase, and 
spleen volume ≤25% increase. 
The  data  from  the  ICGG  registry,  which  the  applicant  refers  to  support  the  choice  of  the  25%  NI 
margin of the applicant in this aspect. However, in clinical practice margins of 15 to 20% are used to 
define stability/success of treatment. The NI of 20%, as recommended by CHMP, provides assurance 
on the efficacy of eliglustat to maintain stability, which should be based on historical data. Results 
from the ENCORE study show that for 85% of the patient treated stability was observed after one year 
of  treatment.  For  the  remaining  patients  alternative  treatment  should  be  considered.  Given  the 
reversibility of the deterioration this can be considered a reasonable approach (knowledge gained 
from the imiglucerase shortage).  
At Week 52, the proportion of patients that met the stability criteria for the individual components of 
the  composite  endpoint  was:  hemoglobin  (94.9%  eliglustat;  100%  imiglucerase),  platelet  count 
(92.9% eliglustat; 100% imiglucerase), spleen volume (95.8% eliglustat; 100% imiglucerase), and 
liver volume (96.0% eliglustat; 93.6% imiglucerase). 
Absolute  change  from  baseline  in  hemoglobin  values  was  the  only  component  of  the  composite 
endpoint  that  showed  a  statistically  significant  difference  favouring  imiglucerase  after  52  weeks 
(-0.28 mg/dL, p=0.0253), but the amount of change observed was not clinically meaningful. BMD 
values  were  within  the  normal  range  for  the  majority  of  patients  upon  study  entry  and  were 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015

maintained over 52 weeks of treatment with both eliglustat and imiglucerase. There was no significant 
difference in mean change from baseline in BMD values between treatments. 
Minimal differences between groups were observed after 52 weeks of treatment with respect to Bone 
Marrow Burden Score, Gaucher Disease Severity Score, Gaucher assessments (mobility, bone pain, 
bone crises), quality of life questionnaires (pain, BPI; fatigue, FSS; and general health, SF-36) and 
various  biomarkers  (plasma  chitotriosidase  activity  and  ceramide,  C-reactive  protein,  apo-B-100, 
MIP-1β and sphingomyelin concentrations). Substantial reductions in the plasma concentrations of 
GL-1  and  GM3  with  eliglustat,  but  not  imiglucerase,  are  consistent  with  eliglustat’s  mechanism  of 
action as a substrate reduction therapy that inhibits glucosylceramide synthase. 
Following 52 weeks of treatment, eliglustat patients confirmed preference for an oral treatment with 
reasons given for the preference including: more convenient, taken at home, given by tablets, and felt 
better  after  treatment.  The  continued  stabilisation  in  94%  of  the  patients  remaining  on  the  ERT 
(imiglucerase) provides reassurance that this study has sufficient assay sensitivity

Bone effects 
In the patients enrolled in Study GZGD00304 at least some dark marrow (Gaucher cells) was present 
at  baseline  in  the  femurs  of  nearly  all  enrolled  patients  at  Baseline.  Long-term  results  in  the  18 
patients  with  data  at  Baseline  and  Year  4  show  that  after  4  years  of  treatment,  56%  of  patients 
showed improvement in 1 to 6 zones, while the other 44% patients remained stable.  
In the Phase 2 study, 76% of the 25 patients with evaluable DXA at Baseline had evidence of bone 
loss: 11 with osteopenia and 8 with osteoporosis. The total lumbar spine BMD increased by a mean 
(SD)  of  4.4%  (6.7%).  This  increase  in  mean  (SD)  BMD  from  0.97  (0.16)  to  1.01  (0.16)  g/cm2 
corresponded  to  increases  in  mean  (SD)  T-score  from-1.75  (1.07)  to  -1.43  (1.02),  both  in  the 
osteopenia range, for a mean increase of 0.33, p=0.0073, and Z score from -1.37 (0.94) to -1.09 
(0.95) for a mean increase of 0.29 (0.46); p=0.012. In the 15 patients with data at Baseline and Year 
4, lumbar spine BMD (g/cm2) increased significantly (p=0.02) by a mean (SD) of 9.9% (14.2%); the 
mean lumbar spine T-score of -1.6 (SD 1.1) at Baseline, in the osteopenic range, reached the normal 
range  after  4  years  of  treatment  at  -0.9  (SD  1.3),  representing  a  mean  change  of  0.8  (SD  1.0; 
p=0.0139);  and  the  mean  Z-score  increased  from  1.2  (SD  0.9)  at  Baseline  to  -0.5  (SD  1.1), 
representing a mean change of 0.7 (0.8; p=0.0044) after 4 years. The major gains in BMD occurred 
among osteoporotic patients and osteopenic patients with little change among patients with normal 
BMD T-scores. The ENGAGE study further strengthened these observations. 
In  ENGAGE,  at  Baseline,  patients  had  mean  total  BMB  scores  in  the  marked-to-severe  marrow 
infiltration range. After 9  months, eliglustat-treated patients showed a 1.1-point decrease in total 
BMB score, with similar contributions from the femur and spine BMB sub-scores, and 5/19 (26%) 
eliglustat-treated  patients  with  data  had  at  least  a  2-point  decrease  in  total  BMB  score.  By 
comparison, the placebo group showed no change in mean total BMB score from Baseline to Month 9 
(treatment difference p-value=0.0021). In ENCORE, BMB scores were essentially unchanged in both 
treatment groups over the 52-week Primary Analysis Period. 
There was no significant difference in mean change from Baseline in lumbar spine and femur BMD, 
T-scores, or Z-scores between treatments in the ENCORE study, an expected result given that the 
goal of the study was to measure maintenance of stability in these patients. 
Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Patient-reported  outcomes,  including  the  Gaucher  Disease  Severity  Scoring  System  and  various 
measures  of  Quality  of  life  (QOL),  were  assessed  in  the  efficacy  studies.  Small  but  consistent 
improvements in some measures were noted, and in ENGAGE, statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful treatment difference of eliglustat over placebo was observed for the physical functioning

scale  of  the  Medical  Outcomes  Study  36-item  Short  Form  (SF-36;  LS  Mean  difference=13.2, 
p=0.0110). 
In ENCORE (the only study where this was possible), all treated patients completed a questionnaire at 
screening that evaluated treatment preference (oral vs IV), reasons for treatment preference, and 
overall  satisfaction  with  treatment.  The  questionnaire  was  administered  again  at  Week  52  (if 
randomised  to  eliglustat).  Ninety-four  percent  of  patients  in  the  eliglustat  group  and  93%  in  the 
imiglucerase  group  indicated  an  a  priori  preference  for  oral  treatment.  Following  52  weeks  of 
treatment the proportion of eliglustat patients who confirmed preference for an oral treatment was 
94%. The most frequent reasons given for the preference of oral therapy were: more convenient, 
taken at home, given by tablets, and felt better after treatment. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dosing and design of clinical studies 
In  the  clinical  development  of  eliglustat  dosing  was  based  on  plasma  levels  of  eliglustat.  In  the 
primary  analysis  periods  (PAP)  of  the  two  pivotal  Phase  3  studies,  ENGAGE  and  ENCORE,  dosing 
started at eliglustat 50 mg BID. At Week 4, patients randomised to eliglustat could have their dose 
titrated up to 100 mg BID if the patient’s Genz-99067 Ctrough was <5 ng/mL at Week 2. In ENCORE, 
but not ENGAGE, if the patient’s Ctrough remained at <5 ng/mL at Week 6, dosing could be titrated 
further up to 150 mg BID at Week 8. In case the Cmax was >150 ng/ml the dose was lowered or if 
necessary stopped temporarily. The currently proposed standard dose of 100 mg BID for IM and EM 
patients is derived from these data and based on modelling of PK/PD data by CYP2D6 genotype. For 
patients who are poor metabolizers (PM) a 100mg QD dose is advised based on physiologically-based 
pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  simulations  (see  also  PK  part).  Ultra-rapid  metabolisers  (URM)  were  not 
recommended for this treatment due to limited data. 
The mean endpoints were changes in liver and spleen volume, haemoglobin level and platelet count. 
Other  endpoints  were  biomarkers  (GL-1,  GM3,  ceramide,  sphingomyelin),  QoL  and  bone  mineral 
density.  These  clinical  measures  represent  the  more  common  manifestations  of  GD  that  may  be 
responsive to treatment in the short term, and have been investigated in previous studies of ERT or 
SRT in patients with GD1. Therefore, the measurements that have been carried out are considered 
clinically relevant. 
Because  eliglustat  is  an  oral  therapy  and  the  comparator  therapy  in  ENCORE,  imiglucerase,  is 
administered  via  iv  infusion,  ENCORE  was  designed  as  an  open-label  study.  While  an  open-label 
design  is  considered  to  be  less  rigorous  than  a  blinded  design,  the  potential  for  patient  and/or 
physician bias with respect to efficacy was considered to be low because all four components of the 
primary composite endpoint (spleen and liver volumes and haemoglobin level and platelet count), are 
objective  measurements,  and  the  organ  volume  assessments  were  centrally  read  by  independent 
organization, blinded to treatment. Therefore the open label design is acceptable. 
Selection of patients  
The majority of the patients in the studies were white, approximately 25% were Jewish, and most 
were  young  adults.  Approximately  28%  of  ENCORE  patients  had  total  splenectomies  and  1%  had 
partial splenectomies, compared to none in the treatment naïve studies, which is a consequence of 
different exclusion criteria for the different studies. CYP2D6 phenotype was fairly consistent across 
studies. Approximately 82% of patients were CYP2D6 EMs, 10% were IMs, and 3% each were PMs 
and URMs, in accordance with population estimates. 
Further analysis for a trend by ethnicity did not lead to conclusions as a non-Caucasian population as 
these were virtually not included. 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 54/75 
 
 
 
 
A  high  percentage  of  patients  in  all  studies  completed  the  PAP  (97.5%  completed  39  weeks  in 
ENGAGE; 85% completed 52 weeks in the Phase 2 study; and 98% completed 52 weeks in ENCORE). 
Additionally, in the Phase 2 study, 19 patients (73%) completed Month 48. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Treatment-Naïve Patients 
Both  studies  in  treatment-naïve  patients  met  their  primary  endpoint.  In  ENGAGE,  there  was  a 
statistically significant mean reduction in spleen volume between the eliglustat and placebo groups 
after 9 months (-30.03%; 95% CI -36.82 to -23.24; p <0.0001). Most (75%) of the eliglustat-treated 
patients achieved a clinically meaningful reduction of at least 20% in spleen volume compared to only 
5% of placebo treated patients. In addition, all secondary endpoints showed statistically significant 
and  clinically  meaningful  changes,  including  absolute  change  in  haemoglobin  level  (1.22  g/dL; 
p=0.0006),  percentage  change  in  liver  volume  (-6.64%;  p=0.0072),  and  percentage  change  in 
platelet  count  (41.06%;  p<0.0001).  In  the  Phase  2  study  (treatment  naïve  patients),  77%  of  all 
treated patients and 91% of all study completers met the composite primary efficacy endpoint after 
one year of eliglustat treatment. Furthermore, statistically significant improvements in all 4 organ 
volume and haematology parameters were observed at Week 52 and were maintained or continued to 
improve through Month 48. 
The  lack  of  data  on  comparison  of  eliglustat  with  imiglucerase  (or  other  ERT)  in  treatment  naïve 
patients was noted by the CHMP. The applicant explored the possibility of a non-inferiority study for 
such a study that would address the issue of the efficacy of eliglustat compared to imiglucerase in the 
best possible way. However such a study would need at least 76 patients to gain sufficient power. The 
CHMP agreed that given the rareness of the disease this is not considered feasible. Further the short 
timeframe available limits the possibility of such study. 
Indirect  comparison  of  efficacy  data  of  eliglustat  with  imiglucerase  (ICGG  database)  indicate  that 
comparable  treatment  effects  are  seen  for  the  most  important  endpoints  during  the  4  years  of 
treatment. Further, continued improvement with eliglustat from 39 weeks of treatment to 78 weeks 
(1.5 years) in Phase 3 treatment-naïve patients (ENGAGE) is shown on established clinical treatment 
outcomes  for  GD1,  in  addition  to  clinically  meaningful  effects  on  bone  disease. Given  the  indirect 
comparison it can be concluded that a reasonable percentage of patients treated with eliglustat will 
achieve  comparable  results  as  are  to  be expected  for  the  already  registered ERT.  Consequently  a 
minority should not reach sufficient effectiveness (as expressed in criteria used in the Phase 2 study: 
in decrease in liver and spleen volume <15%, increase in thrombocytes <15% Hb increase <0.5 g/dl 
after  one  year  of  treatment).  Reinstitution  of  enzyme  replacement  therapy  or  an  alternative 
treatment modality should be considered in individual patients who have a sub-optimal response and 
this was included in the SmPC. The convenience of oral use of eliglustat as compared to the bi-weekly 
imiglucerase infusions (and consequent infusion related reactions) was noted by the CHMP.  
Patients Switching from ERT 
Based on the aggregate data from all doses tested in this study, eliglustat met the criteria set in this 
study  to  be  declared  non-inferior  to  imiglucerase  in  maintaining  patient  stability.    The  primary 
composite endpoint required maintenance of stability based on changes in the haemoglobin level, 
platelet count, and spleen and liver volumes that could not exceed pre-specified thresholds for any of 
the  4  components,  and  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  conducted  using  the  per-protocol 
population, which included 99 eliglustat-treated patients and 47 imiglucerase-treated patients. After 
52  weeks  of  treatment,  the  composite  endpoint  was  maintained  in  only  85%  of  patients  in  the 
eliglustat group compared to 94% of patients in the imiglucerase group. This was considered of major 
concern  and  therefore  the  long-term  sustainability  of  eliglustat’s  effect  in  comparison  with  the 
approved ERT. The lower bound of the 95% exact CI for the eliglustat group (75.1%) supports the 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 55/75 
 
 
 
 
claim that the majority of eliglustat-treated patients maintained stability after 52 weeks of treatment. 
In case patients show a clinical deterioration during SRT (increase in liver and spleen volume >25%, 
increase in thrombocyte count > 25% and Hb decrease >1.5 g/dL after one year of treatment) the 
patients and the treating physician should consider to switch to other treatment options (ERT) which 
may be more beneficial to the particular individual. This is adequately mentioned in the SmPC. 
The lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between treatment groups (-17.6%) was within the 
non-inferiority margin of -25% as pre-specified by the applicant. However, both the choice of the 
non-inferiority margin (-25% defined by the applicant versus -20% defined by the CHMP during the 
Protocol  Assistance  procedure)  and  the  method  used  to  calculate  the  confidence  interval  for 
evaluation of non-inferiority were questioned by the CHMP. Based on strict statistics, the pre-specified 
primary analysis has an inflated type I error, therefore does not fulfill the regulatory requirements 
hence was considered not acceptable. Upon request by CHMP, the applicant provided further efficacy 
analysis  for  95%  confidence  intervals  using  various  recognized  methods  from  major  statistical 
journals and major statistical software packages. In view of the CHMP the noninferiority with a margin 
of  -20%  was  not  demonstrated  as  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  did  not  exclude  -20%  for  all 
methods that may have been considered a reasonable choice for the primary analysis method at time 
of planning of the study. Therefore, the CHMP considered, non-inferiority of the proposed regimen 
(200mg daily for EM and IM only) to the ERT was not comprehensively demonstrated. However the 
benefit-risk of eliglustat in treatment experienced patients is considered positive. The PI is updated to 
mention the somewhat higher failure rate compared to ERT and the percentages of patients meeting 
the primary composite endpoint on eliglustat and imiglucerase in the ENCORE study are reflected in 
the SmPC. 
Bone marrow data 
Overall these data demonstrate an improvement in bone marrow infiltration and BMD with eliglustat 
treatment in treatment-naïve patients, particularly those with more severe bone disease at baseline, 
and maintenance of stable bone disease in patients switched from ERT to eliglustat. 
Proposed CYP2D6 Phenotype-Based Dosing Regimen 
In the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies, patients initially received eliglustat 50 mg BID, with the 
potential for subsequent dose increases based on trough plasma concentrations (Ctrough). According to 
the applicant, this approach would be complicated by the need for the repeat testing of Genz-99067 
plasma levels in the setting of potentially large fluctuations in exposure. These analyses could only be 
conducted at a limited number of laboratory sites and would require the patient to precisely time the 
last dose so that the plasma level could be accurately interpreted. 
A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis using data from healthy subjects and GD1 patients 
showed  that  CYP2D6  phenotype  (PM,  IM,  EM,  or  URM)  was  the  most  significant  determinant  of 
exposure  to  eliglustat.  Therefore,  a  dosing  regimen  based  on  CYP2D6  phenotype  is  proposed  for 
post-marketing use. The recommended use of eliglustat will be only acceptable for the PM, IM and EM 
patients  (which  is  expected  to  constitute  approximately  97%  of  patients)  using  a  single  dosing 
regimen of 100 mg BID (IM and EM patients) or QD (PM patients). 
As claimed by the applicant, simplifying the eliglustat dosing regimen by targeting PMs, IMs and EMs 
only,  with  a  single  dose  strength,  reduces  the  complexity  surrounding  the  management  of 
concomitant medications via labelling, guidance and education that would need to be provided for 
each CYP2D6 phenotypic subgroup. Nevertheless, it should be considered that in the ENCORE study 
about  48 %  of  patients  received  eliglustat  150  mg  BID.  Further  about  20%  received  50  mg  BID, 
leaving  32%  of  the  patient  treated  with  the  proposed  100mg  BID.  The  variation  in  treatment 
regimens was the result of individual dose titration in the ENCORE and ENGAGE studies. Additional 
analysis of the ENCORE study results showed that the thresholds used to titrate the dose individually 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 56/75 
 
 
 
 
did  not  hold.  Below  the  lower  efficacy  margin  (5  ng/ml)  patients  were  identified  with  acceptable 
efficacy. The  upper safety limit (150 ng/ml) could be raised to 500 ng/ml based on the QT study 
results. 
The popPK/PD model showed a relation between AUC and effect on spleen volume. Using this model 
it can be calculated that the expected loss of efficacy in patients treated with 100 mg bid (IM and EM 
patients) or 100mg QD (PM patients) is clinically negligible. This is justified by the actual data that do 
not show a difference between EM patients treated with 100 or 150 mg BID. Notwithstanding, a 
considerable portion of the patients falls without the 95% CI of the PopPK predictions, therefore the 
Patients should be closely monitored and in case of deterioration other treatment options should be 
considered. This is included in the SmPC. 
The initial exclusion of PM and URM from the proposed indication was also questioned by the CHMP. 
During the procedure physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations were conducted by 
the applicant, the outcome of these simulations lead to a recommendation for dosing in PM patients. 
In PM patients, a dosing regimen of 100mg QD is advised. In addition the CHMP recommended the 
submission of a full report including the underlying data of the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic 
(PBPK) simulations conducted to support the dose recommendation in PM patients to be provided 
post-authorisation. 
For the URM the Cmax using a 150 mg BID regimen is 22.6 (24.3) ng/ml (mean [SD]). It is therefore 
to be expected that URM patients will have some benefit from treatment with eliglustat. This is further 
strengthened  by  the  observation  that  in  some  patients  benefit  from  Ctrough  levels  below  5ng/ml. 
Despite  this  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  available  data  for  URMs  are  currently  too  limited  to  draw 
definite conclusions. The applicant agreed to collect more data in patients who are CYP2D6 URM and 
PM post-authorisation. A comprehensive review of the data on PMs and URMs including analysis of the 
data from additional 5 PM patients and 4 URM patients from the extension periods of the Phase 2 
study, ENGAGE and ENCORE, as well as the EDGE study together with the PKPB simulations will be 
provided post-authorisation and was included in the RMP.   
Results in Sub-Populations 
Efficacy  results  were  analysed  by  gender,  age  group,  race,  baseline  disease  severity,  and  GD 
genotype. Some small, clinically insignificant differences were noted in the studies. 
Comparison of Efficacy Results with Currently Approved Therapies 
In the ICGG Gaucher Registry analyses, selection criteria based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
from ENGAGE and the Phase 2 study were used to select imiglucerase-treated patients from the ICGG 
Gaucher  Registry  who  had  received  at  least  15  U/kg/2  weeks  for  comparison  with  visceral, 
haematological,  and  skeletal  outcomes.  The  registry  analysis  showed  that  the  visceral  and 
haematological  changes  observed  with  eliglustat  treatment  in  treatment-naïve  patients  after  9 
months of treatment (in ENGAGE) and 4 years of treatment (in the Phase 2 study) were similar to 
those observed in imiglucerase-treated patients from the ICGG Gaucher Registry (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Comparison of efficacy data of eliglustat (Phase 2 data) with Imiglucerase (Data 
from ICGG Gaucher Registry; matched) 
Eliglustat and imiglucerase were compared directly in ENCORE, which studied maintenance of stability 
in patients who had already reached pre-specified therapeutic goals with ERT. Results from this study 
demonstrated that eliglustat is an efficacious agent in maintaining stability in GD1 patients who have 
reached therapeutic goals with ERT. However the applicant proposes a different dosing regimen in the 
SmPC. The proposed regimen is not considered non inferior to the ERT in terms of maintenance in the 
opinion of the CHMP but the data indicate that the majority of the patients are adequately treated with 
a  minority  showing  insufficient  response.  These  patients  should  be  identified  based  on  clinical 
observations and other treatment which may be more beneficial to the particular individual should be 
considered (ERT).  
Miglustat  is  the  only  currently  approved  treatment  with  a  comparable  mode  of  action.  It  is  a 
second-line therapy indicated in adult patients with mild to moderate GD1 for whom  ERT is not a 
therapeutic  option.  Results  obtained  with  miglustat  in  treatment  naïve  patients  showed  a  mean 
reduction  in  liver  volume  of  17.5%  after  36  months.  The  mean  reduction  in  spleen  volume  from 
baseline was 29.6% after 36 months. Also after 36 months treatment increase in mean haemoglobin 
concentration from baseline was 0.95 g/dl. At 36 months, the mean increase in mean platelet count 
in  patients  remaining  on  therapy  was  22.2x109/l.  However,  eliglustat  is  approximately  1000-fold 
more  potent  for  its  target  than  miglustat  (Platt,  1994,  J  Biol  Chem;  McEachern,  2007,  Mol  Genet 
Metab)  and  although  only  an  indirect  comparison  is  possible,  the  results  obtained  with  eliglustat 
appear more beneficial than those reported for miglustat in the treatment naïve patients. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It can be concluded that eliglustat constitutes a treatment option for GD patients in the treatment 
naïve patients given the clinically meaningful changes observed. 
Although, based on the aggregate data from all doses tested in this study, eliglustat met the criteria 
set in this study to be declared non-inferior to imiglucerase in maintaining patient stability, based on 
strict statistics, the pre-specified primary analysis has an inflated type I error, therefore does not 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 58/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fulfill the regulatory requirements. The CHMP considered that the noninferiority with a margin of -20% 
was not comprehensively demonstrated. Still, the CHMP agreed that eliglustat can be considered an 
alternative for imiglucerase in stabilized patients when needed for the clinical results in most patients 
(over  80%)  are  comparable  irrespective  of  treatment.  Nevertheless,  the  recommendation  was 
included in the SmPC that in case of insufficient effectiveness with eliglustat alternative treatment 
options (ERT) should be considered. 
The initial exclusion of PM and URM from the proposed indication was questioned by the CHMP. During 
the  procedure  physiologically-based  pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  simulations  were  conducted,  the 
outcome  of  which  was  submitted  to  the  CHMP  and  lead  to  a  possible  dosing  for  PM  patients.  For 
patients who are PM a dosing regimen of 100mg QD is advised. In addition the CHMP recommended 
the submission of a full report with the underlying data of the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic 
(PBPK)  simulations  conducted  to  the  support  the  dose  recommendation  in  PM  patients 
post-authorisation.  
For the URM the Cmax using a 150 mg BID regimen is 22.6 (24.3) ng/ml (mean [SD]). It is therefore 
to be expected that URM patients will have some benefit from treatment with eliglustat. This is further 
strengthened  by  the  observation  that  in  some  patients  benefit  from  Cthrough  levels  below  5ng/ml. 
Despite  this  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  available  data  for  URMs  are  currently  too  limited  to  draw 
conclusions from. The applicant agreed to collect more data in patients who are CYP2D6 URM and PM 
post-authorisation. A comprehensive review of the data on PMs and URMs including analysis of the 
data from additional 5 PM patients and 4 URM patients from the extension periods of the Phase 2, 
ENGAGE  and  ENCORE,  as  well  as  the  EDGE  studies  together  with  the  PKPB  simulations  will  be 
provided post-authorisation.   
Furthermore, the CHMP recommended the development of the lower dosage strengths (21 and/or 42 
mg  eliglustat).  Also,  a  single-  and  multiple  dose  pharmacokinetics  study  in  healthy  subjects  is 
recommended to be conducted to characterize dose proportionality of 21, 42, and 84 mg eliglustat to 
accommodate various situations requiring further dosage adjustments. 
Based on the review of the efficacy data the CHMP was of the opinion that this oral treatment is a 
valuable addition to the treatment options for patients with GD type 1.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  pooled  Eliglustat  Safety  Set  contains  393  patients:  26  patients  from  the  Phase  2  study,  40 
patients from ENGAGE, 157 patients from ENCORE, and 170 patients from EDGE. Eliglustat safety 
data from both the PAPs and the Long-term Treatment Periods from ENGAGE and ENCORE up to the 
database  cut-off  date  (31  January  2013).  In  the  pooled  Eliglustat  Safety  Set,  the  mean  (±SD) 
duration of treatment was 1.4 (±1.19) years, and the total duration was 535.0 patient-years. The 
minimum and maximum exposure both occurred in the Phase 2 study. The minimum duration was <1 
day (2 patients received only one 50-mg dose), and maximum duration of treatment was 6.5 years. 
Adverse events 
Overall, 334/393 of eliglustat-treated patients (85%) experienced a TEAE (2,340 events; 437 events 
per  100  person-years).  Events  in  the  majority  of  patients  were  considered  unrelated  to  eliglustat 
treatment  by  the  Investigators  (312/334;  79%).  Most  of  the  TEAEs  experienced  were  mild  or 
moderate in severity (78% and 44% of patients, respectively), while 45 patients (11%) experienced 
68 TEAEs which were considered severe.

The  most  frequent  TEAEs  (those  occurring  in  ≥10%  of  all  patients  who  received  eliglustat)  were: 
Headache (17%), arthralgia (14%), nasopharyngitis (13%), upper respiratory tract infection (11%), 
diarrhoea  (10%),  and  dizziness  (10%).  The  proportions  of  patients  with  each  of  these  events 
decreased over time. In general, the most frequently affected SOCs and the most frequent Preferred 
Terms  (PTs)  were  similar  in  treatment-naïve  patients  (ENGAGE  and  Phase  2  study),  in  patients 
switching  from  ERT  (ENCORE),  and  in  the  pooled  patient  population  (including  the  EDGE  lead-in 
period), with some of the reported PTs in the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC 
also being known symptoms of GD (e.g. arthralgia and bone pain). 
A higher overall incidence of TEAEs was reported for eliglustat compared to imiglucerase, including 
TEAEs considered related to study drug by the investigator, but this result was not unexpected in this 
open-label  study,  considering  this  was  a  previously  treated  population  of  patients  who  had  been 
receiving  imiglucerase  for  a  mean  of  almost  10  years  prior  to  study  entry.  Most  AEs  related  to 
imiglucerase would have been expected to occur during the first few months of treatment. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No treatment-emergent deaths have been reported in the pooled eliglustat safety set through the 
database cut-off date of 31 January 2013. Across the programme, a total of 5 deaths were reported. 
In all cases, the events leading to the deaths were considered not related to eliglustat, and 3 of the 
deaths were not during treatment. Two patients in EDGE died while on eliglustat treatment (one due 
to multiple severe traumas following a downhill skiing accident after completion of the lead-in period, 
and  another  from  cardiac  arrest  due  to  haemorrhaging  and  massive  blood  loss  from  unspecified 
violence after the 31 Jan  2013 cut-off date and after completion of the lead-in period; both were 
considered unrelated to study drug treatment). 
A total of 42 SAEs  occurred in 35 patients (9%) in the Pooled Eliglustat Safety SetThe majority of 
SAEs  were  due  to  hospitalizations  for  intercurrent  illnesses  (e.g.,  appendicitis)  and  underlying 
diseases for which GD patients are at increased risk (e.g., femur fracture, joint dislocation [Deegan, 
2011, Medicine], hepatocellular carcinoma [Weinreb, 2013, Crit Rev Oncogen], and cholecystitis. 
The  most  frequently  reported  SAE  was  syncope  (5  patients).  The  serious  syncopal  events  were 
vasovagal in nature with predisposing risk factors (i.e., blood draw, fasting conditions and pain), and 
none of these events led to permanent discontinuation from the study. Unscheduled ECGs, obtained 
as part of post-event diagnostic testing, did not reveal any cardiac arrhythmias or increase in ECG 
intervals as the potential cause for these syncopal events. SAEs of Syncope were severe in 4 patients, 
and were considered at least possibly related to eliglustat in 3 patients. SAEs (other than syncope) 
occurring in more than one patient included myocardial infarction in 4 patients, one of which  was 
changed to Angina in late-breaking safety reports. All of these patients had pre-existing risk factors 
for myocardial infarction. In each case the investigator assessed these events as not related or as 
remote/unlikely related to eliglustat. 
Discontinuations 
A total of 12/393 patients (3%) had at least 1 TEAE that led to permanent discontinuation of eliglustat 
treatment. These events included ventricular tachycardia in 2 patients, 2 patients with myocardial 
infarction prior to the database cut-off of 31 Jan 2013 and another after this date, and other events 
occurring in one patient each. No pattern or trend was noted regarding the timing of these events 
relative to the start of study drug or time on treatment (the onset ranged from the day of first dose to 
382  days  after  the  first  dose).  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  eliglustat  discontinuation  and  study 
withdrawal  that  were  considered  possibly  or  probably  related  to  eliglustat  included  ventricular 
tachycardia; lethargy and exfoliative rash in the same patient; upper abdominal pain; palpitations; 
and nausea, headache, and anaemia in the same patient.

Clinical Laboratory Evaluations and Vital Signs 
Changes in hematology and chemistry laboratory parameters over time were small and no clinically 
relevant trends were observed. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful changes in mean vital sign 
measurements from Baseline to any post Baseline time point. 
A Phase 1 Thorough QT (TQT) study in healthy volunteers (GZGD01707) tested the effect of a single 
dose of 200 mg or 800 mg eliglustat on cardiac repolarization. The mean Cmax at the 200-mg dose was 
26.5 ng/mL (geometric mean 16.7 ng/mL); the maximum Cmax at the 200-mg dose was 142 ng/mL. 
The mean Cmax at the 800-mg dose was 299 ng/mL (geometric mean 237 ng/mL); the maximum Cmax 
was  761  ng/mL.  PR,  QRS,  and  QTcF  intervals  all  increased  from  Baseline  in  a  dose-dependent 
manner.  
The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the QTcF change from Baseline did not exceed 10 
msec at any time point at either the 200 mg or 800 mg dose, and therefore it was a negative study per 
ICH E14 guidance and at most a mild increase in QTcF at the supratherapeutic dose. The prolongation 
of PR (average 7 msec) at the higher dose is considered a mild increase. The small prolongation of the 
QRS (average 2 msec) at the higher dose is of unclear clinical significance. 
There is a concentration-dependent increase in QT, PR, and QRS intervals with increased eliglustat 
exposure.  However,  the  results  shown  above  demonstrate  that  even  at  an  eliglustat  Cmax  of  500 
ng/mL clinically significant ECG interval increases are not expected. This is higher than that expected 
with  therapeutic  doses  even  in  the  presence  of  concomitant  medications  inhibiting  CYP2D6  and 
CYP3A, To date, patients taking eliglustat on any of the regimens evaluated in the clinical trials have 
not had reported plasma levels in the range predicted to cause clinically meaningful changes in ECG 
intervals.  Furthermore,  there  were  no  clinically  significant  prolongations  of  the  QTcF,  PR,  or  QRS 
interval  observed  in  clinical  studies,  despite  extensive  ongoing  Holter  and  ECG  monitoring  in  the 
trials, and findings of cardiac conduction disorders did not appear to be outside of the published range 
of events in normal subjects. 
Safety in special populations 
CYP 2D6 status 
In the pooled Eliglustat Safety Set, no increase in the overall incidence of TEAEs was seen for patients 
identified as poor metabolizers (79%) compared with patients identified as intermediate metabolizers 
(73%). The proportions of patients in the poor and intermediate metabolizer groups who experienced 
TEAEs  at  any  dose  (79%  and  73%,  respectively)  was  lower  than  that  observed  for  extensive 
metabolizers (88%). 
Upper limit in clinical studies 
In the clinical studies an upper limit of 150ng/ml was defined. This upper limit was introduced based 
on very preliminary data and an abundance of caution. The QT study indicated that levels up to 500 
ng/ml can be considered safe from the QT perspective.  
Safety of drug-drug interactions 
Interactions have been studied and findings are sufficient worded in the SmPC. Besides some in vitro 
and  modelling  issues  which  need  to  be  clarified,  no  clinical  concerns  are  raised.  The  lack  of  the 
discussion is not further pursued.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As to be expected from an orphan drug the overall safety database is small (N= 393) and the duration 
of treatment is short (one year) for most patients with a selected group generating 4 years data.  
This is considered acceptable. Nevertheless, an obligation to set up and maintain a sub registry of the 
ICGG was agreed and is described in the RMP. This will allow collection of further safety data post 
authorisation.  
Eliglustat  was  generally  well  tolerated  across  the  clinical  programme.  Few  patients  (12/393,  3%) 
withdrew due to TEAEs. These events includedventricular tachycardia in 2 patients, 2 patients with 
myocardial infarction. The most frequent TEAEs (those occurring in ≥10% of all patients who received 
eliglustat) were: headache (17%), arthralgia (14%), nasopharyngitis (13%), upper respiratory tract 
infection  (11%),  diarrhoea  (10%),  and  dizziness  (10%).  The  gastrointestinal  AE’s  decreased  in 
time.  
Across  the  clinical  programme,  diarrhoea  was  reported  in  9%  of  eliglustat-treated  patients,  and 
weight  loss  in  <2%.  This  might  be  explained  by  the  observed  difference  in  binding  to  intestinal 
disaccharidase enzymes between miglustat and eliglustat. Compared to miglustat, the safety profile 
of eliglustat appears to be less severe, although direct comparison is lacking. The safety profile of 
patients  on  ERT,  in  particular  imiglucerase  was  different  (mainly  infusion  related  reactions  and 
antibody formation in case of imiglucerase). 
There were no treatment-emergent deaths in the pooled Eliglustat Safety Set. Across the programme, 
a total of 5 deaths were reported, and the events leading to the deaths were considered not related to 
eliglustat. A total of 42 SAEs have occurred in 35 patients (9%). The majority of SAEs reported were 
due to hospitalizations for intercurrent illnesses and underlying diseases for which Gaucher patients 
are  at  increased  risk.  SAEs  occurring  in  more  than  one  patient  included  myocardial  infarction  (4 
patients)  and  syncope  (5  patients).  Most  AE  were  mild  or  moderate  and  only  a  small  number  of 
patients withdrawn due to AE the adverse events profile of eliglustat can be considered acceptable.  
A  thorough  QT/QTc  study  in  healthy  volunteers  (GZGD01707)  did  not  reveal  clinically  relevant 
prolongations  of  QT  in  plasma  levels  below  the  500  ng/ml.  There  was  a  theoretical  concern 
considering  the  combination  of  bradycardia  and  adverse  events  possibly  related  to  a  decreased 
cardiac  output  (fatigue,  cough,  dizziness,  syncope  and  oedema).  Based  on  the  analysis  of  the 
available  data  a  causal  relation  of  bradycardia  and  eliglustat  could  not  be  established.  Further 
bradycardia was not associated with a decrease in cardiac output. No relation between various forms 
of arrhythmias and other conductive disorders and the use of eliglustat was established. The QT study 
further indicated that the QT prolongation is only relevant in patients with plasma levels above the 
500ng/ml, which are not reached in these studies. Due to the lack of detailed information on patients 
with pre-existing cardiac conditions the applicant included a warning in the SmPC section 4.4. to avoid 
treatment  with eliglustat in patients with cardiac disease, long QT syndrome and in combination with 
class IA and III antiarrhythmic medicinal products.   
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database is limited both with regards to the number of patients and time on treatment. 
This is acceptable and expected given the orphan nature of the disease. Particularly, drug related AEs 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 62/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
occurring  with  a  low  frequency  might  be  not  reported  yet.  Overall,  the  adverse  effects  profile  of 
eliglustat appears manageable. The AEs currently identified were mostly mild and reversible. Most 
remarkable  AEs  were  cardiovascular  disorders  including  syncope  and  palpitations,  infections 
predominately of the upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal disorders including diarrhoea, nervous 
system disorders, fatigue and asthenia. The available data allow no robust conclusion on long term 
safety. Based on the analysis of the available data from a causal relation of the observed bradycardia 
and eliglustat could not be established. Further bradycardia was not associated with a decrease in 
cardiac output. No relation between various forms of arrhythmias and other conductive disorders and 
the use of eliglustat could be established. 
 In conclusion, the  CHMP  agreed that the available safety data are sufficient but require a careful 
follow-up post authorisation to continue characterisation of the safety profile. 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address the long term safety profile in the 
context of a MA:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The effects of eliglustat were evaluated in three studies, a phase 2 study (GZGD00304) and 2 phases 
3 ENCORE, ENGAGE. ENGAGE (placebo controlled study) and the Phase 2 open, non-controlled study 
were designed to assess the ability of eliglustat to improve clinical manifestations in treatment naïve 
patients, whereas ENCORE (open, imiglucerase controlled study) assessed the ability of eliglustat to 
maintain the clinical status of patients who had stabilized on ERT.  
In treatment-naïve patients (ENGAGE), there was a statistically significant mean reduction in spleen 
volume between the eliglustat and placebo groups after 9 months (-30.03%; 95% CI -36.82 to -23.24; 
p <0.0001). Most (75%) of the eliglustat-treated patients achieved a clinically meaningful reduction 
of at least 20% in spleen volume compared to only 5% of placebo treated patients. In addition, all 
secondary  endpoints  showed  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  changes,  including 
absolute  change  in  haemoglobin  level  (1.22  g/dL;  p=0.0006),  percentage  change  in  liver  volume 
(-6.64%;  p=0.0072),  and  percentage  change  in  platelet  count  (41.06%;  p<0.0001).  In  the  open 
phase  2  study  statistically  significant  improvements  in  all  4  organs  volume  and  haematology 
parameters were observed at Week 52 and were maintained or continued to improve through Month 
48. 
In patients switching from ERT (ENCORE), the composite endpoint, indicating continuing stability of 
the  patient  (expressed  as  no  change  in  liver,  spleen,  haemoglobin  and  platelet  count),  was 
maintained in 85% of patients in the eliglustat group and 94% in the imiglucerase group after 52 
weeks of treatment. The lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between treatment groups 
(-17.6%) was within the pre-specified by the applicant non-inferiority margin of -25%.  
Other  endpoints  for  both  naïve  and  stabilized  patients  were:  biomarkers  (GL-1,  GM3,  ceramide, 
sphingomyelin), QoL and bone mineral density. These clinical measures represent the more common 
manifestations  of  GD  that  may  be  responsive  to  treatment  in  the  short  term,  and  have  been 
investigated in previous studies of ERT or SRT in patients with GD1. The results obtained with these 
endpoints  support  the  results  observed  for  the  primary  endpoints  and  most  important  secondary 
endpoints. 
Efficacy results were analysed by gender, age group, race, baseline disease severity, geographical 
location and GD genotype. Some small, clinically insignificant differences were noted in the studies. 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from healthy subjects and GD1 patients showed 
that CYP2D6 phenotype (PM, IM, EM, or URM) was the most significant determinant of exposure to 
eliglustat.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Based on strict statistics, the unstratified Agresti-Caffo method in the ENCORE study has an inflated 
type  I  error,  therefore  does  not  fulfil  the  regulatory  requirements.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the 
statement  that  eliglustat  is  non-inferior  to  ERT  (imiglucerase)  was  not  comprehensively 
demonstrated.  The  SmPC  was  updated  to  mention  the  higher  failure  rate  compared  to  ERT:  the 
defined disease stability criterion in the composite endpoint including haemoglobin and platelet values 
and spleen and liver volumes was maintained in only 84.8% of patients on eliglustat compared to 
94% on imiglucerase after 52 weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints showed a similar trend. 
In practice this means that the majority of the patients can switch to eliglustat without loss of efficacy. 
A minority of patients (about 15%) does not remain stable on eliglustat and should receive alternative 
therapy.

The number of patients in the clinical development was 393. This relatively small number of patients 
exposed led to broad variations of the various endpoints and reduced the sensitivity of the studies. 
Notwithstanding  this  low  sensitivity,  statistically  significant  results  were  obtained  for  the  primary 
endpoints.  
The currently proposed fixed posology for IM and EM patients (100 mg BID) and PM patients (100 mg 
QD) is different from the exposure adjusted one used in pivotal studies and is based on popPK/PD 
studies for IMs/EMs and modelling of PBPK data for PMs. Further analysis in EM patients showed that 
the fixed dose regimen can be used without the risk of under treatment in the majority of the patients. 
Therefore, eliglustat is indicated in PM, IM and EM patients using a single dosing regimen of 100 mg 
BID (IM and EM patients) or 100 mg QD (PM patients). 
Before initiation of treatment with Cerdelga, patients should be genotyped for CYP2D6 to determine 
the  CYP2D6  metaboliser  status.  However,  genotyping  for  CYP2D6  is  generally  available  in  the 
specialised centres that treat GD patients and the test can be performed in most hospitals.  
Only about 3% of the GD population are URM and are excluded currently from the treatment with 
eliglustat. The efficacy in  this subgroup can only be estimated by using PK modelling and in  vitro 
studies and not by a direct interpretation of efficacy results. A higher dosage of 150 mg of eliglustat 
or more may be required as indicated by the observed plasma levels in these patients. Further data in 
URM patients are required to be provided post-marketing. This is reflected in the agreed RMP.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The pooled Eliglustat Safety Set consists of 393 patients. In the pooled Eliglustat Safety Set, the mean 
(±SD) duration of treatment was 1.4 (±1.19) years, and the total duration was 535.0 patient-years. 
Overall, 334/393 of eliglustat-treated patients (85%) experienced a TEAE (2,340 events; 437 events 
per  100  person-years).  The  most  frequent  TEAEs  (those  occurring  in  ≥10%  of  all  patients  who 
received  eliglustat)  were:  headache  (17%),  arthralgia  (14%),  nasopharyngitis  (13%),  upper 
respiratory tract infection (11%), diarrhoea (10%), and dizziness (10%). The proportions of patients 
with each of these events decreased over time.  
Eliglustat is a substrate of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and P-gp. Inhibition of these pathways may lead to a 
9-fold  increase  in  eliglustat  exposure.  Moreover,  simultaneous  inhibition  of  the  CYP2D6  and  3A4 
pathway may lead even up to a 25-fold increase in exposure, which may raise a safety concern. In 
addition,  due  to  induction  exposure  may  be  about  95%  decreased,  which  may  lead  to  efficacy 
problems.  
No unfavourable clinically relevant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed. 
A Phase 1 Thorough QT study in healthy volunteers tested the effect of a single dose of 200 mg or 800 
mg eliglustat on cardiac repolarization. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the QTcF 
change from baseline did not exceed 10 msec at any time point at either the 200 mg or 800 mg dose, 
and therefore this study was considered negative according to the ICH E14 Guidance. 
In the pooled Eliglustat Safety Set, no increase in the overall incidence of TEAEs was seen for patients 
identified as PM (79%) compared with patients identified as IM (73%). The proportions of patients in 
the poor and intermediate metabolizer groups who experienced TEAEs at any dose (79% and 73%, 
respectively) were lower than that observed for extensive metabolizers (88%). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Given eliglustat is an orphan medicinal product the overall safety database is small (N= 393) and the 
duration of treatment is short (one year) for most patients with a selected group generating 4 years 
Cerdelga

data. An adequate RMP to gain sufficient safety information after registration was agreed during the 
procedure.   
The combination of bradycardia and adverse reactions like  fatigue, cough, dizziness, syncope and 
oedema  could  be  possibly  related  to  a  decreased  cardiac  output.  Analysis  of  the  available  data 
indicates that a causal relation of the observed bradycardia and eliglustat could not be established. 
Further bradycardia was not associated with a decrease in cardiac output. No relation between various 
forms of arrhythmias and other conductive disorders and the use of eliglustat could be established.  
Due to the lack of detailed information on patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions a warning in 
the SmPC section 4.4. was included to avoid treatment with eliglustat in patients with cardiac disease, 
long QT syndrome and in combination with class IA and III antiarrhythmic medicinal products.   
The  safety  data  in  PMs  are  limited.  Dose  recommendation  is  based  on  popPK/PBPK  analysis  and 
further safety data from the sub-registry of ICGG and from the extension studies (ENGAGE, ENCORE 
and EDGE) are to be provided post-authorisation.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The main endpoints in pivotal studies were changes in liver and spleen volume, haemoglobin level and 
platelet count. Other endpoints were biomarkers (GL-1, GM3, ceramide, sphingomyelin), quality of 
life (QoL) and bone mineral density and these endpoints are considered “surrogate endpoints” for 
treatment  although  no  formal  relation  with  the  clinical  importance  or  patients  perceived 
improvements was demonstrated.  
In  the  phase  3  ENGAGE  study,  most  (75%)  of  the  treatment-naïve  eliglustat-treated  patients 
achieved a clinically meaningful reduction of at least 20% in spleen volume compared to only 5% of 
placebo treated patients. Comparable changes were observed in all secondary endpoints. In the open 
phase  2  study  statistically  significant  improvements  in  all  4  organ  volume  and  haematology 
parameters were observed at Week 52 and were maintained or continued to improve through Month 
48. 
In the phase 3 ENCORE study, the composite endpoint (indicating stabilisation) was maintained in 
85%  of  patients  in  the  eliglustat  group  and  94%  in  the  imiglucerase  group  after  52  weeks  of 
treatment. The lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between treatment groups (-17.6%) was 
within  the  pre-specified  non-inferiority  margin  of  -25%,  but  not  within  the  -20%  non-inferiority 
margin, that was advised by CHMP via the scientific advice procedure, for all methods that may have 
been considered a reasonable choice for the primary analysis method at time of planning of the study. 
These  findings  were  considered  clinically  important.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
statement  that  eliglustat  is  non-inferior  to  ERT  (imiglucerase)  has  not  been  comprehensively 
demonstrated.  However,  the  demonstrated  superiority  over  placebo  and  the  ease  of  the 
orally-administered  treatment  (as  compared  to  ERT)  justifies  eliglustat  as  a  first  line  treatment. 
Patients who fail to reach accepted treatment goals or maintain a stabilisation need to be identified 
and  other  treatment  options  should  be  considered.  The  SmPC  gives  a  recommendation  for  the 
identification  of the  above  mentioned  patients.  The  reversibility  of  the  deterioration  in  ERT  stable 
patients further concur with this approach. 
In  study  GZGD02607  (ENCORE)  the  majority  of  patients  (48%)  received  eliglustat  150  mg  BID. 
Therefore some concerns were raised regarding “under treatment” with the proposed fixed dosing of 
100 mg BID. Analysis using the popPK/PD model showed that there is a relation between AUC and 
effect on spleen volume. Using this model it can be calculated that the loss of efficacy is clinically 
negligible in patients switching from 150 mg BID to 100 mg BID. This conclusion is justified by the 
actual  data  that  do  not  show  a  difference  between  EM  patients  treated  with  100  or  150  mg  BID. 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015

However, a considerable portion of patients falls outside the 95% CI of the popPK model, therefore 
the patients should be monitored closely and in case of deterioration other treatment options should 
be considered.  
In most patients efficacy of eliglustat appears comparable to ERT, with a different safety profile, both 
in treatment-naïve patients and in patients switching from ERT. The oral route of administration for 
the eliglustat capsules can be considered more convenient than the iv administration of imiglucerase.  
Safety profile was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The most frequent TEAEs (those occurring in 
≥10%  of  all  patients  who  received  eliglustat)  were:  headache  (17%),  arthralgia  (14%), 
nasopharyngitis  (13%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (11%),  diarrhoea  (10%),  and  dizziness 
(10%). The proportions of patients with each of these events decreased over time. 
There were no treatment-emergent deaths in the pooled Eliglustat Safety Set as of 31 January 2013. 
Across the programme, a total of 5 deaths were reported, and the events leading to the deaths were 
considered  not  related  to  eliglustat.  A  total  of  42  SAEs  have  occurred  in  35  patients  (9%).  The 
majority  of  SAEs  reported  were  due  to  hospitalizations  for  intercurrent  illnesses  and  underlying 
diseases for which Gaucher disease patients are at increased risk. SAEs occurring in more than one 
patient  included  myocardial  infarction  (4  patients)  and  syncope  (5  patients).  Number  of 
discontinuations was low (3%). 
A  thorough  QT/QTc study  in  healthy  volunteers  (GZGD01707)  did  not  reveal  clinically  relevant 
prolongations of QT. There remains, however, a theoretical concern considering the combination of 
bradycardia and adverse reactions possibly related to a decreased cardiac output (fatigue, cough, 
dizziness, syncope and oedema). After analysis of the available data a causal relation of the observed 
bradycardia  and  eliglustat  could  not  established.  Further  bradycardia  was  not  associated  with  a 
decrease in cardiac output. No relation between various forms of arrhythmias and other conductive 
disorders and the use of eliglustat could be established.  
Due to the lack of detailed information on patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions a warning was 
added to the SmPC. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy of eliglustat in the treatment of GD, both in treatment-naïve patients and patients who 
are switched from ERT has been demonstrated with clinically relevant effects. Eliglustat is generally 
well tolerated and its safety profile is considered acceptable.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considered that the statement that eliglustat is non-inferior to ERT (imiglucerase) was not 
comprehensively  demonstrated.  However  the  benefit-risk  of  eliglustat  in  treatment  experienced 
patients  is  considered  positive.  The  PI  is  updated  to  mention  the  somewhat  higher  failure  rate 
compared  to  ERT  and  the  percentages  of  patients  meeting  the  primary  composite  endpoint  on 
eliglustat and imiglucerase in the ENCORE study are reflected in the SmPC. 
The majority of patients (48%) in the ENCORE study received eliglustat 150 mg BID. Based on an 
analysis using the popPK/PD model it can be calculated that the loss of efficacy is clinically negligible 
in most patients switching from 150 mg BID to 100 mg BID. This conclusion is justified by the actual 
data that do not show a difference in response between EM patients treated with 100 or 150 mg/ml.  
However, still a considerable proportion of the patients (15%) showed  sub-optimal clinical results 
(less than 20% improvement in treatment naïve patient) after nine months of treatment. For these 
patients an alternative treatment modality should be considered. For patients with stable disease who 
switch  from  ERT  to  eliglustat,  close  monitoring  for  disease  progression  (e.g.  at  least  at  6  months 
Cerdelga  
EMA/68065/2015  
Page 72/75 
 
 
 
 
interval)  should  be  performed  for  all  disease  domains  to  evaluate  disease  stability.  In  case  of 
deterioration, reinstitution of ERT should be considered in line with a warning included in the SmPC. 
The MAH also made a commitment to design a sub-registry for the follow-up of the patients. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Cerdelga is not similar to Vpriv within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Cerdelga in the long-term treatment of adult patients with Gaucher 
disease type 1 (GD1), who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs), intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or 
extensive metabolisers (EMs) is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal  product  subject  to  restricted  medical  prescription  (see  Annex  I:  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Cerdelga in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Cerdelga is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals who are expected to prescribe Cerdelga are provided with a prescriber guide.  
The prescriber guide shall contain the following key elements: 
o  Cerdelga is indicated for the long-term treatment of adult patients with Gaucher disease type 1 
(GD1). It is not intended to be used in patients with Gaucher disease type 2 or type 3 (GD2 or 
GD3). 
o  Before initiation of treatment with Cerdelga, patients should be genotyped for CYP2D6 to 
determine the CYP2D6 metaboliser status. Cerdelga is indicated in patients who are CYP2D6 poor 
metabolisers (PMs), intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive metabolisers (EMs). 
o  The recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat twice daily in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) 
and extensive metabolisers (EMs). The recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat once daily in CYP2D6 
poor metabolisers (PMs).  
o  Patients should be informed that consumption of grapefruit or its juice should be avoided 
o  Eliglustat is contraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 Intermediate Metabolisers or Extensive 
Metabolisers who are taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a strong or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitor.  Eliglustat is also contraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 poor 
metabolisers taking a strong CYP3A inhibitor. Use of eliglustat under these conditions results in 
substantially elevated plasma concentrations of eliglustat. This may cause mild increases in the PR, 
QRS, and QTc intervals. 
o  Use of eliglustat with strong CYP3A inducers substantially decreases the exposure to eliglustat, 
which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness; therefore concomitant administration is not 
recommended. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Cerdelga is marketed, all patients who are 
prescribed Cerdelga are provided with a patient alert card. The patient alert card shall contain the 
following key elements: 
Information for healthcare professionals: 
o  This patient is using eliglustat (Cerdelga) for the treatment of Gaucher Disease type 1.  
o  Eliglustat should not be used concomitantly with medicines that may have an impact on liver 
enzymes that play a role in the metabolism of eliglustat.  
o  Using eliglustat together with such products may either make eliglustat less effective, or it may 
increase the eliglustat levels in the patient’s blood.  
Information for the patient: 
o  Always consult the doctor who prescribed eliglustat before you start using other medicines  
o  Do not consume grapefruit products.

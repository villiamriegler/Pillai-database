1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Genzyme Europe BV submitted  on 26 October 2021 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the  European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Xenpozyme, through the  centralised 
procedure falling within  the Article 3(1) and point 4  of Annex of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004.  The 
eligibility to  the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/ CHMP  on 18  May 2017.   
Xenpozyme, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/01/056  on 19 September 2001  in 
the following condition:   
‘Treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type B’ 
On 20 July 2016,  Sanofi Genzyme submitted an application to broaden the orphan designation initially 
granted from the treatment  of Niemann-Pick disease type B (NPD B) to the  treatment of Acid 
Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD). The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) accepted 
broadening the  orphan designation to “treatment  of Niemann-Pick Disease”, i.e., Niemann-Pick Disease 
including subtypes A, B, and C. The COMP opinion acknowledge d that  NPD Type C is a different disease 
than NPD Types A and B and cannot be treated with  olipudase alfa. 
Following  the CHMP positive opinion on this ma rketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Xenpozyme as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in  the Orphan 
maintenance assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website:   
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Xenpozyme   
The applicant initially applied for the  following indication: 
Xenpozyme (olipudase alfa) is indicated as a disease -modifying enzyme replacement therapy for long-
term treatment of non-Central Nervous System (CNS) manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase 
Deficiency (ASMD) in  paediatric and adult patients. 
The final applied indication  was as follows: 
Xenpozyme is indicated as an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non -Central Nervous 
System (CNS) manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD) in paediatric and adult 
patients with  type A/B or type B. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC  - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, co mplete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting  certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006,  the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0459/2020,  on the agreement of a paediatric investigation  plan (PIP).  
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 6/136 
 
 
 
 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0459/2020  was not  yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000  and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the applicant  did not submit a critical report a ddressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant  requested accelerated assessment in  accordance to Article  14  (9)  of Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004. 
1.5.2.  New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance olipudase alfa contained in the  above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it  is not a constituent  of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within  the European Union.  
1.6.  PRIME 
Olipudase alfa was granted eligibility to PRIME on 18 May 2017 in  the following indication: treatment  of 
non-neurological manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD). 
Eligibility  to PRIME was granted at  the time in view of the  following: 
•  ASMD is rare disease with  high morbidity and mortality rates. No authorized, aetiology -specific 
treatment that  modifies aspects of the disease or alters the rate of disease progression exists. 
Available treatment focuses on symptomatic management with  palliative and supportive care. 
In line with  the non-CNS distribution  of the  product, the highest potential  o f clinical benefit can 
be expected for patients  with chronic visceral forms of ASMD.  
•  Olipudase alfa is a biologically plausible enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Data derived in an 
ASMKO mouse model provide proof of principle in relevant animal model.   
• 
• 
The preliminary clinical data presented support the assumption of biochemical and clinically 
relevant activity and therefore the ability to address the  unmet medical need.   
Increased breakdown and reduced storage of sphingomyelin has been shown for up to 30 
months. 
•  Consistent long-term reductions in spleen and liver volumes, transaminases, improvement in 
pulmonary function  (DLCO) and pulmonary morphology, improvement of lung infiltration  and a 
less atherogenic lipid profile suggesting  potential clinical benefit in patients with  ASMD.   
Upon granting of eligibility to  PRIME, Johann Lodewijk Hillege was appointed by the CHMP as 
rapporteur.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication initially applied for is: 
Xenpozyme (olipudase alfa) is indicated as a disease -modifying enzyme replacement therapy for long-
term treatment of non-Central Nervous System (CNS) manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase 
Deficiency (ASMD) in  paediatric and adult patients. 
The final applied indication  was as follows: 
Xenpozyme is indicated as an enzyme replacement therapy for the  treatment of non-Central Nervous 
System (CNS) manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD) in paediatric and adult 
patients with  type A/B or type B. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), formerly known as Niemann  Pick disease type A (NPD A) 
and type B (NPD B), is a rare lysosomal storage disorder resulting from deficiency of the  lysosomal 
enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) due to  bi-allelic mutations  in the sphingomyelin 
phosphodiesterase 1 gene, smpd1 (Schuchman et al., 2013;  Schuchman and Desnick, 2017).  ASMD is 
an autosomal recessive single gene-disease. Niemann Pick C Disease (NPD C) is distinct  from AMSD 
type A and B as it  has a different molecular pathway. NPD C cannot be treated with  olipudase alfa and 
the indication  is not  applied.  
In a systematic review of birth prevalence studies, based on data from ASMD types A and B patients 
referred to biochemical testing  facilities, the birth prevalence  per 100.000  life-births was reported as 
0.4 in  Australia, 0.53  in the Netherlands, 0.6 in  Northern Portugal, 0.33 in Czech republic, and 0.25  in 
the United  Arab Emirates (Kingma et al., 2015);  placing the birth  incidence of ASMD at  about 0.4 to 
0.6 per 100.000  births.  
There are more than 180 mutations  of the ASM gene (smpd1) described (Mc  Govern et al., 2017). In 
the Ashkenazi Jewish population, the  only population  that performs DNA -based screening, the carrier 
frequency of the 3 common pathogenic variants (L302P, R496L,  fsP330) known to cause ASMD type A 
is 1 in 90 individuals, corresponding to  a birth  prevalence of about 3 per 100.000  (Schuchman and 
Miranda, 1997;  Schuchman et al., 2015).  In non-Jewish populations, the  prevalence of ASMD type A is 
unknown (Acuna et al., 2016).  Estimates extrapolated from the  results of carrier screening suggest 
that  the true incidence may be higher in select populations, with  a higher incidence of ASMD type A 
phenotype among persons with  Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry . The birth prevalence for type A patients is 
0.25  per 100 000  (Schuchman and Wasserstein, 2015; McGovern et  al., 2017; Simonaro et al., 2002; 
Orphanet series).  
For chronic forms of ASMD (type B), several factors contribute to  the absence of accurate estimates of 
the prevalence, including under-diagnosis related to poor access to enzyme testing, misdiagnosis due 
to the high  degree of variability in presenting symptoms, and/or lack of knowledge about chronic forms 
of ASMD in the  clinical community (Schuchman and Wasserstein, 2015;  Kingman et al., 2015; 
Simonara et al., 2002).  The Orphanet survey estimated the prevalence of chronic forms of ASMD (type 
B) as 0.4  per 100.000  individuals (Orphanet series). The highest frequencies of chronic forms of ASMD 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 11/136 
 
 
 
 
have been reported in individuals of Turkish, Arabic, and North  African descent, although the  disorder 
affects many other distinct  populations (Simonara et al., 2002).   
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
ASMD results primarily in  the progressive accumulation of sphingomyelin within  the  mononuclear 
phagocytic system and hepatocytes and manifests as a multi-system disease involving the spleen, 
liver, lung,  bone marrow, and lymph nodes. In severe forms of the disease (ASMD type A), the CNS 
and peripheral nervous system are affected as well.  While the same metabolic defect is common to all 
ASMD patients,  disease severity is determined by the presence or absence of neurological involvement, 
the extent of systemic disease, and the rate of disease progression, resulting in  a wide spectrum of 
clinical manifestations. Infantile neurovisceral ASMD [Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPD A)] is the 
most severe form and is rapidly progressive and uniformly fatal in early childhood  (McGovern et al., 
2006).  More slowly, progressive, chronic, neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate, NPD A/B, NPD B variant) 
and chronic visceral ASMD (NPD B) have onset of symptoms in childhood through adulthood and are 
associated with  significant morbidity (McGovern et al., 2017),  and reduced life expectancy due to 
respiratory and/or liver disease (Cassiman et al., 2016;  McGovern et al., 2013).   
ASM catalyses the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphocholine . Reduced ASM activity 
results in the progressive lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin mostly  within  cells of the 
monocyte/macrophage lineage that reside in  reticuloendothelial tissues, namely in the spleen, liver, 
lung, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. With severe disease, neurons may also be affected. The de -
acylated form of sphingomyelin, lyso-sphingomyelin (LSM),  is a potential biomarker for this disease. 
The framework of using lyso-sphingolipids as a biomarker has been successfully applied to  other 
sphingolipidoses, such as Fabry disease (lysoGB3) and Gaucher disease (LysoGL1) (Polo et al., 2017).

Sphingolipids diffuse and switch between the membranes of lysosomes and the Golgi. Diseases corresponding  to the 
accumulation of the adjacent  substrate are reported in  purple. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Presentation 
Pulmonary involvement 
Pulmonary involvement, mainly interstitial  lung disease (ILD), occurs in all three types of ASMD but 
most frequently in type B. It is also associated with  recurrent respiratory tract infections (Cox et al., 
2018)  and progressive decline in pulmonary function, which  are major contributors to decreased QoL 
and disease burden in  ASMD patients (von Ranke et al., 2016;  Freitas et al., 2017;  McGovern et al., 
2013;  Iaselli et al., 2017). 
ILD may be diagnosed in newborns to adults in their late 40s ,  may precede ASMD diagnosis or may 
develop during follow-up (Guillemot et al., 2007;  Capron et al,. 2019).  Up to  42% of patients report 
shortness of breath at ASMD diagnosis (Acuna et al., 2016).  The clinical ILD presentation varies from 
asymptomatic involvement to respiratory failure with  no association with  organomegaly (Hollak  et al., 
2012);  however, the accumulation of Niemann–Pick cells in the alveolar septa and bronchial walls 
potentially leads to progressive respiratory insufficiency (Guillemot et al., 2007).  Foam cell infiltrates of 
the pulmonary alveoli block oxygen uptake through the  alveolar wall into the  blood vessels. This 
abnormal diffusing capacity is consistent with  ILD (Mendelson et al., 2006),  which  may manifest with 
coughing, shortness of breath, and recurrent respiratory infections. With  low partial pressure of oxygen 
(PO2) values, patients are affected by dyspnoea upon exertion. 
Almost 90% of patients with  ASMD-B exhibit ILD on CT scan (Mendelson et al., 2006).   
There is a poor correlation between the  extent of radiological abnormalities and pulmonary function 
test changes; however, both tests  are needed for diagnosis (Mendelson et al., 2006).  In a cohort of 55 
patients with  ASMD-B, half presented a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function  testing (mean FVC 
82% predicted). Almost 75% of patients with  ASMD-B present impaired DLCO (mean DLCO 60% 
predicted). In addition, mean values for FVC and DLCO are lower in patients  who are <18  than >18 
years old (McGovern et al., 2008).  Hypoxaemia is frequent and may be observed in up to 85% of 
patients (Guillemot et  al., 2007). 
A retrospective study of 29  paediatric and adult patients  with ASMD -B with a mean follow-up of 4.3 
years documented the  slow progression of pulmonary disease. The mean decline per year of forced 
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), FVC and DLCO was −1.6%, −0.1%  and −0.4% predicted, respectively 
McGovern et al., 2008).  In another series of 10 paediatric patients with  ASMD -B, all showed 
respiratory symptoms and three required long-term oxygen therapy (Guillemot et al., 2007). 
Liver fibrosis and, finally, cirrhosis occur in the  natural course of ASMD (Pinto et al., 2004;  McGovern 
et al., 2013;  Cassiman et al., 2016).  Therefore, elevated serum transaminases may be noted. Serum 
bilirubin concentrations are commonly normal, except for children who could present with  cholestatic 
liver disease (Pinto  et al., 2004). 
Linear growth and weight gain are progressively impaired o ver time in patients with  chronic disease, 
with  linear growth  below normal for greater than 50% of patients with  chronic visceral disease at age 
5 years and older (Cox et  al., 2018). et al.

Dyslipidaemia is a common feature of patients with  ASMD, even at a very early age.3,15,17 (Mc 
Govern et al., 2017). 
Developmental delay, developmental regression, and learning disabilities are reported for 40%  of 
patients with  chronic neurovisceral ASMD and are less common in patients with  chronic visceral ASMD 
(21%,  2%, and 13%, respectively) (Cox et al., 2018). 
Diagnosis 
Patients with  ASMD present with  a large phenotypic spectrum of nonspecific disease manifestations 
that  can lead to considerable diagnostic delay and missed cases. Demonstration of missing or 
significantly diminished enzyme activity remains the proof of the presence of the disease, especially in 
view of the  many unique mutations  or genetic variants of unknown significance. Results from other 
clinical and laboratory assessments, such as the presence of  characteristic lipid-laden foam cells 
present in the liver, spleen, airways, and bone marrow, together with  low platelet levels and mixed 
dyslipidaemia (low HDL  cholesterol with  high levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), although 
highly suggestive of ASMD, are not substitutes  for the need to  obtain confirmatory enzyme test results 
(McGovern et al., 2017). 
Following  biochemical and molecular analyses to confirm the  diagnosis of ASMD, predictions of 
phenotypic outcomes will  permit more appropriate patient  care and family counselling. Physicians will 
rely on clinical assessments to predict the phenotype and clinical course for paediatric patients when 
smpd1 mutations of unknown pathogenicity are identified (McGovern et al., 2017). 
Prognosis 
Several natural history studies and case report series consistently demonstrate that  ASMD is 
associated with  significant pulmonary morbidity and mortality. 
The median life expectancy for the  chronic visceral end of the  ASMD spectrum has been reported as 1 7 
years with  a range of 1 to  72 years (McGovern et al., 2013;  Cassiman et al., 2016).  Patients infantile 
neurovisceral end of the ASMD spectrum (type A) do not survive beyond the third  year of life 
(Schuchman and Wasserstein, 2015).  In these patients,  both rapidly fatal lung  disease and progressive 
pulmonary disease leading to lung failure have been reported (Guillemot  et al., 2007).   
The primary causes of death in patients with  chronic visceral ASMD (type B) were respiratory (32.1%) 
and liver (26.4%)  disease, which together accounted for the  majority of deaths. By definition,  there 
were no deaths due to neurodegenerative disease in patients  with  chronic visceral ASMD. For  patients 
with  chronic neurovisceral ASMD (type A), respiratory disease (23.1%),  neurodegeneration (23.1%), 
and liver disease (19.2%)  were the primary causes of death (Cassiman  et al., 2016, McGovern et  al., 
2013). 
2.1.5.  Management 
There is no aetiology-specific treatment that  can modify the disease or slow the rate of progression. 
Patients can only be provided palliative and supportive care for managing symptomology.   
Reduction of hepatosplenomegaly and consequentially correcting haematological and lipid 
abnormalities and improving respiratory status may improve patient  outcome.  
For the treatment  of the underlying disease symptoms, the following interventions  are used: for 
neutropenia: antibiotic (typically penicillin or azithromycin), with GI track disturbances and risk of 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 14/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resistance; for lung capacity: inhalators (cortisone, broncho-dilatators); for bone density: calcium; for 
thrombocytopenia: fresh plasma; for high cholesterol: very high doses statins and low -fat  diet (EMA 
patient consultation).  Although  statins are used, they do not fully correct the abnormal lipid profile 
(i.e., low concentration of HDL). Additionally, lipid-lowering drugs are usually not used in children as 
they may delay growth.  Supplemental oxygen may be needed when pulmonary complications are 
severe. Use of growth hormone has also been reported. Further, loperamide is used to treat diarrhoea 
and pain medication (avoiding NSAIDs and paracetamol). 
Several attempts have been made to use cell and solid organ transplantation as an indirect source of 
ASM replacement therapy. Transplantation of either amniotic cell sheets or purified amniotic epithelial 
cells has been performed in several patients at  the chronic visceral end of the ASMD spectrum. Most 
patients did not  experience a noticeable change in hepatosplenomegaly. This approach was limited  by 
the short-term viability of amniotic cells, which  necessitates repeat transplantation procedures every 2 
to 4 months  to maintain corrective ASM activity. 
While the experience to date with cell and organ transplantation  has been limited,  observations from 
these cases have shown that  some improvement in somatic features may occur in patients  at the 
chronic visceral end of the ASMD spectrum. However, little  to no improvement has been observed in 
slowing disease progression in patients at  the infantile neurovisceral end. 
Therefore, there remains an unmet  medical need for medicinal products to treat or slow disease 
progression.  
2.2.  About the product 
Xenpozyme (olipudase alfa), developed as an enzyme replacement therapy to  supplement deficient 
ASM in ASMD patients,  converts sphingomyelin into ceramide in ASMD patients. Olipudase alfa (in the 
report abbreviated as olipudase alfa) is a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase expressed in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells. The resulting gene product retains the  enzy matic activity and lysosomal 
targeting of the native protein.  
The indication is: Xenpozyme is indicated  as an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non -
Central Nervous System (CNS) manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD)  in 
paediatric and adult  patients with  type A/B or type B . 
The proposed target dose regimen, with within-patient  dose escalation, is 3.0 mg/kg every two weeks 
(Q2W) administered as a ~3.67  hours (220  minutes) intravenous (IV) infusion.  Full details on the 
within-patients  dose escalation and infusion time are available in the proposed SmPC which is 
separately attached. For a discussion on the indication,  refer to the clinical efficacy discussion.  
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the  applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that   
“Based on the clinical data submitted  within  this request it is anticipated that  olipudase alfa will fulfil 
the existing unmet medical need in the  treatment of disease symptoms of ASMD. Treatment with 
olipudase alfa is likely to have an effect on the visceral symptoms of ASMD. Considering that  the 
protein will not  cross the BBB, no effect on the neur ological symptoms of ASMD,  that mainly occur in 
ASMD type A and ASMD type A/B, is expected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 15/136 
 
 
 
 
Given the rarity of ASMD, the number of patients treated in the clinical program (e.g. 59 patients)  is 
the best at this  moment. It is anticipated that  the benefits of treatment  outweigh the potential safety 
issues and risk  of not  treating these ASMD patients”. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a sterile lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution  for 
infusion containing  20 mg olipudase alfa per vial as the active substance.  
Other ingredients are sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, sodium phosphate dibasic 
heptahydrate, sucrose, and L-methionine.   
The product is available in Type I glass vial with a siliconised chlorobutyl-elastomer lyophilization 
stopper, and an aluminium  seal with  a plastic  flip-off cap. Each pack contains 1, 5,  10 or 25  vials. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General  Information

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture,  process controls and characterisation   
Manufacturer 
Active Substance manufacturing is performed by Patheon Biologics LLC,  Saint Louis, MO, USA.  During 
the procedure a major objection (MO) was raised to request proof of GMP compliance of the  Patheon 
Biologics site. Relevant documentation was provided and the MO was considered resolved.  
Manufacturing  process 
The olipudase alfa active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main  steps 
are expansion of viable cells from WCB, fermentation, harvest, purification,  formulation, filtration  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022

filling. The ranges of critical process parameters and the  routine in-process controls along with 
acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxins, are described for each step. 
The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable.  
One WCB vial is used to  produce one batch  of olipudase alfa active substance. Each harvest is clarified  
and loaded onto the  purification column. The resulting  eluates are pooled prior to the  next purification 
operation, and the  pool is then  processed  to generate the active substance.  
No reprocessing or reworking is performed. 
The overview of the active substance manufacturing process in  S.2.2  is sufficiently detailed. For each 
process step, a narrative description and flow diagram with information on non -critical IPCs and their 
action limits,  critical IPCs and their acceptance criteria, and process parameters and their criticality and 
operational ranges is provided. The operational ranges provided in S.2.2 are sufficiently supported by 
process characterisation studies. 
Control of Materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted.  Compendial raw materials are tested in  accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test  methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. A 
Certificate of Analysis and Certificate of Suitability are provide d and acceptable documents have been 
provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the e stablishment of cell substrate. 
The olipudase alfa transgene used to generate the manufacturing cell line was derived from a cDNA 
obtained from the  IMAGE Consortium.    
Generation and isolation of the product clone expressing olipudase  alfa included transfection with  the 
expression vector, selection, single cell cloning of selected pools, scale -up and productivity and clone 
selection.  
The applicant has provided sufficient information on the  construction of the olipudase alfa expression 
vector, host  cell line, and generation of the  manufacturing cell line. Monoclonality of the cell bank is 
based on one single-cell cloning  step and supported by a probability calc ulation and characterisation of 
end of production cells (EOP), confirming transgene sequence, transgene integrity and comparability 
between MCB, WCB, and EOP (Southern Blot), and gene copy number analysis of MCB,  WCB, and EOP.  
A two-tiered cell bank system was prepared from the seed bank according to cGMP  requirements and 
ICH guidelines. In addition, EOP from the bioreactor were characterised to establish the limit of in vitro 
cell age. The applicant has provided sufficient information on the two -tiered cell banking system. 
Testing of the MCB, WCB and EOP for adventitious agents was performed in line with  ICH Q5A. No 
viruses other than the retrovirus-particles that  are known to be present in  CHO cells were detected. 
Stability of the cell banks will  be monitored by % viability on thaw.  The limit of  in vitro cell age is 
determined and controlled. 
Control of critical step and intermediates 
The applicant has provided a summary of the control strategy, including definitions,  an overview of key 
and critical process parameters, in process intermediate hold times,  in-process controls, and method 
descriptions and validations. Acceptable information has been provided on the  control system in place 
to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process with  regard to critical, as well as 
non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. 
Assessment report

Process validation 
The olipudase alfa active substance manufacturing process has been validated a dequately. Consistency 
in production has been shown on multiple  full scale commercial batches. All acceptance criteria for the 
critical operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in -process tests are fulfilled 
demonstrating that  the purification process consistently produces olipudase alfa active substance of 
reproducible quality that  complies with  the predetermined specification and in -process acceptance 
criteria. 
Process consistency validation has been completed for the olipudase  alfa active substance commercial 
manufacturing process.  
Impurity clearance was evaluated at full  scale. This is acceptable. For most impurities, adequate 
removal is demonstrated and/or ensured by active substance release tests. The applicant is 
recommended to include a control for an impurity in the active substance release specification (REC 
3).  
Transport validation of active substance was performed from the active substance facility to  the facility 
for fill finish processing. Three substance batches were us ed for the transport validation protocol. The 
results demonstrate that  temperature could be controlled within  2-8°C, and that  product quality was 
not impacted. 
Membrane lifetime validation is performed at the manufacturing scale, concurrently with  the process 
validation campaign and then with  commercial production. Chromatography column resin lifetimes 
were established through small scale studies and are  being confirmed at  manufacturing scale as part of 
the validation campaign and concurrent with  commercial manufacturing campaigns.  
The olipudase alfa purification process intermediates were validated for routine hold times (Normal 
Operating Range) and for the maximum allowable hold times (Proven Acceptable Range). The routine 
hold time study was conducted at a commercial scale. The extended hold times for maximum hold 
times (PAR) study was conducted at a small scale using commercial-scale material and tested for 
chemical/ biochemical stability, while the  PAR study for microbial control was conducted at  a 
commercial scale using the bioreactor production  medium. 
Manufacturing  process development 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process was developed in parallel with  the clinical 
development program. Several important changes have been introduced  during the development of 
the manufacturing process.  
For each change in manufacturing process, a comparability study has been carried out  demonstrating 
that,  apart from some expected differences, the change did not have a significant influence on the 
quality of the product. 
Control strategy development 
For all process steps, the applicant performed a risk assessment to select parameters for further 
characterisation in development or small scale studies. Equivalence between the small 
scale/development process steps and the commercial process steps is sufficiently demonstrated. A 
high-level summary of the  results of the characterisation studies is provided, inclu ding for each process 
step, a tabular overview of the proven acceptable ranges for the studied  process parameters. In 
addition, an overview of the final control strategy, including  the conclusion on parameter criticality, 
NORs, and, if applicable, PARs is provided. The approach is acceptable.  
Characterisation 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 18/136 
 
 
 
 
The olipudase alfa active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and 
biological state-of-the-art methods revealing that  the active substance has the expected structure of  a 
recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase.  The analytical results are consistent with  the proposed 
structure.  
The applicant has in  general appropriately characterised the physicochemical properties of olipudase 
alfa, including its primary structure,  seconda ry and higher-order structure, glycosylation and post-
translational modifications. A sufficient number of PPQ batches were included in the characterisation 
study. 
Furthermore, heterogeneity of the active substance was adequately characterised by analysing  the 
presence of impurities  in the active substance. A summary of the levels of product-related impurities 
observed historically and in the clinical batches is prov ided.  
Biological activity was characterised by evaluating enzyme kinetics and relative potency. Potency  is 
determined using  a cell-based assay. The information provided on biological activity and potency 
control is in general sufficient.  
The applicant has provided an overview of the levels of process-related impurities in active substance 
baches and performed a safety assessment for the  process -related impurities. The residual levels of 
impurities are acceptable.  
In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule . 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications 
The active substance specifications for olipudase alfa includes tests for appearance (colour, clarity, 
degree of opalescence), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), pH  (Ph. Eur.), identity (peptide map by UPLC-UV), 
protein concentration (A 280), enzymatic (Specific) Activity (HAD-PC), aggregation (SEC), dimer content 
(SEC), purity (RP-UPLC), free thiol  content (spectrophotometric), oligosaccharide profiling (HPLC -FLD), 
charged isoforms pattern  (cIEF), residual CHO DNA (qPCR), pyrogen test (Ph. Eur.),  bioburden (Ph. 
Eur.).  
Analytical procedures and reference standard 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non -compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in  accordance with ICH guidelines. Appropriate information on reference 
standards was provided. 
The applicant has provided descriptions of all methods, including, if relevant, information on the 
method principle, critical reagents and equipment, sample preparation and dil utions,  reference 
standards and controls, procedural details, system suitability and sample acceptance criteria, and data 
analysis and reportable results. The provided information is sufficiently detailed.  
Method  validation was performed in line with  ICH Q2(R1). Brief summaries are provided. The applicant 
states that  method validation was executed at  the active substance manufacturing site under approved 
validation protocols, the  following cGMP and using  qualified instrumentation.  Compendial methods 
were verified for their intended use. All validation criteria were met.  
Batch analysis 
An overview of the release testing results of the  batches is provided, including information on the date 
of manufacture and purpose. The results support batch-to-batch  consistency, although  some 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 19/136 
 
 
 
 
differences in specific activity are noted when  comparing batches manufactured according to  the 
different active substance manufacturing processes (see the section on comparability). 
Justification  of specification 
The proposed active substance release test panel is agreed, with  a recommendation to include a test 
for an impurity (REC 3).  
Part of the  tests is performed on unformulated bulk. This can be accepted.   
The pyrogen test replaced the bacterial endotoxin test  due to low endotoxin  recovery. This can be 
accepted.  
The correlation between relative potency and specific activity is limited. However, as  the  active 
substance release test panel also includes controls for other quality attributes it  can be accepted that 
the cell-based potency test is only performed at the finished product stage. The applicant is 
recommended to further identifying the root cause of the difference between the results in the specific 
activity assay and the relative potency assay (REC 1).   
Container closure 
The applicant has provided a brief description of the container closure system, including drawings and 
CoAs and acceptable specifications were provided.  
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The stability results indicate that  the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the  proposed 
shelf life in  the proposed container. 
The applicant performed long-term (refrigerated, 5 ±  3°C), accelerated (25 ± 5°C/60±5%RH),  and 
forced degradation studies (30°C at pH 5.0,  35°C at pH  8.0, photostab ility,  agitation, oxidation). Based 
on the forced degradation studies, the applicant identified  degradation pathways. In addition,  an 
impact of the stress conditions   is observed. The applicant states that  potency decreased under all 
conditions.  
Five batches  were included in the long term and accelerated stability study. Data are available for 12 
(accelerated) and 24 (long-term) weeks. The stability test  panel includes appearance, activity, SE -
HPLC (aggregates and dimer), concentration, deamidation, pH, purity by CE-SDS (reduced), purity  by 
RP-HPLC, specific activity,  bacterial endotoxin, and bioburden. A control for free thiols  will be included 
in the test  panel for future stability studies. The absence of the cell-based potency test in the  stability 
test panel is acceptable for routine stability testing.  The applicant is recommended to include the cell-
based potency assay in the stability test  panel for stability studies that  are performed to demonstrate 
comparability in case of process changes, unless this  is covered by finished  product stability data.  
The stability data all complied with  the acceptance criteria, but some trends have been identified by 
the applicant. The changes are generally modest, and results support the proposed shelf life of 24 
weeks at 2-8°C. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2 . 4 . 3 . 1 .     Description of the  product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The olipudase alfa finished product (Xenpozyme) is a sterile lyophilised powder for solution for 
intravenous infusion.  It is supplied in an aseptically filled single-use vial with  a nominal strength  of 20 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 20/136 
 
 
 
 
mg/vial. Prior to lyophilization, the  nominal fill  volume is 5.0 mL. The finished product is reconstituted 
with  nominal 5.1 mL sterile water for injection (WFI)  prior to use. The composition of the olipudase alfa 
finished product is identical to the olipudase alfa active substance.  
The finished product is filled in  a 20  mL Ph. Eur. Type 1 colourless clear glass vial closed with 20  mm 
siliconised gray chlorobutyl elastomeric stopper. The stoppered vials are crimped with  an aluminium 
seal with  a Flip-Off button.  The primary packaging material complies with  Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
No overage is used.  
The excipients in olipudase alfa active substance and finished product are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and are widely used in commercial biopharmaceutical formulations for intravenous 
administration. Their quality is compliant with  Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in 
the finished product formulation. No excipients of human or animal or igin are used. 
The provided data including comparative data of the biological activity on finished product batches 
manufactured from the different active substance processes and optimised finished product processes 
do not appear to show any relevant differences. 
Finished product development studies included optimisation of the lyophilization cycle . Real-time 
stability has been performed to confirm the suitability  of the  lyophilisation cycle for implementation.  
Extractable and leachable (E&L)  assessments of the primary packaging components and the key 
product-contact materials associated with  the filling lines  were performed. The levels of any potential 
leachable or extractable compound were considerably lower than  the Analytical Evaluation Threshold 
and do not pose a toxicological safety concern for olipudase alfa finished product. No  elemental 
impurity above the ICH Q3D limits for parenteral compounds was detected in the course of the 
leachable study. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture  of the  product and process controls  
The manufacture of olipudase alfa finished product is a standard process in which  active substance, 
without  further formulation, is lyophilised. It consists of 7 process steps : 1) active substance receipt 
and storage 2) Transfer and hook-up 3) Sterile filtration  and filling 4) Lyophilization  5) Capping and 
inspection 6) Labelling and Packaging 7) finished product storage and shipping.  
The process has been described in sufficient de tail. Critical steps  have been identified. Reprocessing is 
not allowed in finished product manufacturing. Setpoints and PAR (proven acceptable ranges) have 
been provided for the CPP. Sufficient details have been provided for the CPP of each step. Hold tim es 
and time out of refrigeration have been validated. 
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that  the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the  finished product of intended quality  in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate. The manufacture of the PPQ lots included all steps of the 
manufacturing process. All four PPQ lots were lyophilised successfully and confirmed the Process 
parameter ranges as set in the control strategy; CPPs were verified for  each PPQ lot.  A simulated 
shipping validation study has been performed to support stability  during transport.

2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product specifications for Xenpozyme , include tests for appearance powder (visual), 
appearance reconstituted (visual, colour, clarity/degree of opalescence) (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. 
Eur.), particulates (Ph. Eur.), pH  (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution  time (visual), residual moisture (Ph. Eur.), 
identity (dot  blot), protein concentration (A280),  enzymatic (specific) ac tivity (HAD-PC), relative 
potency (cellular uptake), impurities (aggregation, dimer content  (SEC)), purity (RP -UPLC), free thiol 
content (spectrophotometric), pyrogen test  (Ph. Eur.), sterility (USP), container closure integrity 
(headspace analysis). 
The proposed set of critical quality attributes  selected as release criteria covers all relevant aspects of 
the finished product. The relative potency test will be added to the shelf life specification for the post-
approval stability studies. The applicant is recommended to provide data for three post-approval 
stability batches including  the potency results (REC 4).  
During the procedure, a MO was raised on the control of potency at both  active substance and finished 
product level and further details were requested to  ensure there is adequate control. In response the 
applicant has provided additional data and discussion and has sufficiently justified that  the release 
testing  strategy for potency, including  the relative potency test, specific activity test, and th e free 
thiols is appropriate to  control the relevant biological activities including  uptake.  In combination  with 
the relative potency assay the biological activity is sufficiently controlled and the MO was considered 
resolved.  However, the Applicant is recommended to further investigate the apparent discrepancy 
between the specific activity assay and the relative potency assay (REC 1).   
The assays for identity testing,  residual moisture, Protein content (A280),  Purity (RP -UPLC), Container 
Closure Integrity test  (headspace test) and reconstitution time are sufficiently validated/verified. The 
same reference standard is used as in  the active substance testing.  The endotoxin test (LAL)  showed a 
low endotoxin recovery, and as a replacement, a rabbit Pyrogen test is being implemented. The 
pyrogen assay was sufficiently qualified. The applicant is committed to  developing a non-animal test 
that  will replace the rabbit assay (REC 6). 
The proposed acceptance criteria for aggregation, concentration and free thiol  content can be 
accepted. As the release specification for reconstitution time  is considered rather wide, the applicant is 
recommended to review it after an additional 30 batches have been manufactured (REC 5).  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the  finished product has been assessed on a risk -
based approach in  line with the  ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities .  
During the procedure, a MO was raised as only a QP statement,  on the risk of presence of nitrosamines 
was provided. In response, risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in  the 
finished product has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in 
line with  the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on  the CHMP 
Opinion for the Article 5(3)  of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  referral on nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020)  and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 
5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004-  Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020).  Based on the information provided it  is accepted that  no risk was identified on 
the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. 
Therefore, no additional  control measures are deemed necessary.  
Batch  analysis  
Batch release data have been provided for all batches manufactured (preclinical, clinical and PPQ). The 
different (developmental and characterisation) biological activity assays have not been performed on 
all batches. For the cellular uptake potency test results for the  PPQ batches have been provided as well

as justified bridging data for cellular uptake assay of the clinical batches finished product. This is 
sufficient to support the  potency testing  strategy.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the finished product shelf life of 48  months and storage conditions at 
2-8°C, as stated in the  SmPC are acceptable. 
The requested shelf life is generally supported by 60 months primary stability results of an Engineering 
lot of the commercial process with  the optimised lyophilisation process  stored at 2-8°C  and 6 months 
accelerated stability data stored at  25±2°C. In addition, the supporting stability include s up to 60 
months of long-term stability data from two finished product lots manufactured using the original 
lyophilization cycle stored at  2-8°C. All Quality Attributes tested were within  specification, and no trends 
were observed. However, the stability test panel did not include an appropriate potency test. The 
applicant has agreed to add the relative potency test to the post-approval stability protocol and 
committed to provide data for three of these batches (REC 4). The currently provided data showing no 
trend in the biological activity and gives sufficient reassurance concerning the stability during shelf life. 
The stability studies of the PPQ batches are ongoing, and the company is committed to completing the 
stability studies. 
Photostability testing  was performed on finished product packaged in immediate (primary) and 
marketing (secondary) packs. Samples were exposed to light (as per ICH Q1B option 2) for 5 days. All 
test results for samples exposed to light are comparable to dark control samples.  
In-use stability 
(SmPC): “After reconstitution, chemical, physical and microbiological in-use stability has been 
demonstrated for up to 24 hours at 2-8°C or 12 hours at room temperature (up to 25°C). After dilution, 
chemical, physical and microbiological in-use stability has been demonstrated between 0.1 mg/mL and 
3.5 mg/mL for 24 hours at 2-8°C, and up to 12 hours (including infusion time) when stored at room 
temperature (up to 25°C).” The provided in use stability data show no OOS results or trends and 
support the stability at these conditions.

2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Cell bank testing  is performed in accordance with ICH guidance, and the  unprocessed bulk harvest is 
tested for adventitious viral agents and minute mouse virus. The only material of animal or human 
origin used in the production of olipudase alfa is gamma irradiated bovine serum. A Certificate of 
Analysis and Certificate of Suitability  are provided.  
Virus validation studies are in line with expectations . The suitability of the scaled-down models has 
been sufficiently demonstrated. Both new and aged resins were used in the studies and yielded 
comparable results. The model viruses used in the studies include  Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus 
(XMuLV),  Murine Minute  Virus (MMV),  Feline Calicivirus (FCV),  and Pseudorabies Virus (PRV). This is 
acceptable.

2.4.4.  Discussion on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out ind icate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn  lead to the  conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
During the procedure MOs were raised on the  GMP sta tus of the active substance manufacturer, on the 
control of potency at both  active substance and finished product level, and on the missing nitrosamines 
risk assessment. All MOs were sufficiently answered and resolved by the applicant by the provision of 
additional documentation and data. 
At the time of the CHMP  opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which  pertain to  commitments made by the applicant 
to complete various characterisation, development and stability studies. These points listed as 
recommendations for future  quality development.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be accepta ble when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs  to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP  recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant should perform additional work to  understand the  root cause of the  difference 
between the specific activity and potency assays by further evaluating the role of (and potential 
interaction between) the key attributes  associated with  activity and potency . This work may 
include characterizing olipudase alfa samples.  
2.  The applicant should submit the final report concerning the  mixing studies as soon as the 
validation activities are completed in  a Post-Authorisation Measure.  
3.  The applicant should implement the ELISA-based determination of cathepsin D to the  active 
substance release test panel upon successful method transfer, completed validation work and 
establishment of acceptance criterion with  20  active substance lots and submit as an 
appropriate post-approval variation.  
4.  The first three stability studies in which relativ e potency is included in the specification will be  
the 2021,  2022 and 2023  annual finished product stability lots. The applicant should submit two 
(2) Post-Authorization  Measures with  stability data for these three lots when 24 months  and  60 
months of long-term stability data is available from the  2023 annual finished product stability 
lot, and to report any confirmed out of specification results or significant adverse trends 
observed during the stability studies. 
Assessment report

5.  The applicant should review the Reconstitution  Time for dosing with  a view to tightening  the  
acceptance criteria upon completion of the manufacture of 30  finished product batches. 
6.  The applicant should submit a Type II variation to replace the pyrogen with  a validated non -
animal test.  
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Olipudase alfa is a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase produced in Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells. Xenpozyme (olipudase alfa) is indicated as a n enzyme replacement therapy for long-term 
treatment of non-Central Nervous System (CNS)  manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency 
(ASMD) in paediatric and adult  patients with  type A/B or type B. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Animal model used in pharmacology 
The applicant made use of a disease model for NPD, ASMKO mice. In this  mice model, the ASM 
enzyme is removed. In the  publication from Horinouchi  et al., the model is described. The enzyme was 
shown not to  be active in brains, heart, liver, spleen, kidney and lung.  The characteristic foam cells 
were mainly observed in bone marrow and spleen. In a moribund state,  the animals had lower weight, 
and the main organs were smaller. The hepatosplenomegaly, characteristic of the  disease in human, 
was thus not  observed. In the brains, loss of Purkinje cells and atrophy of  the cerebellum and midbrain 
was observed as well. In the animals, an increase in plasma cholesterol was also observed, but  this 
was not used as a marker of disease in the  studies presented in this  dossier. The absence of ASM 
activity is also present in human. However, the observation that  organs get smaller due to the disease 
and the absence of hepatosplenomegaly is not  common to human disease.  
Primary Pharmacology 
In vitro  
The enzyme appears to be optimally effective at acidic pH between 5.2  and 5.5.  While pH in  early 
endosome is ~6.5,  late endosome ~5.5  and lysosome ~4.5, it  could be suggested that  this enzyme is 
most active in  the late endosome. Bach et al., 1999*  seem to suggest that  the pH  in lysosomes of cells 
from Nieman Pick Syndrome Type C or Type A is in the range of 4.3-4.5.  As the in vivo data clearly 
show activity of the enzyme, olipudase alfa might rather become activated in the late endosome. 
Indeed, in their  recently appeared review†, Breiden and Sandhoff refer to ASM as an endo/lysosomal 
enzyme. This would explain the in vivo observed effects considering the in vitro data on activity.

Sphingomyelin depletion due to Olipudase Alfa administration  
ASMKO mice were IV administered a single dose of 1, 3 or 5 mg/kg olipudase alfa to  evaluate its effect 
on sphingomyelin (SPM)  depletion in liver, spleen, lung and kidney. In study 02 -0428Pnp,  a single 
dose of 1 mg/kg olipudase alfa reduced sphingomyelin levels in all tissues. In the  liver 62 -75%  SPM 
reduction starting at  Day 3 and continuing  to Week 2 was observed. In the spleen and lung,  46 -48% 
SPM reduction at day 7 and in the  kidney 23% SPM reduction at day 3 was observed. All tissues 
showed sphingomyelin re-accumulation back to pre-dose level at  week 4. In study 05-1223Pnp, 
following a single 3 mg/kg intravenous administration of olipudase alfa in ASMKO mice, maximal 
depletion of SPM was observed in the liver at approximately 5 days post-dose, while  for the spleen, 
this occurs at approximately 7 days post-dose. Re-accumulation of SPM starts between 7 and 14 days 
post-dose. Three weeks post-dose, sphingomyelin levels were still depleted with  48% in the liver and 
with  30% in the  spleen. In study 01-0110Pnp,  upon administration of a single IV dose of 5 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa to ASMKO mice, SPM reduction from Day 1 to Day 7 post-dose was observed in all 
tissues. In liver 74-95%,  in spleen 65-80%, in  kidney 70% and in lung 26-43%  SPM reduction 
(compared to untreated animals) was observed. All tissues  showed starting of sphingomyelin re-
accumulation between 7 and 21 days post-dose. Predose plasma sphingomyelin levels were just above 
the level of detection. Plasma sphingomyelin levels remained unchanged throughout  the duration of 
the study. From this  study it is suggested that  the dose level of 5 mg/kg is most effective. 
The Cmax in humans cannot be compared to that in the non-clinical species since the infusion rate is much 
longer  in  humans  (220  minutes)  compared  to  the  non-clinical  species  (<30  minutes).  The  exposure 
(AUC) in the non-clinical species at  a dose of 3 mg/kg is lower than in humans.  
Comparison of different lots 
Three different lots of olipudase alfa after a single dose of 3 mg/kg were compared in a time -
dependent manner. No significant  differences in sphingomyelin reduction in the  liver, spleen and lung 
were observed between the three lots. Hereby, the efficacy of all three lots is shown, and their use in 
toxicology studies is supported. Likewise, the influence of the two  manufacturing proc esses of 0, 1, 
and 3 mg/kg olipudase alfa on reducing sphingomyelin in the liver, kidney, and spleen was evaluated. 
Again, no statistical differences in sphingomyelin reduction or ceramide production were observed.  
Effect of different levels  of HMWS 
High  Molecular Weight  Species (HMWS)  have been observed during the production of olipudase alfa. To 
evaluate the effect these HMWS may have on the efficacy of olipudase alfa, ASMKO mice were 
administered a single dose of 1.0 mg/kg ([Study 02-0790Pnp])  or 5.0 mg/kg ([Study 02-0495Pnp]) 
olipudase alfa or HMWS-olipudase alfa and tissues were collected 24 or 72 hours post-dose for 
biochemical sphingomyelin analysis. Upon a dose of 1.0 mg/kg, the presence of HMWS  seemingly 
reduced the efficacy of olipudase alfa in the liver (24  and 72 hr) and the kidney (24  hr only), but  not in 
the lung and spleen. However, in a subsequent study [Study 13-04646]  with  three lots of olipudase 
alfa (3.0 mg/kg) containing low (target 15%),  medium (target 30 %) or high (target 65 %) a mounts 
of HMWS,  no statistically  significant differences in sphingomyelin content were noted between 
olipudase alfa and all HMWS-olipudase alfa treatment  groups in liver, spleen, and kidney. Based on 
these data, it does not appear that  HMWS olipudase alfa (low,  mid, or high)  impacts efficacy or safety 
in the ASMKO mouse compared to olipudase alfa under the conditions of this  study.  
Effect of variations in the  dose regimen 
Two studies were performed to evaluate the  pharmacodynamics of olipudase alfa followin g a repeat 
dosing regimen of every other week for 12 weeks in  ASMKO mice. In study 02 -1084Pnp  (0,  0.1, 0.3,  or 
1 mg/kg olipudase alfa QOW (every other week), the  biochemical analysis showed a dose-responsive 
reduction of sphingomyelin in the  liver, spleen, and kidney at 1 and 2 weeks post-dose followed by re-

accumulation of SPM at Week 2 post-dose. Histo-morphometric analysis showed a dose-responsive 
reduction of sphingomyelin in the  liver and spleen, with  the kidney following  a similar trend. There was 
no evidence of sphingomyelin reduction in the lung  by biochemical or histo-morphometric analysis 
across doses. In study 04-0813  (0, 0.3,  1.0, 3.0  mg/kg olipudase alfa QOW), the biochemical analysis 
showed a dose-responsive reduction of sphingomyelin in the lung and spleen. Sphingomyelin reduction 
in the lung  of the  1 and 3 mg/kg groups were 61%  and 58%,  respectively. Sphingomyelin levels were 
reduced to near background levels in the liver in all dose groups (0.3,  1.0,  and 3.0  mg/kg) and had re-
accumulated to pre-dose levels at 28 days post  final dose.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Two-phase degradation 
A single administration  of olipudase alfa at  20 mg/kg results in a rapid increase in ceramide, 
sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate in the serum of ASMKO mice. There appear to  be two 
distinct  phases to the  generation of ceramide characterized by an early, rapid rise (2 -45  min) followed 
by a second rise at 240  and 540  minutes postdose. SPH and S1P were signific antly elevated at  240 
minutes postdose and SPH remained elevated at 540 minutes postdose. Sphingosine -1-phosphate 
levels returned to baseline at 540  minutes postdose. The two  phases of degradation products may 
indicate separate SPM breakdown events due to different sources of SPM. The applicant provided a 
discussion on the activity of the  enzyme at different pH  and locations of SPM and of the enzyme. The 
initial  production of ceramide in ASMKO mice (5-45  min. postdose) is the result of olipudase alfa 
mediated hydrolysis of sphingomyelin that  is not  present in  lysosomes but rather in an “easy to 
access” pool. It is unknown where this  pool may reside but  may include sphingomyelin found in  the 
outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or in  blood lipid particles. The early high peak of ceramide, 
following SPM degradation by olipudase alfa in ASM KO mice, was apparently not  observed in ASM 
patients. This is reassuring for the safety. The second and later peak of ceramide is likely reflecting 
SPM degradation in  the endolysosomal compartment.

Degradation  products and pro-inflammatory cytokines 
Five studies were performed to investigate the toxic effects of a single high dose of olipudase alfa in 
ASMKO mice and in C57BL/6 mice dosed up to  20 mg/kg. In study 05-1008Pnp  (20  mg/kg), significant 
elevations of ceramide were noted from 2 minutes through 45  minutes postdose, but  no elevation of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines was noted within  45 minutes  postdose. In study 05 -0127Pnp  (20 mg/kg) 
and 05-0374Pnp  (0.3, 3.0,  and 10 mg/kg), large dose-responsive increases in interleukin- (IL) 6 and 
G-CSF were observed at 3 and 4 hours postdose and continuing  up to 9 hours postdose at doses of 3, 
10, and 20 mg/kg. Smaller increases were seen in IL-1α, IL-1β, and MIP-1α 3,  4, and 6 hours postdose 
at these doses. No notable increase in TNF-α  was observed at any time point  for any dose. In this 
second phase also, the  elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is noted. No cytokine response was 
seen in  C57BL/6 (wild type) mice [Study 05-0436Pnp]  following a single dose of 20  mg/kg olipudase 
alfa. Results suggest that  elevations in cytokines seen in ASMKO mice at this  dose (previous studies) 
are related to the breakdown of substrate present in  ASMKO mice. 
Dose escalation strategy  to minimize the toxic  effect of degradation  products 
To mitigate the toxic response of olipudase alfa in ASMKO mice, a dose -escalation strategy was 
evaluated as part of the  nonclinical program. Cytokine levels were assayed following a variety of dose 
escalation regimens in four studies in  ASMKO mice [Studies 05-1009Pnp,  05-1010Pnp,  05-1240Pnp 
and 05-0437Pnp],  each employing a different dosing regimen. Serum was collected four and eight  or 
nine hours post last dose in all studies for the measurement of cytokine levels using the  Bio-Plex 
Mouse Cytokine 18-Plex Panel assay. In study 05-1009Pnp,  it was shown that  administration of 3 
mg/kg olipudase alfa (D1) and 20  mg/kg (D3) to  ASMKO mice significantly altered circulating levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to samples from untreated mice from Genzyme Study 05-
0374Pnp.  Compared to samples from ASMKO mice receiving a single dose of 20 mg/kg in Study 05 -
0127,  elevations were considerably lower. These data support a controlled debulking strategy to 
minimize the cytokine response. In study 05-1010Pnp  3 mg/kg olipudase alfa on (D1) and on (D6) to 
ASMKO mice resulted in an increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels following the first 3  mg/kg 
dose only. In contrast, the second dose (D6) did not result in cytokine release of the s ame magnitude, 
supporting a controlled debulking strategy as a means to reduce or eliminate the  cytokine release. In 
study 05-1240Pnp,  administration of olipudase alfa doses of 3 mg/kg on (D1) and 20  mg/kg on (D6) 
resulted in a reduction of circulating levels of selected cytokines at 4 and 9 hours post olipudase alfa 
administration relative to  a single 20 mg/kg olipudase alfa. In study [05-0437Pnp]  an initial  3 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa dose prevented increases in proinflammatory cytokines following  subsequent d oses of 3 
mg/kg and followed by a final 20  mg/kg dose and ASMKO mice surviving toxic dose (20  mg/kg) of 
olipudase alfa. These data support the implementation  of a dose -escalation regimen in  the treatment 
of patients with  olipudase alfa.  
Relationship degradation products and toxicity of olipudase alfa  in ASMKO mice 
The relationship between ceramide levels (blood ceramide and ceramide isoforms measured by 
LC/MS/MS)  and the toxicity observed in ASMKO mice was investigated.  In study 06-0778,  transient 
increases in total and C16 circulating ceramide in C57BL/6  and ASMKO+/- HET mice without 
statistically significant  differences in CRP levels between ASMKO and C57BL/6  mice receiving 20 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa. In study 07-1346,  increased levels of plasma ceramide (total) and C16-ceramide were 
observed that correlated with  increased lethality and poor clinical outcome in ASMKO, mostly at  the 10 
mg/kg olipudasre alfa. Male mice treated with  10 or 20  mg/kg olipudase alfa had statistically 
significant increases in total  ceramide and C16-ceramide compared to  female mice treated with 
corresponding doses. The reason for this apparent difference in ceramide levels between genders is 
unknown. However, no apparent difference in safety findings  was noted in  the toxicity studies b etween 
male and female ASMKO mice. In study 07-1511,  a single dose of 10 mg/kg olipudase alfa in C57BL/6 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 28/136 
 
 
 
 
mice resulted in a significant increase of total circulating  ceramide (C16, C22 and C24) concentrations 
at 60 minutes  postdose and C16 isoform was transiently increased up to 120  minutes postdose, 
compared to untreated animals. However, by 540 minutes postdose, circulating levels were returning 
to untreated concentrations. No toxicity was observed at the time points evaluated (consistent with 
previous studies). In study 07-1578  ASMKO mice following a debulking regimen (3 mg/kg QOD) all 
survived the final 20 mg/kg olipudase alfa dose. The debulking regimen eliminated the toxic response 
to olipudase alfa, and elevations of ceramide, SPH, and S1P seen with high  doses of olipudase alfa. 
Plasma ceramide, SPH, and S1P levels were significantly lower than those seen in historical controls up 
to 540  minutes. In summary, the increased levels of ceramide (C16) observed after single dose of 20 
mg/kg olipudase alfa to ASMKO mice that  are correlated with increased lethality  and poor clinical 
outcome are not observed in C57BL/6 mice and can be eliminated by applying a debulking regimen.  
2.5.2.3.  Safety  pharmacology programme 
Heart  effects upon olipudase alfa treatments  in ASMKO m ice 
In study 05-0533Pnp,  telemetry in conscious ASMKO mice was used to evaluate the effect of olipudase 
alfa on heart function.  Single IV doses of 20 mg/kg olipudase alfa resulted in  decreased heart rate, 
blood pressure, and activity leading to death or the need for moribund euthanasia in all animals within 
43 hours at 20 mg/kg and in 3 of 4 animals within  75 hours of dosing at 10  mg/kg. The 3 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa dose elicited mild decreases in heart rate and activity; however, both  single and 
repeated dosing with  3 mg/kg was well tolerated. In study 06-0302Pnp  ECGenie for conscious, non-
invasive measurement of cardiac function was used to evaluate the effects of olipudase alfa. Baseline 
data gathered from these twenty ASMKO mice indicated a normal resting heart rate of 755 +/- 41 
beats per minute  on average without  arrhythmias. Administration  of 20  mg/kg in olipudase alfa to 
ASMKO mice caused significant  bradycardia (p<0.01). This was composed of an initial  drop in heart 
rate approximately 50 min post-dose, followed by a compensation and continued with  a further drop in 
heart rate around 3 hours post-dose. The bradycardia was accompanied by a statistical significant  QT 
prolongation. This was composed of an initial  increase in the QT in terval 80  min post-dose, followed by 
a period where the QT appeared to decline to a normal interval, and then a steady increase beginning 
4 hours post-dose. The applicant provided additional QTc data. Also QTc was significantly increased 
5,6,7,  and 8 hours after administration of 20 mg/kg olipudase alfa. This is possibly linked to the toxic 
effects of a single high dose of olipudase alfa. Patients will  not receive such a high dose. In addition, no 
QTc prolongation has been observed in the  clinical study.  In study 06-0292Pnp,  electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) collected from C57BL/6 mice indicated no significant drop in  heart rate throughout  the 6 hours 
of monitored electrocardiograms, suggesting 20 mg/kg dose of rhASM is non -toxic to  C57BL/6 mice. It 
is presumed that  because the C57BL/6 strain has acid sphingomyelinase enzyme activity, there is a 
little  build-up of sphingomyelin substrate which further supports that ASMKO toxicity is substrate -
dependent. However, as a dose of 20 mg/kg is lethal  to the ASMKO mice, the  relevance of the  studies 
using ECGenie is questioned. A dose of 3 mg/kg only elicited  a mild decrease in heart rate and activity. 
The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown as an increase in heart rate was observed upon 
administration of olipudase alfa to patients.   
Pivotal single dose study in Cynomolgus monkey 
In study 08002  the effects of IV doses of olipudase alfa on hemodynamic and respiratory parameters 
and electrocardiographic activity were examined in  conscious, telemetered cynomolgus mon keys. The 
IV administration  of olipudase alfa at 30  mg/kg was well tolerated in all study animals. No dose -
related, biologically significant, or adverse effects were observed on blood pressure, heart rate, body 
temperature, ECG intervals, respiratory rate, tidal volume, or blood gas parameters. NOAEL was 
considered to be 30 mg/kg olipudase alfa.

Single dose study in Beagle  dogs 
The potential toxicity of olipudase alfa upon single IV administration of 0, 3, 10,  and 30 mg/kg to 
Beagle dogs followed by a 2-week recovery period [Study 02026].  In addition, samples were collected 
for toxicokinetic evaluation. No significant pathological findings were noted. Hypersensitivity reactions 
were observed in control animals, which were treated with  diphenhydramine  and all remaining test 
article animals. All animals recovered over the 2-week recovery period. After Day 1,  no effects were 
observed on blood pressure, rectal body temperature, or respiration rate . NOAEL  was >30  mg/kg. 
It should be noted that  this study was conducted on healthy animals, and therefore any effect of high 
levels of sphingomyelin degradation products on hemodynamic and respiratory parameters is 
uncertain. However, the  absence of such effects in toxicology studies  precludes the need for further 
studies. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions  of olipudase alfa with  two potential  functional 
inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA s), citalopram and fluoxetine, were evaluated in ASMKO 
mice. FIASMAs are a large group of cationic amphiphilic molecules that  may disrupt the  interaction of 
ASM with  the lysosomal membrane. These drugs could have a negative effect on the  activity of 
olipudase alfa. ASMKO mice were administered 1 mg/kg (olipudase alfa with or without  192  µg/day 
(citalopram) or 300  µg/day (fluoxetine). The latter two  were also administered alone. Sphingomyelin 
was significantly reduced in the liver and spleen 3 days post-administration  of 1 mg/kg olipudase alfa 
to ASM. Co-administration of fluoxetine did not alter olipudase alfa -mediated sphingomyelin reduction 
in liver or spleen. Co-administration of citalopram did not alter olipudase alfa -mediated sphingomyelin 
reduction in the liver, but an effect on the  spleen could not be excluded.  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Olipudase alfa is a recombinant form of the  human enzyme acid sphingomyelinase and is administered 
in humans every 2 weeks as IV infusion over a dose range of 0.03 mg/kg to  3 mg/kg over a period of 
18 minutes to  220 minutes, respectively. The non-clinical kinetics of olipudase alfa were investigated in 
non-clinical species following single or repeated intravenous (IV) administration over a dose range of 
0.3 mg/kg up to 30  mg/kg. Since it is a human enzyme, it is agreed that  the kinetics of olipudase alfa 
have only been investigated in a limited number of non-clinical kinetic studies. No plasma protein 
binding, blood-to-plasma ratio, metabolism or excretion studies are warrante d. IV infusion over a 
prolonged period is not feasible in non-clinical species except for Cynomolgus monkey. Therefore, 
olipudase alfa is administered as bolus dose or an infusion  in 10 minutes in mice, rat, rabbit and dog 
and a 30 minute infusion in monkey. This approach is acceptable. 
The non-clinical kinetics of olipudase alfa were investigated in  the non-clinical species CD-1, C57BL/6 
and acid sphingomyelinase knock out (ASMKO) mice, Sprague -Dawley rats, New  Zealand White 
rabbits, Beagle dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys. The acid sphingomyelinase knock out (ASMKO) mouse 
model is a biochemical model of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) in humans that  has an 
intermediate phenotype of neuropathic and non-neuropathic manifestation of disease, most similar to 
ASMD type A/B phenotype in human disease, and is used to study ASMD and evaluate potential 
therapies. Therefore, this non-clinical species is the most representative of the human patient 
population.

Analytical methods 
An ELISA method was developed for the analysis of olipudase alfa in serum and tissue samples. The 
ELISA method appears sufficiently validated.  Long-term stability data were provided for mouse (12 
months), rabbit  (292 days) and monkey (426  days). No long-term-stability  data are available for rat 
and dog. The maximum sample storage was <9  months for rat and dog. The long -term stability should 
have also been investigated in serum from rat and dog, but will  not be further pursued since the long -
term storage was shown to be >9 months  in mouse, rabbit, monkey and human serum. Incurred 
Sample Reanalysis was not required at the time  the studies were conducted. However, ISR was 
performed in support of GLP study TER0698  (rabbit embryo -foetal toxicity) and met predefined 
acceptance criteria with an overall pass rate of 95.00%.  As bioanalytical method used in GLP study 
TER0694 (CD-1 mouse embryo-foetal toxicity, for which ISR was not  performed) was consisted in its 
design and used same reagents and concentration profiles were similar as in study  T ER0698 no impact 
to accuracy and precision of analysis in mouse samples is suggested.  
Radioactivity in  serum and tissue was analysed using the Cobra Gamma Counter.  
Analytical methods were developed to measure anti-drug antibodies in serum from mouse, rabbit and 
monkey. No methods were developed for rat and dog. The provided analytical methods for the anti -
drug antibodies in serum from mouse, rabbit and monkey appear sufficiently validated, but  were not 
fully validated (no accuracy was determined). The precision and minimal dilution  were sufficiently 
characterised. Only limited  long-term stability data were provided for the analysis method used to 
determine the  amount of anti-drug antibodies. However, based on literature it  is known that anti-drug 
antibodies are stable for >3.5  years under frozen storage conditions (Michaut  et al., 2014;  Hendriks et 
al., 2014;  Ferraz et al., 2008;  Rowe et al., 1970).  Therefore, studies investigating the long-term 
stability of anti-drug  antibodies are not needed. No anti-drug  antibodies were determined in  dog, since 
dogs were only treated with  a single dose. This is agreed. The Applicant provided information on the 
analytical method used to determine anti-drug antibodies in mouse and rabbit serum (studies 
DOS1706 and DOS1691, respectively), but  did not provide the underlying report. Since the precision 
and minimal dilution  are comparable to the precision and minimal dilution  in mouse serum (study 
08GST035) and monkey serum, this  is agreed. 
ADME 
In CD-1 mice following once-daily dosing for 7 days, the AUC ranged from 83.1  µg × h/mL at a dose of 
3 mg and 916 µg ×  h/mL at a dose of 30 mg/kg. In C57BL/6 mice following a single dose of 3  mg/kg, 
the AUCinf ranged from 95.3  to 208 µg  × h/mL. In ASMKO mice following a single dose of 1 to  5 
mg/kg, the AUCinf ranged from 27.4 to  603 µg × h/mL.  In Sprague Dawley rats following a single or 
repeated once every two weeks dose of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, the AUC was ~142  µg × h/mL,  ~500 µg  × 
h/mL and 1340  µg × h/mL,  respectively. The accumulation follo wing repeated dosing ranged from 1.1-
fold to 2.5-fold. In New  Zealand White rabbits following once -daily dosing for 7 days, the AUC ranged 
from 598  µg × h/mL  at a dose of 3 mg and 6350  µg × h/mL  at a dose of 30 mg/kg. In Beagle dogs 
following a single dose of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, the AUCinf ranged from 229 to  2496 µg ×  h/mL. In 
Cynomolgus monkeys following a single or repeated once every two weeks dose of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, 
the AUC ranged from 202 µg ×  h/mL at a dose of 3 mg and 3500 µg ×  h/mL at a dose of 30  mg/kg. A 
decrease in exposure was observed following repeated dosing (0.48 -fold to 0.82-fold),  most likely due 
to the formation of anti-drug antibodies. In humans following repeated dosing once every 2 weeks, the 
AUC is 607 ± 120  μg × h/mL in adults,  529 ± 35  μg × h/mL in  patients 12-17  years, 450 ± 68 μg × 
h/mL, and 403  ± 43 μg × h/mL  in patients <6  years. No accumulation was observed in humans. The 
exposure (AUC) in the non-clinical species at a dose of 3 mg/kg is lower than  that in  humans; doses of 
30 mg/kg resulted in exposures higher than that  observed in humans.

In vivo kinetic studies indicated a volume of distribution ~75  mL/kg in C57BL/6 mice, 160 mL/kg in 
ASMKO mice, 45 mL/kg in Sprague Dawley rats, ~110  mL/kg in Beagle dog and 230 mL/kg in 
Cynomolgus monkey. The volume of distribution  increased with increasing dose and was highest in 
ASMKO mice (~150  mL/kg at a dose of 1 mg/kg and ~270  mL/kg at a dose of 5 mg/kg). Distribution 
studies conducted in C57BL/6 and ASMKO mice indicated that  the majority  of olipudase alfa was found 
in the liver (approximately 40% of the dose) with  lower levels in the kidney, spleen, and lung (less 
than 1%  of the  dose for each tissue). There was no detectable olipudase alfa in brain tissue.  No 
placental transfer studies or excretion studies into milk have been conducted. 
The elimination half-life is ~2.3 h in C57BL/6  mice, ~4.2  h in ASMKO mice, ~1.5  h in Sprague Dawley 
rats, ~7 h om Beagle dogs and ~7.5  h in Cynomolgus monkey. The elimination half -life ranged from 
32 to 38  hours in  adult humans which is much longer than that  observed in the  non -clinical species. 
This is most likely because olipudase alfa is a human enzyme. Clearance was ~25  mL/h/kg in C57BL/6 
mice, ~30 mL/h/kg in ASMKO mice, ~22 mL/h/kg in Sprague Dawley rats, ~13  mL/h/kg in Beagle 
dogs and ~29 mL/h/kg in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Anti-drug antibody formation 
The anti-drug antibody formation was infrequent and sporadic in  mice, rats and rabbits. Changes in 
exposure with repeated olipudase alfa infusions in  non-human primates were observed (decrease of 
30-50%  from the first  infusion to sixth and thirteenth  infusion) with  increased clearance and decreased 
half-life and correlated with increases in anti-olipudase alfa antibodies titres. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
General 
The pivotal studies in healthy animals were conducted according to GLP, as appropriate. With regard to 
the studies with  the disease model ASMKO mice , the applicant claims that all pivotal studies except 
one were conducted at the own testing  site and were GLP -compliant. However, as the testing  site was 
never actually inspected by authorities, the statement  of the GLP compliance cannot be confirmed. 
Nevertheless, considering the vulnerability of the test  model, precluding its shipment  and taking into 
account the overall quality of the reports, the studies can still  be accepted as reliable and sufficient for 
evaluation.  
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
A total of 26 acute toxicity studies with  olipudase alfa (rsASM) have been submitted  by the applicant, 
which were performed in rats, mice, dogs and the disease model ASMKO mice. Of note  is a much 
higher toxicity of olipudase alfa in  the AMSKO mice compared to normal mice and other species. Dose 
levels of ≥10 mg/kg caused lethargy and mortality in ASMKO mice, while the dose leve ls of 30  mg/kg 
were well tolerated by normal animals. In the deceased animals, hepatic ballooning degeneration and 
inflammation, hepatocellular apoptosis, adrenal co rtical degeneration/necrosis and adrenocortical cell 
apoptosis were evidenced together with  increased levels of liver enzymes and cholesterol. The 
applicant has stipulated that  this high  toxicity was caused by the  increased levels of ceramide, 
sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate in the serum catabolites of accumulated sphingomyelin.   
In order to further investigate the causes of the observed high toxicity in ASMKO mice, a number of 
additional non-GLP exploratory studies have been conducted. As sphingomyelin was shown to 
accumulate to a large extent in the spleen of ASMKO mice, the  applicant h as studied  the toxicity of 
olipudase alfa in splenectomised animals. The toxicity of olipudase alfa appeared to be somewhat lower 
in splenectomised animals, as animals treated with  10 mg/kg survived until the  scheduled termination, 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 32/136 
 
 
 
 
whereas in previous studies, the  dose of 10 mg/kg was lethal.  However, all splenectomised ASMKO 
mice receiving 20 mg/kg olipudase alfa still  succumbed to  toxicity, indicating that  splenectomy did not 
adequately protect against olipudase alfa toxicity. As sphingomyelin also progressively accumulates 
with  age, the  applicant has also performed studies with 22-28  weeks old ASMKO mice instead of 
standard 8-10 weeks old mice. No increased toxicity in older mice compared to younger mice was 
observed; however, the effects appeared to occur earlier in older mice compared to the younger 
animals. As TNF-α  inhibitors previously have been shown to replenish glutathione stores and  protect 
mice from ceramide and acetaminophen toxicity, additional studies were performed in the presence of 
N-acetyl-L-cysteine or S-adenosyl-L-methionine; however, none of the  substances has affected the 
survival or prevented adverse clinical signs. The toxicity was not  prevented when olipudase  alfa was 
administered subcutaneously instead of intravenously. An a dditional study with  heterozygous ASMKO 
mice demonstrated that  in such mice, toxicity of olipudase alfa was comparable to normal animals.  
No difference was seen between the toxicity of high and low molecular weight  olipudase  alfa. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat  dose toxicity 
Pivotal studies with olipudase alfa were conducted in rats, monkeys and the disease model ASMKO 
mice. In rats, IV bolus injection every other week for 26 weeks (14 doses) followed by the 4 weeks 
recovery period resulted in the NOAEL  at the highest tested dose  level of 30 mg/kg. Hypersensitivity 
responses were noted in mid- and high-dose animals, which is common for the administration of a 
human protein to rodents. No or minimal amounts of anti-rhASM  antibodies were detected in treated 
animals (titers < 1:1200-1:1600).  Liver analysis indicated a dose-related increase of olipudase alfa in 
the liver 24  hr post-dose; however, after 28 days, the levels were comparable to controls at all dose 
levels, indicating  the lack of accumulation of olipudase alfa in the liver. Other findings were uneventful.  
Similarly, administration  of rhASM to cynomolgus monkeys for 26 weeks every other week by 30  min 
IV injection resulted in the NOAEL  of 30 mg/kg as the highest  tested dose. Subcutaneous fluid 
accumulation at the catheter site was noted in a number of animals at all dose levels and was 
considered to be caused by catheter occlusion. However, this occurred with  low incidence, no dose -
response was seen and thus not  considered to be an adverse local reaction due to the test subst ance 
administration. A dose-dependent increase in the anti-rhASM  antibodies was observed at all dose 
levels after the 3rd administered dose, which was reflected in the decreased exposure to olipudase alfa 
after the repeated dosing compared to the first dose. Further findings were uneventful.  
Two pivotal studies were performed with  ASMKO mice, in which animals were dosed for either 12 or 13 
weeks every other week with 0,  0.3, 1.0 and 3.0  mg/kg olipudase  alfa. In both studies,  a dose-
dependent increase of anti-  olipudase alfa antibodies was observed at the end of the treatment and 
post-recovery. In the 12-week study, a minimal degree of the  adrenal cortical degeneration/apoptosis 
of zona fasciculata and a minor increase in the inflammatory foci within  the  hep atic parenchyma was 
seen in  the treated animals, consistent with  the adverse findings in liver and adrenals reported in the 
acute toxicity studies. The changes were reversible upon recovery and were not accompanied by 
changes in  the serum liver enzyme levels, and therefore considered non-adverse. These findings  were 
not noticed in the  13-week study. Instead, the decrease in the number and size of foamy macrophages 
and the decrease in the incidence and/or severity of cytoplasmic vacuolization was seen in  mul tiple 
organs and tissues of the treated animals compared to the  controls (liver, kidney, bone marrow, 
thymus, lymph nodes, adrenals, small intestine,  spleen, stomach, trachea, pancreas, cervix, ovary, 
uterus, epididymis), which was consistent with  the elim ination of sphingomyelin in this disease model. 
Upon recovery, the resumption of the accumulation in select tissues was seen (liver, adrenals, spleen 
and bone marrow), while the other tissues from the recovery mice were comparable to the terminal 
sacrifice mice. Reduced relative liver weights  were observed in both studies, which were likely related 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 33/136 
 
 
 
 
to decreased sphingomyelin content  due to  the treatment. Olipudase  alfa was detected in the liver of 
the treated mice in the 12-week study at the mid- and high-dose levels 24 hr post-dose; however, no 
detectable levels were noted post-recovery.  
As severe toxicity was seen upon administration of high doses of olipudase  alfa to ASMKO mice in  the 
acute toxicity studies, which the  applicant explained by the accumulation of the catabolites of 
sphingomyelin (ceramides, sphingosine and sphingosine -1 phosphate), the applicant has conducted a 
number of non-pivotal non-GLP studies in which  low debulking doses of olipudase alfa were first 
administered, followed by the administration of high dose levels. In the non-GLP study 10-00262, 
considered pivotal by the  applicant, a consecutive administration of four bulking doses of 3 mg/kg 
every other day, followed by subsequent administration of high (up to  30 mg/kg) doses of olipuda se 
alfa for 13 weeks (7  doses every other week) resulted in the  high dose levels being well tolerated. At 
all dose levels, a decrease in the number of foamy macrophages and a degree of cytoplasmic 
vacuolization in  multiple organs and tissues was observed, suggesting sphingomyelin clearance (as the 
study did not include untreated controls, the histopathological  findings were compared to the findings 
in the 13-week study 060301).  The sphingomyelin loads were determined in the liver, spleen, kidney 
and lungs following the treatment.  In the liver and spleen sphingomyelin levels after the treatment 
were almost negligible at all dose levels, whereas in kidneys , a dose-dependent decrease of 
sphingomyelin levels was seen. No significant reduction of sphingomyelin lo ad in the  lungs was seen, 
although a decreased lung weight following the  treatment suggests that a clearance may still  have 
occurred to some degree.  
Consistent with  the sphingomyelin degradation, increased serum ceramide levels were observed 
compared to the pre-dose and Day 9 of the study (after the administration of the 4th  debulking dose). 
Mild  to moderate leukocytosis and mild thrombocytosis were observed in several mice from all three 
treatment groups, which may indicate chronic inflammation. This correlated with  statistically significant 
increases in the serum amyloid A (SAA) levels in all dose groups at the end of the study and in 
statistically significant  increases in several cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-6, KC/GRO and RANTES on 
Days 53 and 93 of the study compared to the  predose levels. However, no adverse toxicological 
findings were noted, which could be attributed to  these changes.  
In summary, administration of olipudase alfa every other week for 26 weeks to  healthy rats and 
monkeys did not result in adverse effects at the highest  tested dose of 30 mg/kg. In the disease model 
ASMKO mice, no significant adverse effects were seen following administration of 3 mg/kg olipudase 
alfa every other week for 13 weeks. Administration of the low debulking doses of 3 mg/kg could 
prevent the  toxicity of the  high doses (up to 30  mg/kg) of olipudase alfa in this  animal model. The 
olipudase alfa administration decreased the number of foamy macrophages and the degree of 
cytoplasmic vacuolization in multiple organs and tissues of the ASMKO mice, consistent with 
sphingomyelin elimination; the process of accumulation resumed following the recovery period.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
The applicant has provided a justification  for why the genotoxicity studies are not  warranted for 
olipudase alfa. As the substance is a recombinant human enzyme for which  no DNA reactivity is 
expected, it  is agreed with the applicant  that genotoxicity studies ar e not warranted in accordance with 
ICH S6 requirement. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
The applicant has provided a justification  for non-performance of carcinogenicity studies with  olipudase 
alfa, based on the following: 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 34/136 
 
 
 
 
• 
There were no neoplastic or non-neoplastic proliferative findings in any nonclinical toxicity 
study conducted with  olipudase alfa, including 6-month  rat and monkey and a 3-month  ASMKO 
mouse repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
•  Olipudase alfa is a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase protein unlikely to be DNA -
reactive. The structure of the final drug product does not suggest that  the material has any 
mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. 
• 
It is unlikely that  rodents would be able to  tolerate chronic administration of olipudase alfa due 
to hypersensitivity reactions, even with  co-administration of diphenhydramine (DPH). Thus, 
long-term studies in rodents are not considered feasible. 
•  A review of the  published literature on acid sphingomyelinase and its relationship to tumor 
development or cancer was conducted and no relevant citations  were found. Furthermore, a 
review of the Pharmacovigilance Safety database for olipudase  alfa found no association to 
neoplasm formation. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental  toxicity 
The reproductive toxicity package included a fertility and early embryo-foetal development study 
(FEED)  in CD-1 mice, embryo-fetal development (EFD)  studies in CD-1 mice and NZW rabbits, and a 
pre- and post-natal  development (PPND) study in CD -1 mice. In the FEED  study, administration of 
olipudase alfa at dose levels of 3.16,  10 and 30 mg/kg/dose every other day by IV bolus injection 
during premating (M:  28 days, F:  15 days), mating  and until sacrifice (M:  D49 -53, F:  GD7) resulted in 
mortality at all dose levels which  was attributed to  hypersensitivity. It is noted that  most deaths 
occurred at the lowest dose level of 3.16 mg/kg (7 M/6  F at 3.16  mg/kg, vs 4 M/4  F at 10  mg/kg and 0 
M/0  F at 30  mg/kg). There were no effects on male and female fertility, including effects on the 
spermatogenesis, oestrous cycle, number of mated and pregnant females, number of implantations 
and corpora lutea, postimplantation  loss and the number of viable embryos. The most notable finding 
was the lower number of pregnant females (18/23)  and thus the reduced fertility  index (78.3%) 
compared to controls in the highest  dose group; however, it was still  within  the historical control range 
of the testing  laboratory (76-100%).  Based on the results of the  study, the highest tested dose level of 
30 mg/kg/dose is considered to  be the NOAEL  for fe rtility. 
In the EFD study in mice, administration of 3, 10  and 30  mg/kg/day daily from GD6 to  GD15 resulted 
in increased mortality (10/25)  in the low dose group. Eight of the  ten deceased females were pregnant 
and had litters which consisted of all non-viable conceptuses. Decreased activity was observed 
between GD14-16 and was considered to be caused by the hypersensitivity response. Anti -drug 
antibodies were detected in 47%,  20% and 15% mice from 3, 10  and 30 mg/kg/dose groups, 
respectively, with the  highest titers (100-800)  seen in the low-dose group. Serum concentration in the 
ADA-positive animals appeared to decrease by up to  73%; however, mean serum concentrations of 
olipudase alfa appeared to be unaffected, with  C max and AUC0-24 decreasing approximately dose-
proportionately with  the increasing dose levels.  
There were no olipudase alfa-related effects on any ovarian or uterine parameters. Statistically 
significant increase in the  number of early resorptions and post-implantation  loss and a corresponding 
decrease in the number of live foetuses per litter  was seen at 3 mg/kg; however, it  was within  the 
historical control data range (early resorptions: 1.4%; HCD: 0.6-2.%;  post-implantation  loss: 16.26%; 
HCD 3.9-23.2%;  life foetuses per litter: 12.0;  HCD: 11.2-14.0%).   The incidence of foetuses and litters 
with  open eyelids reached statistical  significance in  the 3 mg/kg/dose group; however, in the absence 
of the dose-response, the effect was not considered related to the treatment. Exencephaly was seen in 
2 foetuses/1 litter in the  10 mg/kg/dose group (incidence 0.8%  on the foetal basis and 4.8%  on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 35/136 
 
 
 
 
litter basis) and in 3 foetuses/1 litter in  the 30 mg/kg/dose group (incidence 1.0% on the foetal basis 
and 4.3% on the litter  basis).  The incidence of exencephaly was slightly higher than historical control 
data. The relevance of this observation for humans is unknown.  
There were 2 foetuses/2 litters  and 5 foetuses/2 litters  with  skeletal malformations in the 10  and 30 
mg/kg/dose groups. This included the malformations of ribs (absent, branched, and fused), skull bones 
(absent frontals and interparietals), and vertebrae (fused thoracic or lumbar arches, a thoracic or 
lumbar hemivertebra, absent thoracic arches, absent thoracic centra, fused thoracic centra, absent 
thoracic vertebrae). However, as the  observed incidence was comparable to controls (2 foetuses/2 
litters),  the findings were considered to be incidental. No  other notable developmental changes were 
observed. Based on the observation of exencephaly at ≥10 mg/kg/day, the low dose of 3 mg/kg/day 
was considered the NOAEL for developmental toxicity.  
In rabbits, decreased body weights and weight gains were mostly observed in the low-dose group 
(mean body weights between GD6-29 74%  of controls; maternal body weight  gains between GD6-20 
28% of controls). A reduced body weight  gain during the dosing period was also seen i n the high-dose 
group; however, to a much lesser extent (79% of controls between GD6-20), restored in the post-
dosing period (104%  of controls between GD6-29). Maternal food consumption was also reduced in the 
low-dose animals within  the dosing period (78% of controls within  GD6-20). Antidrug antibodies were 
detected at all dose levels, with  the highest  titers (400-3200)  observed in the low-dose-group. There 
was no obvious correlation between ADA results and the exposure to the active substance on GD12. 
There was no treatment effect on uterine and ovarian examinations; numbers of early and late 
resorptions, corpora lutea and the number of live foetuses were not statistically  different from controls. 
No foetal malformations were observed, which were considered to be related to treatment;  all 
observed malformations were not  dose-dependent, and their incidence was within  the historical control 
data. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was considered to be the highest  tested dose of 30 mg/kg.   
In the PPND study with CD-1 mice, administration of olipudase alfa at the dose levels of 0 (two  control 
groups), 3.16, 10  and 30  mg/kg every other day resulted in increased mortality of the dams in the 
low-dose group (5/25,  one additional female euthanized due to the aborti on of the litter). At  the 
highest dose level of 30 mg/kg, there was an increased number of dams with stillborn  pups (5 vs 0 
and 1 in controls); however, there were no dams with no liveborn pups, and the overall percentage of 
stillborn pups was not statistically  significantly increased. In addition, 2 dams of the high-dose group 
had a complete litter  loss on PND 5-21, and 2 dams of the low-dose group had a complete litter  loss on 
PND1-4 and PND5-21,  respectively. This resulted in significantly reduced lactation  indices of 87.9% 
and 87.7% at  the low and high doses, respectively. The litter loss was attributed to reduced maternal 
care due to hypersensitivity response, as the deceased pups had no milk in their stomachs. In the F1 
generation, two males of the low-dose group were euthanized in extremis on PND23. This was 
attributed  to the failure to thrive post-weaning, as these mice had the lowest body weight  and were 
from the  same litter. There were no adverse effects on sexual development and fertility of the F1  
animals and no effects on early embryo-foetal development of the F2  generation. No toxicokinetic 
measurements were conducted. There is also no information on the excretion of olipudase alfa in milk.  
In summary, olipudase alfa does not  appear to adversely affect the pre- and postnatal development in 
CD-1 mice when administered every other day during gestation and lactation up to the highest  tested 
dose of 30 mg/kg. Decreased pup survival and reduced lactation  index at the highest  dose level were 
probably secondary to the reduced maternal care due to hypersensitivity reaction in the dams. Based 
on this the  highest dose level of 30 mg/kg is considered the NOAEL for pre - and postnatal 
development.

2.5.4.6.  Tolerance  
The assessment of the infusion sites was incorporated in the repeated dose monkey study. Although 
liquid accumulation was seen in  several animals, this was considered to be related to the  catheter 
malfunctioning and not  related to the  test substance administration. No other test substance -related 
local effects were seen. 
2.5.4.7.  Other  toxicity studies 
A GLP-compliant hemocompatibility study in  human whole blood was provided. The test was done in 
triplicate using 0.9%  NaCl solution and 0.1%  Na2CO3 solution as negative and positive controls, 
respectively. The percentage of haemolysis was measured as an optical density at 545 nm. Based on 
the results of the study, olipudase alfa at a concentration of 1.1 mg/mL has no haemolytic effect (-
0.5% haemolysis vs 100% in the  positive and 0.0%  in the negative control). 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has provided a justification  that no environmental risk assessment is warranted for 
olipudase alfa, as it is a recombinant form of a natural human enzyme consisting of naturally occurring 
amino acids. Therefore olipudase alfa and its degradation products do not expect to present a concern 
for the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The applicant made use of a disease model for NPD, ASMKO mice. In this  mice model, the ASM 
enzyme is removed. The absence of ASM activity was confirmed in brains, heart, liver, spleen, kidney 
and lung. The characteristic foam cells were mainly observed in  bone marrow and spleen. In a 
moribund state, the animals had lower weight  and the main organs were smaller. The 
hepatosplenomegaly, characteristic of the disease in humans, was thus not  observed. In the brains, 
loss of Purkinje cells and atrophy of the cerebellum and midbrain were observed. In the animals, an 
increase in plasma cholesterol was also observed, but this was not  used as a marker of disease in the 
studies presented in this  dossier. The absence of ASM activity is also present in human s. However, the 
observation that  organs get smaller due to the  disease and the  absence of hepatosplenomegaly is not 
common to  human disease. Overall, it is regarded that  this model is suitable to  show proof of concept 
for the clinical use of olipudase alfa in NPD type B.  
The applicant notes that in  vitro preclinical studies were not performed as it was regarded not needed 
because of the animal study that allowed assessment of the activity in vivo. This reasoning can be 
followed, however information on the uptake and activity of the enzyme is considered relevant. The 
applicant refers to Section 3.2.S.3.1 - Elucidation  of Structure, Structure Function  Relationship for the 
in vitro characterization assay to measure cellular uptake of olipudase alfa. This document clarified that 
for olipudase alfa enzyme activity is shown in  the lysate of cells that  have taken up the enzyme. It is 
also shown  that uptake occurs via the M6P route, but  it is unclear in  which cellular compartment the 
enzyme is taken up. In addition, the applicant presents data on the  activity of the  enzyme at different 
pH.  While pH in early endosome is ~6.5,  late endosome ~5.5 and lysosome ~4.5, it  could be 
considered that  this enzyme is most active in  the late endosome. Bach et al., 1999 ‡  seem to suggest 
‡ G Bach  1 , C S Chen, R E Pagano, Elevated lysosomal pH in Mucolipidosis  type IV cells, Clin Chim Acta.1999

that  the pH in lysosomes of cells from Nieman Pick Syndrome Type C or Type A is in the  range of 4.3 -
4.5. As the in vivo data clearly show activity of the enzyme, olipudase alfa might  rather become 
activated in the late endosome. Indeed, in their  recently appeared review§, Breiden and Sandhoff refer 
to ASM as an endo/lysosomal enzyme. This would explain the in vivo observed effects considering the 
in vitro data on activity.  
In vivo, dose-dependent decreases of SPM were observed in ASMKO mice treated with  1, 3 or 5 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa. Whether these in vivo studies determine the final clinical dose regimen of 3 mg/kg QOW 
is not clear. In the  preclinical PK section, it  is noted that  The Cmax in humans cannot be compared to 
that  in the non-clinical species since the infusion rate is much longer in humans (220  minutes) 
compared to the non-clinical species (<30  minutes). The exposure (AUC) in the non-clinical species at 
a dose of 3 mg/kg is lower than that  in humans.  
A single administration  of olipudase alfa at  20 mg/kg results in a rapid increase in ceramide, 
sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate in the serum of ASMKO mice. There appear to  be two 
distinct  phases to the  generation of ceramide characterized by an early, rapid rise (2-45  min) followed 
by a second rise at 240  and 540  minutes postdose. S PH and S1P were significantly elevated at  240 
minutes postdose and SPH remained elevated at 540 minutes postdose. Sphingosine -1-phosphate 
levels returned to baseline at 540  minutes postdose. The two  phases of degradation products may 
indicate separate SPM breakdown events due to differ ent sources of SPM. The applicant notes that the 
early phase likely represents an “easy to  access” source that  olipud ase alfa can immediately target 
upon intravenous injection  (e.g. the  plasma membrane), while the  latter phase, which  takes several 
hours, may be due to tissue targeting. However, this explanation was not  understood as it was 
anticipated that  the enzyme is activated in the lysosome only. Upon  request, the  applicant provided a 
discussion on the activity of the  enzyme at different pH  and locations of SPM and of the enzyme. The 
initial  production of ceramide in ASM KO mice (5-45  min. postdose) is likely the result of olipudase alfa 
mediated hydrolysis of sphingomyelin that  is not  present in  lysosomes, but rather in an “easy to 
access” pool. It is unknown where this  pool may reside but  may include sphingomyelin found in  the 
outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or in  blood lipid particles. The early high peak of ceramide, 
following SPM degradation by olipudase alfa in ASM KO mice, was apparently not  observed in ASM 
patients. This is reassuring for the safety. The second and later peak of ceramide likely reflects SP M 
degradation in  the endolysosomal compartment.  
After a debulking regimen with  olipudase alfa (3 mg/kg QOD for four times),  all ASMKO mice survived 
the final 20 mg/kg olipudase alfa dose. The debulking regimen eliminated the toxic response to 
olipudase alfa, and elevations of ceramide, SPH, and S1P seen with  high  doses of olipudase  alfa. In 
addition, plasma ceramide, SPH, and S1P levels were significantly  lower than  those seen in historical 
controls up to 540 minutes.  In summary, the increased levels of ce ramide (C16) observed after a 
single dose of 20 mg/kg olipudase alfa to ASMKO mice that  are correlated with  increased lethality and 
poor clinical outcome are not  observed in C57BL/6  mice and can be eliminated by applying a debulking 
regimen. 
In ASMKO mice, high doses of olipudase alfa result in bradycardia accompanied by a statistically 
significant QT prolongation. This was composed of an initial  increase in the QT interval 80  min post -
dose, followed by a period where the  QT appeared to decline to a normal interval, and then a steady 
increase beginning 4 hours post-dose. The applicant provided QTc data. Also, QTc was significantly 
increased 5,6,7,  and 8 hours after administration of 20 mg/kg olipudase alfa. This is possibly linked to

the toxic effects of a single high dose of olipudase alfa. Patients will  not receive such a high dose. In 
addition, no QTc prolongation have been observed in the clinical study.   
When olipudase alfa was administered to normal rats, mice, and dogs, no toxicity was observed up to a  
dose of 30 mg/kg. However, high doses of olipudase alfa ≥ 10  mg/kg administered to ASMKO mice 
resulted in unexpected toxicity characterized by cardiovascu lar shock, hepatic inflammation, adrenal 
haemorrhage, elevations in ceramide and cytokines (especially IL-6, G-CSF, and keratinocyte 
chemoattractant [KC]), and death. These toxicities are related to the sudden massive degradation of 
SPM in the disease model, which do not occur in the wildtype animals as there is no SPM accumulated.   
Pharmacokinetics 
Olipudase alfa is a recombinant form of the  human enzyme acid sphingomyelinase and is administered 
to humans every 2 weeks as IV infusion over a dose range of 0.03 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg over a period of 
18 minutes to  220 minutes, respectively. The non-clinical kinetics of olipudase alfa were investigated in 
the non-clinical species CD-1, C57BL/6,  and acid sphingomyelinase knock out (ASMKO) mice, Sprague -
Dawley rats, New Zealand White  rabbits, Beagle dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys  following single or 
repeated intravenous (IV) administration over a dose range of 0.3  mg/kg up to 30 mg/kg. In the non -
clinical species, olipudase alfa is administered as a bolus dose or over an infusion period of <30 
minutes. Therefore, the Cmax in humans cannot be compared to that  in the non-clinical species since 
the infusion rate is much longer in  humans (220  minutes) com pared to the  non-clinical species (<30 
minutes) at a dose of 3 mg/kg. The exposure (AUC) in  the non-clinical species at a dose of 3 mg/kg is 
lower than that  in humans. 
Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicology package for olipudase alfa was conducted in accordance with ICH S6 
guideline for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals and included acute toxicity studies in rats, mice, 
dogs and ASMKO mice, 26-week studies in rats and monkeys and 12 and 13-week studies in  ASMKO 
mice; reproductive fertility study in mice; developmental toxicity studies in mice and rabbits and pre - 
and post-natal toxicity study in mice. The studies were conducted by IV bolus injection, with  the 
highest administered dose of 30 mg/kg corresponding to the 10-fold MRHD.   
In contrast to healthy animals, in which no clinical signs of toxicity were seen up to  the highest tested 
dose, acute administration  of olipudase alfa at dose levels of ≥ 10 mg/kg was lethal  in ASMKO mice. 
The applicant suggested that  this  was due to the  rapid formation of the  sphingomyelin catabolites 
ceramides, sphingosine and sphingosine -1-phosphate. This is confirmed by the submitted 
pharmacodynamic studies, which indeed indicate that increased levels of ceramides, sphingosine and 
sphingosine phosphate were measured in ASMKO  mice following olipudase alfa administration. The 
adverse histopathological findings in the deceased mice were observed primarily in the liver and 
adrenals and included hepatic ballooning degeneration and inflammation, hepatocellular apoptosis, 
adrenal cortical degeneration/necrosis and adrenocortical cell apoptosis. While  the liver is one of the 
major sites of sphingomyelin accumulation along with  kidney, spleen and lungs,  and thus  its high  local 
exposure to the catabolite products could be expected, the  mechanism of adrenal toxicity is less clear. 
The applicant states that the  observed effects are likely to be secondary to the generalized 
inflammatory reaction and ensuing hypotensive shock observed in these animals and not a direct effect 
of olipudase alfa. It is noted that  no additional  information is provided to  substantiate this  claim. 
However, it  can be agreed that,  as adverse effects of olipudase alfa could be prevented by using the 
debulking regimen in the repeated dose toxicity studies, these effects are not  likely to occur in patients 
for whom a debulking regimen of administration will  also be applied.   
Similarly to the  acute toxicity studies,  the repeated dose administration of up to 30  mg/kg olipudase 
alfa to healthy animals was well tolerated, without  notable adverse effects. The anti-drug  antibody

production was seen in both  species, which in the  case of monkeys was dose -dependent and resulted 
in the decreased exposure to olipudase alfa after the repeated dosing compared to the  1st dose. In 
ASMKO mice, the 12-week administration of olipudase alfa once every other week up to 3 mg/kg 
resulted in minimal/mild adrenal cortical degeneration and apoptosis in zona fasciculata and 
inflammatory foci in hepatic parenchyma, consistent with  the observations in the acute toxicity studies. 
However, the  findings were mild, and the dose of 3  mg/kg could be tolerated without  overt toxicity.  As 
high doses of olipudase alfa caused severe toxicity in ASMKO mice in the acute toxicity studies, the 
applicant has further conducted a number of non-pivotal non-GLP studies with low debulking doses of 
olipudase alfa were first administered, followed by the administration  of high  dose levels. It was 
observed that a consecutive administration of four bulking doses of 3 mg/kg every other day, followed 
by subsequent administration of high (up to 30 mg/kg) doses of olipudase  alfa for 13 weeks, indeed 
resulted in the high dose levels being well tolerated. Of further note is the observed decrease in the 
number of foamy macrophages and in the incidence and/or severity of cytoplasmic vacuolization in the 
multiple organs and tissues following  olipudase alfa treatment in ASMKO mice, which the  applicant 
explained by the sphingomyelin clearance. The effect was reversible after the treatment  was stopped. 
Consistent with  this,  increased serum ceramide levels were indeed measured in one of the studies 
using the debulking regimen. In addition,  mild to moderate leucocytosis and mild thrombocytosis 
statistically significant  increases in the levels of several inflammatory markers was also seen compared  
to the predose levels, suggesting  that a chronic inflammatory process may accompany sphingomyelin 
clearance. However, in the submitted  studies this was not  associated with  adverse toxicological 
findings.  
The determination of sphingomyelin levels in the liver, spleen, lungs and kidney following the 
treatment showed that  its load decreased to almost negligible in the liver and spleen, while in kidneys, 
a dose-dependent decrease was still  seen, but  the effect was less pronounced. However, there was n o 
significant reduction of sphingomyelin load in the  lungs  in the submitted  toxicological studies, although 
a decreased lung weight  following the treatment  suggests that  a cle arance may still have occurred to 
some degree. It is also noted that  no difference in the  number of foamy macrophages and the degree 
of epithelial vacuolisation was seen in the  lungs in two pivotal studies, in  contrast to other organs and 
tissues. Sphingomyelin clearance from lungs  was reported in one study submitted  as a part of the 
pharmacodynamics study package, in which  sphingomyelin levels in the  lung were reduced by 32%, 
61% and 58%  in ASMKO mice treated with 0.3,  1, and 3 mg/kg olipudase alfa every o ther week for 12 
weeks compared to the vehicle group. In summary, animal studies do not offer conclusive evidence of 
sphingomyelin clearance from the lungs by olipudase alfa. However, considering that clinically relevant 
improvement was observed in the clinical studies, this issue will not  be pursued further. 
As the active substance is a recombinant human enzyme, the applicant did  not submit any genotoxicity  
or carcinogenicity studies, which is in line with  ICH S6 requirements. However,  there is accumulating 
evidence that the  bioactive sphingolipids, such as ceramides and sphingosine -1-phosphate, play a key 
role as effector molecules that  regulate cell proliferation and differentiation and promote tumour 
growth and carcinogenesis. As these substances are formed upon degradation of the  accumulated 
sphingomyelin, which may lead to high local concentrations in multiple organs and tissues, the 
applicant was asked to discuss the potential tumorigenic risk due to  the formation of catabolites in 
patients following  olipudase alfa treatment  using public literature data. The Applicant stated that 
catabolite of sphingomyelin, sphingosine -1-phosphate (S1P) has been implicated in tumorigenesis, 
metastasis and angiogenesis; however, the production of this catabolite is expected to be mitigated by 
the dose escalation regimen and the action of endogenous S1P lyase, which converts S1P into 
hexadecenal and ethanolamine-phosphate. This is in agreement with  the results of a study submitted 
as a part of the pharmacodynamics study package in which  no increased levels of S1P were seen using 
the debulking regimen while significant  increases of S1P (although still  100 -fold lower than the 
circulating ceramide levels) were observed in mice administered a single high do se (20  mg/kg) of 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 40/136 
 
 
 
 
olipudase alfa. Based on this it  is concluded that  tumorigenic risk from the presence of S1P appears to 
be controlled in  patients due to the use of the  debulking regimen, which is confirmed by the absence of 
sustained elevations of S1P in  ASMD patients treated with  olipudase alfa.  
Olipudase alfa did not cause adverse effects on fertility,  embryo -foetal and postnatal  development in 
healthy animals when administered up to the highest  dose of 30 mg/kg. It is however noted that 
clinical signs of toxicity (mortality in mice, reduced body weight  and body weight gain in rabbits) were 
seen in  both species at the low dose level of 3 mg/kg/dose, which appears to correlate with  the highest 
incidence and/or titers of antidrug antibodies observed at this level. The Applicant stated  that anti-drug 
antibody responses to human proteins administered to laboratory animals are not predictive of similar 
effects in  humans, which is acknowledged.  
The applicant has submitted  a justification for a non-conductance of the juvenile toxicity study  because 
the most sensitive species, the ASMKO mice, has reproductive and neurological deficiencies, making 
them unsuitable for the study. Furthermore, as olipudase alfa does not cross the  blood-brain barrier, it 
would not  affect neurological development in juvenile animals. The mode of action of olipudase  alfa is 
established and is based on the degradation of the accumulated sphingomyelin; it  is thus not  expected  
that  this would be different in juvenile animals. Therefore the justification of the applicant is considered 
acceptable. 
As olipudase alfa does not cross the blood-brain barrier, the performance of dependence studies is not 
warranted. As the substance is a recombinant human enzyme, no additional studies with  metabolite s 
are necessary.  
The substance is a recombinant form of a natural human enzyme consisting of naturally occurring 
amino acids, the  use of which will  not alter the concentration or distribution  of the substance in the 
environment. Therefore olipudase alfa and its degradation products are not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics of olipudase alfa was only studied in  vivo in ASMKO mice at doses of 1, 3, 5,  10 
and 20 mg/kg. Treatment with olipudase alfa resulted in the degradation of sphingomyelin from the 
liver, spleen, kidney and lung, which  was most effective in  the liver (possible due to  high distribution  of 
olipudase alfa to the liver) and less effective in the lung.  Doses of 10  and 20 mg/kg were lethal to 
ASMKO mice but  not to C57Bl/6 mice. A 5 mg/kg dose seems most effective, but exposure in mice is 
lower than in humans. Increased ceramide, one of the degradation products, was observed in 2 -phases 
after treatment. The early, rapid rise was visible 2-45  min post-dose followed by a second rise at 240 
and 540 minutes post-dose. Also, large dose-responsive increases in interleukin- (IL) 6 and G-CSF 
were observed at 3 and 4 hours postdose and continuing  up to 9 hours postdose at  doses of 3, 10, a nd 
20 mg/kg. Smaller increases were seen in  IL-1α, IL-1β, and MIP-1α 3, 4,  and 6 hours postdose at 
these doses. Also, a decrease in heart rate and activity was noted for 3,  10 and 20 mg/kg whereas a 
QT prolongation was noted for the lethally dosed animals (10 and 20 mg/kg).  
The non-clinical kinetics were sufficiently investigated. At the clinically relevant dose of  3 mg/kg, the 
exposure (AUC) in the non-clinical species is lower than in humans. The Cmax in the non-clinical species 
cannot be compared to that  in humans since the infusion rate is much longer in humans (220 minutes) 
compared to the non-clinical species (<30  minutes).  
Overall, the toxicology programme demonstrated that administration  of olipudase  alfa to  the disease 
model ASMKO mice leads to the degradation of accumulated sphingomyelin, which causes severe 
toxicity when olipudase alfa is administered in  high doses. The affected organs are primarily the liver

and adrenals. While the liver is one of the major sites of sphingomyelin accumulation along with  the 
kidney, spleen and lungs, and thus its high  local exposure to the catabolite products could be 
expected, the mechanism of adrenal toxicity is less clear, but  could be secondary to  the generalized 
inflammatory reaction and ensuing hypotensive shock observed in animals . The toxicity of olipudase 
alfa can be overcome by the use of a debulking scheme when the administration  of high  dose levels is 
preceded by the  consecutive administration of several low doses. The degradati on of sphingomyelin is 
accompanied by the raised levels of its catabolite products ceramides, sphingosine and sphingosine -1-
phosphate in blood and an increase in the  number of inflammatory markers. This did not lead to 
adverse toxicological changes following a 13-week administration with  the debulking dosing regimen. 
The catabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been implicated in  tumorigenesis, metastasis and 
angiogenesis; however, the production  of this  catabolite is expected to be mitigated  by the  dos e 
escalation regimen and the action of endogenous S1P lyase, which converts S1P into hexadecenal and 
ethanolamine-phosphate. The clearance of sphingomyelin was seen as a decrease in the number of 
foamy macrophages and the incidence and/or the degree of cytoplasmic vacuolisation in  multiple 
organs and tissues; however, no consistent evidence of sphingomyelin clearance was observed from 
the lungs.  
As a recombinant human enzyme olipudase alfa is not expected to be genotoxic. Studies in healthy 
animals did not reveal adverse effects on fertility  and pre - and postnatal development. Antidrug 
antibodies were observed in all tested species. 
Overall, the non-clinical aspects of Xenpozyme have been adequately documented and meet the 
requirements to support this  application.  
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement  to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out  in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The clinical development program for Xenpozyme in ASMD includes 5 clinical trials with  olipudase alfa 
treatment (Table 2), 5 reports were submitted  with pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/ 
pharmacodynamic modelling data (Table 11), and 5 non-interventional natural history studies without 
olipudase alfa treatment (Table 4). The 5 clinical trials included a total  of 67 patients with  ASMD 
(47 adults,  20 paediatric patients).  The studies DFI12712 ASCEND and LTS13632 are still  ongoing. 
Of the 5 non-interventional studies, 2 completed natural history studies MSC12840 (SPHINGO -001-00) 
and SPHINGO00302 are included in  the dossier. The two non-interventional studies (MSC12840 
[prospective]) and SPHINGO00302 [retrospective]) are used for comparison with  the clinical data  from 
the paediatric patients. The NHC  studies will be helpful to inform on the  disease cour se in paediatric 
ASMD patients. 
The other 3 natural history studies are not included as they are ongoing or did not  provide additional 
relevant information on the disease.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods: 
For the analysis of olipudase alfa, 2 validated methods, both with  sandwich immunoassay format, were 
developed to quantify olipudase alfa in plasma. In the  first validated assay ITR -432-0409,  a mouse 
monoclonal antibody against olipudase alfa was used as the detec tion  reagent. Because the antibody 
used as the detection  reagent could no longer be supplied, the method was then redeveloped to utilise 
a rabbit polyclonal anti--olipudase alfa antibody for the detection step (method ITR -653-0813].  This 
method was transferred to an external laboratory and revalidated (method PDV0079). 
Validation proved that the  methods were specific, precise and accurate. Stability was shown  covering 
study sample handling  and storage. Cross-validation between methods ITR-653-0813 and PDV0079 
showed comparable results. 
Based upon the analytical reports, run performance was within  normal criteria. Furthermore, ISR data 
obtained by methods ITR-653-0813  and PDV0079 showed acceptable reproducibility. 
For the analysis of ceramide, lyso-sphingomyelin (lyso-SPM), chitinase, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 
18 (CCL18),  and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE ), validated analytical methods or commercials 
available assays were applied. Validation proved that  the methods showed acceptable performance and 
stability of the analytes. 
For the analysis of olipudase alfa IgG ADA in  serum, immunogenicity was monitored using validated 
ADA assays and followed a tiered bioanalysis approach of screening, confirmation, and titration. 
Immunogenicity was assessed using a validated ELISA method to screen samples for ADAs, and a 
separate immunoprecipitation assay was used to  confirm the specificity of the response. All assay 
acceptance criteria were met for the  assay parameters tested. 
Anti-drug antibody-positive samples identified with  the ADA assay were further evaluated for the 
presence of NAb,  both to inhibit  enzymatic activity and to inhibit  uptake into cells. The methods were 
validated and showed acceptable performance.  
An assay capable of detecting  NAb which inhibit  the uptake of olipudase alfa into cells was developed 
and validated using human acid-sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) primary fibroblast cells. Assay 
acceptance criteria were met for the  assay parameters tested. 
In the event that a patient experienced a moderate, severe, or recurrent infusion associated reaction 
suggestive of hypersensitivity, additional  blood samples were collected for the evaluation of anti -
olipudase alfa immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum tryptase, and complement activation. Samples were als o 
analysed for circulating  immune complex (CIC). IgE antibodies against olipudase alfa were quantified 
using an automated validated fluoroenzyme immunoassay using ImmunoCAP ® specific IgE technology, 
showing acceptable selectivity, specificity and criteria for the  assay parameters tested. For Serum 
tryptase, complement activation and CIC, commercially available standard CLIA methods were applied.  
PopPK, PopPK/PD analysis: 
A three-compartment PopPK model (report POH0494) was developed and validated for olipu dase alfa 
with  data from Phase I, Phase II, and Phase II/III studies conducted in paediatric (n=20)  and adult 
(n=49)  patients with  a dosing regimen, after within-patient  dose escalation, of 3.0 mg/kg every two

weeks administered through intravenous infusion.  This model, parameterized with  a first-order 
elimination process, showed good agreement between model-predicted and observed plasma 
concentrations. 
Inter-patient variability in model parameters, when estimable (for CL, V1, V2, and V3) ranged between 
14% (V3) and 24%  (V1). The residual (intra-individual) variability, modelled through a proportional 
error model, was moderate with  a ~23% CV. 
Time-varying bodyweight dependent allometric scaling factors on CL, V1, V2, and V3 were included in 
the model. Bodyweight was identified as a significant covariate. Moreover, the olipudase alfa 
manufacturing process was also identified as a significant covariate affecting CL, V1, and V2.  
The influence of anti-drug  antibody factors (status and titers)  on olipudase alfa PK  in ASMD patients 
was evaluated using the previously developed PopPK model POH0494.  The analysis (report SIM0475) 
was conducted using the same dataset (for patients of Phase I, II and III clinical studies) included in 
the popPK analysis POH0494. ADA status  was not identified as a significant  covariate. 
Furthermore, the analysis did not  indicate an effect of a different DLco, lyso -sphingomyelin, ceramide 
exposure and liver cirrhosis on olipudase alfa exposure. 
Three PopPK/PD models were developed and validated (report POH0712).  At the first  step, a PopPK/PD 
model was developed to describe the relationship between olipudase alfa plasma concentrations and 
reduction of plasma concentrations of the Lyso -SPM biomarker. At the second step, the predicted 
plasma Lyso-SPM concentrations were used to link the olipudase alfa treatment effect with  the time 
course of spleen volume reduction and recovery (increase) of DLco clinical endpoints.  
The relationship between the  plasma Lyso-SPM concentrations and the plasma olipudase alfa 
concentrations was best characterized by a turnover response model (type I  – loss of induction)  in 
which olipudase alfa plasma concentrations exerted an inhibitory effect on lyso -SPM production rate. 
The model was parametrized with  Tturn, the turnover time of plasma Lyso-SPM (Tturn being the 
reciprocal of the  first-order rate constant of lyso-SPM degradation Kout), Imax, the maximum drug-
induced inhibitory effect and IC50, the  olipudase alfa plasma concentration at 50% of maximum drug 
inhibitory effect. Visual predictive showed acceptable results. The covariate analysis indicated that 
body weight  was a significant  covariate for Imax, with  lower values in patients with  a higher body 
weight.  Imax was estimated to  be 0.953,  0.909,  and 0.893, respectively (10th, 50th, and 90th 
percentiles of the baseline body weight).  The Imax of 0.9  indicated that a near -maximal reduction in 
plasma Lyso-SPM was achieved. 
Additionally, age was identified to significantly  influence Tturn,  with longer Tturn observed in youn ger 
patients. Of importance, IC50 was estimated to  be 0.0003520,  0.00641  to 0.0154  µg/mL (10 th, 50th, 
and 90th percentile of the baseline body weight,  respectively), lower than the observed plasma 
concentrations over the 2-week dosing interval at the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg/kg in both adult 
and paediatric patients,  suggesting that  maximal reduction in plasma Lyso -SPM was maintained. None 
of the other tested covariates showed a significant effect on plasma lyso -SPM responses. 
The relationship between the  spleen volume data and the plasma Lyso-SPM concentrations was best 
described by a turnover response model (type III – stimulation  of induction) with  a stimulatory effect 
of plasma lyso-SPM on the  expansion rate of spleen volume. The model was parametrized with  the 
turnover time  of spleen volume ([Tturn],  the reciprocal of the  first-order rate constant of spleen 
volume decrease [Kout], and alfa the  coefficient of power function  effect. Visual predictive showed 
acceptable results. None of the tested covariate s showed a significant  effect on spleen volume. 
The relationship between the  DLco data and the plasma Lyso -SPM concentrations was best described 
by a turnover response model (type IV – stimulation  of loss) with a stimulatory effect of plasma lyso -

SPM on the reduction rate of DLco. In order to include patients with  missing baseline DLco values, a 
Baseline parameter was a priori included and estimated in the model. The model was further 
parametrized with  Kin, the zero-order rate constant of DLco recovery and alfa, the coefficient of the 
power effect function.  Visual predictive showed acceptable results. None of the tested covariates 
showed a significant  effect on DLco. 
An exposure-response analysis (report POH0610) was conducted to evaluate the relationship between 
olipudase alfa exposure (i.e., cumulative AUC over the 52-week treatment) and the efficacy endpoints 
spleen volume (% change from baseline in spleen volume) a nd DLco, at Week 52 for studies DFI12712 
ASCEND, DFI13803  Peds, and DFI13412/LTS13632.  Additional markers including platelet, hemoglobin, 
and hematocrit. The cumulative AUC over the 52-week treatment period were computed using the 
POH0494  PopPK model for individual patients following their actual dosing regimen. Considering both 
adult and paediatric patients, none of the responses of spleen volume, DLco, platelet, and hemoglobin 
(adult patients  only) had a clear relationship with  olipudase alfa cumulative A UC over the 52-week 
treatment period. 
In the modelling presented, the applicant  justified that the  analysis can be considered representative 
for commercial active manufacturing process.  
Absorption:  
The recommended starting dose of Xenpozyme is 0.1  mg/kg for adults and 0.03 mg/kg for paediatric 
patients, given every 2 weeks. The dose should be subsequently increased according to the  SmPC 
recommended dose escalation regimen up to 3 mg/kg. Infusion rates and duration of infusion depend 
on the dose.  
As olipudase alfa is administered intravenously, the absolute bioavailability is 100%.   
After IV administration, olipudase alfa Cmax values generally occurred at the  end of infusion, and 
thereafter plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner. Linear pha rmacokinetics for 
AUC(0- τ)  and Cmax is observed over the range of 0.3  – 3.0 mg/kg. Olipudase alfa pharmacokinetics 
shows a low to moderate between-subject variability of about 20 – 40%  for Cmax and 15  – 25% for 
AUC. 
No accumulation is observed after once every 2 weeks of dosing. After repeated doses at the 3.0 
mg/kg dose, Cmax and AUC(0-τ)  were comparable across different PK visits, indicating  no time 
dependency. However, in study  LTS13632, individual AUC0-τ  values following Q2W IV infusions of 3.0 
mg/kg in adult patients  showed increasing AUC(0-τ) values during the study period. A similar trend 
was observed in the  paediatric population. The applicant sufficiently clarified that  this  was due to a 
change in formulation from olipudase alfa during the course of the study.  After accounting for the 
differences in olipudase alfa exposure across different manufacturing processes, there were no 
apparent increases in olipudase alfa exposures when patients received the same proce ss derived 
product during the course of the study.    
The Q2W dosing was chosen based on non-clinical study results to maintain the  reduction of 
sphingomyelin. 
Comparison of AUC(0-τ)  between ADA positive and negative patients  showed similar AUC(0-τ)  at the 3 
mg/kg (IV Q2W) dose at each visit. There were no apparent effects of ADA on the exposure of 
olipudase alfa. 
Bioequivalence: 
During the clinical development of olipudase alfa, incremental changes were made to  the olipudase alfa 
manufacturing process.

The applicant has provided a comparison of pharmacokinetic data across manufacturing processes.  
Clinical data did not indicate a different efficacy when patients switched  to a different manufacturing 
process, and no difference in overall immunogenicity profile was observed. 
Distribution:   
Olipudase alfa, an enzyme, is not expected to bind  to plasma proteins, and as such, drug -drug 
interactions due to protein displacement are not expected.  
At the 3.0  mg/kg dose, the mean steady-state volume of distribution  (Vss) of olipudase alfa ranged 
from 0.148  to 0.181  l/kg (10.4-12.7  l in a 70 kg individual), which was confirmed by popPK analysis, 
i.e. 13.1 ±  2.3 l. These data indicate that  olipudase alfa is primarily distributed in  the vascular system 
with  limited extravascular tissue distribution. 
Olipudase alfa does not  cross the blood-brain barrier. 
Metabolism:  
Olipudase alfa is a therapeutic protein, and its  metabolism is expected to  be limited to  proteolytic 
catabolism to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Elimination:   
Olipudase alfa is slowly eliminated from plasma. At the  0.3 to 3.0  mg/kg dose, mean clearance values 
of olipudase alfa ranged from 4.5  to 5.2 ml/h/kg, which  was confirmed by popPK analysis, i.e. 4.7 
ml/h/kg in a 70 kg individual. The terminal half-life values of olipudase alfa ranged from 32 to 38  hours 
at the 3.0  mg/kg dose in the adult patient  population. 
Special patient  groups:  
Following  administration of 0.3, 1.0,  and 3.0  mg/kg olipudase alfa to  adolescents (aged 12  - <18 
years), children (aged 6 to  <12 years) and young children/infants  (aged <6 years), maximale 
concentrations are observed at about the end of infusion.  After the end of infusion, plasma 
concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner, with  mean t1/2 values ranging from 17.1 to 24.3 
hours. 
The popPK estimated plasma exposure indicated that  olipudase alfa mean steady -state AUC0-τ was 
about 13% lower in adolescent patients, about 26% lower in children and about 34% lower in young 
children/infants compared to adults. 
The lower exposure in patients with  lower body weight  (i.e., paediatric patients)  was not clinically 
relevant as generally consistent clinical responses of spleen volume reduction, and DLco increase were 
noted in these patients compared to the  rest of the patients.  T hese results support the current body 
weight-based dosing regimen for olipudase alfa (see clinical efficacy assessment).  
In line with  this, body weight appeared to be a covariate for olipudase alfa clearance. Increase of body 
weight  increases the CL and consequently decrease exposure parameters like AUC. However, an 
increase in body weight  due to the weight-based dose regimen increases the amount of injected 
enzyme and consequently an increase in AUC. As olipudase alfa is dosed based on the patient’s body 
weight,  as a result, following a 3.0 mg/kg dose regimen, the bodyweight effect translated into  an 
increase in 8% of Cmax and 16% of AUC0-τ  for virtual patients weighing  77.6 kg and a decrease in 
30% of Cmax and 40% of AUC0-τ  for virtual patients  weighing 19.0 kg, when compared to virtual 
patients weighing  58.0 kg. The SmPC recommends a dose cut-off for patients  with  a BMI>30  kg/m2; 
however, this  dose recommendation was not further supported. In its response, the applicant clarified 
that  as olipudase alfa is primarily distributed  in the vascular system with  limited  extravascular tissue 
Assessment report

Page 49/136 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution  and the lower blood volume per kg in morbidly obese patients  compared to normal weight 
patients, this  would potentially result in higher than  expected exposures in obese patients.  In study 
SPHINGO00605, 1  obese subject showed an almost 2-fold increase in exposure, and therefore a dose  
cut-off at 30  mg/m2 was applied in the subsequent clinical studies. Limited data in  obese subjects 
showed no difference in clinical efficacy. On request, this dosing regimen was further substantiated  by 
popPK analysis, showing that exposures in obese subjects with  a BMI of 40 kg/m2 would have resulted 
in an increased exposure by 35%,  while applying the  cut-off in dosing would result in a comparable 
exposure. 
No studies have been carried out in subjects with  renal or hepatic impaired function.  The dispositi on  of 
olipudase alfa is not expected to be impacted by renal or hepatic impairment. The population 
pharmacokinetic analysis did not  show a difference in olipudase alfa exposure due to renal or hepatic 
impairment (liver cirrhosis). However, the covariate analysis of baseline albumin, baseline alanine 
aminotransferase, baseline aspartate aminotransferase, and baseline total bilirubin  were not  
presented. Additional submitted  data showed no impact  of these covariates on olipudase alfa exposure.  
The population pharmacokinetic analysis did not show a difference in olipudase alfa exposure between 
male and female subjects, race (Asian/other; n=4),  and elderly (>65  years; n=2), although  it should 
be noted that very limited data were included. 
Interactions:  
Drug-drug interactions (DDI) via cytochrome P450  enzymes or transporters is not  expected, and 
therefore, no specific clinical DDI studies have been conducted with  olipudase alfa. Literature data 
indicate that  based upon in vitro data and in silico data, tricyclic antidepressants and some cationic 
amphiphilic drugs, including anti-histaminic  drugs, may decrease olipudase alfa activity. The 
interactions are sufficiently described in section 4.5.  of the  SmPC.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Olipudase alfa, developed as an enzyme replacement therapy to supplement deficient ASM in  ASMD 
patients, converts sphingomyelin into  ceramide. PD assessments in the clinical program for olipudase 
alfa included the  measurement of plasma ceramide and several biomarkers re flecting disease burden, 
namely plasma lyso-sphingomyelin (lyso-SPM), plasma chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 18 (CCL18), 
serum chitotriosidase (chitinase), and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).  
Ceramide is a direct catabolite of olipudase alfa-mediated metabolism of sphingomyelin and serves as 
a PD marker of olipudase activity in ASMD patients. 
Primary Pharmacology 
In ASMD patients  receiving an IV injection of olipudase alfa every other week, plasma ceramide levels 
showed transient post-infusion increases within  24 to  48 hours, with progressively lower pre-dose 
ceramide levels by the  next infusion. Both pre - and post-infusion  ceramide levels steadily decreased 
with  continued olipudase alfa therapy. Lyso-SPM, a deacylated form of sphingomyelin was substantially 
elevated at baseline and above the upper limit  of normal in plasma for both adult  and paediatric 
patients. After receiving an IV injection of olipudase alfa every other week, plasma lyso-SPM levels 
declined significantly following treatment with  olipudase alfa, reflecting debulking of sphingomyelin in 
tissue. This was confirmed by showing a reduction of liver sphingomyelin in liver biopsies. The change 
in mean pre-infusion plasma lyso-SPM from baseline to Week 52  was -78.0%  in adult  patients 
and -87.2%  in paediatric patients,  respectively. Serum chitotriosidase, plasma CCL18, and serum ACE,

the PD endpoints reflecting disease burden, were also reduced continuously over the  entire treatment 
period of olipudase alfa in both  adult and paediatric patients.   
Table 5  shows the  different key biomarkers/pharmacodynamic endpoints tested in adults (pivotal study 
DFI12712)  and in the open label study in paediatrics (study DFI13803).

A Pop PK/PD analysis was performed to characterize the relationship between  olipudase alfa plasma 
concentrations and reduction of plasma Lyso-SPM accumulation and subsequent reduction of spleen 
volume or elevation of DLco over the time course  of treatment with  olipudase alfa. 
The covariate analysis indicated that near-maximal reduction in plasma Lyso-SPM was achieved in the 
overall population, with  an Imax estimated to be about 0.89 – 0.95.  IC50 ranged from 0.000352  to 
0.0154  µg/mL, being lower than the observed plasma concentrations over the 2-week dosing interval 
at the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg/kg in both  adult and paediatric patients,  suggesting that  maximal 
reduction in plasma Lyso-SPM was maintained.  
Correlation between plasma Lyso-SPM decrease and spleen volume reduction or DLco improvement 
was demonstrated using indirect  response models with  a stimulatory effect of plasma Lyso-SPM on the 
expansion rate of spleen volume or reduced rate of DLco. No covariate was identified to impact either 
spleen volume or DLco responses driven by the plasma Lyso-SPM decline after the covariates had been 
integrated to account for variability in PK (body weight  and manufacturing process) and plasma Lyso-
SPM response (body weight  and age). 
Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Analysis of olipudase alfa in Adult and Paediatric Patients with 
ASMD 
The QSP analysis aims to assess the degree of mechanistic similarity of disease and response to 
olipudase alfa in paediatric and adult  ASMD patients  applying a QSP model of ASMD that  describes key 
pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of olipudase alfa. The QSP model was developed by 
integrating  various data sources such as clinical data from paediatric and adult ASMD patients  enrolled 
into Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 2/3  studies for olipudase alfa, along with  natural history studies 
AMSD patients.  These datasets were supplemented with  preclinical data and published studies related 
to sphingomyelin biology and ASMD. 
The QSP analysis supports mechanistic similarity of disease between paediatric and adult  patients. The 
only clinically meaningful difference identified was ASM residual enzymatic activity, which indicates 
differences in severity of disease burden, not  pathophysiology. Both modelling approaches 
demonstrated that the mode of action of olipudase alfa is similar between adult and paediatric 
patients. Based on these analyses, more severe patients (reflected by higher baseline values the 
different parameters for in the clinical data) observed in paediatric cohort tended to show greater 
response in PD markers of plasma lysosphingomyelin and ceramide , which is attributed  to a higher 
reaction rate of conversion of sphingomyelin, and not actual differences in the pathophysiology of 
ASMD. Overall responses to the  2 key clinical endpoints following treatment with  olipudase alfa are 
consistent between adult and paediatric patients. Furthermore, the QSP model predicts  olipudase alfa 
to be efficacious in debulking tissue sphingomyelin in  type A ASMD patients.  Analyses using both 
modelling approaches support the similarity of disease and response to  olipudase alfa between 
paediatric and adult  ASMD patients. 
The development of the QSP model is also published (Kaddi  et al., 2018). 
Secondary Pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was assessed in all clinical studies of olipudase alfa, which included active treatment 
of patients. For the adults,  the integrated analysis set consisted of data pooled for adult  patients 
enrolled in all repeat-dose studies (DFI13412,  LTS13632,  and DFI12712 ASCEND), while the paediatric 
analysis set consisted of data for paediatric patients  enrolled in DFI13803  Peds and LTS13632.

Overall, 60 ASMD patients (40 adult  and 20 paediatric) have received olipudase alfa for a median 
duration of 3.11 years (range 0.4 to7.8).  Overall, 48.3% (29  of 60  patients) of ASMD patients  (40% 
[16 out  of 40]  of adults and 65% [13 out  of 20]  of paediatric patients) developed treatment-emergent 
ADA while receiving olipudase alfa. The majority had a low ADA response (≤400),  with a median peak 
titer of 75 (range 50-3200)  for adults  and 200 (range 50-1600)  for paediatric patients.  Paediatric 
patients generally developed ADA in a shorter time period compared to adults (10 weeks in paediatric 
patients compared to 33.1  weeks in adults).  Overall, 15% of the overall treated population (9 out of 
60) developed NAb that  inhibited catalytic activity (4 adults  and 5  paediatric patients),  with 6  patients 
NAb-positive at only 1 timepoint while 1  adult and 2 paediatric patients  were persistent but 
intermittently  NAb-positive. No patients showed NAb that  interfered with  cellula r uptake.  
Anti-drug antibody effect on PK of olipudase alfa 
ADA status/titer  or NAb positivity did not have a meaningful effect on  olipudase alfa exposure in both 
adult and paediatric patients.  
Anti-drug antibody effect on plasma lyso-sphingomyelin 
Plasma Lyso-SPM was used as the clinically relevant PD marker to evaluate the impact of ADA. The 
mean baseline plasma Lyso-SPM was similar in adult  and paediatric patients who were negative for 
treatment-emergent ADA compared to those patients who developed treatment-emergent ADA. 
Overall, with  time, the decline in Lyso-SPM was similar between patients who developed ADA versus 
those who did not. At  Week 52, there was a similar statistically significant  decline in Lyso-SPM in adult 
and paediatric patients  regardless of their ADA status.  Patients’ Lyso-SPM levels continued  to decline or 
be stable beyond this time point,  indicating no impact of ADA on this PD biomarker.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions with  other medicinal products or substances  
No drug interaction studies have been performed. Because olipudase alfa is a recombinant human 
protein, no cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions are expected. 
Based on available publications of in vitro data, ASM activity may be decreased in patients due to 
concomitant ingestion of several classes of medications (e.g., fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, tricyclic 
antidepressants [e.g.,  imipramine, or desipramine]) (Gulbins et al., 2013).  These classes of 
medications have been prohibited in  olipudase alfa studies due to the  potential drug-drug interactions. 
The lists of prohibited concomitant medications are provided in clinical study manuals.  
Cationic amphiphilic antihistamines,  such as loratadine, desloratadine, astemizole, ebastine, and 
clemastine, may decrease olipudase alfa activity (Kornhuber et  al., 2010). Therefore, the need for their 
use in oral or IV administration should be carefully considered. There is no restriction on topical 
antihistamines. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
The impact of SMPD1 genotype (e.g. homozygous for Arg610del, heterozygous for Arg610del, and 
other variants) was evaluated on efficacy (spleen volume and DLco) and PD parameters (plasma lyso -
sphingomyelin and chitotriosidase). Overall, for both adult  and paediatric patie nts, where n >5, there 
was no major effect of SMPD1 genotype on efficacy or PD parameters in this subgroup analysis with 
limited sample sizes.  
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Plasma ceramide, a major product of olipudase alfa-mediated metabolism of sphingomyelin, increased 
transiently following each olipudase alfa infusion  in both adult and paediatric patients, signifying 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 54/136 
 
 
 
 
olipudase alfa bioactivity. A consistent decrease of mean plasma ceramide along with  plasma lyso -SPM, 
and other PD markers (chitotriosidase, CCL18,  and ACE) was observed with  olipudase alfa treatment 
over time, consistent with  the debulking of sphingomyelin and reflecting the  olipudase alfa mechanism 
of action. Liver biopsies confirmed debulking. 
The covariate analysis POF0712 indicated that  near-maximal reduction in plasma Lyso-SPM was 
achieved in the overall population, with  an Imax estimated to be about 0.89  –  0.95. IC50 ranged from 
0.000352  to 0.0154  µg/mL,  being lower than  the observed plasma concentration s over the  2-week 
dosing interval at  the maintenance dose of 3.0  mg/kg in both adult and paediatric patients, suggesting 
that  maximal reduction in plasma Lyso-SPM was maintained. No covariate was identified to impact 
either spleen volume or DLco responses driven by the  plasma Lyso-SPM decline after the covariates 
had been integrated to  account for variability in  PK. 
The developed QSP model is predictive of the pharmacodynamic effect of  olipudase alfa in ASMD 
patients. The model showed that  similar efficacy results in type A and/or type A/B patients can be 
expected. Therefore, the QSP model can be considered robust and well capable of predicting the 
treatment effect of olipudase alfa on the  visceral organs in all types of ASDM patients. From a clinical 
point of view, it can be expected that based on the MoA of olipudase alfa and the  ASMD disease 
pathophysiology, no large differences in the  clinical efficacy outcome are expected. Albeit, no effect is 
expected on the neurological symptoms, as olipudase alfa cannot  cross the BBB. Although the  QSP 
model is predictive for a similar PD effect in type A patients,  it is to be noted that  there were no ASMD 
type A patients  included in the clinical studies. Only a few patients  with type A/B were included 
(patients had some neurological symptoms), and most patients  had type B ASMD. Type A patients 
(infantile-onset)  have a rapid disease progression, with  death around the  age of 3 years.    
Given that,  to date, no treatment exists to successfully treat the CNS manifestations i n ASMD type A 
patients, olipudase alfa as a treatment modality in this severely affected subpopulation is undesirable 
from a clinical perspective and probably from a patients/caregiver perspective. The visceral 
manifestations may be alleviated and thus may  result in some extended life expectancy, on the other 
hand the CNS manifestations which are not treated (as olipudase alfa does not cross the BBB) will 
result in a severely handicapped child. By leaving the CNS related issues untreated, the  child 
eventually will  succumb. Therefore, the indication  excludes the treatment of ASMD type A patients, 
which is agreed. 
In the studies conducted, olipudase alfa produced by the target process was not used in the ascending 
dose phase. The drug made by different methods shows some slight  differences in AUC and Cmax. 
After accounting for the differences in olipudase alfa exposure across different manufacturing 
processes, there were no apparent increases in olipudase alfa exposures when patients  received the 
same process derived product during the course of the study.  Further, the  comparison of treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs), infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and hypersensitivity -related 
IARs across the manufacturing processes showed that  the overall tolerability was not meaningfully 
different and was comparable in adult  and paediatric patients. There appears to be no difference in the 
safety profile from the safety data across the manufacturing processes. 
The absence of DDI studies can be agreed with,  as olipudase alfa is a recombinant enzyme, such 
interactions are not  expected.  
No dedicated QTc studies were performed. Olipudase alfa as an ERT is not likely to cause QTc interval 
prolongation. In the clinical study, none of the  adult patients had an increase ≥500  ms in QTc (updated  
ICH E14 guideline), and none had a clinical event indicative of QT prolongation (see safety 
assessment). 
The applicant proposed to include in the SmPC that careful consideration of the use of tricyclic 
antidepressants and some cationic amphiphilic drugs, including anti -histaminic  drugs, is warranted as 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022

they may decrease olipudase alfa activity. This statement  is based on literature and on in  silico data. In 
the clinical program, some of these drugs were prohibited. As these are theoretical drug interactions, it 
is agreed not to include them in  the SmPC. The potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions of 
olipudase alfa with  two potential  functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase, citalopram and 
fluoxetine, were evaluated in ASMKO mice. Both drugs did not  seem to have an effect on the efficacy 
of olipudase alfa in the mouse model when co-administrated, however, some influence on the effect on 
the spleen could not be ruled out. 
Immunogenicity was assessed in all clinical studies of olipudase alfa, which included active treatment 
of patients. Overall, 15%  of the overall treated population (9  out of 60) develop ed NAb that inhibited 
catalytic activity (4 adults and 5 paediatric patients), with  6 patients NAb -positive at only 1 timepoint 
while 1 adult  and 2  paediatric patients were persistent, but intermittently  NAb -positive. None of the 
patients showed NAb that  interfered with  cellular uptake. Subgroup analyses between ADA -positive 
and ADA-negative patients on the efficacy parameters (reduction on sphingomyelin, spleen volume and 
DLco) showed no indication  that the  ADA -status had a relevant impact on treatment outcome (see 
clinical efficacy). Longitudinal  measures of plasma lyso-sphingomyelin for the 3  patients with  repeated 
NAb-positive results showed no marked effect of antibody -positive on the results; even after the 
development of NAb that  inhibited catalytic activity in these 3 patients,  the spleen volume and liver 
volume reduced, indicative of treatment response. For % predicted DLco, there was variability 
observed even during the visits with  negative NAb, and thus  there were no clear trends. Overall, the 
decline in pre-infusion plasma lyso-sphingomyelin and mean spleen volume was similar between 
patients regardless of ADA status. In particular, the 3 patients with  intermittent  positive NAb against 
catalytic activity had achieved treatment responses similar to the overall population. 
From the preclinical data and the  QSP model, a biphasic production of ceramide was observed. In 
ASMKO mice this was observed at non-clinically relevant doses in WT or ASMKO heterozygous mice or 
in patients  following administration of olipudase alfa. The data suggest that  the initial  production of 
ceramide in ASMKO mice is the result of olipudase alfa mediated hydrolysis of sphingomyelin that is 
not present in lysosomes, but rather in an “easy to access” pool.  It is unknown where t his pool may 
reside but  may include sphingomyelin found in  the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or in blood 
lipid particles. Studies to investigate whether olipudase alfa can degrade sphingomyelin in circulating 
LDL particles or at the  plasma membrane have not been conducted. It is agreed with  the applicant that 
the lack of both  early ceramide production in  ASMD patients and increased early IARs during infusion 
or shortly after the infusion, suggests that  if such degradation occurs, it does not  adversel y impact the 
safety profile of olipudase alfa. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The key biomarkers (chitotriosidase, CCL18, plasma lyso -sphingomyelin, plasma ceramide, ACE, and 
liver sphingomyelin) showed reductions for BL to week 52  in both adult and  paediatric patients. In 
general, it  is observed that under olipudase alfa treatment  up to week 26  marked reductions for these 
parameters are observed, thereafter reductions seem to plateau and remain at these low levels up to 
week 52 and beyond (data available up to week 232 for some adults).  As expected from the MoA all  PD 
parameters point in the  same direction, suggestive for improvement. In addition, liver histopathology 
samples confirm that under olipudase alfa treatment, debulking of sphingomyelin occurs, confirming 
the MoA. Notably, consistent  with  the observations on these biomarkers, reductions in spleen volume 
(which is one of the two primary endpoints)  and liver volume were observed in both the  adults (pivotal 
study DFI12712)  and paediatrics (Study DFI13803).

Although the  QSP model suggests that  olipudase alfa can be used for treatment  of the  visceral 
symptoms in  ASMD type A patients, like in  type A/B and B patients,  the indication is restricted to 
ASMD type A/B and type B patients only. This is agreed, as despite potential  beneficial treatment effect 
on the visceral symptoms, the  neurological symptoms are not treated – as olipudase alfa does not 
cross the BBB -  and treatment  for these patients seems not  desirable given the rapid fatal outcome.   
Overall conclusion regarding pharmacokinetics: The proposed posolog y in patients with  a BMI >30 
kg/m2 is sufficiently substantiated.  Further, no studies have been carried out in patients  with  renal or 
hepatic impaired function,  but the  disposition of olipudase alfa is not  expected to be impacted by renal 
or hepatic impairment. In addition,  population pharmacokinetic analysis did not show a difference in 
olipudase alfa exposure due to  renal or hepatic impairment (liver cirrhosis).  Drug -drug interactions are 
sufficiently described in the SmPC. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
•  Use of different manufacturing batches of olipudase alfa 
During the clinical development of olipudase alfa, incremental changes were made to  the olipudase  alfa 
manufacturing process and the different manufacturing process batches have been used in the clinical 
studies.  
As there were no important  issues with  respect to  the different manufacturing batches, this  will not  be 
further discussed in the  overview. Full details can be found in the  Clinical Day 60 Assessment Report.  
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study SPHING0605  was a phase 1,  single-centre, single-dose, dose-escalation study of olipudase 
alfa in adults with  ASMD. The tolerability and safety of olipudase alfa were evaluated after single,

ascending doses of olipudase alfa were administered to 11  adult patients with  ASMD. Doses 
administered were 0.03 mg/kg (3 patients),  0.1 mg/kg (3 patients),  0.3 mg/kg (2 patients), 0.6 
mg/kg (2 patients), and 1.0  mg/kg (1  patient). 
Eleven adults  with confirmed ASMD were treated in this  study , 6 males and 5 females, all white.  Age 
ranged from 18 to 54  years (mean 31 years) at the time of infusion. Nine  patients were diagnosed in 
childhood, the other 2 in adulthood.  Baseline ASM activity ranged from 6% to  29% of normal in 
peripheral leukocytes (mean: 16% of normal). 
Per the inclusion  criteria, all patients had a spleen volume at least twice that  of normal. One patient 
had had a partial splenectomy; the other 10 patients had fully intact  spleens. Liver volumes were also 
increased (mean 1.6  multiples of normal (MN)  ±  0.4 MN).  None of the patients had cirrhosis or had 
liver function  test values (ALT, AST, total bilirubin)  outside the range permitted at entry. Mean liver 
function test  values for the 11 patients were within  the normal range at baseline: AST, 45.5 U/L  (± 
28.6  U/L; normal range, 1 to 50  U/L); ALT, 50.6  U/L (±  36.4 U/L;  normal range, 1 to 53 U/L);  total 
bilirubin, 0.82  mg/dL (±0.37  mg/dL; normal range, 0.1  to 1.2 mg/dL).   
All but 1 patient  had a body mass index (BMI) that  was within  the  normal range (BMI < 30  kg/m2). All 
11 patients  had 2  identified mutations in the  SMPD1 gene. 
Results 
Plasma ceramide levels showed a temporal relationship to treatment that  also appeared to be dose -
dependent (see Figure 3 for by-cohort mean plasma ceramide levels over time). 
Figure 3. Ceramide  Levels by study cohort. 
Plasma and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected to  measure sphingomyelin levels to evaluate the 
mean changes in sphingomyelin in plasma and DBS by  dose cohort throughout  the study. The single 
patient in  the 1.0 mg/kg cohort showed a noticeable peak in sphingomyelin levels in both plasma and 
DBS at 72 hours post-infusion. 
The relationships between the baseline plasma sphingomyelin levels and the safety response 
biomarkers (e.g., peak plasma ceramide, total bilirubin,  and hsCRP) were difficult  to assess. Overall, 
there were no apparent correlations between baseline plasma sphingomyelin levels and safety 
response biomarkers when all patient  data were considered. 
Study DFI13412  was an open-label, multicenter, ascending dose study of the tolerability and safety 
of olipudase alfa in ASMD patients.  This ascending dose study was to  evaluate the safety, tolerability,

pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile of olipudase alfa in  adult patients with  ASMD. Repeated 
IV infusions of olipudase alfa were administered every 2 weeks for 26 weeks. Six patients aged 18 to 
65 years, inclusive, were studied. The study was designed to  evaluate a gradual dose escalation 
strategy as a means of providing safe and tolerable repeat doses of olipudase alfa to patients  with 
ASMD by slowly reducing accumulated substra te. Results of this study were used to refine the design 
of the planned Phase 2 study. 
Adults aged between 18  and 65 years inclusive, with  non-neuronopathic ASMD characterised by spleen 
volume ≥6 multiples of normal (MN);  diffusing capacity of carbon monox ide (DLco) measured at >20% 
and ≤80% of the normal, predicted value; and retained liver function,  characteri sed by alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤250 IU/L, total  bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/L, and 
INR ≤1.5. 
Results 
Pulmonary function tests (FVC,  FEV1, TLC and  DLco) 
At baseline, all patients  were within  the normal range (≥90%  of normal) of FVC, FEV1, and TLC and 
remained in this  range throughout  the study. Under treatment (baseline to week 26) the  lung function 
parameters improved FVC % predicted, +1.5  (6.5);  TLC % predicted, +3.9  (7.7);  FEV 1 % predicted, + 
0.6 (4.9)).  DLco % predicted improved by +13.4  (16.0)%. 
The applicant also investigated this  at the patient level (Table 6). The data indicates improvement 
based on the DLco predicted; however, none of these 5 patients switched  their initial severity 
category.

Ceramide 
Mean values for plasma ceramide increased following all olipudase alfa infusions and generally peaked 
at 48 hours post-infusion (Figure  4), signifying olipudase alfa bioactivity. During the dose-escalation 
period and the repeated 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa infusions,  ceramide concentrations measured pre -
infusion were attenuated  as compared with  values observed during previous study weeks. Similarly, 
ceramide concentrations measured post-infusion decreased throughout the treatment period.

Study Participants 
Inclusion criteria 
1. The patient is male or female, aged 18 years or older. 
2. The patient has documented deficiency of ASM as measur ed in peripheral leukocytes, cultured 
fibroblasts, or lymphocytes; and a clinical diagnosis consistent with  NPD B. 
3. The patient has DLCO ≤70% of the predicted normal value. 
4. The patient has spleen volume ≥6 multiples of normal (MN)  measured by MRI; patients  who have 
had partial splenectomy will be allowed if the procedure was performed ≥1 year before screening/ 
baseline and the residual spleen volume is ≥6  MN. 
5. The patient has an splenomegaly-related score (SRS) ≥5. 
Exclusion criteria 
1. The patient has received an investigational drug within  30  days before study enrolment.  
2. The patient has a medical condition,  including significant intercurrent illness; significant  cardiac 
disease; active hepatitis  B or hepatitis  C, or infection with  human immunode ficiency virus (HIV); 
malignancy diagnosed within  the past 5 years (other than non-melanoma skin cancer), or any other 
serious medical condition that  may preclude participation in  the study. 
3. The patient has a platelet count <60  x 103/μL  based on the average of 2  samples. 
4. The patient has an international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5. 
5. The patient has alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  >250  IU/L or 
total bilirubin  >1.5 mg/dL  (except for patients with  Gilbert’s syndrom e). 
Treatments 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio into  placebo (saline 0.9%  sodium chloride solution)  or 
3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa target dose. During the extension treatment period, only olipudase alfa was 
received. 
Dosing with study drug was by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (±3 days) from the date of the first 
infusion (Day 1).  The 52-week treatment period of the  PAP began on Day 1 with  the first infusion  of 
study drug. 
To maintain the double-blind, all patients  underwent escalation under the same conditions,  regardless 
of treatment assignment and according to the schedule provided in Table 8. 
All infusions were to take place in a monitored setting with  ready access to emergency resuscitation 
equipment and medications. One rechallenge each was allowed for doses administered at Week 0  (0.1 
mg/kg olipudase alfa or placebo) and at Week 4 (0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa or placebo). Patients who 
were unable to tolerate the re-challenge at those doses were discontinued from the study ; however 
this appeared not necessary in this study.  During the PAP and ETP, in-patient  hospitalization  was 
required pre-infusion and for at least 24  hours after the infusion during dose escalation (i.e., through 
Week 16 and Week 70,  respectively) and may be required at  the quarterly and yearly visits up  through 
the end of Year 2; in-patient  hospitalisation might  be necessary during quarterly and yearly study 
visits in Years 3 through  5. 
Home infusion during the extension treatment period (ETP) 
Home infusion was not used during the primary analysis period but could be  initiated in the  ETP during 
the COVID-19 pandemic by trained home nurses every 2 weeks (±3 days).  
Rescue treatment

For treatment periods during both the PAP and ETP, dose -limiting toxicity (DLT)  criteria were applied. A 
rescue strategy was provided during  the blinded period for patients who may experience significant 
clinical decline.  
Dose escalation 
A dose-escalation scheme was followed for dose selection (Table 8).  Patients were admitted to  the 
hospital during dose escalation (PAP and ETP) as described in the visit schedule. Dose escalation 
followed the criteria described in  Section 8.4.5.  Patients unable to toler ate the target dose received the 
highest tolerated dose once every 2 weeks for the remainder of the study. The minimum active dose 
planned to be administered was 0.3 mg/kg.  
The same dose-escalation schedule and conditions were applied for patients who crossed over from the 
placebo group to the active treatment group in the ETP. 
The following criteria determined the next dose of study drug to be administered, provided the  patient 
did not meet the DLT criteria. These criteria applied to AEs considered relate d to  study treatment: 
1. If the patient  experiences no AE or a mild AE, escalate to the next dose  
2. If the patient  experiences a moderate AE, repeat the same dose  
3. If the patient  experiences a severe AE, decrease to the prior dose  
If a patient  presented on the day of infusion  either with  an unresolved AE or an acute illness, neither of 
which met the  patient DLT criteria, then  study drug infusion may have been withheld  or administered 
at the discretion of the Investigator.

Randomisation, blinding (masking)  and Matching 
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to  study treatment or placebo. The design of the study requires 
patients to  be hospitalized for infusion, and the randomization happens when the patient  is 
hospitalized. 
The randomisation was performed centrally by Interactive Response Technology when the patient  is 
hospitalized, using blocks of 4, without  any stratification factors.   
Note: The first patient  was enrolled 18 December 2015; the last patient  completed the  primary 
analysis period in March 2021. In amendment 7, 1 Feb 2016:  The 1 mg arm had been removed,  
changing the randomization ratio from 2:1:2  to 1:1 during  the primary analysis period.  
During the PAP, patients,  Investigators, and the Sponsor study team were blinded to  the identity of 
study treatment; an unblinded team at the  Sponsor was in  place to m anage certain activities. Also, 
patients and Investigators did not  have access to the randomization (treatment codes) until after the 
database lock for PAP, and all patients  had undergone dose-escalation portion of ETP, except under 
specific circumstances as described below. The Sponsor was blinded until the  database lock for PAP.  
At the facilities where the PK measurements, ADA, and selected biomarkers were assessed, the 
samples were analysed prior to the database lock for PAP that resulted in unblinding  of responsible 
bioanalysts. 
A detailed operational plan was implemented to maintain  the blinding and access to restricted data in 
the study until  the patients,  investigators, partners, and Sponsor were unblinded.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
Efficacy populations 
Efficacy analyses will use mITT population unless specified otherwise.  
The modified intent-to-treat  (mITT) population:  randomized patients who received at least 1 infusion, 
partial or total.   
The per-protocol population is a subset of the  mITT population that  has no critical or major protocol 
deviations that  are expected to  interfere with  assessments of the  primary efficacy endpoints (the  list to 
be finalized before the database lock and unblinding  in PAP). 
The mITT-C population is the  subset of mITT population which excludes patients  who had exposure to 
non-commercial scale material of olipudase alfa in  the active treatment  group. 
Rescue therapy population:  patients who had rescue therapy initiated in the  PAP. Since in the  ETP  all 
subjects get olipudase alfa, the rescue therapy was relevant only for the PAP. 
Safety population 
The safety population included randomized patients  who received at least 1 infusion (partial or total). 
In this population,  patients were analysed according to the actual treatment received during the PAP, 
irrespective of the  treatment patients who received at least 1 infusion (partial or total). In this 
population patients  were analysed in the treatment  group to which  they were randomized. This was the 
primary population for the efficacy analysis.

For the efficacy populations (mITT / PP) patients  were analysed in the treatment  group to  which they 
are randomized, for the safety population,  patients were analysed according to the actual treatment 
received.  
Primary outcomes and hypothesis tested 
Two primary outcomes have been defined, the percentage change in predicted DLco and the 
percentage change in spleen volume. The overall 5% significance level for the two hypothesis tests will 
be maintained using the Hochberg method; if the highest p <0.05,  both DLco and spleen volume are 
significant. If a higher p-value >=0.05,  and a lower p-value <0.025, then  the endpoint associated with 
a lower p-value is significant, but  one associated with  a higher p-value is not significant.  For Europe 
and ROW: from the sponsor perspective, the study will be declared positive if at  least one of the 
primary endpoints is statistically significant  by the  above method. 
Efficacy analyses used the mITT population  unless specified otherwise. This include d patients  who used 
rescue therapy, but their data after rescue was NOT  included in the analysis. Sensitivity analyses, 
including data beyond rescue therapy , was undertaken if appropriate.  
DLco 
The percentage change in DLco  (% predicted) from baseline to 52 weeks was analysed in the mITT 
population using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM),  including baseline DLco, baseline age, 
treatment arm, study visit, and study visit by treatment arm inte raction  as covariates; have an 
unstructured variance-covariance matrix; and be fit using restricted maximum likelihood estimation.   
If this model fails to  converge, the following  variance -covariance structures were tested in this  order: 
Toeplitz (equal variances and a separate correlation for each level of separation between the time 
points), AR(1) (first-order autoregressive, equal variances, and exponentially decreasing correlations), 
CS (compound symmetry, equal variances and equal pairwise correlations  across fixed time points). 
The first (co)variance structure yielding convergence was used as the primary analysis. 
Comparisons between treatment arms were made using least-square mean contrasts at the 52-week 
visit with  denominator degrees of freedom estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation.  
The MMRM  assumes data missing-at-random (MAR) and included all DLco observations except for 
measurements made after the initiation  of rescue therapy. In addition,  for patients who  do not  have 
Week 52 value available but have a PFT value measured after Week 38 infusion (e .g, patients 
discontinuing  the study or initiating  rescue therapy after Week 38 but  before Week 52 may have the 
PFT measurements available from early discontinuation  visit or right before rescue therapy starts), 
these values were used as Week 52 value for analysis purposes; Week 52  DLco will  not be considered 
missing in such situations.  This idea is based on the clinical concept that  PFT measurements are similar 
within  a 12-week period.  
In addition to evaluating the percent change from baseline, a responder analysis was performed to 
assist in the interpretation of a clinically meaningful result. International guidelines for clinically 
meaningful changes in DLco have been published for  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), including 
2017  Spanish IPF guidelines and the 2017 French IPF guidelines indicate a decrease of >15%  DLco in 
absolute values is associated with  an increased risk of mortality (Xaubet et al., 2017;  Cottin  et al., 
2017).  At the same time, the  Connective Tissue Disease - associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) 
-OMERACT CTD-ILD working group has a consensus guideline indicating that  a relative 15% change 
constitutes  a clinically meaningful change (Khanna et al., 2015).  In addition,  Pelligrino et al. (2005), 
set a clinically meaningful threshold at 10%,  and similar values in the  range of approximately 10-14% 
have been reported reviewing datasets from larger studies Horita et al., 2015;  Punjabi et al., 2003). 
Therefore, a responder analysis was performed using a threshold of 15%  improvement in DLco  from 
baseline. This means if a patient  has a change from baseline on DLco (% predicted) >=15%   at Week 
Assessment report

52, then  this patient  was a responder.  
A binary measure of responder (yes vs no) at Week 52  was analysed with  logistic regression, including 
treatment and baseline as covariates. Patients who had missing data at Week 52  were counted as non-
responder. The number and % of responders, as well as odds ratio, 95%  CI and p-value from the 
logistic regression model, were provided. 
Spleen volume 
The percentage change in spleen volume (MN)  and the change in the splenomegaly -related score were 
analysed using an analogous MMRM  model. Baseline values are generally the latest  value before the 
first infusion of the study drug, except for platelets and  haemoglobin, which  are part of haematology 
parameters; for haematology parameter baseline definition, pleas e refer to Section 2.6.1. 
In addition to evaluating the percent change from baseline, a  responder analysis was performed to 
assist in the interpretation of a clinically meaningful result. In Gaucher disease, therapeutic  goals for 
splenomegaly include a reduction in spleen volume of 30-50%  within  year 1 of enzyme replacement 
therapy (Pastores et al., 2004). Therefore a responder analysis was performed, setting  the threshold 
for response at <= -30% change from baseline in spleen volume at 52 weeks.  
A binary measure of responder (yes vs no) at Week 52  was analysed with  logistic regression, including 
treatment and baseline as covariates. Patients who had missing data at Week 52  were counted as non-
responder. Number and % of responder, as well as odds ratio, 95%  CI and p-value from the logistic 
regression model, were provided. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoints included the following: 
1.  The MMRM  described above was run using the per-protocol population.  This analysis will 
demonstrate whether the results vary depending on the population  analysed. 
2.  The MMRM  described above will exclude observations made after the initiation  of rescue therapy. As 
a sensitivity analysis, the observations collected after the initia tion  of rescue therapy was included 
in the MMRM;  the treatment arm for rescued patients  remained as randomized treatment.  The 
MMRM  planned for the primary efficacy analysis assumes MAR. To assess the  robustness of the 
primary results to that  assumption a pattern  mixture model was used (see Section 2.6.6  for 
details). 
3.  The MMRM  planned for the primary efficacy analysis assumes multivariate normality. To assess the 
robustness of conclusions under this assumption, nonparametric testing  method  was used: A 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW)  was used to compare the primary efficacy endpoints; missing 
Week 52 data will  be imputed  using LOCF, excluding patients who initiate  rescue therapy.  
Analysis of secondary outcomes 
The MMRM  model as used in the primary analysis of spleen volume under primary efficacy endpoints 
was used to  compare treatment groups for the following secondary outcomes from baseline to Week 
52, using  mITT population: liver volume, platelet counts, BFI -scale item 3, BPI-scale item 3, FACIT-
dyspnoea symptom score, splenomegaly related score. For all secondary outcomes listed supportive 
summary in mITT-C population were provided. Sensitivity analyses are not planned, but  may be 
undertaken if necessary. 
If statistical significance was reached on both  the DLco and spleen volume using the Hochberg method, 
then hypothesis testing  of the  secondary efficacy endpoints proceeded using sequential testing at 5% 
level with  the order as specified below. At any step when the endpoint is not significant  at 5%  level, 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 66/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the formal testing in subsequent steps would stop; the  p-values for the  subsequent endpoints in the 
sequence were considered exploratory, and hence interpreted at the nominal level. This controls the 
overall type I error level at  5%, using the closed testing principle. If either of the primary endpoints is 
not significant,  then hypothesis testing for the secondary endpoints was considered to be exploratory, 
and p-values were interpreted at the  nominal level.  
For Europe and ROW, the order of testing  for secondary endpoints is as follows: 
1. Percentage change in liver volume from baseline to Week 52 
2. Percentage change in platelet count from baseline to Week 52 
3. Change in BFI scale, Item 3 - from baseline to Week 52 
4. Change in BPI scale, Item 3 - from baseline to Week 52 
5. Change in FACIT-Dyspnea symptom score from baseline to Week 52 
6. Change in SRS from baseline to Week 52 
Interim analysis 
No formal interim analysis has been planned. 
Subgroup analysis 
The consistency of the treatment effect in PAP was evaluated for percentage change from baseline to 
Week 52 of spleen volume (MN)  by baseline spleen volume severity (severe, defined as >15  multiple 
of normal, vs not severe). For % predicted DLco by baseline % predicted DLco severity (severe vs no t 
severe, with severe defined as baseline % predicted DLco <40%). 
In addition, for the endpoints of percentage change from baseline to Week 52  of spleen volume (MN), 
SRS, and % predicted DLco, the  consistency of treatment effect in PAP was assessed by the  following 
subgroups: Baseline ALT or AST abnormality (ALT or AST ≥1 ULN  vs ALT and AST <1 ULN);  Baseline 
total bilirubin  abnormality (total  bilirubin ≥1.5 ULN  vs total bilirubin <1.5  ULN);  Presence vs absence of 
portal hypertension at baseline.  
Due to  the small sample size in  these subpopulations, treatment  differences within the  subgroup was 
difficult  to interpret. Therefore, the focus of these analyses was on the assessment of interaction 
between subgroups and the treatment.   
For each subgroup, same MMRM  models for the primary efficacy endpoints using data from the specific 
subgroup only were conducted to provide estimate of treatment  effect within  each subgroup. To assess 
the interactions between subgroup and treatment, the same MMRM  models for the prima ry efficacy 
endpoints were applied with  the addition of subgroup, subgroup -by-visit interaction, subgroup-by-
treatment interaction,  subgroup-by-treatment-by-visit interaction.  The p-value for overall subgroup-
by-treatment interaction, subgroup-by-treatment-by-visit interaction,  subgroup-by-visit interaction as 
well as the p-value for subgroup-by-treatment interaction at week 52 will  be provided.

Medical/surgical history 
Medical/surgical history findings  in the MITT population were consistent with  those expected in thi s 
patient population,  and none of the findings  were thought  to affect the validity or interpretation  of 
study data. The most commonly reported medical history findings  by body system were 
gastrointestinal disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, musculoskeletal  and connective tissue disorders, 
metabolism and nutrition  disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, and respiratory, thoracic, 
and mediastinal disorders. 
Medical history by SMPD1  variant 
Ongoing nervous system disorders were observed in 13.3%  of pa tients with  the pArg610del. No 
ongoing nervous system disorders were detected in  patients with  any other SMPD1 variant.  
SMPD1  genotype 
The variant pArg610del was the most frequent variant observed in 15 (41.67%)  patients. 
Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) genotype testing  showed 13.9% of patients were 
homozygous and 27.8%  of patients  were heterozygous for Arg610del, which  is the  most common 
mutation  in patients with  the chronic visceral form of disease. There was no specific trend noticed in 
the distribution  of severe cases among different variants. 
Renal function 
At baseline in  study DFI12712, most patients  had normal renal function  (CRCL (≥90 mL/min/1.73m2) 
(n=31;  86.1%).  There were 2 patients  each in the olipudase alfa and placebo groups that  had mild 
renal impairment (60  to <90 mL/min/1.73m2).  There were no patients with  moderate or severe 
impairment and none with  renal failure. 
Concomitant medication 
All patients in the  olipudase alfa and the  placebo group were taking at least one concomitant 
medication. Cardiovascular concomitant medications were used by 72% of patients in the placebo 
group (33% patients  had lipid  lowering agents), and 50%  of patients  in the  olipudase alfa group (28% 
patients had lipid lowering agents). 
One patient reported taking citalopram and another reported taking sertraline. Both antidepressants 
did not belong to the  group of prohibited drugs (tricyclic antidepressants) as defined in the  protocol. 
There are no data to indicate that  antidepressants other than  the group indicated by the  protocol may 
affect olipudase alfa efficacy.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 36 adult patients  were included in this  study; in placebo and  olipudase alfa 18 subjects were 
analysed in each group. In the olipudase alfa group 17/18  patients randomised to olipudase alfa were 
treated according to the  protocol versus 16/18  in the placebo group.  The applicant provided the 
number of patients  treated with olipudase alfa who received the different manufacturing processes.

Percentage change in %  predicted DLco  in the PAP + ETP  
At Week 52 (start  of the ETP), patients initially randomized to placebo had crossed over to  olipudase 
alfa and, by Week 104,  had also received olipudase alfa for 52 weeks. After 52 weeks of treatment 
with  olipudase alfa, the mean percentage change from baseline in % predicted DLco improved by 25% 
and 22% in the  placebo/olipudase alfa group (n=10) and the olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group 
(n=17),  respectively. This group of patients showed improvement in DLco at Week 104,  similar to the 
patients initially  randomized to olipudase alfa at Week 52.   
Figure 5 shows the mean DLco (%  predicted) over time.  
The decline observed at Week 184 in  the olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group is explained by the 
availability of data for only 1 patient  who missed 6 consecutive missed infusions from Week 174 to 
Week 184.

Prespecified responder analyses in PAP 
The prespecified responder analysis was performed, in order to assist with  the interpretation  of a 
clinically meaningful result,  using a threshold of a 15% absolute improvement in DLco from baseline. A 
total of 5/18  patients (27.8%)  patients in the  olipudase alfa group were responders versus none in the 
placebo group (0/18),  OR 14.4  with  95% CI 0.8-271.1.  Patients with  missing data at Week 52, were 
considered non-responders. Within  the group of responders heterogeneity was seen for other 
endpoints, pointing  in similar directions for improvements. At Week 104,  a post  hoc analysis showed 
that  8/10 patients  (80%) in the  placebo/olipudase alfa group and 7/10  patients (70%)  in the olipudase 
alfa/olipudase alfa group were responders. 
Percentage  change  in spleen volume 
Percentage change in spleen volume from baseline to Week 52  in PAP 
The mean spleen volume (calculated in MN)  at baseline was similar between the  olipudase alfa 
(mean=11.7 MN)  and placebo (mean=11.2  MN)  groups, indicating  moderate splenomegaly. Using 
MMRM,  during PAP in mITT population,  the LS mean percentage change in spleen volume MN  from 
baseline to Week 52 demonstrated a reduction in the olipudase alfa group (39.5%)  compared to an 
increase in the placebo group (0.5%);  resulting in a difference of -39.9% (p <0.0001).  The results 
remain statistically  significant after multiplicity  adjustment. Some improvement was seen already at 
Week 26, suggesting  an early response.

Percentage change in spleen volume in PAP + ETP  
Patients initially randomized to placebo who crossed over to olipudase alfa showed improvement in 
spleen volume after 52  weeks (thus Week 104)  of treatment. This was similar to  the patients initially 
randomized to olipudase alfa in the  PAP. At Week 104,  the LS mean percentage change in spleen 
volume from baseline in the placebo/olipudase alfa group patients  (n=11)  was reduced by 35.9%  and 
by 47.0% in the  olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group (n=14).  A further reduction was seen at Week 132 
with  43.0% in  the placebo/olipudase alfa group (n=11)  and 52.18%  in the  olipudase alfa/olipudase 
alfa group (n=13),  and at Week 156,  the LS mean percentage change in splee n volume from baseline 
in the placebo/olipudase alfa group patients  (n=8) was reduced by 48.6%  and by 49.9%  in the 
olipudase alfa/ olipudase alfa group (n=6). 
Prespecified responder analyses in PAP 
In order to assist with  the interpretation of a clinically meaningful result, a patient was considered a 
responder if the patient had a reduction of ≥30% in the  spleen volume (MN)  at  Week  52. A total of 
17/18  patients (94.4%)  in the olipudase alfa group and none in  the placebo group were responders. 
Secondary endpoints  
The order of testing for secondary endpoints is as follows: 
1. Percentage change in liver volume from baseline to Week 52 
2. Percentage change in platelet count from baseline to Week 52 
3. Change in BFI scale, Item 3 - from baseline to Week 52 
4. Change in BPI scale, Item 3 - from baseline to Week 52 
5. Change in FACIT-Dyspnoea symptom score from baseline to Week 52 
6. Change in SRS from baseline to Week 52

In the PAP, the  mean liver volume (calculated in MN)  at  baseline was similar between the olipudase 
alfa (mean=1.44 MN)  and placebo (mean=1.6 MN)  groups, indicating moderate hepatomegaly. The LS 
mean percentage change in liver volume from baseline to Week  52 demonstrated greater reduction in 
the olipudase alfa group (28.0%)  compared to the placebo group (1.5%,  p <0.0001).  The results 
remain statistically  significant after multiplicity  adjustment. 
The improvement from baseline was observed for the  percentage change in liver volume at Week 26 
with  greater improvement in olipudase alfa compared with  placebo (nominal p-value <0.0001), 
suggesting an early response. 
At Week 52 (start  of the ETP), patients initially randomized to placebo had crossed over to  olipudase 
alfa and by Week 104,  had also received olipudase alfa for 52 weeks. This group of patients showed 
improvement in liver volume at Week 104,  similar to  the patients initially randomized to  olipudase alfa 
at Week 52.   
At Week 104,  the LS mean percentage reduction in spleen volume from baseline was 30.66% in  th e 
placebo/olipudase alfa group patients (n=11),  and by 33.42% in  the olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa 
group (n=14),  a further reduction from 26.52% at  Week 52. A further reduction of 30.94%  was seen 
at Week 132  in the placebo/olipudase alfa group (n=11),  and a reduction of 35.22%  was observed in 
the olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group (n=13).   
At Week 156,  a further reduction of 34.39%  was seen in the placebo/olipudase alfa group (n=8),  and a 
reduction of 33.91% was observed in the olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group (n=6).   
Percentage  change  in platelet  counts 
In the PAP, the  mean platelet count at  baseline was similar between olipudase alfa (mean = 107.18  X 
109/L)  and placebo (mean = 115.6  X 109/L) groups reflecting mild  thrombocytopenia. The LS mean 
percentage change in platelet counts from baseline to Week 52 was greater in  the  olipudase alfa group 
(+16.8%)  compared to the placebo group (+2.5%),  p = 0.0185  (Figure 6) These results reflected a 
modest improvement in thrombocytopenia and remained statistically  significant after multiplicity 
adjustment  
The improvement from baseline for the percentage change in platelet count  was apparent at Weeks 26 
and 38 with  greater improvement in the  olipudase alfa group compared with  the placebo group 
(nominal p-values = 0.0013  and 0.0076,  respectively), indicating an early response.

At Week 104,  the LS mean percentage change in pre-infusion platelet counts from baseline was 
21.73%  in the placebo/olipudase alfa group (n = 15)  and 24.94% in  the olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa 
group (n = 13),  showing an improvement of the  thrombocytopenia in both  groups . Figure 7 shows the 
mean pre-infusion platelet counts  over time. 
At Week 156,  the sustained positive trend supports this  improvement despite the known interindividual 
variations of the platelets count,  13.59% in  the placebo/olipudase alfa (n = 9)  and 27.36% in the 
olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group (n = 6).

Change  from baseline in fatigue and  dyspnoea severity 
The mean fatigue severity at baseline was similar between olipudase alfa and placebo. Although there 
was a reduction in  fatigue in both groups, the LS mean change in BFI scale –Item 3 from baseline to 
Week 52 was not  statistically significantly different in the olipudase alfa group compared to the placebo 
group. Thus, hierarchical testing of the secondary endpoints stopped.  
Responses to the FACIT-Dyspnoea at baseline indicated the presence of floor effects as many patients 
reported no shortness of breath while dressing (45.2%),  walking 50 steps (29%), preparing meals

(73.3%),  washing dishes (73.1%),  sweeping or mopping (25%), making a bed (31%),  and carrying 
10-20lbs  (27.6%) (data presented in the separate Psychometric Analysis Technical Report; module 
5.3.5.1). 
The FACIT-Dyspnoea symptom scale score at baseline were similar between the  olipudase alfa and 
placebo groups. The LS mean change BPI scale –Item 3 and FACIT Dyspnoea symptom score from 
baseline to Week 52 (Figure 8) were not  different between the olipudase alfa and placebo groups.

Tertiary endpoints 
Several tertiary endpoints were evaluated. Only the  most important are presented here. 
Other pulmonary endpoints  
Pulmonary function  tests 
The means of pulmonary function  tests were comparable at baseline and reflected mild to  moderate 
disease. The mean % predicted FVC was 81.6% and 83.1%  in the olipudase alfa and placebo groups, 
respectively. The LS mean percentage change in % predicted FVC from baseline to Week 52 showed 
greater improvement in the  olipudase alfa group (6.8%)  compared to  the placebo group (1.5%),  with 
a difference of 5.28%  (nominal p-value = 0.0258). 
The mean % predicted FEV1 and TLC at baselines was 75.3% and 79.9%  in the olipudase alfa group 
and 78.6% and 77.9%  in the placebo group. Similar trends were observed for perce ntage change in % 
predicted FEV1 and percentage change in % predicted TLC from baseline to Week 52  (nominal p values 
>0.05).   
The LS mean percentage change in observed values from baseline to Week 52 followed a similar trend 
in FVC, FEV1, and TLC.  
PAP+ETP: At Week 156, the LS mean percentage change in % predicted FVC from baseline was 7.2% 
in the placebo/olipudase alfa group (n  = 5) and 12.4% in  the olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group (n  = 
5). The LS mean percentage change in % predicted FEV1 and TLC follo wed a similar trend. 
Patient global impression of change scale (PGIC) 
Change from baseline to Week 52 on the PGIC shortness of breath item was different between the 
treatment groups: Patients in the olipudase alfa group (n = 17)  reported greater improvement (LS 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022

mean =  1.11) than  the placebo group (n = 16, LS mean = 0.30)  (0 = no change, 1 = a little  better). 
There were no other substantial  differences in the PGIC items at Week 52. 
In addition, patients  were categorised as a responder at Week 52  if they reported an improvement on 
the PGIC (numeric value of 3, 2, or 1). Otherwise, patients were categorised as a non-responder if the 
numeric value was 0, -1, -2, -3  or missing. For the  shortness of breath item, the responder rate in  the 
olipudase alfa group was significantly  higher than  in the placebo group (61.1%  versus 27.8%). Th e 
treatment groups were not  different based on the  nominal p-values in other PGIC items at Week 52. 
Similar trends were observed on the PGIC items during the  ETP. 
Treadmill test 
To be noted:  the treadmill test was hampered by physiologically implausible data (~3%)  and missing 
data. The physiologically implausible data were excluded and the majority of the missing data was re -
captured by direct computation based on first physiologic principles  using primary data outputs  from 
the CPET evaluation. Lastly,  all predicted normative values were recomputed by a uniform set of 
equations. 
At baseline, the  mean values for exercise capacity determined from the  O 2 uptake at peak exercise 
were at  the lower limits  of normal in both groups and were similar in the placebo group as compared to 
the olipudase alfa group when data were expressed either as a % predicted normal or are normali sed 
to patient  body weight  (kg) or body surface area (METS): 
•  Mean calculated percent predicted O2 uptake (SD): 79.5  (30.8)%  predicted in the  placebo group 
(n=17)  and 78.2 (28.6)%  predicted in the olipudase alfa group (n=17) 
•  Mean calculated maximum oxygen uptake (SD): 28.4  (12.9) mL/min/kg  in the placebo group 
(n=17)  and 27.6 (10.3)  mL/min/kg in the olipudase alfa group (n=17) 
•  Mean calculated maximum workload (SD): 7.8 (3.6)  METS in the placebo group (n=17)  and 7.8 
(2.7)  METS in the olipudase alfa group (n=17) 
At baseline, subject effort was optimal in both treatment  arms. 
At Week 52,  the results in the placebo group from MMRM  demonstrated a reduction in exercise 
capacity that  was evident in every metric of maximal workload and achieved nominal statistical 
significance for most parameters (O 2 Uptake, calculated percent predicted O 2 uptake, calculated 
maximal oxygen uptake expressed as mL/min/kg, and calculated maximal workload expressed in 
METS). Based on the mean change in  the O 2 uptake at maximal exercise, there was an approximate 
26.5%  decline in exercise capacity at Week 52  as com pared to baseline in  the placebo group (mean 
change of -456.0  ml/min relative to  the baseline value of 1723.5  mL/min).  The results in the olipudase 
alfa group from the MMRM  demonstrated an increase in exercise capacity that was evident is every 
metric of maximal workload and achieved nominal statistical  significance for CO 2 Output.  Based on the 
mean change in the O2 uptake at maximal exercise, there was an approximate 8.0% increase in 
exercise capacity at Week 52 as compared to baseline in the  olipudase alf a group (mean change of 
147.3  ml/min relative to the  baseline value of 1852.9  mL/min).  
Comparison between the placebo and olipudase alfa groups at Week 52 demonstrated nominally 
statistically significant  improvements from baseline in  exercise capacity in  the olipudase alfa group as 
compared with  placebo that  was evident in calculated CPET parameters including  O 2 Uptake at peak 
exercise, calculated percent predicted O 2 uptake, calculated maximal oxygen uptake expressed as 
mL/min/kg, calculated maximum workload expressed in METS, and CO 2 Output.   
PAP + ETP 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 77/136 
 
 
 
 
During PAP+ETP, after crossover to olipudase alfa, all parameters improved in the placebo/olipudase 
alfa group. Specifically, at Week 104  an improvement in exercise capacity to values similar to, or 
slightly higher than baseline was observed for all metrics (n = 9).  Thus, the decline in exercise 
capacity observed during the PAP was reversed after crossover to active treatment in the 
placebo/olipudase alfa group. At Week 104,  the olipudase alfa/olipuda se alfa group demonstrated a 
progressive improvement in exercise capacity and it  was observed in all metrics (n = 7). Based on the 
mean change in the O2 uptake at maximal exercise there was an approximate 25.9% increase in 
exercise capacity at week 104 as compared from baseline in the olipudase alfa/ olipudase alfa group 
(mean change 480.0  ml/min relative to baseline value 1852.9  ml/min). Several tertiary endpoints were 
evaluated amongst others liver function  tests (e.g. ALT, AST, bilirubin).  The liver function tests showed 
consistent improvements in line with  the improvements of the liver (reduction of liver volume). A 
similar trend was observed for the  lipid profile, which  improved in the treated group.  
Ancillary analyses 
Ancillary analyses included investigation the impact of olipudase alfa produced by different processes, 
and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the  PD and efficacy parameters investigated in the clinical 
program. No impact was observed. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses supported the primary analyses.

•  Comparative  Paediatric Analysis of DFI3803  Peds Versus Natural  History Study 
(MSC12840) 
For the comparison of paediatric patients on olipudase alfa from trial DFI13803  Peds with  historical 
data from a prospective natural history study (MSC12840),  the following efficacy measures were 
compared: spleen volume, liver volume, platelet  count, % pre dicted DLco, ILD assessed via chest 
X-ray, ILD via HRCT, and height  Z-score. 
The data from 4 child patients  and 10 adolescent patients in  the MSC12840  study were compared with 
data from 11  child patients and 4 adolescent patients  in DFI13803 Peds. No statistically significant 
differences were observed in most of the demographic baseline characteristics with  the exception of 
age and sphingomyelin in plasma (551.3  mg/L overall in the  MSC12840 group versus 394.6  mg/L 
overall in the DFI13803  Peds group). 
Efficacy outcome data  over time 
Table 16  provides an overall summary of the comparative analysis of DFI13803  Peds versus the 
prospective natural history study MSC12840 for the parameters measured in both over the course of 1 
year.

2.6.5.6.  Supportive study(ies) 
Study DFI13803 
DFI13803  is a Phase 1/2,  multi-center, open-label, repeated-dose study to  evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, PK, PD, and exploratory efficacy of olipudase alfa administered Q2W  for 64 weeks in 
paediatric patients  <18 years of age with  non-central nervous system manifestations of ASMD. At least 
20 patients  were planned to be enrolled into 3 age cohorts and to  receive an IV infusion Q2W  of up to 
a target dose of 3.0 mg/kg (or their highest tolerated dose) following an intra -patient  dose escalation 
of at least a 16-week duration. Patients unable to tolerate 2 consecutive doses of 0.3  mg/kg olipudase 
alfa were to be replaced. 
The 64-week treatment  period allowed for a broader understanding of  olipudase alfa safety and 
tolerability in a patient population  that is undergoing rapid physiological change, relative to shorter 
studies. Depending on the  efficacy assessments, changes from baseline in exploratory efficacy 
parameters were evaluated through  52 weeks or 64 weeks of olipudase alfa administration. 
Over the conduct of the clinical program, incremental changes to  the manufacturing process were 
implemented.  
After the 64-week treatment  phase, patients  were eligible to enrol in the  long -term study LTS13632 to 
continue receiving olipudase alfa. The end of the  DFI13803 study was defined as the day that the  last 
patient entered in the LTS13632. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of  olipudase alfa administered IV in 
paediatric patients  Q2W for 64  weeks. The secondary objective was to characterize the PK profile and 
evaluate the PD and exploratory efficacy of olipudase alfa administered IV in  paediatric patients Q2W 
for up to 64 weeks. 
In- and  exclusion criteria 
Only the most important in-and exclusion criteria are mentioned (see CSR for full  details). 
Inclusion criteria 
1. Male or female <18 years of age on the date of signed informed assent/consent.   
2.. Documented deficiency of ASM consistent with  NPD, as measured in peripheral leukocytes, c ultured 
fibroblasts, and/or lymphocytes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 84/136 
 
 
 
 
3. Spleen volume ≥5 multiples of normal (MN)  measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 
patients who have had partial splenectomies were allowed if the procedure was performed ≥1 year 
before screening and the residual spleen volume was ≥5 MN. 
4. Patient’s height  was -1 Z-score or lower. 
Exclusion criteria 
1. The patient had received an investigational drug within  the  30 days before study enrolment.  
2. The patient had any of the  following medical conditions: 
a)  An active, serious, intercurrent illness; 
b)  Active hepatitis  B or hepatitis  C infection; 
c) 
Infection with  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); 
d)  Cirrhosis (determined by clinical evaluation); 
e)  Significant cardiac disease (e.g., clinically significant arrhythmia, moderate or severe 
pulmonary hypertension or valvular dysfunction, or <40% left  ventricular ejection fraction by 
echocardiogram); 
f)  Malignancy diagnosed within  the previous 5  years (except basal cell carcinoma);  
g)  Any other extenuating circumstance that could have  significantly  interfered with  study 
compliance, including  all prescribed evaluations and follow-up activities. 
3. The patient had acute or rapidly progressive neurological abnormalities.  
4. The patient was homozygous for SMPD1 gene mutations  R496L, L302P,  and fs330 or any 
combination of these 3 mutations. 
Treatment 
For all dose levels, dosing with  olipudase alfa was by IV infusion Q2W (±3 days). The dose escalation 
phase and the 64-week treatment period began with  the first IV infusion of 0.03 mg/kg  olipudase alfa 
on Day 1/Week 0,  and all subsequent olipudase alfa administrations were scheduled relative to that 
day. The dose escalation phase was to end with  the first infusion at  3.0 mg/kg or with  the identification 
of a patient-specific highest  tolerated dose.  
Patients who tolerated the 0.03  mg/kg dose at Day 1/Week 0 (one re -challenge of the 0.03  mg/kg 
dose was allowed) received a dose of 0.1  mg/kg 2 weeks later. Patients who tolerated the 0.1  mg/kg 
dose (one re-challenge of the first 0.1 mg/kg dose was allowed) received a dose of 0.3  mg/kg dose 2 
weeks later. Patients tolerating 2 consecutive doses of 0.3 mg/kg were dose escalated step -wise to 
receive 2 consecutive doses at 0.6 mg/kg, followed by infusions of 1.0  mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg, and to 
the final target dose of 3.0  mg/kg, which  was maintained for the remaining duration of the treatment 
period. Patients  unable to  tolerate 3.0  mg/kg olipudase alfa received the highest tolerable dose Q2W 
until  the end of the treatment period. Decisions regarding dose escal ations were discussed between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor upon review on an individual patient  basis.  
Patients were expected to receive IV olipudase alfa over a period of approximately 20 minutes to  3.7 
hours, depending on the  dose. The length of the infusion time was adjusted based on the patient’s 
tolerance of the infusion. In addition,  the mode of infusion included multiple steps starting  with  a slow 
rate of infusion  that was progressively increased, if there was no sign of poor tolerance.  
If more than 1 infusion was missed during dose escalation, the next dose was decreased by 1 level. If 
more than  1 infusion was missed after the patient has completed dose escalation, the  last previously

tolerated dose level of olipudase alfa was administered or the dose could be decreased by 1 level at 
the Investigator’s discretion. 
All infusions took place at study sites in a monitored setting with  ready access to emergency 
resuscitation equipment and medications.

All patients had their spleen intact at baseline. For only 9/20  (3 adolescents, 6  children) patients  the 
predicted DLco adjusted for haemoglobin was available at BL. 1 out of 3 adolescents had a DLco <40% 
(severe category). 
Despite the  small sample size of the study population, the  exploratory a nalysis of distribution  of 
selected baseline characteristics by SMPD1 pathogenic variants showed graphically that  patients 
carrying the c.1829_1831delGCC  (p.Arg610del) pathogenic variant trended to have a less severe 
disease than the  other patients  in the population investigated (e.g., later mean age of symptom onset, 
lower incidence of severe splenomegaly, higher incidence of higher height Z -score).  
Medical  history 
The medical/surgical history findings in the safety population  were consistent with  those e xpected in 
this patient  population, and none of the findings were considered to  affect the validity or interpretation 
of study data. Overall, the most commonly reported medical history findings by body system were 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders and Hepatobiliary disorders, which were reported in all patients. 
Prior and/or concomitant medication

Spleen  and liver volumes, and liver function tests  
Figure 9 displays the effect of olipudase alfa on individual spleen and liver volumes, respectively, 
expressed in MN  after 26 and 52 weeks of treatment. An effect of olipudase alfa could be observed in 
all patients from the first post-dose assessment at Week 26 on both spleen and liver volumes. After 
1 year of treatment (52 weeks), in the overall group (ie, all age cohorts combined), spleen volumes 
decreased by 49.2%  in mean MN  (individual patient  decreases ranged from 22.9% to  61.5%.

Pulmonary Function Testing 
The effect of olipudase alfa on % predicted DLco adjusted for haemoglobin is displayed by patient  in   
. After 1 year of treatment  (52 weeks), % predicted DLco adjusted for haemoglobin increased by a 
mean of 32.9%  (relative change from baseline) in 9 patients who were able to perform the  test at 
baseline (individual patient  changes varied from 0.7% to 91.7%)  which was significantly different from 
baseline. Of the 9 patients  who performed the test at baseline, 5 patients (55.6%)  had a change from 
baseline value on %  predicted DLco (absolute change) ≥15%  at Week  52.  
Improvements were also observed on % predicted FVC, % predicted FEV1, and % predicted TLC with 
mean percent change from baseline in  the overall group of 15.2%  (n=13 ),  9. 1% (n=13),  and 19.9% 
(n=8  ) at Week 52, respectively. 
Including 1 patient whose DLco was performed at the Week 64 visit but within the Week 52 analysis window as 
described in the SAP. Current data cutoff: 01Mar2021.

Cycle ergometry 
As in the pivotal study, ergometry (cycle) was also performed in some of the patients  (3 adolescents; 
2 children). In the 5 patients  who performed the test, a trend toward improvement on cycle ergometry 
was observed in the  following parameters: mean Maximum Workload (+31.2  Watts  overall at Week 
52), mean percent predicted Maximum Workload (+3.4%  absolute change overall at Week 52),  mean

Working Time (+2.8  min overall at Week 52),  mean maximum O 2 Uptake (+691.8  mL/min overall at 
Week 52),  and mean Maximum CO2 Output  (+561.2  mL/min  overall at Week 52). 
Height  Z score  
After 52 weeks of treatment, 15 patients  (78.9%) improved their  height Z score category and 4 
patients (21.1%)  remained in the  same category. Improvements in height Z scores were generally 
similar across all age groups. The mean overall increase was 0.56  at Week 52, and 0.78  at end of 
study at Week 64. 
Health  outcome questionnaires  
PedsQL Generic Core Scale and Multidimensional  Fatigue  Scale showed significant  improvement on the 
majority of subtests at Week 52 compared to baseline.  
For the Generic Core Scale, out  of the 6 subtests, 4 subtests  (Total Score, Physical Functioning, 
Psychosocial Health, Emotional Functioning)  had statistically  significant mean positive changes at Week  
52 in the  overall group on both child  and parent report measures. In addition,  the Week 52 mean 
positive change from baseline on Social Functioning  was also statistically significant on the parent 
reports. The School Functioning  subset was the  only one with  no statistically significant changes 
overall, neither in child nor parent reports. 
Regarding the PedsQL Multidimensional  Fatigue Scale, statistically  significant positive changes were 
observed at Week 52, in the  overall group compared to baseline, in 3  of 4 subtests in both child  and 
parent reports. In addition, the  Week 52 mean positive change from baseline on the  Cognitive subscale 
was statistically significant on the  child reports but  not on the parent reports (highest  baseline mean). 
Bone  biomarkers 
Mean bone-specific AP increased from baseline to Week 52 in all age groups except for the adolescent 
cohort. Mean (SD) percent change from baseline to  Week 52 was +32.4 (54.3)%  in the  overall group, 
-9.2 (50.6)%  in the  adolescent cohort, +44.8  (50.1)% in  the child cohort, and +35.0 (62.0)%  in the 
infant/early child cohort. 
Mean C-telopeptide increased from baseline to Week 52 in all age groups, with  a mean (SD) percent 
increase from baseline to Week 52 of 74.7 (70.9)%  in the  overall group. The mean (SD) pe rcent 
increase from baseline to Week 52 was 69.0  (93.7)% in the  adolescent cohort, 92.5 (78.4)%  in the 
child cohort, and 50.6 (37.0)%  in the  infant/early child cohort.  
Study LTS13632 
Study LTS13632 is an ongoing long-Term Study to Assess the Ongoing Safe ty and Efficacy of olipudase 
alfa in Patients With  Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency. 
Study design 
This study had a first interim database lock for with  a data cut-off  of 10  Dec 2019, for Regulatory 
purposes. The data presented in this  second CSR encompasses all the data up to the second interim 
cut-off date of 01 March 2021. 
All five patients  from the study DFI13412  and all 20 patients from the DFI13803 study were enrolled in 
this long-term follow-up  study. Patients were enrolled directly into  this study from their previous study. 
Enrolled patients will receive olipudase alfa every 2 weeks for up to 9 years, or until  marketing 
approval, whichever comes first.

Study objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to obtain data regarding the safety of olipudase alfa in patients 
with  ASMD who were exposed to long term treatment with  olipudase alfa. The secondary objectives of 
this study are to obtain data regarding the efficacy of olipudase alfa and to characterise olipudase alfa 
pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) following  long term administration. 
In and exclusion criteria 
Patients were included in  the study according to the  following criteria.  
I 01. The patient completed the treatment period of a previous study of  olipudase alfa with  an 
acceptable safety profile in the opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor.  
Any patient  who met the following exclusion criteria was not to  be enrolled in  the study: 
E 01. The patient  has any new condition or worsening of an existing condition  which  in the opinion of 
the Investigator would make the patient  unsuitable for enrolment or could interfere with the  patient 
participating in  or completing the study. 
E 02. The patient,  in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable to adhere to  the require ments of the 
study. 
Treatment 
Patients started this  study at the same dose they were receiving at the end of their original study 
provided that  they had not  missed more than  1 biweekly dose before the  entry into  this study.  
Home Infusion 
Home infusion was possible. Patients must  have met the eligibility requirements outlined below. In 
addition, the  Investigator and the Sponsor must have agreed that home infusion was appropriate. 
Quarterly visits occurred at the site.  If the site visit  was not  possible due to site closure or extenuating 
circumstances that  prevented an in-person site visit  (e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic) and home 
infusion was already approved for the eligible patient, quarterly visits were done at home.  
Outcomes  
Spleen  volume and liver volume assessed by MRI 
Spleen  Volume 
A reduction of spleen volume (MN)  was observed at all timepoints  starting as early as Month  6 and 
continued up to  Month 78  in the overall population. This reduction was observed in all patients as 
demonstrated in the by patient plot in  Figure 11. This reduction was sustained up to the latest time 
points for both adults and paediatric patients.

Additional analysis show that  the observed effect on reduction of spleen volume is similar in adults and 
patients and between the difference paediatric age groups (Figure 12). This will also add to  the 
extrapolation of the data from adults to the paediatric population.

Paediatric Subgroup analysis 
Analyses by disease severity 
In paediatric patients,  the effect of olipudase alfa on spleen volume (MN)  was also analysed according 
to the severity of the patient’s  baseline splenomegaly. At baseline, 12 patients  were categorized in the 
severe splenomegaly category (spleen volume >15 MN)  and 8 patients  in the not-severe category. 
By Month  24,  the mean percent reduction from baseline in spleen volume (MN)  was 65.2%  (SD= 5.1, 
range, -76%  to -59%)  in the severe category (11 patients) (p<0.0001),  and 55.0%  (SD= 9.3, range,  -
69% to  -42%) in the  not severe category (8 patients)  (p<0.0001). 
The results were maintained up to month  48, though patients  numbers were limited.  
Analyses by response to ADA 
The effect of olipudase alfa on spleen volume (MN)  was analysed according to response to ADA 
(positive and negative). A positive response includes 13 patients,  and a negative response includes 7 
patients. 
By Month  24  for 12 patients  in the positive group and 7 patients  in the negative group, the  mean 
percent change (reflecting improvement) in spleen volume (MN)  was similar (-61.8% [SD= 7.4, range, 
-71% to  -42%] and -59.4%  [SD= 11.0,  range, -76%  to -42%]  in the positive and negative response 
groups respectively) (p<0.0001). 
The results were maintained up to month  48, though patients  numbers were limited.  
Cycle Ergometry 
Cycle ergometry was performed every 6 months (starting  at Month  3 in this  study for paediatric 
patients) for the first 2 years in this  study, and yearly thereafter. For patients transitioning  from 
DFI13803  Peds, this assessment was not  required during the extension study in patients that  were ≤6

years of age or <120  cm in height on Day 1/Week 0 in the original paediatric study and was performed 
only in patients who have completed these assessments in DFI13803 Peds.  
Adult patients 
By Month  54,  mean (SD) workload increased by 12.4  (31.9) Watts  (range, -22 to 61)  for the 5 adult 
patients. Mean O2 uptake in adult patients  improved in most of the  visits with some fluctuations. By 
Month  54 mean (SD) O2 uptake increased by 169 (478)  mL/min (range, -507 to 678)  in the 5 adult 
patients. By Month  54, mean (SD) CO 2 Output increased by 279 (569.4)  mL/min  (range, -347  to 908) 
in the 5 adult  patients. 
Paediatric patients 
By Month  30,  mean (SD) workload increased by 87 (34)  for 3  paediatric patients (range, 61 to 125), 
while percent predicted workload improved by 10.7%,  (SD= 21.8,  range, -7%  to 35%). 
In paediatric patients,  mean O 2 uptake increased from baseline in all visits. By Month  30,  O2 uptake 
increased from baseline by 1442  mL/min (range, 948 to 1948)  for 3 patients. 
Mean (SD) CO2 output  increased in most visits. By Month  30,  mean CO 2 output  increased by 1557 
mL/min (430)  in 3 paediatric patients (range, 1268 to 2052). 
Retrospective NHC  study SPHINGO00302 
Title: A Retrospective Natural History Study of ASM Deficiency (Niemann-Pick Disease Types A & B). 
This study is published as McGovern et al. Morbidity and mortality in type B Niemann–Pick disease. 
Genetics in  medicine | Vol. 15, Number 8, August 2013. 
Only the high-level data is described, as for the benefit-risk assessment some of the  results were 
considered relevant.  
Study objectives 
The overall objective of the  study was to  define the natural history of ASMD (NP  Disease Types A and 
B). The specific aims of the  study were to: 
• Assess morbidity related to ASMD (NP Types A & B) 
• Estimate the  mortality rate of patients with  ASMD  
• Determine the causes of death for patients with  ASMD  
• Determine predictors of major morbidity and mortality among patients with  ASMD  
• Define, where possible, the  incidence and prevalence of ASMD in  the studied regions 
Each of the above objectives aims was examined both for the overall population of ASM deficient 
patients and separately for patients  with  NP Disease Types A and B.  
In this retrospective study 81 ASMD type B patients  were retrieved. The mean (SD) age at diagnosis 
was 9.3 (9.4) years. 29/81 patients are males (35.8%),  and 52/81 (64.2%)  are females. 
ASMD type B patients have several morbidities, of which Hepatobiliary Disorders, 
Respiratory/Thoracic/Mediastinal Disorde rs, Infections and Infestations and Gastrointestinal Disorders 
are amongst the most reported. These may be considered when reviewing the  safety data of the 
patients in  the clinical studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 93/136 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary causes of death for the 2 Disease Type B patients were  the renal failure secondary to 
hepatic failure in  a female adult  (42.8 years of age at time of death), and respiratory failure in  a child 
(2 years of age at time of death).  
Prospective NHC  MSC12840 
Title: A prospective, cross-sectional survey study to collect natural history data in  patients with 
Niemann-Pick B disease. 
This study is published as McGovern et al. Prospective study of the natural history of chronic acid 
sphingomyelinase deficiency in children and adults: eleven years of observation . Orphanet J Rare Dis 
(2021)  16:212. 
Only the high level data is described, as for the  benefit risk assessment some of the results were 
considered of relevance, notably this study collected 11 years of clinical data in 59 ASMD type B 
patients. More detail are available in the  clinical assessment report.  
Study objectives 
The objective of this survey study was to prospectively collect natural history data on patients with 
Niemann-Pick B disease of varying severity. The intent was to use the data to improve the  desi gn of 
future clinical trials that  will evaluate the safety and efficacy of olipudase alfa in patients  with 
Niemann-Pick B disease. 
This information is intended to: 
1. Determine the  range of values/performances of the planned tests in this  patient populatio n 
2. Help to  define the most appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria for future clinical trials  
3. Assist in choosing the best clinical endpoints for determining efficacy in future  clinical  
trials 
4. Help to  characterize and understand the natural history  of Niemann-Pick B disease 
Study design 
This was a prospective, multicenter,  multinational,  cross -sectional survey study to  collect natural 
history data in patients with  NPD B. Because little is known about the natural history of the disease, a 
prospective study design was chosen to ensure uniform collection of data in a well -controlled clinical 
setting.  This information was to  be used to choose clinical endpoints and surrogate markers to support 
the clinical development plan of olipudase alfa. Thus the clinical endpoints described in this  prospective 
NHC  study are in line with  the clinical endpoint used in the clinical program.   
Baseline  data 
At the baseline visit, patients were predominantly Caucasian (91.5%).  Approximately equal numbers of 
men and women enrolled. Mean age (SD) was 22.2  ± 13.84  years; median age was 17.0  years (range, 
7 to 64  years). Approximately equal numbers of patients were younger and older than  17 years. Of the 
30 paediatric patients (≤17  years old), 20  were male and 10  were female. O f adults, 11  were male and 
18 were female. 
Diagnosis 
The first symptoms and age of diagnosis for Niemann-Pick B disease occurred before 18 years of age in 
most patients. The mean age at symptom onset and diagnosis was 5.23 years and 10.08  years, 
respectively. The median age at symptom onset and diagnosis was 2.50  years and 5.50  years, 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 94/136 
 
 
 
 
respectively. At disease onset, the most commonly reported symptoms were hepatosplenomegaly 
(39%),  splenomegaly alone (6.8%),  and hepatomegaly alone (3.4%). 
Height  z-scores 
For the 6 to  11 year old group, mean height-for-age Z-scores were -0.9 and -1.1 at  baseline and year 
1, respectively. For the 12 to  17 year old group at the  same time points, mean Z -scores were -2.7 and 
-2.6.  The mean Z-scores at the final visit are not meaningful because data are available for only 3 or 
fewer patients. 
Lung function 
Most  patients had ILD and reticulonodular density (66%, 62%,  and 78%  at baseline, year 1, and the 
final visit, respectively). At every visit, a higher percentage of  patients had severe ILD and 
reticulonodular density as opposed to mild or moderate. The percentage of patients with  ILD increased 
from 66%  to 78% over the  study and the  percent of patients with  severe ILD increased from 42%  to 
50% of patients.  So this is indicative for disease progression. 
Ergometry 
Based on the prospective data on the ergometry , it is observed that  the % Predicted Hb-adjusted  DLco 
in patients  who had shortness of breath at baseline (n=25)  over the course of 1-year the DLCO 
remained similar, after 1 year 1 in  the final study visits a decline in DLco is observed, thought the 
number of patients  are limited. For those patients  who had no shortness of breath at BL (n=34) the  % 
Predicted Hb-adjusted  DLco also remained more or less constant up to  the final visit (Table 19).

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dose finding 
Study DFI13412 
This was an open-label, multicenter, ascending dose study of the tolerability and safety of  olipudase 
alfa in nonneuropathic adult patients with  ASMD (aged between 18 and 65 years inclusive). The in- 
and exclusion criteria are selected the patient  population intended to be treated. Patients with  a BMI 
>30 kg/m2 were excluded; however, patients with  a BMI >30  kg/m2 could be included in the rest of 
the clinical program. For patients  with  a BMI >30  kg/m 2, the dosing is based on body weight  (e.g. Body 
weight (kg)  to be used for dose calculation = 30 × (actual height  in m)2). Although there was very 
limited information to assess the effect of body weight  on olipudase alfa PK prior to the initiation  of 
pivotal studies, olipudase alfa exposures were ~2-fold higher in one obese patient (BMI 40.2  kg/m 2) 
with  0.3 mg/kg dose in the  first-in-human study (SPHINGO00605).  Therefore, olipudase alfa dosing for 
patients with  BMI >30  kg/m2 was limited to a dose corresponding to  a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 out of caution 
in the subsequent clinical studies DFI12712  ASCEND and LTS13632.  The provided clinical data support 
the dose recommendation in obese patients. 
Study SPHING0605 
This was a phase 1, single-centre, single-dose, dose-escalation study of olipudase alfa in adults. The 
in- and exclusion criteria selected the patient  population intended to be treated.

The tolerability and safety of olipudase alfa was evaluated after single, ascending doses of olipudase 
alfa were administered to  11 adult patients  with ASMD. Doses administered were 0.03 mg/kg (3 
patients),  0.1 mg/kg (3 patients), 0.3  mg/kg (2  patients), 0.6  mg/kg (2 patients),  and 1.0 mg/kg (1 
patient).   
Efficacy studies 
General 
Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered acceptable. The indication is “Xenpozyme is 
indicated as an enzyme replacement therapy for the  treatment of non-Central Nervous System (CNS) 
manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD) in paediatric and adult patients with  type 
A/B or type B”. This is acceptable. Although type A patients may also have some benefit from 
treatment in reducing organomegaly, olipudase alfa does not cross the  BBB and thus the severe 
neurological symptoms are not treated, adding only limite d contribution  to life expectancy. The 
applicant, therefore, restricted the indication to  type A/B and B ASMD.     
Pivotal study DFI12712 
Study DF12712  (ASCEND) is a double-blinded placebo-controlled study in adult ASMD type B patients. 
The eligibility criteria select the nonneuropathic visceral ASMD patient  intended for treatment. No 
exclusion criterion for the  absence of neurological symptoms is included. The study consists of a 52 -
week blinded primary analysis period (PAP) in which  patients were randomise d 1:1  to placebo or 
olipudase alfa. The PAP was followed by extended 52  weeks (ETP) of treatment  in which placebo 
patients crossed over to olipudase alfa treatment.  Patients were able to remain on the study after week 
104 in  a long-term follow-up part,  which is ongoing. The final study  results are awaited in  due time;  a 
commitment is provided. The PAP part of the pivotal study was finalised prior to the COVID -19 
pandemic. The applicant conducted post-hoc subgroup analyses based on the results from impacted 
patients with  unimpacted patients;  no relevant differences in efficacy between the two  groups were 
observed.  
Treatment 
The dose-escalation scheme – which was based on the experience in animal studies - as applied in the 
clinical studies is in line with  the proposed SmPC and is considered adequate.  
Preclinical data suggests that  a dose of 5  mg/kg body weight could even be more efficacious; however, 
this dose has not been evaluated clinically. This is based on the  preclinical data for which  i t was 
concluded by applicant that  a single dose of olipudase alfa as low as 1 mg/kg was highly efficient at 
reducing sphingomyelin levels in the  liver (76% reduction) and the  spleen (67% reduction).  Single 
doses of 3 mg/kg of olipudase alfa also significantly reduced kidney sphingomyelin levels (66% 
reduction, study 05-0129Pnp)  and a single dose of 5 mg/kg showed a significant reduction of 
sphingomyelin in the lung (43%  reduction, study 01-0220PnP).  However, results with  the 5 mg/kg 
dose in  the lung were variable and did not show a consistent trend over time.  
In studies testing every other week dosing for 12  weeks, sphingomyelin levels were reduced to the 
background in the liver and spleen, and substantial reduction was observed in the lung at 3  mg/kg 
olipudase alfa (Studies 02-1084Pnp  and 04-0813Pnp).  These data demonstrate that  the chosen dosing 
regimen of 3 mg/kg olipudase alfa every other week was highly effective at reducing and maintaining 
low tissue sphingomyelin levels in ASMKO mice. Extending the dosing regimen beyond every other 
week, to  every 21 days for instance, was not investigated as more substantial sphingomyelin re -
accumulation was observed at later timepoints  (>14 days) which  may lead to tissue damage.  
Therefore, the maximum dose was set to  3 mg/kg body weight and the dosing interval Q2W.

In SmPC section 4.2, an infusion rate/infusion time is recommended for each specific dose. Patients 
are expected to receive IV olipudase alfa over a period of approximately 20 minutes to 3.7  hours, 
depending on the dose to be administered. The length  of the  infusion time  was adjusted based on the 
patient’s tolerance of the  infusion. Given that  the rapid metabolism of accumulated sphingomyelin by 
olipudase alfa generates pro-inflammatory breakdown products, the stepwise manner of the infusion 
aims to minimize the risk of infusion associated adverse events. In the clinical program, accelerated 
infusion time was not tested (it  was possible to slow, pause or discontinue).  Based on the compliance 
measurements, it can be concluded that  compliance in both  adults and paediatric patients  was high.    
Endpoints 
The primary endpoints were 1) the  percentage change in % predicted DLCO from baseline to  Week 52 
and 2) the percentage change in spleen volume (in MN)  from baseline to Week 52. The use of these 
endpoints is in line with  the SA received and agreed upon.  
DLco was chosen as a primary endpoint because this  pulmonary function  test (PFT) reflects the 
underlying pathophysiological infiltration  manifested by disease foam cells and changes in DLco can 
objectively show the effect of olipudase alfa treatment  on lung  function and reducing local 
inflammation. For the prespecified responder analysis, an improvement of ≥15%  in DLco was set 
based on international guidelines on the management of lung fibrosis. In ASMD there are no data 
available that  directly support that  a 15% increase in DLco% is clinically relevant, therefore this  cut-off 
value was borrowed from other lung diseases, e.g. IPF and autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 
(PAP-1).  For instance, this ≥15%  improvement in DLco in IPF is linked to  a reduced mortality in  IPF 
patients. The applicant further substantiated  with literature data that  this 15%  indeed is considered 
clinically relevant. This approach and substantiation  are agreed; it is in line with  was requested during 
SA and the presubmission meeting. In addition  to the above, there are few data on the change in  DLco 
over time in ASMD in the literature. However, a spontaneous improvement of DLco (or other 
pulmonary parameters) in ASMD patients has not been reported in the li terature, nor has it been 
observed in the prospective natural history study (MSC12840),  therefore improvement in DLco is 
considered clinically relevant. 
For the reduction of spleen volume – the second primary endpoint-  the cut off value of a 30% 
reduction from BL to  week 52 was set for the  responder analysis. In Gaucher disease, therapeutic 
goals for splenomegaly included a reduction in spleen volume of 30-50%  within  year 1 of enzyme 
replacement therapy (Pastores et al., 2004). The 30%  reduction of spleen volume in ASMD can be 
considered clinically meaningful. Notably, spleen reduction can also be considered as a 
pharmacodynamic endpoint.  
In addition to the  two primary endpoints, secondary endpoints include, amongst others, reduction of 
liver volume, platelet counts, Week 52  change from baseline in fatigue severity as measured by item 3 
of the BFI scale, week 52  change from baseline in dyspnoea severity as measured by the Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Dyspnoea tool. Additional  lung function tests  were 
added as tertiary endpoints. The quality of life (QoL) measurements are of interest as they may help 
understand whether the treatment provides a relevant effect for the  patient regarding day -to-day 
functioning.   
Study DFI13802   
Study DFI13802 is a Phase 1/2,  multi-centre, open-label, repeated-dose study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, PK, PD, and exploratory efficacy of olipudase alfa administered Q2W  for 64 weeks in 
paediatric patients  <18 years of age with  non-central nervous system manifestations of ASMD. 
Enrolled patients were divided into 3 age cohorts (adolescents, child and infants/early child)  and 
received olipudase alfa per IV infusion Q2W of up to  a target dose of 3.0  mg/kg (or their highest

tolerated dose) following an intra-patient  dose escalation of at least a 16-week duration (in line with 
the proposed SmPC).  
In line with  the adult study, the paediatric patients also received IV olipudase alfa over a period of 
approximately 20 minutes to up to  3.7 hours, depending on the  dose.  
Study LTS13632 
This ongoing phase 2,  a multinational,  multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, long-term study, was 
designed to  assess the ongoing safety and efficacy of olipudase alfa in patients  with  acid 
sphingomyelinase deficiency who already participated in studies with  olipudase alfa. Patients previously 
treated in studies DFI13412  and DFI13803  were to  enrol. Patients started this  study at the same dose 
they were receiving at the  end of their original study, provided that  they had not missed more than  1 
biweekly dose before the  entry into  this study. It was confirmed that  all patients from the previous 
studies, except one, rolled over without  tre atment interruption.   
Comparative  study for paediatric data 
The efficacy data from BL to week 52  was compared to the  data collected in the prospective NHC  study 
MSC12840,  which included 30 paediatric patients. The comparison analysis selected  paediatric patients 
in DFI13803  Peds with  age at screening ≥5. In comparing efficacy parameters at Week 52/Year 1 
between DFI13803 Peds and MSC12840, the  imbalance in age at  baseline between the two studies was 
considered so that the age at baseline was one of the  covariates in the analyses of covariance model 
(ANCOVA). Further,  the applicant showed that  the imbalance in age at baseline on the observed 
efficacy parameters did not affect the overall interpretation of the results; for 3 out  of 4  measures, age  
had no effect. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose finding studies 
Both dose-finding studies (DFI13412  and SPHING0605)  showed that under olipudase alfa treatment for 
the PD parameters ceramide, an increase in plasma levels was observed indicative for the MoA  of 
olipudase alfa in ASMD patients. In the multiple dose study (under continued treatment) the ceramide 
post-infusion levels decreased over time which is considered indicative for the  remova l of accumulated 
sphingomyelin from the tissues; this  was confirmed by liver biopsies.  
Data on spleen and liver volume in study  DFI13412 showed a decrease from baseline to week 26 ; In 
study DFI13412,  spleen volume reduced by 29%,  which is considered clinically meaningful, liver 
volume reduced 22%  from baseline. Given the limited number of patients (n=5),  no firm conclusions 
can be drawn. For 2/5  patients, the reductions from baseline in liver volume were low, likely because 
they had near-normal liver volumes at baseline (MN=1).  These two  patients may have a less severe 
disease burden.  
It is observed that after 26 weeks of olipudase alfa treatment, the results for the lung function 
parameters were stable or improved very slightly.  Given the limited number of patients, no firm 
conclusions can be drawn, and the study duration of 26 weeks could be too short to improve DLco. One 
out of 5 patients  showed an improvement >15%  from baseline in DLco, the  generally accepted 
minimum for a conclusion of a treatment effect in  the most common restrictive pulmonary disease IPF 
(see above). The small improvements of FVC % predicted (1.5%  (6.5)),  TLC % predicted (3.9% 
(7.7)), FEV1 % predicted (0.6%  (4.9))  could be within  the range of variation of the test at least for 
FEV1. Only one patient  switched from the category moderate to mild.

DFI12712 
A total of 36 adult patients  were randomised in this  placebo -controlled study; given the rarity of the 
disease, this number is considered acceptable. Seventeen out of 18 patients  randomised to  olipudase 
alfa were treated according to the protocol. Generally, both groups were well balanced with  respect to 
the baseline characteristics. The 18 patients in the  treatment group had a mean a ge (SD) of 21.4 
(20.3)  years, and 18  patients in the placebo groups had a mean age (SD) of 14.6 (16.1)  years) when 
first diagnosed. A detailed analysis was submitted showing  no statistically  significant effect for age at 
ASMD for % change in % predicted DLco (p-value=0.81). A borderline statistically  significant for age at 
ASMD diagnosis was shown for %  change in spleen volume (p-value=0.052).  However, there was no 
statistically significant  age at ASMD diagnosis-by-treatment interaction (p-value=0.52).  
This indicates that  a difference in age at ASMD diagnosis unlikely  had major impact on olipudase alfa 
treatment effect.  
Further, there is a slight disbalance for gender; in the placebo group, more females than males were 
included. This is not a problem as the population pharmacokinetic analysis did not  show a difference in 
olipudase alfa exposure between male and female patients.  
The mean % predicted DLco at  baseline was similar in both  groups (48.5%  in the placebo group and 
49.4%  in the olipudase alfa group) and reflected an overall moderate impairment of diffusion capacity. 
At baseline 7 patients  (4 placebo; 3 treatment  had a DLco <40% of predicted. This is considered 
having severe lung disease.  There were no patients with  oxygen therapy at baseline in th e olipudase 
alfa clinical development program. A total  of ten patients had history of oxygen use (7 patients)  and/or 
had a temporary use of oxygen during the study (3 patients).  As there is no mentioning of oxygen 
therapy at  the end of the  study, it is assumed that  no patient became dependent of oxygen. 
Outcomes 
DLCO 
The first primary endpoint for improvement of % predicted DLCo (change from BL to week 52)  was 
met. Using MMRM  during PAP in the mITT population, the LS mean percentage change in %  predicted 
DLco from baseline to  Week 52 was greater in the olipudase alfa group (22%) compared to  the placebo 
group (3%), a difference of 19% (p=0.0004).  At week 104 (end of ETP), when patients previous on 
placebo crossed to olipudase alfa, the  LS mean in percentage change from baseline in % predicted 
DLco improved by 25%  and 22%  in the placebo/olipudase alfa group (n=10)  and the olipudase 
alfa/olipudase alfa group (n=17),  respectively, using the original baseline. The results are consistent 
with  the results of the PAP. Sensitivity and supportive results showed similar results.  
There were 5 DLco responders (change from baseline on % predicted DLCO  ≥15%  at Week 52)  in the 
olipudase alfa group and none in the  placebo group. At Week 104, a post hoc analysis showed that 
8/15  in the placebo/ olipudase alfa group and 7/15 patients  in the olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group 
were responders. This is indicative that more patients achieve the goal of a ≥15%  improvement from 
BL under continued treatment. Beyond week 104,  DLco seems to remain stable; however, no firm 
conclusions can be drawn given the  limited number of patients.  Nevertheless, improvement or 
stabilisation of DLco is considered a beneficial effect. 
As the long-term follow-up of the pivotal study is ongoing, not all patients (6 out  of 36)  have reached 
the end of week 104 at  data cut-off.  Between week 156  and week 208, 11  out of 36 patients received 
treatment. Four  patients received olipudase alfa for more than 208  weeks. The final study report is 
awaited in due time. 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 101/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The decline in DLco observed at Week 184 in the  olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group is explained by 1 
patient who  missed 6 consecutive infusions from Week 174 to  Week 184.  This patient  lives in a COVID-
19 hotspot,  and was considered to  a be high-risk patient due to severe pulmonary manifestations of 
ASMD. In addition,  it can also be observed that whe n treatment  is ceased, the lung function  capacity 
rapidly declines but restores after treatment is reinitiated. However, b ased on the data of 12 patients, 
sporadic treatment interruptions  of olipudase alfa do not  have a major impact on the efficacy of 
olipudase alfa. As expected, lyso-sphingomyelin, a PD biomarker, increased but did not have clinical 
consequences with  respect to DLco, spleen and liver volume, and platelets.   It is agreed that no 
specific wording on temporary ceasing treatment and deterioration of disease symptoms in  the SmPC 
is required. 
Spleen volume 
The second primary endpoint of reduction of spleen volume (change from BL to  week 52) was met as 
well. The LS mean percentage change showed a reduction in the olipudase alfa group (39%)  compared 
to an increase in the placebo group (0.  5%). At Week 104,  the LS mean percentage change in spleen 
volume from baseline in the placebo/olipudase alfa group patients  (n=11)  was reduced by 35.9%  and 
by 47.0% in the  olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group (n=14).   
The prespecified responder analysis - a ≥30%  reduction from baseline in  spleen volume at 52  weeks – 
showed that in  the treatment group, 17/18  patients were responders. In contrast, there were no 
responders in the placebo group. In line with  the improvement of the spleen, improvement in platelet 
counts is seen, which is also beneficial.  
Liver Volume 
In the PAP, a reduction from baseline to week 52 of 28%  in liver volume was observed in the treated 
group compared to placebo. An early clinical relevant response was already observed at week 26 .  The 
results from the  PAP were sustained in the long-term follow-up.  A similar reduction in liver volume was 
observed in patients switched from placebo to olipudase alfa. In general, normalisation of liver volume 
can be considered beneficial in patients with  a lysosomal storage disease.  
Further evidence of efficacy is supported by liver biopsies showing sphingomyelin reduction after 52 
weeks of treatment. Similar results were shown when placebo patients  crossed over to olipudase alfa 
in the ETP. The biopsy results are in  line with the  results of liver volume reduction. The change from 
baseline for liver function  tests (e.g. ALT, AST, bilirubin)  and lipid  profiles (LDL, HDL)  also showed 
consistent improvements indicative of liver function  improvement. In the placebo group, the liver 
function did  only change marginally.  
Quality of life and dyspnoea 
In literature (e.g., Jones et al., 2020),  DLco is described as predictive for mortality and morbidity, 
which may hold true for other diseases, but whether this  also applies to ASMD is unknown. Low DLco 
seems to be associated with  low QoL scores. The literature mentions that  most ASMD patients report 
dyspnoea and recurrent respiratory infections (Cox et al., 2018).  It is anticipated that  under olipudase 
alfa treatment, dyspnoea will either resolve or at least show some improvement.    
The data show that in both  the treated and placebo gro ups the  improvement for the  FACIT-dyspnoea 
score is similar. 
In addition, in the  Patient global impression of change scale (PGIC), there is an item on the shortness 
of breath. Only for this item a difference between the 2 groups was observed. Patients in the  olipudase 
alfa group (n=17)  reported greater improvement (LS mean = 1.11)  than the placebo group (n  = 16, 
LS mean =  0.30). For the  shortness of breath item, the responder rate in  the  olipudase alfa group was 
higher than in the  placebo group (61%  versus 28%). The treatment groups were not  different from 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 102/136 
 
 
 
 
other PGIC items at Week 52.  Similar trends were observed on the PGIC items during the long term 
follow-up when placebo patients  crossed over to olipudase alfa treatment. The observations made for 
dyspnoea and shortness of breath can be explained the fact that  dyspnoea is a subjective symptom, 
per the  European Respiratory Society (Laviolette et al., 2014),  and can be confounded by changes in 
other emotional symptoms such as high anxiety/depression. Patients can adapt their behaviour to high 
anxiety/depression. A patient’s  perception of his/her illness can influence  dyspnoea; those with higher 
neuroticism and lower conscientiousness were more likely to  have dyspnoea, regardless of COPD 
status (Terracciano et al., 2017).  These observations particularly apply to the ASMD patient population 
in DFI12712  ASCEND. The majority of these patients have been living with  ASMD for many years (age 
at diagnosis and age at baseline trial  entry). Therefore, they may have adapted their lifestyles to 
become more sedentary. Hence, such measures in a patient population that  has learned to adapt to 
their disease burden may be less relevant. Measurement of QoL parameters can thus  be challenging in 
adult ASMD patients. Nevertheless, the  observation that in the  treated group patients  showed a 
greater improvement over placebo adds to the  overall beneficial effects of olipudase alfa treatment. 
Data of the  prospective NHC study MSC12804  shows a difference in baseline value for D Lco for 
dyspnoeic on non-dyspnoeic patients.  Subgroup analyses showed that the  treatment effect in  the 
patients being dyspnoeic or non-dyspnoeic at baseline was similar. This was also observed when 
accounting for baseline ILD severity.  
Other lung function  tests 
In line with  the observed improvement in DLco, the  other pulmonary tests (FVC, FEV 1 and TLC) -
tertiary endpoints - showed relevant improvements in the PAP. In the ETP, these results were 
sustained. Results were confirmed when  the patients crossed over from placebo to  olipudase alfa, and 
these improvements were also sustained. It should be noted that  the measurements of FEV 1, FVC are 
measurements that  could be influenced by the  muscle strength.   
The applicant also investigated the lungs by , amongst others, high-resolution CT scans, showing 
improvements from baseline. 
These differences in the pulmonary tests are reflected in the  treadmill test, another tertiary endpoint 
(see below). 
Ergometry 
A post-hoc analysis on treadmill ergometry (CPET) was also performed. Overall the results indicate a 
difference between olipudase alfa and placebo patients in favour of olipudase alfa (change from 
baseline to week 52). After placebo patients crossed over to olipudase alfa, all parameters improved in 
the placebo/olipudase alfa group. This may also be indicative of some improvement in lung function. 
Notably, baseline O2 saturation in both groups was in the normal ranges  with  no difference between 
the two  groups (~97%).  The values stated in the line listing  for ergometry (O 2 saturation, etc.)  are 
measured when the patient  is at rest. The applicant confirmed that data on exercise values are not 
available.  
In summary, the lung function  data, including DLco, and the reduced reporting of shortness of breath 
indicates improvement of lung function  in ASMD patients.   
Other efficacy data 
Several tertiary endpoints were evaluated amongst other liver function tests  (e.g. ALT, AST, bilirubin). 
The liver function test  showed consistent improvements in line with  the improvements of the liver 
(reduction of liver volume). A similar trend was observed for the lipid profile, which showed 
improvements in the treated group but not  in the placebo arm.

Paediatric study DFI13803 
The efficacy results (e.g., reduction of spleen and liver volume, improvement of DLco  (3  out of 4 
adolescents and 6 out of 9 children showed improvements in D Lco), improvement of platelet counts, 
improvement of liver-related enzymes and lipid  profiles) observed in paediatrics are in  line with  the 
efficacy results observed in adults  (e.g. pivotal study).  The data is indicative of improvement. Given 
the limited  number of patients (n=20)  and the uncontrolled, open-label nature of the study, no firm 
conclusions can be drawn. 
In contrast to the adult  data, an improvement on different QoL measures is observed in paediatric 
patients. The primary objective of the study was to assess safety, therefore, no clear con clusions 
regarding the efficacy of the product in the  paediatric population can be drawn.  
The paediatric data was compared to data from a prospective NHC  study (see further below) showing 
improvement in spleen and liver volume, but  the results for DLco did not show any large differences. It 
may be that  disease progression is yet not too  advanced in these paediatric patients, and thus more 
time is required to show an effect on DLco.  
As in the pivotal study, ergometry (cycle) was also performed in some pati ents  (3 adolescents; 2 
children). In the 5 patients who  performed the test,  a trend towards improvement on cycle ergometry 
was observed; however, given the limited  number of patients and the lack of control arm, no firm 
conclusion can be drawn. Additional submitted  data on the  percent predicted oxygen uptake 
(parameter to measure an individual’s capacity to perform aerobic exercise, but is dependent of the 
effort) showed that  in 4 of 5 patients  in DFI13803 Peds this improved after 52 weeks of olipudase alfa  
treatment. This indicates a functional improvement in  paediatric ASMD patients. Notably, all patients 
showed simultaneous improvement in one or more of the following lung  function parameters: % 
predicted DLco, % predicted FEV 1, % predicted FVC and/or % predicted TLC. Although the numbers 
are limited,  the data are indicative of improved lung  function under continued olipudase alfa treatment.   
In addition, the quality  of life among paediatric patients in  DFI13803 Peds was measured using the 
PedsQL™ Generic Core Scales questionnaire. One of the  four scales in  this questionnaire is Physical 
Functioning,  which  includes questions that  measure how difficult  certain activities of daily living 
(walking, running,  play sports or exercise, etc.) are for the patient either from the patient’s or parent’s 
perspective. In addition to the trend toward improvement on ergometry measures, 4 out  of 5 patients 
had an increase on their  self-reported physical functioning  scale score of the PedsQL™ assessment, 
while for three out  of five patients, an increase in the parent-reported physical functioning  scale score 
was observed. 
Therefore, despite the  limited number of patients  under continued  olipudase alfa treatment  there is a 
trend in improvement in  QoL besides the observed efficac y parameters on DLco, spleen and liver. 
The paediatric patient's  growth (height Z -score) and bone markers (BAP) were also investigated. Under 
continued olipudase alfa treatment,  these children gained growth (height  Z -score improved). The mean 
overall increase was 0.56  at Week 52,  and 0.78  at the end of the study at Week 64.  Improvements in 
height Z scores were generally similar across all age groups. Improvement in growth also reflects upon 
the child’s general health  status, which thus  is supportive of clin ical benefit.  
BAP is correlated with  bone growth  in children. At BL, the BAP mean values are below the normal 
values for healthy peers. The mean BAP increased from baseline to Week 52 in all age groups except 
for the adolescent cohort. This increase may be due to treatment, but  it cannot be excluded that  it is 
also attributed  to the  growing child. The reduction of BAP in  adolescence is also a normal observation.  
Comparative study for paediatric data 
The comparison between paediatric populations in both  MSC12840, a natural history study, and 
DFI13803  Peds showed a relevant decrease in spleen volume (46%), liver volume (48%),  and platelet

count (46%),  HRCT (both GG and ILD), and height  Z score, consiste nt with  the results of study 
DFI12712.  However, for % predicted DLco, in the MSC12840  group, the standard deviation of 
percentage change (50.9) is much higher than that  in DFI13803  Peds group (29.1).  The applicant 
explained that  at the time of the comparison of data from both  studies, the same formula was used for 
the calculation of the % predicted DLco (i.e., %  predicted values from MSC12840 had to be 
recalculated for that purpose), potential differences in data collection may have occurred that  could 
explain differences in SD. The applicant suggests that  this difference in data collection may be 
attributed  to the difference in study design. Study MSC12840  was a prospective, multicenter, 
multinational  natural history study in patients with  Niemann-Pick type B disease of varying severity, 
while study DFI13803  Peds study was a Phase 1/2, multi-center,  open-label, ascending dose study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory efficacy of 
olipudase alfa in paediatric patients. Although there is a difference in collection, a standardised 
execution of lung function  measurements would not impact the  results of a test. Therefore, it is more 
likely that  the recalculation would explain the large difference in SD for the %  change from BL. 
Although the  large SD indicates a less precise measurement of baseline DLco, it can be accepted for 
the comparisons of the studies.  
Long term follow-up study LTS13632 
In line with  the results observed in the preceding studies, the improve ments in spleen and liver volume 
were maintained in the  LTFU  (up to the cut  off 1 March 2021).  DLco further improved; however one 
adolescent patient  deteriorated after 18 months of treatment. Based on additional submitted  data 
which pertained to a single female patient who had anaemia, it  is considered possible that  due to a 
combination of anaemia (likely due to the onset of puberty with  menorrhagia) and normalization of 
height,  as demonstrated by the Height  Z Score improvement, the % predicted DLco adjuste d for 
haemoglobin decreased in this patient.  For the other efficacy parameters, no deterioration was 
observed. Although the data are very limited, further improvement in ergometry values from baseline 
was observed.  
For the 5 adults  original started in study DF13412,  78  weeks data is available. For the paediatric 
patients initially  started in study DFI13803,  about 62 weeks of data is available.  
The clinical relevance of the PedsQL Generic Core Scales and the PedsQL Multidimensional  Fatigue 
Scale was further substantiated.  
The positive changes from baseline to  Week 52 were compared to  MCID estimates derived from the 
published literature and the DFI13803 Peds dataset. The published MCID thresholds are based on 
child- and parent-reported PedQL Generic Core data from 10,241  families in the United States. The 
MCID threshold was calculated in that  sample as 1 standard error of measurement (SEM)  to reflect the 
amount of improvement required to exceed changes that  may occur due to measurement error alone. 
Published thresholds for the Multidimensional  Fatigue  Scales are not available. Additionally, the 
distributions  of the  baseline PedsQL scores in the  DFI13803Peds study were examined to estimate an 
MCID; 0.5 standard deviation of the baseline values for all scales wa s used as the  MCID estimate. 
Based on these MCIDs the number of responders was scored. For example, for the domain fatigue 
score when self-reporting 92% of the patients was considered responders above the MCID.   
For both measures, it  was shown  that the size effects are considered relevant. Given the limited 
number of patients  available (n=13) no firm conclusion can be drawn, however, it  is noted that for 
most of the score items, a positive effect is observed. This is indicative of additional beneficial effe cts 
noted by the patients and/or caregivers.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It is considered demonstrated that under continued olipudase alfa treatment, spleen and liver volume  
are reduced. These reductions are clinically meaningful. It is also considered demonstrated that  DLco 
improves or stabilises under continued treatment. The observed improvements of DLco are also 
considered clinically relevant. Results in adults and paediatrics are comparable, and the extrapolation 
of adult data to paediatrics is sufficiently substantiated  and justified. In addition to the observed 
improvements in organomegaly, improvements in pharmacodynamic parameters, other lung function 
parameters, improvement of dyspnoea and improvement in Qo L were noted.  
The indication in type A/B and B ASMD patients  is acceptable. As the  youngest patients  were 
diagnosed around birth and some patients  treated in the first months of life, no age restriction has to 
be included in the indication. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient  exposure 
Seventy-two (72)  patients divided over 5 studies (some of the patients  participated in more than 1 
study) received olipudase alfa. Of them,  11 received a single dose and are not  included in the pooled 
safety database. Of the  remaining 61 patients,  there are 41 adults and 20 children. Follow  up varied 
from 26  weeks up to 9 years.

For patients from DFI13412  and DFI13803  Peds, the number of patients completed study treatment refers to the 
study treatment during LTS13632  study.  
Treated patients only referred as patients who are treated with olipudase alfa.  
Of the 59 patients,  55 (20 paediatric patients and 35/39  adults) achieved a dose of 3.0 mg/kg at the 
time of the data cut-off.

Four adult  patients were not  receiving the 3.0 mg/kg dose at the  data cut-off.  Two patients had not 
reached the 3.0 mg/kg dose due to  TEAEs. Two patients  (placebo/olipudase alfa in DFI12712  ASCEND) 
had not reached the 3.0  mg/kg dose due to  reasons other than  TEAEs. In one patient,  the data cut-off 
occurred before dose escalation in the ETP was completed, and the other patient  had missed doses.

2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
The most reported TEAEs in adults were: headache (n=26,  65.0%),  nausea (n=17,  42.5%), 
nasopharyngitis (n=17,  42.5%),  upper respiratory tract infection (n=16,  40.0%), back pain and 
abdominal pain (n=14  each, 35.0%), and arthralgia (n=13,  32.5%). In children the  most reported AE 
were: pyrexia (n=18,  90.0%),  cough (n=16, 80.0%),  nasopharyngitis (n=14, 70.0%),  diarrhoea, 
vomiting, and headache (n=13  each, 65.0%). 
For the most frequently reported TEAEs, a higher proportion of paediatric than  adult patients 
experienced TEAEs potentially reflecting the common cold (e.g., nasopharyngitis, cough, upper 
respiratory tract infection). Paediatric patients were also more likely to report pyrexia, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, and abdominal pain.  
Most  adverse events can be related to infusion  reactions (high temperature, rash and erythema like 
cutaneous manifestations) or treatment  failure . 
An overview of TEAEs is provided in Table 24. 
All 60 patients (100.0%)  had at least one TEAE; 43 (71.7%)  patients had treatment related TEAEs; 
14 (23.3%)  patients had at least 1 severe TEAE; and 11  (18.3%)  had a TEAE leading to dose 
reduction. No patient  permanently discontinued treatment.   
When compared with  placebo, no clear pattern of AE’s could be identified related to the study drug.

The percentage of patients  with  treatment-related TEAEs was similar in adult and paediatric patients 
(69.2%  and 70.0%, respectively). 
Treatment-related AEs were experienced by 43  (71.7%) of all patients (N=60),  and the  percentage of 
patients with  treatment-related TEAEs was similar in adult  and paediatric patients (70.0%  [28/40]  and 
75.0%  [15/20],  respectively). 
Headache (31.7%),  Pyrexia (25.0%),  Nausea (20.0%),  Abdominal pain (15.0%),  Vomiting  (16.7%), 
Myalgia (11.7%),  Pruritus (10.0%),  Urticaria (21.7%),  and C-reactive protein increased (10.0%)  were 
the treatment related adverse events most reported.  
2.6.8.3.  Deaths 
As of the data cut-off  date (15  March 2021 for DFI12712 ASCEND , and 01 March 2021  for LTS13632), 
no deaths were reported. 
2.6.8.4.  Serious adverse  event 
There were 22 (36.7%)  patients who had 43 treatment-emergent SAEs. The treatment-emergent SAEs 
were most frequently in the SOC infections and infestations  (7 patients, 11.7%).   
Most  frequently reported serious adverse events considered infections in  7 patients (3 adults and 4 
children). In the adults, the infections are considered COVID, urinary tract infection and 1 case of 
gastritis. In the children, 2 cases of gastritis and one of pharyngitis are reported ; further, one case of 
pneumonia was reported. In addition, three SAE were reported more than once: one event of loss of 
consciousness each in 2  adult patients; one event of gastroenteritis each in 2 paediatric patients;  and 
2 events of hypersensitivity in 1 paediatric patient. 
The percentage of patients  with  SAEs was higher in paediatric than  adult patients (45.0%  versus 
32.5%,  respectively), as were related SAEs (20.0%  versus 2.5%) and severe TEAEs (35.0%  versus 
17.5%).   
The higher incidence of SAEs, dose reductions and severe TEAEs in paediatric patient s, compared to 
adults, did not  impact the paediatric populations  attaining maintenance -level dosing with  olipudase 
alfa.  
When compared with  placebo no SAE could be identified to be related to the  study drug.  
2.6.8.5.  Laboratory findings 
2.6.8.5.1.  Haematology 
Sporadic fluctuations  were observed in mean changes from baseline for haematology parameters in 
adult and paediatric patients. In general, fluctuations  were transient and observed at later timepoints 
when the number of patients in the analyses was reduced.  
2.6.8.5.2.  Clinical chemistry 
Overall, among those patients with  normal lab values for chemistry values at baselin e, the most 
frequently observed divergent values during treatment were high  creatinine in 20  (33.3%)  patients, 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 109/136 
 
 
 
 
 
hypoglycaemia in 18 (30.0%)  patients and elevated BUN in 14  (23.3%) patients. 
For adults, the  most frequently observed divergent values during treatment  were glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L 
and <LLN  in 15 (38.5%)  and glucose unfasted ≥11.1 mmol/L  and fasted >7 mmol/L  in 7 (17.5%) 
patients. 
For children the most frequently observed divergent values during treatment were BUN  ≥6.4 mmol/L or 
18 mg/dL  reported in 14 (70.0%)  patients and potassium ≤3.5 mmol/L in 3 (15.0%)  patients. 
In general, the fluctuations  observed were transient. 
2.6.8.5.3.  Liver function and coagulation 
Overall, there was a decrease in the numbers of adult  and paediatric patients with  elevated LFT 
(alkaline phosphate, ALT, AST, direct bilirubin,  total bilirubin)  values , indicating  improved liver 
function.  The transaminase elevations were particularly observed in patients with  liver function tests 
>2xULN  at baseline and during the dose-escalation phase and are likely associated with  the initially 
increased breakdown of accumulated sphingomyelin stored in  the liver. Transaminase el evations were 
no longer or less likely observed during the  dose maintenance period. In patients with  liver function 
tests <2xULN  post infusion elevations in AST or ALT were observed in a few patients.   
There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in coagulation parameters in adult or 
paediatric patients.   
2.6.8.5.4.  Urinalysis 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in  urine pH. 
2.6.8.5.5.  Vital  signs 
Overall, there were no meaningful changes in mean vital sign parameters. However changes in  vital 
signs were more often reported in children. 
2.6.8.5.6.  Electrocardiogram 
According to the  newly updated ICH E14  guideline, a prolongation of QTc > 500 ms during therapy is a 
threshold of particular concern in clinical trials. However, as none of the adult  patients had an increase 
≥500 ms in QTc and none of the following clinical events indicative for a QT prolongation were 
reported: Torsade de Pointes, sudden death,  ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fib rillation and 
flutter,  it can be assumed that olipudase alfa treatment  does not induce a clinically relevant QT 
prolongation.  
2.6.8.6.  Treatment  discontinuation 
According to the  applicant, none of the AEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation  during the first 
104 weeks of treatment.   
Temporary treatment interruption was mostly due to  adverse events related to IAR (infusion 
associated reactions). Other adverse events leading to temporary treatment  interruption are 
considered chance findings  (COVID-19 and pneumothorax) or related to the underlying disease 
(tonsillitis,  upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and conjunctivitis).  
Dose reduction was mainly due to treatment-related pyrexia, liver function  disturbances or vomiting. 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 110/136 
 
 
 
 
2.6.8.7.  Infusion-associated reactions  
IARs occurred in 53.8%  of adult patients. The most frequent IARs were headache, nausea, urticaria, 
pyrexia, and arthralgia. All IARs were mild  or moderate , and headache was the most frequently 
reported moderate IAR. More adult  patients had IARs during dose escalation than after.  
IARs occurred in 60.0%  of paediatric patients. The most frequent IARs were pyrexia, urticaria, 
vomiting, headache, nausea, C-reactive protein increased, serum ferritin increased, and rash. Three 
paediatric patients  had a serious IAR, anaphylactic reaction (n=1),  urticaria and rash (n=1), and 
hypersensitivity reactions (n=1), respectively. The percentage of paediatric patients with  IARs was 
similar during and after dose escalation.  
Overall, 15 (25.4%)  patients had 61  hypersensitivity related IARs, including  7 (17.9%)  adult patients 
and 8 (40.0%)  paediatric patients.  The more than 2-fold higher proportion of paediatric patients 
suggests that  children with  ASMD may have a higher risk of hypersensitivity IARs ass ociated with 
olipudase alfa treatment. 
2.6.8.7.1.  TEAEs by place of infusion (site or home) in Study LTS13632  
Of the 24 patients  in Study LTS13632 who had data collected by the CSR cut-off date 
(10 December 2019), 14  patients (5 adult  and 9 paediatric) had home infusions. No TEAEs during the 
home infusion period were serious, resulted in  treatment interruption, di scontinuation,  or dose 
reduction.  
2.6.8.7.2.  TEAEs and infusion-associated reaction analyses  by the  manufacturing process 
There was no consistent association of TEAEs with  either process in either group, which  suggests that 
exposure to olipudase alfa from either process  did not impact the  safety profile of olipudase  alfa. 
2.6.8.7.3.  TEAEs by ADA status 
These are discussed under the secondary pharmacology par agraph above. 
2.6.8.7.4.  ADA-positivity and ADA association with hypersensitivity IARS 
In the olipudase alfa safety set, hypersensitivity IARs were reported more frequently in ADA positive 
patients compared to ADA negative patients respectively, both in adults,  5 (38.5%)  versus 2 (7.7%) 
patients and in paediatric patients 7 (58.3%)  versus 1 (12.5%)  patients . 
Comparing patients  who developed ADA with those who did not,  respectively, treatment-emergent 
SAEs were reported in 4 (30.8%)  versus 5 (19.2%)  adult patients  and in  6 (50.0%)  versus 3 (37.5%) 
paediatric patients.  For adults, each of the  SAE PTs represented a singular event, and no patterns 
could be identified. In paediatric patients, 3  of 6 ADA positive patients with  SAEs had hypersensitivity 
IARs. 
In either adults or paediatric patients, rash, pruritis, and urticaria were the only hypersensitivity IARs 
reported in more than one ADA positive patient. 
2.6.8.7.5.  Pre-treatment 
Pretreatments for prophylactic management of IARs were not to  be used systematically. In  patients 
who experienced moderate to severe or recurrent IARs with  evidence of hypersensitivity,  pretreatment 
regimens (eg, antihistamines, antipyretics, glucocorticoids) could be prescribed by  the Investigator as 
per clinical judgment.

2.6.8.8.  TEAE and IAR analyses  by manufacturing process  
The applicant provided data on subject disposition  and exposure across manufacturing process.  
2.6.8.9.  TEAEs by process 
By-process results for both adult and paediatric patients appear not very different.  Safety in special 
populations. 
2.6.8.9.1.  Gender 
No trends were observed between male and female patients  for the most frequently reported types of 
TEAEs. 
2.6.8.9.2.  Age 
A higher proportion of infants/early children patients experiencing SAEs, compared to the other 2 age 
cohorts, and a lower proportion of adolescent patients experiencing IARs, compared to the other 2 age 
cohorts, no trends among age cohorts were  observed for the most frequently reported types of TEAEs. 
2.6.8.9.3.  Race 
No trends were observed between racial or ethnic groups for the most frequently reported types of 
TEAEs. The limited  number of patients  in certain racial or ethnic  groups makes comparisons bet ween 
groups difficult to interpret. 
2.6.8.10.  Safety  related  to drug-drug interactions and other interactions  
See PD assessment. 
2.6.8.11.  Post marketing experience 
At the time of the data cut-off dates, olipudase alfa is not marketed in  any country. Expanded access 
safety experience prior to the  data cut-off  dates is described below. 
One paediatric patient  received olipudase alfa as part of an eIND application to prepare planned gene 
therapy. The patient  experienced 2 anaphylactic reactions; treatment was discontinued given the much 
lower anticipated benefit of gene therapy following  the delay of its start and the patient’s  overall 
condition. 
As of the cut-off  dates, 7  patients (6 paediatric and 1  adult patient)  have been enrolled in  the 
individual compassionate use programs, and 3 patients (1 paediatric and 2  adult patients) were 
enrolled in the  temporary authorization for use program. Of the 10 patients,  one paediatric patient 
from the  US had an SAE. This patient (aged 12 months) also had several events of emesis during 
infusion and an overnight stay following the  infusion, which was part of the patient’s baseline medical 
history. The patient had a feeding tube , and the treating  physician did not  think the  frequency or 
severity of the emesis had changed compared to baseline.

2.6.8.12.  COVID-19 
The COVID-19 pandemic did not  appear to have an impact on the adverse events (and efficacy; see 
ancillary assessment) observed in both adult  and paediatric patients.   
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The olipudase alfa safety data from 4 clinical studies with  multiple-dose regimens were pooled to form 
the olipudase alfa safety set. The 4 clinical studies include Phase 1b (DFI13412),  Phase 1/2 
(DFI13803  Peds), Phase 2/3  (DFI12712 ASCEND), and long term (LTS13632)  studies. The Phase 1a 
clinical trial (SPHINGO00605)  was not  included in the pool because it is a single -dose study. As the 
safety information retrieved from the single-dose studies is limited, it  is considered acceptable not to 
include this information in the  safety database. Two (2)  studies (DFI13412, DFI13803  Peds) are 
completed. The data cut-off dates for the 2 ongoing studies DFI12712  ASCEND and LTS13632 are 
15 March 2021  and 01 March 2021,  respectively. 
The safety database consists of 61 patients.  Eleven (11) received a single dose and are not included in 
the pooled safety. Of the 61 patients  included, there are 41 adults and 20 children. Of them, 57 (20 
children and 37 adult patients)  are still under treatment. Follow  up varied from 26  weeks up to 9 
years. 
Three patients  discontinued during the DFI12712  ASCEND ETP (all adults).  Two patients  in the 
olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group (one withdrew  consent and the second per patient's decision) the 
other patient in the  placebo/ olipudase alfa group discontinued for reasons related to the COVID -19 
pandemic. According to the applicant, there were no discontinuations  due to AE by the cut-off  date. 
The low number of patients  makes the pooled database limited  and will  not  allow for robust 
conclusions, especially for the rarer adverse events. Although it  is accepted that  the limited database is 
the only information that can be used in  the assessment, the applicant  updated the safety information 
during the procedure. Further,  it is considered that  a more complete safety profile will emerge during 
treatment over the years following routine pharmacovigilance. 
The majority of TEAEs in  the overall safety set were mild or moderate in severity. Fourteen (23.3%) 
patients had 22 severe TEAEs; loss of consciousness was reported in 2 patients,  and all other severe 
TEAEs were single events occurring in individual patients. As in the pre-clinical study, bradycardia was 
reported it  should be ruled out that  the loss of consciousness was due to cardiac conduction 
dysfunction (for discussion hereof, see below). 
Treatment-related TEAEs were experienced by 43  (71.7%) of all patients (N=60),  and the  percentage 
of patients with  treatment-related TEAEs was similar in adult and paediatric patients (70.0%  and 
75.0%,  respectively). Headache (31.7%),  pyrexia (25.0%), urticaria (21.7%),  nausea (20.0%), 
vomiting (16.7%),  abdominal pain (15.0%), myalgia (11.7%),  pruritus (10.0%),  and c-reactive 
protein increased (10.0%)  were the treatment related adverse ev ents most reported. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were reported by a higher proportion of paediatric than adult 
patients. TEAEs reflect the common cold (e.g., nasopharyngitis, cough, upper respiratory tract 
infection), infusion reactions (high temperature, rash and erythema like cutaneous manifestations) or 
failure of treatment.  Nevertheless, in paediatric population  the most frequently reported TEAEs were: 
pyrexia (n = 18, 90%),  cough (n = 16, 80%),  nasopharyngitis (n = 14, 70%),  diarrh oea, vomiting, 
and headache (n = 13 each, 65%). No  specific pre -treatment to mitigate  the occurrence of pyrexia 
was stated. Antipyretics with  paracetamol, being the  most common antipyretic used, were the most 
frequently reported medications to  treat the patients (16  patients received paracetamol, 1 patient 
received metamizole and paracetamol, 1 patient received paracetamol and salicylic acid). All events 
Assessment report

except one were resolved. Therefore, it is agreed with  the applicant that  based on the data, no specific 
recommendation for pre-treatment is required. Routine symptom management and antipyretic therapy 
should be applied if needed. 
The applicant was requested to discuss whether there were differences in the safety profile between 
responders and non-responders (responder was a patient meeting the ≥15% improvement in DLco 
from BL).  A comparable incidence of severe TEAEs was reported between both responders and non -
responders. More moderate events were reported in the responder group compared to non -responders.  
In 30.4% of patients  from the responder group and 35.3% from the non-responder group, serious 
adverse events were reported. No relation between severity of disease at baseline and TEAEs reported 
was observed.  
Diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are signs and sympto ms of the disease (especially in 
children) and might be indicative of treatment  failure rather than a treatment-related AE.  
There were 22 (36.7%)  patients who reported 43  SAEs. Most  reports of serious adverse events 
considered infections (3 adults and 4 children). In the adults,  the infections were COVID, urinary tract 
infection and 1 case of gastritis. In the children 2 cases of gastritis,1 of pharyngitis and 1 case of  
pneumonia were reported. Three SAEs were reported more than once: one event of loss of 
consciousness each in 2  adult patients; one event of gastroenteritis each in 2 paediatric patients;  and 
2 events of hypersensitivity in 1 paediatric patient. 
The percentage of patients  with  SAEs was higher in paediatric than  adult patients (45.0%  versus 
32.5%,  respectively), as were related SAEs (20.0%  versus 2.5%) and severe TEAEs (35.0%  versus 
17.5%).   
A higher proportion of paediatric patients  experienced treatment-emergent ADA compared to adult 
patients. In both  groups, hypersensitivity -related IARs occurred in a higher proportion of patients  who 
developed treatment emergent ADA than  those who did not. 
The majority of the serious and severe eve nts pertained to  the SOC “Infections and infestations”. 
However, no specific pattern was observed regarding the nature of these events in  the paediatric 
population compared to the  adult population as most of the  events were isolated. The reported events 
do also not  suggest that any of them  were more often reported as severe or serious in children out of 
special concerns for that  population. All patients recovered from all events cited above.    
The effects of ADA and the relation to anaphylactic reactions, h ypersensitivity reactions and IAR are 
depicted in the SmPC. 
To date, no death occurred (cut off 15 March 2021). 
Compared with  placebo, no clear pattern of AE’s related to the study  drug could be identified.  
ASMD patients  are known for a high frequency of r ecurrent respiratory infections (42%  of patients 
presented with  a history of pulmonary infections and shortness of breath). Therefore a high frequency 
of respiratory infections is to  be expected. However, the high frequency of infections (about 90%) 
reported appears higher than reported in the literature. This observation might reflect the different 
objectives and approach to data collection between clinical studies and natural  history studies. The QoL 
results did not indicate that  infections have a relevant detrimental influence on the QoL in children. 
Further, the  infections did not result in aggravations of the underlying conditions. 
Temporary treatment interruption was mostly due to  IAR related adverse events. Other adverse events  
leading to temporary treatment interruption  are considered chance findings (COVID -19 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 114/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pneumothorax) or related to  the underlying disease (tonsillitis,  upper respiratory tract infection, 
nasopharyngitis, conjunctivitis). Dose reduction was mainly due to pyrexia, liver function   disturbances 
or vomiting. 
Overall 29 (48.3%)  patients developed treatment-emergent ADA. ADA titers were predominantly low, 
5 patients,  3 paediatric and 2 adults developed intermediate titers up to 3200.  Some of the TEAEs 
associated with  ADA also resemble IARs. Among all 61 patients, 1  (1.7%) paediatric patient had an 
anaphylactic reaction, the remaining IARs were assessed as mild  (30 patients, 50.0%,  302 events) or 
moderate events (17 patients, 28.3%,  51 events). The most frequently reported IARs were urti caria (8 
patients, 13.3%)  and headache (6 patients,  10.0%). Mild  and moderate IARs were manageable. Based 
on the evaluations during  the clinical trials, the immunogenicity profile of olipudase alfa has been 
adequately characterized, and the development of ADA does not  pose a clinical risk in the majority of 
patients. Based on the  clinical data, no impact of ADAs was observed; from a safety perspective, ADA’s 
did not influence the observed TEAEs. The TEAEs associated with  treatment-emergent ADA 
(anaphylactic reaction, urticaria) resulted in temporary discontinuations of treatment in 2  patients. A 
higher incidence of treatment-emergent infusion-associated reactions (IARs) and hypersensitivity was 
seen in  patients who developed treatment-emergent ADA versus those who did not.  There was no 
general pattern suggesting  a relationship to ADA status.  ADA results are not used in the clinical 
management of patients  having symptoms of IAR and hypersensitivity. Therefore, it is agreed with  the 
applicant for all the  reasons stated, routine ADA measurement does not  provide additional clinical 
benefit and is not warranted post-authorization. For the moment, these patients  will be treated in 
specialised centra. It is assumed that  antibodies will  be measured in those patients  r eporting 
immunogenetic related reactions. Therefore currently, no risk minimalization measures are deemed  
necessary.  
There was a higher percentage of patients  with treatment-emergent hypersensitivity-related IARs in 
patients who developed treatment-emergent ADA versus those who did not; a similar trend was also 
seen for IARs. The high frequency of IARs is of concern. The Applicant clarified the risk factors for the 
occurrence of infusion-related reactions. Overall, the most frequently reported IARs in the  overall 
safety population  were headache, nausea, pyrexia, urticaria, arthralgia, vomiting  and abdominal pain. 
The most frequently reported IARs in paediatric patients  were pyrexia, urticaria and vomiting.  
12 patients  meeting the high IAR group criterion were identified and 48 patients  who reported less 
than 10  IAR events. In the paediatric population 4 and 16 patient  who reported the high  and low  IAR 
were identified.  It was shown that in the  paediatric population, the  high IAR group was younger (mean 
age 5.9  years) compared to the low IAR group (mean age 8.8 years).  
With  respect to the disease characteristics, mean age at ASMD diagnosis appeared to be lower in the 
high IAR group than  in the low IAR group.  
Overall, it cannot  be excluded that  age at  diagnosis may be associated with  a higher incidence of IARs.  
With  respect to the effectiveness of pre-treatment, no adult patient  in study DFI12712 received any 
pre-treatment during the primary analysis period. 
The analysis of the data in paediatric patients  in study DFI13803 showed that  about 10% of the 
infusions were associated with  a medication to pre -treat or treat an IAR. 4  paediatric patients with  pre-
treatment were associated with  70 of the 102 IARs. In contrast, the remaining 7 paediatric patients 
who reported a total  of 32  IARs did not receive any pre -treatment. Overall, the number of paediatric 
patients associated with  pre-treatment was low. It is agreed with  the applicant that  the limited data do 
not support a general recommendation in the  SmPC to administer pre-treatments for prophylactic 
management of IARs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 115/136 
 
 
 
 
Besides the patients that  reported anaphylaxis in the  clinical studies,  1 paediatric patient -reported two 
anaphylactic reactions in the named-patient programme. The occurrence of anaphylaxis and 
desensitisation steps are reflected in the  SmPC. Further pre-treatments for prophylactic management 
of IARs were not  to be used systematically but  could be prescribed by the Investigator as per clinical 
judgment. No analysis of the  use of pretre atment was provided. The applicant elaborated that  no 
specific pre-treatment to mitigate  the occurrence of pyrexia was stated. Routine symptom 
management and antipyretic therapy should be applied if needed. 
The reported loss of consciousness, syncope or pr esyncope were either isolated or widely separated in 
time. There was no evidence of QTc prolongation: no female patient  had a QTcB or QTcF >470  ms and  
no male patient  had a QTcB or QTcF >450  ms during the study. Further,  the following clinical events 
indicative for a QT prolongation were not reported: Torsade de Pointes, sudden death, ventricular 
tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and flutter.  Based on the totality  of these data, it can be assumed 
that  olipudase alfa treatment does not  induce clinical relevant QT prolongation.  
Analysis of liver parameters identified no clear pattern of adverse events. As treatment  is considered to 
improve liver parameters, this  is not  a surprise. However, some transaminase elevations were 
observed during the dose-escalation phase in patients  with  liver function tests  >2xULN at  baseline.  
According to the  applicant, this might  be related to the initially  increased breakdown of accumulated 
sphingomyelin stored in the  liver. Transaminase elevations were no longer or less likely observed 
during the dose maintenance period.  
Analysis of haematology identified no clear pattern of adverse events . The frequency of AEs related to 
thrombocyte function indicates that  under treatment  the number of reported haemorrhage TEAEs  are 
decreasing. This, however, was not reflected in  the changes in function  coagulation parameters 
(Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (sec), D-Dimer (mg/l),  Prothrombin Intl.  Normalized Ratio 
(RATIO), Prothrombin Time (sec)) in adult  or paediatric patients nor in the improvement of the 
platelets (about 25%  of the  adults with  normal platelet count  at the start have a platelet count  below 
normal after 1 year of treatment).  Further  analysis of the patients for whom haemorrhagic events 
were reported did not show abnormal platelet counts  at the time of the event. It should also be noted 
that  over 85% of the adverse events were reported as a bruise o r contusion, and this was more 
commonly observed in paediatric patients  than in adult  patients, the improvement regarding 
haemorrhagic events may therefore not  only be related to the platelet count and the  coagulation 
parameters. The age distribution  might be the confounding factor as adults  are less prone to have 
bruises or contusions. 
Experience with  treatment in compassionate use programs did not reveal new or unexpected (S)AEs.  
Although the  duration of exposure in the at-home infusion setting  was shorter than  that of the at-site 
infusion setting,  the fact that  the proportion of patients  with TEAEs in the  at-home infusion  setting is 
lower still indicates no increase of TEAEs after switching to  at-home infusions. 
The number of TEAE and IARs across manufacturing processes was considered comparable.

2.6.1.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The adverse events profile is generally mild to moderate and is, in most cases, manageable. The 
majority of reported adverse events are related to infections, infusion-related reactions or gastro-
intestinal  complaints (disease signs and symptoms in children). 
For the most frequently reported AEs, a higher proportion of paediatric than  adult patients experienced 
AEs. 
To date, no deaths occurred (cut  off 15 March 2021). 
There was no evidence of QTc prolongation: no female patient had a QTcB or QTcF >470  ms , and no 
male patient  had a QTcB or QTcF >450  ms during the study.  
The proportion of patients  with TEAEs in the at-home infusion setting  is lower, indicating  no greater 
increase of TEAEs after switching  to at-home infusions. 
The number of TEAE and IARs across manufacturing process was considered comparable.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with  target patient  groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that  the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in  the  Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request of translation exemption of the  labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC  has been 
submitted  by the applicant requesting to have English only for the outer carton together with  the 
immediate labelling and the  package leaflet in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway. This request 
has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the  following reasons : 
Xenpozyme is indicated for the treatment of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD) in paediatric 
and adult patients.  This is an orphan medicinal product. The main rationale for this  request is the 
currently very small number of patients  in need of treatment in  the Nordic countries.  
The treatment with  Xenpozyme should only be initiated and supervised by a healthcare professional 
experienced in the  management of ASMD. Local language versions of the  package leaflet and SmPC; 
as well as local language versions of RMP stipulated risk minimisation materials (Healthcare 
professionals guide, Patient guide and Patient card) will  also be available via the  QR code/URL 
displayed on the outer packaging and the package leaflet for all EU country packs.  
The labelling subject to  translation exemption as per the  QRD Group decision above will ho wever be 
translated in all languages in the  Annexes published with  the EPAR on EMA website, but  the printed 
materials will  only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group . 
2.9.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and package leaflet for the purpose of providing 
information to Healthcare Professionals, patients and caregivers  has been submitted by the applicant 
and has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code:  
Statutory information  
• Approved regulatory information, including the  patient information leaflet (PIL) and Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC); 
• Educational material as outlined  in the Risk Manageme nt Plan (healthcare professionals guide and 
patient card);  
• Access to the national reporting systems for adverse events websites;  
• Contact numbers of the local representative of the MAH;

2.9.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU)  726/2004,  Xenpozyme (olipudase alfa) is included in 
the additional monitoring  list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.   
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that  this will  allow quick identifi cation  of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Olipudase is being developed for the  treatment of non-CNS manifestations of ASMD, a rare and 
potentially life-threatening hereditary lysosomal storage disorder that can affect vital organs 
(e.g., lung, liver, CNS) and which results from the  insufficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase ASM, 
caused by various mutations in  the smpd1 gene. The overall estimated incidence is 0.4  to 0.6 in 
100,000  live births,  and although ASMD is rare, this may  be an underestimate of the true incidence 
due to under-or misdiagnosis. 
Patients are presenting with  a broad spectrum of disease manifestations, ranging from a rapidly 
progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease course in patients  with  primary CNS involvement 
(ASMD type A) to more chronic manifestations with  variable degrees of visceral organ and CNS 
involvement (ASMD types B and A/B). In patients  with  ASMD type B or type A/B, the  disease burden, 
both with  respect to  morbidity and mortality, is primarily driven by the  degree of impairment of lung 
and liver function  and complications due to excessive enlargement of organs, with  respiratory 
complications, liver failure and bleeding events being key drivers of early mortality , development 
delays and failure to  thrive prominent in children. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is no disease-specific treatment that can modify the disease or slow the rate of progression. 
Patients can only be provided palliative and supportive care for managing symptomology. 
Complications of the  disease, such as progressive respiratory impairment and recurrent respiratory 
infections, liver cirrhosis, or splenomegaly with  increased risk of splenic rupture,  may mandate 
invasive therapeutic interventions that by themselves are associated with  substantial  risks (e .g., total 
lung lavage, liver transplantation, splenectomy). 
Several attempts have been made to use cellular and solid organ transplantation  as an indirect source 
of ASM replacement therapy. However, these interventions are also associated with  substantial risks , 
and the experience to date with  cell and organ transplantation  is very limited . 
Therefore, corrective treatment for ASMD remains an unmet medical need.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence to support the benefit-risk assessment for olipudase alfa is derived from 
three clinical trials in patients with  ASMD: 
•  DFI12712  ASCEND, a randomized placebo-controlled pivotal trial in 36 adult  patients with  ASMD 
type B and type A/B, generated placebo-controlled data on the effects of olipudase alfa on 
pulmonary function  and spleen size and several other parameters of organ impairment due to 
ASMD, as well as the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa. The initial 52-week primary analysis 
period of this  study included a dose escalation phase followed by maintenance therapy of olipudase 
alfa at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks IV, or matching placebo. Thereafter, all patients were switched  over 
to an ongoing ETP with  open-label olipudase alfa for an additional 52  weeks. After week 104, 
patients could further receive olipudase alfa treatment  in the long-term follow-up part of this 
pivotal study. 
•  DFI13803  Peds, a single-arm study in 20  paediatric patients (4  adolescents, 9 children, 7 
infants/early child),  is the major study to support the paediatric indication. This 64 -week study 
deployed a similar olipudase alfa dosing regimen as DFI12712  ASCEND. While the main focus was 
on safety and pharmacokinetics, efficacy endpoints similar to  those in DFI12712 ASCEND were 
assessed as well.  
•  An additional long-term follow-up study, LTS13632  addressed the safety and persistence of 
efficacy over a longer duration of olipudase alfa treatment at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks IV in 
paediatric patients  enrolled from DFI13803 Peds and 5 adult  patients study DFI13412.   
Overall, 5 clinical trials with  olipudase alfa included a total  of 67 patients with  ASMD (47 adults, 
20 paediatric patients). Three clinical trials (SPHINGO00605  (an early single -dose Ph1a study), 
DFI13412,  and DFI13803 Peds) were completed, and 2 clinical trials (DFI12712  ASCEND and 
LTS13632)  are currently ongoing.  These clinical trials are complemented by two completed non -
interventional natural history studies (NHC),  MSC12840,  a prospective, cross-sectional, natural history 
survey in 59 patients  (29 adults, 30 paediatric patients) with  ASMD, and SPHINGO00302, a 
retrospective natural history study of 100  patients (49  pre-pubertal) with  ASMD. The two  NHC studies 
(MSC12840  and SPHINGO00302) are used to compare the clinical data observed in the paediatric 
patients in  study DFI13803. Further,  the NHC  studies will be helpful to inform on the disease course in 
ASMD patients. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pharmacodynamic 
In the pivotal study, in adults (DFI12712;  n=36),  for the  most important PD parameters (change from 
BL to week 52)  the LS mean difference (SE) placebo (n=18)  vs olipudase alfa (n=18) were for the % 
change in chitotriosidase (nmol/mL/h)  -42.4  (10.1); % change in plasma lyso-sphingomyelin (lyso-
SPM) (ug/L)  -72.7 (5.8);  and % change in  plasma ceramide (mg/L) -36.1  (7.8).  All changes between 
placebo and olipudase alfa were statistically  significantly different. When placebo patients were crossed 
over at week 52  to olipudase alfa treatment similar reductions were observed. The reductions that 
were reached were maintained up to week 238,  although patient  numbers were limited.  In the 
paediatric open-label single-arm study (DFI13803)  similar results (change from baseline to week 52) 
for the PD parameters were seen. 
Percentage predicted DLco 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 123/136 
 
 
 
 
 
The LS mean % change from BL to week 52 in % predicted DLco (95%  confidence interval (CI)) was 
3.0 (-4.0,  10.0)  and 22.0  (15.2,  28.8), for placebo and olipudase alfa respectively (p=0.0004).  The 
primary endpoint was met. 
A prespecified responder analysis for DLco in  adults showed that  5/18  treated patients met the 
criterion of ≥15%  change from BL to week 52,  while none of the  placebo patients was a responder. 
After cross-over (week 52 to  104) in the placebo/olipudase alfa group, 8/15 patients were responders 
and 7/15 in  the olipudase alfa/olipudase alfa group.  
Reduction of spleen volume 
The LS mean % change (BL to week 52)  in spleen volume (CI) was 0.5 (-4.6,  5.6) and -39.5  (-44.3,  -
34.5),  for placebo and olipudase alfa respectively (difference -39.9 (-47.1,  -32.8),  p<0.0001).  This 
second primary endpoint  was met.   
Reduction of liver volume 
The LS mean % change (BL to week 52)  in liver volume (CI) was -1.5 (-6.6,  3.7) and -28.0  (-33.1,  -
23.0),  for placebo and olipudase alfa respectively (p<0.0001). 
Platelet count 
The LS mean % change (BL to week 52)  in platelet count (CI) was 2.5 (-6.0,  11.0) and 16.8  (8.8, 
24.0),  for placebo and olipudase alfa respectively (p<0.0001). 
The results on DLco, spleen and liver volume, and platelet count observed in the pivotal study are 
repeated for the patients crossing over from placebo to olipudase alfa receiving 52  weeks of olipudase 
alfa treatment (week 52 to  week 104). For the  overall paediatric group (n=20),  reductions similar to 
those observed in adults were seen.  
Other pulmonary tests 
In line with  the observed improvement in DLco, the  other pulmonary tests (FVC, FEV 1 and TLC) -
tertiary - showed relevant improvements in the PAP. In the ETP these results were sustained . The data 
on the key pulmonary imaging parameters (change from baseline to  week 52) in adults  treated with 
olipudase alfa in study DFI12712  and DFI13803 suggest improvements in the lungs.  Similar results 
were observed in paediatrics. 
Quality of life  
The Patient global impression of change scale (PGIC) in adults showed a difference for the item on the 
shortness of breath. Patients in the  olipudase alfa group (n=17)  reported greater improvement (LS 
mean =  1.11) than  the placebo group (n = 16, LS mean = 0.30).  In addition, for the  shortness of 
breath item, the responder rate in the olipudase alfa group was higher than  in the placebo group (61% 
versus 28%). 
PedsQL Generic Core Scale and Multidimensional  Fatigue  Scale showed some improvements on the 
majority of subtests at Week 52 compared to baseline. The PedsQL Multidimensional  Fatigue  Scale 
showed positive changes at Week 52, in the  overall group compared to baseline in 3 of 4 subtests in 
both child and parent reports. In addition,  the Week 52 mean positive change from baseline on the 
Cognitive subscale showed improvements on the child reports, but  not on the parent-reports (highest 
baseline mean). 
Ergometry 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 124/136 
 
 
 
 
The applicant conducted a post-hoc analysis on treadmill ergometry (CPET), which indicated a 
difference between olipudase alfa treated and placebo-treated patients  in favour of olipudase alfa. 
When patients from placebo crossed over to olipudase alfa, results were repeated. 
Cycle ergometry was performed in some paediatric patients  (3 adolescents; 2 children). In the 5 
patients who performed the test,  a trend toward improvement on cycle ergometry was observed in the 
following parameters: mean maximum workload (+31.2  Watts overall at Week 52), mean percent 
predicted Maximum Workload (+3.4% absolute change overall at Week 52), mean working time (+2.8 
min overall at Week 52),  mean maximum O 2 Uptake (+691.8  mL/min overall at Week 52),  and mean 
maximum CO2 Output  (+561.2  mL/min overall at Week 52). 
Additional efficacy endpoints in paediatrics 
Additional efficacy parameters were evaluated in paediatrics, e.g. height Z-score, one age (by hand X-
Ray. The changes from baseline to week 52 showed improvement suggestive for growth catchup.   
Further, paediatric data collected over 52  weeks in the prospective NHC  study (MSC1284b0)  was 
compared to the efficacy data – collected over 52 weeks – in paediatric patients from study  DFI13803. 
It is noticed that  the paediatric patients  treated with olipudase alfa showed significant improvements in 
most efficacy parameters compared, including reduced spleen volume (mean difference 46.26%), 
reduced liver volume (48.22%),  and increased platelet count (45.78%),  and increased height z-score 
(0.64). 
Long term follow-up study LTS13632 
For the clinical parameters (reduction of spleen volume, percentage predicted DLco, reduction of liver 
volume and platelet count),  the improvements reached during the preceding studies DFI13803 and 
DFI113412  were maintained up to month  60. In the different paediatric age cohorts, improvements 
were similar. When comparing the  5 adults with  the overall paediatric group (n=20)  improvements 
were similar as well.  
Ergometry 
By Month  54,  the mean (SD) workload increased by 12.4  (31.9)  Watts (range, -22 to 61)  for the 5 
adult patients.  By Month  30, the  mean (SD) workload increased by 87  (34) for 3 paediatric patients 
(range, 61 to 125),  while the percent predicted workload improved by 10.7%,  (SD= 21.8,  range, -7% 
to 35%). 
In both groups, further improvements in mean O2 uptake and CO2 output  were seen. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A total of 67 patients with  ASMD (47 adults, 20  paediatric patients)  were included in the studies; this 
number is limited. All patients were either ASMD type B, or ASMD type A/B. No patients with  ASMD 
type A were included in the studies. ASMD type A patients are excluded from the indication,  given that 
olipudase alfa does not  cross the BBB, and the severe neurological problem s cannot be treated. 
Nine out  of 60  patients developed neutralising antibodies (NAbs) that inhibited  catalytic activity.   
Pivotal study DFI12712 (adults  only)  
One patient in the placebo group did not  complete the  PAP  due to poor compliance; therefore in the 
ETP 35 of 36 patients remained in  the study. As the  long-term follow-up of the pivotal study is 
ongoing, not all patients  (29 out of 35 patients)  have reached the end of week 104 at the  data cut -off. 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 125/136 
 
 
 
 
Between week 156 and week 208,  11 out of 35 patients  received treatment. Four patients received 
olipudase alfa for more than 208 weeks. 
The LS mean change (SE) for the FACIT Dyspnoea symptom score from baseline to Week 52  was not 
different between the olipudase alfa and placebo groups; -5.9  (1.7) versus -6.8  (1.9),  respectively. 
There were no differences observed for the other PGIC items except for dyspnoea at Week 52.  Similar 
trends were observed on the PGIC items during the long term follow-up when placebo patients crossed 
over to olipudase alfa treatment.  
The results for the other QoL questionnaires about  dyspnoea showed contrasting results.  
Paediatric study DFI13803 
The paediatric study was an open-label study without  a control arm in  20 patients. The primary 
objective of the study was to assess safety.  
DLco is not  measured in infants. 
Long term follow-up study LTS13632 
Only a limited  number of patients were included in the long term follow-up; 5 adults  patients from 
study DFI13413  and 20  paediatric patients  from DFI13803. 
During the LTF,  further improvements in ergometry values from baseline were observed. However, 
data is available from 5 paediatric patients, which  is too limited  to draw firm conclusions.   
In paediatric patients  up to month 30,  improvements in the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue  Scale 
were observed (self- and caregiver reported). Beyond month 30, no relevant improvements were seen. 
The clinical relevance of the the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue  Scale is unknown.  
Comparative study for paediatric data 
The efficacy data from BL to week 52  was compared to the  data collected in the prospective NHC  study 
MSC12840,  which included 30 paediatric patients. The data from 4  paediatric patients and 
10 adolescent patients in the MSC12840  study were compared with  data from 11 paediatric patients 
and 4 adolescent patients  in DFI13803. At  BL there was a disbalance in age.  
No difference in DLco % predicted at  baseline was observed in the  two cohorts (MSC12840,  ~52; 
DFI13803,  ~54). The applicant mentioned that  in the % change from BL for DLco the large difference 
in SD (study  MSC12840 was 50.9  and in  DFI13803 this  was 29.1)  might  be explained by the 
differences in study design.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The olipudase alfa safety data from 4 clinical studies (Phase 1b (DFI13412),  Phase 1/2 (DFI13803), 
Phase 2/3  (DFI12712), and long-term study LTS13632)  with  multiple-dose regimens were pooled to 
form the  olipudase alfa safety set. The Phase 1a clinical trial (SPHINGO00605) was not included in  the 
safety pool.  
The safety database consists of 61 patients.  Eleven (11) received a single dose and are not included in 
the pooled safety. Of the 61 patients  included, there are 41 adults and 20 children. Of them, 57 (20 
children and 37 adult patients)  are ongoing in clinical studies. 
Three patients  discontinued during the DFI12712  ETP (all adults).   
Follow-up  varied from 26 weeks up  to 9 years.

The majority of TEAEs in  the overall safety set were mild or moderate in severity. Fourteen (23.3%) 
patients had 22 severe TEAEs; severe loss of consciousness was reported in 2  patients, and all other 
severe TEAEs were single events occurring in individual patients.   
Most  frequently reported common AE for the overall population were: headache (65.0%), 
nasopharyngitis (51.7%),  pyrexia (50.0%),  cough (46.7),  upper respiratory tract infection (45.0%), 
nausea (43.3%),  abdominal pain (41.7%),  diarrhoea (40.0%), arthralgia (33.3%),  abdominal pain 
upper (31.7%),  back pain (31.7%),  oropharyngeal pain (30.0%)  and vomiting (30.0%). 
Treatment-related TEAEs were experienced by 43  (71.7%) of all patients (N=60),  and the  percentage 
of patients with  treatment-related TEAEs was similar in adult and paediatric patients (70.0%  and 
75.0%,  respectively). Headache, pyrexia, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, myalgia, 
pruritus, and C-reactive protein increased were the treatment-related adverse events most reported. 
For the most frequently reported TEAEs, a higher proportion of paediatric than  adult patients 
experienced TEAEs potentially reflecting the common cold (e.g., nasopharyngitis, cough, upper 
respiratory tract infection). Paediatric patients were also more likely to report pyrexia, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, and abdominal pain.  
Most  adverse events can be related to infusion  reactions (high temperature, rash and erythema like 
cutaneous manifestations) or treatment  failure .  
There were 22 (36.7%)  patients who reported 43  SAEs. Most  reports of serious adverse events 
considered infections in 7 patients  (3 adults and 4 children). Three SAE were reported more than  once: 
1 event of loss of consciousness each in 2 adult  patients; 1 event of gastroenteritis each in 2 paediatric 
patients; and 2 events of hypersensitivity in 1 paedia tric patient. 
The percentage of patients  with  SAEs was higher in paediatric than  adult patients (45.0%  versus 
32.5%,  respectively), as were related SAEs (20.0%  versus 2.5%) and severe TEAEs (35.0%  versus 
17.5%).   
To date, no death occurred (cut off 15 March 2021). 
None of the AEs led to  a permanent treatment discontinuation.  Temporary treatment interruption was 
mostly due to IAR related adverse events. Other adverse events leading to temporary treatment 
interruption are considered chance findings (COVID-19 and pneumothorax) or related to the underlying 
disease (tonsillitis,  upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and conjunctivitis).  Dose 
reductions were mainly due to pyrexia, liver function disturbances or vomiting. 
Overall, 29 (48.3%)  patients developed treatment-emergent ADA. ADA titers were predominantly low. 
Some of the TEAEs associated with  ADA also resemble IARs. Among all 61  patients, 1 paediatric 
patient had an anaphylactic reaction; the remaining IARs were assessed as mild (30 patients,  50.0%, 
302 events) or moderate events (17 patients,  28.3%,  51 events). The most frequently reported IARs 
were urticaria (8 patients,  13.3%) and headache (6 patients,  10.0%).  From the named-patient 
program, another patient was reported with  an anaphylactic r eaction. 
The reported loss of consciousness, syncope or presyncope were either isolated or widely separated in 
time. There was no evidence of QTc prolongation: no female patient  had a QTcB or QTcF >470  ms , and 
no male patient  had a QTcB or QTcF >450  ms during the study.  
Analysis of liver function  identified no clear pattern of adverse events.  However, some transaminase 
elevations were observed during the dose -escalation phase in patients with  liver function  tests >2xULN 
at baseline. Transaminase elevations were no longer or less likely observed during the dose 
maintenance period.

Analysis of haematology identified no clear pattern of adverse events . The frequency of haemorrhage 
TEAEs is decreasing. The changes in function coagulation parameters (Activated Partial Thromboplastin 
Time (sec), D-Dimer (mg/l),  Prothrombin Intl.  Normalized Ratio (RATIO), Prothrombin Time (sec)) in 
adult or paediatric patients  did not change nor did the  platelet count; about 25%  of the  adults with 
normal platelet  count at the start  have a platelet  count below normal after 1 year of treatment. 
Experience with  treatment in compassionate use programs did not reveal new or unexpected (S)AEs. 
The proportion of patients  with TEAEs in the at-home infusion setting  is lower compared to in-clinic 
infusions. 
The number of TEAE and IARs across manufacturing processes is considered comparable.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The low number of patients  makes the pooled database limited  and will  not allow for robust 
conclusions, especially for the rarer adverse events. Further, it  is considered that a more complete 
safety profile will emerge during treatment over the   years.  
ASMD patients  are known for a high frequency of recurrent respiratory infections (42%  of patients 
presented with  a history of pulmonary infections and shortness of breath).  Although a high frequency 
of respiratory infections is to  be expected, the   reported frequency of infections (about  90%) is high 
when compared to the literature.  
Besides the patients in  the various studies reporting anaphylaxis , also in the name-patient  programme 
1 paediatric patient reported anaphylactic reactions (twice).  The occurrence of anaphylaxis is reflected 
in the SmPC. Among the patients  with  anaphylaxis, 1 patient was desensitized. The desensitisation 
procedure for this  patient required several steps, which were detailed by the applicant. 
The frequency of haemorrhage TEAEs is decreasing during treatment.  The changes in function 
coagulation parameters (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (sec), D -Dimer (mg/l), Prothrombin 
Intl. Normalized Ratio (RATIO), Prothrombin Time (sec)), however, did not  change nor  did the platelet 
count (about  25% of the adults with  normal platelet  count at start have a platelet count  below normal 
after 1 year of treatment)  these apparent contradictive results are not discussed or analysed.  
Although the  duration of exposure in the a t-home infusion setting  was shorter than  that of the at-site 
infusion setting,  the fact that  the proportion of patients  with TEAEs in the  at-home infusion  setting is 
lower might indicate no greater increase of TEAEs after switching  to at-home infusions.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is no disease-specific treatment that can modify the disease or slow the rate of progression in 
ASMD. Therefore, there is a high  unmet medical need. Only 67 ASMD pa tients  with  type A/B and B 
were included in the  clinical program. Given that  ASMD is an orphan disease, this is accept able. 
The indication is restricted to the treatment of ASMD type A/B an B patients,  which is agreed. The 
youngest patients were diagnosed around birth  and some patients treated in the first months  of life, 
hence no age restriction has to  be included in the  indication. Alth ough olipudase alfa – as shown by the 
QSP model – can also be used to  treat organomegaly in ASMD type A patients,  it does not  cross the 
BBB, and thus  no large beneficial effects in  survival for these type A patients  are to be expected.  
Plasma ceramide, a major catabolite of olipudase alfa-mediated metabolism of sphingomyelin, 
increased transiently following each olipudase alfa infusion in  both adult and paediatric patients, 
signifying olipudase alfa bioactivity. A consistent  decrease of mean plasma ceramide along with  plasma 
Lyso-SPM, and other PD markers (chitotriosidase, CCL18,  and ACE) was observed with  olipudase alfa 
treatment over time. These reductions are consistent with  the debulking of sphingomyelin from tissues 
which are evidenced by liver biopsies and add to the  pro of of concept.  
In line with  the observed reductions in PD parameters, under continued  olipudase alfa treatment  it was 
demonstrated that DLco % predicted improved, and spleen and liver volume decreased. Improvement  
in DLco % predicted (≥15%  improvement from BL), and the reduction of spleen volume (≥30% 
reduction from BL) were both considered primary endpoints; both  endpoints were met and the 
differences are clinically relevant and meaningful. At data cut-off, not all patients (only 29/35  patients) 
treated in the pivotal study reached week 104,  i.e.. the end of the  ETP phase. One patient from the 
placebo group discontinued the PAP due to  poor compliance, leaving 35 patients in the  clinical 
program. Beyond week 156,  data from 11/35  patients is available. There fore, no firm conclusion on the 
long-term efficacy can be drawn; however, there is at least a positive trend which is reassuring that 
the treatment effect of olipudase alfa is maintained long term. Efficacy results in adults and paediatrics 
were similar. Despite the  absence of a control arm and the limited  number of paediatric patients, the 
PD and efficacy data is indicative of improvement; moreover, based on the literature and the natural 
history studies, no spontaneous improvement is observed in ASMD pati ents. 
These positive results on PD parameters, organomegaly and lung function  do not seem to have a large 
effect on the  reported dyspnoea in these adult patients;  the improvement is similar in  both the treated 
and placebo groups. This observation might be explained by the fact that  the majority of these patients 
have been living with ASMD for several years (age at diagnosis and age at baseline trial entry). 
Therefore, they may have adapted their lifestyles to become more sedentary. In paediatric patients, 
QoL and fatigue score results were more pronounced. Subgroup analyses based on the dyspnoea 
status at  BL and baseline ILD severity showed no difference in treatment effect.   
In both adults and paediatric patients under continued treatment, improvement in O2  capacity 
(measured by ergometry) was observed, which indicates an increase in workload capacity. 
Improvements in ergometry were maintained long-term; the number of patients is limited. 
Safety 
The low number of patients,  which is acceptable for such a rare  disease, limits  the safety database and 
will not  allow for robust conclusions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 131/136 
 
 
 
 
Based on the evaluations during  the clinical trials, the immunogenicity profile of olipudase alfa has 
been adequately characterized and the development of ADA does not pose a c linical risk in  the majority 
of patients. Based on the clinical data no impact of ADAs was observed, from a safety perspective 
ADA’s did not have an influence on the observed TEAEs. The TEAEs associated with  treatment 
emergent ADA (anaphylactic reaction, urticaria) resulted in temporary discontinuations  of treatment  in 
2 patients.  A higher incidence of treatment  emergent infusion-associated reactions (IARs) and 
hypersensitivity was seen in  patients who developed treatment emergent ADA versus those who did 
not. There was no general pattern  suggesting a relationship to  ADA status. ADA results are not used in 
the clinical management of patients  having symptoms of IAR and hypersensitivity. Therefore, the 
routine measurement of ADA’s is not required. A high perce ntage of anaphylaxis was reported with  one 
patient following  a successful desensitizing procedure. This desensitisation consisted of multiple 
specific steps. Given that desensitisation steps are specific, and remotely occurred, it is mentioned in 
the SmPC to  contact the MAH  in case of hypersensitivity. This is agreed. 
The reported loss of consciousness, syncope or presyncope were either isolated or widely separated in 
time. There was no evidence of QTc prolongation. Further,  the following clinical events in dicative of a 
QT prolongation were not reported: Torsade de Pointes, sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, 
ventricular fibrillation,  and flutter. Based on the totality  of these data , it  can be assumed that olipudase 
alfa treatment does not induce clinical relevant QT prolongation.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The indication in ASMD type A/B and B patients  is acceptable. Although the limited  database precludes 
robust conclusions on all outcomes , the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that  under continued 
treatment with  olipudase alfa, improvement of DLco and reduction of spleen and liver volume were 
obtained. The improvements and reductions are considered clinically relevant. Additional  observations 
in improvements of other lung parameters, pharmacodynamic endpoints, and QoL contribute  to the 
totality  of clinical evidence. The adverse events profile is generally mild to moderate and manageable 
in most cases. Most  reported adverse events are related to infections, inf usion-related reactions or 
gastrointestinal complaints (disease signs and symptoms in children).   
The benefit/risk for olipudase alfa is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The Applicant is applying for a full standard marketing authorisation conform Article 8.3 of Directive 
2001/83/EC.  By restricting  the indication to ASMD type A/B and B patients, and based on the criteria  
below, it can be concluded that  the clinical data submitted  by the applicant is  considered 
comprehensive. Therefore, Xenpozyme can be granted a full  MAA  conform Article 8.3  of Directive 
2001/83/EC. 
Regulatory options (e.g. criteria) for approval (standard marketing  authorisation, 
conditional marketing  authorisation, authorisation under exceptional  circumstances ).  
1. 
Quality of evidence (including feasibility considerations) 
From an internal validity perspective, one placebo -controlled study has been conducted in 36 
patients comparing olipudase alfa to placebo (52 weeks of placebo or olipudase alfa followed by 
OLE of 52 weeks and LTF).  Furthermore, a smaller single -arm paediatric study  (n=20) and a 
dose-finding study in 5 adult  patients, and an ongoing long-term extension study (includes the 
20 paediatrics and 5  adults) were submitted.  Safety information was availab le for 61 patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/571472/2022  
Page 132/136 
 
 
 
 
Given the rarity of the disease, this is considered reasonable. Therefore, it can be concluded 
that  the “Quality of evidence” is as good as can be expected. 
2. 
Efficacy: precision of effect size 
Both the primary endpoints, e.g. change from baseline to week 52 for DLco % predicted, and 
spleen volume were met in a randomised placebo-controlled study in adult  ASMD patients  with 
type A/B or type B. Results were confirmed when patients previously on placebo were switched 
to active treatment. Similar results were also shown for paediatric patients  who were treated in 
an open-label clinical study for 52 weeks.  
3. 
Efficacy: clinical meaningfulness of the  endpoint 
The primary endpoint on DLco %  predicted (e.g. ≥15%  improvement from BL to week 52) is 
considered clinically relevant and sufficiently substantiated. This is also applicable to the 
reduction in spleen volume (≥30% reduction from BL t week 52).   In addition, liver volume, PD 
parameters and other lung  function parameters also pointed  in the same  direction for 
improvement. Moreover, spontaneous improvement of disease symptoms has not been 
reported in the  literature or was observed in natural history studies.  
4. 
Efficacy: duration of efficacy 
Under continued olipudase alfa treatment further improvements in both  adult and paediatric 
patients were observed.  
5. 
Safety: exposure 
Safety information was available for 61 patients,  with  72% exposed for more than one year. 
Given the rarity of the disease, this is considered reasonable. Of interest is the  lower frequency 
of anaphylactic, hypersensitivity, and infusion-related reactions. 
6. 
Safety: length  of follow-up 
Safety information was available for 61 patients.  The mean follow-up is 3.6  years.  
7. 
Target population vs. study population 
The target population is all ASMD patients  with type A/B or type B from birth.  Type A/B and B 
were those patients  included in the clinical program. Type A ASMD patients  are not included in 
the labelling, as due to the severe neurological issues, life expectations are very  limited; the 
applicant excluded the patients  from the indication. 
8. 
Pharmacological rationale 
Olipudase alfa is an ERT intended to replace the faulty enzyme. Hence there is a strong 
pharmacological rationale. 
9. 
Natural history/ course of the disease 
Several natural history studies and case report series consistently demonstrate that  ASMD is 
associated with  significant pulmonary morbidity and mortality. The median life expectancy for 
the chronic visceral end of the ASMD spectrum (e.g. type B) has been reported as 17 years 
with  a range of 1 to 72 years.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Xenpozyme is positive, subject to the conditions  stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of Xenpozyme is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Xenpozyme is indicated as an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non -Central Nervous 
System (CNS) manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD) in paediatric and adult 
patients with  type A/B or type B. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

physician. 
•  Contact information of the prescribing/treating physician/centre that  can be reached at any 
time. 
•  Reminder to the  women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) to discuss the  need for 
contraceptive measures with  the prescribing/treating physician. 
•  Reminder to the  WOCBP to contact their prescribing/treating physician if they suspect they 
might  be pregnant or plan pregnancy 
New  Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP  review of the  available data, the CHMP considers that  olipudase alfa is to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not  a constituent  of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within  the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the  available paediatric data of studies  subject to  the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0459/2020  and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

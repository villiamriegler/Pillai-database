1.3.  Introduction 
This application concerns a generic medicinal product referring to the centrally authorised product Vimpat, 
which was first approved in the European Union on 29 August 2008. 
The active substance is lacosamide, an amino acid derivate with anticonvulsive activity. Although its 
mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, lacosamide has shown to selectively enhance slow 
inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyper-excitable neuronal 
membranes.  
Vimpat was first approved as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalization in patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older. An extension of 
indication from add-on treatment to monotherapy was approved on 10 November 2016. At the time of this 
report, Vimpat was indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adult and adolescent (16-18 years) patients with 
epilepsy. 
Vimpat is available as tablets (50mg, 100mg, 150mg, and 200mg), solution for infusion (10mg/mL), and 
syrup (10mg/mL). Treatment is initiated at a starting dose of 50 mg twice a day which is titrated in weekly 
increments to a maximum maintenance dose of 200 mg twice a day for adjunctive treatment and 300 mg 
twice a day for monotherapy. In case of monotherapy, treatment can also be initiated at a starting dose of 
100 mg twice a day. Vimpat may be taken with or without food. 
The application for Lacosamide Accord concerns 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg film coated tablets, 
and approval is sought for the full range of indications for the reference product Vimpat at the time of this 
report. No clinical trials (bioequivalence studies) have been performed as a BCS (Biopharmaceutics 
Classification System) based biowaiver has been requested as per Appendix III of the Guideline on the 
investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **), which states that in vivo 
bioequivalence studies may be exempted if an assumption of equivalence in in vivo performance can be 
justified by satisfactory in vitro data. 
1.4.  Quality aspects 
1.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg of 
lacosamide as active substance.

The product is available in PVC-PVDC/Aluminium blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
1.4.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of lacosamide is (R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide corresponding to 
the molecular formula C13H18N2O3 and has a relative molecular mass 250.30 g/mol and has the following 
structure: 
Figure 1 – Structure of lacosamide 
The confirmation of the chemical structure has been conducted based on IR, UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 
mass spectroscopy 
The active substance is a white to light yellow powder, non-hygroscopic, and soluble in methanol, sparingly 
soluble in water and slightly soluble in acetonitrile and ethanol. 
Lacosamide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Therefore, two isomers are 
possible, i.e. R-isomer and S-isomer. The desired isomer is R-isomer and the undesired S-isomer is 
controlled in the active substance specification by HPLC with a limit of not more than 0.15 % in line with the 
ICH Q3A Guideline. 
Since, according to literature, lacosamide exhibits polymorphism (four crystalline forms are possible), XRD 
and DSC studies were done to confirm the polymorphic form of lacosamide manufactured by the ASMFH. 
Results of XRD data and DSC data of three commercial scale batches showed that polymorphic Form-I is 
consistently produced.

Manufacture 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part 
of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Lacosamide is manufactured by non-sterile and non-aseptic process in an active substance manufacturing 
facility. 
Lacosamide is synthesized in 5 main stages following by purification of the active substance using 
commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specification.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The audit of the active substance manufacturer/s and intermediate manufacturer/s have been carried out 
by the ASMF holder or active substance manufacturer itself and thus the CHMP was of the opinion that they 
cannot be listed as a contract acceptor in the QP declaration due to possible conflict of interest. Therefore, 
the CHMP recommended the 3 QP declarations should thus be revised accordingly and to provide adequate 
justification from all 3 QPs involved that they are satisfied with audit results in spite of potential conflict of 
interest and respective authorities to look into the issue at the next re-inspection of these sites in question. 
This should be provided before the marketing of the product. 
The active substance is packaged in transparent polyethylene bag and tied with strip seal, which is placed in 
another transparent polyethylene bag and tied with strip seal. Finally packed material placed in HDPE drum, 
the  lid  of  the  drum  is  closed  by  a  clamp.  The  materials  comply  with  the  EC  directive  2002/72/EC  and  EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), solubility (Ph. Eur.), identification 
(IR, HPLC, XRD), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), specific optical 
rotation (Ph. Eur.), chiral related substances (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), dimethyl sulfate content 
(HPLC), acetic acid content (GC), particle size (Malvern Analyzer), and microbial examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (6 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 5 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for 48 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up 
Assessment report  
EMA/518597/2017

to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification, water content, chiral related substances, 
enantiomeric purity, related substances, assay, and appearance of solution. 
All principal physical and chemical parameters were well within the proposed limits during the accelerated 
and long term storage conditions without showing any sign of degradation. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when preserve in tight 
containers and store at 25°C, with excursions permitted to 15°C – 30°C in the proposed container. 
1.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Lacosamide  tablets  are  presented  in  four  strengths;  50  mg,  100  mg,  150  mg  and  200  mg.  The  finished 
product is presented as follows: 
Lacosamide  50  mg  film-coated  tablets:  pink,  oval,  coated  tablets,  debossed  “L”  on  one  side  and  “50”  on 
other side. 
Lacosamide  100  mg  film-coated  tablets:  dark  yellow,  oval,  coated  tablets,  debossed  “L”  on  one  side  and 
“100” on other side. 
Lacosamide 150 mg film-coated tablets: salmon, oval, coated tablets, debossed “L” on one side and “150” 
on other side. 
Lacosamide 200 mg film-coated tablets: blue, oval, coated tablets, debossed “L” on one side and “200” on 
other side. 
The aim of the development was to formulate a robust, physicochemically similar, stable, dose weight 
similar and bio-waiver compliant (based on BCS class I) generic formulation of Lacosamide 50/100/150/200 
mg film-coated tablets, compared to the reference product Vimpat. This was achieved by developing a 
stable formulation and carrying out dissolution profile matching of the generic and reference medicinal 
products. 
Various  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  the  active  substance  are  affected  by  their  particle  size, 
distribution  and  shape.  The  effect  is  not  only  on  the  physical  properties  of  the  solid  but  also  their 
biopharmaceutical behaviour, content uniformity, solubility and stability. As shown in literature information, 
the  active  is  classified  as  highly  soluble  (BCS  class  I)  and  particle  size  does  not  have  any  impact  on 
dissolution. The particle size is not expected to impact the quality of product. The solubility of lacosamide at 
different pH range of the gastrointestinal tract was determined to aid in selecting suitable dissolution media 
for development purpose and to ensure that ‘sink conditions’ are maintained therein. Minimum solubility to 
claim  the  sink  condition  for  lacosamide  is  0.667  mg/ml.  The  pH  solubility  profile  indicates  that  the 
lacosamide is highly soluble and sink conditions are possible throughout the gastro-intestinal pH range.

A compatibility study of lacosamide with different excipients (including those used in the reference product) 
was carried out by accelerated thermal stress study. Compatibility studies were carried out using different 
active  substance  and  excipients  ratio.  No  significant  changes  were  observed.  Hence,  based  on  the  active 
substance  -  excipients  compatibility  study  results,  it  can  be  concluded  that  lacosamide  is  compatible  with 
the studied excipients. 
Excipients considered for the generic medicinal product were selected based on reference medicinal product 
and active substance-excipient compatibility study. All the excipients are tested and found to comply with 
current individual Ph. Eur. monograph / EU directive and film-coating materials are tested and found to 
comply with in-house specification. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The finished product development trials were initiated considering the below requirements: 
1) Bio-waiver strategy (as it is a BCS class I active substance, lacosamide has been proven to exhibit high 
solubility and complete absorption). 
2) Similarity in dissolution profile at pH 1.2 (0.1N HCl), Acetate buffer pH 4.5 and Phosphate buffer pH 6.8 
when compared to the reference medicinal product, Vimpat. 
Lacosamide exhibits poor flow properties. As this may impact the quality parameters of the product direct 
compression  approach  was  not  considered  suitable  for  manufacture  of  lacosamide  tablets.  Hence,  it  was 
decided to use wet granulation approach for the manufacturing of the finished product. 
The formulation was optimised for the functional excipients by varying its concentration of finalised limits as 
established in developmental trials. The formulation optimisation trials have been conducted on the higher 
strength, i.e. 200 mg. The trials were carried out to optimise the concentration of functional excipients used 
in the formulation. 
No clinical trials (i.e. bioequivalence studies) have been carried on the product as a BCS based biowaiver is 
requested  for  lacosamide  film-coated  tablets  as  per  Appendix  III  of  guideline  on  the  investigation  of 
bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). 
As  per  the  guideline  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1/  Corr  **,  in  vivo  bioequivalence  studies  may  be 
exempted  if  an  assumption  of  equivalence  in  in  vivo  performance  can  be  justified  by  satisfactory  in  vitro 
data.  Applying  for  a  BCS  based  bio-waiver  is  restricted  to  highly  soluble  active  substances  with  known 
human absorption, which are considered not to have a narrow therapeutic index. The concept is applicable 
to immediate release, solid pharmaceutical products for oral administration and systemic action having the 
same pharmaceutical form. 
It  has  been  demonstrated  in  this  case  that  the  BCS  based  bio-waiver  is  applicable  because  the  active 
substance  (lacosamide)  has  been  proven  to  exhibit  high  solubility  and  complete  absorption  (BCS  class  I) 
and  not  have  a  narrow  therapeutic  index,  very  rapid  (more  than  85  %  within  15  min) in  vitro  dissolution 
characteristics of the test and reference product has been demonstrated across the required pH range and 
excipients  that  might  affect  bioavailability  are  qualitatively  the  same  in  both  test  and  reference  product. 
Moreover,  the  impurity  profile  of  the  generic  finished  product  was  compared  with  the  impurity  profile  of 
reference  product.  The  impurity  profile  was  found  to  be  similar  to  that  of  the  reference  product.  As  no 
additional impurities observed in test product, it can be considered to be essentially similar to the reference 
product.

As demonstrated by the pH solubility profile study, lacosamide is BCS class I molecule have high solubility 
and  sink  condition  is  possible  across  the  pH  range  of  1.2  to  7.5.  After  considering  solubility  and 
pharmacokinetic behaviour, 0.1N HCl medium was selected for routing testing of lacosamide tablets. 
The multimedia dissolution profile comparison was performed on following dissolution media: 0.1N HCl, pH 
4.5 acetate buffer, pH 6.8 phosphate buffer 
The discriminatory nature of the selected dissolution method was demonstrated. 
To  optimize  the  manufacturing  process  parameters,  the  trials  were  carried  out  for  manufacturing  of  the 
finished product. 
The primary packaging is PVC-PVDC/Aluminum blisters. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  6  main  steps:  granulation,  drying,  sizing,  blending  (lubrication), 
compression and film-coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended 
quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description  (visual),  average  weight  of  tablet,  identification  (HPLC,  IR,  Chiral  method),  water  content  (Ph. 
Eur.),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution,  related  substances  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  and 
microbial examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  appropriately  validated  in  accordance 
with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used  for  assay  and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches per strength confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The  finished  product  is  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  above  release  specifications,  through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  3  production  scale  batches  for  each  strength  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term 
conditions for 12 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 
75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/518597/2017 
Page 11/20 
 
  
  
Samples  were  tested  for  the  same  specifications  as  release.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability 
indicating. 
The  tests  performed  during  long  term  and  accelerate  stability  studies  complied  with  the  specifications  and 
well within the acceptance criteria. 
Stability  data  of  2  production  scale  batches  for  each  strength  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term 
conditions for 12 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 
75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to 
those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  polypropylene  copolymer  (PPCP)  container  which  is  the 
transportation/bulk  storage  pack.  The  tests  performed  during  long  term  and  accelerated  stability  studies 
complied  with  the  specifications  and  results  were  well  within  the  acceptance criteria.  Based  on  satisfactory 
stability data on PPCP container, 12 month storage period is assigned for PPCP container. 
In  addition, two batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No changes were observed, therefore, it was concluded that the film-
coated tablets are photo-stable. 
Forced  degradation  study  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  likely  degradation  products  and  to  validate  the 
stability indicating power of the analytical procedures by using forced degradation samples. The degradation 
study was carried out on 50 mg strength and is considered applicable for other strengths. The degradation 
conditions used were: acid degradation (1M HCl at 60°C for 24 hours), base degradation (1M NaOH at room 
temperature  for  18  hour),  oxidation  degradation  (30%  H2O2  at  60°C  for  24  hours),  thermal  degradation 
(105°C for 72 hours), UV degradation and water hydrolysis (water at 60°C for 72 hours).  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
1.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

1.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- 
The audit of the active substance manufacturer/s and intermediate manufacturer/s have been carried 
out by the ASMF holder or active substance manufacturer itself and due to possible conflict of interest 
they cannot be listed as a contract acceptor in the QP declaration. Therefore, the 3 QP declarations 
should thus be revised accordingly and to provide adequate justification from all 3 QPs involved that 
they are satisfied with audit results in spite of potential conflict of interest and respective authorities 
to look into the issue at the next re-inspection of these sites in question. This should be provided 
before the marketing of the product. 
1.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
1.5.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
1.5.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction 
of Lacosamide Accord is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales 
volumes for all lacosamide containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active 
substance. Thus, the Environmental Risk Assessment is expected to be similar and not increased. 
1.5.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview adequately discusses pharmacological and toxicological literature. No issues 
were raised with respect to the excipients or impurities. All non-clinical information has been adequately 
reflected in the SmPC in line with the reference product. 
Therefore, the CHMP agrees that Lacosamide Accord is approvable from a non-clinical point of view. 
1.6.  Clinical aspects  
1.6.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for a generic product consisting of film-coated tablets containing 50 mg, 100 mg, 
Assessment report  
EMA/518597/2017 
Page 13/20 
 
  
  
150 mg and 200 mg of lacosamide. No bioequivalence studies have been carried as a BCS-based biowaiver 
has been requested. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well 
as efficacy and safety of lacosamide based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of 
the reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
Exemption  
In line with Appendix III of the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1/ Corr **), in vivo bioequivalence studies may be exempted if an assumption of equivalence in in 
vivo performance can be justified by satisfactory in vitro data. BCS based biowaivers are restricted to 
highly soluble drug substances with known human absorption and considered not to have a narrow 
therapeutic index. The concept is applicable to immediate release, solid pharmaceutical products for oral 
administration and systemic action having the same pharmaceutical form. 
The applicant has submitted a BCS Class I based biowaiver request for which the following requirements 
must be met: 
• 
• 
• 
The drug substance has been proven to exhibit high solubility and complete absorption (BCS class I), 
and  
either very rapid (> 85 % within 15 min) or similarly rapid (85 % within 30 min) in vitro dissolution 
characteristics of the test and reference product have been demonstrated, and  
excipients that might affect bioavailability are qualitatively and quantitatively the same.  
The applicant’s justification for the applicability of the bio-waiver to lacosamide film-coated tablets is 
summarised below: 
1. Drug substance 
Lacosamide is not considered a narrow therapeutic index drug based on the following evidences: 
• 
• 
Treatment  emergent  adverse  events  reported  during  long-term  open-label  trials  did  not  differ  from 
those  reported  in  shorter-term  randomized  trials,  suggesting  that  long-term  lacosamide  therapy  is 
not  associated  with  emergence  of  unexpected  adverse  events,  and  that  the  incidence  of  overall 
adverse events does not increase with continuing exposure to lacosamide.   
The  median  effective  dose  (ED50)  value  in  rats  against  tonic-extension  seizures  induced  by  the 
maximal electroshock seizure is 3.9 mg/kg, p.o. (Beyreuther BK et al. 2007). The estimated median 
lethal  dose  (LD50)  value  in  rats  is  253  mg/kg,  p.o.  respectively  (Product  monograph  Vimpat®).  The 
difference between the LD50 and ED50 is large.  
Lacosamide has been shown to exhibit high solubility and complete absorption in line with BCS class I. 
Solubility has been tested in different media with different pH. These data show that a single dose of 
200 mg in an immediate release formulation is completely dissolved in 250 ml of buffers within the pH 
range of 1 – 7.5 at 37±1°C. Furthermore, lacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral 
administration of the tablets with a bioavailability of approximately 100%. Hence, lacosamide shows high 
permeability.

2. Drug product 
The applicant has provided in vitro dissolution data investigating the similarity of dissolution profiles 
between test product (lacosamide film-coated tablets 50/100/150/200mg; manufactured by Intas 
Pharmaceutical Ltd, India) and reference product (Vimpat® 50/100/150/200mg film-coated tablets 
marketed by UCB Pharma SA, Belgium) in different dissolution media. Different batches of the test and 
reference product for all 4 strengths were used. 
The dissolution conditions and method used were in line with Appendix III of the Guideline on 
Bioequivalence and are presented below: 
Apparatus: 
Volume of dissolution medium: 
Paddle 
900 ml 
Temperature of dissolution medium: 
37±0.5 °C 
Agitation speed: 
Sampling schedule: 
Buffer: 
50 rpm 
10, 15, 20, 30 and 45 min 
(a) 0.1 N HCl  
(b) pH 4.5 acetate buffer 
(c) pH 6.8 phosphate buffer 
From the comparative dissolution study, lacosamide film-coated tablets showed very rapid (more than 85% 
within 15 min) in vitro dissolution characteristics for both the rest and reference product for all three 
buffers/pH. The results were consistent across all batches analysed. 
3. Excipients 
The excipients used in the test product (lacosamide film-coated tablets 50/100/150/200 mg; manufactured 
by Intas Pharmaceutical Ltd, India) and the reference product (Vimpat® 50/100/150/200mg film-coated 
tablets marketed by UCB Pharma SA, Belgium) are qualitatively the same, except for Lecithin (soya), which 
is only present in the film-coating of Lacosamide Accord tablets. The quantitative differences of the 
excipients were considered unlikely to affect the bioavailability of lacosamide. All of the excipients are well 
established and are used at concentrations commonly used in the preparation of immediate release tablets. 
At these concentrations none of the excipients is expected to affect the oral bioavailability of lacosamide. 
Furthermore, there is no safety or clinical concern regarding the presence of any of these excipients in this 
formulation. This was agreed by the CHMP, who also agreed that the change in the coating components 
compared to the reference product would not affect the bioavailability of lacosamide. 
1.6.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
1.6.3.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

1.6.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This marketing authorisation application for Lacosamide Accord is a generic application referring to the 
centrally authorised product Vimpat. As such, no new efficacy or safety studies have been conducted and 
are not required. Furthermore, no bioequivalence study was performed on the product due to a BCS-based 
biowaiver as per Appendix III of the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). The applicant demonstrated that lacosamide is highly soluble 
and the oral bioavailability is approximately 100%. Furthermore, lacosamide is considered a broad 
therapeutic index drug and in vitro dissolution data showed very rapid dissolution characteristics for both 
Lacosamide Accord and Vimpat® film-coated tablets (more than 85% within 15 min). Finally, the excipients 
in the generic medicinal product at the concentrations used were considered unlikely to affect the oral 
bioavailability of lacosamide. 
1.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the available data, the CHMP considered that all criteria for a BCS-based biowaiver were met. 
Therefore the absence of a bioequivalence study was considered justified and the CHMP concluded that no 
clinical data were needed to support the application for Lacosamide Accord 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 
200 mg film-coated tablets as a generic medicinal product to Vimpat.

1.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
1.9.  Product information 
1.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Vimpat. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has 
been found acceptable. 
2.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of lacosamide film-coated tablets (50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 
200 mg). The reference product Vimpat is indicated as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adult and adolescent (16-
18 years) patients with epilepsy.  
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
nor the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
Furthermore, no bioequivalence study was conducted since the product met the criteria for a BCS-based 
biowaiver in accordance with Appendix III of the Guideline on investigation of bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **).  
A benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond 
those included in the product information.

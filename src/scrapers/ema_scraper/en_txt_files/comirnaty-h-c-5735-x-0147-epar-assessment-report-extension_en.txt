2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV2. The virus first emerged as 
a human pathogen in Wuhan province in China and has spread world-wide causing a pandemic. The 
WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus infects the airways and 
causes a broad spectrum of respiratory infection from asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). 
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has repeatedly evolved and appeared in several variants causing new waves of 
infection. The variants have so far shown cross-reactivity with the original strain, which was the base 
for the currently approved vaccines. However, there is a concern that presently circulating virus 
variants are less cross-reactive with the original strain. The variant causing the latest waves of disease 
at the time of this application has been the Omicron variant, with several subvariants beginning with 
BA.1. Currently BA.5 is dominating in the EU.

EMA/889536/2022  
Page 6/38 
 
 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
All ages may present with the disease, but notably, case fatality rates (CFR) are elevated in persons 
>60 years of age. Comorbidities are also associated with increased CFR, including cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic respiratory disease. Healthcare workers are over-
represented among COVID-19 patients due to occupational exposure to infected patients.  
There are currently several vaccines approved for prevention of COVID-19 in adolescents, adults, 
elderly and children 5 to 11 years old. COVID-19 in children is mostly a mild disease although severe 
cases occur rarely, particularly in those with underlying, predisposing comorbidities. 
Cumulatively, since the pandemic began, children represent about 1 in 5 reported cases in the US. 
Similarly, in Europe, COVID-19 cases surged the highest within the paediatric population <15 years of 
age during the Delta wave in July through September 2021, and also during the Omicron wave in 
January through March 2022. Although the severity of COVID-19 disease in children is substantially 
lower compared to adults, concerns have been raised that COVID-19 symptoms may be associated 
with more severe disease in children with chronic health conditions. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with four structural proteins. One of them, the Spike protein is a surface 
protein which binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) present on host cells. Therefore, the 
Spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development and is the main antigen in all 
currently developed vaccines against COVID-19.  
While the efficacy of available vaccines, emulating the Wuhan strain, against severe disease appears 
largely retained, efficacy against symptomatic disease due to omicron variants is obviously reduced. 
Moreover, the duration of protection with the original may be reduced given that the emerging variant 
is less sensitive than the original target. 
It is generally considered that protection may be optimised by a vaccine with a sequence that is as 
close to the circulating variant as possible. To optimize the broadness of the immune response to 
SARS-CoV-2 in the present situation, regulatory bodies (ICMRA) and WHO have suggested that a 
bivalent vaccine including both original as well as an omicron variant may be desirable. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
COVID-19 presentation is generally with cough and fever, with chest radiography showing ground-
glass opacities or patchy shadowing. However, many patients present without fever or radiographic 
changes, and infections may be asymptomatic which is relevant to controlling transmission. For 
symptomatic patients, disease progression may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring 
ventilation, subsequent multi-organ failure, and death. COVID-19 caused by Omicron lineage generally 
presents with upper airways symptoms, cough and fever. 
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined COVID 19 symptoms as 
including 1 or more of the following:  fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of 
breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion or runny nose, or nausea.

2.1.5.  Management 
Currently available therapies have different benefit-risk considerations depending on the stage of 
illness and disease manifestations. While care for individuals who have COVID-19 has improved with 
clinical experience, vaccination is the most effective medical countermeasure to decrease risk and 
mitigate spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the ongoing pandemic. At this stage, there is no 
approved COVID-19 vaccine including BA.4-5 for children aged 5-<12 years of age. 
2.2.  About the product 
Conditional marketing authorization was granted for Comirnaty 30 µg on 21 December 2020 for 
individuals ≥16 years of age and was later expanded on 28 May 2021 to include individuals ≥12 years 
of age. Comirnaty 10 µg for children 5-<12 years of age was approved in EU on 26 November 2021. 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15+15µg) was approved 1 sept 2022 and Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15+15µg) was approved 12 Sept 2022. Both bivalent vaccines are approved 
for participants ≥12 years of age. Comirnaty was granted the status of standard marketing 
authorisation on 10 October 2022. 
The BNT162b2 Bivalent (BNT162b2 +BNT162b2 OMI BA.4/BA.5) variant vaccine (herein described to 
as Bivalent) is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in aqueous 
cryoprotectant buffer for IM administration. The BNT162b2 Bivalent vaccine 10 µg consists of 
nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding equal amounts of both a pre-fusion stabilized 
full-length variant of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein (Original strain) and the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 
variant, 5 µg each. The BNT162b2 Bivalent drug product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM 
Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 7.4. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pfizer and BioNTech have developed the Comirnaty vaccine to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on SARS CoV-2 spike (S) 
glycoprotein antigens encoded in RNA and formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). 
There are two approved formulations of Comirnaty vaccine: 
- 
- 
PBS/Sucrose finished product or Comirnaty, 30 micrograms/dose, concentrate for dispersion 
for injection which received a conditional approval 21 December 2020 (EMEA/H/C/005735) 
Tris/Sucrose finished product or Comirnaty, 30 micrograms/dose, dispersion for injection, 
approved 3 November 2021 (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044) 
The primarily difference is the buffer used for finished product formulation and requirement for dilution 
prior to administration. The Tris/Sucrose finished product (Comirnaty dispersion for injection) is 
formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 7.4 and is filled into vials at 
2.25 mL fill volume, providing 6 doses of 30 μg RNA in 0.3 mL injection volume. 
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple mutations have led to development of variant 
vaccine constructs, specifically, the Omicron (BA.4/BA.5) as a variant of concern (VOC): 
- 
Tris/Sucrose finished product, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, (15/15 micrograms/dose, 
dispersion for injection, approved 12 September 2022 (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0143) 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/889536/2022  
Page 8/38 
 
 
 
The bivalent vaccine is manufactured by mixing two active substance  RNA constructs in an 
approximately 1:1 ratio prior to the lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formation and stabilization step. The 
bivalent finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 
7.4. 
To assist in the public health crisis, a new paediatric 10 μg bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) finished 
product is being introduced in this line extension. Different dosage presentations for different age 
groups are already approved for the original Comirnaty vaccine which differ only in the fill volume and 
requirement for dilution prior to administration: 
- 
Comirnaty, 30 micrograms/dose, dispersion for injection, approved 3 November 2021 
(EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044). The 30 μg RNA dosage presentation is filled at 2.25 mL per vial 
and is administered without dilution, providing 6 doses, each containing a 30 μg RNA dose in 
0.3 mL injection volume for individuals 12+ years of age. 
- 
Comirnaty, 10 micrograms/dose, concentrate for dispersion for injection, approved 26 
November 2021 (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077). The 10 μg RNA dosage presentation is filled at 
1.3 mL per vial and requires dilution with 1.3 mL 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration, 
providing 10 doses, each containing a 10 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL injection volume for 
individuals 5 to <12 years of age. 
- 
Comirnaty, 3 micrograms/dose, concentrate for dispersion for injection, approved 20 October 
2022 (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138). The 3 μg RNA dosage presentation is filled at 0.4 mL per 
vial and requires dilution with 2.2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration, providing 
10 doses, each containing a 3 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL injection volume for infants and children 
from 6 months to 4 years of age. 
- 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection, approved 
1 September 2022 (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0140). This presentation is filled at 2.25 mL per vial 
and is administered without dilution, providing 6 doses, each containing a dose of 15 μg 
tozinameran and 15 μg riltozinameran in 0.3 mL injection volume for individuals 12+ years of 
age. 
- 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection, 
approved 12 September 2022 (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0140). This presentation is filled at 2.25 
mL per vial and is administered without dilution, providing 6 doses, each containing a dose of 
15 μg tozinameran and 15 μg famtozinameran in 0.3 mL injection volume for individuals 12+ 
years of age. 
To support introduction of the 10 μg dose, this submission leverages the substantial supportive process 
and characterization information that was submitted for both the original Tris/Sucrose and bivalent 
finished products in prior variations, while also providing content specifically supporting introduction of 
the 10 μg dose. 
- 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection is the 
subject of this procedure (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0147). is filled at 1.3 mL per vial and requires 
dilution with 1.3 mL 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each 
containing a 5 μg tozinameran and 5 μg famtozinameran in 0.2 mL injection volume for 
individuals 5 to <12 years of age.

2.3.2.  Active Substance 
The active substances tozinameran and famtozinameran are already approved for the original 
Comirnaty vaccine formulations (EU/1/20/1528/001-010). No changes to the information are 
proposed. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2 . 3 . 3 . 1 .     Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The bivalent vaccine finished product 10 μg RNA dose is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of RNA-
containing lipid nanoparticles in an aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for intramuscular administration. The 
bivalent finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 
7.4 and contains an approximate 1:1 ratio of the original and omicron (BA.4/BA.5) variant strains. The 
bivalent finished product is filled at 1.3 mL fill volume, requires dilution with 1.3 mL 0.9% sodium 
chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each a 10 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL injection 
volume. Each strain, original and omicron (BA.4/BA.5), is present at approximately 5 μg/dose. 
The qualitative and quantitative composition is provided in Table P.1-1. 
Table P.1-1. Composition of Bivalent Finished Product, 10 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL Injection 
Volume, 10 Dose Multi-dose Vials 
All excipients except the functional lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159, the structural lipid DSPC and the 
buffer component TRIS HCl comply to Ph. Eur. grade. The functional lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159, 
the structural lipid DSPC and the buffer component TRIS HCl are all used in the currently approved 
Tris/Sucrose and PBS/Sucrose finished products of Comirnaty. 
The container closure system is a 2 mL Type I borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and a 13 mm 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and is the same container closure system as for the already approved 
Tris/Sucrose finished product of Comirnaty. 
The processing aids and active substance formulation buffer components are residues that are 
essentially removed through the manufacturing process and are not considered as ingredients 
(excipients).

Pharmaceutical Development 
The section has been updated in this Line extension application (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0147) compared 
to the already approved procedures EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077 and EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0143. 
A revised QTPP has been developed for the bivalent vaccine to include the bivalent 10 µg presentation. 
No changes have been made compared to the QTPP for the original vaccine in Tris/Sucrose formulation 
except for a reflection of the use of two strains of mRNA, the inclusion of RNA ratio as a quality 
attribute and that the claimed shelf-life is 12 months. 
No change in physicochemical properties, processability and stability is expected for the bivalent 
vaccine compared to the original vaccine in the Tris/Sucrose formulation. 
The section on manufacturing process development and characterization has been updated to include 
vial content specification of 1.3 mL fill volume for the bivalent 10 µg presentation. 
Comparability 
Comparability has previously been acceptably demonstrated between clinical and commercial scale 
original finished product, between various manufacturing sites and between the PBS/Sucrose finished 
product and Tris/Sucrose finished product via comprehensive studies including both release testing and 
extended characterization testing. Due to the application of the same formulation, manufacturing 
process, and the use of the same manufacturing sites as the original finished product, extensive prior 
experience is leveraged, and it is found acceptable and sufficient that comparability has been 
established between the bivalent vaccine finished product to the original finished product based on an 
evaluation of release testing results against the acceptance criteria in the finished product 
specification. 
For the bivalent 10 µg presentation of finished product, batch analysis data are provided in section 
3.2.P.5.4 for the batches manufactured to date. 
In conclusion, the information provided in section 3.2.P.2 on Pharmaceutical development is found 
sufficient and acceptable. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The bivalent BA.4-5 vaccine (5/5 micrograms)/dose is manufactured at the same manufacturing sites, 
and using the same platform process, as currently approved Comirnaty vaccines (Tris/Sucrose 
formulation) (EU/1/20/1528/002-010). The GMP compliance of these sites has been previously 
confirmed. 
The manufacturing process consists of four major manufacturing steps – LNP fabrication, bulk finished 
product formation, sterile filtration and aseptic filling. The manufacturing process is the same as for the 
bivalent BA.4-5 vaccine (15/15 micrograms)/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0143) except for a different 
fill volume. The commercial batch size is XX L of finished product solution corresponding to a maximum 
of approximately XX vials at 1.3 mL fill volume. The manufacturing process is sufficiently described, 
and suitable in-process controls (IPCs) are applied. 
No process validation is performed for the bivalent BA.4-5 vaccine (5/5 micrograms)/dose. This is 
found acceptable since this line extension is a combination of the approved vaccines Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 micrograms)/dose and Comirnaty 10 microgram/dose.

content (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), DSPC content (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), Cholesterol content (HPLC-
CAD, HPLC-ELSD), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), Lipid identities (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), Identity of 
encoded RNA sequence (ddPCR), Potency / in Vitro Expression (Cell-based flow cytometry), RNA

Container Closure Integrity (Dye incursion). 
The specification includes a comprehensive set of relevant tests with corresponding acceptance criteria 
and are based on those established for the original finished product for the majority of the test 
attributes. The acceptance criteria for release and stability testing of the bivalent finished product are 
the same as for the original vaccine for all quality attributes except for the RNA ratio that is related to 
the mixing of the original and omicron (BA.4/BA.5) strains. In addition, the vial content (volume) 
acceptance criteria are updated to 1.3 mL fill volume for the bivalent 10 µg dose presentation as well 
as a new procedure number for subvisible particles is added. 
Since the acceptance criteria for the bivalent vaccine finished product are based on the currently 
approved original vaccine finished product for the majority of test attributes, these acceptance criteria 
for test attributes are considered as clinically qualified to ensure quality, efficacy and safety. 
The vial content (volume) for Tris/Sucrose finished product was determined to ensure that each 1.3 mL 
filled vial can deliver up to ten 10 μg doses of 0.2 mL each, following the addition of 1.3 mL 0.9% 
sodium chloride. The provided justification for vial content (volume) of 1.3 mL is found acceptable. 
For the RNA ratio, a limit for the original and the omicron strains is proposed which, however, is not 
supported by the submitted batch data. No additional justification is provided. It is acknowledged that 
the experience is limited to a small number of finished product lots, manufactured from a limited 
number of active substance batches. Therefore, when a sufficient number of BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(Wildtype and Omicron) Finished Product batches are manufactured, the MAH will reassess the 
proposed specification for the RNA ratio by Q2 2023 as an outcome of variation 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0140 (current REC 29). This is found acceptable. 
Batch analysis data for the bivalent 10 µg vaccine finished product presentation have been provided for 
the four commercial scale batches GH9545, GH9702, GJ5342 and GK1657, all manufactured at Pfizer, 
Puurs. All results met the acceptance criteria at the time of release. 
In addition, stability studies are ongoing for the commercial scale batches GH9545 and GK1657. 
This is found acceptable. 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life for the bivalent vaccine finished product is 12 months when stored at the 
recommended storage temperature of -90 to -60°C, including short term storage at 5 ± 3°C for up to 
10 weeks (within the 12-month shelf-life). 
The proposed shelf-life is based on the shelf-life for the original Tris/Sucrose finished product, which is 
based on stability data obtained at the intended storage condition (-90 to -60°C) as well as the 
accelerated storage conditions (5 ± 3°C) during primary stability studies. Release data are available 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/889536/2022

for the bivalent finished product from the clinical lot 22-DP-01216 and the commercial scale 
confirmatory lot GH9545 and GK1657 at the intended storage condition (-90 to -60°C) as well as at 
the accelerated storage conditions (5 ± 3°C). These stability studies are currently on-going and data 
from these studies will be used to confirm the shelf-life of the bivalent finished product. The original 
Tris/Sucrose studies are also on-going and will be used to extend the shelf-life based on the 
acceptability of the data. 
This approach to extrapolate the shelf-life from the already authorized original vaccine to the bivalent 
vaccine finished product is found acceptable since comparability has previously been acceptably 
demonstrated for a number of various comparisons of Comirnaty finished product such as between 
clinical and commercial scale original finished product, between various manufacturing sites and 
between the PBS/Sucrose finished product and the Tris/Sucrose finished product. Comparability has 
been demonstrated via comprehensive studies including both release testing and extended 
characterization testing. Due to the application of the same formulation, manufacturing process, and 
the use of the same manufacturing sites as the original finished product, extensive prior experience is 
leveraged for the bivalent finished product and comparability previously convincingly proven and 
concluded. 
Therefore, the proposed shelf-life for the bivalent vaccine finished product of 12 months when stored 
at the recommended storage temperature of -90 to -60°C, including a short-term storage at 5 ± 3°C 
for up to 10 weeks (within the 12-month shelf-life). This is in-line with the wording in section 6.3 in the 
SmPC is agreed. 
This is found acceptable. 
2.3.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s) 
Not applicable. 
2.3.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
The active substances (tozinameran and famtozinameran) are identical to that used for the currently 
approved Comirnaty vaccine formulations (EU/1/20/1528/001-010). Consequently, there are no 
changes to the active substance sections and full reference is made to the active substance data of 
Comirnaty, concentrate for dispersion for injection (EMEA/H/C/005735). Adequate testing for 
bioburden, endotoxins and sterility are also included at appropriate stages of the manufacturing 
process of the finished product. 
2.3.3.7.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.3.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The  MAH  should  reassess  and  optimise  the  proposed  specification  for  the  RNA  ratio,  when  a 
sufficient number of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Wildtype and Omicron) Finished Product batches have 
been manufactured. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
Not applicable 
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
No clinical studies including efficacy or immunogenicity were submitted in the current application 
concerning booster dose with Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5) micrograms/dose for the age group 5-
<12-year-old children. 
Safety data have been submitted from study C4591044 cohort 2 in which 503 participants ≥12 years 
received either Original/BA.4-5 30µg or 60µg. Furthermore reference is made to study C4591031 
Substudy D and E which included bivalent Original/BA.1 and was evaluated previously in 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0140. None of the studies include children aged 5-<12 years of age. 
2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Not applicable 
2.5.3.  Clinical efficacy 
The regulatory strategy proposed is to approve Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5) micrograms/dose for 
the age group 5-<12-year-old children without efficacy data.  
The efficacy was demonstrated for original Comirnaty vaccine, where the efficacy against COVID-19 is 
demonstrated for all age groups from 6 months old and upwards for primary series and for booster in 
12 years old and upwards. Immunobridging has been accepted for the approval of booster dose of 
original Comirnaty 10 µg for 5-<12-year-olds (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0129). 
The approval of bivalent BA.1 and BA.4/5 in older age groups (at least 12 years and older) as a 
booster was based on immunogenicity data of bivalent variant-adapted vaccine Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15) micrograms/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/140). Original/Omicron BA.4/5 
(15/15) (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/143) immunogenicity was extrapolated from a study with Comirnaty 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/889536/2022  
Page 14/38 
 
 
 
Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15) micrograms/dose. Study C4591044 which evaluates Original/Omicron 
BA.4/5 (15/15) is ongoing. Safety and immunogenicity (all participants) using validated BA.4/BA.5 
neutralisation assay, are expected by December 2022/January 2023. 
Efficacy of primary and booster doses of the original Comirnaty was demonstrated in clinical efficacy 
studies in participants from 12 years of age (2 doses + booster 30 µg), 5-<12 years of age (2 doses of 
10 µg) and 6 months to 5 year of age (3 doses of 3 µg). In addition, immunogenicity data support the 
efficacy of a bivalent original/omicron BA.1 vaccine 15/15 µg, which has also been approved from 12 
years of age. The bivalent Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine induced superior antibody titres to 
BA.1 compared to the original Comirnaty, and non-inferior response to the Wuhan strain. No data of 
immunogenicity of Original/Omicron BA.1 among children below 12 years of age is available. 
The MAH is planning extension of Study C4591048, which will study safety and immunogenicity of age-
adapted Original/Omicron BA.4-5 among children 6 months to 12 years of age, as agreed in the PIP. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Currently there are no immunogenicity or efficacy data of Original/Omicron BA.4-5, 5/5 µg as a 
booster dose among 5-<12-years-old children. These data are expected to be collected during study 
C4591048.  
The bivalent Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine induced superior antibody titres to BA.1 
compared to the original Comirnaty, and non-inferior response to the Wuhan strain. No data of 
immunogenicity of Original/Omicron BA.1 among children below 12 years of age is available. It is 
anticipated that the updated bivalent variant vaccine Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is immunogenically 
superior to neutralise BA.4-5 and non-inferior to neutralise Wuhan in comparison to Original 
Comirnaty.  Immunogenicity data to confirm this assumption are expected post-approval for persons 
12 years of age and older from study C4591044 cohort 2. There is a planned extension of study 
C4591048 to evaluate immunogenicity of Original/BA.4-5 5/5 µg for 5-<12 year olds and 1.5/1.5 µg 
for 6 months to <5 age old groups (REC). 
In addition, pre-clinical data support that the BA.5 variant-adapted mRNA can induce antibodies 
against omicron BA.5 (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/143). 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The bivalent Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine induced superior antibody titres to BA.1 
compared to the original Comirnaty, and non-inferior response to the Wuhan strain. It is anticipated 
that the updated bivalent variant vaccine Original/Omicron BA.4/5 is immunogenically superior to 
neutralise BA.4/5 and non-inferior to neutralise Wuhan in comparison to Original Comirnaty.  
Pre-clinical data support that the BA.5 variant-adapted mRNA can induce antibodies against omicron 
BA.5. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: The delivery of 
immunogenicity and safety data from study C4591044 for age group 12-17 years of age and 
C4591048 for the age group between 5 – 11 years of age (REC). 
2.5.6.  Clinical safety 
To support the inclusion of children aged 5-<12 years to receive a booster dose (dose 4) of the 
bivalent vaccine Original/ BA.4-5 5/5µg, the MAH has referred to study C4591031 Substudy D and E 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/889536/2022

which included bivalent Original/BA.1 and was evaluated previously in EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0140. 
Furthermore, 7-day post dose safety data from study C4591044 cohort 2 in which 503 participants 
≥12 years received either Original/BA.4-5 30µg or 60µg, has been submitted. None of the studies 
includes children aged 5-<12 years of age. 
In all studies, reactogenicity and antipyretic/pain medication use was recorded for 7 days after study 
vaccination using prompts from an electronic diary (e-diary). AEs were collected from the study 
vaccination up to 1 month after the study vaccination, and serious AEs (SAEs) were collected from 
study vaccination up to 6 months post-Dose. AEs are categorized by frequency, maximum severity, 
seriousness, and relationship to study intervention using system organ class (SOC) and preferred term 
(PT) according to MedDRA. Deaths are recorded to the end of study. 
2.5.6.1.  Study C4591044 
2.5.6.1.1.  Patient exposure 
Study C4591044 is a randomized, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of new bivalent vaccines. The study vaccine candidates are divided into cohorts, which 
may be studied in a staggered or parallel manner, as required by the clinical plan. The report 
submitted presents 7 days post-dose reactogenicity and AE data for 503 participants ≥12 years of age 
in Cohort 2 who received either 30 μg or 60 μg dose of BNT162b2 bivalent Original/BA.4-5 after 
receiving 3 doses of Original 30µg. At the cut-off 7 days after first dose, none of the participants has 
been excluded from the safety population. 
The 503 participants were divided into three age groups that included about 100 participants each: 12-
17 years, 18-55 years and >55 years of age. The participants aged 12-17 years received 
Original/BA.4-5 30 µg only, whereas the two older age groups received either Original/BA.4-5 30 µg or 
60 µg as a fourth dose. All participants had previously received three doses of Comirnaty 30 µg, and a 
majority received their fourth dose ≥7 to ≤12 months after dose 3.  
 The disposition is illustrated in the table below.

Reactogenicity study C4591044 – cohort 2 
Local reactions 
Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Severe local reactions were reported by 1 
(1.0%) participant in the 12 to 17 years of age group who received a booster dose of BNT162b2 
bivalent 30-μg. No Grade 4 local reactions were reported in any group. The median onset for all local 
reactions was 1 to 2.5 days, and all events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 3 days after 
onset.

Table 4: Number (%) of participants reporting at least 1 adverse event from the study 
vaccination through 7 days after the study vaccination, by System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term – Cohort 2 – Safety Population 
Reported AEs were overall consistent with reactogenicity events that were reported as AEs (e.g., 
fatigue, injection site pain or erythema, chills, headache, myalgia), and included lymphadenopathy 
which is recognized as a potentially vaccine-related event. Non-reactogenicity type events reported in 
2 participants. 
1.  One event of a fall (accidental mechanical fall) was reported in an individual above 75 years of age 
considered by the investigator as not related to study intervention, and reported as resolved within 
1 day after onset. No cause or further detail was specified. 
2.  One event of muscle spasm was reported in an individual above 70 years of age, considered by the 
investigator as not related to study intervention, and reported as resolved within 1 day after onset. 
No cause or further detail was specified. 
Immediate Adverse Events 
One (1.0%) participant in the 12 to 17 years of age group reported an immediate AE of injection site 
erythema within 30 minutes of study vaccination. 
Related Adverse Events 
Related AE’s were reported by 7 participants and were consistent with reactogenicity events that were 
reported as AEs. Most related AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events and in the SOC of general 
disorders and administration site conditions, reported by 5 participants. Additionally, 1 case of 
lymphadenopathy was reported by 1 participant in the 18 to 55 years of age group who received 
BNT162b2 60-μg dose.

2.5.6.1.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths or SAEs were reported by participants in Cohort 2 from study vaccination through 7 days 
post vaccination.  
2.5.6.1.4.  Post marketing experience 
Surveillance of BNT162b2 post-authorisation safety data has confirmed the overall favourable benefit-
risk assessment of the vaccine. 
No post-marketing data have been submitted for the bivalent Original/BA.4-5 vaccine. 
2.5.6.2.  C4591031 Substudy D and E 
Safety results from participants >55 years of age in C4591031 Substudy E were previously assessed 
(EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0140). A brief summary of results is provided below: 
Analysis of safety data from 1840 BNT162b2-experienced participants >55 years of age who received 
BNT162b2, BNT162b2 OMI or BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 30-μg or 60-μg dose level as a booster 
(Dose 4) did not identify any new safety-related concerns.  
Reactogenicity was mostly mild to moderate and short-lived. Reactogenicity in participants who 
received a 30-μg dose level was lower, with mild to moderate injection site pain, fatigue and muscle 
pain less frequent compared to participants who received a 60-μg dose level. Fevers were reported 
infrequently. 
The adverse event (AE) profile mostly reflected reactogenicity or age-related illnesses. The observed 
safety profile across age groups demonstrates a safe and tolerable vaccine, similar to the known safety 
profile of BNT162b2. From study vaccination to 1 month post-Dose, a similar proportion of participants 
across vaccine groups reported any AE (range: 3.6% to 10.4%), with AEs generally reported at similar 
frequencies in the vaccine groups, except for participants in the BNT162b2 OMI 30 μg and BNT162b2 
+BNT162b2 OMI 60 μg groups who reported AEs more frequently (8.5% and 10.4%, respectively). 
Any severe or serious AEs (SAEs) were reported across vaccine groups by ≤0.9% and ≤1.0%, 
respectively. For participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 30 μg group, any AEs, severe 
AEs or SAEs were reported by 6.2%, 0.3%, and 0.3% of participants, respectively. 
There were few AEs of clinical interest reported across all vaccine groups. Lymphadenopathy has been 
identified as an adverse reaction causally associated with the vaccine and has been observed during 
the two-dose primary series across age groups in these studies. These events are typically mild and 
self-limited. Incidence of lymphadenopathy in the expanded cohort of Substudy E (participants >55 
years of age) was ≤1.0% (range: 0 to 1.0%) overall across the vaccine groups and 0.3% in bivalent 
BNT162b2 +BNT162b2 OMI 30 μg group. No cases of anaphylaxis, myocarditis/pericarditis, 
appendicitis, or Bell’s Palsy were reported in any group over the course of at least 1 month of follow-up 
after vaccination in individuals >55 years of age. 
Additional supportive safety data from approximately 640 participants ≥18 to ≤55 years of age in 
Study C4591031 Substudy D Cohort 2 who had a median of 1.4 months of follow-up after a booster 
dose (Dose 4) demonstrated that the tolerability and safety profile of monovalent BNT162b2 OMI 30 
μg and BNT162b2 30 μg up to 1 month after Dose 4 vaccination (to the data cut-off date) was 
acceptable and consistent with results previously reported in clinical trials for BNT162b2 30 μg in this 
age group.

2.5.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
To support the inclusion of children aged 5-<12 years to receive a booster dose (dose 4) of the 
bivalent vaccine Original/BA.4-5 5/5µg, the MAH has submitted 7-day post dose safety data from study 
C4591044 cohort 2 in which Original/BA.4-5 30µg or 60µg was used, has also been submitted. This 
included 503 participants ≥12 years of age. Furthermore, the MAH also submitted data from study 
C4591031 substudies D (18-55 years) and E (>55 years) which included bivalent Original/BA.1 and 
was evaluated previously in EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0140. Overall, this study showed acceptable 
reactogenicity for Original/BA.1 in those aged >55, and for a monovalent BA.1 vaccine in those aged 
18-55. 
None of the studies includes children aged 5-<12 years of age.  
Study C4591044 cohort 2 included in total 503 participants divided into three age groups that included 
about 100 participants each: 12-17 years, 18-55 years and >55 years of age. The participants aged 
12-17 years received Original/BA.4-5 30 µg only, whereas the two older age groups received either 
Original/BA.4-5 30 µg or 60 µg as a fourth dose. All participants had previously received three doses of 
Comirnaty 30 µg, and a majority received their fourth dose ≥7 to ≤12 months after dose 3.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/889536/2022  
Page 23/38 
 
 
 
 
 
At this stage, only safety data 7 days after dose 4 has been submitted. No other vaccine than the 
bivalent Original/BA.4-5 and no placebo groups was included in the study. Therefore, there is no 
randomised reference group. 
Pain at injection site was the most reported local reaction in all study groups. A dose and age 
dependent pattern were noted, where the highest frequency of all local reactions was observed among 
the participants 18-55 years of age that received Original/BA.4-5 60 µg and the lowest frequency of 
local reactions was among the participants aged >55 years of age that received Original/BA.4-5 30 µg.  
Among the participants aged 12-17 years of age 70% reported pain at injection site, the corresponding 
number for the age group 18-55 years was 81%. Most local reactions were mild to moderate at 
intensity, however, a higher frequency of moderate intensity was noted for pain at injection site in the 
youngest age group. 
Among the systemic events, fatigue (67-69%) and headache (40-46%) occurred at a similar frequency 
among all participants aged <55 years, and at lower frequency among participants >55 years.  
Fever was reported in 9% of the participants aged 12-17 years, and in 5% among the participants 
aged 18-55 years that received Original/BA.4-5 30µg. The highest frequency of fever (11-14%) was 
reported among the participants ≥18 years that received the highest dose of the bivalent vaccine.  
Most of the events were mild to moderate, it was however noted that a higher frequency of moderate 
was noted in the youngest age groups for fatigue, headache and muscle pain, where the older age 
group reported a higher number of mild events instead. 
AEs reported within 7 days after dose were overall related to reactogenicity. No severe or serious AEs 
occurred during that period. 
No post-marketing data for the bivalent Original/BA.4-5 vaccine have been submitted. 
Data on safety/reactogenicity from Study C4591048 substudy D, which includes 100 children aged 5-
<12 years, is awaited early 2023. 
Based on these results, overall, a dose- as well as age-depending difference was noted, where the 
participants aged >55 years tend to have a lower frequency of reactogenicity events and participants 
receiving a higher dose tend to have a higher frequency of reported events related to reactogenicity. 
This is in line with what has previously been observed for BNT162b2 vaccines. The reactogenicity 
profile for Original/BA.4-5 obtained in study C4591044 cohort 2, appears overall to be in line with the 
reactogenicity profile observed for bivalent Original/BA.1 and Original 30µg as studied in C4591031 
substudy D and E in participants aged ≥18 years. 
In studies previously evaluated (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077) for Original 10µg for children aged 5-<12 
years of age, the dose finding study included 10, 20 and 30µg. The dose 10µg was selected and 
further evaluated in phase 2/3 trials, in which the results supported 10µg to be a suitable dosing with 
an acceptable reactogenicity profile that did not diverge from the adult population. For the bivalent 
vaccine intended for use in children aged 5-<12 years of age, the selected dose for the updated 
Original/BA.4-5 is similar (5+5µg) to Original (10µg). Together with the presented reactogenicity data 
provided from participants aged ≥12 years who have received Original/BA.4-5 (15/15µg), it is 
considered unlikely that Original/BA.4-5 (5/5µg) would differ in reactogenicity.  
2.5.8.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the reactogenicity profile in participants >12 years of age who have received Original/BA.4-5 
(15/15µg) are in line with what can be anticipated from a vaccine with mostly mild to moderate

reaction. The suggested dose (5/5µg) is similar as for the for children aged 5-<12 years authorized 
Original 10µg, and it is considered unlikely that reactogenicity would differ. Data on reactogenicity 
from Study C4591048 substudy D, which includes 100 children aged 5-<12 years, is awaited early 
2023.

The objective of the study is 
to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, immunogenicity 
and efficacy of COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine. 
An imbalance between the 
vaccine and control groups in 
the frequency of COVID-19 
disease, in particular for 
severe COVID-19 disease, 
may indicate the occurrence 
of vaccine associated 
enhanced disease. 
Surveillance is planned for 2 
years following Dose 2. 
The purpose of the dose-
finding/selected-dose study 
is to rapidly describe the 
safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, and efficacy 
of the BNT162b2 RNA-based 
COVID-19 vaccine candidate 
against COVID-19 in healthy 
children. 
To assess the occurrence of 
safety events of interest, 
including myocarditis and 
pericarditis, among 
individuals in the general US 
population and in subcohorts 
of interest within selected 
data sources participating in 
the US Sentinel System.

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for 
dispersion for injection, EMEA/H/C/005735. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found 
acceptable. 
2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions  
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the 
flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines 
(EMA/689080/2020 rev.1, from 16 December 2020)5 document which aims at facilitating the 
preparedness work of COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing 
packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID19 
vaccines for EU citizens within the existing legal framework.  
Labelling exemptions 
Outer and immediate labelling (from start of supply to end March 2023). 
The following exemptions are temporarily agreed for the labelling. These exemptions are justified on 
the necessity to label batches ahead of time.  
Outer carton  
•  Strength: '5/5 micrograms per dose' (initially proposed)’, instead of '(5/5 micrograms)/dose' 
(agreed during evaluation with brackets). 
•  Common name/INN: common name ‘COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified)’ (initially 
proposed), instead of  common name ‘COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified)’ and INN 
‘tozinameran/riltozinameran'’ (during evaluation). 
•  Statement of the active substance: “One dose contains 5 micrograms tozinameran and 
5 micrograms mRNA encoding Omicron BA.4 and BA.5”, instead of “One dose contains 
5 micrograms tozinameran and 5 micrograms famtozinameran” (agreed during the 
assessment)”. 
• 
"(After dilution, each vial contains 10 doses of 0.2 mL.)" with text brackets (initially proposed) 
instead of "After dilution, each vial contains 10 doses of 0.2 mL."; agreed during evaluation 
(without brackets). 
•  MA number with ‘XXX’ placeholder, instead of MA number will be used after approval. 
Vial label 
•  Omission of the Common name/INN due to space limitation.

2.8.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
The updates of the QR code/URL to include further references to Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
(5/5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection, as well as the necessary layout 
changes on the website shall be submitted and assessed via an Article 61.3 notification (post-
authorisation). 
2.8.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, COMIRNATY (tozinameran) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as a new active substance and new biological.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
After emerging as a human pathogen causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has continuously evolved and 
appeared in several variants causing new waves of infection. The strain causing the latest waves of 
disease has been the Omicron, with several subvariants beginning with BA.1. Currently BA.5 is 
dominating in the EU. 
The sought indication is for booster use: 
“Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is 
indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in children aged 5 to 
11 years who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19 (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
While the efficacy of available vaccines emulating the Wuhan strain against severe disease due to 
Omicron appears largely retained, efficacy against symptomatic disease is obviously reduced. 
Moreover, the duration of protection with the original vaccine may be reduced given that the emerging 
variant is less sensitive than the original target. 
Bivalent variant mRNA vaccines containing the original strain as well as BA.1. and BA.4/5 were 
approved for boosting in the EU in September. SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been rapid, and as stated 
above the dominating variant at the present time is no longer BA.1 but BA.5.  
Currently available therapies have different benefit-risk considerations depending on the stage of 
illness and disease manifestations. While care for individuals who have COVID-19 has improved with 
clinical experience, vaccination is the most effective medical countermeasure to decrease risk and

mitigate spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the ongoing pandemic. At this stage, there is no 
approved COVID-19 vaccine including BA.4-5 for children aged 5-<12 years of age. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
No clinical studies including efficacy or immunogenicity were submitted in the current application 
concerning booster dose with Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5) micrograms/dose for the age group 5-
<12-year-old children. 
Safety data have been submitted from study C4591044 cohort 2 in which 503 participants ≥12 years 
received either Original/BA.4-5 30µg or 60µg. Furthermore reference is made to study C4591031 
Substudy D and E which included bivalent Original/BA.1 and was evaluated previously in 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0140. None of the studies include children aged 5-<12 years of age. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
It has been demonstrated that boosting with a bivalent Original/BA.1 vaccine confers increased 
immunogenicity against BA.1 compared to Original alone, as well as non-inferior immunogenicity to the 
original strain, while having the same total mRNA content. It is assumed that the same would be the 
case for the Original/BA.4-5 vaccine versus BA.4, BA.5 and the original virus. Data from 
immunogenicity studies in mice give some support for this notion. 
Booster dose of Original Comirnaty 10 µg has been demonstrated to be immunogenic in age group 5-
<12 year of old and therefore extrapolation of immunogenicity of a booster dose of Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 5/5 µg in this age group can be anticipated. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The size of any increment of immunogenicity against BA.4-5 compared to Comirnaty Original is not 
known. Moreover, since there is no immune correlate of protection, the extent of increased efficacy 
given a certain increment in immunogenicity, is also not known. The same pertains to the breadth of 
the immune response as well as the duration of protection. 
The former will be illustrated by immunogenicity data from study C4591044 for age group 12-17 years 
of age. Immunogenicity data from C4591048 for the age group between 5 – 11 years of age is also 
expected post-approval. 
Observational studies (“real life data”) are anticipated to inform on the effectiveness of Original/BA.4-
5. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
7-day post-dose safety data from study C4591044 cohort 2 including 503 participants ≥12 years of 
age to which Original/BA.4-5 30µg or 60µg was administered as a fourth dose, has been presented. 
Overall, the reactogenicity profile in these participants who received Original/BA.4-5 (15/15µg) are in 
line with what can be anticipated from a vaccine with mostly mild to moderate reaction. As slightly 
higher frequency of events related to reactogenicity was noted among the participants ≥18 years of 
age that received (30+30µg), and a trend to lower frequency of reactogenicity among subject >55 
years of age compared with adults aged 18-55 years. This is in line with data presented for the Original 
vaccine.

EMA/889536/2022

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are currently no data on the bivalent Original/BA.4-5 variant vaccine in children aged 5-<12 
years of age. Data on reactogenicity from Study C4591048 substudy D, which includes 100 children 
aged 5-<12 years, is awaited early 2023. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
While protection against severe disease remains high, the efficacy against any clinical disease of 
Comirnaty Original is lower against Omicron strains, compared to what was seen against Wuhan and 
the Alpha-Delta variants. At this stage, only vaccine based on the Wuhan strain are authorized for 
children aged 5-<12 years. 
There are no data available for Original/BA.4-5 (5/5µg) in participants aged 5-<12 years of age.  
It has been demonstrated that boosting with a bivalent Original/BA.1 vaccine confers increased 
immunogenicity against BA.1 compared to Original alone, as well as non-inferior immunogenicity to the 
original strain, while having the same total mRNA content. It is assumed that the same would be the 
case for the Original/BA.4-5 vaccine versus BA.4, BA.5 and the original virus. Data from 
immunogenicity studies in mice give some support for this notion. 
Reactogenicity data from 503 participants ≥12 years of age that have received Original/BA.4-5 15+15 
or 30+30 µg have been presented.  
In studies previously evaluated (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077) for Original 10µg for children aged 5-<12 
years of age, the dose finding study included 10, 20 and 30µg. The dose 10µg was selected and 
further evaluated in phase 2/3 trials, in which the results supported 10µg to be a suitable dosing with 
an acceptable reactogenicity profile that did not diverge from the adult population. For the bivalent 
vaccine intended for use in children aged 5-<12 years of age, the selected dose for the updated 
Original/BA.4-5 is similar (5+5µg) to Original (10µg). Together with the presented reactogenicity data 
provided from participants aged ≥12 years that have received Original/BA.4-5 (15/15µg), it is 
considered unlikely that Original/BA.4-5 (5/5µg) would differ in reactogenicity.  
Data on reactogenicity from Study C4591048 substudy D, which includes 100 children aged 5-<12 
years will receive Original/BA.4-5 (5/5µg) is awaited early 2023. The MAH has committed to providing 
safety and immunogenicity data from the ongoing C4591048 study in children 5-11 years of age.  
Overall, the reactogenicity profile in participants >12 years of age that have received Original/BA.4-5 
(15/15µg) are in line with what can be anticipated from a vaccine with mostly mild to moderate 
reaction. The suggested dose (5+5µg) is similar as for the for children aged 5-<12 years authorized 
Original 10µg, and it is considered unlikely that reactogenicity would differ. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk balance of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose for the sought 
indication “active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in children aged 5 to 11 
years who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19” is 
positive.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/889536/2022  
Page 37/38 
 
 
 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of COMIRNATY is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose is favourable in the 
following indication(s): 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is 
indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in children aged 5 to 
11 years who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19 (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1).  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for COMIRNATY 
subject to the following conditions:

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for brivaracetam, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A case series of five patients reported major increases in brivaracetam plasma levels (by 95% to 280%) 
during introduction of adjunctive cannabidiol therapy. The mechanism of interaction is not clear, but 
possibly through CYP2C19 inhibition. The clinical relevance of the interaction is uncertain. In view of 
these data, the PRAC agrees that the information should be reflected in the section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for brivaracetam the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing brivaracetam is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

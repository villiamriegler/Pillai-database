1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. submitted on 23 August 2013 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Cyramza, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 15 November 2012. 
Cyramza was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/1004 on 4 July 2012. CYRAMZA was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: treatment of gastric cancer. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Cyramza as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find 
medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Cyramza as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer or 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma after prior chemotherapy. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
ramucirumab was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the world and is a major cause of cancer-related 
death (Ferlay et al. 2010). There were approximately one million new cases of stomach cancer worldwide 
in 2008 (640,000 men, 348,000 women), with approximately 736,000 deaths (463,000 men, 273,000 
women), making it the third-leading cause of cancer death globally in men and the fifth in women (Ferlay 
et al. 2010). The ratio of men to women is about 2:1. Gastric cancer incidence varies markedly by 
geographic region. In the European Union (EU), incidence and mortality for gastric cancer were estimated 
at 80,626 cases and 57,654 deaths, respectively, for 2012 (Steliarova-Foucher et al. 2012).  
The 5-year survival rate for gastric cancer, regardless of stage at diagnosis, is 24% and the prognosis for 
patients diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer is approximately 1 year median survival (Winer et al. 
2009; Price et al. 2012). 
More than half of gastric adenocarcinomas are diagnosed at an advanced stage (locally advanced or 
metastatic) when resection is not possible, as the disease is typically asymptomatic in early stages (Fuchs 
and Mayer 1995). Disease-related symptoms, which are extensive and severe in advanced gastric cancer, 
include the following: fatigue, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, anorexia, pain after eating, 
dysphagia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation, melena, hematemesis, weight loss, anaemia, and 
concomitant nutritional problems (Eckardt et al. 1990; Wanebo et al. 1993; Everett and Axon 1997; 
DeVita et al. 2008; American Cancer Society 2011; Cervantes et al. 2013). 
Surgical resection is the only treatment modality that is potentially curative, though a large proportion of 
patients still relapse following resection and therefore combined modality approaches are standard for ≥
stage 1B disease.  
Chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease includes combination chemotherapy with 
cisplatin and fluropyrimidines or other chemotherapy agents including docetaxel, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, 
epirubicin, paclitaxel, irinotecan or mytomicin. Two-drug cytotoxic regimens are preferred because of 
lower toxicity. Three-drug regimens are reserved for medically fit patients with good performance status. 
One of the dosings and schedules of paclitaxel as single agent is 80 mg/m2 IV  on days 1, 2, 15 cycled 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 8/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
every 28 days (Hironaka et al., 2013). Trastuzumab can be added to chemotherapy for HER2-neu 
overexpressing adenocarcinoma (Bang et al., 2010). 
VEGF Receptor 2 is the key mediator of VEGF induced angiogenesis. Ramucirumab is a human 
receptor-targeted antibody that specifically binds to VEGF Receptor 2 and blocks binding of VEGF-A, 
VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. As a result, ramucirumab inhibits ligand stimulated activation of VEGF Receptor 2 
and its downstream signalling components, including p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases, 
neutralizing ligand-induced proliferation and migration of human endothelial cells (SmPC, section 5.1; 
see Non-clinical aspects). 
The applicant applied for a marketing authorisation for the following indication: Cyramza as a single agent 
is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma after prior chemotherapy. 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is: Cyramza in combination with paclitaxel is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma with disease progression after prior platinum and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (see 
section 5.1).  
Cyramza monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastric cancer or 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with disease progression after prior platinum or 
fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy, for whom treatment in combination with paclitaxel is not appropriate 
(see section 5.1).  
Ramucirumab therapy must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology (see 
SmPC, section 4.2). Cyramza is administered as an intravenous infusion over approximately 60 minutes. 
It should not be administered as an intravenous bolus or push. To achieve the required infusion duration 
of approximately 60 minutes, the maximum infusion rate of 25 mg/minute should not be exceeded, 
instead the infusion duration should be increased. The patient should be monitored during infusion for 
signs of infusion-related reactions (see SmPC, section 4.4) and the availability of appropriate 
resuscitation equipment should be ensured. 
The recommended dose of ramucirumab as a single agent is 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks.   
The recommended dose of ramucirumab is 8 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, prior to paclitaxel 
infusion. The recommended dose of paclitaxel is 80 mg/m2 administered by intravenous infusion over 
approximately 60 minutes on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The drug substance of Cyramza is ramucirumab, a recombinant, human (IgG1) monoclonal antibody 
produced in a stably transfected NS0 mouse myeloma cell line. Ramucirumab binds specifically to the 
extracellular domain of the human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) inhibiting 
VEGF-stimulated activation of VEGFR-2 and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases, and neutralizing 
VEGF-induced mitogenesis of human endothelial cells. Ramucirumab does not involve Fc-region effector 
functions as a part of its mode of action. Cyramza is proposed for the treatment of patients with gastric 
cancer. Sterile 10 mg/ml solution of Cyramza is provided in Type I glass vials and diluted with 0.9% 
sodium chloride prior to i.v. injection.  Cyramza is subject to medical prescription and administered to 
patients in a hospital or outpatient setting by a medical professional. The proposed shelf-life is 36 months 
at 2°C - 8°C.

Schematic of Ramucirumab 
Ramucirumab drug substance (DS) is a clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to slightly yellow liquid 
with pH 5.7 - 6.3. Ramucirumab is typical IgG1 molecule consisting of two κ -light chains (LC) and two 
γ1-heavy chains (HC). Each HC and LC contains 446 and 214 amino acids, respectively. The molecule has 
16 disulfide bonds and two N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn296 of HC, no O-linked glycosylation has 
been observed. The molecular weight of glycosylated ramucirumab is 146756 Da.  
The Applicant’s claim that Ramucirumab is a new active substance (NAS) has been accepted since 
ramucirumab comprises a ‘substance not previously authorised, i.e.  a monoclonal antibody which is 
manufactured through rDNA technology with a novel amino acid sequence. Since the product comprises 
a novel amino acid sequence, the CHMP has accepted the NAS claim.   
Manufacture 
Manufacture and control facilities for ramucirumab DS have been listed and an adequate overview of the 
DS manufacturing process at ImClone Systems LLC; 33 ImClone Drive; Branchburg, NJ 08876 USA has 
been provided.

Cell Culture  
Ramucirumab is produced in a fed-batch process using an NS0 cell line.  The cell culture process involves 
three stages: (1) the seed train, (2) the inoculum train, and (3) the production stage.  Following the 
production stage the cell culture fluid containing ramucirumab is separated from the cells by 
centrifugation and filtered.  The resulting cell culture filtrate is then further purified (see below). 
Cell culture and in-process controls (IPC) have been sufficiently described and are considered 
appropriate. 
Purification process 
The purification process consists of a series of chromatography, viral inactivation and filtration and 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps. 
Each step of the purification process has been adequately described, including description of the different 
buffers used, column regeneration, and storage conditions of both columns and product after each step.  
Suitable IPCs are in place, with acceptable limits. 
Control of materials 
Ramucirumab is expressed from a NS0 (mouse) cell line. The expression plasmids and NS0 cell line 
source, history, generation as well as testing of the cell banks (accession cell bank (ACB), master cell 
bank (MCB), and the preparation of the working cell bank (WCB)) including methods and reagents used 
during cell culture and storage conditions have been described in detail following the principles in 
respective guidelines (ICH Q5B, Q5A and Q5D). Absence of adventitious agents has been sufficiently 
established. Genetic stability is extensively demonstrated.  
Other raw materials are described and in general, appropriate information on raw materials is submitted.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
This submission does not use a quality by design (QbD) approach; the manufacturing process 
development is based on a traditional approach which incorporates state of the art methods for 
investigation and classification of critical parameters.  
In general, the procedure for classification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process 
parameters (CPPs) is deemed acceptable. The approach is described in detail; it is noted that it is aimed 
at identifying process parameters (PPs) which have a probable risk of impacting a CQA; these were 
included in preliminary design of experiments (DoEs) investigations. Experimental studies on selected 
parameters, for each unit operation, having potential to impact on CQAs were then performed using 
scale-down models to determine the process parameter criticality and to define the PARs.  
The general approach of the Applicant was found appropriate. However, a number of factors were not 
sufficiently investigated, and gave rise to specific remarks mainly related to the effects on process 
parameters on impurity removal. Upon request, (additional) CPPs/cIPCs were set.  The Applicant’s 
strategy is now acceptable. 
Process validation and/or evaluation  
Data have been presented for full-scale validation lots including results for all routine CPPs, CIPCs, and 
release tests. In addition, additional (non-routine) data have been presented for impurity removal and 
storage of intermediates.  
Validation was performed in a traditional fashion; all validation lots were manufactured ‘at-target’, i.e. 
with PPs at the intended set point. The data provided sufficiently demonstrate that under these 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 11/102 
 
 
 
  
 
conditions, the process is highly consistent and able to deliver a Drug Substance which complies with 
specifications.  
The clearance of process related impurities was evaluated at selected process steps in the bulk drug 
substance manufacturing process. In conclusion, the validation exercise is deemed satisfactory. 
Characterisation 
Ramucirumab is a recombinant human mAb of IgG1 subclass with one Fc glycosylation site on Asn296N. 
Ramucirumab specifically binds to the extracellular domain of the human VEGFR2/KDR. The Applicant has 
characterised the primary, secondary and higher order structure, post-translational modifications, 
glycosylation, charged isoforms, purity and biological activity associated with ramucirumab with a range 
of methodologies. 
The primary structure of ramucirumab was elucidated using techniques including amino acid analysis, 
N-terminal and C-terminal sequencing and LC-MS/MS peptide mapping.  Amino acid analysis yielded an 
amino acid composition that was consistent with the theoretical composition.  The N-terminal and 
C-terminal sequencing results were consistent with expected data. Data obtained by LC-MS/MS peptide 
mapping accounted for 100% of the expected amino acid sequence for both the heavy chain and the light 
chain. Furthermore sulfhydryl groups, disulphide bridges and free thiols have been determined.  
The higher order structure and conformational stability of ramucirumab was determined by using a 
variety of biophysical methods.  Ramucirumab has a predominantly β-sheet structure, which is consistent 
with the typical folded IgG structure, and has a higher order tertiary structure which is also consistent 
with mAbs.  The disulphide bond structure in ramucirumab was confirmed. The studies demonstrated 
expected results for a monoclonal antibody.  Data have been provided to show that ramucirumab is 
predominantly monomeric under the formulation conditions and thermal stability investigations also 
indicated the presence of a folded structure. 
The carbohydrate composition and charge heterogeneity of ramucirumab drug substance has been 
thoroughly examined and there is no O-linked glycosylation present in ramucirumab as expected for IgG.   
The biological activity of ramucirumab i.e. binding to the Kinetic Domain Region (KDR) has been 
demonstrated. The mechanism of action for ramucirumab does not involve effector functions.  
The active substance specification includes methods to evaluate Purity, Identity, Protein Concentration 
and Potency. 
The specifications follow the present guidelines and Ph. Eur monoclonal antibodies for human use 
(01/2012:2031). The proposed acceptance criteria have been established on the basis of batches 
manufactured throughout development, used in clinical and non-clinical studies, manufacturing 
experience, analytical variability, the stability of the DS at the recommended storage condition, and 
regulatory guidance.   
Impurities  
Potential product-related impurities may arise from the degradation of the molecule that may occur 
during routine manufacturing, processing, and storage. Two orthogonal methods are used to detect and 
quantify changes in the purity of ramucirumab drug substance. Process-related impurities have been 
identified and justified in the dossier, including DNA, HCP and other impurities. 
The validation studies of analytical tests used for specifications were performed according to ICH Q2.  
Potency assays 
Two potency assays have been described. Appropriate system suitability criteria are defined and the 
method has been extensively validated.

Batch analysis and justification of specification  
The batch analytical data for all manufactured batches have been provided. The provided results indicate 
that the manufacturing process is under control. Overall batch analysis results for the commercial scale 
Process C1 and C0 batches appear consistent and are highly similar. The Applicant has supported the 
proposed quantitative specification limits with batch analysis data and a statistical reasoning. The 
specifications are deemed acceptable.  
Container closure system  
Extensive information is provided regarding the bags and the closure system. This includes technical 
drawings and information on extractables, leachables, sterilisation by gamma-irradiation and stability.  
Stability 
The analytical methods used for assessing stability are a subset of DS batch release test methods and can 
be considered stability indicating and acceptable. The methods are able to detect changes of the DS 
colour, clarity, pH, osmolality, quantity, potency, purity, charge heterogeneity, endotoxins and 
bioburden. The applied acceptance limits were based on specifications at the time of testing. The studies 
follow the guidelines ICH Q5C, Q1A, Q1B and Q1E. 
A storage period of 24 months at 2 – 8 ˚C is proposed. The Applicant has conducted real-time, 
real-condition stability studies (2-8ºC), as well as studies under accelerated (23 - 27°C) and stressed 
conditions (38 - 42°C).  
The claimed storage period of 24 months is mainly supported by the extensive primary stability studies 
and supporting studies from commercial scale clinical lots.  
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable in the proposed container. In conclusion, the claim for a storage period of 24 months is 
acceptable. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
Ramucirumab DS has been manufactured using four processes (Process A, B, C0 and C1). The 
manufacturing process has been scaled up during development to the commercial scale process (Process 
C0/C1). Process A DS was used for Phase 1 trials, Process B and Process C0 materials were utilized in 
Phase 2 studies and early Phase 3 studies. Process C0 material was used in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical 
studies.  All changes during development have been adequately described and mainly relate to more 
optimal process control and improvement of viral clearance. 
A comprehensive comparability exercise was performed to justify the introduced changes into the 
manufacturing process during development. Assessment of the comparability between DS produced by 
the four processes is based on characterization data, batch release data and additional biochemical 
characterization. A comparability exercise was performed for Process A and Process B, Process B and 
Process C0 and finally Process C0 and Process C1 to demonstrate active substance of comparable quality. 
Additional characterization performed for Process A, B and C0 drug substance demonstrated that the DS 
has remained highly similar throughout the process changes.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description and composition of the Drug Product 
Ramucirumab, Concentrate Solution for Infusion, 10 mg/mL, is a sterile, single-use solution, The 
ramucirumab drug product is formulated in an aqueous buffered solution at pH 6.0, containing 10 mM 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 13/102 
 
 
  
 
histidine buffer, 75 mM sodium chloride, 133 mM glycine (all isotonicity agents), and 0.01% w/v 
polysorbate 80 (as a stabiliser).  All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. No novel excipients are used and the excipients are not of 
human or animal origin.  
Ramucirumab drug product is supplied in two presentations, 100 mg/10 mL and 500 mg/50 mL, in 14 mL 
or 50 mL vials respectively, to be stored at 2-8 °C. The vials are stoppered with rubber stoppers sealed 
with aluminium seals with a plastic flip-off cap. The drug product is diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride 
injection (normal saline) in an infusion bag prior to administration by intravenous infusion.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The DP manufacturing process is a dilution of drug substance with a formulation buffer identical to the 
drug substance formulation. There is no overage for Ramucirumab drug product. The development of the 
DP manufacturing process consists of changes in manufacturing site, filling technology, container closure 
system and scale. This is sufficiently described.  
The development of the process parameter control strategy is described. Process parameter ranges are 
justified mainly based on historical data (including process data from manufacturing of clinical batches 
and platform knowledge). For specific parameters, additional commercial scale development studies have 
been completed in order to verify the control strategy. 
An additional vial presentation was introduced and both the 10 mL and 50 mL presentations were filled 
into new primary packaging components. The primary packaging component changes comprise a change 
from moulded to tubing Type 1 glass vials, and the introduction of a new stopper of similar composition 
to the existing stopper. Studies were conducted to justify the changes.  
Validation of the manufacturing processes was successfully completed. Comparability has been 
demonstrated.  
Container closure integrity studies have been conducted and the effects of mechanical (shear) stress on 
ramucirumab have been evaluated. A toxicology assessment of potential leachables was also performed.  
The results demonstrate that ramucirumab DP is stable in the proposed container- closure system. 
Adventitious agents 
Bovine serum albumin is the only raw material of animal origin that is used in the cell culture medium of 
the ramucirumab manufacturing process. The country of origin of BSA is New Zealand which is free from 
TSE therefore the risk of TSE contamination from the raw materials is considered negligible. 
MCB and WCB have been adequately characterised for the presence of endogenous and adventitious 
agents (microbial and viral contaminants). Retrovirus particles (A- and C-type) have been identified, as 
expected for the NS0 cell line. Cells at the limit of in vitro cell age have been characterised for the 
presence of adventitious agents. Viral clearance steps of the manufacturing process have been 
demonstrated to be able to remove possible viral contaminants.  
Viral Clearance Studies 
Viral clearance challenge studies were performed for the different orthogonal viral reduction unit 
operations using various model viruses. The choice of steps and viruses to be validated for their virus 
removal capacity is deemed acceptable. Appropriate scaled-down models were developed and worst-case 
parameters were identified.  An assessment of the virus risk potential using the viral clearance data for 
the commercial purification process has been submitted. The data from the viral clearance studies to 
support marketing authorization are robust. These cover an adequate range of properties, including size, 
genome content, as well as resistance to low pH inactivation treatment. The results from the viral 
clearance studies and calculated viral risk safety margin for ramucirumab commercial process as well as 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 14/102 
 
 
  
 
the historical ramucirumab processes, demonstrate that there is an appropriate viral clearance control 
strategy for ramucirumab bulk drug substance. The data support that the process is sufficiently validated 
for its ability to remove/inactivate viruses. 
Manufacture of the product 
Ramucirumab DP is manufactured as a sterile, non-pyrogenic solution at a concentration of 10 mg/mL 
and aseptically filled into vials. The DP manufacturing process consists of dilution of the bulk drug 
substance in histidine buffer containing sodium chloride, glycine, and polysorbate 80. The DP solution is 
sterile filtered and aseptically filled into depyrogenated Type I tubing glass vials (500 mg/50 mL or 100 
mg/10 mL), stoppered with sterile stoppers and crimp sealed. No reprocessing is performed. Operating 
ranges for process parameters and acceptance criteria for controls have been provided. The process 
validation (PV) studies were executed at the proposed commercial manufacturing sites, according to the 
commercial scale and processes described. Overall the process validation has been appropriately 
described. 
The overall approach of the PV activities encompassed three stages: (1) Process Design (2) Process 
Qualification, and (3) Continuous Process Verification, using a science and risk based approach and 
covered validation of the manufacturing process including the sterilisation process.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this product. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of product and includes 
tests for Purity, Identity, Potency and Protein Concentration.  
No new impurities have been identified for the drug product. Additional tests for Polysorbate 80, Sterility, 
Particulate Matter, Container Closure Integrity and Volume in Container have been included in the DP 
specifications.   
Batch Analyses 
Batch analytical data have been provided for DP lots manufactured from Process C1 DS, Process C0, 
Process B and Process A. Ramucirumab DP batches (Process A, B and C0) manufactured for use in clinical 
studies have been submitted. The C1 batches were used in consistency, stability and comparability 
studies. The analytical batch release results across the DP batches of Process C1, C0, B and A as well as 
DP versus DS are within the specification limits, consistent and highly similar. Comparability of Process C1 
material filled at commercial manufacturing sites has been demonstrated. Batch analysis results have 
confirmed the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Reference standards 
In house reference standards are used in analytical quality assays. DS batches manufactured by 
Processes A, C0 and C1 were used as reference standards throughout the development of ramucirumab. 
The same reference standards are used for DS and DP, this is considered justified. The formulation of the 
standards reflects the formulation changes in the processes The one-tiered system will be replaced with 
a two-tiered RS system that is stored frozen as Primary and Secondary RS (-80°C to -70°C). The 
secondary frozen RS batch will be the ‘working RS’ used for routine release, stability and characterization 
testing of ramucirumab. This is acceptable.  
Container closure system

Ramucirumab drug product is packaged in a Type I tubing glass vial with a rubber stopper and an 
aluminium seal with a plastic flip-top. The drug product presentations are referred to as 500mg/50mL and 
100mg/10mL.  
Stability of the product 
Primary stability studies are ongoing for full scale DP lots manufactured at the two proposed commercial 
DP manufacturing sites (both using Process C1 DS). Primary stability data of 21 months for most of the DP 
lots are available at the recommended (2-8°C) storage conditions (18 months for the remaining two lots). 
Twelve month data for these lots are also available under accelerated (23-27°C) conditions and six month 
data  under stressed (38-42°C) storage conditions. The primary stability lots will continue to be evaluated 
at the recommended storage condition (2-8°C) up to 36 months according to the stability protocol. 
In addition, supportive stability data have been provided and this includes five lots of drug product 
manufactured using Process C0 drug substance, for which data have been provided through 36 months. 
These Process C0 lots were within the proposed acceptance criteria for 36 months. At the recommended 
storage at 2-8°C there is no obvious trend for any parameter purity tests. Data from storage under 
accelerated (23-27°C) storage conditions and from a freeze thaw study and photostability data have also 
been presented. The secondary packaging provides adequate protection for ramucirumab DP against 
light. Freeze thaw study data show that temperature cycling does not adversely affect drug product 
stability. 
Analytical methods used for stability studies are the same as those used for release testing of the drug 
product. In addition IEF testing has been continued for stability testing.  At the recommended storage at 
2-8°C there is no obvious trend for any parameter including SE-HPLC and SDS-PAGE. A shelf life of 36 
months at 2-8°C is acceptable.  
For administration, ramucirumab DP is diluted into 0.9% sodium chloride injection and administered via 
peripheral IV infusion. The stability of prepared ramucirumab dosing solutions was evaluated using 
commonly available infusion containers and infusion sets. In addition, a microbiological challenge study 
was performed to evaluate microbial growth promoting activity of ramucirumab dosing solution stored at 
20–25°C.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Drug substance 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls  
The procedure for classification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs) 
are acceptable and questions on impurity removal, especially process related impurities, were addressed 
during assessment. Established CQAs are similar to those for other monoclonal antibodies. 
The manufacturing process, its description, and the associated control strategy are deemed acceptable, 
after the Applicant provided clarification and made several (mostly minor) amendments, particularly 
regarding the robustness of impurity removal.   
Batch analysis and justification of specification  
The Applicant amended its original approach upon request and submitted a completely new justification 
of specification. This resulted in the introduction of separate release and shelf life limits for several 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 16/102 
 
 
  
 
quantitative parameters and amendments to the limits themselves. Finally, the Applicant committed to 
introduce a more quantitative purity method post-approval. This will improve the current control 
strategy, which is itself satisfactory for the purposes of approval. All specifications are now properly 
justified. 
Drug product 
Reference standards  
The Applicant sufficiently addressed the issue of potency drift of the standards and justified that more 
robust strategies have been implemented with each successive manufacturing campaign. Since RS 
specifications/acceptance criteria are aligned with the current DS release criteria, a commitment was 
requested from the Applicant to update the specifications/acceptance criteria for the primary and working 
reference standards should the drug substance specifications be updated in the future.   
Adventitious agents’ safety evaluation 
Upon final clarification, the data support that the materials (MCB, WCBs etc.) are tested and qualified, 
that the process is sufficiently validated for its ability to remove/inactivate viruses and that the viral 
safety of the product is assured. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The CTD is of appropriate quality and provides a satisfactory description of the 
characterisation, manufacture and control of drug substance and drug product. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The Applicant will introduce a more quantitative purity method for the drug substance.  
The Applicant will update the specifications/acceptance criteria for the primary and working reference 
standards should the drug substance specifications be updated in the future.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical studies were conducted in accordance with current international regulatory guidelines 
relevant to therapeutic development (ICH S6, ICH S9, ICH M3).  
The pivotal toxicology studies were performed in compliance with the principles of Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP). Toxicokinetic and immunogenicity analyses as well as immunophenotyping in the two 
pivotal Cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies were not formally GLP-compliant.  
Scientific advice has not been sought for the non-clinical aspects of ramucirumab development.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A series of in vitro and in vivo studies were carried out for the biochemical characterisation of 
ramucirumab. Since ramucirumab is not cross-reactive in mouse, its antitumour activity and 
antiangiogenic mechanism of action could not be studied in these species. A rat-anti mouse flk-1 
monoclonal IgG1 antibody, DC101, was developed for use in in vivo studies. 
The key biochemical and pharmacodynamic characteristics of ramucirumab are summarised in Table 1.

The in vitro binding assays showed that ramucirumab binds with high affinity to human VEGFR-2 (Kd ~ 5 
× 10-11M and EC50=0.16 nM obtained from an ELISA assay) and it inhibits VEGFR-2 binding to its ligand 
VEGF-A with an IC50 of ~0.8 nM. Competitive blocking assays showed that anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies 
effectively inhibited 125I-VEGF binding to HUVEC-expressed VEGFR-2. Furthermore, it was shown that 
ramucirumab is highly specific for human VEGFR-2 and does not cross-react with the related receptors 
VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-3, or other growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases.    
The results of competitive blocking by three different anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies of radiolabeled VEGF 
binding to VEGFR-2 expressed in HUVECs (Zhu et al. 2003) showed that ramucirumab inhibited 
VEGF-induced mitogenesis with an ED50 ≈ 0.7 nM, in comparison to that of 1.5 nM for the other two 
antibodies (IMC-1C11 and IMC-2C6) tested. In addition, ramucirumab and other anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies 
(IMC-1C11, IMC-2C6) inhibited VEGF-induced migration of HL60 and HEL cells expressing VEGFR-2 in a 
dose-dependent manner, but it did not inhibit migration of U937 cells that do not express VEGFR-2.  
VEGF stimulation resulted in significant VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in both HUVEC and PAE-KDR cells. 
However, in the presence of VEGF, ramucirumab antagonized the VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in a 
dose-dependent manner. Ramucirumab was a more potent inhibitor of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation than the 
parent antibody IMC-2C6 (>5- to 25-fold) in both cell-based assays. 
The binding inhibition of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGF-D to human VEGFR-2 by ramucirumab was assessed 
in an in vitro (cell-free) model (Report IMC04). Ramucirumab inhibited the binding of VEGF-A (IC50 = 2.3 
nM), VEGF-C (IC50 = 0.7 nM), and VEGF-D (IC50 = 0.3 nM) to soluble extracellular domain of human 
VEGFR-2 in a dose-depended manner.  
Functionally, ramucirumab blocks VEGF-A-stimulated activation of VEGFR-2, and inhibits 
VEGF-A-induced migration of endothelial cells and human leukemia cells. Additional evidence in the 
literature has shown that it also blocks the interaction of other VEGFR-2 ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D with 
VEGFR-2 receptor (Lu et al, 2003; Jimenez et al. 2005; Goldman et al. 2007; Tvorogov et al. 2010). 
Ramucirumab is also capable of inhibiting VEGF-C-induced activation of VEGFR-2, and blocking 
VEGF-C-induced hetero-dimerization of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 (Nillson et al. 2010). Ramucirumab also 
inhibits sprouting and proliferation of endothelial cells following stimulation with VEGF-C (Miao et al. 
2006; Tvorogov et al. 2010; Goldman et al. 2007). 
Experiments with primary human aortic endothelial cells and dermal microvascular endothelial cells 
showed that ramucirumab can induce downregulation of surface VEGFR-2. The effect is 
concentration-dependent with optimum endocytosis occurring at 25 nM (Report IMC02). Ramucirumab 
recognises human VEGFR-2, but does not recognise mouse VEGFR-2 (Flk1). Therefore, a rat surrogate 
antibody DC101 was used in proof-of-concept studies in human cancer xenograft models in mice. The 
characterisation data of DC101 surrogate antibody showed that DC101 is specific for murine VEGFR-2 and 
did not bind to human VEGFR-2 or mouse VEGFR-1. DC101 binds to murine VEGFR-2 with a 10-fold lower 
binding affinity than ramucirumab to the human receptor. Similarly to humans it blocks VEGFR-2 
signalling in vitro. Functionally, DC101 inhibited VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of mouse VEGFR-2. 
In vitro experiments were conducted using both direct binding ELISA and BIACore analyses to assess the 
binding of DC101 and ramucirumab to mouse and human VEGFR2 (Report 1001-09). Ramucirumab, but 
not DC101, bound to immobilized human VEGFR-2 (KDR) with an EC50 of 0.16nM. Conversely, only 
DC101, but not ramucirumab, bound to mouse VEGFR-2 (Flk-1) with EC50 = 0.28 nM. Endothelial cell 
apoptosis is induced in mouse metastatic tumour xenograft models upon treatment with DC101 and 
precedes initiation of tumour cell apoptosis by about 1 week (Sweeney et al. 2002; Bruns et al. 2000). 
Several studies using different imaging modalities such as Doppler ultrasound (Franco et al. 2006; Krix et 
al. 2003; Jugold et al. 2008; Cheung et al. 2007), dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (DCE-CT) (Stantz et al. 
2011; Cheung et al. 2007), and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MRI) (Kiessling et 
al. 2004) showed that reduction in tumour microvascular density and subsequent tumour growth 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 20/102 
 
 
  
 
inhibition upon treatment with DC101 correlate with functional reduction in blood flow in living, tumour 
bearing mice.   
Non-invasive measurements of tumour oxygenation in tumours grown in transparent skin-fold chambers 
showed induction of hypoxia and tumour vessel regression upon administration of DC101 
(Hansen-Algenstaedt et al. 2001). Induction of tumour hypoxia has also been shown in several tumour 
models by the uptake of Hypoxyprobe (pimonidazole) which homes to hypoxic tissues in living animals 
and is subsequently detected immunohistochemically (Paez-Ribes et al. 2009; Franco et al. 2006).  
Characterization of the mechanism of the anti-angiogenic effects of ramucirumab in rodent was shown in 
one study (Report IMC03). Purified human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and ADSC (adipose derived 
stem cells) were mixed with matrigel and implanted under the skin of mice. The EPC and ADSC form 
branching endothelial cords within the matrigel matrix. The endothelial cords appear to form a functional 
capillary network that anastomoses with the dermal vasculature of the mouse, as evidenced by perfusion 
of the matrigel plug with erythrocytes. The formation of the human capillary network within the plugs was 
inhibited in mice when ramucirumab was administered at 10 mg/kg every 3 days for the duration of the 
experiment. 
Proof of concept was shown in a human gastric cancer xenograft model in mice where DC101 exhibited a 
significant tumour growth inhibitory effect as measured by >50 % inhibition of tumour growth (Report 
2212-03).  
DC101 efficacy was tested in several other human cancer (hepatic, colorectal, breast, non-small cell and 
leakemia) xenograft models in mice. Based on the results, in most of these studies, DC101 as 
monotherapy and in combination with approved chemotherapies inhibited tumour growth. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies of ramucirumab have been conducted (see discussion on 
non-clinical aspects). However several cell-based assays have been conducted by the applicant in order to 
determine if ramucirumab is capable of triggering complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity and 
to evaluate the potential of ramucirumab to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC) activity.  Neither CDC nor ADCC functions were observed with ramucirumab in these assays (data 
not shown). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies have been performed with ramucirumab but safety 
pharmacology parameters were assessed as part of the GLP-compliant 5-and 39-week toxicology studies 
in Cynomolgus monkeys.  
In these studies, no treatment-related effects were evident upon physical examination, or on 
assessments of blood pressure, ECG, and rectal body temperature. No specific examination or data 
collection was performed on the respiratory or central nervous system, but no effects were noted on these 
systems post-dosing during physical examinations. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

2.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of ramucirumab were characterised in 2 repeat-dose toxicology 
studies after a single dose and multiple doses in monkeys, after a single dose in a monkey wound-healing 
study and in a single dose comparability study in monkeys.  A pharmacokinetic study of the rodent 
anti-VEGFR-2 surrogate for ramucirumab antibody, DC101, was conducted in mice to estimate plasma 
concentrations associated with the regimen planned to be used in mouse efficacy studies of DC101.

b The bioanalytical, pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity data and analyses are submitted as a standalone report 
SSR04014. This report will be referenced as Report SNBL023.04-SSR04014. 
PK/TK evaluations of ramucirumab were conducted as part of the 5-week (4-dose) (Report SNBL 
023.04-SSR04014) and 39-week (Report 1163-110) intravenous repeat dose toxicity studies in 
Cynomolgus monkeys. Ramucirumab was administered intravenously (i.v.) as either a slow bolus in the 
5-week study, or an approximate 10 minute i.v. infusion in the 39-week study. Doses were administered 
once weekly, except in the 5-week study in which a 2-week interval was allotted between Days 1 and 15 
to enable capture of the terminal elimination phase following the first ramucirumab treatment. 
Non-compartmental analysis of the concentration versus time data in the repeat-dose toxicity studies 
indicated that the PK behaviour of ramucirumab was non-linear over the 4 to 50 mg/kg test dose range. 
The mean AUC0-∞ increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner. The mean serum elimination 
half-life (t1/2) for ramucirumab increased, and clearance (CL) decreased with increasing dose on Study 
Day 1. Samples were also analysed for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to assess their impact on serum 
concentrations of ramucirumab. In the 5-week study, ADA were detected in mainly the low and mid-dose 
groups. ADA were detected in only 1/6 evaluable animals in the high-dose group. In the 39-weeks study, 
the highest incidence of ADA was found in the lowest dose group; ADA were not detected in any animals 
of the 50-mg/kg dose group. 
A PK study was conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys to assess the comparability of materials manufactured 
by two different processes (Report BDZ00030). Drug product from these two processes was formulated in 
the same histidine-based formulation buffer system, but at different antibody concentrations. Process B 
material was formulated at a concentration of 5.3 mg/mL, and was used in early clinical development. 
Process C material (also referred to as Process C0) was formulated at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, and 
was used in Phase 3 clinical trials. A total of 40 experimentally-naïve Cynomolgus monkeys (20 males, 20 
females) were assigned to the dose groups. No significant differences were evident in the PK of

ramucirumab manufactured by either Process B or C0. To confirm the PK comparability between the 
Process B and Process C materials, a comparative analysis using average bioequivalence criteria was 
conducted using all 20 animals in each group. Process B and Process C were considered comparable if for 
both Cmax and AUC0-∞ the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio of each process was 
within the bounds (80%, 125%). For Cmax, the geometric mean ratio was 103.2 and the 90% confidence 
interval was (91.4, 116.5). Similarly, for AUC0-∞, the geometric mean ratio was 101.8 and the 90% 
confidence interval was (92.0, 112.7). Based on these results and according to the criteria applied, there 
were no differences in the PK of ramucirumab manufactured by Process B and C. All animals were 
evaluated for the presence of ADAs against ramucirumab. The majority of the animals were negative for 
ADA at the Day 1 pre-dose time point. By Day 14, the majority of animals were positive for ADA, 
irrespective of whether Process B or C0 was given. An assessment of the impact of ADA on circulating 
ramucirumab concentrations is limited by the high incidence of ADA in each treatment group, but no clear 
indication that ADA decreased circulating ramucirumab concentrations was inferred from the data. 
The PK of ramucirumab was determined after a single 10 minute i.v. infusion of ramucirumab dose of 5, 
15, or 50 mg/kg in a wound-healing study in male Cynomolgus monkeys (n = 4)  to enable correlation of 
serum ramucirumab exposures with any adverse impact of ramucirumab on wound-healing (Report 
20018776). Serum concentrations were determined over the entire study observation period up to 3 
weeks (504 hours) post-dosing. Systemic exposure to ramucirumab increased with increasing dose 
levels. The serum elimination half-life (t1/2) ranged from 41.4 to 94.0 hours in the 5- and 15-mg/kg 
groups and from 131 to 176 in the 50-mg/kg group. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) range was 
in the range of plasma volume for monkeys. 
The PK of DC101 was characterised in naïve non-tumour bearing female nude mice treated by i.p. 
injection with an approximate dose of 40 mg/kg of DC101 (Report 2034-03). At baseline or 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 
8, 24, 48, and 72 hours following DC101 treatment, plasma was collected from three mice per group for 
DC101 concentration analysis by ELISA. After about the third treatment the mice will be in steady state 
and the AUC during the first 48 hours after a dose will be about 1.5 times higher in steady state than after 
the first treatment. The estimated terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) for DC101 according to this model 
was 29 hours. 
2.3.2.  Toxicology

Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies have been conducted. However local tolerance was investigated in 
the two pivotal repeat-dose toxicity evaluations in Cynomolgus monkeys by clinical observations, and as 
part of the histopathological evaluations (Report SNBL-023-04, Report 1163-110). Inflammatory 
reactions were observed at the majority of injection sites consisting of mononuclear cells or mononuclear 
and polymorphonuclear cells in perivascular areas in both control and treated groups in the 5-weeks 
repeat dose toxicity study.   
Other toxicity studies 
The anticipated mechanism-based impairment of wound-healing by ramucirumab was assessed in an 
incisional model of wound healing after administration of a single i.v. dose at 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg in 
Cynomolgus monkeys (Report 20018776). Serum concentrations of ramucirumab were determined to 
characterise the exposure to response relationship for wound-healing impairment. Samples of 
full-thickness punch biopsies of the skin and subcutaneous tissue were collected on Days 4, 8, 15, and 22 
for histopathology.  By Day 8, most incisions were closed at the surface and all incisions remained closed 
at Day 15 and Day 22.  
To characterise the tissue binding profile of ramucirumab and to confirm the relevance of the animal 
model (based on target distribution) used for the ramucirumab safety assessment, a comprehensive 
tissue cross-reactivity study was conducted in cryosections of normal human and Cynomolgus monkey 
tissues (Report IM1025). Tissue samples from human and Cynomolgus monkeys were stained with 
ramucirumab at 2 protein concentrations (5 μg/mL and 0.5 μg/mL). Tissue cross-reactivity was observed 
in vascular endothelium in both human and Cynomolgus monkey tissues, consistently with the 
distribution of the molecular target of ramucirumab, VEGFR-2. Cytoplasmic (and possibly 
membrane-associated) reactivity was also detected in the retina of the eye of both species. The test 
article stained several cell types of the monocyte-macrophage lineage in the lung (human only), liver 
(human and monkey), lymph node (human only), and spleen (monkey only). Granular cytoplasmic 
staining was seen in the connective tissues of the central and peripheral nervous system, including the 
meninges of the brain and spinal cord (both species), and the perineurium (both species). Labeling 
occurred also in the interstitial stroma of the lung (human only). The test article stained of several 
epithelial cell types, including alveolar epithelium in the lung (both species), epithelium of remnants of 
Rathke’s pouch in the pituitary (human only), glandular epithelium of the salivary gland (both species), 
and choroid plexus epithelium of the brain (monkey only). 
2.3.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA was submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical pharmacodynamic data adequately showed that ramucirumab binds specifically and with 
high affinity to human VEGFR-2 thereby inhibiting VEGFR-2 pathway, and provided a proof-of-concept in 
human cancer xenograft models in mice to support treatment of gastric cancer patients.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Receptor 2 is the key mediator of VEGF induced angiogenesis. 
Ramucirumab is a human receptor-targeted antibody that specifically binds VEGF Receptor 2 and blocks 
binding of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. As a result, ramucirumab inhibits ligand stimulated activation of 
VEGF Receptor 2 and its downstream signalling components, including p44/p42 mitogen-activated 
protein kinases, neutralizing ligand-induced proliferation and migration of human endothelial cells (see 
SmPC, section 5.1). 
Ramucirumab has the potential to bind to C1q. However, apparently this potential to bind to C1q does not 
translate into a potential to induce CDC.  While no formal secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been 
conducted, the results of the ADCC assays were provided. Both the ADCC receptor gene assay and the 
classical cytotoxicity assay using ramucirumab and PBMC indicated that ramucirumab did not induce an 
ADCC response.  As an explanation for this lack of ADCC, even though ramucirumab can bind to CD16, 
was suggested to lie in other factors such as receptor density and availability, and interfering receptors on 
the target cells. This raised the question whether the appropriate target cells were used in these assays. 
To accurately determine the ability of the antibody to induce ADCC, these target cells should display a 
similar receptor density/availability as the target cells in vivo.  In the ADCC assays, two different target 
cell populations were used, VEGFR2 transfected porcine cells and the HCC-827 cell line. No information on 
the VEGFR2 density/availability on these target cells was provided. However, in general target gene 
expression is usually rather high in transfected cells. Furthermore, it is not very likely that both cell lines 
would exhibit high levels of interfering receptors prohibiting ADCC. Overall, ramucirumab was negative in 
two different ADCC assays in vitro, using two different target cell lines and it is considered unlikely that 
ramucirumab will display ADCC activity in vivo 
The Cynomolgus monkey can be considered an appropriate nonclinical species for ramucirumab toxicity 
testing given the comparable binding affinity of ramucirumab to its receptor in humans and Cynomolgus 
monkeys, and the fact that pharmacological effects have been seen in this test species. 
A target-mediated saturation of a clearance pathway for ramucirumab in Cynomolgus monkeys was 
observed. In addition, no differences in kinetics were observed between the different ramucirumab 
production processes. The data obtained after repeated dosing was very limited, but the available data 
indicated that similar Cmax and AUC values were reached after Dose 1 compared to Dose 39. Regarding 
the possible correlation between the presence of ADAs in the Cynomolgus monkey serum samples and the 
lower serum concentrations of ramucirumab, it is possible that the development of ADAs has decreased 
the exposure of animals to ramucirumab. However, since the pharmacology related effects were observed 
and due to a slower clearance of ramucirumab in the high-dose group animals it can be concluded that the 
monkeys were sufficiently exposed to ramucirumab, and that the toxicity data are considered reliable. 
The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) range was in the range of plasma volume for monkeys, 
indicating that ramucirumab did not substantially distribute beyond the vasculature. In general, the 
kinetics of ramucirumab in toxicological test species matches that of human kinetics (non-linear, 
distribution limited to vascular space, relative long half-life time) and are what it is expected from an 
antibody. Exposures in animals were similar or exceeded those in humans.

Hypertension, an established clinical adverse drug reaction of therapies targeting inhibitors of the 
VEGF/VEGF Receptor 2 pathway, was not observed in monkey repeat-dose toxicity studies of 
ramucirumab based on limited assessment of blood pressure in these toxicology studies. However 
hypertension was observed in the clinical studies. Based on published information and pharmacology 
reviews of approved inhibitors of the VEGF/VEGF Receptor 2 pathway, nonclinical animal species are poor 
predictors of anti-VEGF receptor-induced hypertension in the clinic.  Other factors that may be 
contributing to poor predictability of nonclinical studies with ramucirumab and with other inhibitors of the 
VEGF/VEGF Receptor 2 pathway included techniques used in assessing blood pressure, frequency and 
duration in which blood pressure is measured (single time point versus continuous direct intravascular 
measurement of blood pressure), small number of animals used in toxicology studies compared to large 
clinical trial patient population and health status of the animals (healthy animals used in toxicology 
studies). 
No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted. However safety pharmacology parameters were 
assessed as part of the GLP-compliant in the 5- week and 39-weeks toxicology studies in Cynomolgus 
monkey and no treatment-related effects were observed. 
No single-dose toxicity studies were conducted since no signs of acute toxicity were observed after 
administration of the highest single ramucirumab test dose of 50 mg/kg in the 39-week and wound 
healing studies.  
The target organs identified in repeated dose Cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies were kidney 
(glomerulonephritis), bone (thickening and abnormal endochondral ossification of the epiphyseal growth 
plate) and female reproductive organs (decreased weight of ovaries and uterus) (see SmPC, section 5.3). 
Glomerulonephritis was seen in animals after treatment with a dose of ≥  4 mg/kg. Severity increased in 
a dose related manner. In principle kidney effects may be related to the pharmacodynamics action of 
ramucirumab (i.e. interfering with VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling). However the formation of immune 
complexes resulting from ADA formation is also a possible explanation. In some clinical trials, proteinuria 
has been reported. A clear effect of ramucirumab treatment of Cynomolgus monkeys was the thickening 
and osteochondropathy of the epiphyseal growth plates in both femurs. This effect was already observed 
in the lowest dose treatment group in both the 5 and the 39 weeks study. These bone growth plate related 
effects appear to be class related and might be clinically relevant for children, but probably not for adult 
patient population. 
A minimal grade of inflammation and/or mononuclear cell infiltration was seen in several organs (see 
SmPC, section 5.3). It is not clear whether this specific inflammation is clinically relevant since in the 
clinical trials no clear signs of inflammation have been observed. 
Genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, developmental or reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with 
ramucirumab in line with available guidance [ICH S9 (EMEA/CHMP/ICH/646107/2008)] as ramucirumab 
is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer. However the applicant will perform 
analysis of incidence of secondary malignancies observed in clinical trials (see Risk Management Plan).

No reproductive toxicity studies with ramucirumab were conducted; however, animal models link 
angiogenesis, VEGF and VEGFR-2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryo-foetal development, 
and postnatal development. Literature data indicated potential risks to fertility, pregnancy and 
development if VEGF signaling is inhibited leading to anti-angiogenic effects. Based on ramucirumab’s 
mechanism of action, it is likely that in animals, ramucirumab will inhibit angiogenesis and result in 
adverse effects on fertility (ovulation), placental development, developing foetuses and postnatal 
development (see SmPC, section 5.3). Reproductive and developmental toxicity has been categorized as 
a potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Cyramza should only be used if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk during 
pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while being treated with ramucirumab, she should be 
informed of the potential risk to the maintenance of pregnancy and the risk to the foetus. Cyramza is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see 
SmPC, section 4.6). 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on Cyramza and 
should be informed of the potential hazard to the pregnancy and foetus. Women of child bearing potential 
should use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after the last dose of ramucirumab 
treatment. It is unknown whether ramucirumab is excreted in human milk. Excretion in milk and oral 
absorption is expected to be low. As a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded, breast-feeding should 
be discontinued during treatment with Cyramza and for at least 3 months after the last dose (see SmPC, 
section 4.6). 
The animal data did not indicate non-tolerable adverse reactions at the injection sites. 
A single dose of ramucirumab did not impair wound healing in monkeys using a full-thickness incisional 
model (see SmPC, section 5.3). 
Tissue cross-reactivity was observed in vascular endothelium in both human and Cynomolgus monkey 
tissues, consistently with the distribution of the molecular target of ramucirumab, VEGFR-2. Cytoplasmic 
(and possibly membrane-associated) reactivity was also detected in the retina of the eye of both species. 
An unexpected binding of ramucirumab to certain tissues with partially different pattern in human and 
Cynomolgus monkeys was observed. However, toxicities related to those tissues were not observed in 
repeat dose toxicity studies, and those could be regarded as insignificant.  
Antibodies, as other peptides and proteins, are exempted from environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
based on the EMA 2006 Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab were evaluated in 8 studies (JVBW, JVBX, JVBY, JVBJ, JVCA [DDI 
study], JVCC [DDI study], JVBD [REGARD], and JVBE [RAINBOW]), a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, an exposure-response analysis based on RAINBOW study and updated immunogenicity data 
with 6 additional studies. The population pharmacokinetic analysis (PopPK) dataset consisted of 497 
patients with 2782 observations. Ramucirumab was administered as an i.v. infusion over approximately 
60 minutes, at either 8 mg/kg every two weeks on a 14 day (JVBD, JVBY), 28 day (JVBW, JVCA, JVBE) 
cycle or 10 mg/kg every three weeks on a 21 day (JVBJ, JVBX, JVCC) cycle. 
Absorption  
Cyramza is administered as an intravenous infusion. There have been no studies performed with other 
routes of administration Following the dose regimen of 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the geometric means of 
ramucirumab Cmin were 49.5 μg/ml (range of 6.3-228 μg/ml) and 74.4 μg/ml (range of 13.8-234 μg/ml) 
prior to administration of the fourth and seventh dose, respectively of ramucirumab given as a single 
agent, in serum from patients with advanced gastric cancer (see SmPC, section 5.2).  
Distribution 
Based on population pharmacokinetic approach (PopPK), the mean volume of distribution at steady state 
for ramucirumab was 5.5L (see SmPC, section 5.2). 
Elimination 
Based on PopPK, the mean clearance of ramucirumab was 0.014L/hour and the mean half-life was 15 
days (see SmPC, section 5.2).

There was no clear deviation from dose proportionality in pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab from 6 mg/kg 
to 20 mg/kg. An accumulation ratio of 1.5 was observed for ramucirumab when dosed every 2 weeks. 
Based on simulations using the PopPK model, steady state would be attained by the sixth dose (see 
SmPC, section 5.2).

In the pivotal studies there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at increased 
risk of adverse events compared to patients younger than 65 years old. No dose reductions are 
recommended (see SmPC, section 4.2). Based on PopPK, there was no difference in ramucirumab 
exposure in patients ≥  65 years of age compared to patients < 65 years old (see SmPC, section 5.2). 
No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab. Based on PopPK, ramucirumab exposure was similar in patients with 
mild renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥  60 to < 90 ml/min) and moderate renal 
impairment (CrCl ≥  30 to <60 ml/min) as to patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥  90 ml/min). No 
data are available from patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/min) (see SmPC, section 
5.2). Clinical data suggest that no dose adjustments are required in patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment (see SmPC, section 4.2). 
No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab. Based on PopPK, ramucirumab exposure in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin 1.0-1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) or AST > ULN as defined using NCI criteria) 
were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST ≤  ULN). 
Ramucirumab has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin > 1.5 to ≤  3.0 ULN and any AST; and total bilirubin > 3.0 ULN and any AST, respectively) (see 
SmPC section 5.2). No dose reductions are recommended (see SmPC, section 4.2). Prior to each 
paclitaxel infusion, patients should have a complete blood count and blood chemistry performed to 
evaluate hepatic function (see SmPC, section 4.2).  
Based on PopPK, the following covariates were found to have no impact on ramucirumab disposition: age 
(range, 19 to 86 years), sex (316 males, 181 females), race (337 White and 139 Asians), body weight 
(range, 31.9 to 133.0 kg), albumin levels (range, 15.5 to 64.8 g/L) (see SmPC, section 5.2). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Two studies were conducted to assess the effect of concomitant ramucirumab on the PK of paclitaxel 
(JVCA) and docetaxel (JVCC), respectively. 
In Study JVCA, concomitant administration of ramucirumab had no effect on paclitaxel exposure with 
ratios of geometric least squares (LS) means at 1.09 (90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 1.29) for AUC(0-
∞) and 0.97 (90% CI: 0.83, 1.13) for Cmax. In addition, similar ramucirumab PK parameters were 
observed with or without paclitaxel administration (ratio with paclitaxel vs. alone were 1.00 (90% CI: 
0.84, 1.19) for AUC(0-∞) and 1.07 (90% CI: 0.93, 1.24) for Cmax, respectively.  
In Study JVCC, dose-normalized AUC(0-∞) and Cmax of docetaxel were similar whether docetaxel was 
administered with or without ramucirumab. The reported ratios of geometric LS means and 90% CI were 
0.97 (90% CI: 0.84, 1.10) for AUC(0-∞) and 1.14 (90% CI: 0.84, 1.55) for Cmax.

Biomarkers were not systematically investigated in the phase 1 and phase 2 studies. VEGF 
overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, and VEGFR-2 
inhibition by ramucirumab is part of the rationale to investigate ramucirumab in advanced gastric cancer. 
However, patients were not stratified for VEGF or VEGFR-2 baseline expression in the REGARD or 
RAINBOW studies. 
In REGARD, biomarkers were evaluated in part of the study population. VEGF-A was not determined. 
Immunohistochemical assay for VEGFR2 protein expression in tumour tissue showed very little VEGFR2 
staining in the tumour nuclei 14/144 (9.7%), cytoplasm 33/148 (22.9%), or membrane 11/144 (7.6%). 
The number of positive samples is too small for correlative analyses. Further, expression of soluble VEGFR 
was not determined while ramucirumab is likely first to bind to soluble VEGFR-2. Positive VEGFR-2 
staining of neoplastic vessels was observed in 86.7% of the patients. No correlation with PK of 
ramucirumab and VEGFR-2 staining in neoplastic vessels was observed. In contrast, patients with high 
VEGFR-2 staining compared to low VEGFR-2 staining seemed to have a better OS/PFS effect of 
ramucirumab compared to placebo although this seemed mainly due to shorter OS/PFS for the placebo 
arm in patients with high VEGFR-2 staining. 
In the RAINBOW study, no tissue samples were collected, and therefore, the potential correlation 
between VEGFR-2 staining of the neoplastic vessels and clinical outcome as observed in REGARD could 
not be evaluated in RAINBOW. Plasma concentrations of VEGF-C, VEGF-D and sVEGFR-2 were analysed 
but VEGF-A could not be analysed reliably. Data from 56% of the ITT were available.  Based on the 
available data, there were no significant interactions between clinical outcome (OS and PFS) and any of 
the baseline plasma biomarker measures:  VEGF-C, VEGF-D, or sVEGFR-2. Additional results from 
developed assays are on-going and not yet available.  Results of these exploratory assays are expected 
in late Q4 2014 or Q1 2015 and will be submitted by the applicant further to the CHMP’s recommendation. 
The potential for ramucirumab to prolong the corrected QT (QTc) interval was assessed in Study JVBK in 
patients with advanced cancer (of solid tumour origin). Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Patients 
received ramucirumab 10 mg/kg, administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 minutes, once 
every 3 weeks for a minimum of 9 weeks. QTc values that corrected to heart rate effect were used as a 
dependent variable. The time-matched mean change from the baseline QTc interval was estimated at 
each ECG sampling time point for each patient. Sixty-five patients completed the study according 
protocol. Assay sensitivity was demonstrated by moxifloxacin 400 mg. For ramucirumab, the 90% 
two-sided (95% one-sided) upper confidence limit never exceeded 10 msec at any time following 10 
mg/kg ramucirumab administration. An increase in QTcF of >30 msec and ≤ 60 msec was seen in 3 
patients (5 time points) in Cycle 3 and an increase of >60 msec was observed in one patient but the QTcF 
value remained <450 msec. No correlation between ramucirumab concentration and QTc prolongation 
was observed. 
Premedication with diphenhydramine was implemented in the REGARD study as result of the incidence of 
grade 3 and grade 4 IRRs in six patients and one patient, respectively, in studies JVBO and JVBQ.  
Patients in REGARD and RAINBOW were tested at multiple time-points for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). 
Samples were tested from 956 patients: 527 ramucirumab-treated patients and 429 control treated 
patients. Eleven (2.2%) of ramucirumab-treated patients and 2 (0.5%) of control-treated patients 
developed ADAs. None of the patients with ADAs experienced an IRR. In the REGARD and RAINBOW 
studies, no patients had neutralising antibodies to ramucirumab (see SmPC section 5.1). 
In RAINBOW study, Exposure-response analyses indicated that efficacy and specific measures of safety of 
ramucirumab were correlated with ramucirumab exposure. Efficacy, as measured by improvements in OS 
and PFS, was associated with increasing ramucirumab exposure range produced by 8 mg/kg 
ramucirumab given on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle (see SmPC section 5.2). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015

The incidences of Grade ≥ 3 hypertension, neutropenia, and leukopenia were also increased with higher 
ramucirumab exposure (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on limited PK data, exposure-response analysis suggested in RECARG study, that efficacy of 
ramucirumab was correlated with ramucirumab exposure (see SmPC section 5.2).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic characteristics of ramucirumab were typical IgG antibody pharmacokinetics i.e. low 
distribution volume, slow clearance and long elimination half-life. No dose modifications are considered 
necessary for gender, age, race, weight, mild and moderate renal impairment. 
Bodyweight was no covariate in the final popPK model and as such dosing based on bodyweight is 
disputable. There was a trend for concentrations to increase in the higher body weight patients using the 
current weight-based dosing regimen: the median-predicted ramucirumab exposure at steady state in 
the highest body weight quartile group was 41.6% greater than that of the lowest body weight quartile 
group. Post-hoc exposure covariate analysis showed a relation between clearance body weight and 
between volume of distribution and body weight, supporting a body-weight based dose regimen. As the 
correlation was less than proportional, which is common for antibodies this results in a somewhat lower 
exposure in patients with low bodyweight compared to patient with a high bodyweight. There was a 
considerable overlap in the distributions of the concentrations when comparing the different weight 
quartiles. Bodyweight was considered no covariate in the popPK model as inclusion of bodyweight did not 
reduce the inter-patient variability with >5% as was predefined in the protocol. Body weight had no effect 
on clinical outcomes but exposure was the primary factor predictive of clinical outcome (see discussion on 
dose-response study).  
Data on renal function did not indicate significant differences in Ctrough in patients with normal renal 
function or mild to moderate renal impairment.  There are no data in patients with severe renal 
impairment. The rather constant Vss observed represent rather homogenous study population and might 
wrongly represent overhydrated patients in a clinical setting. Simulation results indicated that over 
hydration with 25% to 50% Vss increase may reduce maximum concentration (Cmax) by 10% to 20%, but 
is unlikely to impact area under the curve and minimum concentration (Cmin). Therefore, the possibility of 
significant exposure reduction due to overhydration is low. 
VEGF overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma and a potential 
imbalance of the two arms for VEGF overexpression may affect the outcome of the pivotal REGARD study.  
The non-clinical studies showed that binding of ramucirumab to VEGF Receptor 2 prevents interaction 
with activating ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D).  As a result, ramucirumab inhibits activation of 
VEGF Receptor 2 and its downstream intracellular signalling components, including p44/p42 
mitogen-activated protein kinases, neutralizing ligand-induced proliferation and migration of human 
endothelial cells and leads to increased levels of ligands. The impact on VEGFR-2 signalling pathway 
seems relevant to primary pharmacology of ramucirumab. 
In REGARD, positive VEGFR-2 staining of neoplastic vessels was observed in 86.7% of the patients. 
Patients with high VEGFR-2 staining compared to low VEGFR-2 staining seemed to have a better OS/PFS 
effect of ramucirumab compared to placebo although this seemed mainly due to shorter OS/PFS for the 
placebo arm in patients with high VEGFR-2 staining suggesting that VEGFR-2 could be a prognostic factor. 
Unfortunately no tumour tissue was collected in the RAINBOW study, thus the potential correlation 
between VEGFR-2 staining of the neoplastic vessels and clinical outcome as observed in REGARD could 
not be evaluated in RAINBOW. In RAINBOW, plasma concentrations of VEGF-C, VEGF-D and sVEGFR-2 
but not VEGF-A were analysed in 56% of ITT. Based on the available data, there were no significant 
interactions between clinical outcome (OS and PFS) and any of the baseline plasma biomarker measures:  
VEGF-C, VEGF-D, or sVEGFR-2.  
The number of HER-2 positive samples (12 out of 147) in REGARD was too low to conclude on a beneficial 
effect of ramucirumab in patients with HER2 positive tumours. The absence of tumour tissue in the 
RAINBOW study limits the potential identification of specific biomarkers involved in efficacy of

ramucirumab.Immunogenicity of ramucirumab was rather low. It was not certain that the screening and 
confirmation assay will detect all ADAs as during the development of the assay no attention has been paid 
to the potential presence of NGNA and α-Gal in the reagents. In particular the α-Gal site in ramucirumab 
may be of concern as specific IgE to galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-gal) was shown to be linked with 
hypersensitivity reactions to cetuximab (Chung et al. 2008, Jacquenet et al 2009). The applicant 
discussed that mAbs that are only glycosylated in their Fc domains such as ramucirumab and produced in 
rodent cell lines do not bind α-Gal–specific IgE antibodies (Lammerts van Beuren et al. 2011 and Qian et 
al. 2007). This is considered reasonable. Further, presence of IgE anti-α-Gal antibodies was evaluated by 
a separate assay. There was a lack of any relationship between the presence of IgE anti-α-Gal antibodies 
and IRRs in sera from patients in REGARD and RAINBOW. The overall rate of IRRs, acute allergic or 
anaphylactic reactions was low in REGARD and RAINBOW. 
Ramucirumab exposure in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 1.0-1.5 upper limit of 
normal (ULN)) or AST >ULN as defined using NCI criteria) were similar to those in patients with normal 
hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST < ULN). However, liver events were higher in phase II JVBQ study 
among hepatocellular carcinoma patients. This safety concern has been adequately addressed in section 
4.4 of the SmPC. Patients with Child-Pugh Class A and Class B have been enrolled in the on-going Phase 
3 study of RAM treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (JVBF). The CHMP recommended the 
MAH to submit the results upon completion of the study. 
Ramucirumab has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin >1.5 to ≤ 3.0 ULN and any AST; and total bilirubin >3.0 ULN and any AST, respectively). This has 
been addressed in the SmPC.  
The risks for pharmacokinetic interaction of ramucirumab as a monoclonal antibody are considered low. 
Interaction studies of ramucirumab with paclitaxel and docetaxel indicated that ramucirumab does not 
affect the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel or docetaxel and vice versa.   
In RAINBOW study, exposure-response analyses indicated that efficacy and specific measures of safety of 
ramucirumab were correlated with ramucirumab exposure. Efficacy, as measured by improvements in OS 
and PFS, was associated with increasing ramucirumab exposure range produced by 8  mg/kg 
ramucirumab given on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. The incidences of Grade ≥ 3 hypertension, 
neutropenia, and leukopenia were also increased with higher ramucirumab exposure) (see SmPC section 
5.2). 
Based on limited PK data in REGARD study, exposure-response analysis suggested that efficacy of 
ramucirumab was correlated with ramucirumab exposure (see SmPC section 5.2). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab has been investigated sufficiently. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
A target concentration of 18 µg/mL was aimed for in gastric cancer patients based on tumour growth 
inhibition of human xenografts in nude mice by rat anti-VEGFR-2 antibody DC-101.  
Weekly doses of ramucirumab ranging from 2 to 16 mg/kg were evaluated in Phase 1 Study JVBM. A 
maximum tolerated dose for weekly dosing was identified as 13 mg/kg (2 dose-limiting toxicities were 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 37/102 
 
 
  
 
observed in patients receiving the 16-mg/kg weekly dose, Grade 3 deep vein thrombosis and Grade 3 
hypertension).  
Preliminary efficacy was observed across a range of doses, including the 2-mg/kg dose. Pharmacokinetic 
results from Study JVBM suggested that ramucirumab exhibited nonlinear PK characteristics. Apparent 
nonlinear PK profiles were observed between 2 and 8 mg/kg; PK profiles appeared to be linear at doses 
of 8 mg/kg and above, suggesting saturation of the target-mediated (VEGF Receptor 2) clearance 
pathway. Every-2-week (6 to 10 mg/kg) and every-3-week (15 to 20 mg/kg) dose regimens were 
evaluated in an additional dose-ranging study (Study JVBN). No MTD was identified for every-2-week or 
every-3-week dosing; all dose regimens were well tolerated. 
Two dose regimens, 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, were selected for subsequent 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. These doses and schedules were selected because they were associated 
with PK profiles suggesting target receptor saturation; Ctrough concentrations were higher than 18 
μg/mL a concentration shown to be efficacious in mice, and activity was observed at and below these 
doses and with these schedules in Phase 1 studies. 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses were performed to characterize the relationship between 
ramucirumab exposure and selected measures of efficacy and safety in REGARD and RAINBOW. Two of 
the E-R analyses pertained to efficacy endpoints: overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival 
(PFS).  In REGARD study, clear separations between the OS curves were observed among the 2 exposure 
groups, suggesting that higher exposure is associated with longer survival (median OS 11.0 vs. 5.8 
months).  The Kaplan–Meier plots of PFS curves showed comparable relationship for PFS and 
ramucirumab exposure (data not shown).  In RAINBOW study, ramucirumab exposure was divided in 
quartiles. Separations between the OS curves were observed among 4 exposure groups, indicating that 
the higher the exposure within the exposure range of 8 mg/kg, the longer is the associated survival.  
The E-R analysis for safety evaluated the most frequent severe (that is, Grade ≥ 3) treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in at least 10% of patients and at higher incidence in the ramucirumab 
plus paclitaxel arm were neutropenia, leukopenia, and hypertension. In RAINBOW, the incidences of 
Grade ≥ 3 hypertension, neutropenia, and leukopenia were also increased with higher ramucirumab 
exposure. For both arms, patients with a previous history of hypertension had an increased incidence of 
Grade ≥ 3 hypertension, older patients had increased incidence of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, and Asian 
patients had increased incidence of both Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and Grade ≥ 3 leukopenia. 
Main studies 
Study I4T-IE-JVBD (REGARD) 
Methods 
Study REGARD (I4T-IE-JVBD) was a pivotal,  global, multicentre, randomized, double-blind phase 3 study 
comparing the safety and efficacy of single-agent ramucirumab  plus best supportive care (BSC) versus 
placebo plus BSC in patients with metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma 
following disease progression on first-line platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-containing combination therapy. 
Study participants  
The REGARD study population included patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic 
or locally recurrent, unresectable gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma not 
amenable to curative resection. Patients were required to have experienced disease progression during or 
within 4 months after the last dose of first-line therapy for metastatic disease, or during or within 6 
months after the last dose of adjuvant therapy. Acceptable first-line regimens for this study were 
combination chemotherapy regimens that included platinum and/or fluoropyrimidine components. All 
patients had received prior anticancer therapy, 81% of which received at least a combination of platinum 
CHMP assessment report

and fluoropyrimidine as first line treatment. Other inclusion criteria included an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score of 0-1, adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤
1.5 mg/dL, AST and ALT ≤  3.0 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), adequate renal function (creatinine ≤
1.5 x the ULN or creatinine clearance (measured or calculated) ≥  40 mL/minute), adequate coagulation 
function as defined by INR ≤ 1.5 and a PTT≤  5 above the ULN unless receiving anticoagulation therapy).  
Patients were excluded if they had documented and/or symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases, 
an on-going or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, 
symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled thrombotic or haemorrhagic disorder, 
uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension despite standard medical management, or any other 
serious uncontrolled medical disorders in the opinion of the investigator, any Grade 3-4 gastrointestinal 
bleeding within 3 months prior to randomization, arterial thromboembolic events, serious or non-healing 
wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to randomization, prior therapy with an agent that 
directly inhibits VEGF or VEGF receptor 2 activity (including bevacizumab), or any anti-angiogenic agent 
and current chronic antiplatelet therapy. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either ramucirumab (administered i.v.) every 2 weeks at a 
dose of 8 mg/kg) or placebo plus BSC. BSC could not include additional concurrent anticancer treatment 
(for example, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, biologic response modifiers, or other 
investigational agents). BSC could include antiemetic agents, opiate and non-opiate analgesic agents, 
appetite stimulants, and other supportive care agents. 
Ramucirumab or placebo was administered every 2 weeks until disease progression, the development of 
unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent by the patient. Up to 2 reductions to the 
dose of ramucirumab (to 6 mg/kg and subsequently to 5 mg/kg) were permitted in case of 
non-life-threatening, reversible grade 3 or 4 AEs that improved to grade 0 or 1 or resolved to grade 0 
within 1 cycle.  
Patients underwent radiographic assessments of disease status approximately every 6 weeks following 
start of treatment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to show superiority of ramucirumab plus BSC versus placebo plus 
BSC in terms of overall survival (OS). Secondary objectives included the evaluation of Progression Free 
Survival (PFS), including 12-week PFS rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR), Duration of Response (DoR), 
Quality of life (QoL), safety, pharmacodynamic profile of ramucirumab and immunogenicity of 
ramucirumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary study endpoint was overall survival (OS), defined as the interval between date of 
randomization and the date of death from any cause. Patients who were alive at the time of data cut off 
or who were lost to follow-up had data censored at the time they were last known to be alive.  
Secondary endpoints included Progression-Free Survival (PFS) (defined as the time from the date of 
randomization until the date of objectively determined PD or death due to any cause, whichever was first) 
-Objective response rate (ORR) (defined as the proportion of patients achieving a best overall response of 
partial (PR) or complete response (CR) and Quality of life as measured by European Organisation for 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 39/102 
 
 
  
 
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), a 
self-administered, cancer-specific questionnaire with multidimensional scales, was completed at baseline 
(within 14 days prior to randomization) and prior to the infusion of Cycles 4, 7, and 10 (that is, after 
approximately 6, 12, and 18 weeks on study). QoL was not evaluated at the time of discontinuation. 
Sample size 
The sample size of this study was estimated to be 348 patients with 268 events based on the following 
assumptions: overall one-sided type I error rate to be 0.025 (or two-sided at 0.05) and study power 80%; 
median OS of 5 months in the placebo + BSC control arm; an increase of at least 45% (2.25-month) 
improvement in median OS in the ramucirumab arm (i.e., 7.25 months, or HR = 0.69); randomization 
ratio 2:1 (ramucirumab: placebo); one interim futility analysis at 35% of total number of OS events; a 
30-month accrual period and a drop-out rate of 10%.   
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to receive ramucirumab or placebo with a ratio of 2:1. Randomization was 
stratified by: 
• 
• 
• 
Weight loss (≥ 10% over the prior 3 months vs. <10%) 
Geographic region (North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand vs. South and Central 
America, India, Egypt, South Africa, Lebanon, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia vs. Asia) 
Location of the primary tumour (gastric [including tumours of the gastric cardia that extend into 
the GEJ] vs. GEJ [including tumours of the distal oesophagus that extend into the GEJ, and 
tumours involving the GEJ when precise identification of the organ of origin was not possible]). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blinded study.  
Statistical methods 
The primary population for the efficacy analysis was the ITT population which included all randomized 
patients. The Modified Intention-to-Treat (mITT) population was a subset of the ITT population including 
only randomized patients who received any dose of investigational product and was to be used for 
secondary analyses. The safety population included all patients who received any dose of an 
investigational product (ramucirumab or placebo). The Per-Protocol (PP) population consisted of the 
randomized and treated patients who did not have a major protocol violation. The PP population was to be 
used for supportive efficacy analyses.  
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses were not adjusted for any covariates, except via 
stratification for the randomization factors. 
An interim futility analysis was to be conducted when 35% of the expected number of OS events was 
observed.

Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled between 6 October 2009 and 26 January 2012. A total of 119 centres in 29 
countries were involved. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was issued on 05 March 2008. The protocol was amended 8 times. No patients were 
enrolled under protocol amendments 1 through 3 inclusive. The major changes for amendments 4-8 are 
described below: 
Amendment 4 (dated 01 July 2009) essentially included bleeding (haemorrhagic) events to the list of 
possible adverse events of concern, and discussion of these events in the context of ramucirumab 
treatment was included. Guidelines regarding the grading and treatment of infusion-related reactions and 
hypertension were updated to be consistent with NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0. In addition, guidelines for the 
management of proteinuria were updated, allowing patients with proteinuria ≥2+ per dipstick or routine 
urinalysis to receive ramucirumab or placebo as scheduled prior to 24-hour urine collection. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 41/102 
 
 
 
  
 
Amendment 5 (dated 08 February 2010) essentially added new markers at baseline. 
Amendment 6 (dated 20 April 2010) included only minor changes and clarifications. 
Amendment 7 (dated 23 November 2010). The major changes were a decrease in planned sample size 
from 615 patients to 315 patients (at this date, only 36 patients had been randomized into the study) in 
order to modify the trial to an appropriate size and minimize the number of patients required and a 
reduction of follow-up time for OS from 1.5 to 1 year. Finally, gastrointestinal perforation was added, 
reflecting newly available analysis of safety information from Phase 2 studies. 
Amendment 8 (dated 31 October 2011). The number of OS events required for the final analysis was 
increased by 12 events to correct a calculation in previous sample size estimation. This resulted in an 
increase of the planned sample size by 33 to 348 patients. Other substantive changes from Version 6.0 
included survival follow-up following discontinuation of study therapy to every 2 months from every 3 
months and a clear definition of the end of the trial, to allow for patients to receive study therapy in a 
defined extension phase occurring after the number of events required for final analysis of the primary 
end point was observed, and defined the assessments and procedures to be performed during this 
extension phase (prior to the end of trial).

Other secondary endpoints 
Of the 238 patients assigned to ramucirumab, 1 patient experienced a complete response (CR), with 7 
additional experiencing a PR. Of the 117 patients assigned to placebo, no patients experienced a CR and 
3 experienced a PR. The ORR (CR + PR) for the ramucirumab arm was 3.4% compared with 2.6% in the 
placebo arm (p=0.7556).

A total of 234 (98.3%) patients in the ramucirumab arm and 113 (96.6%) patients in the placebo arm 
completed at least 1 QoL questionnaire. Compliance to complete a QoL questionnaire decreased sharply 
with each cycle of treatment, resulting in only 27.7% completing questionnaires at cycle 7 in the 
ramucirumab arm vs. 9.4% in the placebo arm. Across all QoL scales and items, mean change from 
baseline was similar between treatment arms. No significant difference regarding global health was 
observed between the two treatment arms in change from baseline at cycle 4 (p=0.4371) or cycle 7 
(p=0.3744). Moreover, no significant difference was observed between the two arms in change from 
baseline for physical subscales: fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, loss of appetite 
and diarrhoea. 
ECOG PS was assessed at baseline, every 2 weeks during treatment, at the end of therapy and at the 
30-day follow-up visit. Exploratory analyses of time to deterioration to ECOG PS ≥2 and time to 
deterioration in ECOG PS by ≥1 point and PS by ≥2 point indicated a delayed time to deterioration in 
performance status with ramucirumab (data not shown).

Treatments 
Ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) was administered as an i.v. infusion on Days 1 and 15, in combination with 
paclitaxel (80mg/m2) administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. An equivalent volume of 
placebo was administered by i.v. on Days 1 and 15, in combination with paclitaxel (80mg/m2) 
administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to show efficacy in terms of prolonged survival time in patients 
treated with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel compared to patients treated with placebo plus paclitaxel as 
second-line treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal (GEJ) adenocarcinoma after failure of any 
platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet with or without anthracycline (epirubicin or doxorubicin). 
Secondary objectives included the evaluation of Progression Free Survival (PFS), time to progression 
(TTP), best overall response (BOR), objective response rate (ORR), the safety profile of ramucirumab in 
combination with paclitaxel, patient-reported outcome measures (European Organisation for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D, the pharmacodynamic profile of ramucirumab 
and to assess the immunonogenicity and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ramucirumab.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary study endpoint was overall survival (OS), defined as the interval between date of 
randomization and the date of death from any cause. Patients who were alive at the time of data cut off 
or who were lost to follow-up had data censored at the time they were last known to be alive. 
Secondary endpoints included Progression-Free Survival (PFS) (defined as the time from the date of 
randomization until the date of objectively determined PD or death due to any cause, whichever was 
first)- Objective Response Rate (ORR) (defined as the proportion of patients achieving a best overall 
response of partial (PR) or complete response (CR)- Time to progression (TTP) [defined as the time from 
the date of randomization until the date of radiographic progression according to RECIST (Version 1.1)]- 
Best overall response (BOR) (defined as the best response across all time points from randomization until 
radiologically confirmed tumour progression)- Quality of life (QoL) as measured by European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 
(EORTC-QLQ-C30)-other secondary objectives aimed at evaluating the safety profile of ramucirumab in 
combination with paclitaxel, assessing the immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic parameters of 
ramucirumab.  
Sample size 
The sample size of this study was estimated to be 663 patients with 510 events based on the following 
assumptions:  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 52/102 
 
 
  
 
•  Accrual rate = 30 patients per month (including 5% drop-outs) 
•  1:1 randomization 
•  Alpha = 0.025 (one-sided) 
• 
• 
 Power = 90% 
 HR = 0.75 [that is, median OS time of 7.0 months in the control group (placebo plus Paclitaxel) 
and 9.33 months in the test group (ramucirumab plus paclitaxel) assuming exponential 
distribution]. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to receive ramucirumab plus paclitaxel or placebo plus paclitaxel with a ratio of 
1:1. Randomization was stratified by: 
• 
• 
• 
Time to Progression (TTP) from the start of the first-line chemotherapy (<6 months vs. ≥6 
months)  
Geographic region (North America, Europe (including Israel), Australia vs. South and Central 
America vs. Asia) 
Disease measurability (measurable versus non-measurable disease) 
Blinding 
This was a double-blinded study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary population for the efficacy analysis was the ITT population which included all randomized 
patients. The safety population included all patients who received any dose of an investigational product 
(ramucirumab, placebo or paclitaxel). The Per-Protocol (PP) population consisted of the randomized and 
treated patients who did not have a major protocol violation. The PP population was to be used for 
supportive efficacy analyses. 
An interim futility analysis was to be conducted when 25% of the expected number of mortality events 
was observed.

Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled between 23 December 2010 and 12 July 2013. A total of 170 centres in 27 
countries were involved. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was issued on 01 June 2010. The protocol was amended 3 times, none of which 
included changes to the study design. No patients were enrolled under protocol amendments 1.1 through 
3 inclusive. The major changes for amendments are described below: 
Amendment 1.1 (dated 08 July 2010) contained administrative changes only. 
Amendment 2 (dated 06 December 2010: The important changes included additional clarification of 
inclusion criteria regarding:  the age of patient (the patient had to be at least 18 years of age or of an 
acceptable age according to local regulations, whichever was older); the diagnosis of the disease (the 
patient had a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma); the 
disease progression [the patient had experienced documented objective radiographic or clinical disease 
progression that was confirmed by pathologic criteria (histology and/or cytology) if appropriate, during 
first-line therapy with any platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet with or without anthracycline (epirubicin or 
CHMP assessment report

doxorubicin) for unresectable or metastatic disease]; and the reproductive status of female and male 
patients (female patients were surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or compliant with a highly effective 
contraceptive method (failure rate <1%) during and for 12 weeks after the treatment period; male 
patients were surgically sterile or compliant with a highly effective contraceptive regimen during and for 
6 months after the treatment period. In addition, the frequency of radiographic assessments and the 
IDMC evaluations of safety data have been clarified. 
Amendment 3 (dated 08 October 2012):The important changes included additional clarification of 
coagulation parameters in the inclusion/exclusion criteria; infusion times for study treatment; 
ramucirumab dose based on patient’s body weight; complaint handling and dose modifications of 
investigational drug in response to Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs.

Other secondary endpoints 
The ORR in the ramucirumab arm plus paclitaxel was 27.9% (95% CI: 23.3, 33.0) versus 16.1 % (95% 
CI: 12.6, 20.4) in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm ((Odds ratio 2.140; 95% CI: 1.499, 3.160; p=0.0001). 
More patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm had improved or stable EORTC QLQ-C30 Global 
Health status compared to the placebo plus paclitaxel arm (Table 21) at each visit during the treatment.  
In contrast, a higher proportion in the placebo+paclitaxel arm had a stable or improved global health 
status by the end of treatment. The time to deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales was better in the 
ramucirumab+paclitaxel arm for all subscales except for diarrhea (data not shown).

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Ramucirumab+paclitaxel combination therapy 
RAINBOW, a global, randomised, double-blind, study of Cyramza plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus 
paclitaxel, was conducted in 665 patients with locally recurrent and unresectable or metastatic gastric 
cancer (including GEJ adenocarcinoma) following platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-containing 
chemotherapy, with or without anthracycline (see SmPC, section 5.1).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 65/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive Cyramza plus paclitaxel (n=330) or placebo plus 
paclitaxel (n=335). Randomisation was stratified by geographic region, time to progression from the start 
of first-line therapy (<6 months versus ≥ 6 months) and disease measurability (see SmPC, section 5.1). 
No notable inbalances in pretreatment characteristics were observed between the two treatment groups. 
Ramucirumab monotherapy 
REGARD, a multinational, randomised, double-blind study of Cyramza plus BSC versus placebo plus BSC, 
was conducted in 355 patients with locally recurrent and unresectable, or metastatic gastric cancer 
(including GEJ adenocarcinoma) following platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy (see 
SmPC, section 5.1).   
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive an intravenous infusion of Cyramza 8 mg/kg (n= 238) 
or placebo (n= 117) every 2 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by weight loss over the prior 3 months 
(≥  10% versus < 10%), geographic region, and location of the primary tumour (gastric versus GEJ) (see 
SmPC, section 5.1).  Although these stratification factors are considered acceptable, it is noted that no 
stratification was applied by VEGFR2 expression in tumours, thus precluding the possible finding of 
differential effects by VEGFR2 expression. 
Randomization resulted in several imbalances, patients in the ramucirumab arm presenting with a more 
favourable distribution of several baseline characteristics known to be of prognostic value (lower no. of 
metastases, higher proportion of patients with a progression free interval≥6 months, higher proportion of 
patients receiving chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting, higher proportion of patients with tumours of 
intestinal type). The applicant conducted a number of sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of the 
observed imbalances of prognostic factors. In all sensitivity analyses, a significant effect on overall 
survival remained, and the effect size did not change notably.  
Selection of the 8 mg/kg dose every other week for the monotherapy treatment may not be optimal since 
a higher dose of ramucirumab in monotherapy may be more efficacious while remaining tolerable. There 
may be an opportunity to further optimise the benefit/risk profile in the monotherapy setting given the 
exposure-efficacy relationship and overall safety profile observed in the REGARD study. Given the mild 
safety profile of ramucirumab in the monotherapy, and the considerable higher MTD of 13 mg/kg QW, 
exploration of an alternative dosing regimen is warranted. To further investigate this, the Applicant will 
submit the results of a dose-response study (see conclusions on clinical efficacy). 
After first-line treatment of gastric cancer, no second-line treatment for metastatic gastric cancer had 
been approved in Europe at the time of conducting the studies. The comparators used in the studies are 
considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Ramucirumab+paclitaxel combination therapy 
In the RAINBOW study, ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel reduced the risk of death in this 
population by 19% (HR = 0.807; 95% CI: 0.678, 0.962; p=0.0169), with a 2.4 months longer median 
survival in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm (9.6 versus 7.4 months). The effect of 
ramucirumab+paclitaxel was apparent in all pre-specified subgroups, except for the subgroup of patients 
with non-measurable disease.    
In addition, in contrast to region 1 (Western population), no beneficial effect of adding ramucirumab to 
paclitaxel was observed in region 3 (HR 0.986; CI 0.727-1.337). This may be related to the higher use of 
PDT in region 3 (Asia). A notably higher percentage of patients in Region 3 (67.3%) received PDT 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 66/102 
 
 
 
  
 
compared with Region 1 (37.2%). This higher use of PDT is likely to have contributed to the longer 
median survival time in Region 3 in the control arm (10.5 months compared with 5.6 months in Region 1, 
in the control arm). 
Treatment with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death 
(HR = 0.635; 95% CI: 0.536, 0.752; p<0.0001), with a 1.5 months longer median PFS in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared with the placebo plus paclitaxel arm (4.4 months vs. 2.9 
months). The robustness of the main PFS analysis results was supported by pre-specified sensitivity 
analyses, as demonstrated by consistent HRs between 0.599 and 0.649 with p<0.0001. In all subgroups 
the stratified HR numerically favoured the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm, except for the subgroup of 
patients with weight loss greater than or equal to 10% in the 3 months prior to randomization.  
Objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) was significantly improved in 
patients receiving Cyramza plus paclitaxel compared with those receiving placebo plus paclitaxel (Odds 
ratio 2.140; 95% CI: 1.499 to 3.160; p=0.0001). The ORR in the Cyramza plus paclitaxel arm was 27.9% 
and in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm was 16.1% (SmPC, section 5.1). 
More patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm had improved or stable EORTC QLQ-C30 Global 
Health status compared to the placebo plus paclitaxel arm at each visit during the treatment however a 
higher proportion in the placebo+paclitaxel arm had a stable or improved global health status by the end 
of treatment.  
Ramucirumab monotherapy 
In the pivotal study REGARD, ramucirumab as single-agent was associated with a HR  for OS of 0.776 
(95% CI [0.603; 0.998]; p=0.0473), with 5.3 months of median OS in the ramucirumab arm compared 
to 3.8 months in the placebo arm.   
During the initial evaluation, the CHMP raised a major objection about the differential OS outcome: the 
benefit on OS was most pronounced in region 2 (Latin America and Middle East (HR: region 1: 0.896; 
region 2: 0.464; region 3: 0.694)). The higher use of PDT in the ramucirumab arm (25.5%) in region 2 
compared to the placebo arm (17.2%) was unexpected when considering absence of efficacy in the 
placebo arm and not in line with the distribution of PDT in the other regions. In response, the applicant 
argued that the majority of patients in the REGARD study (67.3%) did not receive PDT and that patients 
who did receive PDT in region 2 only amounted to 19 patients.  A post hoc subgroup analysis by PDT use 
was conducted, showing a significant result in patients not receiving PDT, but not in patients receiving 
PDT. The CHMP acknowledged that is not possible to disentangle the effects of better prognosis in patients 
receiving post discontinuation therapy (PDT) from the possible effects of PDT on survival. The observed 
OS effects seen in RAINBOW study in region 1 (HR 0.726) and the poor relative results in region 3 (HR 
0.986) could be related to the more frequent use of PDT in region 3 (67% vs. 47%), but is more likely to 
reflect better prognosis, as the median OS is 3.5 months longer in region 3 than in region 1 (12.1 vs 8.6 
months). In the REGARD study the opposite OS results in region 1 (HR 0.896) vs. region 2 (HR 0.464), 
could reflect the more frequent use of PDT in region 1 (32.1%), but more likely better prognosis. 
Therefore this deviant distribution of PDT could be explained by a worse clinical condition of patients in the 
placebo group. However, based on the larger effect size observed in the RAINBOW study, ramucirumab 
monotherapy should be indicated for patients for whom treatment with ramucirumab in combination with 
paclitaxel is not appropriate (see discussion on benefit-risk).  
Inconsistency was also observed regarding gender (ramucirumab effective in men, but potentially 
detrimental in women) and histological subtype (large effect in diffuse type, no effect in intestinal or 
unknown subtype). A potential pathophysiological mechanism responsible for this inconsistency is not 
known. The influence of expression of VEGFR-2 and other biomarkers was not investigated. Therefore, it 
is unknown whether the observed inconsistency is attributable to differences in expression between the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 67/102 
 
 
  
 
two treatment arms. The CHMP recommended the applicant to submit the assay results for VEGF-C and 
VEGF-D from the RAINBOW study which includes correlations with efficacy measures (if applicable) by the 
end of 2Q 2015.  The RAINBOW study results for sVEGFR2 will be submitted by the end of 4Q 2015, when 
the assay is validated. 
In general, ramucirumab was not associated with a deterioration of QoL. However, the extent of QoL data 
was limited by the rapid progression characteristic of advanced, treatment-resistant gastric cancer and by 
the absence of QoL evaluation at the end of therapy.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The RAINBOW study has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of the combination of 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel in terms of the primary endpoint OS, compared to placebo plus paxlitaxel  in 
patients with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with disease 
progression after prior platinum and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. The REGARD study has provided 
convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of the monotherapy in terms of the primary endpoint OS, 
compared to placebo in patients with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma with disease progression after prior platinum and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for 
whom treatment in combination with paclitaxel is not appropriate.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to the dosing regimen for 
the monotherapy setting: 
The MAH shall submit results from the randomised dose ranging pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety study 
of ramucirumab monotherapy (14T-MC-JVDB). This phase 2 study will evaluate the PK and safety of 
various schedules of ramucirumab, including an exploration of higher doses than the approved dose of 
8mg/kg every 2 weeks in second line gastric adenocarcinoma.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Study I4T-IE-JVBD (REGARD) 
Patient exposure 
Of 355 randomized patients, 351 received at least 1 dose of study therapy, including 236 in the 
ramucirumab group and 115 in the placebo group. Four patients were randomized and not treated (2 in 
each arm). One of these 4 died subsequent to randomization and prior to administration of the first dose; 
the other 3 experienced symptoms that made them unsuitable for dosing in the opinion of the investigator 
(performance status decline, brain metastases, and laboratory abnormalities, respectively). 
Patients continued treatment until there was evidence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. 
The ramucirumab dose regimen used in REGARD was 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks. 
The median duration of therapy was 8 weeks for the ramucirumab arm (median 4 cycles) and 6 weeks for 
the placebo arm (median 3 cycles) (Table 26). The median relative dose intensity was 99.6% for the 
ramucirumab arm, with 91.5% of patients receiving doses ≥ 90% of the 8 mg/kg protocol-stipulated dose 
level. The cumulative number of patient-years exposure was 57.5 and 17.4 years for ramucirumab and 
placebo respectively. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 68/102 
 
 
  
 
Table 26 Extent of exposure in the REGARD study (Safety Population) 
More patients on the ramucirumab arm (versus the placebo arm) had any dose delay ≥ 7 days (5.1% vs. 
1.7%), dose omitted (20.3% vs. 10.4%), infusion rate modification (6.4% vs. 1.7%), or infusion 
interruption (1.3% vs. 0%). Three patients in the ramucirumab arm (1.3 %) and 1 patient (0.9%) in the 
placebo arm required dose reductions, each due to an AE. The most frequent TEAEs leading to dose 
modification and delays were asthenia (n = 5; 2.1%), abdominal pain (n = 4; 1.7%), and anaemia (n = 
3; 1.3%) in the ramucirumab arm, and asthenia and vomiting (each, n = 2; 1.7%) in the placebo arm. 
Adverse events 
An overview of treatment-emergent adverse events is presented in table 27. 
Table 27 Overview of treatment-emergent adverse events in the REGARD study 
A total of 223 patients in the ramucirumab group (94.5%) and 101 patients in the placebo group (87.8%) 
experienced at least 1 TEAE. 
Preferred terms for very common AEs (≥ 10% incidence) observed at a higher incidence among patients 
receiving ramucirumab than among patients receiving placebo included hypertension (15.3% vs. 7.8%), 
diarrhoea (14.4% vs. 8.7%), and abdominal pain upper (11.4% vs. 4.3%). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 69/102 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Preferred terms for any-grade AEs (≥ 5% and < 10% incidence) observed with at least twice the 
incidence rate among patients receiving ramucirumab than among patients receiving placebo were 
headache (9.3% vs. 3.5%) and hyponatremia (5.5% vs. 1.7%). 
Preferred terms for less common AEs (≥1% and <5% incidence) observed with at least twice the 
incidence rate among patients receiving ramucirumab than among patients receiving placebo included 
epistaxis (4.7% vs. 0.9%), pain (4.2% vs. 0.9%), neutropenia (3.8% vs. 0.9%), mucosal inflammation 
(3.8% vs. 0.9%), rash (3.8% vs. 0.9%), and intestinal obstruction (2.1% vs. 0%). 
The relationship between TEAES and exposure to ramucirumab was determined by the investigator and 
were reported at a similar rate in both arms (53.0% in the ramucirumab arm and 50.4% in the placebo 
arm). 
The frequency of individual Grade ≥3 TEAE was <10% for all events in both ramucirumab and placebo 
group. The overall incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was 56.8% in the ramucirumab arm and 58.3 % placebo 
arms. The most common Grade ≥3 TEAE occurred at 7.2% in the ramucirumab arm and 2.6 % in the 
placebo arm; no Grade >3 hypertension was observed.  
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) 
Events meeting either of the below criteria in REGARD were evaluated as potential ADRs (‘‘Incidence’’ 
means the percentage of patients experiencing the event): 
- The ramucirumab incidence was ≥ 10% AND the ramucirumab incidence was greater than or equal to 
the placebo incidence. 
- The ramucirumab incidence was between 1% and 10%, AND ramucirumab incidence was ≥ 2 times the 
placebo incidence, AND the number of patients experiencing the event on the ramucirumab arm was ≥
4.  
Clinically relevant ADRs reported in ≥ 1% and < 5% of the ramucirumab treated patients in REGARD 
were: neutropenia, arterial thromboembolic events, intestinal obstruction, epistaxis and rash (see Table 
28).

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
AEs of special interest (AESI) included  infusion related reactions (IRRs), hypertension, proteinuria, 
venous and arterial thromboembolic events, bleeding/haemorrhagic events, GI perforation, congestive 
heart failure, wound-healing complications, fistula, liver failure / liver injury and reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). 
Infusion related reactions (IRRs) 
IRRs were observed in 11.5% of patients in the ramucirumab phase II trials. In the phase III pivotal trial 
IRRs one patient with grade 1 IRR in the ramucirumab arm and 2 patients in the placebo arm were 
observed. Six patients (JVBO: 2 [4.0%], JVBQ: 4 [9.5%]) experienced Grade 3 IRR events and 1 (2.0%) 
patient in Study JVBO experienced a Grade 4 IRR event. The majority of events occurred during or 
following a first or second ramucirumab infusion. Symptoms included rigors/tremors, back-pain/spasms, 
chest pain and/or tightness, chills, flushing, dyspnoea, wheezing, hypoxia, and paraesthesia. In severe 
cases symptoms included bronchospasm, supraventricular tachycardia, and hypotension. 
Hypertension 
In the pivotal phase III study, hypertension reported as follows: all grades at 16.8% and grade 3 at 7.6% 
of patients in the ramucirumab arm. Antihypertensive therapy was administered to patients as needed 
throughout the study. Four patients required dose delay and/or modification for hypertension. 
Subjects in the phase II single agent ramucirumab studies experienced hypertension as follows: there 
were 17 patients with Grade 3 events (JVBO: 7 [14.0%], JVBP: 3 [7.7%], JVBQ: 5 [11.9%], JVBR: 2 
[3.3%]) and 2 patients with Grade ≥4 events (JVBP: 1 [2.6%], JVBQ: 1 [2.4%]). Two patients 
experienced a grade 4 hypertension event that resulted in discontinuation of ramucirumab.  
Proteinuria 
In the pivotal study, proteinuria was observed at 3.0% of patients treated with ramucirumab. One patient 
experienced grade 3 proteinuria.

In the 4 different phase II studies, 11.0% of patients experienced events of proteinuria that were 
considered at least possibly related to ramucirumab (as assessed by the investigator); this includes 2 
patients with grade 3 proteinuria in studies JVBO and JVBQ, respectively, and 1 patient with a Grade 4 
event of proteinuria in Study JVBO that resulted in discontinuation of ramucirumab. 
Thromboembolic events 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) were observed in 1.7% (all grades) of patients treated with 
ramicurimuab in the pivotal trial. Of these four patients, one experienced a grade 4 and two experienced 
a grade 5 thromboembolic event, of which two were possibly attributed to exposure to ramucirumab. A 
total of seven patients across 3 of the single-agent ramucirumab arms phase II experienced ATEs. Grade 
3 ATE in two patients and grade 4 ATE in two patients enrolled in the melanoma study were considered 
related to ramucirumab. 
In the phase III REGARD trial venous thrombo-embolic events were observed in 3.8% of patients treated 
with ramicurimuab. In the ramucirumab arm, there were 3 VTEs of Grade 3 (all events of pulmonary 
embolism). Across the phase II studies, two patients experienced a grade 3 VTE. 
Bleeding/haemorrhage events 
In the REGARD study, the incidence of bleeding events (any grade) was 12.7% in the ramucirumab arm. 
Epistaxis was the most frequently reported bleeding event in the ramucirumab arm (4.7%, vs. 0.9% in 
the placebo arm). The incidence of severe bleeding was 3.4%. 
Across the 4 phase II studies, bleeding was reported in 30.4% patients receiving single-agent 
ramucirumab arms. The majority of events were Grade 1-2, and 3 patients in the HCC trial experienced 
grade 3-4 events and 3 patients in ovarian cancer experienced Grade 3 events. Gastrointestinal bleeding 
was most frequently observed in the HCC trial (all grades: 9.4; grade 3 4.8 and grade 4: 2.4%). 
Gastrointestinal perforation 
Two fatal cases in the ramucirumab were reported in the REGARD study. In the phase II ovarian cancer 
trial, two patients experienced grade 3 and grade 4-5 GI perforation respectively. 
Congestive heart failure 
In the pivotal REGARD III study, one case of grade 1 heart failure was observed in the ramucirumab arm, 
more than 30 days after the first dose of ramucirumab was administered. One patient in the phase II 
study JVBP experienced a Grade 2 event of congestive heart failure (left ventricular systolic dysfunction), 
which was possible related to ramucirumab.  
Wound-healing complications 
No wound-healing complications were observed in either the REGARD or in phase II single-agent 
ramucirumab trials. 
Fistula 
One grade 3 enterocutaneous fistula was observed in the ramucirumab arm of the REGARD trial and was 
possibly related to ramucirumab.  
In phase II study JVBR (ovarian cancer), one grade1 anal fistula was observed, which resolved during 
continuation of ramucirumab. One grade 4 genital fistula was observed 25 days after the last dose of 
ramucirumab in a patient with progression of disease and was not considered related to the study drug. 
Liver failure, liver injury 
Liver toxicity is described under Laboratory findings section below.

Reversible posterior leuko-encephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) 
In the pivotal phase III REGARD trial and across the 4 supportive phase 2 single-agent ramucirumab 
studies, no events of RPLS were observed. 
QTc prolongation 
Study JVBK was a multicenter, open-label, evaluated the relationship between ramucirumab 
(monotherapy 10mg/kg Q 3 weeks for 9 weeks) and corrected QT interval changes in patients with 
advanced cancer (n=68).  
During Cycle 3 the upper limit of the 2-sided 90% CI of the least square means of change from baseline 
for QTcF was less than 10 msec at all postdose time points.  Categorical outlier analysis for Cycle 3 
showed 2 patients (3 time points) with a QTcF value >450 msec and ≤ 480 msec. No patient had a QTcF 
value >480 msec or QT, QTcB, or QTcF value ≥ 500 msec in this population. 
An increase in QTcF of >30 msec and ≤ 60 msec was seen in 3 patients (5 time points) in Cycle 3 and an 
increase of >60 msec was observed in one patient. This patient had the shortest baseline QTcF value (347 
msec) among all patients participating in the study. The absolute QTcF values at these visits were 412 
msec at Cycle 3, Day 1/Week 1, 03:15 hour and 431 msec at Cycle 3, Day 1/Week 1, 04:15 hour. None 
of these QTc values exceeded 450 msec.

Deaths 
Among the 78 patients who died while on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study therapy, 
a total of 37 died due to an AE [22 (9.3%) in the ramucirumab arm and 15 (13.0%) in the placebo arm]. 
Five such deaths in the ramucirumab arm (2.1%) and 2 deaths in the placebo arm (1.7%) were 
attributable to AEs considered by the investigator related to study therapy. Three patients in the 
ramucirumab arm (and none in the placebo arm) died due to an AE more than 30 days after the last dose 
of study therapy; in 2 of the 3 cases the AE that resulted in death developed within 30 days after the last 
dose of study therapy, but none of the events was considered related to study therapy by the investigator. 
In addition to the total of 40 patients who died due to an AE, 16 patients (11 in the ramucirumab arm and 
5 in the placebo arm) had TEAEs with an outcome of death (where the primary cause of death was not the 
adverse event). These were all cases in which disease progression, multi-organ failure, or symptomatic 
deterioration was recorded as AEs. One of these cases (in the ramucirumab arm) was reported as related 
to study therapy by the investigator; the event was disease progression. TEAEs with a worst grade of 
Grade 4 occurred in 16 (6.8%) of ramucirumab-treated patients and 9 (7.8%) of placebo-treated 
patients. TEAEs with a worst grade of Grade 5 (death) occurred in 35 (14.8%) of ramucirumab-treated 
patients and 19 (16.5%) of placebo-treated patients. 
Table 31 Summary of deaths-REGARD Study 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical liver toxicity and abnormal laboratory findings, was reported in 10.2% of patients treated with 
ramucirumab in the pivotal REGARD study (see Table 32). All liver failure / liver injury events considered 
at least possibly related to study drug.

Table 32 Liver Failure/Liver Injury REGARD Safety Population 
In the single-arm ramucirumab phase II studies, there were 3 fatal cases of liver failure, all related to the 
underlying disease. Liver events were highest in the HCC JVBQ study (all grades 26.2%; grade 3 or 
higher: 16.7%) and in the ovarian cancer JVBO phase II study (15.0% all grades; 6.7% grade 3 or 
higher). 
In the pivotal phase III REGARD study, neutropenia was observed with a higher any-grade (3.8 vs 0.8%) 
and Grade ≥3 (0.9 and 0%) incidence in the ramucirumab arm compared with the placebo arm 
respectively. 
Any grade hyponatraemia was more frequently observed in the ramucirumab group (5.5%) compared to 
the placebo group (1.7%), even like grade 3 hyponatraemia events (3.4 vs 0.9%) 
Hypokalaemia was observed with a higher Grade ≥3 incidence in the ramucirumab arm (2.1%) compared 
with the placebo arm (0.9%). However, laboratory shift tables for potassium did not indicate any 
imbalance between treatment arms. 
There were no differences observed in the occurrence of hypoalbumenia in the ramucirumab (5.1%) vs. 
the placebo group (5.2%). 
Safety in special populations 
No studies were conducted.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific safety issues related to possible drug-drug interaction were identified (see also discussion on 
clinical pharmacology).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Twenty-five subjects in the ramucirumab group (10.5%) of the pivotal REGARD study compared to 7 
(6.0%) subjects in the placebo arm discontinued treatment due to AEs. Eleven of these discontinuations 
in the ramucirumab and 2 in the placebo group were considered at least possibly related to treatment by 
the investigator.  
In the 4 supportive Phase 2 single-agent ramucirumab studies, a total of 32 (16.8%) patients across the 
studies experienced at least 1 TEAE that led to discontinuation of study drug and included IRR (observed 
in 5 patients across 2 studies), proteinuria (1 patient each in 3 studies), GI haemorrhage (2 patients in 1 
study), intestinal perforation (2 patients in 1 study), and hypertension (1 patient each in 2 studies).

Study I4T-IE-JVBE (RAINBOW) 
Patient exposure 
The median duration of therapy in the RAINBOW study was 18.9 weeks for the ramucirumab plus 
paclitaxel arm and 12.1 weeks for the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Of the 665 patients randomized to 
treatment, 656 received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The median relative dose intensity of paclitaxel was 87.7% in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm 
compared to 93.2% in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm and the median cumulative dose of ramucirumab 
in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm was 70.0 mg/kg compared to 49.0 mg/kg of placebo in the 
placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm had a longer median 
duration of treatment. 
In the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm 48.9% of patients had dose delays compared to 28.0% of 
patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm.  For the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm, the percentage of 
dose delays was 40.1% for ramucirumab and 38.8% for paclitaxel.  A higher percentage of patients had 
dose modifications of any study drug in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm than in the placebo plus 
paclitaxel arm.  Irrespective of treatment arm, dose modifications of any study drug were primarily due 
to AEs. 
Dose level reductions and dose omissions occurred more frequently in the ramucirumab arm compared to 
the placebo arm (25.4% versus 7.9% and 50.2% versus 32.8% respectively).

Table 34 Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in the RAINBOW study 
Treatment-emergent AE was observed in 99.1% in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm and in 97.9% in 
the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. A Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs was observed in 81.7% of patients in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared to 62.6% of patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. In the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm 27.8% of patients discontinued treatment compared to 23.1% of 
patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Ramucirumab discontinuation was observed in 20.8% of 
patients and placebo discontinuation was observed in 20.7% due to TEAEs.   
The most frequently reported TEAEs, by preferred terms (at least 20% incidence, regardless of grade), 
observed at a higher incidence (with at least 5 percentage point difference) in the ramucirumab plus 
paclitaxel arm than in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm were neutropenia (54.4% vs. 31.0%), decreased 
appetite (40.1% vs. 31.9%), fatigue (39.8% vs.32.2%), leukopenia (33.9% vs. 21.0%), diarrhea 
(32.4% vs. 23.1%), abdominal pain (30.9% vs. 20.4%), epistaxis (30.6% vs. 7.0%), vomiting (26.9% 
vs. 20.7%), oedema peripheral (25.1% vs. 13.7%), hypertension (23.9% vs. 4.9%), and asthenia 
(21.1% vs. 13.7%). 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurring in more than 10% of patients in either arm were neutropenia, anemia, 
leukopenia, hypertension, and malignant neoplasm progression. 
Independent of treatment arm, the incidence any-grade neutropenia was higher in Asian patients (77.1% 
versus 44.5%) than in White patients (43.7% versus 23.5%), whereas the incidence of Grade 3 
neutropenia in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm was similar in Asian (22.0% versus 21.8%) and 
White patients (21.8% versus 11.2%).The incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia was higher in Asian patients 
(37.6% versus 4.2%) than in White patients (9.7% versus 3.1%) in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm. 
The incidences of neutropenic infectious complications and febrile neutropenia were similar between 
White and Asian patients [febrile neutropenia 4 (3.7%) versus (3.4%)]. Thrombocytopenia of any grade 
was observed in 13.1% of the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm patients compared to 6.1% of placebo 
plus paclitaxel arm patients.   
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) 
Events meeting either of the below criteria in RAINBOW were evaluated as potential ADRs for 
ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer: 
- The AE incidence in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm was ≥ 10% AND the ramucirumab plus 
paclitaxel incidence was ≥  the placebo plus paclitaxel incidence. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 79/102 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
- The AE incidence in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm was between 1% and 10%, AND ramucirumab 
plus paclitaxel incidence was ≥ 2 times the placebo plus paclitaxel incidence, AND the number of patients 
experiencing the event on the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm was ≥ 4.  
The most common adverse reactions observed in ramucirumab-treated patients are: fatigue/asthenia, 
neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhoea, epistaxis, and hypertension (SmPC, section 4.8). An overview of 
Adverse Drug Reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients is presented in Table 35.

study) 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 80/102 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) included infusion related reactions (IRR), hypertension, 
proteinuria, arterial and venous thromboembolic events, bleeding/haermorrhagic events, GI perforation, 
and congestive heart failure, wound healing complications, fistula, liver failure/liver injury and reversible 
posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS).  
Infusion related reactions (IRR) 
Any-grade IRR was reported for 5.8% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm and 3.6% of 
patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Grade 3 IRR events were experienced by 0.6% of patients in 
the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm; there was no Grade 3 IRR events observed in the placebo plus 
paclitaxel arm. There was no Grade 4 or Grade 5 IRR events observed in either treatment arm. In the 
Phase 2 combination studies including ramucirumab plus paclitaxel, IRRs were observed in Study JVBJ 
but not in Study JVCA. Of 40 patients in Study JVBJ, 9 (22.5%) had IRRs. The majority of these events 
were Grade 1 (n=3) or Grade 2 (n=4). One patient (2.5%) had a Grade 3 IRR and 1 patient (2.5%) had 
a Grade 4 anaphylactic reaction that, per investigator assessment, was related to carboplatin. 
The majority of events occurred during or following a first or second ramucirumab infusion. Symptoms 
included rigors/tremors, back-pain/spasms, chest pain and/or tightness, chills, flushing, dyspnoea, 
wheezing, hypoxia, and paraesthesia. In severe cases symptoms included bronchospasm, 
supraventricular tachycardia, and hypotension (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Hypertension 
Hypertension of any grade was observed in 25.1% of patients receiving ramucirumab plus paclitaxel and 
in 5.8% of patients receiving placebo plus paclitaxel. The incidence of Grade 3 hypertension was observed 
in 14.7% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm and in 2.7% of patients in placebo plus 
paclitaxel arm. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 events in either arm. Hypertension resulted in the 
discontinuation of any study drug for 0.6% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm, a 
ramucirumab dose omission for 1.2% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm and paclitaxel 
dose omission for 0.6% ofv patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm. In the Phase 2 combination 
studies including ramucirumab plus paclitaxel, hypertensive events were observed in two studies. In 
Study JVBJ patients received ramucirumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 6 (15%) of 40 patients had 
hypertensive events of all grades. the majority being grade 1 or 2. One patient (2.6%) had a Grade 3 
hypertensive event. In Study JVCA patients received ramucirumab plus paclitaxel, 5 (16.1%) of 31 
patients had hypertensive events of all grades with the majority being Grade 1 or Grade 2. Two (6.5%) 
patients had a Grade 3 hypertensive event. No Grade 4 or Grade 5 hypertensive events were reported in 
either Study JVBJ or Study JVCA.  
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria of any grade occurred in 16.8% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared 
to 6.1% in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm.  Grade 3 proteinuria was observed in 1.2% of patients in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared to 0 patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. A total of 
1.2% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm experienced proteinuria that led to the 
discontinuation of any study therapy. In Study JVBJ, 4 patients (10%) out of 40 had proteinuria (3 Grade 
1 proteinuria and 1 Grade 2 proteinuria). Per investigator assessment, 3 events were related to 
ramucirumab. Information on relationship between TEAE and chemotherapy was not collected on the 
JVBJ TEAE CRF. In Study JVCA, no patients had proteinuria of any grade. 
Thromboembolic events 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 81/102 
 
 
  
 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) of any grade were observed in 1.8% of patients in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared to 1.5% in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Grade 3 ATE was 
observed in 0.3% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared to 0.6% in the placebo 
plus paclitaxel arm. Grade 4 ATEs were observed in 0.3% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel 
arm. There were no grade 5 ATEs reported in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm. In phase II Study 
JVBJ, 2 (5%) of 40 patients had ATEs, none of which were Grade ≥3. In 1 case, the ATE was a Grade 2 
cerebral ischemia event, assessed by investigator as possibly related to ramucirumab. The other ATE was 
a Grade 1 angina pectoris event, assessed by investigator as unrelated to ramucirumab. In Study JVCA, 
no patients had an ATE of any grade. 
Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) occurred in 4.0% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel 
arm and in 5.5% of patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Grade 3 VTEs were observed in 2.1% of 
patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm and in 2.4% of patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel 
arm. No Grade 4 VTEs occurred in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm. Grade 5 was observed in 0.3% 
of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel. In Study JVBJ, 2 (5%) of 40 patients had VTEs. Both 
patients in Study JVBJ with VTEs had Grade 4 pulmonary embolism. Per investigator assessment, both 
events were possibly related to ramucirumab. In Study JVCA, 1 (3.2%) of 31 patients had a VTE, which 
was a Grade 3 pulmonary embolism. Per investigator assessment, the event was possibly related to 
ramucirumab. The patient was hospitalized. The event was considered ongoing at PDBL date. No action 
was taken with respect to ramucirumab administration. 
Bleeding/haemorrhage events 
The incidence of bleeding events of any grade was observed in 41.9% of patients in the ramucirumab plus 
paclitaxel arm compared to 17.9% of patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Epistaxis was the most 
frequently reported bleeding event of bleeding in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm (30.6% vs. 7.0% 
in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm). The incidence of severe bleeding events (Grade ≥3) was observed in 
4.3% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm and in 2.4% of patients in the placebo plus 
paclitaxel arm. Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most frequently observed bleeding event (all grade GI 
bleeding events 10.1% in ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm patients compared to 6.1% in the placebo plus 
paclitaxel arm patients). In Study JVBJ, 18 (45%) of 40 patients had bleeding/haemorrhage events that 
included epistaxis, gingival bleeding, haemoptysis, contusion, blood blister, conjunctival hemorrhage, 
diarrhea haemorrhagic, hematemesis, petechiae, and vessel puncture site hematoma. The majority of 
these bleeding/haemorrhage events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 epistaxis (12 of 18 patients with bleeding 
events). No bleeding/haemorrhage events were Grade ≥3. Per investigator assessment, 10 of the 18 
bleeding/haemorrhage events in Study JVBJ were possibly related to ramucirumab. One patient in Study 
JVBJ had a GI haemorrhage event reported as Grade 1 diarrhea haemorrhage, assessed by investigator 
as unrelated to ramucirumab. In Study JVCA, 11 (35.5%) of 31 patients had bleeding/haemorrhage 
events that included epistaxis, haemoptysis, and contusion. The vast majority of these 
bleeding/haemorrhage events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 epistaxis (10 of 11 patients with bleeding events). 
No bleeding/haemorrhage events were Grade ≥3. Per investigator assessment, 10 of the 11 
bleeding/haemorrhage events in Study JVCA were possibly related to ramucirumab. No 
bleeding/haemorrhage events were Grade ≥3 in study JVCA.  
Gastrointestinal perforation 
Any grade gastrointestinal perforation (GI) event was observed in 1.2% of patients in the ramucirumab 
plus paclitaxel arm and in 0.3% of patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. In the Phase 2 combination 
studies including ramucirumab plus paclitaxel, no GI perforation events were observed. 
Congestive Heart Failure     
CHMP assessment report

All grades Congestive heart failure (CHF) events were observed in 2.4% of patients in the ramucirumab 
plus paclitaxel arm compared to 1.2% of patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Grade 3 CHF was 
observed in 0.6% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared to 0.3% of patients in the 
placebo plus paclitaxel arm. In the Phase 2 combination studies (JVBJ and JVCA) including ramucirumab 
plus paclitaxel, no CHF events occurred. 
Wound healing complications

Fistula 
In RAINBOW and in the Phase 2 combination studies including ramucirumab plus paclitaxel, no fistula 
events occurred. 
Liver failure, liver injury 
In RAINBOW study, the incidence of any-grade liver failure / liver injury events, including clinical and 
laboratory events, in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm was 16.5% ( see Laboratory findings section 
below). 
In study JVBJ no patient had liver failure/liver injury events. In Study JVCA, 3 (9.7%) patients had liver 
failure/liver injury events identified by laboratory terms (without clinical symptoms) of ALT increased and 
AST increased, all of which were Grade 1. Per investigator assessment, 3 of the 4 laboratory term events 
(1 ALT increased and 2 AST increased) were possibly related to ramucirumab. 
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) 
In RAINBOW and in the Phase 2 combination studies including ramucirumab plus paclitaxel, no events of 
RPLS were observed.

plus Paclitaxel Arm, by MedDRA Preferred Term- RAINBOW Study 
Deaths 
Of the 89 patients who died while on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment, 25 
died due to an AE [11 (3.4%) in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm and 14 (4.3%) in the placebo plus 
paclitaxel arm]; 8% of the patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm died due to progressive 
disease compared to 11.6% of patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Additionally, 2 patients in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm and 1 patient in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm died due to an AE more 
than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. For all 3 patients, the onset of the AEs that resulted 
in death was within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. The AEs were malabsorption/anorexia 
and elevated serum creatinine/carbamid (urea) level from the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm, and 
paralytic ileus from the placebo plus paclitaxel treatment arm. Among these Grade 5 AEs that occurred 
more than 30 days after last dose of study treatment, only the AE of malabsorption was considered 
related to ramucirumab by the investigator.

In each arm, the same percentage of patients experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation (20.8% in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm versus 20.7% in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm). TEAEs were observed 
in 27.8% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared to 23.1% in the placebo plus 
paclitaxel arm. 
TEAEs leading to the discontinuation of ramucirumab or placebo, respectively, included malignant 
neoplasm progression (4.0% vs. 4.6%), fatigue (1.8% vs. 0.9%), general physical health deterioration 
(1.8% vs. 1.5%), ascites (1.2% vs. 0.6%), and proteinuria (1.2% vs. 0). The most frequent (at least 2% 
incidence in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm) TEAEs leading to the discontinuation of paclitaxel were 
neutropenia (4.0% vs. 0.3%), malignant neoplasm progression (3.4% vs. 4.6%), thrombocytopenia 
(2.8% vs. 0), and neuropathy peripheral (2.1% vs. 0.6%).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinically relevant ADRs reported in ≥  1% and < 5% of the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel-treated patients 
in RAINBOW were gastrointestinal perforation (1.2% ramucirumab plus paclitaxel versus 0.3% for 
placebo plus paclitaxel) and sepsis (3.1% ramucirumab plus paclitaxel versus 1.8% placebo plus 
paclitaxel) (see SmPC, section 4.8). 
Clinically relevant ADRs reported in ≥ 1% and < 5% of the ramucirumab treated patients in REGARD 
were: neutropenia, arterial thromboembolic events, intestinal obstruction, epistaxis, and rash (see 
SmPC, section 4.8). 
Clinically relevant reactions (including Grade ≥  3) associated with antiangiogenic therapy observed in 
ramucirumab-treated patients across clinical studies were: arterial thromboembolic events, 
infusion-related reactions and proteinuria (see SmPC, section 4.8).  
Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurring in more than 10% of patients in either arm were neutropenia, anaemia, 
leukopenia, hypertension, and malignant neoplasm progression. 
A similar percentage of patients in both treatment arms had any-grade TE-SAEs (46.8% [ramucirumab 
plus paclitaxel arm] versus 42.2% [placebo plus paclitaxel arm]), while a higher percentage of patients in 
the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm than in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm had Grade ≥ 3 TE-SAEs 
(42.5% versus 37.1%, respectively). 
The most frequently reported TE-SAE with a higher incidence in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm 
(54.4%) was neutropenia .This event did not result in the death of any patient however it  did not result 
in an increased incidence of neutropenic fever which was low and similar in both treatments. Neutropenia 
is considered an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015

Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were reported in clinical studies with ramucirumab. The infusion rate of 
ramucirumab should be reduced by 50 % for the duration of the infusion and all subsequent infusions if 
the patient experiences a grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reaction. Ramucirumab should be immediately and 
permanently discontinued in the event of a grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reaction (see SmPC, section 4.2). 
Infusion-related reactions are considered an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
An increased incidence of severe hypertension was reported in patients receiving ramucirumab as 
compared to placebo. In most cases hypertension was managed using standard antihypertensive 
treatment. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension were excluded from the trials: ramucirumab 
treatment should not be initiated in such patients until and unless their pre-existing hypertension is 
controlled. Patients who are treated with ramucirumab should have their blood pressure monitored. 
Ramucirumab should be temporarily discontinued for severe hypertension until controlled with medical 
management. Ramucirumab should be permanently discontinued if medically significant hypertension 
cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy (see SmPC, sections 4.2 and 4.4). In general 
hypertension could be adequately managed with concurrent use of (combinational) antihypertensives. 
Hypertension is considered an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
The incidence of proteinuria is low except for Asian patients in whom a higher incidence was observed, 
especially when ramucirumab was combined with paclitaxel. However, the clinical relevance of 
proteinuria in patients with a poor prognosis is questionable.  Proteinuria was not related to arterial 
hypertension neither to the length of exposure to ramucirumab.   
Patients should be monitored for the development or worsening of proteinuria during ramucirumab 
therapy. If the urine protein is ≥ 2+ on a dipstick, a 24 hour urine collection should be performed. 
Ramucirumab therapy should be temporarily discontinued if the urine protein level is ≥ 2 g/24 hours. 
Once the urine protein level returns to <2 g/24 hours, treatment should be resumed at a reduced dose 
level (6 mg/kg every 2 weeks). A second dose reduction (to 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) is recommended if 
a urine protein level ≥ 2 g/24 hours reoccurs (see SmPC, sections 4.4 and 4.2). Ramucirumab therapy 
should be permanently discontinued if the urine protein level is >3 g/24 hours or in the event of nephrotic 
syndrome (see SmPC, section 4.2).  Proteinuria is considered an identified risk in the Risk Management 
Plan. 
The observed higher frequency of arterial thromboembolic events is in line with the pharmacological 
inhibition of VEGFR2 by ramucirumab. Discontinuation of ramucirumab has been advised in patients 
experiencing a severe ATE (see SmPC, section 4.4). Arterial thromboembolic events are considered an 
identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Ramucirumab is an antiangiogenic therapy and has the potential to increase the risk of severe bleeding. 
Ramucirumab should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience severe bleeding: NCI 
CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 bleeding (see SmPC, section 4.2). Blood counts and coagulation parameters should 
be monitored in patients with conditions predisposing to bleeding, and in those treated with 
anticoagulants or other concomitant medicinal products that increase the risk of bleeding. Severe 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, including fatal events, was reported in patients with gastric cancer treated 
with ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel (see SmPC, section 4.4). Bleeding/Haemorrhagic Events 
are considered an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
The occurrence of GI perforation is in line with the pharmacological inhibition of VEGFR2 by ramucirumab 
leading to inhibition of angiogenesis. Therefore, the two fatal cases of GI perforation in the ramucirumab 
arm are considered possibly related to the use of ramucirumab. Gastrointestinal perforation is considered 
an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Ramucirumab should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience gastrointestinal 
perforations (see SmPC, sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Although the overall observed frequency of fistulas was low in the REGARD and phase II trials is not 
increased for the ramucirumab arm compared to placebo, the occurrence of fistula might be in line with 
the pharmacological inhibition of VEGFR2 by ramucirumab leading to inhibition of angiogenesis, rendering 
tissues more susceptible for fistula formation. For several anti-antiangiogenic agents, GI perforation has 
been associated with longer term use of these agents. Since exposure to ramucirumab in the REGARD 
trial is only 8 weeks, exposure to ramucirumab in the REGARD study might have been too short for 
patients to develop this serious ADR and incidence of GI perforation might have been underestimated. 
Fistula formation is considered an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Patients may be at increased risk for the development of fistula when treated with Cyramza. 
Ramucirumab treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop fistula (see SmPC, sections 4.2 
and 4.4). 
In phase II JVBQ study among hepatocellular carcinoma patients, liver events were more common than 
in other patient populations. Therefore, pre-existing liver disease, like cirrhosis and/or hepatorenal 
syndrome (frequently observed in these patients), might negatively impact the safety of ramucirumab. 
Liver failure/liver injury is considered an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Ramucirumab should be used with caution in patients with severe liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or C), 
cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, clinically significant ascites due to cirrhosis, or hepatorenal 
syndrome. In these patients, ramucirumab should only be used if the potential benefits of treatment are 
judged to outweigh the potential risk of progressive hepatic failure (see SmPC, section 4.4).   
The impact of ramucirumab has not been evaluated in patients with serious or non-healing wounds. In a 
study conducted in animals, ramucirumab did not impair wound healing. However, since ramucirumab is 
an antiangiogenic therapy and may have the potential to adversely affect wound healing, ramucirumab 
treatment should be withheld for at least 4 weeks prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume 
ramucirumab following surgical intervention should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound 
healing (see section 4.4). If a patient develops wound healing complications during therapy, 
ramucirumab should be discontinued until the wound is fully healed (see section 4.2). Impaired wound 
healing is considered an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
In the pivotal REGARD study, one case of grade 1 CHF was observed in the ramucirumab arm, more than 
30 days after the first dose of ramucirumab was administered. One patient in the phase II study JVBP 
experienced a Grade 2 event of congestive heart failure (left ventricular systolic dysfunction), which was 
possible related to ramucirumab. All grades CHF events were observed in 2.4% of patients in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared to 1.2% of patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Grade 
3 CHF was observed in 0.6% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared to 0.3% of 
patients in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. Congestive heart failure is considered an identified risk in the 
Risk Management Plan. 
Anaemia has been reported with some anti-angiogenic agents and has been observed in ramucirumab 
studies, including some Grade 3 and Grade 4 events. Anaemia has been categorized as a potential risk 
(see Risk Management Plan). 
Abdominal pain is a very common symptom in gastric cancer patients.  Increased risk of abdominal pain 
has been associated with anti-angiogenic therapeutic agents.  The majority of events have been reported 
as Grade 1 or Grade 2.  Abdominal pain has been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk Management 
Plan). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 88/102 
 
 
  
 
Two cases of Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome have been reported in a blinded study.  
As study therapy remains blinded and the case swere confounded by combination therapy, including 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), for which RPLS is expected, the safety of study subjects is not considered to be 
affected by continuation of therapy with ramucirumab. Considering the potential severity of this rare 
usually reversible event, RPLS has been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Venous thrombo-embolic events (VTEs) were more frequently reported in the placebo (7.0%) than in the 
ramucirumab arm (3.8%) of the phase III REGARD trial. In the ramucirumab arm, there were 3 VTEs of 
Grade 3 (all events of pulmonary embolism). Across the phase II studies, two patients experienced a 
grade 3 VTE. In Rainbow study, VTEs occurred in 4.0% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel 
arm. Grade 3 VTEs were observed in 2.1% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm. No Grade 
4 VTEs occurred in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm. Grade 5 was observed in 0.3% of patients in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel. Venous thrombo-embolic events have been categorized as a potential risk 
(see Risk Management Plan). 
Cyramza has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients experience 
symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it is recommended that they do not drive or use 
machines until the effect subsides (see SmPC, section 4.7). 
There is no data on overdose in humans. Cyramza has been administered in a Phase 1 study up to 10 
mg/kg every two weeks without reaching a maximum tolerated dose. In case of overdose, supportive 
therapy should be used (see SmPC, section 4.9). 
From the safety database,  a summary of ADRs reported in ≥  5 % of ramucirumab treated patients in 
RAINBOW and REGARD study  have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (see SmPC, 
section 4.8). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of ramucirumab is generally acceptable and in line with other agents targeting inhibition 
of the VEGF/VEGFR axis, with fatigue/asthenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhoea, epistaxis and 
hypertension being the most common adverse reactions observed in ramucirumab-treated patients.

Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 3.0, the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for ramucirumab (Cyramza) for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with disease progression after 
prior platinum and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy in combination with paclitaxel and  for the treatment 
of adult patients (monotherapy) with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma with disease progression after prior platinum or fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy, for 
whom treatment in combination with paclitaxel is not appropriate is acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Ramucirumab+paclitaxel combination therapy 
The results of RAIBOW study, has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of ramucirumab plus 
paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone in terms of the primary endpoint OS (HR 0.807, 95%: CI 0.678, 
0.962, p=0.0169), with a gain in median OS of 2.2 months in favour of ramucirumab + paclitaxel (median 
OS 9.6 months vs 7.4 months, respectively). The effect on OS was observed in several subgroups of the 
population. 
Treatment with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death 
by  37%  (HR  =  0.635;  95%  CI:  0.536,  0.752;  p<0.0001),  representing  a  52%  (1.5  months)  longer 
median PFS in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm compared with the placebo plus paclitaxel arm (4.4 
months vs. 2.9 months). The robustness of the main PFS analysis results was supported by pre-specified 
sensitivity analyses, as demonstrated by consistent HRs between 0.599 and 0.649 with p<0.0001.  
More patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm had improved or stable EORTC QLQ-C30 Global 
Health status at each visit during the treatment compared to the placebo plus paclitaxel arm. 
Ramucirumab monotherapy 
Ramucirumab monotherapy was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the primary 
endpoint of OS for ramucirumab plus BSC versus placebo plus BSC (HR = 0.776; 95% CI: 0.603, 0.998; 
p=0.0473), with gain of 1.4 months of median OS in favour of RAMUCIRUMAB (median OS 5.2 months vs 
3.8 months, respectively). 
Treatment with ramucirumab significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 52% (HR = 
0.483; 95% CI: 0.376, 0.620; p<0.0001), resulting in a 62% longer median time to disease progression 
in  the  ramucirumab  arm.  Progression  free  survival  at  12  weeks  was  40.1%  in  the  ramucirumab  arm 
versus 15.8% in the placebo arm (p<0.0001).  Improvements in PFS were observed with ramucirumab 
across all subgroups. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Ramucirumab+paclitaxel combination therapy 
Tumour tissue of patients included in the RAINBOW study was not tested for HER2 overexpression. Based 
on limited data from REGARD patients with HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and patients 
previously  treated  with  trastuzumab  (in  RAINBOW),  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  Cyramza  has  a 
detrimental effect or that it has no effect on patients with HER2 positive gastric cancer (see SmPC section 
5.1). 
Ramucirumab monotherapy 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 93/102 
 
 
  
 
One remaining uncertainty is whether the dose selection in the monotherapy indication has been optimal. 
Although there was some evidence for ramucirumab activity there was no clear dose effect relation in the 
dose finding studies (2-20 mg/kg).  Evaluation of every-2-week (6 to 10 mg/kg) and every-3-week (15 to 
20  mg/kg)  dose  regimens  did  not  result  in  a  maximum  tolerated  dose.  All  dose  regimens  were  well 
tolerated. No phase 2 study in gastric cancer was conducted to support the dose selection. Additional 
follow-up will further investigate the optimal dose (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of ramucirumab was consistent across studies and in line with other agents 
targeting inhibition of the VEGFR: the most common adverse reactions associated with ramucirumab 
treatment (as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel) were fatigue/asthenia, neutropenia, 
leukopenia, diarrhoea, epistaxis, and hypertension. 
In combination treatment (RAINBOW study), the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions with a 
higher incidence in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm was neutropenia (54.4% v. 31.0). This event did 
not result in the death of any patient and did not result in an increased incidence of neutropenic fever 
which was low and similar in both treatments. Adverse drug reactions of grade ≥ 3 higher with 
combination treatment included neutropenia (40.7% vs. 18.8%), leukopenia (17.4% vs. 6.7%), 
hypertension (14.7% vs. 2.7%) and fatigue (11.9% vs. 5.0%). However, the percentage of patients 
experiencing TEAEs leading to discontinuation was similar between treatment groups (20.8% in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm versus 20.7% in the placebo plus paclitaxel arm). The proportion of 
deaths considered by the investigator related to study therapy was similar between treatment groups 
(3.4% v. 4.3% for ramucirmab+paclitaxel v. placebo+paclitaxel, respectively). 
In monotherapy (REGARD study), hypertension (16.1% vs. 7.6%), diarrhea (14.4% v. 8.7%), and 
headache (9.3% v. 3.5%) were more frequent in the ramucirumab group. Adverse drug reactions of 
grade ≥ 3 higher more frequently associated with monotherapy treatment included hypertension (7.6% 
v. 2.6%) and abdominal pain (5.9% v. 2.6%). The proportion of deaths considered by the investigator 
related to study therapy was similar between treatment groups (2.1% v. 1.7% for ramucirmab v. placebo, 
respectively). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects  
No specific uncertainties about the unfavourable effects raised concerns outside those mentioned in the 
RMP (see discussion on clinical safety and RMP).  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In combination with paclitaxel, the OS benefit is considered clinically relevant and robustly demonstrated 
(difference in median OS of 2.2 months). Results in key secondary endpoints supported the observed 
improvement in overall survival. Furthermore, measures of EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health status also 
tended to favour ramucirumab + paclitaxel treated patients over placebo+paclitaxel ones. The results are 
considered to be mature, consistent and of clinical relevance.  
The benefit in terms of OS when ramucirumab is administered as monotherapy in patients with 
progressive advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma previously treated with 5FU 
and/or platinum containing chemotherapy, although less pronounced compared to the combination 
therapy (difference in median OS of 1.4 months compared to 2.2 months), is considered clinical relevant. 
The results obtained for the secondary endpoint, PFS, are in line with the effect on OS.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/1362/2015  
Page 94/102 
 
 
  
 
The toxicity associated with ramucirumab was expected based on the mechanism of action. The incidence 
of adverse drug reactions was higher for the combination treatment of ramucirumab+paclitaxel 
compared to placebo+paclitaxel but did not result in a higher proportion of treatment-related deaths or 
treatment discontinuation. In monotherapy, hypertension, diarrhea, and headache were more frequent 
with ramucirumab compared to placebo but the differences in grade 3 or higher adverse drug reactions 
were small. The proportion of treatment-related deaths was also similar between groups. 
Benefit-risk balance 
For the ramucirumab and paclitaxel combination, the observed improvement in overall survival has 
clearly been shown. In view of the reasonably well tolerated toxicity, the benefit/risk balance for the 
combination of ramucirumab +paclitaxel therapy is therefore considered positive.  
Similarly, the benefit/risk balance for the monotherapy is considered positive based on the improvement 
in overall survival and the tolerable toxicity. However, the effect size associated with monotherapy was of 
small magnitude and the benefits were considered to outweigh the risks by a relatively smaller amount 
(see discussion on the benefit-risk balance). 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The data presented have shown convincing evidence of efficacy of ramucirumab in combination with 
paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with 
disease progression after prior platinum and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. The effect in terms of 
overall survival is clinically relevant in this condition, which is associated with a very poor prognosis.  
There may be an opportunity to further optimise the benefit/risk profile in the monotherapy setting given 
the exposure-efficacy relationship and overall safety profile observed in the REGARD study. Given the 
mild safety profile of ramucirumab in the monotherapy, and the considerable higher MTD of 13 mg/kg 
QW, an alternative dosing regimen may be explored. To explore this further, the applicant will submit the 
results of a of a phase II dose-response study investigating three alternative ramucirumab monotherapy 
dosing regimens. 
Although the benefit-risk balance is overall considered to be favourable for the single-agent regimen as 
well, the effect size in terms of overall survival was larger for the combination regimen (albeit from an 
indirect comparison). Therefore, the balance of benefits and risks for monotherapy was carefully 
considered. A minority of CHMP members considered that the effect associated with ramucirumab as 
single agent was too marginal and possibly even inferior to single-agent chemotherapy that are used in 
this setting.  However, according to the prevalent CHMP view, the benefits outweighed the risks and 
although the effect on OS was relatively small, this could still represent a useful therapeutic option in this 
second-line setting, when chemotherapy in combination with ramucirumab is not the preferred option. 
Thus, the CHMP concluded that single-agent treatment in this second-line setting should be restricted to 
patients for whom treatment with ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel is not appropriate (see 
SmPC section 4.1).  
The CHMP also assessed the generalizability of results, in view of the fact that the pivotal clinical trials 
only recruited patients with good performance status (ECOG PS 0 or 1), and assessed whether a 
restriction of the indication to good performance status patients was necessary. The CHMP concluded that 
although there is some uncertainty on whether similar efficacy and safety results could be observed in 
patients with poor performance status, it is common for clinical trials to recruit good prognosis patients. 
Furthermore, in view of the relatively tolerable safety profile, the CHMP considered that this uncertainty 
raised no major concerns in terms of safety. Thus, in the absence of clear signals against the 
generalizability of results, the CHMP concluded against a restriction of the indication to patients with good 
performance status. However, the CHMP agreed that attention should be drawn (see SmPC section 4.1)

to information about the population recruited in the clinical studies and the efficacy results observed in 
the different regimens as described in the SmPC section 5.1. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of 
adult patients with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with disease 
progression after prior platinum and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy and  the risk-benefit balance of 
ramucirumab monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastric cancer or 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with disease progression after prior platinum or 
fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy, for whom treatment in combination with paclitaxel is not appropriate are 
favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS 
Some members of the CHMP expressed a divergent position as follows: 
Monotherapy Indication 
The MAA presented the REGARD study to support the use of Cyramza as monotherapy in second line 
gastric cancer.  
The Applicant justified the placebo control by the fact that chemotherapy was not an accepted standard 
in this setting when the study was initiated. Patients were not selected on their non-eligibility to any 
treatment. Indeed, at progression, 33% of patients received chemotherapy (third line) when disease 
progression is expected to have further lowered the acceptability of chemotherapy.  
This may indicate that much more than one third of enrolled patients would have been amenable to an 
active treatment on second line, at time of randomization and were thus under-treated with placebo. 
This considerably weakens the evidence brought by the REGARD to show a benefit with Cyramza 
monotherapy in the whole included population. In addition, any conclusion limited to patients not 
eligible to chemotherapy would be hazardous since the exact representation of this subgroup in the 
REGARD study is unknown and necessarily inferior to 66%. 
In contrast, the RAINBOW study demonstrated a modest benefit over chemotherapy when Cyramza is 
combined with paclitaxel. These results cannot be extrapolated to Cyramza monotherapy. There is no 
evidence that, when the combination is not appropriate, a monotherapy with Cyramza is superior to 
chemotherapy. It is even impossible to exclude that Cyramza monotherapy is inferior to chemotherapy. 
For all these reasons, the monotherapy indication granted to Cyramza which potentially includes patient 
candidates for chemotherapy appears to extrapolate and is not based on demonstrative evidence.

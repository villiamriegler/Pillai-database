Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation)

esketamine 
On 10 December 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Spravato. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International 
N.V. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2   
Spravato, in combination with a SSRI or SNRI, is indicated for adults with treatment-resistant 
Major Depressive Disorder, who have not responded to at least two different treatments with 
antidepressants in the current moderate to severe depressive episode (see section 5.1).  
Spravato, co-administered with oral antidepressant therapy, is indicated in adults with 
a moderate to severe episode of Major Depressive Disorder, as acute short-term 
treatment, for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms, which according to clinical 
judgement constitute a psychiatric emergency  
See section 5.1 for a description of the populations studied. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

days from adoption of the opinion

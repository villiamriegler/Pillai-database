The applicant submitted the responses to the clinical questions of the first consolidated CPMP 
list of comments on 16 January 1995. 
The Rapporteur’s first “responses” chemical-pharmaceutical assessment report was prepared on 
24 January 1995. 
A  meeting  took  place  between  the  Rapporteur,  Co-Rapporteur  and  applicant  to  discuss 
remaining biotechnological issues on 28 February 1995. 
The Rapporteur’s first “responses” clinical assessment report was prepared on 3 March 1995. 
The  Rapporteur’s  first  “responses”  chemical-pharmaceutical  assessment  report  was  circulated 
with a proposal for a second consolidated list of comments on 9 March 1995. 
The Co-Rapporteur circulated the first “responses” assessment reports to all members on 
20 March 1995. 
The  applicant’  s  answers  to  the  biotechnology/biological  questions  were  considered  by  the 
CPMP ad hoc Biotechnology Working Party during its meeting on 3-4 April 1995. 
The CPMP in its meeting on 26-27 April 1995 discussed the recommendations presented by the 
CPMP ad hoc Biotechnology W.P.  
The remaining comments were sent to the applicant on 3 May 1995. 
The applicant submitted their responses to the second consolidated CPMP list of questions on

During  the  CPMP  meeting  on  13  September  1995,  the  recommendation  of  the  Biotechnology 
W.P. was discussed and a hearing with the applicant was planned in order to address remaining 
concerns related to the viral safety of bovine serum used for production of NovoSeven. 
During the CPMP Biotechnology W.P. meeting on 16 October 1995, the clarifications given by 
the company were considered. The Biotech WP party recognised the clinical usefulness of this 
medicinal product and considered that the Company had made considerable efforts to assure the 
viral safety of the final product. 
The  CPMP  in  their  meeting  on  17-18  October  considered  the  report  from  the  Biotechnology 
Working Party and general agreement was reached that the clarifications given by the company 
were reassuring, and that the finished product had a satisfactory viral safety profile due to the 
quality system put into place by the company. 
The  company  submitted  on  17  October  1995  their  letter  of  commitment  for  providing 
information  on  the  remaining  biotechnology/pharmaceutical  points  as  requested  by  the

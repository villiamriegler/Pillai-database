EPAR summary for the public 
Eklira Genuair 
aclidinium bromide 
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Eklira Genuair. It explains how 
the Agency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation in the EU and its conditions of use. 
It is not intended to provide practical advice on how to use Eklira Genuair. 
For practical information about using Eklira Genuair, patients should read the package leaflet or 
contact their doctor or pharmacist. 
What is Eklira Genuair and what is it used for? 
Eklira Genuair is a medicine that is used to relieve the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is a long-term disease in which the airways and air sacs inside the 
lungs become damaged or blocked, leading to difficulty breathing. Eklira Genuair is used for 
maintenance (regular) treatment. 
Eklira Genuair contains the active substance aclidinium bromide.  
How is Eklira Genuair used? 
Eklira Genuair is available as an inhalation powder in a portable inhaler device. Each inhalation 
provides 375 micrograms of aclidinium bromide equivalent to 322 micrograms of aclidinium.  
The recommended dose of Eklira Genuair is one inhalation twice a day. For detailed information on 
using the inhaler correctly, see the instructions in the package leaflet. 
Eklira Genuair can only be obtained with a prescription. 
How does Eklira Genuair work? 
The active substance in Eklira Genuair, aclidinium bromide, is an antimuscarinic bronchodilator. This 
means that it widens the airways by blocking muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic receptors control the

contraction of muscles and when aclidinium bromide is inhaled, it relaxes the muscles of the airways. 
This helps to keep the airways open and allows the patient to breathe more easily. 
What benefits of Eklira Genuair have been shown in studies? 
A main study involving 828 patients with COPD found that Eklira Genuair was more effective than 
placebo (a dummy treatment) at improving how well the lungs work. The study compared two doses of 
Eklira Genuair (200 and 400 micrograms) inhaled twice a day with placebo. The main measure of 
effectiveness was how Eklira Genuair improved patients’ forced expiratory volumes (FEV1, the 
maximum volume of air a person can breathe out in one second). On average, after six months of 
treatment, the FEV1 in patients who used 200 and 400 micrograms Eklira Genuair increased compared 
with placebo by 99 ml and 128 ml respectively. The dose of 400 micrograms Eklira Genuair 
corresponds to an inhalation providing 322 micrograms of aclidinium. 
What are the risks associated with Eklira Genuair? 
The most common side effects with Eklira Genuair (which may affect more than 5 patients in 100) are 
headache and nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat). Other common side effects 
(which may affect more than 1 patient in 100) are sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses), cough, 
nausea (feeling sick) and diarrhoea. For the full list of all side effects and restrictions with Eklira 
Genuair, see the package leaflet. 
Why is Eklira Genuair approved? 
The CHMP noted that Eklira Genuair was shown to be effective at improving the symptoms of COPD, 
and its beneficial effects are maintained for up to a year. The CHMP also noted that there were no 
major safety concerns with Eklira Genuair, with side effects being reversible and similar to other 
antimuscarinic bronchodilator medicines. Therefore, the CHMP decided that Eklira Genuair’s benefits 
are greater than its risks and recommended that it be given marketing authorisation. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Eklira Genuair? 
As antimuscarinic bronchodilator medicines may have an effect on the heart and blood vessels, the 
company will closely monitor the medicine’s cardiovascular effects and will carry out a further study in 
patients to identify any potential risks. 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Eklira Genuair have also been included in the summary of product characteristics 
and the package leaflet.

Extension of indication to include treatment of unresectable or metastatic HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 
2+/ISH-) breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or 
developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer must additionally have received or be 
ineligible for endocrine therapy; for ENHERTU, based on final results from study DS8201-A-U303 
(DESTINY-Breast04). This is a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled trial of 
Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd), an Anti-HER2-antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC), versus treatment of 
physician’s choice for HER2-low, unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer subjects. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 1.4 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update section 4.4 of the 
SmPC to update the dosing recommendation for corticosteroid treatment (e.g. prednisolone) with a 
daily dose. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
CW/0001/2015 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

The initially applied indication was as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer who have received a 
prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6

months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast 
cancer must additionally have received or be ineligible for endocrine therapy. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Breast Cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide (11.7% of all cancer sites) and 
the leading cause of cancer death in women (15.5% of all cancer sites in 2020). In 2020, there was an 
estimated 2.26 million new cases of female BC globally, with an estimated 684,996 deaths due to BC 
(Globocan 2020).  
Biologic features 
According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) 
recommendations for HER2 testing in BC, HER2 receptor status is classified as “HER2-positive” (tumors 
scoring 3+ or 2+ by immunohistochemistry [IHC] and HER2 gene amplification by in situ hybridization 
[ISH]) or “HER2 negative” (tumors scoring 2+ by IHC and no evidence of HER2 gene amplification by 
ISH or tumors scoring 1+ or 0 by IHC). Among patients with HER2-negative BC, approximately 50% 
have tumors with low HER2 expression (defined as tumors scoring 2+ or 1+ by IHC and no evidence of 
HER2 gene amplification). HER2-low tumors constitute a heterogeneous population that include both 
luminal-type hormone receptor-positive BC and hormone receptor-negative BC (triple-negative breast 
cancer [TNBC]). 
Management 
Current therapeutic guidelines for patients with breast cancer exhibiting HER2-low expression are the 
same as those for patients with HER2 negative breast cancer. In the targeted metastatic setting, 
treatment recommendations are based on tumor hormone receptor status (positive or negative, i.e., 
presence or absence of estrogen and/or progesterone receptors), presence or absence of visceral 
crisis, and menopausal status (Gennari et al. ESMO. 2021). 
The recommended treatment in the targeted second- and subsequent-line setting for patients with 
hormone receptor positive (HR+) disease, previously exposed to endocrine therapy (ET), are 
fulvestrant in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. If a CDK4/6 inhibitor was not previously used, 
everolimus with either an AI, tamoxifen or fulvestrant, monotherapy with fulvestrant, a non-steroidal 
or a steroidal AI, or a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) is recommended. For patients 
with PIK3CA-mutated tumours, the preferred option is fulvestrant with alpelisib.  Once metastatic 
hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative BC is refractory to ET, the standard of care (SoC) is 
sequential systemic single-agent chemotherapy. Because of the lack of clear superiority, no specific 
chemotherapy is recommended in clinical practice guidelines but the most commonly used regimens 
include anthracyclines (doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin), anti-metabolites (capecitabine and 
gemcitabine), microtubule inhibitors (vinorelbine and eribulin), and taxanes (paclitaxel). Combination 
therapies, although rarely used, may be useful in patients with rapid clinical progression or need for 
rapid symptom and/or disease control.  Other available systemic therapies include PARP inhibitors for 
patients with BRCA germline mutations and alpelisib for patients with PIK3CA-mutated tumors.  
For patients with HR-negative disease (Triple-negative disease (TNBC)), the available treatment 
options are as follows.  For patients with PDL1-negative disease, the treatment in the first-line setting 
is sequential single agent chemotherapy using the same preferred chemotherapeutic options as those 
for patients with hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative BC refractory to ET.  Regardless of BRCA 
status, for patients with TNBC previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in the adjuvant or 
Assessment report

neoadjuvant setting, platinum agents are the preferred option. For patients with BRCA mutations, the 
recommendation is to use PARP inhibitors or platinum agents and for patients with PD L1-positive 
TNBC, the preferred therapeutic option in the first-line setting is an immune-checkpoint inhibitor in 
combination with chemotherapy. For the later line setting after at least two previous regimens, with at 
least one of them in the metastatic setting, the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) sacituzumab govitecan 
is approved (see Trodelvy SmPC/EPAR).

Treatment outcomes with currently approved therapies in patients with metastatic HER2-negative 
breast cancer, who progressed on ET and at least 1 line of chemotherapy illustrate the high unmet 
medical need for new treatment options (Table 1).  No targeted therapy is specifically approved for 
patients with HER2-low BC. The most recently approved single agents for patients with metastatic 
hormone receptor-positive HER2-low BC, who progressed on or are not eligible for ET are abemaciclib 
and eribulin. Abemaciclib has since been approved in earlier lines of therapy and is rarely used in the 
proposed setting where the cornerstone of treatment remains conventional chemotherapy.   
2.1.2.  About the product 
Enhertu, trastuzumab deruxtecan, is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody is a 
humanised anti-HER2 IgG1 attached to deruxtecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd) bound by a 
tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. The antibody-drug conjugate is stable in plasma. The function of 
the antibody portion is to bind to HER2 expressed on the surface of certain tumour cells. After binding, 
the trastuzumab deruxtecan complex then undergoes internalisation and intracellular linker cleavage 
by lysosomal enzymes that are upregulated in cancer cells. Upon release, the membrane-permeable 
DXd causes DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. DXd, an exatecan derivative, is approximately 10 
times more potent than SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. 
Enhertu is currently approved as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based 
regimens. In November 2022, the CHMP gave a positive opinion for the treatment of adult patients 
with advanced HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have 
received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen. 
Enhertu is currently conditionally approved and the confirmatory study for the CMA is Study U301, a 
phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled study of T-DXd versus treatment of 
investigator’s choice for HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer subjects pre-
treated with prior standard of care HER2 therapies, including T-DM1. The due date for submission is 
estimated to 4Q 2022. 
The recommended dose of Enhertu is 5.4 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks 
(21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The same posology is proposed for 
the applied indication. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The focus of this application is the randomized, active controlled Phase 3 Study DS8201-A-U303 
(DESTINY-Breast04; hereinafter referred to as Study U303) in which the target population are patients 
with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low BC, who received T-DXd at the target dose of 5.4 mg/kg or 
treatment per physician’s choice (TPC) in the second-line metastatic setting. It is agreed that the 
scientific advice given from the CHMP regarding the pivotal study U303 was generally followed. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Applicant stated that all studies of trastuzumab deruxtecan were conducted in accordance with the 
ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), according to International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline E6 and that all trials conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki

and informed, written consent was obtained from all patients as per GCP requirement. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The default PECSURFACEWATER was above the PEC action limit for triggering a full ERA (see EPAR from 
initial MA). The PEC based on maximum daily dose was approximately 21-fold higher than if based on 
the actual dose regime recommended (once every 3 weeks). A PEC accounting for the actual dosing 
regimen would clearly be below the trigger (≤0.01 μg/L); however, the PEC was subsequently refined 
by utilising prevalence data on the newly claimed indication. In order to estimate refined 
PECSURFACEWATER, calculation of refined Fpen was based on breast cancer prevalence data as provided in 
the Globocan database. The prevalence data were not specifying the type of HER-2 status, hence, the 
new indication of HER-2 low status can be assumed included in the general prevalence of breast 
cancer. Therefore, no increase in consumption for calculation of refined Fpen is expected with this 
extension of indication.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis 
For characterization of T-DXd PK, concentrations of T-DXd (the intact antibody-drug conjugate [ADC]), 
total anti-HER2 antibody, and DXd were measured by validated bioanalytical methods. Immunogenicity 
assessment for anti-T-DXd antibodies in serum was conducted using a validated bioanalytical method. 
The ADA positive samples were further analysed for detection of NAb against T-DXd. 
Pop PK analyses 
Data handling was performed using R (version 4.0.5 or higher) or SAS (version 9.4 or higher). 
NONMEM (version 7.4.3 or higher) was used for PK analyses. FOCE INTER was used for PopPK model 
development. Xpose and PsN (version 4.8.1) were used for model diagnostics and covariate testing. R

(version 4.0.5) in RStudio (version 1.1.383 or higher) was used for data exploration, post-processing 
of results and simulations based on the final models for T-DXd and DXd.  
The Pop PK analysis was performed using PK data from four Phase 1 studies (Studies J101, J102, A103 
and A104), four Phase 2 studies (Studies U201, J202, U204 and U205), and two Phase 3 studies 
(Studies U302 and U303) (see table 2). After inclusion of Study U303, the analysis dataset had 1128 
(67%), 293 (18%), 199 (12%), and 55 (3%) subjects with BC, GC, NSCLC, and other cancers 
(including colorectal), respectively. Of these, 919 (55%) were HER2-positive, and 468 (28%) were 
HER2-low, with the remaining subjects (17%) having HER2-negative, mutant, overexpressing, or 
missing status. A summary of included PK data is shown in below table. 
Table 3 Summary of PK data 
The previous PopPK analysis that included data from all studies, except for Study U303, was used for 
model development. The T-DXd data was described by a two-compartment model with linear 
elimination, and DXd was described by a one-compartment model, with time-varying release of drug 
from T-DXd (figure below).

A sequential modelling approach was used to re-estimate model parameters with the updated analysis 
dataset. First the T-DXd parameter estimates and corresponding covariate effects were re-estimated 
using only the PK data for T-DXd. The effects of Asian from Japan on V2,T-DXd changed by >20% 
relative to the prior estimates. This effect was retained in the T-DXd model as removal increased the 
OFV by 34 units. Region was correlated with race-country. No new covariate correlations were 
identified. The final T-DXd model (run010) suggested that CL,T-DXd increased with increasing body 
weight, baseline tumour size, and for GC, NSCLC or other cancers; CL,T-DXd decreased with increasing 
albumin and being Asian from Japan; V1,T-DXd increased with increasing body weight, in males and 
for GC; and V2,T-DXd decreased in Asian subjects from Japan. The final Pop PK parameters for T-DXd 
is shown in below table. 
Table 4 Final Pop PK parameters for T-DXd 
The DXd parameters and corresponding covariate effects were then re-estimated based on the whole 
updated dataset with parameters for T-DXd fixed. With the addition of Study U303, the covariate 
effects of GC and NSCLC on CL,DXd and FL-DP1 formulation, NSCLC and race-country (non-Asian) on 
the V,DXd changed by >20% compared to the same parameters in the previous DXd PopPK model. 
The effects of GC and NSCLC on CL,DXd and FL-DP1 formulation on V,DXd were no longer significant 
following backward deletion (p>0.001) and were removed. Removal of NSCLC and race-country (non-
Asian) effects on V,DXd resulted in a significant increase in OFV of 26 and 93 units and therefore they 
were retained. Covariate correlations were identified between race-country, region, weight and BSA. 
Thus, race-country was not tested. Parameter estimates for the final DXd model (run034) are 
presented in Table 5. Residual variability was modelled with a proportional error structure and 
estimated to be 30% with 7.51% shrinkage.

and DXd outliers from Study U303 (run034s). A second sensitivity analysis showed no impact of 
including additional 211 (of which 30 were BLQ) DXd samples (run034ss), that were re-analysed after 
primary DCO.

Exposure parameters for HER2-low subjects in Study U303 were predicted using the final Pop PK 
model for DXd (run 0034). T-DXd and DXd exposure were comparable between HER2-positive and 
HER2-low BC at the same dose. PK parameters for T-DXd and DXd based on the non-compartmental 
analysis of Cycle 1 PK data for HER2-positive or HER2-low patients following 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg doses

Special populations 
In the Pop PK population, there were 571 Asian subjects from Japan, 337 Asian subjects not from 
Japan, and 767 non-Asian subjects. Subjects were aged 20 to 96 years, weighing 27.3 to 125 kg, with 
BSA ranging 1.06 to 2.45 m2, albumin ranging 22 to 55 g/L, total bilirubin ranging 1 to 57.1 U/L, ALT 
ranging 2.00 to 202 U/L, LDH ranging 99.0 to 6850 U/L, ALP ranging 24.0 to 2650 U/L and CrCL 
ranging 25.3 to 264 mL/min. Of the 1675 subjects, 962 (58%) subjects received prior HER2 therapy. 
The clinical relevance of covariate effects included in the final Pop PK model was evaluated using 
Forest plots (Figures 6 and 7). For TDXd, subjects with low albumin (31 g/L; 5th percentile) had an 
approximately 21% lower steady state Cmin when compared to a typical BC subject with an albumin of 
40 g/L. Subjects with extreme values of body weight (90kg; 95th percentile) had an approximately 
27% higher Cmax and a 30% higher AUC relative to a typical BC subject of body weight 59 kg.

For DXd, subjects with extreme values of body weight (90 kg; 95th percentile) had an approximately

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology is described in the initial BC application (see initial EPAR). 
Immunogenicity 
In Study U303, the treatment-emergent incidence of ADAs against T-DXd was 2.0% (7 of 357 
subjects). The data available indicated no association between ADA status and allergic-type reactions. 
The incidence of NAbs against T-DXd was 0.1% across all studies (1 of 1668 subjects). The timepoints 
of immunogenicity samples in Study U303 are shown in Table 8. A summary of the available 
immunogenicity data is shown in Table 9.

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response (ER) analyses 
R (version 4.0.5) was used for exposure-efficacy modelling, data explorations prior to and/or after 
modelling, and simulations based on exposure-efficacy models. 
Exposure metrics were generated from the final PopPK model using individual post hoc Bayes 
estimates. Binary variables were explored using boxplots, logistic regression plots or exposure-event 
tables. For time-to-event variables, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted by exposure quartile. 
Cox regression models were fit to the endpoints. Covariates were tested on the intercept and the slope 
of logistic ER relationships or on the intercept of Cox regression models. Covariates were tested using 
a forward search at p<0.05 followed by a backward search at p<0.01 using the likelihood ratio test. 
Exposure was included in the backward search process, except for logistic regression safety endpoints. 
Exposure-efficacy relations 
All subjects with HER2-positive BC from Study U303 who were treated with T-DXd and had individual 
estimated exposures were included in the exposure-efficacy population. Efficacy data from Study U303 
and Study J101 were not pooled due to the differences in subject population and study design. Thus, a 
total of 362 HER2-low subjects were included in the exposure-efficacy analyses of PFS, OS and ORR, of 
which 324 were HR-positive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 31/139 
 
 
 
 
For PFS, Cox-regression showed a significant correlation (using a z-test) to T-DXd AUC in Cycle 1 for 
all subjects (p=0.038), but not in HR-positive (p=0.112) subjects. Because exposure was not present 
in the final model for PFS in all subjects or for PFS in HR positive subjects, no PFS simulations were 
performed. PFS final model parameters are shown in Table 10.  
Table 10 PFS final model parameters in all subjects 
For OS, T-DXd Cmin in Cycle 1 (Cmin1) were selected for all subjects and for HR-positive subjects 
because it had the smallest p-value (p<0.001) by log-rank test and a negative effect on the OS hazard 
ratio in the univariate Cox-regression analysis. T-DXd AUC1, T-DXd AUCSS, and T-DXd CminSS had 
also significant effect on OS for all subjects. A significant ER relationship was detected for OS in all 
subjects which was confirmed by model-based analysis using multivariate Cox-regression that showed 
significant effect of T-DXd Cmin1. Other covariates that were detected included ECOG, AST, prior 
chemotherapy lines in the metastatic setting and race-country. See figure 13 and Table 11.

Table 11 OS final model parameters in all subjects 
The exposure-response of OS showed a shallow relationship across all covariates. Day 360 OS 
probabilities at the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of exposure were 0.815, 0.877, and 0.929 
respectively. The difference between Day 360 OS probability at the extremes of exposure in U303 were 
within 6% of the Day 360 OS probability at the median exposure. 
For ORR in all subjects and in HR-positive subjects, CminSS was selected because it had the smallest 
p-values (p=0.004 and p=0.009) by Kruskal-Wallis test. ORR in HR-positive subjects was not 
modelled. See Figures 14, 15 and Table 12 for ORR.

Exposure-safety relations 
The previous exposure-safety analyses were based on data from Studies J101, J102, A103, A104, 
U201, J202, U204, U205, U302 and updated with data from Study U303. A total of 1675 subjects were 
included, of whom 1328 (79%) were female and 347 (21%) were male, 569 (34%) were Asians from 
Japan, 337 (20%) were Asians from countries other than Japan, and 769 (46%) were non-Asians. The 
median age was 58 years, and the median body weight was 60.0 kg. Most subjects had BC (67%) and 
were HER2-positive (55%) and 22% were HER2-low.  
The evaluated endpoints were: Grade 3 TEAEs, Grade 3 anaemia, Grade 3 neutrophil count decreased, 
Grade 3 platelet count decreased, Any Grade drug-related adjudicated interstitial lung disease (ILD), 
Grade 3 adjudicated ILD, and Grade 2 laboratory defined left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)

decreased by echocardiogram/multigated acquisition scan (ECHO/MUGA). Additional safety endpoints 
were included in explorative analyses. 
Per modeled safety endpoint, the prior model was fit to the updated exposure-safety analysis set and 
model parameters and covariate effects were re-estimated. Any covariates that were not significant 
(p>0.05 using z-test) were removed and re-evaluated using forward and backward covariate analysis.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package included in the current application is based on data from a Phase 3 
study in subjects with HER2-low BC (Study U303) plus data from nine prior studies. The T-DXd PK was 
described by a two-compartment model with linear elimination, and DXd PK was described by a one-
compartment model, with time-varying release of drug from T-DXd. The previous Pop PK model for BC 
was updated with data from Study U303 in a sequential way with T-DXd data first. In the Pop PK 
population, 919 subjects (55%) were HER2-positive, and 468 subjects (28%) were HER2-low. No new 
covariates were identified. The final Pop PK model (run034) could adequately describe the data from 
BC patients independent of HER2 status (positive or low). 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody and DXd is 
considered well-characterised and described in the initial BC application. The recommended 5.4 mg/kg 
Q3W dose regimen for HER2-low BC patients applied in Study U303 resulted in comparable exposures 
to the approved regimen of T
DXd for subjects with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BC. The 
recommended dose regimen is weight-based and resulted in increased Cmax and AUC with increasing 
‑
body weight. Extended Forest plots indicated that subjects of lower body weight (<41 kg, 
corresponding to the 2.5th body weight percentile) experienced T-Dxd and Dxd exposures at steady-
state, below the 0.8 exposure ratio relative to a typical Asian female BC subject of 59 kg. The impact 
was largest on Cmax,ss and AUC,ss and less pronounced on Cmin,ss. For subjects with body weights 
above 90 kg, the steady-state exposure for T-Dxd and Dxd were predicted to be above the upper 1.25 
exposure ratio.  
Steady-state exposures of T-DXd and DXd were comparable between HER2-low subjects with normal 
hepatic function (n=179) and mild hepatic impairment (n=203) and between HER2-low subjects with 
normal renal function (n=209), mild (n=130) or moderate renal impairment (n=45). The incidence of 
post-baseline ADAs and NAbs in Study U303 was low, 3.6% and 0.3%, respectively. 
The exposure-efficacy relationship was evaluated in Study U303 HER2-low subjects (n=362) for PFS, 
OS and ORR. For OS and ORR, a significant ER relationship was detected in all subjects, however, the 
effect was not deemed clinically relevant for ORR. As weight had great impact on exposure, a subgroup 
analysis of efficacy measures per weight quartiles displayed by Kaplan Meier plots was requested and 
indicated some effect on OS for the lowest weight quartile which included weights up to 54 kg.  
The previous exposure-safety analyses were updated with the data from Study U303 (total n=1675). 
The E-R relationships were consistent with those detected previously. T-DXd steady-state Cmax was 
correlated with Grade ≥2 LVEF and Grade ≥3 ILD. T-DXd steady-state AUC was correlated with Any 
Grade ILD. DXd CavgTOE was correlated with Grade ≥3 TEAE and laboratory-based Grade ≥3 anemia, 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Across all evaluated safety endpoints, the model-predicted 
incidence rates were comparable between HER2-positive and HER2-low BC subjects. 
The magnitude of effect on ORR at the extremes of exposure in Study U303 is not deemed clinically 
meaningful relative to ORR at the median exposure. No relationships between increasing DXd 
exposures and decreasing PFS/OS hazard or increasing ORR probability were detected in the exposure-
efficacy analysis. Also, no effect of HER2 status (positive versus low) was detected in this analysis. 
Treatment benefit of HER2-low BC patients with very low body weight was further discussed. In the 
HER2-low BC population in Study U303, 13 subjects had a body weight below 44 kg (cut-off close to 
the 5th percentile of body weight in the ‘all BC population’). Of these, 8 subjects discontinued due to 
progressive disease. This subgroup of patients seemed to have worse prognosis in terms of ECOG 
Assessment report

Page 47/139 
 
 
 
 
status, renal function, old age, prior lines of treatment and disease burden. Comparison of simulated 
T-DXd and DXd exposures at T-DXd doses of 5.4 and 6.4 mg/kg in subjects with a body weight ≤44 kg, 
indicated the higher dose would result in approximate 20% exposure increase at Cycle 1 and at 
steady-state. A multi-variate E-R analysis indicated that the predicted OS probability at Day 360 for 
subjects with a body weight ≤44 kg would be similar at both T-DXd doses. Comparing the safety 
profiles stratified for body weight in the ‘all BC population’, the 6.4 mg/kg dose seemed to result in a 
worse safety profile compared to 5.4 mg/kg in the ≤44 kg subgroup of patients. Thus, the 
recommendation for the 5.4 mg/kg dose independent of body weight is supported. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology is considered adequately described for treatment of HER2-low BC 
subjects with T-DXd at the recommended dose 5.4 mg/kg Q3W. The final bioanalytical reports for 
Study U303 will be submitted within 6 months of study closure (PAM-REC).

Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective was to compare the PFS benefit of T-DXd to TPC in the cohort of subjects with 
HER2-low, hormone receptor-positive BC (i.e., the hormone receptor-positive cohort of the Full 
Analysis Set [FAS]), based on BICR. 
Key Secondary Objectives 
The key secondary objectives were as follows: 
• To compare the PFS benefit of T-DXd to TPC in all randomized subjects regardless of hormone-
receptor status (i.e., the FAS), based on BICR 
• To compare the OS benefit of T-DXd to TPC in subjects with HER2-low hormone receptor-positive BC 
• To compare the OS benefit of T-DXd to TPC in the FAS. 
Other Secondary Objectives 
Other secondary objectives were as follows: 
• To investigate the efficacy of T-DXd compared to TPC on the following parameters: 
− PFS in subjects with HER2-low hormone receptor-positive BC, based on investigator assessment 
− Confirmed ORR, based on BICR and investigator assessment in subjects with HER2-low hormone 
receptor-positive BC 
− DoR, based on BICR in subjects with HER2-low hormone receptor-positive BC 
− Confirmed ORR and DoR in the FAS 
• To determine pharmacokinetics (PK) of T-DXd 
• To evaluate the safety of T-DXd compared to TPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 53/139 
 
 
 
 
• To evaluate Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) endpoints for T-DXd compared to 
TPC. 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives were to evaluate the following: 
• Clinical benefit rate (CBR; the proportion of complete response [CR], partial response [PR], and ≥6 
months’ stable disease [SD]), based on BICR in subjects with hormone receptor-positive BC and in the 
FAS 
• Disease control rate (DCR), based on BICR in subjects with hormone receptor positive BC and in the 
FAS 
• Time to response (TTR) based on BICR in subjects with hormone receptor-positive BC and in the FAS 
• PFS on the next line of therapy (PFS2) 
• Potential biomarkers of response/resistance 
• Exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety endpoints 
• PFS, OS, confirmed ORR, and DoR in subjects with HER2-low hormone receptor negative BC. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS based on BICR in the hormone receptor-positive cohort. PFS 
was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of first objective 
documentation of radiographic disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any 
cause. If a subject had not progressed or died at the analysis DCO date, PFS was censored at the last 
adequate tumor evaluation date before the DCO date. Discontinuation associated with disease 
progression without supporting objective evidence satisfying progression criteria per RECIST v1.1 was 
not considered to be a PFS event.  
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• 
• 
• 
PFS based on BICR in all randomized subjects (i.e., regardless of hormone receptor status)  
OS in the hormone receptor-positive cohort 
OS in all randomized subjects  
OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.  If 
there was no death reported for a subject before the DCO for OS analysis, OS was censored at the last 
contact date at which the subject was known to be alive.  
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• 
PFS based on investigator assessment (INV).  
Confirmed ORR based on BICR and INV.  Confirmed ORR was defined as the proportion of 
• 
subjects with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that was 
confirmed by a second assessment.   
DoR based on BICR.  DoR was defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of 
• 
objective response (confirmed CR or PR) to the date of the first documentation of disease progression 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 54/139 
 
 
 
or death.  Subjects who were progression-free at the time of the DCO were censored at the date of the 
last evaluable tumor assessment. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Clinical benefit rate (CBR) based on BICR:  CBR was defined as the sum of CR rate, PR rate, 
• 
and the rate of stable disease (SD) lasting more than 6 months. 
Disease control rate (DCR) based on BICR and INV:  DCR was defined as the sum of CR rate, 
• 
PR rate, and SD rate. 
Time to response (TTR) based on BICR:  TTR was defined as the time from the date of 
• 
randomization to the date of first documentation of objective response (confirmed CR or PR) for 
responding subjects. 
PFS on next-line therapy (PFS2) based on INV:  PFS2 was defined as the time from the date of 
• 
randomization to the first documented progression on next-line therapy or death due to any cause, 
whichever came first. 
• 
• 
PFS, OS, confirmed ORR, and DoR based on BICR in the hormone receptor-negative cohort. 
Best percent change in the sum of diameters (SoD) of measurable tumors based on BICR. 
Health Economics and Outcome Research Endpoints 
Health Economics and Outcome Research (HEOR) endpoints derived using the QLQ-C30, QLQ-BR45 
(BR23), and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires, and hospitalization-related endpoints. The primary patient 
reported outcome (PRO) variable of interest was the global health status/global quality-of-life (QoL) 
scale score of the QLQ C30.  Secondary PRO variables of interest were physical functioning, emotional 
functioning, and social functioning subscale scores of the QLQ C30, the BC symptom scale of the QLQ-
BR45, and the index score of the EQ 5D-5L. Because the QLQ-BR45 was still undergoing validation at 
the time of the analysis, these analyses were performed using the QLQ-BR23 scoring guidelines and 
are presented in the results as QLQ-BR45/BR23. 
Sample size 
Approximately 480 subjects with hormone receptor-positive BC were planned to be randomized 
(approximately 320 T-DXd and 160 TPC). In addition, approximately 60 subjects with hormone 
receptor-negative BC (approximately 40 T-DXd and 20 TPC) were planned to be enrolled for 
exploratory purposes. 
Assuming a true hazard ratio of 0.68 (corresponding an improvement in median PFS from the 
physician’s choice arm of 4.2 months [NCT00337103] to a median PFS in T-DXd arm of 6.2 months), a 
total of 318 PFS events per BICR in HR-positive cohort was needed to ensure at least 90% power of 
log-rank test to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in PFS distributions at 2-sided alpha of 0.05 
in HR-positive cohort (primary analysis). A total of ~480 HR-positive subjects (~320 T-DXd and ~160 
physician’s choice) and ~60 HR-negative subjects (~40 T-DXd and ~20 physician’s choice) would be 
randomized, for a total enrollment of ~540 subjects (~360 T-DXd and ~180 physician’s choice). 
The primary efficacy analyses was to be event driven, and the primary analyses for PFS was to be 
performed when approximately 318 PFS events per BICR have been observed in the HR-positive 
population. The expected data cut-off dates for the final analyses of PFS was to be approximately 28.3 
months after the first subject is randomized, based on updated enrolment rates. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 55/139 
 
 
 
The key secondary endpoint of OS was to be compared between the 2 treatment groups, provided that 
the log-rank tests for comparison of PFS in both the HR-positive cohort and the FAS demonstrate 
statistical significance. Assuming a median OS of 15 months in the control arm and a hazard ratio of 
0.72, a total of 333 OS events was needed to ensure 80% power of a log-rank test to reject a null 
hypothesis of no difference in OS distributions at an overall 2-sided significance level of 0.05 under a 
3-look group sequential design using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming type 
superiority stopping boundary provided PFS is statistically significant. Final OS analysis was projected 
approximately 49.3 months from the date of first subject randomized when 333 OS events were 
documented in the HR-positive cohort. Approximately 162 (49%) and 233 (70%) out of the target 
total OS events were projected at the first and the second OS interim analyses in the HR positive 
cohort. 
The sample size computation was performed using the EAST 6.4. 
Randomisation 
Subjects will be randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment arms (T-DXd versus physician’s choice) in a 2:1 
ratio. The randomization was to be stratified by: 
- HER2 IHC status of tissue samples assessed by a central laboratory: HER2 IHC 1+ vs. HER2 IHC 
2+/ISH- 
- Number of prior lines of chemotherapy: 1 vs. 2 
- HR/CDK status: HR-positive with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment vs.HR-positive without prior 
CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment vs.HR-negative. 
Randomization was to be managed through an Interactive Web/Voice Response System (IXRS) for 
subjects meeting all eligibility criteria.   
All subjects were to have physician’s choice treatment declared and recorded in the IXRS prior to 
randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
The FAS included all subjects randomized into the study, including those who did not receive a dose of 
study treatment. Subjects were to be analysed according to the treatments and strata assigned at 
randomization. 
The hormone receptor positive cohort of FAS, according to baseline hormone receptor status per IXRS, 
was to be the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses. 
Per-Protocol Analysis Set (PPS) 
The PPS included all subjects in the hormone receptor positive cohort who complied sufficiently with 
the protocol with respect to exposure to study treatment, availability of tumor assessment, and 
absence of major protocol violations likely to impact efficacy outcome.

Primary efficacy endpoint: PFS based on BICR 
The primary efficacy analysis was to be the comparison of the distribution of PFS per BICR in hormone 
receptor positive cohort between the two treatment groups using stratified log-rank test, with 
stratification factors from IXRS, at two-sided significance level of 0.05. 
The distribution of PFS was to be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method for each treatment 
arm, and the results were to be presented graphically by treatment group. 
The median PFS and the two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Brookmeyer and Crowley 
method was to be provided for each treatment group. In addition, PFS rates at fixed time points (e.g., 
3, 6, 9, 12 months) and the two-sided 95% CIs will be provided for each treatment group. 
The hazard ratio of PFS and its two-sided 95% CI were estimated using stratified Cox proportional 
hazards regression model with treatment group as model factor and the stratification factors from 
IXRS as strata.

Source SAP v 2.0, page 57/152 
Supportive and Sensitivity Analyses 
As a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of stratification on primary efficacy analysis, the two 
treatment groups were to be compared using an unstratified log-rank test. The same censoring rules 
used for the primary efficacy analysis were to be applied.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 57/139 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy analyses were to be repeated for FAS and PPS if the PPS and the full analysis sets 
differed. 
A stratified Cox regression model with strata collected through IXRS as stratification factor was to be 
fitted to evaluate the effect of other baseline demographic or disease characteristics on the estimated 
hazard ratio. This model included the following key prognostic factors as covariates: ECOG 
performance status (0, 1), lines of endocrine therapy received in the metastatic setting (0, 1, >=1), 
history CNS metastases (yes, no), and age (<65, ≥65 years old).  
In addition to the above, the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were to be 
performed to assess the impact of censoring rules used for the primary efficacy analysis. Sensitivity 
analyses included the following: 
• Using the BICR-assessed PFS data on the hormone receptor positive cohort, and including PFS events 
whenever they occurred, i.e. not censoring for missing 2 consecutive tumor assessments 
• Using the BICR PFS data on the hormone receptor positive cohort, but censoring for new anticancer 
therapy 
• Backdating PFS analysis: repeat BICR PFS analysis not censoring for missing tumor assessment, but 
backdate PFS event time in the case that PFS event occurred after missing one or more tumor 
assessments. In such cases, the PFS event date would be considered to be 6 weeks after last evaluable 
tumor assessment occurring prior to progression/death. 
Additional supportive analyses included: 
• Number of subjects and number of events by treatment arm within each stratum to be presented 
along with hazard ratio obtained using unstratified cox regression model, provided enough events are 
observed within each stratum. No formal statistical comparison to be carried out within stratum. 
If there is ≥10% discrepancy between strata constructed through the eCRF data and those obtained 
through IXRS, a sensitivity analysis may be performed where the stratum is based on the eCRF data.  
If the number of BICR PFS events by the data cutoff date is more than 328 (3% over the target 
number of PFS events), a sensitivity analysis using the data up to the target 318 BICR PFS events was 
to be carried out following the primary analysis approach. 
Sensitivity analyses due to COVID-19 
Sensitivity analysis of primary analysis of PFS may have been performed if there was a considerable 
number of subjects who may have been impacted by COVID-19 and had delayed or missing tumor 
scan assessments by either excluding data from these subjects or not applying the censoring rule of 
missing 2 or more consecutive tumor assessments due to COVID-19 for PFS. No P-value was to be 
presented for these sensitivity analyses. 
Key Secondary endpoint: OS 
Overall survival was to be compared between the 2 treatment groups, using a stratified log-rank test 
stratified by the randomization stratification factors as recorded by IXRS, at 2-sided significance level 
adjusting for alpha spending, provided superiority in PFS per BICR is demonstrated in both hormone 
receptor positive cohort and FAS. The survival distribution of OS was to be estimated by Kaplan-Meier 
method and results will be presented graphically. The median survival time and the 2-sided 95% CI for 
the median were to be provided using Brookmeyer and Crowley method for each treatment group.  
The treatment effect hazard ratio and its 95% CI were estimated, using stratified Cox proportional 
hazards regression model stratified by the randomization stratification factors as recorded by the IXRS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 58/139 
 
 
 
Censoring rules for OS 
If there was no death reported for a subject before the data cutoff for OS analysis, OS was to be 
censored at the last contact date at which the subject was known to be alive. 
Supportive Analyses for OS 
If the analysis of OS was significant, a Cox regression model stratified by the IXRS stratification factors 
was to fitted to evaluate the effect of the same prognostic factors as specified earlier for the Cox 
regression analysis for PFS. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoint: Confirmed Objective Response Rate 
ORR was summarized by treatment group along with the two-sided 95% CIs using the Clopper-
Pearson method. The difference of ORR between the two treatment groups was summarized and the 
95% CI calculated using continuity correction. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by the 
randomization stratification factors per IXRS was used to compare ORR at two-sided significance level 
of 0.05. 
Subjects with only non-measurable disease at baseline were included in the numerator only if a 
complete response was observed. 
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 
No formal interim analysis was planned for PFS. 
Up to three analyses of OS were planned: 
• First interim analysis at the time of the final analysis for PFS (provided PFS is significant in both 
hormone receptor positive cohort and FAS), at which point a total of 162 OS events (49% information 
fraction) in hormone receptor positive cohort are expected. 
• If the first OS interim analysis was not significant, a second interim analysis for OS was planned 
when approximately 233 OS events (70% information fraction) in hormone receptor positive cohort 
had been documented. 
• If the second OS interim analysis was not significant, a final analysis for OS after approximately 333 
OS events in hormone receptor positive cohort had been documented. 
OS was to be compared between the 2 treatment groups at either interim or final analysis, provided 
superiority in PFS was demonstrated for both the hormone receptor positive cohort and the FAS. A 
hierarchical testing procedure was adopted as described below. 
A group sequential design, utilizing 3-look Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming 
type stop boundary was used to construct the efficacy stopping boundaries with an overall 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. The trial allowed for the early stopping of the study for a superior OS, 
provided the log-rank test for PFS had demonstrated statistical significance in both hormone receptor 
positive cohort and FAS. The same interim efficacy stopping boundaries was used for OS hypotheses 
testing with hormone receptor positive cohort and FAS. If the study continues to final analysis, the 
efficacy stopping boundaries at the final OS analysis to control the 2-sided significance level of the 
repeated testing at 0.05 was to derived separately for hormone receptor positive cohort and FAS based 
on the actual number of OS events documented at the cut-off date, and the actual information 
fractions and the alpha already spent at the interim analyses. This was to ensure the overall 
significance level at 0.05 (2-sided) across the 2 OS hypotheses testing with hormone receptor positive 
cohort and FAS, and the repeated testing of the OS hypotheses at the interim and the final analyses, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 59/139 
 
 
 
provided the log-rank test for PFS had demonstrated statistical significance in both hormone receptor 
positive cohort and FAS. 
It was recognized that the information fractions at the interim analyses may not be as planned. The 
stopping boundary was to be updated based on the actual information fraction at the interim analyses. 
Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
The primary efficacy endpoint, and the key secondary efficacy endpoints were to be tested 
hierarchically to maintain the overall two-sided type-I error rate to 0.05 or less, in the order below: 
1. PFS based on BICR in the hormone receptor positive cohort 
2. PFS based on BICR in the FAS 
3. OS in the hormone receptor positive cohort (up to 3 analyses) 
4. OS in the FAS (up to 3 analyses) 
The statistical testing for a key secondary endpoint was to be performed only when the analyses in the 
hierarchy above the current endpoint had demonstrated statistical significance.

Source SAP v2.0 page 74/152 
Four changes made to the analytic conventions after the finalization of SAP v2.0 on 04 Jan 2022 
(before database lock date of 08 Feb 2022) were implemented without a SAP addendum: as 
summarized below. 
1. Added subject disposition for HR-positive cohort and HR-negative cohort. 
2. Added summary of major protocol deviation for HR-positive cohort. 
3. PFS follow-up (time from the PFS end date to DCO in weeks) and OS follow-up (time from the OS 
end date to DCO in months) were to be summarized for total patients, instead of “by treatment arm”. 
4. Added subgroup analysis for selected TEAE and grouped terms.

Recruitment 
From 21 Dec 2018 to the DCO of 11 Jan 2022, 557 patients were enrolled from study sites in the 
United States (27), Japan (18), France (16), China (15), Italy (13), Spain (12), Greece (8), Portugal 
(8), Republic of Korea (8), Israel (6), Switzerland (6), Austria (4), Belgium (4), Russia (3), Sweden 
(3), Taiwan (3), United Kingdom (3), Canada (2), and Hungary (2). Median duration of follow (study 
duration) as of DCO: 16.1 months in the T-DXd arm and 13.5 months in the TPC arm. 
Conduct of the study 
After the initial release (Version 1.0, 23 Aug 2018), the study protocol was amended 4 times. Key 
changes in each amendment were as follows: 
Amendment 1 (Version 2.0) - 23 Nov 2018, Before the First Subject Signed an ICF 
The primary changes made by Amendment 1 were as follows: 
• Added information on T-DXd dosing (starting dose, infusion time for initial dose, and dose 
modifications) 
• Updated text regarding Screening to be within 14 days of randomization 
• Clarified prohibited medications and treatments for T-DXd and TPC 
• Updated CBR to include at least 6 months’ SD 
• Clarified inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 62/139 
 
 
 
• Added HEOR questionnaires at Cycle 2 Day 1 
• Updated AESI wording to reflect the latest T-DXd safety profile 
• Clarified the EOT visit timing and updated the 40-day Follow-up and Long-term/Survival Follow-up 
visits to allow for a window of ±7 days. 
Amendment 2 (Protocol Version 3.0) - 24 Apr 2019, During the Course of the Study 
The primary changes made by Amendment 2 were as follows: 
• Clarified tissue biopsy text regarding archival and fresh sample requirements 
• Increased the number of study centers to approximately 255 sites 
• Clarified the number of hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative subjects with and 
without prior therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor to be enrolled in the study 
• Added statement that the investigator should follow the locally approved label for the individual 
treatment options for subjects randomized to the TPC arm 
• Updated the inclusion criterion related to hormone receptor-positive subjects 
• Updated the criterion for recalculating a subject’s dose based on a change in body weight 
• Updated the inclusion criterion related to male and female subjects of reproductive/childbearing 
potential 
• Amended the ILD monitoring/management instructions. 
Amendment 3 (Protocol Version 4.0) - 23 Apr 2020, During the Course of the Study 
The primary changes made by Amendment 3 were the clarification that tumor assessments were to be 
conducted every 6 weeks from randomization and clarification regarding the TPC dose regimens. 
Amendment 4 (Version 5.0) - 12 Oct 2020, During the Course of the Study 
The primary changes made by Amendment 4 were as follows: 
• Added new timepoints for OS analyses. The study was originally designed to perform OS analysis at 
the same time as the final PFS analysis. This early analysis would not have provided adequate follow-
up and statistical power to detect a statistically significant difference in OS. Therefore, the protocol was 
amended to include OS as a key secondary endpoint with adequate follow-up to provide statistical 
power to detect meaningful improvement in OS between the 2 treatment arms. 
• Added PFS2 as an exploratory objective and endpoint. 
• To evaluate the impact of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, added an analysis to identify 
subjects affected by COVID-19, and updated the analysis plan to identify the impact of COVID-19 on 
study conduct, efficacy, and safety. 
Contingency Measures Implemented to the Conduct of the Study as a Result of the COVID-
19 Pandemic 
Changes in Collection of Data 
Because of site closures and travel restrictions, 4 subjects were transferred to another existing study 
site or satellite site that was different from the site at which the subject originally enrolled. In such 
cases, the transfer was initiated by the investigator. Study activities, including drug dispensing and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 63/139 
 
 
 
dosing for each subject, were performed per protocol at the transfer site. Modification of study 
procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was not necessary. 
Changes in Monitoring/Oversight 
Risk-based/remote monitoring activities were initiated at the beginning of the study. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, based on site and/or country policy, on-site monitoring visits were not conducted 
if sites could not accept visitors. During this time, on-site monitoring visits were replaced with remote 
visits/more frequent remote monitoring and telephone contacts were made where permissible by local 
regulations. Monitors used virtual monitoring visits to reinforce AE reporting and timely data entry. 
Targeted source data verification was the primary task during these on-site visits, focusing on primary 
efficacy and key safety data points. At the time of the primary analysis database lock, targeted source 
data verification could not be completed for some sites due to site access limitations as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The risk to data quality was considered minimal, as alternative methods of risk-
based monitoring/central monitoring of data review and data cleaning activities were conducted over 
the course of the study.

Exploratory endpoint – Patient-related outcomes (PRO) 
In both arms, compliance for questionnaires was >92% at baseline and >80% for Cycle 2 through 
Cycle 27. Data from the QLQ-C30 questionnaire showed that all scales either remained stable or 
improved up to Cycle 33, after which the number of subjects became too small to allow for meaningful 
interpretation. The global health status/global QoL score of the QLQ-C30 (the primary PRO variable of 
interest) remained stable over time for subjects in both treatment arms up to and including Cycle 21, 
indicating that HRQoL was maintained throughout treatment.   
There was a delay in TTDD by at least 10 points in the T-DXd arm compared with the TPC arm for the 
following:  
•  QLQ-C30  global  health  status  scale:  the  median  TTDD  by  at  least  10 points  in  global  health 
status/global QoL scale score was 7.6 months (95%CI: 5.8, 9.2) in the T-DXd arm vs 5.1 months 
(95% CI: 3.1, 6.9) in the TPC arm (stratified HR: 0.71 [95%CI: 0.56, 0.92]).   
•  QLQ-C30 pain symptom sub-scale: the median TTDD by at least 10 points in pain symptoms was 
9.7 months (95%CI: 8.5, 11.1) in the T-DXd arm vs 4.4 months (95% CI: 2.8, 6.2) in the TPC 
arm (stratified HR: 0.51 [95%CI: 0.39, 0.65]).  
•  QLQ-C30  physical  functioning  sub-scale:  the  median  TTDD  by  at  least  10 points  in  physical 
functioning was 9.2 months (95%CI: 7.6, 11.3) in the T-DXd arm vs 4.9 months (95% CI: 4.0, 
6.1) in the TPC arm (stratified HR: 0.54 [95%CI: 0.42, 0.70]). 
•  QLQ-C30 emotional functioning sub-scale: the median TTDD by at least 10 points in emotional 
functioning was 11.3 months (95%CI: 9.9, 13.8) in the T-DXd arm vs 6.3 months (95%CI: 5.7, 
7.9) in the TPC arm (stratified HR: 0.64 [95%CI: 0.48, 0.85]). 
•  QLQ-C30 social functioning subscale: the median TTDD by at least 10 points in social functioning 
was 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.9, 9.2) in the T-DXd arm vs 4.4 months (95%CI: 2.8, 5.8) in the 
TPC arm (stratified HR: 0.67 [95%CI: 0.53, 0.86]).

symptoms was 20.3 months (95%CI: 15.3, NE) in the T-DXd arm vs NE (95% CI: 10.5, NE) in 
the TPC arm (stratified HR: 0.71 [95%CI: 0.50, 1.01]).  
•  QLQ-BR45  (BR23)  arm  symptoms  sub-scale:  the  median  TTDD  by  at  least  10 points  in  arm

Biomarker analysis 
The eligibility criteria for Study U303 required pathologically documented BC that was centrally 
assessed as having low HER2 protein expression using an Investigational Use Only (IUO) version of the 
PATHWAY/VENTANA HER2 (4B5) with a revised HER2-low scoring algorithm. The reagent formulation 
remained the same as the commercially available PATHWAY/VENTANA HER2 (4B5). Of note, the only 
difference between the IUO version of the assay used in this study and the approved assay will be the 
investigational scoring algorithm for the lower cut point bound on the HER2 IHC 1+ category. HER2 
ISH testing will follow the scoring criteria specified in the package insert of Ventana INFORM Dual ISH 
kit. 
To define low HER2 expression, it is necessary to clarify the boundary between IHC 0 and IHC 1+. The 
ASCO-CAP suggests a definition for IHC 1+ as incomplete membrane staining that is faint/barely 
perceptible and within >10% of the invasive tumour cells. The IHC 0 is defined as no staining observed 
or membrane staining that is incomplete and is faint/barely perceptible and within ≤10% of the 
invasive tumour cells. Because there is no difference in treatment algorithm for subjects with IHC 0 
and IHC 1+ readings, several commercial HER2 tests use alternative cutoffs. To standardize this 
boundary, the Sponsor used the adapted ASCO-CAP cutoffs to provide the lower boundary for low 
HER2 expression. The scoring algorithm was revised to define the upper and lower boundary of low 
HER2 expression by using standard ASCO/CAP IHC definitions. The upper boundary for HER2-low 
(IHC 2+) remained the same as the lower boundary for HER2-positive BC. The lower boundary of 
HER2-low expression was defined as IHC 1+.  
Analytical validation of the HER2-low cutoff was performed by Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. 
Analytical sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, immunoreactivity, cut-slide stability, 
intermediate precision, reader precision, and reagent stability were evaluated. All analytical 
performance studies conducted for HER2-low on the PATHWAY/VENTANA HER2 (4B5) assay met their 
prespecified acceptance criteria. The clinical validity of the assay was studied in Study U303 by its use 
for patient eligibility determination.   
Reflex HER2 ISH testing of IHC 2+ cases was performed by using the INFORM HER2 Dual ISH Assay. 
The ISH assay reagent formulation remained unchanged and the assay was used according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.  
Both local and central results were available for 1201 tumour samples submitted for central testing for 
determination of HER2 expression. The overall percent agreement between local and central HER2-low 
assessment was 0.75 (95% CI 0.73, 0.78).

Supportive study 
Study J101 was a Phase 1 first-in-human, multicenter, 2-part (dose escalation followed by dose 
expansion), open-label, nonrandomized, multiple-dose study of T-DXd in subjects with advanced solid 
tumors.  The study was conducted in the US and Japan in several types of solid tumors at various 
doses of T-DXd ranging from 0.8 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg. 
Results from patients with HER2-low breast cancer (n=54) from the phase I study J101 serve as 
supportive evidence. Of note, only 21 patients received the proposed dose of 5.4 mg/kg Q3W.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The data from Study U303, PopPK analysis and ER analyses support the chosen dose of 5.4 mg/kg. 
The efficacy assessment of the applied extension of indication is based on the pivotal study Destiny 
Breast04 (Study U303), which is a phase 3, randomised, open-label two-arm study comparing 
trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) head-to-head with single-agent chemotherapy per Physician’s choice 
(TPC) for the treatment of HER2-low unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. TPC included the 
currently recommended SOC in the proposed settings, which is single-agent chemotherapy using either 
capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. As pointed out by the Scientific Advice 
given in 2018, the use of gemcitabine monotherapy is not endorsed in the proposed setting; however, 
it is considered acceptable and among the standard options used in the EU for the treatment of 
metastatic breast cancer. The SA also pointed out that prior anthracycline therapy ought to have been 
given prior to inclusion to the pivotal study, and while this is not specifically mentioned in the in- or 
exclusion criteria, it was a requirement that included patients must have had received chemotherapy in 
the metastatic setting or have developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing 
adjuvant chemotherapy, which would probably have included an anthracycline-based chemotherapy. 
Single-agent chemotherapy according to physician’s choice was to be determined prior to 
randomisation which is endorsed. The MAH did not consider anthracyclines as comparator as these are 
commonly given in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting, rendering patients ineligible for further 
anthracycline therapy in the metastatic setting. Furthermore, the risk for cardiotoxicity with cumulating 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 96/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose limits long term treatment. This appears reasonable; however, as about two-thirds of patients 
received prior anthracycline treatment, anthracyclines might have been a suitable comparator for part 
of the patients. A post-hoc sensitivity analysis showed that the beneficial effect of T-DXd was observed 
independent of prior anthracycline use, which is reassuring. Information on prior anthracycline use has 
been added to section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
This extension of indication is for treatment of patients with HER2-low unresectable or metastatic 
breast cancer, who have received one prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed 
disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy, i.e. both the 1L 
and the 2L setting. The percentage of patients who had prior anthracycline use in the (neo)adjuvant 
setting was 46.3% and 19.4% in the locally advanced and/or metastatic setting. In the metastatic 
setting, patients had a median of 3 prior lines of systemic therapy (range: 1 to 9) with 57.6% having 1 
and 40.9% having 2 prior chemotherapy regimens; 3.9% were early progressors (progression in the 
neo/adjuvant setting). In HR+ patients, the median number of prior lines of endocrine therapy was 2 
(range: 0 to 9) and 70% had prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment. The newly proposed indication does not 
totally reflect the included study population in the pivotal trial in terms of endocrine therapy. For 
example, a third of the patients included have had 2 prior lines of endocrine therapy in the metastatic 
setting. In addition, 22.4% of subjects received subsequent endocrine therapy either as single agent or 
in combination after completion of T-DXd treatment (data not shown). It is also acknowledged that the 
treating physician may have reasons to treat with chemotherapy, e.g., when there is rapid progression 
and imminent organ failure (typically due to liver metastases), because a rapid response is needed and 
the response from endocrine therapy occurs more slowly (Gennari et al. ESMO. 2021). Moreover, there 
is no reason to doubt effectiveness of T-DXd in patients who did not receive any prior lines of 
endocrine therapy, so it is considered acceptable to extrapolate the efficacy to patients, who are not 
previously treated with endocrine therapy. 
Low HER2 expression was defined as IHC2+/ISH- or IHC1+ (ISH- or not tested) according to 
ASCO/CAP guidelines per central assessment using the most recent tumour tissue sample available, 
which is endorsed. Although there was a slight difference in the wording of the HER2 1+ definition 
between the ASCO/CAP guidelines, the protocol for the pivotal study, and the pathologist training 
material used to train DB-04 central pathologist, it is considered that the definitions are similar. This is 
agreed since the slight difference is only in the wording, not in the interpretation of the staining. In 
both definitions, the % of cells presenting such staining intensity needs to be >10%.  
All patients had to have a history of low HER2 expression; however, the concordance rate between 
central and local testing was only 75%.  According to the Applicant, differences in testing 
methodologies and/or local scoring criteria, lack of local pathologist training for determination of HER2-
low scores, and intrasubject tumour heterogeneity are some of the factors that would likely have 
contributed to the observed differences between local and central assessment of HER2 expression. 
Although this is acknowledged, the data indicate that there could be a risk that patients may be 
selected erroneously for treatment with T-DXd based on unvalidated local tests. As no information was 
available for patients with discordant results on timing of local test compared to central test and prior 
therapies, the reasons for the discordant results remain unknown. As most patients had an archival 
tissue sample for HER2 determination, there is no need to request for fresh tissue samples in the 
SmPC. In the pivotal study, there were two reasons for tumour tissue collection (HER2 and exploratory 
biomarker analysis) with different timings of collection. Tumour samples for HER2 testing per inclusion 
criterion 5 allowed archival tissue prior to last treatment whereas samples for biomarker analysis per 
inclusion criterion 6 were mandatory after most recent treatment.  
Patients were recruited from 19 countries and the median follow-up was 16.1 months in the T-DXd 
arm vs 13.5 months in the TPC arm at the DCO of 11 January 2022. A total of 713 patients were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 97/139 
 
 
 
screened and 557 were randomised 2:1 to the two treatment arms and this is an acceptable sample 
size.  Most patients randomised to the TPC arm received eribulin (51%) followed by capecitabine 
(20%). Each of the other products made up 8-10% of the TPC arm.  
Randomisation was stratified by HER2 IHC status (1+ or 2+), number of prior chemotherapies (1 or 
2), and hormone receptor/CDK status (HR+ with CDK4/6 (min 240), HR+ without CDK4/6 (max 240), 
HR- (about 60)). The stratification factors are endorsed as these might influence efficacy.  
Main exclusion criteria were prior treatment with an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of a 
topoisomerase I inhibitor, uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, history of (non-infectious) 
interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis that required steroids, current or suspected 
ILD/pneumonitis, clinically severe pulmonary compromised resulting from intercurrent pulmonary 
illnesses, and spinal cord compression or clinically active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. 
These are in line with previous Enhertu studies and adequately described in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The pivotal study was fully recruited in approximately 4 years and a relevant fraction of the patients 
has been recruited from an EU like population (~60%). The presented data are from the primary 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of blinded independent central review (BICR)-assessed 
progression-free survival (PFS).  
The scientific advice given from CHMP in 2018 recommended to consider OS as a primary endpoint and 
to power the study to obtain robust OS data. The MAH designed the study to achieve at least 80% to 
test OS, which is endorsed. Of note, 60 subjects with hormone receptor-negative BC were enrolled for 
exploratory purposes, which is in line with the CHMP recommendations given during the scientific 
advice. The inclusion of HR-negative patients is endorsed; however, a larger sample size would have 
been preferred for a more accurate estimation of the effect size in this subgroup.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of PFS was assessed by BIRC using RECIST v1.1 in the hormone 
receptor-positive cohort (HR+) and the key secondary endpoint was PFS by BIRC in all randomised 
patients (FAS) and OS in both populations. Other secondary endpoints were PFS as assessed by the 
investigator, confirmed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) and PFS on 
next-line treatment by the investigator (PFS2). The primary and secondary endpoints are acceptable 
and established in the current setting. The primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary efficacy 
endpoints were tested hierarchically to maintain the overall 2-sided Type I error rate of 0.05 or less 
and the statistical methods used are acceptable. 
After the initial release (v1.0, 23 Aug 2018), the study protocol was amended 4 times. Most changes 
related to clarifications and updates to the inclusion criteria. The main change was with amendment 4 
(v5.0, 12 Oct 2020) adding two interim analyses for OS (originally OS analysis at time of final PFS 
analysis) to ensure adequate follow-up and statistical power. The Applicant clarified that no 
information from Study U303 was used or available at the time of protocol amendment 4. 
Furthermore, the rationale for the amendment was to provide adequate follow-up and statistical power 
to detect a statistically significant difference in OS with a clinically meaningful improvement of 6 
months over the expected SoC survival of 15 months and the revision of the OS assumptions was 
based on updated OS analysis from Study DS8201-A-J101. Moreover, the timing of the first IA for OS 
was dependent on the final analysis for PFS, which was unchanged during the study conduct. The 
timing of the planned second IA of OS was based on the assumed hazard ratio=0.72 and the median 
OS for the TPC arm of 15 months. The second IA for OS was planned with 70% IF relative to the target 
number of PFS events at the final analysis. This is acceptable. 
Because the Applicant is seeking an indication regardless of HR status, the FAS is the main focus of the 
assessment. Baseline characteristics in the FAS (T-DXd vs TPC) showed that the median age was ~57 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 98/139 
 
 
 
 
and 56 years with ~78% and 74% of the patients being less than 65 years old and ~22% and 26% of 
the patients were ≥65 years, which is considered reflective of the targeted patient population. Two 
male patients were included, both in the T-DXd treatment arm, which is acceptable since breast cancer 
is rare in men. Moreover, the results from the pivotal trial are considered extrapolatable to men with 
HER2-low breast cancer based on the common biological and pharmacological rationale in line with 
previous EMA decisions. There is limited data in patients older than 75 years as already reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Most patients were from Europe or Israel (44.5% vs 46.2%) or Asia (39.4% and 35.9%, respectively), 
so the majority of the patients were White or Asian. Hence, the fraction of European patients is 
acceptable for interpretation of the study results in an EU context. 
More than half of the included patients had received 1 prior line of chemotherapy, while 43.2% and 
44% of the patients had 2 prior lines of chemotherapy. Regarding endocrine therapy, many patients 
had already received two (~30%) or ≥3 (~24%) prior lines of endocrine therapy. The number of 
patients who had received 2 prior lines of chemotherapy and/or ≥3 lines of endocrine therapy may be 
slightly more than what could be expected; however, the study population is considered reflective of 
the overall targeted patient population. Approximately two-thirds (~62%) of the patients had hormone 
receptor (HR)-positive tumours and had received a CDK4/6 inhibitor, which is the current SoC, while 
26% had HR+ tumors but did not receive a CDK4/6 inhibitor in addition to their endocrine therapy. 
The latter is considered higher than what would be expected in a European population based on 
current treatment guidelines. Approximately 11% of the FAS had HR-negative disease, since the 
number of included patients with HR- tumors was capped, a higher number would have been preferred 
for a more robust estimation of the effect size. Information on baseline characteristics is, in general, 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
The majority of the patients had a history of visceral metastases (89.0% and 85.3%), with presence of 
liver (71.3% vs 66.8) or lung metastases (32.2% vs 34.2%) at baseline. BRCA status was missing in 
more than 60% of the patients, so the efficacy of T-DXd in the low number of patients with a BRCA1/2 
mutation at baseline cannot be firmly concluded. Relatively few patients had CNS metastases at 
baseline (5.7%), which is considered reflective of the study population, who had mostly HR+ disease.  
Baseline characteristics in the HR- cohort were in general comparable to the overall study population, 
although the proportion of patients receiving 1 prior line was lower and more patients had ECOG 1 in 
the HR- population. Also, baseline characteristics were largely comparable between treatment arms, 
although numbers were small in each arm. It is noted that there were four patients in each treatment 
arm who had an HR+ status for the electronic data capture (EDC) but not for interactive web/voice 
response system (IXRS; these were all HR-).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint was met and the primary analysis of PFS by BIRC in the HR+ population 
showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement from 5.4 months (95%CI: 4.4; 
7.1) with TPC to 10.1 months (95%CI: 9.5; 11.5) with T-DXd, HR 0.51 (95%CI: 0.40; 0.64). The data 
is mature with 63.7% events in the active T-DXd arm and 67.5% events in the control arm. The KM 
curves for PFS by BIRC separate early and remain separated. The performance of the control arm is 
considered within the expected range for the 2L+ setting as the study population in Destiny Breast04 
was heavily pre-treated. In context, the median PFS was 6 months in the 2L setting after one line of 
chemotherapy (MONARCH1) and only a median PFS of 3.7 months was shown for a pooled analysis 
from two phase 3 studies (Eribulin vs TPC or capecitabine in a 2L+ setting of HER2-negative MBC). 
Assessment report

Sensitivity analyses conducted on the PFS and those assessing the impact of stratification and 
censoring rules were consistent with the primary analysis (HR ranging from 0.44 to 0.53), showing PFS 
benefit for T-DXd over TPC. A post-hoc sensitivity analysis of PFS by BICR in the hormone receptor-
positive cohort to assess the impact of censoring due to withdrawal of consent showed no impact on 
the outcome of the PFS analysis. 
Median PFS based on investigator was 9.6 months (95% CI: 8.4, 10.0) in the T-DXd arm compared 
with 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.4, 4.9) in the TPC arm (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.47). The overall 
concordance rates of PFS between investigator and BICR assessment were about 80% in both arms. A 
post-hoc sensitivity analysis including both BICR-assessed and investigator-assessed PD (whichever 
occurred first) confirmed robustness of results.  
The secondary endpoint of PFS by BIRC in the FAS also showed a statistically significant and 
clinically relevant improvement from 5.1 months (95%CI: 4.2; 6.8) with TPC to 9.9 months (95%CI: 
9.0; 11.3) with T-DXd, HR 0.50 (95%CI: 0.40, 0.63). These results were similar to those from the 
HR+ population, which can be expected as the HR+ subgroup constitutes 90% of the FAS. The data 
from the FAS were also mature with 65.1% events in the active T-DXd arm and 69% events in the 
control arm and the KM curves also separated early and remained separated .  
PFS in the HR- population was 6.6 months (95%CI: 4.1, 11.7) in the T-DXd arm vs 2.9 months 
(95%CI: 1.4, 4.0) in the TPC arm, HR 0.45 (95%CI: 0.23, 0.87). Hence, the PFS was shorter in both 
arms, which is considered to be due the generally poorer prognosis of the HR- population. 
Nevertheless, the difference in PFS between the two arms is considered clinically relevant and these 
results are considered supportive of the primary endpoint and the claimed hormone-receptor-agnostic 
indication.  
The key secondary endpoint of overall survival in the HR+ population and the FAS was statistically 
and clinically significantly improved at the time of the first IA with only 38.1% events with T-DXd and 
44.8% events in the control arm after 18.4 months of follow up. Hence, the median OS for the HR+ 
populations was 23.9 months (95%CI: 20.8, 24.8) in the T-DXd arm vs 17.5 months (95%CI: 15.2, 
22.4) in the TPC arm, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.86), while the median OS for the FAS was 
23.4 months (95%CI: 20.0, 24.8) in the T-DXd arm vs 16.8 months (95%CI: 14.5, 20.0) in the TPC 
arm, which is consistent with the results in the HR+ population. A difference in OS of more than 6 
months between the treatment arms is considered clinically meaningful. The MAH is recommended to 
submit the final OS analysis from Study U303, projected to occur in Q4 2024, post-authorisation when 
available (PAM-REC).  
In the HR- subgroup, the median OS was 16.6 months (95%CI: 11.3, NE) in the T-DXd arm vs. 10.3 
months (95%CI: 6.1, 15.2) in the TPC arm (HR: 0.63; 95%CI: 0.32, 1.23). Some uncertainty remains 
on the true effect size in the HR- subgroup due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, given the 
magnitude of the effect observed, the poor prognosis of the HR- patients and the mechanism of action 
of T-DXd, it is reasonable to assume that HR- patients will benefit from treatment and inclusion in the 
indication is sufficiently supported. Additional observational studies will be performed by the Applicant 
providing further data on effectiveness in the HR- subgroup.  
ORR by IRC for the FAS is also clinically and statistically significantly improved from 16.3% in the 
control arm to 52.3% with T-DXd, and the results were in line with those from the HR+ population. 
The induced responses were durable: median DoR was 10.7 months in the T DXd arm vs 6.8 months 
in the TPC arm, and since data was mature with ~57% and ~67 events in each arm, respectively, no 
updated data has been requested. ORR and median DoR also support a beneficial effect of T-DXd in 
the HR- subgroup.

A post-hoc sensitivity analyses in the HR- subgroup based on EDC confirmed a beneficial effect in this 
subgroup. 
The Applicant was advised to provide PFS 2 data. Approximately a third of the patients treated with T-
DXd in both populations had a second progression of disease on their next line therapy, while ~20% 
have died. There were slightly more patients who had a PFS2 event in the control arm compared to T-
DXd in both populations (~40%), but a similar fraction of deaths across the treatment arms, so there 
is no sign of a detriment for the patients treated with T-DXd. The PFS2 was 15.4 months for the T-DXd 
treated in the FAS compared to 10.5 months in the control arm, which is reassuring. PFS2 analysis for 
the HR- subgroup showed a gain in 4 months, supporting a beneficial effect.  
Subgroup analyses of PFS by BIRC in the FAS supported a benefit of T-DXd compared with TPC for 
important pre-specified subgroups including HR status, prior CDK4/6i treatment, number of prior 
chemotherapies, and IHC 1+ and IHC 2+/ISH- status. 
In addition, the OS benefit was observed across the majority of prespecified subgroups with point 
estimates of HR<1, except for the subgroup who received 1 prior line of ET (HR: 1.02, 95%CI: 0.58, 
1.80) and the subgroup with moderate renal impairment (HR: 1.91, 95%CI: 0.84, 4.36). Most patients 
on T-DXd in the moderate renal impairment subgroup died due to PD and only two patients had an AE 
as primary cause of death which is reassuring. Further, it is noted that the median PFS (23.6 months) 
in the TPC arm appears somewhat better than seen in other subgroups (mostly <20 months). Overall, 
there are no signs of a safety issue and results may be chance finding in this small subgroup (n=64). 
Information on somewhat worse safety profile in this subgroup, and especially occurrence of ILD, is 
already included in the SmPC.  
Patient-reported outcomes: There seems to be no detriment on QoL in patients treated with T-DXd 
compared to TPC and numerical increases in QoL may support the beneficial effect of T-DXd; however, 
the open-label study design precludes firm conclusions. Hence, the PRO results are not presented in 
the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal Study U303 showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant 
improvement of both progression-free survival and overall survival in the HR+ population and the ITT 
population (FAS) for treatment with T-DXd compared to treatment per Physician’s choice (TPC) in 
patients with HER2-low, unresectable or metastatic breast cancer treated with a prior chemotherapy. 
Supportive data are available in the HR- population, though some uncertainty remains on the true 
effect size in the HR- subgroup due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, given the magnitude of 
efficacy observed, the poor prognosis of the HR- patients and the mechanism of action of T-DXd, it is 
reasonable to assume that HR- patients will benefit from treatment and inclusion in the indication is 
sufficiently supported. The Applicant was recommended to provide the final efficacy data from the 
pivotal U303 study post-approval.

Per CTCAE, LVEF decrease was defined as follows:  Grade 2 = resting LVEF ≥40% to <50% or a 10% to <20% decrease from baseline; Grade 3 
= resting LVEF ≥20% to <40% or a ≥20% decrease from baseline; Grade 4 = resting LVEF <20%.   
a  Non-missing n was the number of subjects with both baseline and post-baseline data.  Percentages were calculated using the non-missing n as 
the denominator. 
b  ≥90% baseline since worst grade was defined as the highest post-baseline LVEF after the measurement with worst grade that was ≥90% of the 
baseline LVEF value. 
c  Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects having worst post-baseline LVEF at the specific grade.  If there was no LVEF 
measurement after the worst grade of LVEF, the subject was not included in the denominator.

Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set as the denominator.   
A death could be associated with multiple preferred terms.   
If a subject had multiple occurrences of the same PT, the subject was counted once for the specific PT.  If a subject had multiple PTs, the subject 
was counted in each of the different PTs. 
TEAEs are sorted by descending frequency in the T-DXd arm.

multiple PTs/grouped terms, the subject was counted in each of the different PTs/grouped terms. 
a  The PTs included in each grouped term are listed in Table 2.1. 
b  ILD includes events that were adjudicated as ILD and related to use of T-DXd or TPC.  Note that, per protocol, discontinuation was required for 
any subject with ≥Grade 2 ILD in the studies in the All BC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool except for Study J101 and Study U201, which used a 
different criterion for discontinuation due to ILD when the studies started:  prior to Study J101 protocol v11.0 (effective 25 Jan 2018) and prior

Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively, since the first approval of T-DXd in the US on 20 December 2019 through 
01 March 2022, 480,209 vials of T-DXd were distributed to hospitals/clinics worldwide (Austria, Brazil, 
Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Japan, Norway, Poland, 
Portugal, Puerto Rico, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and US).  
For the period from 20 December 2021 through 01 March 2022, a total of 840 new AEs meeting PBRER 
reporting criteria were reported; the majority (670) of those events were non-serious. Reported events 
were generally consistent with the established safety profile of T-DXd. There were no new safety 
findings during this period.     
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data has been provided for 883 patients that received trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) 5.4 
mg/kg in the breast cancer pool (BC pool). The other safety population of interest are patients from 
the pivotal study Destiny Breast04 or U303 (n=371 who received T-DXd). The size of the safety data 
available on patients who have received T-DXd at the proposed dose of 5.4 mg/kg Q3W is considered 
acceptable. The median treatment duration of T-DXd for in study U303 and the BC pool were 
8.21 months and 9.9 months, respectively. A total of 70% of the patients in the BC pool, which 
includes the T-DXd-treated patients from study U303, had an exposure of T-DXd for more than 6 
months and 43% were exposed for more than 12 months, which is acceptable and considered a 
relevant exposure for the safety assessment.  
Almost all patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study U303 and the 
most frequently observed adverse events in the T-DXd arm vs the TPC arm were nausea (76% vs 
30.2%), fatigue (53.6% vs 48.3%), vomiting (40.4% vs 13.4%), anaemia (38.5% vs 27.3%), and 
neutropenia (34.0% vs 52.3%). Alopecia was almost similar in both arms with T-DXd compared to TPC 
(39.6% vs 33.1%). GI toxicity of T-DXd was more frequent for most AEs such as constipation (34.0% 
vs 22.1%), decreased appetite (31.8% vs 19.2%) and diarrhoea (27.0% vs 22.1%). 
Thrombocytopenia and epistaxis were reported at a much higher incidence for T-DXd compared to TPC 
(25.6% vs 9.3% and 10.5% vs 1.2%, respectively). These incidences are in line with those reported in 
the BC pool and the SmPC. 
Treatment-related AEs with T-DXd vs TPC were also nausea (73% vs 23.8%), fatigue (47.7% vs 
42.4%), vomiting (34% vs 9.9%), anaemia (33.2% vs 22.7%) and neutropenia (33.2% vs 51.2%) of 
almost the same incidences as for the AEs. Gastrointestinal toxicity was markedly increased with T-
DXd vs TPC, and besides vomiting, AEs of decreased appetite (28.6% vs 16.3%), constipation (21.3% 
vs 12.8%) and decreased weight (12.4% vs 4.7%) were clinically significantly more commonly 
observed.  
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) was very commonly observed with T-DXd versus TPC (12.1% vs 
0.6%), and this high risk of ILD/pneumonitis with T-DXd is important information for the prescriber 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 127/139 
 
 
 
and should be considered if the patients had prior clinical lung problems (see SmPC section 4.2 and 
4.4). It should be noted that patients with a history of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis that required 
steroids, current ILD/pneumonitis, or suspected ILD/pneumonitis that could not be ruled out by 
imaging at screening were excluded from the pivotal Study U303, and this is adequately reflected in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Grade ≥3 AEs in the T-DXd arm vs the TPC arm were: neutropenia (14% and 41.3%), anaemia 
(10.2% and 5.2%) and fatigue (8.6% vs 4.7%). Hence, more high-grade neutropenia was observed 
with TPC while anaemia was more frequent with T-DXd. The incidences of the treatment-related grade 
≥3 adverse events were much in line with this. No major bleedings were seen within 14 days of any 
grade thrombocytopaenia among the patients from the T-DXd arm of Study U303 and the ‘All BC T-
DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool’ (see SmPC section 4.8).  
Adverse events of special interest include ILD/pneumonitis and Left ventricular dysfunction, 
which are important identified risks of treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan (see RMP section). ILD 
was as expected commonly observed in both the pivotal study U303 (12.4%) and in the BC pool 
(13.3%), and these events were most often of grade 2 (6.7% vs 7.6%). The majority of these events 
were assessed to be treatment-related (12.1% vs 12.7%) and often led to discontinuations (8.4% vs 
8.8%). Approximately half (55.6%) of the patients had recovered/resolved events of ILD, while 22.2% 
had not recovered/not resolved events. 2 patients (4.4%) died of ILD in study U303. This is not totally 
in line with what was reported for the BC pool, where deaths due to treatment-related ILD were even 
more frequent (7.1%), which is probably more in line with the true incidence. Lower frequencies of 
high-grade ILD compared to earlier studies are likely related to enhanced awareness and risk 
minimisation measures. However, it remains an important safety issue and the occurrence of drug-
related fatal cases stresses the importance of continuous monitoring of this AESI.  
Left ventricular dysfunction was observed as grade 2 decreased LVEF in 13.5% and 16.1%, or as 
grade 3 decrease of LVEF (0.4% and 0.2%), and the incidences were similar in the T-DXd arm and the 
BC pool, respectively. In the BC pool, 14.5% of the patients had a 10%-19% decrease in absolute 
value of LVEF, and only one patient had ≥20% increase in absolute value. It is noted that patients in 
the All BC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool the majority of discontinuations due to LV dysfunction were from 
Study U303 (3 out of 4). Also, the Grade 3 LVEF decreases in the All BC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool were 
mainly caused by patients from Study 303 (5 out of 7). In 12 of the 17 patients experiencing an event 
of LV dysfunction in the T-DXd arm of Study U303, there was a concurrent or underlying 
cardiovascular condition and/or other medical condition associated with increased cardiovascular risk. 
All 17 patients had previous exposure to at least one potentially cardiotoxic agents and 13 of the 17 
patients (76%) had previous lines of treatment with anthracyclines. Two events were Grade 3 and no 
Grade 4 or 5 events were reported. Regarding prior treatment with anthracyclines, in the All BC T-DXd 
5.4 mg/kg Pool 20 out of 34 patients (59%) with an event of LV dysfunction had prior anthracycline 
exposure. Prior treatment with anthracyclines could play a role in the development of LV dysfunction 
events, although the causality is likely multifactorial including comorbidity, prior and concurrent 
comedication, and T-DXd treatment. LVEF decrease is already an important identified risk for T-DXd 
and there were no new safety signals. No further additional measures are required at this point.   
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in 25.1% of the patients in the BC pool, which is 
similar to the incidences observed in the T-DXd arm (27.8%) and the TPC arm (25%). The most 
commonly observed SAEs in the BC pool and the T-DXd arm were interstitial lung disease (ILD) in 
4.19% vs 4.3% of the patients, respectively, and pneumonia (1.9% in both arms). The pattern was 
different for the TPC arm, where the most common SAEs were overdose (2.9%, febrile neutropenia 
and neutropenia (2.3% each), which is in line with the known toxicities of single-agent chemotherapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 128/139 
 
 
 
In the BC pool, 31.7% of the patients had died, most commonly due to disease progression (24.6%) 
and rarely due to an AE (2.3%) or other/unknown reasons (1.5%/3.4%). In the T-DXd arm of Study 
U303, 39.9% had died, 32.9% of disease progression and 2.7% of an adverse event. In comparison, 
more patients had died in the TPC arm, 45.9% of disease progression and no patients died from an 
adverse event. AEs associated with an outcome of death were reported in 3.8% of patients in the T-
DXd arm and 2.9% of patients in the TPC arm. Among these patients, the following AEs in the T-DXd 
arm were considered to be treatment-related by the investigator: pneumonitis in 2 patients, and colitis 
ischaemic, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, and sepsis in 1 
patient each. None of the deaths in the TPC arm were considered to be treatment-related. It is noted 
that 7 out of the 11 treatment-related AEs associated with an outcome of death in the All BC T-DXd 
5.4 mg/kg Pool were observed in Study U303. In addition, new treatment-related AEs leading to death 
were reported in Study U303, such as colitis ischaemic, disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
dyspnoea/pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, and sepsis. SmPC 4.4 and 4.8 has been updated to include 
the fatal cases of febrile neutropenia that were observed.   
Hence, treatment with T-DXd carries more severe toxicity. The narratives for the patients who died 
from other causes in the pivotal study were provided. The overall incidence of deaths due to adverse 
events could be considered acceptable for this non-curative treatment setting and considering the 
underlying metastatic breast cancer. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the BC pool was 16.2%, which is double as many 
compared to the TPC arm (8.2%), but in line with the rate for the T-DXd arm (16.2%). Most often, 
patients discontinued treatment due to ILD/pneumonitis in both the BC pool (8.8%) and the T-DXd 
arm (8.4%), which is in line with the known safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan and the incidence 
of ILD in other studies using the dosing of 5.4 mg/kg Q3W. Other reasons were left ventricular 
dysfunction, bilirubin increased, dyspnoea, and pleural effusion. In the TPC arm, the most common AE 
leading to discontinuations was peripheral neuropathy (2.3%). Overall, the rate of discontinuations is 
considered acceptable for the proposed extension of indication and targeted patient population.  
Laboratory findings were in line with the reported AEs and may also reflect that liver metastases are 
very common in the targeted patient population. Increasing toxicity of T-DXd was observed with 
increasing age regarding grade ≥3 AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) both in the pivotal study 
and the BC pool. However, the increased toxicity with age is considered acceptable. The higher 
incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged 65 years or older was already 
reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
It is noted that significantly more patients had an ADR of ≥grade 3 in the Asian population both for the 
T-DXd arms (51.7% vs 34.9%) and the BC pool. This may be explained by the known ethnic 
differences in drug toxicity, which is documented in the scientific literature where higher haematologic 
toxicity have been described for Asian vs. Non-Asian cancer patients. This was already reflected in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Hence, the overall toxicity observed with T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg is, in general, considered manageable and 
in line with what has previously been observed in other clinical trials and the incidences reflected in the 
BC pool. No new toxicities were observed in the pivotal study. The occurrence of fatal ILD/pneumonitis 
remains a major safety issue as reflected in the SmPC and RMP. Additional risk minimisation measures 
are in place to manage this risk.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based  on  safety  data  from  ~880  patients  with  breast  cancer  who  have  had  relevant  exposure  to  the 
approved  dose  of  trastuzumab  deruxtecan  (5.4  mg/kg  Q3W)  no  clinically  significant  changes  of  the 
Assessment report

known  safety  profile  nor  any  new  safety  findings  were  detected.  The  safety  profile  of  T-DXd  was 
compared  head-to-head  with  treatment  per  Physicians’  choice  of  single-agent  chemotherapy  in  the 
metastatic treatment setting, and the toxicities observed with TPC are considered clinically significantly 
different  from  those  observed  with  T-DXd.  Although  tolerability  of  T-DXd  appears  lower  compared  to 
single-agent chemotherapy, it remains mostly manageable. ILD/pneumonitis is still the greatest risk in 
the treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan and the occurrence of drug-related fatal cases stresses the 
importance of continuous monitoring of this AESI, as reflected in the SmPC and the RMP.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The posology, administration and method of reconstitution for the extension of the indication is 
unchanged. The updates to the PL, including the safety sections, are not significant and utilise well 
recognised lay terms. Furthermore, the PL will be kept in an identical format size, colours and 
layout/design. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer who have received 
prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 
months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease. Although treatment has improved disease 
outcomes over the years, the disease will invariably progress. The aim of therapy is to prolong 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Treatment outcomes with currently approved therapies in patients with metastatic HER2 negative 
breast cancer who progressed on at least 1 line of chemotherapy illustrate the high unmet medical 
need for new treatment options. No targeted therapy is specifically approved for patients with HER2-
low breast cancer (BC). The most recently approved single agents for patients with metastatic 
hormone receptor-positive HER2-low/negative BC, are abemaciclib and eribulin. Abemaciclib has since 
been approved in earlier lines of therapy and is rarely used in the proposed setting where the 
cornerstone of treatment remains conventional chemotherapy (Gennari et al. ESMO. 2021). For 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023

patients with TNBC who have received at least 2 previous regimens, with at least one of them in the 
metastatic setting, the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) sacituzumab govitecan is also approved.  
Despite available therapies,   the high unmet medical need for new therapeutic options that would 
provide a clinically meaningful delay in time to progression and improved survival remains. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The single pivotal study Destiny breast04 (Study U303) is a phase 3 randomised open-label two-arm 
study comparing trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) head-to-head with the current SOC in patients with 
HER2-low, unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer. 
Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive T-DXd or single-agent chemotherapy by Physician’s choice 
(TPC; capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel). 557 patients were recruited from 
19 countries. Randomisation was stratified by HER2 IHC status (ICH 1+ vs ICH2+/ISH negative), 
number prior lines of chemotherapy (1 vs 2), and HR/CDK4/6 status (HR+ with CDK4/6 (min 240) vs 
HR+ without CDK4/6 (max 240) vs HR- (max 60)). 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal trial was PFS by BIRC in the hormone receptor-positive cohort 
(HR+) and the key secondary endpoints were PFS by BIRC in all randomised patients (FAS) and OS of 
both populations. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The presented data are from the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of blinded 
independent central review (BICR)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) at DCO 11 January 2022. 
The median duration of follow-up was 16.1 months in the T-DXd arm vs 13.5 months in the TPC arm at 
the DCO. The primary endpoint was met and the primary analysis of PFS by BIRC in the HR+ 
population (n=494) showed a statistically significant improvement from 5.4 months (95%CI: 4.4; 7.1) 
with TPC to 10.1 months (95%CI: 9.5; 11.5) with T-DXd, HR 0.51 (95%CI: 0.40; 0.64). The data 
were mature with 63.7% events in the active T-DXd arm and 67.5% events in the control arm. The KM 
curves for PFS by BIRC separated early and remained separated. 
The key secondary endpoint of PFS by BIRC in the FAS (n=557) was improved from 5.1 months 
(95%CI: 4.2; 6.8) with TPC to 9.9 months (95%CI: 9.0; 11.3) with T-DXd, HR 0.50 (95%CI: 0.40, 
0.63). The data from the FAS were also mature with 65.1% events in the active T-DXd arm and 69% 
events in the control arm and the KM curves also separated early and stayed separated.  
The key secondary endpoint of overall survival in the HR+ population and the FAS was statistically 
significantly improved at the time of the first IA with 38.1% events with T-DXd and 44.8% events in 
the control arm after 18.4 months of follow up and the efficacy stopping boundary of 0.00748 was 
crossed. The median OS for the HR+ population was 23.9 months (95%CI: 20.8, 24.8) in the T-DXd 
arm vs 17.5 months (95%CI: 15.2, 22.4) in the TPC arm, HR 0.64 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.86), while the 
median OS for the FAS was 23.4 months (95%CI: 20.0, 24.8) in the T DXd arm vs 16.8 months 
(95%CI: 14.5, 20.0) in the TPC arm. 
Confirmed ORR by IRC was improved from 16.3% in the control arm to 52.3% with T-DXd in the FAS 
and the median DoR was 10.7 months in the T DXd arm vs 6.8 months in the TPC arm after ~57% and 
~67 events in each arm, respectively. 
In the HR- population (n=58), PFS was 6.6 months (95%CI: 4.1, 11.7) in the T DXd arm vs 2.9 
months (95% CI: 1.4, 4.0) in the TPC arm, HR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.87). Median OS was 16.6

months (95% CI: 11.3, NE) in the T-DXd arm vs 10.3 months (95% CI: 6.1, 15.2) in the TPC arm 
(HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.32, 1.23). Confirmed ORR by ICR was improved from 14.3% in the control arm 
to 47.6% in the T-DXd arm and median DoR was 8.6 months in the T-DXd arm vs 4.9 months in the 
TPC arm.   
Subgroup analyses of PFS and OS by BIRC in the FAS supported a benefit of T-DXd compared with TPC 
for important pre-specified subgroups including HR status, prior CDK4/6i treatment, number of prior 
chemotherapies, and IHC 1+ and IHC 2+/ISH- status. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There was a limited number of patients in the HR- cohort (n=40 T-DXd arm and n=18 TPC arm), 
leaving some uncertainty in the true effect size in this subpopulation. Sensitivity analysis based on 
electronic data capture data showed a beneficial effect. In addition, the Applicant plans additional 
observational studies which most likely will provide additional data in the HR- subgroup.  
A difference in OS of more than 6 months between the treatment arms is considered clinically 
meaningful. Based on the available data, a later detriment in OS is considered unlikely. Results from 
the final OS analysis are projected to occur in Q4 2024 and will be provided post-authorisation when 
available (PAM-REC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal Study U303, median treatment duration in Study U303 was 8.2 months for T-DXd and 
3.5 months in the TPC arm. 
Almost all the patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study U303 and the 
most frequently observed adverse events in the T-DXd arm vs the TPC arm were nausea (76% vs 
30.2%), fatigue (53.6% vs 48.3%), vomiting (40.4% vs 13.4%), anaemia (38.5% vs 27.3%), and 
neutropenia (34.0% vs 52.3). Alopecia was almost similar in both arms (39.6% vs 33.1%). 
Gastrointestinal toxicity of T-DXd was more frequent for most AEs such as constipation (34.0% vs 
22.1%), decreased appetite (31.8% vs 19.2%) and diarrhoea (27.0% vs 22.1%). Thrombocytopenia 
and epistaxis were reported at a much higher incidence for T-DXd compared to TPC (25.6% vs 9.3% 
and 10.5% vs 1.2%, respectively). These incidences are in line with those reported in the BC pool and 
the SmPC. 
Treatment-related AEs with T-DXd vs TPC were also nausea (73% vs 23.8%), fatigue (47.7% vs 
42.4%), vomiting (34% vs 9.9%), anaemia (33.2% vs 22.7%) and neutropenia (33.2% vs 51.2%) of 
almost the same incidences. Gastrointestinal toxicity was as mentioned markedly increased with T-DXd 
vs TPC, and besides vomiting, ADR of decreased appetite (28.6% vs 16.3%), constipation (21.3% vs 
12.8%) and decreased weight (12.4% vs 4.7%) were clinically significantly more commonly observed.  
Grade ≥3 AEs in the T-DXd arm vs the TPC arm were neutropenia (14% and 41.3%), anaemia (10.2% 
and 5.2%) and fatigue (8.6% vs 4.7%) which were consistent with. treatment related grade ≥3 
adverse events reported. 
Adverse events of special interest include ILD/pneumonitis and left ventricular dysfunction. ILD was 
commonly observed in both the pivotal study U303 (12.4%) and in the BC pool (13.3%), most often of 
grade 2 (6.7% vs 7.6%). Approximately half (55.6%) of the patients had recovered/resolved at DCO, 
while 22.2% had not recovered/not resolved events. 2 patients (4.4%) died of ILD. In the BC pool, 
deaths due to treatment-related ILD were even more frequent (7.1%). LVEF dysfunction was observed 
of grade 2 in 13.5% and 16.1%, or grade 3 decrease of LVEF (0.4% and 0.2%) and the incidences 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/14752/2023  
Page 134/139 
 
 
 
were similar in the T-DXd arm and the BC pool, respectively. All events except one with T-DXd were 
resolved at DCO. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in 25.1% of the patients in the BC pool, which is similar 
to the SAEs observed in the T-DXd arm (27.8%) and the TPC arm (25%). The most common SAE 
observed were interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonia. In the TPC arm, the most common SAEs 
were overdose, febrile neutropenia and neutropenia, which is in line with the known toxicities of single-
agent chemotherapy.  
In the BC pool, 31.7% of the patients had died, most commonly due to disease progression (24.6%) 
and rarely due to an AE (2.3%) or other/unknown reasons (1.5%/3.4%). In the T-DXd arm, 39.9% 
had died, 32.9% of disease progression and 2.7% of an adverse event. In comparison, more patients 
had died in the TPC arm, 45.9% of disease progression and no patients died from an adverse event. 
Regarding fatal AEs, 7 out of the 11 treatment-related AEs association with an outcome of death in the 
All BC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool were observed in Study U303. In addition, new treatment-related AEs 
leading to death were reported in Study U303, such as colitis ischaemic, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, dyspnoea, febrile neutropenia, and sepsis. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the BC pool was 16.2%, which is double as many 
compared to the TPC arm (8.2%), but in line with the rate for the T-DXd arm (16.2%) and was most 
commonly due to ILD/pneumonitis.  
Laboratory findings were in line with the reported AEs and may also reflect that liver metastases are 
very common in the targeted patient population. Increasing toxicity of T-DXd was observed with 
increasing age regarding grade ≥3 AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) both in the pivotal study and 
the BC pool. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data in patients >75 years, patients with severe renal impairment, and patients with 
moderate/severe hepatic impairment remain limited. These uncertainties have been reflected in the 
SmPC (see SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) compared to single-agent chemotherapy per 
Physicians’ choice (TPC) in the proposed setting after a prior systemic chemotherapy in the metastatic 
setting is considered clinically meaningful, since the primary endpoint of PFS by BIRC for the hormone-
receptor positive cohort was prolonged from 5.4 months to 10.1 months, HR 0.51. Similar results were 
observed for the FAS, as expected given that the HR+ cohort constituted about 90% of the FAS.  
OS was also clinically significantly improved for both the HR+ and the FAS populations (HR 0.64) and 
although data are only partly mature, a detriment in OS at a later time point is considered unlikely. 
The MAH is recommended to provide final efficacy data from the pivotal U303 study post-authorisation.  
PFS and OS results support a beneficial effect of T-DXd in the hormone-receptor negative cohort as 
well, although some uncertainty exists on the true effect size in the HR- cohort due to the small 
sample size. However, given the magnitude of the effect size (increase of 3.7 months in median PFS 
and 6 months in median OS) it is reasonable to exclude a detrimental effect compared to TPC. Further, 
Assessment report

although the prognosis is worse in the HR- cohort, it is unlikely that T-DXd would act differently in the 
HR- cohort compared to the HR+ cohort given the mechanism of action. Furthermore, post hoc 
sensitivity analyses showed a beneficial effect. The Applicant plans additional observational studies 
which most likely will provide additional data in the HR- subgroup.  
Overall, treatment options in HR- population are limited in this patient population. T-DXd could offer an 
alternative to existing therapies with a different safety profile.  
The safety profile of T-DXd was not significantly changed with added safety data from the pivotal study 
U303 and the most frequently reported adverse events of trastuzumab deruxtecan are haematological 
and gastrointestinal nature. The major safety concern continues to be the risk of ILD/pneumonitis 
(12.1%), which frequently led to drug discontinuation and was fatal in 4 cases. The current guidance 
for the handling of ILD/pneumonitis is considered adequately reflected in the SmPC. Also, a higher rate 
of LV dysfunction events was observed in the T-DXd arm compared to the TPC arm. This was already 
reflected in 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Overall, the toxicity of T-DXd is not negligible and the risk of fatal ILD/pneumonitis stresses the 
importance of continuous monitoring of this AESI. Most AEs are manageable and, overall, the safety is 
considered outweighed by the benefits associated with T-DXd in terms of PFS and OS improvement. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The shown improvement of PFS and OS are considered clinically relevant and outweigh the risks of 
treatment with T-DXd in the target population, including both HR+ and HR- patients. Though some 
uncertainty remains on the true effect size in the HR- subgroup due to the small sample size, given the 
magnitude of efficacy observed, the poor prognosis of the HR- patients and the mechanism of action of 
T-DXd, it is reasonable to assume that HR- patients will benefit from treatment and inclusion in the 
indication is sufficiently supported. Treatment with T-DXd carries more severe toxicity, which is 
considered to be outweighed by a lower risk of disease progression and death compared to standard of 
care (TPC).  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Low HER2 expression was defined as IHC2+/ISH- or ICH1+ (ISH- or not tested) according to 
ASCO/CAP guidelines per central assessment using the most recent tumour tissue sample available, 
which is endorsed. Although there was a slight difference in the wording of the HER2 1+ definition 
between the ASCO/CAP guidelines, the protocol for the pivotal study, and the pathologist training 
material used to train DB-04 central pathologist, it is considered that the definitions are similar. This is 
agreed since the slight difference is only in the wording, not in the interpretation of the staining. In 
both definitions, the % of cells presenting such staining intensity needs to be >10%. This has been 
reflected in SmPC 5.1. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Enhertu in the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low 
breast cancer who have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease 
recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy is positive.

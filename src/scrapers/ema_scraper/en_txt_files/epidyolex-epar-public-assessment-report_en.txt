2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Epidyolex is proposed for adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
(LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients from 2 years of age and older. 
Both LGS and DS are early onset encephalopathic epilepsies with a poor prognosis and substantial 
associated comorbidities. In particular, the affected children tend to exhibit developmental delay and 
cognitive impairment, often to a severe degree. These conditions have substantial unmet medical 
needs in the adequate treatment of epileptic seizures associated with LGS and DS, particularly in 
children. Additionally, cannabidiol (CBD, GWP42003-P) has received orphan drug designations in both 
indications. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS): Incidence approximately 1:4,000 births. Prevalence estimates 
uncertain possibly around 15/100,000. LGS is believed to account for 1-4% of all childhood epilepsies. 
Dravet Syndrome (DS): Incidence approximately 1:20,000 births. Prevalence estimates uncertain 
possibly around 3/100,000. DS is believed to account for approximately 7% of all severe epilepsies 
starting before the age of 3 years. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS): No single cause has been identified. About two-thirds of cases are 
considered to be related to an existing neurological condition e.g. abnormal development of the brain 
cortex (cortical dysplasia), congenital infections, stroke, trauma, reduced oxygen supply that occurs 
before birth (perinatal hypoxia), or infections of the central nervous system such as encephalitis or 
meningitis. 
Dravet Syndrome (DS): Between 70% and 80% of patients carry sodium channel α1 subunit gene 
(SCN1A) abnormalities. Truncating mutations account for about 40%. Other SCN1A mutations 
comprise splice-site and missense mutations, most of which fall into the pore-forming region of the 
sodium channel. Mutations are randomly distributed across the SCN1A protein. Most mutations are de 
novo, but familial SCN1A mutations also occur. The aetiology of about 20% of DS patients remains 
unknown, and additional genes are likely to be implicated. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The onset of Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) usually occurs between 3 and 5 years of age and is 
characterized by the presence of multiple seizure types (predominantly tonic, atonic, and atypical 
absence seizures), slow electroencephalogram spike-waves with abnormal background activity when 
awake, and fast polyspikes during sleep. Other seizure types may occur including generalised tonic–
clonic, focal, and myoclonic seizures. Seizures often persist into adulthood. All of these seizures types 
may progress to status epilepticus (SE) which may occur frequently in some patients with LGS, and 
carries great risks. Drop seizures are common and can lead to physical injury. Cognitive impairment is 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 12/190 
 
apparent in ≥ 75% by 5 years post onset and behavioural and psychiatric comorbidities (including 
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and aggressive behaviour) are common.  
Children and adolescents with LGS have an increased risk of death. A population-based study of 
children with epilepsy showed that all-cause mortality was 14 times greater in LGS than in the general 
population. Neurological comorbidity including prolonged seizures and SE are correlated with mortality 
and, in particular, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). 
Dravet Syndrome (DS), also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, is characterised by a 
variety of seizures (febrile and afebrile, generalized and unilateral, clonic or tonic–clonic) that occur in 
the first year of life. Onset usually occurs between 4 and 8 months of age and is often triggered by 
fever. In addition to convulsive seizures, other seizure types appear between the ages of 1 and 4 
years, including myoclonic seizures, focal seizures, and atypical absences. Status epilepticus (SE) may 
occur at initial presentation or later in the clinical course. By late childhood, the seizure profile will 
often have stabilised. Significant developmental delay becomes apparent from the second year 
onwards and associated neuropsychological disturbances, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, are common. Intellectual impairment affects nearly all patients and is severe in 50% of 
cases. Dependency in adulthood is a nearly constant feature of DS due to the chronic significant 
disability. Death during childhood is common and may be due to e.g. SUDEP or other causes. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Felbamate, lamotrigine (LTG), topiramate and rufinamide are approved in the EU as adjunctive therapy 
for treatment of LGS. Only stiripentol (STP), when taken in conjunction with sodium valproate (VPA) 
and clobazam (CLB), is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of DS; neither VPA nor CLB are 
approved for LGS or DS specifically, but both are approved for use in epilepsy in the EU, and widely 
used in both indications. In both indications, VPA is often used to prevent the initial recurrence of 
convulsive seizures, and benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam, or CLB) are 
frequently coadministered to limit the duration of long-lasting seizures. Second-line and later options in 
DS typically include STP, topiramate, ketogenic diet, levetiracetam (LEV), bromides, and vagus nerve 
stimulation (VNS), while LTG, rufinamide, lacosamide, and felbamate are also used in LGS. Polytherapy 
is common in both indications. Of note, patients with DS may be prone to seizure exacerbation with 
sodium channel modulators such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, LTG, phenytoin, and vigabatrin. 
In both indications, sufficient seizure control may be difficult to achieve. Most patients with LGS 
continue to experience drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), which has been noted to be as high as 90%. 
Thus, there is a need for new therapies with a different mode of action. 
About the product 
Cannabidiol (CBD) exhibits anticonvulsant properties in certain in vitro and in vivo seizure models. 
Anticonvulsant activity for the CBD metabolite 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD) has also been 
demonstrated. Based on these findings as well as preliminary encouraging reports of anticonvulsant 
effect in humans, larger placebo-controlled trials with CBD oral solution were performed. 
A 100 mg/ml CBD oral solution is the intended to-be-marketed formulation. Oral solutions facilitate 
dosing by volume, meaning dose can be customised for an individual patient’s body weight. As CBD is 
virtually insoluble in water, a lipid-based solvent (sesame oil) has been selected to enable solubility. As 
it is essential for paediatric medications to be palatable, CBD oral solution (CBD-OS) also contains a 
sweetener (sucralose) and strawberry flavouring. Sucralose is insoluble in sesame oil; as such, a co-
solvent was required. This resulted in a solution containing 10% (v/v), equivalent to 7.9% (w/v) or 79

mg/ml of anhydrous ethanol. In patients aged < 6 years dosing at 20 mg/kg/day, the amount of 
ethanol may exceed the EMA guidance threshold for ethanol containing medicines. This is adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as an oral solution containing 100 mg/ml of cannabidiol (CBD) as 
active substance. 
Other ingredients are: sucralose, anhydrous ethanol, refined sesame oil and strawberry flavour. 
The product is available in amber glass bottles with tamper-evident child-resistant polypropylene (PP) 
screw caps. As this is a multi-dose bottle, a bottle adaptor and two different-sized graduated oral 
syringes are provided for accurate administration. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of cannabidiol is 2-[(1R,6R)-3-methyl-6-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-yl]-5-
pentyl-1,3-benzenediol corresponding to the molecular formula C21H30O2. It has a relative molecular 
mass of 314.5 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1 Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of cannabidiol was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy and single crystal x-ray 
analysis. 
The active substance is a white to pale yellow crystalline, non-hygroscopic solid. Cannabidiol is 
practically insoluble in aqueous media irrespective of pH but freely soluble in some organic solvents, 
including ethanol, and in oils such as sesame oil. Both ethanol and sesame oil are included in the 
formulation. It is not photosensitive. 
Cannabidiol exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 2 chiral centres. These are introduced 
specifically within the biosynthetic pathway and are not susceptible to epimerisation during 
downstream processing.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Cannabidiol is synthesized in a single synthetic step from the milled botanical raw material (milled 
BRM) which is considered to be the starting material. Four different sites are involved in the production 
of the active substance. 
Cannabis plants produce various different cannabinoids and other organic compounds. The proposed 
manufacturing process for the active substance leads to isolation of CBD from the other cannabinoids 
and various other plant related materials. 
The starting material, milled BRM, contains cannabinoids present in the leaf and flower of one specific 
chemotype (3 genotypes) of the plant species, Cannabis sativa L. Only the female plants are used. The 
plants used for the production of the BRM are propagated from cuttings and cultivated in glasshouses 
under the controlled conditions in accordance with WHO guidelines on Good Agricultural and Collection 
Practices (GACP). The method of growing, harvesting and primary processing of the plant material has 
been well described. The decarboxylated BRM is then extracted. The crude extract undergoes 
winterization to remove plant waxes and other impurities. Pure CBD is crystallized from this refined 
extract. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Suitable specifications for milled BRM have been provided. In addition, the production of the milled 
BRM has been described, including controls on growth medium (controls for pesticides and heavy 
metals), and the quality of water for irrigation (potable or reservoir water is used exclusively). The 
milled BRM is produced in compliance with GACP. 
The initial process was based on extensive prior knowledge gained during commercialisation of a 
related product. The current process has been optimised during development with improvements to 
the extraction step, and final crystallisation. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  double  clear  LDPE  bags,  sealed  and  stored  within  HDPE  drums. 
The LDPE bags comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, HPLC), assay (CBD 
content by HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), and residue on 
ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3A  were  qualified  by 
toxicological  and  clinical  studies  and  appropriate  specifications  have  been  set,  also  considering  the 
ability of process to purge them. Other impurities were discussed, including other organic constituents 
from cannabis, pesticides, elemental impurities, microbial purity, aflatoxins, and residual solvents. The 
controls are deemed to be sufficient based on the data provided. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards has been presented.

Batch analysis data from 104 batches of the active substance were provided, including 29 production 
scale batches made using the commercial process and batches recrystallized at the commercial 
recrystallization sites. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 6 production scale batches of active substance (3 from each commercial site) from 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 12 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The parameters tested are the same as for release. In addition, supportive 
data on 3 pilot batches from one of the two proposed sites were provided, which were also tested for 
microbial quality, aflatoxins, melting point and specific optical rotation using compendial methods. No 
changes were seen to any of the measured parameters under either conditions, and no trends were 
observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. The results indicate 
that CBD is not photosensitive. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out under acidic, basic, oxidative, photolytic and thermal 
conditions. CBD is very stable, and significant degradation was only observed under thermal 
conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months below 30 oC in 
the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a multi-dose 100 mg/ml oral solution of CBD dissolved in a mixture of sesame 
oil and anhydrous ethanol, with sucralose as sweetener and with strawberry flavouring. The product 
comes in an amber glass bottle with tamper-evident child resistant screw cap. Two graduated 5 ml 
syringes and two graduated 1 ml syringes are provided for accurate dosing across the posology, along 
with bottle adaptors for the different syringe sizes, all of which are CE marked. 
The product is indicated for chronic diseases for patients aged 2 years old and above, based on body 
weight. Therefore, a dosage form was sought which allows flexibility in terms of posology and allows 
easy dosing to paediatric patients. The choice of an oral solution in a multi-dose container, with an 
administration device able to accurately dose across the posology range fulfils these requirements. 
The active substance is practically insoluble in aqueous media, but sufficiently soluble in the proposed 
commercial vehicle, i.e. a mixture of sesame oil and ethanol. 
Palatability of the product has been discussed and justified – sucralose was chosen from an array of 
sweeteners given its high sweetness intensity and stability in the vehicle at the required concentration. 
The strawberry flavour is added to further improve palatability. Ethanol is added to ensure that the 
sweetener, is dissolved in the vehicle. For safety reasons, the content of ethanol was initially 
questioned, especially as the product is indicated for paediatric use. However, this was justified and 
reference is made to the clinical safety report addressing this issue. The qualitative/semi-quantitative 
composition of strawberry flavour was provided to the regulatory authorities, and components were 
evaluated with respect to safety. 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 16/190 
 
Only benzyl alcohol and propylene glycol are listed in the annex to the EU COM labelling guideline, and 
the daily dose of propylene glycol is below the threshold. Since benzyl alcohol is a component of the 
flavouring and has known physiological effects, its quantity is listed in section 2 of the SmPC, along 
with sesame oil and anhydrous ethanol. 
Preservative efficacy testing was performed on the finished product to ensure its antimicrobial 
effectiveness (Ph. Eur. 5.1.3, Efficacy of Antimicrobial Preservation for oral preparations; USP „51” 
Antimicrobial Effectiveness) and results comply with acceptance criteria thus the effectiveness of the 
antimicrobial activity has been sufficiently proven. 
The stability of sesame oil was discussed in terms of peroxide value given the risk of rancidity. It has 
been demonstrated that the precautions to prevent oxygen ingress during manufacture and filling, and 
the commercial packaging and bottle adaptors provide sufficient protection and no anti-oxidant is 
needed. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The formulation used 
during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
Various development data for the packaging components were presented, including a study on 
extractables and leachables. Toxicological evaluation of the compounds identified was conducted and it 
has been demonstrated that there is no risk to patients from extractables or leachables. Inclusion of 
two different syringes in the same pack could be questioned, because of a potential risk of medication 
errors. On the other hand, the 5 ml syringe cannot be used for the small volume required for paediatric 
patients due to the presence of a dead space volume 0.15 ml, which could lead to significant 
overdosing. Therefore, the inclusion of two different syringe sizes in the same pack was accepted, 
because the need for both has been justified, and because of clear instructions given in the SmPC and 
packet leaflet. Ph. Eur. 2.9.27 (uniformity of mass of delivered doses for multi-dose containers) was 
applied to demonstrate reliable dosing accuracy of the syringes. The syringes are reusable and the 
cleaning procedure is described in the package leaflet. 
The manufacturing process is fairly simple and has only had minor modification throughout 
development and scale up. A risk assessment was conducted in line with ICH Q9 methodology, 
addressing factors relating to the active substance, process, excipients, container closure system, 
environment, and analytical aspects and no critical material attributes were identified. 
The primary packaging is an amber type III glass bottle, with PP screw cap and LDPE tamper-evident 
seal. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process, along with the IPCs, consists of six main steps: mixing of some excipients; 
addition of CBD; mixing with sesame oil followed by filtration under nitrogen blanket; filling and 
capping; labelling; assembly and secondary packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
The process has not been formally validated but a protocol has been included and the process will be 
validated on three consecutive production scale batches of finished product prior to marketing. It has 
been demonstrated through studies to date that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The IPCs are adequate for this type of 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 17/190 
 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. The lack of an IPC for CBD dissolution has been 
justified on the basis of experience with the process and the fact that no solid has been seen to date. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including appearance of solution, colour of solution, identification (IR, UPLC), assay (UPLC), degradants 
(UPLC), ethanol content (GC), water content (KF), uniformity of delivered dose (Ph. Eur.), 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.) and peroxide value (Ph. Eur.). 
Overall, the specification is set in agreement with ICH Q6A and the requirements in the European 
Pharmacopoeia for the pharmaceutical form. Impurities are tested in the active substance, and only 
degradation products of CBD are tested in the finished product, which is fully acceptable. The three 
degradation products have been qualified and are not genotoxic. A test for peroxide value was added 
to the specification at the request of CHMP, with different release and shelf-life limits, to ensure that 
the oral solution does not become rancid during storage and in-use. 
The absence of tests for viscosity, density and extractables/leachables has been adequately justified by 
the applicant. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The major source of 
contamination was likely to be the compost used to grow the cannabis plants. Heavy metals are limited 
in the specification for compost in accordance with the soil association organic standards, as well as in 
dried BRM (stage before the milled BRM starting material), which complies with compendial 
requirements for elemental impurities in herbal drugs. No test is deemed necessary in the finished 
product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for identity, assay degradation products testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results for 129 bathes are presented, including batches used in the clinical studies and 
three recent production scale batches. Since the process has not changed throughout development but 
the specification has evolved, all batches met with the specification in place at the time of testing. The 
results confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% 
RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Data from a further 3 
batches manufactured by an earlier process (which is considered essentially equivalent) and stored in 
slightly smaller (100 ml vs 105 ml) bottles was also provided, covering up to 24 months under long 
term and intermediate conditions. These supportive batches are considered to be representative and 
have been taken into account in the assessment. 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 18/190 
 
Samples were tested for appearance of solution and packaging, CBD content, degradants, density, 
peroxide value, acid value and microbiological quality. In addition, the primary batches were tested for 
colour of solution, and water and ethanol content. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. There was a small increase in total degradants over time, well within specification and the 
peroxide value increased slightly. All other parameters remained constant with no significant trends 
observed. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or 
significant negative trend in on-going stability studies should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products, confirming that the product is not light sensitive. 
A temperature cycling study was conducted to evaluate the impact of any temperature excursions 
during shipping and storage, including freezing. The changes in temperature had no significant impact 
on the quality of the product. 
An in-use study was conducted on three batches of product, with testing after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. 
Bottles were stored both vertically and horizontally and opened and sampled daily. There was a slight 
increase in impurities and peroxide value, reflecting oxygen ingress and reaction with the sesame oil. 
However, the values remained well below the shelf-life specification. However, the product posology 
requires twice-daily dosing, so a further in-use study was instigated at the request of CHMP. At the 
time of opinion, 4 weeks’ data was available, with impurity levels and peroxide value more or less in 
line with the same time-point from the original study. The in-use shelf-life has provisionally been set at 
8 weeks. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and in-use shelf-life of 8 weeks, 
both without special storage conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. It has been 
demonstrated that the bottle and syringes are suitable for routine use and that doses can be 
accurately administered. The formulation is sufficiently palatable for paediatric patients. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC and package leaflet. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the 
uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical data package contains an extensive number of non-clinical studies. The non-clinical 
testing strategy for purified CBD was in general undertaken in accordance with the guidance 
documents from the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) pertaining to non-clinical safety.  Non-clinical studies were conducted with CBD 
as CBD-OS, purified CBD, or CBD Botanical Drug Substance (BDS).   
Non-clinical scientific advices have been received from CHMP, BfArM Germany and Danish Medicines 
Agency. Recommendations received were followed to some extent.  
No novel excipients are used. 
Cannabidiol (CBD) molecule contains four stereoisomers but only the (–)-trans isomer occurs naturally 
or can be isolated as purified CBD. Providing that specific stereoisomeric properties may also influence 
the efficacy/safety of the molecule, all non-clinical studies were conducted with botanically-derived 
CBD. Synthetic CBD was not used in any reported non-clinical study. 
Based  on  a  MHRA  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  inspection  that  took  place  on  4-5  July  2017,  a 
notification  of  10  toxicology  multisite  studies  (GWTX:  1578,  1524,  1408,  1454,  1429,  1551,  1412, 
1503,  1413,  1579),  where  the  bioanalytical  and  toxicokinetic  phase  data  is  not  valid  and  certain 
bioanalytical and toxicokinetic data were not in compliance with GLP has been received.  The applicant 
has since made considerable efforts, including initiation of a long range of new studies, to mitigate the 
consequences of GLP deficiencies in the majority of pivotal toxicity studies, which overall is considered 
adequate.  
All 10 toxicology studies mentioned above are pivotal and represent almost the full data package for 
cannabidiol. Major deficiencies represent incorrect statements where GLP compliance was being made 
for study phases when the validation work to support the study activities was not completed.  For 
example, in bioanalytical phases various aspects of the method validation, such as cross interference, 
long term and some short-term sample storage stability was still on going and incomplete at the time 
the statements of GLP compliance were made. Furthermore, there were several examples within each 
compliance statement where the Principal Investigator had stated “that data should be treated with 
caution”. It is acknowledged that on the basis of the inspection, affected studies cannot be accepted as 
GLP compliant. Considering that this impacts a large number of pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, 
EFD studies,  most critical juvenile toxicity and abuse potential studies, an in-depth assessment has 
been conducted on bioanalytical reports of these studies (please see section pharmacokinetics) in order 
to evaluate the scientific value of the non-GLP data.  
It can be concluded that the exposure data for CBD seems to be reliable, while exposure of CBD 
metabolites (including active metabolite 7-OH-CBD and abundant human metabolite 7-COOH-CBD) 
may have been over- or underestimated. Despite the fact that accuracy of measured values for 
metabolites remains doubtful due to bioanalytical (GLP) issues, the results from the ten affected 
toxicokinetic studies are not totally erroneous and give us knowledge about the toxicokinetic profile in 
rat, mouse and dog into some extent. 
Based  on  the  data  from  study  GWTX18001  in  juvenile  rats,  it  is  evident  that  original  values  for 
metabolite  7-COOH-CBD  were  overestimated  resulting  in  almost  no  safety  margins  (from  3.2  to  1.4, 
combined  for  female  and  male  rats)  at  the  amended  NOAEL  of  150  mg/kg.  CBD  values  were 
overestimated too, however still resulting in high safety margins ~ 28-fold. There is almost no change 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 20/190 
 
in  values  for  7-OH-CBD  (from  2.75  to  2.4-fold)  comparing  Cmax  exposures  from  paediatric  study 
GWEP1332. 
During the communication with MHRA regarding GLP non-compliance studies, an independent review 
initiated by the Sponsor was indicated. The external review report was submitted. The review 
summarized the facts and bioanalytical issues. Conclusions provided in reports (CBD – metabolites) for 
all affected studies are in line with the initial non-clinical assessment. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated antiepileptiform and anticonvulsant activities in in 
vitro and in vivo models. In addition, these studies investigated the anticonvulsant mechanism of 
action of CBD. The observed anticonvulsant activity was achieved in the absence of motor system 
suppression that was observed with comparator antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the same assays.  
Anticonvulsant effect 
As CBD is intended for adjunctive therapy, i.e. co-administered with conventional AEDs, studies 
investigating the effect of CBD co-administered with AEDs were conducted. 
The  Applicant  demonstrated  antiepileptiform  activity  in  an  in  vitro  model  with  rat  hippocampal  slice 
preparations  at  10  µM  concentration  (3.1  µg/ml).  This  effect  was  comparable  to  those  obtained  with 
clinically  used  AEDs  at  100-500  µM  (Hill  et  al,  2010).  The  applicant  investigated  the  anticonvulsant 
effect  of  CBD  in  several  in  vivo  models  of  seizures  (see  table  1).  Exposure  was  estimated  using  the 
submitted  PK  studies  in  mice  and  rats  using  i.p.  as  the  route  of  administration  and  a  similar  vehicle. 
The  recommended  pharmacological  active  dose  of  20  mg/kg  in  humans  produced  mean  plasma 
concentrations in the range of 290-330 ng/ml in children and adults, respectively. Mice seem to be less 
sensitive to the anticonvulsant effects of CBD. However, the rat showed effects at lower doses in two 
out  of  three  models  (down  to  1  mg/kg),  all  though  the  highest  dose  of  100  mg/kg  gave  the  most 
convincing effects. CBD had a significant effect on welfare scores and survivability after subcutaneous 
administration (100 mg/kg) in a model of Dravet syndrome (Scn1a-/- mice) as compared to placebo or 
clobazam  (active  comparator).  Relevant  pharmacological  effects  of  CBD  were  adequately 
demonstrated, see Overview table below.

Mechanism of action 
Available literature studies on the mechanism of action of CBD in epilepsy was summarised along with 
the applicant’s proprietary studies. Currently there is an understanding that CBD can elicit its effect by 
influencing: 
• 
the G-protein coupled receptor GPR55, 
CBD might be acting as a GPR55 antagonist with an IC50 of 0.5 µM in vitro. CBD was shown to be 
able  to  antagonize  the  human  GPR55  receptor,  as  described  by  inhibition  of  agonist  L-α-
lysophosphatidylinositol-stimulated  extracellular  signal-regulated  kinase-1/2  phosphorylation  at  1 
µM (GWOR1059). CBD was shown to prevent the LPI (GPR55 endogenous ligand) induced GPR55-
receptor  mediated  increase  in  mEPSCs  frequency  in  hippocampal  slice  preparations  at  a 
concentration  of  10  µM.  No  dose-response  studies  were  presented  (GWORI1546).  GPR55  mRNA 
was found in a number of tissues with the highest mRNA levels detected in the adrenals, parts of 
the gastrointestinal tract, as well as in the CNS. As seen with CB1 receptors, a broad distribution 
of GPR55 mRNA is found in brain tissue, however the levels were significantly lower than those for 
CB1. 
• 
 the transient receptor channel TRPV1   
In  search  for  molecular  targets,  data  from  using  the  electrophysiological  patch  clamp  technique 
revealed  that  CBD  activated,  in  a  concentration-dependent  manner,  the  non-selective  cation 
current  mediated  by  TRPV1,  TRPV2  and  TRPA1  channels  transiently  expressed  in  human 
embryonic  kidney  293  (HEK-293)  cells.  Moreover,  using  this  approach  it  was  also  found  that 
TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPA1 channels became desensitized upon repeated or prolonged exposure to 
either CBD or CBDV (GWOR1209). This was substantiated by referring to the study by Petrocellis 
et al, 2011, showing CBD to desensitize TRPV1 channels for the capsaicin response with an IC50 of 
0.6 µM (0.2 µg/mL). 
• 
the extracellular levels of adenosine.  
CBD  inhibits  adenosine  uptake  into  macrophages  and  microglia  by  the  equilibrative  nucleoside 
transporter. CBD also inhibits synaptic uptake of adenosine in rodent striatal neurons, (see Figure 
2). Taken together, it is likely that CBD acts through modulation of adenosine-mediated signalling, 
probably act as a re-uptake inhibitor.

The plausible mechanisms of action by CBD in epilepsy was adequately summarised by the Applicant 
referring to both literature and proprietary data.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Off-target screening studies 
The secondary pharmacodynamic profile of CBD was evaluated in a series of in vitro radioligand 
binding and functional screening assays. Additional in vitro evaluations were conducted to assess 
effects within the endocannabinoid system with a specific focus on cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) 
and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2), endocannabinoid uptake, and inhibition of endocannabinoid 
metabolic enzymes. Modulation of synaptosomal monoamine transporters, voltage-gated sodium 
channels (Nav), and cyclo-oxygenase (COX) 1 and COX 2 were also assessed.  
It was shown that CBD and 7-OH-CBD are low potency uptake inhibitors of dopamine (DA), 
norepinephrine (NE), or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), whereas 7-COOH-CBD does not inhibit 
monoamine uptake. The applicant concluded that CBD acts as a low potency sodium channel blocker, 
but this is unlikely to represent a principal and functional anticonvulsant mechanism of action for CBD. 
This is consistent with recent clinical survey-based investigation of the effect of CBD on intractable 
paediatric epilepsies; CBD was effective in treating patients with Dravet syndrome, an epilepsy that 
does not respond to sodium channel blockers. CBD only inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 and 
endocannabinoid metabolic enzymes at supra-pharmacological concentrations.  
CBD was shown to inhibit specific binding of radioligands to several targets to more than 50% at 
concentration tested (10 µM). For most of these targets, IC 50 and Ki on binding were then evaluated. 
Of these targets, the monoamine transporters, the voltage gated sodium channels were further

evaluated as mentioned above. CBD is not a very potent CNS active compound, since plasma 
concentrations of approximately 2.7 µM should be attained, before significant effect in animal models 
and clinical studies were shown to be significantly different from vehicle/placebo groups. Hence, it 
cannot be excluded that some of the targets at which CBD was shown to inhibit radio-ligand binding at 
low micromolar concentrations might be relevant as targets for CBD in one or more indications.  
Abuse potential 
The legal status of Epidiolex under the US federal Controlled Substance Act, is currently under 
schedule V, the least restrictive schedule, defined as those with a proven medical use and low potential 
for abuse.  
CBD has activity within CNS. As a part of the early development, the interaction to known targets 
involved in drug dependence (e.g. opioid receptors, 5- HT and dopamine transporters and receptors, 
NMDA, GABA, nicotinic acetylcholine and cannabinoid receptors) were part of the performed screening 
tests in line with the GL recommendation (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/94227/2004). CBD does not interact with 
CB receptors on the clinically meaningful concentrations. There was an interaction with opioid 
receptors (Opioid μ, κ, δ), 5-HT and dopamine transporters and receptors. In functional tests, CBD 
failed to show any effect on opioid receptors (KOP, MOP) and dopamine receptor (D1). Antagonistic 
effect was observed on opioid receptor (DOP) and serotonin receptors 5HT2A and 5-HT2B in in vitro 
assay GWTX1562.  
The affinity of CBD and its active metabolites were assessed by radioligand binding studies across a 
panel of 7-transmembrane receptors, ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters. The focus was 
put on dopamine, nor-epinephrine, 5-HT, GABA, acetylcholine, opioid, glutamate and endocannabinoid 
systems. If inhibition constant (Ki) was detected below the concentration of 10 µM, the nature of the 
interaction was further examined – e.g. antagonistic or agonistic effect.  
Neither CBD nor its metabolites 7-OH-CBD or 7-COOH-CBD are were agonists or antagonists of 
cannabinoid receptors. Only antagonistic effect of CBD was observed at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, 
therefore, no adverse effects accompanying the agonists of 5-HT receptors are expected. Similarly, 
antagonist effect only was observed on δ2 opioid receptor and OX1, M3 receptors for CBD or 7--OH-
-CBD. No abuse potential is expected from these interactions. No effects were observed for 7--COOH-
-CBD in functional studies.  
As part of the Tetrad Test in NMRI mice, mice were dosed at 0, 1, 10, 50 or 100 mg/kg CBD i.p.. CBD 
showed decreased the number of rears and decreased rectal temperature of by 5 %. 6-OH-CBD 
showed no significant effects in the Tetrad test. At 50 and 100 mg/kg 7-OH-CBD showed significantly 
increased latency to remove forelimbs in the Bar Test (10.1s, P < 0.05 and 14.7 s, P < 0.001 as 
compared with vehicle controls) and it decreased the rectal temperature (-1.3 ˚C and -1.5 ˚C 
respectively, P < 0.05). The decreased rears for CBD and latency to remove forelimbs for 7-OH-CBD 
could be linked to side effects of somnolence and fatigue, as mentioned in SmPC. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
CNS 
Potential effects of CBD as CBD BDS on the central nervous system were evaluated on Locomotor 
Activity and Muscle Strength in Mice and on Locomotor Activity in Rats. In general CBD produced 
decreased locomotor activity to a slight degree and had no effect on muscle strength.  
Cardiovascular system 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 25/190 
 
The effects of CBD as CBD BDS on the cardiovascular system were investigated in in vitro studies in 
HEK-293 cells stably transfected with human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG), rabbit isolated 
cardiac Purkinje fibres, and in an in vivo cross-over study in conscious, telemetered Beagle dogs. 
In the in vitro study in HEK-293 cells, CBD was shown to inhibit hERG tail current at pharmacological 
relevant concentrations with No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) considered to be the nominal 
concentration of 150 ng/ml CBD (achieved concentration of 43 ng/ml CBD) as CBD BDS. The achieved 
concentration in the test chamber is below pharmacological relevant plasma concentrations. This 
finding was not confirmed by the study in rabbit isolated cardiac Purkinje fibres as no effects were 
observed in this study. However, due to adsorption in testing chamber, only low concentrations of CBD 
could be achieved. The data indicated a free plasma NOEL of 22 ng CBD/mL (as CBD BDS) in this test 
system, which is far below pharmacological relevant plasma concentrations. It should be noted that the 
clinical QT trial, with documented exposure above pharmacological relevance, showed a lack of effect 
of CBD-OS on cardiac conduction. Hence, no further non-clinical testing of cardiovascular endpoints are 
warranted. 
The study in four conscious beagle dogs surgically instrumented to measure blood pressure, heart rate, 
and Lead II ECG parameters showed only benign and small effects of CBD p.o. administration. Each 
dog received an oral (gavage) dose of 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg CBD as CBD BDS in a Latin square 
design with an interval of at least 6 days between doses (GWOR10111). Following administration of 
CBD BDS at dose levels of 50 and 100 mg/kg CBD, the applicant concluded that there were biologically 
significant decreases in heart rate. A statistically significant dose related decrease (P<0.01) in heart 
rate at 4 hours post dose compared with vehicle treated animals. There was also a statistically 
significant increase in systolic blood pressure (P<0.05) at 5 hours post-dose in animals dosed with 100 
mg/kg CBD BDS, along with small apparent dose related increases in systolic blood pressure, but these 
were not thought to be of biological significance. Statistical analysis also suggested dose-related 
increases in RR-interval, RH-interval, QRS and QT-interval as well as a statistically significant increase 
in RR-interval for animals dosed with 100 mg/kg CBD BDS at 4 hours post dose. However, these were 
also not thought to be of biological significance. 
Based upon this information, the NOEL was considered to be 10 mg/kg/day CBD, as CBD BDS. This is 
supported. 
Respiratory safety 
Effects on respiratory parameters after oral administration of CBD as CBD-BDS in freely moving 
conscious rats using whole body plethysmography (0, 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg) was assessed in study 
GWOR10110. CBD showed no biologically significant effects on respiratory parameters in conscious 
rats evaluated using whole body plethysmography. The NOEL was 100 mg/kg. However, the time point 
(30 min) selected for exposure determination in the respiratory safety study in rats was suboptimal. 
Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that exposure may have been at or above clinically relevant 
concentrations during the 6 hours assessment period.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The Applicant has not conducted nonclinical studies to specifically evaluate pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions with CBD. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions of CBD with concomitantly dosed AED were 
evaluated in clinical studies. This is acceptable.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The Applicant has performed a battery of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) 
studies. Only the data pertaining to CBD and CBD botanical drug substance (BDS) are presented. 
Methods of Analysis 
The Applicant claimed that the analytical methods were developed and validated for CBD, metabolites 
and relevant impurities requiring toxicological qualification. 
However, a GLP inspection by MHRA performed in July 2017 and a follow up inspection in October 2017 
has highlighted inadequacies with respect to the validation of bioanalysis methods used for several of 
the pivotal studies supporting this MAA. 
The Applicant has sponsored an ambitious effort into the bioanalysis of CBD, metabolites and related 
impurities. Five bioanalytical laboratories were involved in the task and forty bioanalytical validation 
reports were submitted. Most methods involved a multitude of analytes – up to 7 in some of the 
methods. Both GC-MS and LC-MS were used for detection and different extraction methods were also 
used.  
Due to extent of the deficiency, bioanalytical phase of affected studies was assessed in-depth to 
reconsider the scientific value of the data provided in the overall package. A Major Objection (MO) was 
raised to address the identified limitations in bioanalytical data from pivotal toxicological studies and to 
obtain a bridge with GLP compliant studies. The applicant made considerable efforts to mitigate the 
consequences.    
A new toxicokinetic study was initiated during the assessment period of the Epidyolex dossier. This 
includes a repeat of the toxicokinetic cohort of GWTX1408 (10-week juvenile toxicology study of 
Purified CBD in rat). The final study report has been submitted (GWTX18001). Furthermore, a mouse 
carcinogenicity study (GWTX1504) with CBD-OS (300 mg/kg/day) commenced in January 2018.  This 
study includes a toxicokinetic cohort wherein exposure on Day 1, Week 13 and Week 26 will be 
evaluated.  Analysis will include CBD, plus its metabolites.  Finally, a 13-week (oral gavage) repeat 
dose study (GWTX18002) commenced dosing in June 2018 and will report in Q2 2019. The applicant is 
asked to submit these studies when they are finalised. 
The CBD-metabolite 7-COOH-CBD was shown to provide human exposure 50 times higher than the 
parent compound CBD and nonclinical studies in adult animals failed to provide safety margins for this 
metabolite. The applicant argues that for some studies, the reported data for metabolites was deemed 
non-compliant due to an anticipated under-representation of exposure.  The degree of bias is 
estimated in the range of 30-50% from the actual value based on comparison of dose-response data 
with accompanied exposures across studies in the independent review. While it is agreed with the 
applicant that cross-comparison with the other studies in same species and method of administration is 
not ideal, the rough estimate of the bias could be done. For safety margin calculations, the applicant 
adjusted the exposure for 20 mg/kg dose for 24 hours based on the clinical study GWEP1544. No 
details of data adjustment are provided however it is evident that plasma concentrations correspond to 
exposures after fasted state. Considering that exposures were 4-5 times higher for AUC and Cmax, 
respectively, the provided calculations of fold safety margins are even lower.  Exposure data from 
GWTX1454 (embryo-foetal rat) study are considered valid for CBD, 6-OH-CBD, 7-COOH-CBD, THC, 11-
OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC. For CBD significant safety margins were reached and again almost no or 
small margins are reached for CBD metabolites. 
The applicant proposes to provide the updated calculation of safety margins intended as a bridge with 
GLP compliant studies along with the final study reports for the studies GWTX 1504, and 18002 via 
post-authorization measure.  This is acceptable.

Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic studies in mouse and rat were conducted by the i.p. and p.o. route of administration. 
Intravenous administration was only performed in rat. Bioavailability in rats of CBD after i.p. and p.o. 
administration was calculated based on Cmax values, i.e. AUC was not calculated for i.v. 
administration, and hence the bioavailability is most likely underestimated. Exposure in mouse after 
p.o. administration was lower than for rat, i.e. AUC and t½ was not calculable after p.o. administration 
in mouse and AUC after i.p. was comparable to AUC obtained in rat after p.o. interestingly, the 
exposure of CBD in rat was higher after p.o. administration than after i.p. administration. The 
pharmacokinetic study in minipig in 10 different formulations was helpful in developing the optimal 
formulation for the paediatric population. 
Pharmacokinetics (tmax and t½) in brain appeared to be similar to plasma for both mouse and rat, 
however brain to plasma ratio determined using AUC0-24h obtained after i.p. administration was 
higher in rat with ratios of 1868/3144 = 0.6 and 5406/1987 = 2.7 in mouse and rat, respectively.  
Distribution 
CBD was highly protein bound in rat, dog, and human plasma (> 94%), but less so in mouse and 
rabbit plasma (83% and 65%, respectively). 6-OH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD, and 7-COOH-CBD compounds 
showed high to very high binding in all species, returning values in the 98.8% to > 99.0% bound 
range. 
CBD is highly lipid soluble and distributes widely into tissues with brown fat being the tissue with 
highest concentration after the liver. After 6 and 12 hours, the ratio of 14C-CBD ng equivalents in 
brown fat to white fat is 3080/879 = 3.5, 4690/1610 = 2.9, respectively. At 24 hours the radioactivity 
in brown and white fat is similar. The concentration of CBD in skin of non-pigmented and pigmented 
rats appeared to be similar and was not accumulating between the first dose and after 3 daily doses of 
100 mg/kg. 
After 24 hours still, a significant amount of CBD was found in liver indicating a high metabolism rate 
and distribution to adipose tissue. There was no significantly higher concentration in uveal tract or skin 
of the pigmented rats, thus CBD does not bind to melanin after single dosing. At 168 hours CBD was 
still quantified in epididymis and liver. No concentration was quantified 14 days post-dose.  
Distribution to adrenal and thyroid gland as well as testis was detected. These were also the target 
organs of toxicity. In adrenals and thyroid, the effects were considered of adaptive nature and thus not 
assumed as relevant for safety concern. In liver centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy was not 
associated with significant inflammation or necrosis pathogenesis and thus the effect was also 
considered of adaptive nature. Final study report (GWTX18002) with characterization of potential risk 
due to hormonal disturbances will be provided via post-authorization measure. 
Testes were target organs for toxicity in PPND study in rats. F1 progeny small testes resulted in 
impregnation of the mated dam. This was observed at dose-related fashion. Toxicity could be 
attributed to milk exposure of F1 pups as no effects on fertility were observed in rats directly dosed 
with CBD. Cause behind the direct/indirect effect remains to be elucidated (see toxicology section).   
In consequent study (GWPP10159) with repeated dosing of 100 mg/kg p.o. of purified CBD a 
significant exposure to dorsal and abdominal skin in comparison to plasma was observed. The most 
significant accumulation occurred after repeated dosing in abdominal skin (36 825 ng/ml) where 
exposure was ~8.6 times higher than in plasma and 4 times higher than with single dosing.  It is noted 
that in the study different excipients than the ones used during clinical trials were used. As it was 
demonstrated in former studies with minipigs, absorption is formulation dependent. Plasma exposure 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 28/190 
 
corresponds to clinically relevant levels and thus accumulation of CBD in skin can be expected. In 
clinical studies rash was observed as common adverse event (SmPC).  
Metabolism 
The metabolism of CBD is very complex even after in vitro incubations, especially in hepatocytes. 
Hepatocyte incubations of CBD showed the highest extent of metabolism in human hepatocytes (93%) 
followed by dog (66%) and rat (44%) after 4 hours incubation. Several mono- and di-hydroxy 
metabolites were identified along with glucuronides of CBD and hydroxy-CBD. The major metabolite of 
CBD was CBD glucuronide in all three species, with human and dog hepatocytes also producing an acid 
metabolite of CBD (subsequently confirmed to be 7-COOH-CBD). The glucuronide of monohydroxy-
CBD was only identified in human hepatocyte incubations. The confirmed 7-OH-CBD was only present 
in rat hepatocyte incubations. 
CBD was shown to be primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 by using a standard battery of 
tests in human liver microsomes and microsomes from recombinant insect cells expressing human 
CYP450s. It was shown to be likely that CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of 6-OH-CBD and 
COOH-CBD, and CYP2C19 for the formation of 7-OH-CBD.  
UGT1A7, 1A9 and 2B7 was shown to catalyse the direct glucuronidation of CBD. 7-COOH-CBD in vitro 
showed the potential of inhibiting UGT 1A1, 1A4 and 1A6. A clinical drug-drug interaction study is 
being designed and is planned to be completed during 2020. The results will be provided post-
authorisation Furthermore the PBPK model will be refined with new UGT IC50 data for 7-COOH-CBD.   
7-OH-CBD is one of the major metabolites observed in human plasma with exposure more than half 
the exposure of CBD (GWEP1544). 7-OH-CBD could, at least to some extent, be the precursor of the 
major metabolite 7-COOH-CBD. 
CBD is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (IC50 = 1.42 µM) and 2B6, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19 with IC50s in the range 
of 2.9 to 3.2 µM. The pharmacological relevant plasma concentration is approximately 1 µM, hence 
CBD possess the potential to inhibit all these enzymes at pharmacological relevant exposure. CBD was 
also shown to be a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2 (to some extent) and of CYP3A4 (to large 
extent). These findings were followed up by performing drug-drug interaction studies of CBD with 
concomitantly administered AEDs, which are substrates of CYP3A4 and 2C19 in minipigs and human 
volunteers. 
The potential of CBD to induce major CYP450 enzymes was assessed in human hepatocytes. Following 
exposure to CBD, no marked increases in CYP1A2, 2C9 or 3A4 activity were detected at concentrations 
up to 1 µM (314 ng/mL). CYP2C19 activity was not evaluated in this study. This enzyme is highly 
inducible and CBD is a potential substrate. Applicant investigated the potential of CBD for induction of 
CYP2C19 in human hepatocytes from 3 donors using mRNA expression as the endpoint. There appears 
to be some induction of CYP2C19. Donor 1 is the only donor not showing a tendency towards induction 
of CYP2C19. It appears that several measures of mRNA in donor 1 is only recorded in duplicate, 
whereas donor 2 and donor 3 are reported with triplicate measurements. Donor 3 shows clear signs of 
concentration dependent induction of CYP2C19. At 20µM both donor 2 and donor 3 show induction at 
similar level as rifampicin (the positive control). The increases in CYP2C19 mRNA expression levels in 
human hepatocytes was seen at 20 µM CBD. This is more than 50-fold above clinical exposure and 
therefore this is not considered clinically relevant.  
Excretion 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 29/190 
 
 
 
Excretion of radioactivity after p.o. administration of 14C-labelled CBD was studied in rat and dog. 
Apparently, CBD and its potential metabolites were mainly excreted via faeces, which is expected for a 
highly lipophilic small molecule. The biliary route was not investigated separately and no metabolite 
profiling in excreta was presented. The identification of 7-COOH-CBD metabolite as a major metabolite 
in rat, dog and human and the apparent extensive glucuronidation is leading to a concern for 
potentially reactive acyl-glucuronides. However, the presence of the acyl-glucuronide of 7-COOH-CBD 
in human plasma was investigated, and although following administration of CBD-OS an acyl-
glucuronide presence of 7-COOH-CBD was observed, it is present only as a very small proportion 
(estimated <5%) of the total 7-COOH-CBD concentration.  
Elimination route in humans is in question as no mass balance study has been conducted and no other 
data were discussed (see Clinical AR).  
CBD is possibly highly excreted to milk. Due to toxicity effects on F1 progeny shown in PPND study in 
rats, CBD-OS should be contraindicated during breast-feeding. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Drug-drug interaction studies between CBD and AEDs clobazam, stiripentol and sodium valproate were 
conducted in minipig. CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are probably the enzyme responsible for clobazam N-
desmethylation and therefore highly relevant for this kind of study. Stiripentol is an inhibitor of a broad 
range of CYPs including 2C19 and 3A4 and is in itself a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 
(SPC for Diacomit). Valproic acid is a low potency inhibitor of CYP2C9. Valproate is a first line 
treatment for a broad range of seizures and a second line treatment for partial seizures and infantile 
spasms. CBD significantly increased the exposure (4.6 fold) of the major metabolite of clobazam, when 
administration of clobazam was preceded by 14 days dosing of CBD. This was also observed for 
clobazam itself; however, the effect was not significant (GWPP1439A; in minipigs, p > 0.05). The 
exposure of stiripentol was also increased when administered after 14 doses of CBD by a factor of 6.5 
measured as AUC. No statistical differences were observed when evaluating drug-drug interactions 
with valproate. The finding of drug-drug interactions of CBD with clobazam was followed up by a 
clinical study (GWEP1428) and the non-clinical observations were confirmed in humans. When 
GWP42003-P was combined with stiripentol in healthy volunteers, there was a minor increase (1.55-
fold increase in AUCtau), which was deemed unlikely to be clinically relevant (GWEP1543).  
CBD and its three major metabolites were tested for interactions with a broad range of transporters. 
The main conclusions from these studies were that CBD and 6-OH-CBD were not interacting with any 
of the tested transporters at pharmacological relevant concentrations. The in vitro transporter 
inhibition study results suggested that there is a potential for 7-COOH-CBD to interact with BCRP, 
OATP1B3 and OAT3 in vivo, however, no further in vivo study has been conducted. Since among the 
likely concomitant medicines in the indicated patient population there is no known substrate for BCRP, 
OATP1B3 or OAT3 (except valproic acid, in which clinically relevant interaction was not observed) and 
since the results of in vivo interaction studies with other drugs are not easily extrapolated to further 
drugs, the in vivo interaction study is not deemed necessary. The Applicant´s justification that the 
clinically important interactions appear low is accepted. The SmPC contains satisfactory information 
about in vitro observations. 
The risk of CBD interaction with P-gp was assessed by a calculated Ki. The estimated CBD Ki is lower 
than the calculated concentration, which indicates that in vivo CBD inhibition of intestinal P-gp-
mediated efflux cannot be excluded. The applicant discussed that this result could be overestimated 
due to CBD solubility and stability limits in the assay matrix for study GWOR1251. However, it is 
impossible to accurately evaluate the impact of observed limits on the results and their clinical 
relevance. The final formulation of CBD-OS contains the excipients that provide enhanced solubility. 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 30/190 
 
Due to the fact that the in vivo inhibition of intestinally expressed P-gp by CBD cannot be excluded, 
this information has been reflected in the SmPC. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
An extensive toxicology package in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys and juvenile rats and juvenile 
dogs with CBD-OS and/or purified CBD and/or CBD as BDS was provided. Yet, only factual description 
of study results with a brief discussion of toxicity findings was provided. Most of the studies included 
also toxicokinetic analysis of all major metabolites identified in human and these data were also 
neglected in discussions.  
Except for three repeat-dose toxicity studies with CBD as BDS and carcinogenicity study in rats (with 
insufficient exposure to CBD via diet), all pivotal in vivo studies including all juvenile toxicity studies in 
rats and dogs, self-administration study in rats are considered as non-GLP compliant based on recent 
inspection conducted by MHRA. Major deficiencies were found on the bioanalytical phase of the studies 
but toxicology data are not affected.  Reliability of the toxicokinetic results is questioned mostly on 
metabolites for CBD.  
Moreover, for CBD, safety margins calculations of NOAELs from pivotal toxicology studies were 
compared to much lower plasma exposures than were quantified in clinical studies with corresponding 
posology (multiple dose, fed study).  
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies for CBD-OS, Purified CBD, or CBD as CBD BDS were conducted by the 
Applicant. CBD has low acute i.v. toxicity with lethal dose for 50% of the exposed population values of 
50, 242, > 254, or 212 mg/kg in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys, respectively. 
This is considered acceptable as these studies have limited value in this context and literature studies 
are available. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity profile of CBD-OS, formulated in ethanol, sucralose, strawberry flavouring, and sesame oil 
(clinical  formulation),  was  evaluated  in  GLP-compliant  repeated  dose  general toxicity  studies in  mice, 
rats, and dogs via oral administration. Studies were conducted for up to 13, 26, or 39 weeks for each 
species, respectively. Furthermore, rats and dogs were dosed for up to 28 days via i.v. administration.  
It  should  be  noted,  that  for  all  these  pivotal  toxicity  studies,  no  GLP  compliance  was  claimed  for 
bioanalysis and this also includes the toxicokinetics phase. In order to be able to provide a meaningful 
assessment  of  the  general  toxicity  studies  submitted  to  date,  the  exposure  of  parent  drug  CBD  was 
used,  but  exposure  to  all  other  analytes  (metabolites  and  potential  impurities)  were  not  taken  into 
account  in  this  assessment,  see  above  comment.  The  studies  submitted  currently  can  be  viewed  as 
supportive,  and  exposure  measurements  can  be  utilised,  if  the  results  from  the  new  planned  studies 
are  within  the  same  ranges.  Furthermore,  a  number  of  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with 
CBD BDS was also submitted along with a carcinogenicity study. These will only be briefly mentioned 
under  section  carcinogenicity,  due  to  the  difficulty  in  dissecting  out  effects  of  CBD  with  concomitant 
administration  of  other  cannabinoids  etc.  THC  was  typically  present  and  could  therefore  have  elicited 
effects, when dosed at such high doses as used in toxicity studies (up to 225 mg/kg/day).

Mouse study GWTX1503, 13week oral toxicity 
In mice, the target organs of toxicity in the 13-week study were the liver and the kidneys.  
The  key  findings  in  this  study  were  indicative  of  changes  in  the  liver.  Mean  alanine  amino 
transaminase/alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  levels  were  higher  than  controls  during  Week  7  and  13 
in  males  given  ≥  150  mg/kg/day  (by  approximately  65%  and 40%,  respectively)  and  during  Week  7 
for  females  given  150  or  300  mg/kg/day  (by  259%  or  83%,  respectively).  Microscopic  centrilobular 
hepatocyte  hypertrophy  in  all  animals  given  300  mg/kg/day  and  in  some  animals  given  100  or  150 
mg/kg/day was associated with increased liver weight in all groups and macroscopic enlargement at ≥ 
150 mg/kg/day.

In  conclusion,  the  no  observed  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL)  was  300  mg/kg/day  CBD-OS, 
corresponding  to  the  respective  Week  13  maximum  measured  plasma  concentration  (Cmax)  and  area 
under the concentration-time curve calculated to the last observable concentration at time t (AUC(0-t)) 
values of 9810 ng/mL and 44300 ng h/mL in males and 5770 ng/mL and 46400 ng∙h/mL in females. 
Several  signs  of  liver  toxicity  were  observed  (increased  ALT/AST,  dose-dependent  increased  liver 
weight  in  all groups  correlated  with  both  macroscopic  (mottled)  and  microscopic  findings  (hepatocyte 
hypertrophy)  in  higher  dose-groups.  At  the  low  dose  only  minimal  findings  were  observed,  however 
increased liver weight was significant (p = 0.01). It should also be noted, in this context, that not all 
animals  in  the  mid  and  low  dose  were  subjected  to  microscopic  evaluation  and  findings  of  mottled 
livers were present in mid dose. Based on macroscopic and microscopic evaluation, no adverse effects 
were deemed present as the impact on livers were ascribed to a reaction to large doses of a xenobiotic 
and  not  to  an  effect  of  CBD  per  se.  Applicant  has  adequately  explained  the  missing  histopathological 
evaluation  of  livers  in  mid  and  low  dose  in  this  study.  However,  incidence  of  liver  impact  in  patients 
treated with CBD is high and measures have been taken to follow up on a group of patients to assess 
the  potential  for  chronic  liver  injury  for  up  to  5  years  as  part  of  post  approval  requirements  for  the 
FDA. This is adequate. 
Rat GWTX1412, 26-week oral toxicity study with 4-week recovery 
In rats, the target organs for toxicities were liver, thyroid, and adrenals presented by change in organ 
weight. 
Microscopically  these  were  specified  by  liver  centrilobular  hypertrophy  and  thyroid  follicular  cell 
hypertrophy in both sexes along with increased adrenocortical vacuolation in males and minor ovarian 
interstitial  cell  hyperplasia  in  females.  In  liver,  an  organ  enlargement  was  also  associated  with 
increased  mean  plasma  ALT  and  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP)  activities  at  the  highest  dose  tested. 
Effects  in  liver  and  thyroid  were  considered by  Expert  as  non-adverse  and  representative  of  adaptive 
changes due to microsomal hepatic induction. 
The  applicant  summarise  the  liver  findings  as  follows:  The  centrilobular  hypertrophy  in  the  liver  of 
animals  given  ≥  50  mg/kg/day,  the  main  finding  in  this  study,  was  associated  with  increased  liver 
weight,  macroscopic  enlargement,  and,  in  animals  given  150  mg/kg/day,  increases  in  ALP  and  ALT 
activities.  Thyroid  follicular  hypertrophy  in  both  sexes,  correlated  with  increased  thyroid  weights  and 
macroscopic enlargement in males, was considered an indirect effect of treatment due to its recognized 
relationship with liver hypertrophy.

Levels  of  thyroid  hormones,  luteinizing  hormone  (LH)  follicle  stimulating  hormone  (FSH)  and/or 
prolactin  were  not  examined  in  the  rodent  studies  and  thus  mode  of  action  of  the  findings  and  their 
relevance  to  humans  are  not  clear.  The  underlying  cause  of  the  adrenal  gland  toxicity  was  only 
commented  by  fact  that  adrenocortical  vacuolation  is  also  a  recognized  common  phenomenon  which 
occurs  under  a  variety  of  conditions  including  the  administration  of  a  xenobiotic.    However,  these 
effects  are  also  known  for  studies  with  drugs  especially  those  that  interfere  with  normal 
steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex and/or perturb the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hormonal axis.  
Some  further  effects  of  hormonal  dysregulation  were  observed  across  the  studies  with  cannabidiol or 
impurities (structurally very similar to CBD) such as small testes with unsuccessful impregnation of the 
dam (PPND study in rats at the high dose), interstitial cell hyperplasia of ovary in rats (26-week study 
in  rats  with  CBD-OS),  or  an  increased  incidence  of  the  dioestrus/metoestrus  phases  of  cycle.    In 
addition,  triiodothyronine  (T3),  T4  and  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  (TSH)  endpoints  in  this  repeat 
dose  study,  was  provided  as  draft  results  to  address  the  underlying  effects  causing  discrepancies  in 
hormonal  pathways.  Dose-dependent  decrease  in  T4  and  increase  in  TSH  has  been  noted  mostly in 
male rats and in individual female rats. In general, rodents are more sensitive than humans to thyroid 
perturbation  effects.  It  is  however  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  monitoring  for  potential  hormonal 
disturbance  via  clinical  and  pharmacovigilance  activities  should  be  initiated,  if  the  final  non-clinical 
and/or available clinical data demonstrates a cause for concern regarding endocrine parameters. Final 
study  report  (GWTX18002)  with  characterization  of  potential  risk  due  to  hormonal  disturbances  is 
awaited via post-authorization measure commitment. 
Toxicity  effects  were  observed  in  lungs  with  dose-related  increase  in  incidence  and  severity  of 
pulmonary foamy macrophages observed across studies in rat with cannabidiol.  These of findings are 
deemed  toxicologically  insignificant  and  not  relevant  to  humans.  No  associations  to  other  pulmonary 
adverse effects in non-clinical or clinical studies have been detected.  
39-Week Oral (Gavage) Toxicity with 4-Week Recovery in Dogs (GWTX1413) 
Beagle dogs (4/sex/main groups) received CBD-OS at 0 (vehicle), 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day once daily 
for 39 weeks. Reversibility of changes was evaluated following a 4-week recovery phase (2/sex/control 
and high dose groups). 
In dogs, the target organ for toxicity was liver with hepatocyte hypertrophy, macroscopic enlargement 
and  increased  liver  weight.  No  increase  in  bilirubin,  necrosis  or  significant  inflammation  and/or 
proliferation suggests that effects observed in rats and dogs might be reflections of adaptive changes 
due  to  microsomal  hepatic  induction.  However,  due  to  absence  of  hormonal  examinations  and  some 
other  effects  of  hormonal  misbalance  observed  in  the  studies  these  effects  need  to  be  further 
substantiated via post-authorisation measure.

The  genotoxic  potential  of  CBD  has  been  evaluated  in  a  standard  test  battery  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
assays according to ICH S2(R1). All tests concluded CBD to be negative for genotoxic potential.  
A genotoxicity assessment of 7-COOH-CBD using non-GLP test material in an Ames Test (GWTX18016) 
was  provided.  Results  from  this  study  showed  that  7-COOH-CBD  did  not  induce  mutation  in 
5 Salmonella  typhimurium  strains  (TA98,  TA100,  TA102,  TA1535  and  TA1537)  under  the  conditions 
selected  for  this  study.    However,  test  item  output  from  the  scaled-up  manufacture  will  produce 
appropriately characterised material to conduct genotoxicity GLP studies planned with both 7-OH-CBD 
and 7-COOH-CBD.  GLP genotoxicity studies are awaited via post-authorization measure commitment. 
Carcinogenicity 
A  104  weeks  carcinogenicity  study  was  conducted  in  rats  with  CBD  as  CBD  BDS  by  the  oral  dietary 
route of administration at doses 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day. Overall, no concerns of tumour findings were 
found.  Interestingly,  at  50  mg/kg/day  CBD  there  was  a  reduced  incidence  of  tumours  generally 
associated with hormonally-mediated neoplasia in aging animals. The clinical relevance of this finding 
is uncertain. 
Exposure  was  adequate  to  provide  safety  margin  to  clinical  exposure  at  the  high  dose,  see  Figure  3. 
However,  was  very  low  in  comparison  to  clinically  achievable  exposures  and  standard  safety  margins 
for carcinogenicity studies. 
What  is  remarkable  for  this  study  is  the  increase  in  exposure  of  CBD  over  time.  This  trend  was  also 
observed in the 26 weeks repeat dose toxicity study in rat, especially from week 20 to 26.

Some  overlap  with  the  liver  findings  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  were  observed,  e.g.  dose-
related  agonal  vacuolation  and  centrilobular  vacuolation.  The  low  dose  in  this  study  (5  mg/kg/day) 
seem to be devoid of any significant findings in liver.  
The carcinogenic potential of CBD has been adequately evaluated to be negative and the liver findings 
of the repeat dose toxicity studies was confirmed at lower doses in rat at life-time exposure.  
In  mice,  carcinogenicity  study  (GWTX1504)  with  CBD-OS  (300  mg/kg/day)  commenced  in  January 
2018.    This  study  includes  a  toxicokinetic  cohort  wherein  exposure  on  Day  1, Week  13  and  Week  26 
will be evaluated.  Analysis will include CBD, plus its metabolites. Results of the study will be provided 
post-authorisation and reflected in SmPC as relevant.

In  a  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  toxicity  study,  Han  Wistar  rats  (20/sex/group)  were 
given  0,  75,  150,  or  250  mg/kg/day  for  2  weeks  prior  to  pairing  until  the  day  prior  to  necropsy  for 
males  and  up  to  gestation  day  (GD)  6  for  females  (GWTX1456).  There  were  no  treatment-related 
deaths and no adverse clinical or post-dosing observations. During the post-pairing phase, there was a 
treatment-related  reduction  in  the  overall  body  weight  gain  of  males  given  ≥  150  mg/kg/day.  There 
were  no  treatment-related  necropsy  observations  in  either  sex  and  no  test  article-related  effects  on 
male  or  female  reproductive  indices,  male  reproductive  organ  weights,  female  estrus  cycling,  or  any 
caesarean-section  parameters  at  doses  up  to  250  mg/kg/day  Purified  CBD,  which  was  determined  to 
be the NOAEL. Evaluation  of CBD effects on male and female reproductive performance is considered 
adequate and it is agreed that no significant negative effects were observed in rat. A Safety margin of 
60 fold were calculated for inclusion in the SmPC section 5.3 based on exposure measurements from 
the rat embryofetal study (GWTX1454) at 250 mg/kg/day dose level on Day GD17.  Adjusted human 
AUC (0-24h) 2790 ng∙h/ml was used for calculation. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Embryo-foetal  development  was  evaluated  in  rat  and  rabbit.  Rabbit  seemed  to  be  more  sensitive  to 
effects  of  CBD  compared  to  rat.  This  was  evident  by  the  observed  dose-dependent  body  weight  loss 
compared to controls in rabbit. Embryo-foetal development in rat was insensitive to high CBD exposure 
(Cmax  up  to  12800  ng/ml).  The  NOAEL  for  maternal  toxicity  was  amended  to  150mg/kg/day  due  to 
100% loss of pregnancy in 2 dams at the high dose of 250 mg/kg/day. NOAEL for effects on embryo-
foetal  development  in  rabbit  was  80  mg/kg/day.  Foetal  variations  observed  at  125  mg/kg/day  CBD 
(e.g., unossified metacarpal, bulging eyes, and nonerupted incisors) were considered to be secondary 
to the reduced foetal weights. Maternal exposure at 80 mg/kg/day Purified CBD corresponded to GD 19 
Cmax  and  AUC(0-t)  values  of  220  ng/mL  and  2030  ng∙h/ml,  respectively.  Cmax  of  this  dose  was  lower 
than  pharmacological  relevant  exposure  in  children  and  adults  (approximately  290  ng/ml  and  320 
ng/ml,  respectively).  However,  protein  binding  is  lower  in  rabbit  compared  to  rats  and  humans  with 
65%  bound  in  rabbit  and  95%  and  94%  in  rat  and  humans,  respectively.  The  non-existing  safety 
margins for the rabbit study are reflected in SmPC section 5.3. and the rat NOAEL of 150 mg/kg/day is 
reflected to result in a safety margin of 50 fold. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function  
The  effects  of  CBD  on  pre-  and  postnatal  development  including  maternal  function  were  evaluated  in 
rat. There were no Purified CBD- related clinical or post dosing observations for the maternal animals 
(F0).  Endpoints  in  F1  generation  included  body  weight,  developmental  landmarks  including  sexual 
development,  learning  and  memory,  fertility  and  macroscopic  examination  at  necropsy.  NOAEL  was 
lower  for  F1  generation  (75  mg/kg/day)  than  for  the  parental  generation  (250  mg/kg/day)  due  to 
small  testes  in  males  and  reduced  fertility  index  in  females  of  F1  generation.  Dosing  of  the  maternal 
animals  at  MD  and  HD  in PPND  study  in  rats  (GWTX1532)  had  a  direct effect  on  progeny  exposed to 
the  drug  via  placenta  prenatally  or  postnatally  via  milk.  In  F1  generation  physical,  sexual  and 
developmental  delay  with  effects  on  neurobehavioral  functions  (pupillary  response)  were  observed. 
Cannabidiol is a lipophilic compound with long elimination half-life and thus is expected to be excreted 
significantly to milk. No data on CBD analysis in milk was provided. However, published data on CBD 
and  Sativex  indicate  very  high  milk  to  plasma  ratio.  Breast-feeding  is  not  recommended  during 
treatment  and  due  to  severity  of  the  proposed  indications  discontinuation  of  the  therapy  during 
lactation  is  out  of  question.  Thus,  breast-feeding  should  be  discontinued  during  treatment.  A  Safety 
margin  of  9  was  calculated  for  this  study,  based  on  exposure  data  from  Study  GWTX1454,  at  75 
mg/kg/day,  on  GD6.    Adjusted  human  AUC(0-24h)  2790  ng∙h/ml  was  used  for  calculation  of the  safety 
margin.

Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated  
The  Applicant  sponsored  three  pivotal  neonatal  and  juvenile  toxicity  studies.  One  study  in  rat  with 
s.c./p.o.  administration,  one  study  in  rat  with  s.c./i.v  administration  and  one  study  in  dog  with  i.v. 
administration. It should be noted, that this MAA does not include an intravenous formulation. In the 
10-week main neonatal/juvenile toxicity study with  6 weeks recovery, Han Wistar rats were given an 
s.c. dose of 0 or 15 mg/kg/day Purified CBD on PND 4 to 6 followed by p.o. (gavage) doses of 0, 100, 
150,  or  250  mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  from  PND  7  to  77 (GWTX1408).  CBD  effects  on  fertility  (i.e.,  sexual 
maturity),  behavioural  endpoints,  Dual-energy  X-ray  absorptiometry,  macroscopic  and  microscopic 
evaluation were assessed.  
In juvenile rats, no new organs for toxicity were identified in comparison to adult rats. No neurological 
effects (Morris water maze, motor activity, learning and memory and auditory startle assays) or effect 
on long bone (femur) growth were recorded. Isolated increase of bone mineral density in males of high 
dose  group  was  reversible  during  recovery.  Increase  of  biochemistry  parameters  such  as  cholesterol, 
calcium and protein did not result in toxicity findings.  Underlying cause is therefore unknown. Safety 
margins  and  exposures  for  metabolites  are  being  re-examined,  as  the  bioanalysis  method  first  used 
was not GLP compliant and has been shown to overestimate the exposure of the metabolites compared 
to  reanalysis  performed  and  submitted  in  an  interim  report.  The  NOAEL  (15/250)  was  amended  to 
15/150 mg/kg/day since there were three inconclusive pup deaths at this dose level. 
Two studies were conducted using the intravenous route of administration. Exposure obtained in these 
studies  was  lower  based  on  AUC  compared  to  the  study  using  the  oral  route  of  administration.  It  is 
anticipated  that  most  findings  are  effects  of  continuous  exposure  to  CBD  and  not  pharmacokinetic 
peaks  of  very  high  plasma  concentrations.  Using  the  dog  as  an  illustrative  example,  Cmax  was  higher 
than AUC0-t, indicating a very fast half-life in juvenile dogs after i.v. administration, see figure below. 
Cmax  and  AUC(0-t)  values  of  27700  ng/ml  and  25600  ng∙h/ml  in  males  and  27900  ng/ml  and  24700 
ng∙h/ml in females.

Toxicokinetic data 
PK profiles in juvenile dog (GWTX1556) 
In  juvenile  dogs,  no  adverse  effect  upon  body  weight,  growth  measurements,  physical  development 
(development of testes descent and vaginal opening) or extended assessments such as ophthalmology 
(indirect  ophthalmoscopy  and  biomicroscopic  (slit  lamp)  examinations),  neurological  examination 
(general attitude and behaviour, spinal and cranial nerves, postural reactions /qualitative observational 
battery  or  ECG  (HR  and/or  RR  interval,  PR  and  QT  intervals,  calculation  of  the  QTc  (using  Van  de 
Water’s formula) as well as QRS complex duration) were seen up to highest dose tested. Dose-related 
effects which were not considered by study director as relevant included transient effect of decreased 
activity in some males at high dose and statistically significant but transient decrease in length growth. 
Effect of bone growth was compensated at the end of the study. Bone density was not measured. Liver 
enzyme levels or plasma calcium levels were not affected.  
The  rat  study  (GWTX1524)  employed  much  lower  doses  than  the  oral  study  and  obtained  lower 
exposure as well: Cmax and AUC(0-t) values of 1310 ng/mL and 5980 ng∙h/ml in males and 2160 ng/ml 
and  10800  ng∙h/ml  in  females.  In  this  study,  no  organ  weight  changes,  macroscopic  or  microscopic 
findings considered to be related to treatment with CBD was found. This is reassuring, since exposure 
was determined to be higher than Cmax in children of 290 ng/ml.  
Local Tolerance  
No  stand-alone  local  tolerance  studies  were  performed.  This  is  acceptable  as  the  route  of 
administration is p.o. and this route has been used in most of the pivotal toxicity studies. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
No  stand-alone  antigenicity  studies  were  performed.  This  is  acceptable  as  antigenicity  may  be 
observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies if arising. 
Immunotoxicity 
No stand-alone immunotoxicity studies were performed. This is acceptable as CBD is not suspected to 
immuno-toxic and signs of potential immunotoxicity may be observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Dependence 
Based  on  preclinical  and  clinical  studies,  purified  CBD  appears  to  have  low  abuse  potential,  therefore 
Epidiolex  is  currently  a  Schedule  V  substance  in  the  USA  (DEA,  Schedules  of  Controlled  Substances: 
Placement in Schedule V of Certain FDA-Approved Drugs Containing Cannabidiol, 83 Fed. Reg. 48950 
Sept.  28,  2018).  Abuse  potential  studies  were  performed  with  CBD-OS  (or  an  appropriate  i.v. 
formulation  for  i.v.  self-administration  studies)  in  accordance  with  contemporaneous  FDA  and  EU 
guidelines. In vitro studies pertaining to abuse potential of CBD were also conducted as was an in vivo 
Tetrad test in the mouse.  
The  abuse  potential  of  CBD-OS  and/or  Purified  CBD  was  investigated  in  models  of  abuse  potential 
using:  
• Drug Discrimination Procedure to evaluate CBD against THC and Midazolam.  
• Non-precipitated Withdrawal Procedure compared to diazepam and morphine.  
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 40/190 
 
•  Self-Administration  Procedure  in  the  heroin  and  cocaine  trained  rat  and  midazolam-trained  rhesus 
macaque.  
In  non-clinical  models  of  abuse,  only  minor,  signals  predictive  of  abuse  potential  were  observed  with 
CBD  at  doses  producing  systemic  exposures  equal  to,  or  in  excess  of,  those  measured  following 
therapeutic doing in man.  
Rats trained to THC dosed with CBD showed partial, non dose-dependent generalization to THC at 75 
and 150 mg/kg. Rats trained to midazolam generalised CBD-OS to saline cue at all doses.  
Evaluation of CBD in the non-precipitated withdrawal test in the juvenile and adult rats showed some 
withdrawal  effects.  There  are  apparent  differences  in  sensitivity  to  withdrawal  effects  after  morphine 
treatment  between  male  and  female  rats,  with  males  showing  withdrawal  symptoms  of  increased 
severity.  Female  rats  still  show  withdrawal  symptoms  similar  to  that  described  in  the  literature.  It  is 
agreed that behavioural withdrawal effects of positive controls diazepam and morphine were reported 
for  male  adult  and  juvenile  rat  (GWTX1555).  The  vehicle  group  did  show  few  and  mild  symptoms  of 
withdrawal  similar  to  the  low  dose  group  treated  with  CBD-OS  (slight  increase  in  body  temperature 
and increase in food consumption). The high dose group showed slight decrease in temperature upon 
withdrawal  of  CBD  similar  to  an  effect  observed  after  withdrawal  of  morphine  and  diazepam.  Upon 
withdrawal  of  diazepam  and  morphine,  a  decrease  in  food  consumption  was  observed.  This  was  not 
seen with CBD-OS or vehicle. Hence, if the effects observed are due to withdrawal of CBD/ethanol, the 
effects are mild. 
Female juvenile rats seemed to be the most sensitive to withdrawal effects while toxicity effect (body 
weight loss) to CBD treatment was pronounced in adult rats.  
No  positive  reinforcement  was  observed  with  CBD  in  midazolam-trained  rhesus  macaque  up  to  5.6 
mg/kg/infusion (GWTX1664). 
In  cocaine-trained  rats  up  to  1.5  mg/kg/infusion  (GWTX1551),  no  reinforcing  effects  were  observed, 
however  in  the  heroin-trained  rat  (GWTX1663),  a  non-dose  dependent  weak  positive  reinforcement 
was observed (at only the intermediate dose (0.1 mg/kg/infusion), which was significantly lower than 
positive reinforcement observed with heroin.  
At high doses the same or higher than therapeutic exposures were reached.  
Excipients 
The single dose with amount of ethanol 7.9 mg/kg (at doses of 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS) exceeds the 
limit (6 mg/kg) which corresponds also to marginally crossed limit (0.01g/l) for BAC as well in 2-6 
years old children up to 20 kg. Moreover, the drug product will be used in epileptics, a group of 
patients very sensitive to alcohol adverse effects. This is acceptable and adequately reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Studies on impurities 
The  applicant  has  submitted  adequate  information  to  document  that  the  four  impurities  of  CBD  drug 
product  identified  to  above  qualification  limits  according  to  ICHQ3  A/B  (R2)  are  not  likely  to  impose 
further risk to the patients than CBD alone. The four impurities did not show potential for genotoxicity.  
The applicant conducted studies to define pharmacological activity of impurities. A panel of 70 targets 
comprising of 7-TM receptors, ion channels, transporters and enzymes was used in radioligand binding 
study  (GWPP17035).  Furthermore,  functional  activity  study  for  COX1  and  COX2  enzymes  was 
examined. No concentration dependence was observed in range of tested conditions 10nM, 100 nM up 
to  1  µM.  At  concentration  of  10  µM  several  molecular  targets  were  engaged.  This  is,  however, 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 41/190 
 
appreciable  above  the  clinical  plasma  concentrations  potentially  reached  based  on  proposed 
specifications for impurities.  
As mentioned above, all impurities above qualification level are considered as toxicologically qualified. 
Pharmacological  profile  of  one  impurity  was  evaluated  in  pharmacological  studies  and  described  in 
scientific  literature.  This  impurity  can  engage  with  a  range  of  molecular  targets  at  micro-molar 
concentrations.  The  content  of  CBDV  is  up  to  1.0  %  (w/w)  in  the  to-be-marketed  formulation.  No 
involvement of targets studied is expected. The content of Δ9-THC is up to 0.10% (w/w) in the to-be 
marketed product. 
24 month supportive stability data demonstrated that there has been no significant change in levels of 
these compounds over the period tested for the long term and accelerated stability. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant argues that Phase II Environmental Risk Assessment is not necessary for CBD, since it is 
present in the environment already due to the increasing production of hemp for purposes other than 
in the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, the applicant rightly calculated a refined Fpen to be used 
for determination of PECsurfacewater for CBD in EU to be 0.15 μg/l, and has sponsored a toxicity pilot 
screen in zebrafish as summarised below. 
An in vitro toxicity pilot screen (GWP002) of Purified CBD was performed in zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 
determine acute toxicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and embryotoxicity at doses ranging from 0.01 
μM to 500 μM.  
Purified CBD produced acute toxicity at body burdens > 1.8 ng/larva. Hepatotoxicity occurred at a high 
body burden of 116.1 ng/larva and cardiotoxicity, characterized by bradycardia, occurred from 50 μM 
(15700 ng/ml). In the embryotoxicity screen, all Purified CBD doses up to 1 μM (314 ng/ml = 314 
μg/l) were considered nontoxic was the no observed effect concentration [NOEC]). The lowest 
observed effect concentration (LOEC) was 5 μM (1570 ng/ml). 
This study may predict that no risk for aquatic organism is present as PECsurfacewater for CBD in EU is 
0.15 µg/l. 
Log Kow was determined to be >5. This triggers that CBD should be screened in a stepwise procedure, 
for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity according to EU Technical Guidance Document. 
However since; 
1) CBD is already present in the environment as a natural substance in considerable amounts,  
2) has shown a low potential for toxicity in a zebrafish pilot assay (high NOEL of 314 µg/l when 
PECsurfacewater for CBD in EU being 0.15 µg/l) and  
3) is highly metabolised in humans,  
the environmental risk of CBD is considered low and no further studies are required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In general CBD showed anticonvulsant effect in several relevant animal seizure models.  
A considerable effort was put into the elucidation of the CBD mechanism of action. The proposed 
targets are as an antagonist on the GPR55 receptor, a TRPV1 agonist inducing desensitization and a 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 42/190 
 
reuptake inhibitor of adenosine. These targets seem to be showing activity in relevant concentrations. 
A number of other CNS targets were also investigated as part of the off target screening.  
With regard to secondary pharmacology, a great effort was performed to characterise CBD and 
selected impurities and metabolites.  
Safety pharmacology was evaluated in separate studies in rat and dog. The rat studies (CNS and 
respiratory) were negative, however were not supported with adequate exposure. Cardiovascular 
safety was evaluated in vitro in sub-pharmacological relevant concentrations. The GLP in vivo study 
performed in dogs demonstrated a decreased in heart rate (≥ 50 mg/kg, biologically relevant), 
increased systolic blood pressure (≥100 mg/kg), and increased R-R (statistically significant), R-H, QRS, 
and QT intervals (at 100 mg/kg). In lower doses, dose-related increases occurred which was however 
considered as not biologically relevant. The NOEL was found to be 10 mg/kg CBD as CBD BDS. The 
changes observed following dosing at 50 or 100 mg CBD/kg/day were considered not adverse but 
related to the pharmacodynamic activity of CBD by the study director.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant sponsored an overly complicated and ambitious bioanalytical program. A GLP inspection 
performed by MHRA, revealed several concerns of flawed bioanalytical reliability. Considerable efforts 
were made to mitigate the consequences of GLP-deficient bioanalysis in the majority of pivotal toxicity 
studies, which overall is considered adequate.  
Single dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in rodents; however, the study evaluating the i.v. 
route of administration presented no pharmacokinetic calculations. Pharmacokinetics (tmax and t½) in 
brain appeared to be similar to plasma for both mouse and rat, however brain to plasma ratio 
determined using AUC0-24h obtained after i.p. administration was higher in rat with ratios of 0.6 and 
2.7 in mouse and rat, respectively. This may explain the lower sensitivity of mice compared to rats in 
the pharmacological rodent models. A pharmacokinetic study in minipig in 10 different formulations 
was helpful in developing the optimal formulation for the paediatric population. 
The metabolism of CBD is very complex and was investigated in hepatocytes, microsomes and plasma 
of dosed animals and human volunteers. Metabolites in excreta were not investigated. 
The potential of CBD to inhibit and/or induce CYP450 and UGTs was investigated in a series of studies.  
CBD is a substrate, a time dependent inhibitor (potential irreversible) and a potential inducer of 
CYP3A4. CBD is also a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP2C19, which is polymorphic and can also be 
induced. The data generated in these studies indicate that CBD and 7-COOH-CBD are likely to induce 
CYP450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations via PXR, CAR and AhR.  Therefore, it can be 
assumed that CYP450 induction is a contributing factor to the enlarged livers observed in the rats in 
studies conducted. Drug interaction studies with concomitant treated antiepileptic drugs were 
conducted in minipigs and again in humans.  
Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of CBD-OS, formulated in ethanol, sucralose, strawberry flavouring, and sesame oil 
(clinical formulation), was evaluated in GLP-compliant repeated dose general toxicity studies in mice, 
rats, and dogs via oral administration. Studies were conducted for up to 13, 26, or 39 weeks for each 
species, respectively. Consistently, CBD induced liver toxicity, which was dose dependent. The 
applicant considered all findings in toxicity studies as non-adverse, as there was an absence of 
inflammation and necrosis, and a tendency for reversal was observed after end of treatment, therefore 
the highest dose levels were consistently selected as NOAEL.  Levels of thyroid hormones, luteinizing 
hormone (LH) follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or prolactin were not examined in the studies 
and thus mode of action and its relevance to humans is not clear. Some further effects of hormonal 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 43/190 
 
dysregulation (e.g., small testes, interstitial cell hyperplasia of ovary, increased incidence of the 
dioestrus/metoestrus phases of cycle etc.) were observed across the studies with cannabidiol or 
impurities (a structurally very similar to CBD). It is expected that comprehensive table with safety 
margins updates showing original and new value will be provided along with final reports post-
authorisation. Monitoring for potential hormonal disturbance via clinical and pharmacovigilance 
activities should be initiated and the final study report (GWTX18002) with characterization of potential 
risk due to hormonal disturbances should be submitted as a post-authorization measure. 
CBD showed no genotoxic potential. Genotoxic potential for active metabolite 7-OH-CBD or abundant 
human metabolite 7-COOH-CBD is currently under investigation and should be submitted as a post-
authorization measure. 
A carcinogenicity study in mice revealed some overlap with the liver findings in the repeat dose toxicity 
studies, e.g. dose-related agonal vacuolation and centrilobular vacuolation. The low dose in this study 
(5 mg/kg/day) seems to be devoid of any significant findings in liver. No increases in tumour findings 
were identified. 
The applicant sponsored a battery of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. Rats (F0) were 
insensitive to reproductive toxicity. However, the F1 generation was more sensitive than the parental 
generation due to small testes in males and reduced fertility index in females. The rabbit did show 
adverse effects in an embryo-foetal development study at plasma concentrations in the same range as 
relevant in patients. However, protein binding is lower in rabbit compared to rats and humans with 
65% bound in rabbit and 95% and 94% in rat and humans, respectively. Hence, if protein binding is 
taken into account, adequate safety margins to human plasma concentrations would be anticipated for 
the rabbit findings.  
Effects of CBD in juvenile animals were evaluated in rat and dog. The liver findings observed in adult 
animals were confirmed in juvenile rats as well. Statistically significant occurrence of variations of a 
supernumerary liver lobe in foetuses was above historical control data. The applicant, however, failed 
to provide discussion on human relevancy of the observed effect. It is claimed that human data on 
supernumerary liver is limited and that possible causes can be drug or congenitally related. Potential 
for occurrence under maternal treatment with CBD during pregnancy thus cannot be excluded. It is 
however acknowledged that CBD-OS should not be used during the pregnancy. Furthermore, in view of 
severity of the indications, the concern is not further pursued.   
The applicant sponsored studies to determine the rewarding properties, the similarity of physiological 
effect compared to known drugs of abuse, and potential for dependence/withdrawal of CBD. While 
marginal signals were observed in some studies, CBD does not possess rewarding properties, is not 
similar in affect to THC and midazolam and dose not induce a withdrawal syndrome. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
A national GLP inspection (MHRA) has questioned the validity and reliability of the bioanalytical data in 
the preclinical studies. As similar analytical methods were used throughout the clinical pharmacology 
studies, the results of these studies were questioned. An EMA GCP inspection was triggered concerning 
6 clinical studies.  
Consequently, a request for GCP inspection has been adopted for the following clinical studies: 
GWEP1544, GWEP1428, GWEP1543, GWEP1332, GWEP1423, GWEP1414. At the inspection of the 
analytical laboratory, 6 major and 8 minor findings were observed. After evaluation of the response 
two of these findings were upgraded to critical. Four Major and 2 Critical findings were reported in the 
final GCP report, which were of concern. However, based on the GCP report and the responses from 
the applicant, the PK/PD data included in MA Application are overall considered valid. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 15 clinical pharmacology and patient trials with a PK component were completed as part of 
the CBD-OS clinical development program. The application includes 10 completed trials in healthy 
subjects (GWEP1544, GWEP1431, GWEP1541, GWEP1543, GWEP17028, GWEP17075, GWEP17077, 
and GWEP1446 [trials with a PK element], and the 2 supporting trials, looking at the effects of CBD-OS 
on sleep [GWEP1448] and withdrawal symptoms [GWEP1542]), 2 trials in specific populations (renal-
impaired [GWEP1540], hepatic-impaired [GWEP1539]), and 5 trials in patients with epilepsy (efficacy: 
2 in DS [GWEP1332 and GWEP1424], 2 in LGS [GWEP1414 and GWEP1423]; clinical pharmacology: 1 
in epilepsy [GWEP1428]); interim data was also included from an ongoing DS and LGS patient open-
label extension (OLE) trial (GWEP1415), and an ongoing clinical pharmacology trial in epilepsy patients 
(GWEP1447). 
Additionally, population PK and exposure-response analyses were conducted based on the data 
collected during the CBD-OS clinical development program. 
A PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis looking at QTc was conducted as part of the TQT trial. 
Absorption 
The PK of Cannabidiol (CBD) has been studied in healthy volunteers, patients and in special 
populations.  
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 45/190 
 
Bioavailability of CBD was approximately 6.5 % following oral administration in fasting conditions. Due 
to significant food effect observed the bioavailability following administration with food can be expected 
around 14-25%. The effect of a high fat meal on the PK of a single 1500 mg CBD OS dose in healthy 
male and female subjects was studied in a randomized 2 period crossover period, incorporating 12 
randomly selected subjects (mean age 25 years) from the SAD arm.  There was a 10-day washout 
between periods. The results for Cmax and AUC of CBD are tabulated below: 
Table 6 Summary of Food Effect 
Note: Food effect was explored using a mixed effect (ANOVA) model with treatment, period and sequence as fixed factors, and subject within 
sequence as a random factor. 
*: with values based on %AUCextra>30 excluded. 
There was a significant period effect for CBD parent compound (period 2 has higher values than period 3) 
CBD Tmax ranged from 2-5 h with maximal plasma levels mostly observed at 4-5 hours following 
single oral dose. At steady state Tmax of CBD is approximately 3 hours (range 2.5-5 h). Significant 
food effect was observed in the conducted fed study and both Cmax and AUC was 4-5-times increased 
following administration of study drug with standard high fat meal. Tmax was not significantly affected 
by administration with food.   
Study GWEP1424 has been presented with the applicant’s responses to the D180 List of Outstanding 
Issues. A secondary objective was to determine (PK) of CBD and its major metabolites following single 
and multiple doses of GWP42003-P and to assess the presence of THC and its major metabolites in 
plasma and the presence of THC, CBD and their major metabolites in urine after multiple doses of 
CBD.  Subjects < 20 kg were not included due to limitation in the volume of blood samples required. 
Furthermore, urinary PK was not conducted as there were only a few patients who consented but were 
unable to provide samples. Thus, PK data from GWEP1424 are limited. PK results reported are 
consistent with previously reported results. 
Distribution and Elimination 
Plasma concentrations appear to follow a biphasic pattern suggesting a distribution into peripheral 
compartments. Apparent volume of distribution ranged in healthy volunteers for single doses of 
between 200 and 6000 mg CBD-OS from 2820 to 42849 L. A radiolabelled (ADME) study was not 
conducted. Literature data submitted by the applicant suggest that only about 8% of the total dose of 
IV administered CBD is present in plasma at the peak of radioactivity and the rest is redistributed in 
tissues. In the absence of an ADME study, it is important to clarify the metabolic routes for oral CBD-
OS. Study GWEP17075 evaluated the impact of selective inhibitors on the clearance of CBD and 
exposure to the major metabolites. It showed that itraconazole (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) did not affect 
CBD exposure and caused only minor increases in 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD) (17%) and 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 46/190 
 
 
 
7-carboxy-cannabidiol (7-COOH-CBD) (12%) exposure (AUC0-t).  Fluconazole (a potent CYP2C19 
inhibitor) had only a minor effect on CBD exposure (approximately 20% increase) and caused small 
decreases in 7-OH-CBD (29%) and 7-COOH-CBD (34%) exposure (AUC0-t). From in vitro studies, 
plasma protein binding – mainly to albumin – is high, about 92-99%. Free fractions were studied in 
relation to studies in subject with hepatic impairment. 
In a human study (GWEP1540) using titrated CBD, CBD and 7-OH-CBD were present in very low 
quantities whilst 7-COOH-CBD metabolite was detected in all subjects with normal renal function, 
however levels of urinary elimination of conjugated products were not evaluated. About 16% of the 
total dose was excreted in urine within 72 hours, indicating that renal excretion is a minor route of 
excretion for CBD.  A large proportion of CBD was excreted unchanged in faeces. In humans, hepatic 
clearance is a major route of CBD metabolism.  The mean CL/F of CBD in healthy subjects ranged 
between 375 and 1909 L/h (fasted after a single CBD-OS dose of between 200-6000 mg). 
In healthy subjects, the terminal t½ was approximately 60 hours after multiple b.i.d. dosing, although 
using 2 compartmental modelling (population PK) in healthy volunteers and in LGS patient data 
suggested there may be a longer terminal slope with t½ estimates of between 85 hours and 202 
hours.  The population PK estimate of CBD CL/F after oral administration was 35.5 L/h, assuming a 
typical body weight of 70 kg from the population PK analysis. 
CBD is extensively metabolized in vivo, likely following first pass effect by gut and liver metabolism.  
The main isoforms responsible for phase I metabolism of CBD are CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent 
CYP3A4.  Phase II metabolism is mediated by uridine 5’ diphospho glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 
subtype 2B7 (UGT2B7), UGT1A7, and UGT1A9. The major CBD metabolites identified in human 
hepatocytes were 7 carboxy cannabidiol (7-COOH-CBD) and 7-hydroxy cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD). 
CYP2C19 is likely to be the major enzyme in vitro responsible for the hydroxylation of CBD to 7-OH-
CBD.  CYP3A4 is likely to be the major enzyme responsible for the further oxidation of 7-OH-CBD to 7-
COOH-CBD. 6-hydroxy cannabidiol (6-OH-CBD) was identified as a CBD metabolite in HLMs, and 
CYP3A4 is likely responsible for its production. The most abundant metabolite was 7-COOH-CBD which 
was identified as having little or no intrinsic anticonvulsant efficacy. The exposure was 29-46 times 
higher than the mother compound. 7-OH-CBD was identified as an active metabolite with similar 
activity to CBD was present in lower concentrations than CBD, at approximately 40-60% of parent 
drug exposure. 
The metabolite to parent ratios for 7-OH-CBD and 6-OH-CBD in healthy subjects were comparable with 
values observed in both patient populations, for 7-COOH-CBD there was very high variability among 
trials however significant difference between healthy subjects and patient population was not 
observed. 
Based on in vitro data and the literature, the major metabolic pathways of CBD in human tissue are 
shown in the figure below.

The PK of metabolites are reported and assessed in relation to the parent drug throughout the 
assessment report.  
The applicant presents post-hoc analysis of PK data as related to polymorphisms on CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4. The main inferential results pertaining to the CYP2C19 data are illustrated below:

Figure 6 Relationship between CBD AUCtau and CYP2C19 Phenotypes in Subjects 
from Group 2, 4 and 6, Period 1, CBD-OS Alone 
The frequencies of the CYP2C19 phenotypes were EM (34/77) > UM (27/77) > IM (11/77) > PM 
(1/77); 4 subjects were undetermined metabolizers. In Group 1, in the 1 subject with a CYP2C19 IM 
phenotype, steady-state exposure to N-CLB was consistent with their phenotype (highest Cmax and 
AUCtau values in Group 1).  Apart from 1 CYP2C19 UM subject with very low steady-state N-CLB 
exposure in the absence of GWP42003P and the highest treatment ratio of all subjects, there were no 
other notable differences between N-CLB exposures in EMs vs. UMs. Across Groups 2, 4 and 6, 
exposure to steady-state CBD tended to be higher in subjects with CYP2C19 UM phenotypes and 
lowest in subjects with CYP2C19 IM phenotype. So far data are too limited to draw conclusions of the 
effect of genotype on the CBD pharmacokinetics.   
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
From study GWEP1544, the time-concentration profile of CBD at different oral single doses is 
illustrated below in children and adults:

Figure 7  Geometric Mean Plasma Concentrations of CBD Over Time after 
Administration of Single Doses of CBD-OS during Fasted Conditions, 
Semilogarithmic Scale (PK Set) 
The following observations were made: 
• CBD appeared rapidly in plasma following single doses. 
• The plasma concentration-by-time profiles for the CBD metabolites were similar. Cmax was followed 
by multiphasic decline. 
• CBD and its metabolites were detectable in plasma at 48 hours post dose at all dose levels. 
Time dependency 
From study GWEP1544, the following summary data on repeated dose PK of CBD at two different doses 
are reported. 
Mean plasma concentrations are illustrated below: 
Figure 8 Mean Plasma Concentrations (Day 1 am/pm and Day 7 am with Ctrough 
on Intermediate Days) of CBD Over Time After Administration of Multiple Doses of 
CBD-OS During Fasted Conditions (PK Set) 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 50/190 
 
 
 
Steady state for CBD (based on trough values) was observed after 2-3 days. At steady state, there 
was a near doubling in exposure (Cmax and AUC) for a doubling in CBD-OS dose (750 and 1500 mg). 
Following repeated dose administration there was moderate accumulation (Rac = 1.8) after 7 days of 
multiple b.i.d. dosing, the extent of which was similar for CBD metabolites except for 7-COOH-CBD, 
which had a Rac of 4.5. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The pharmacokinetics of CBD and major metabolites was characterized in both the LGS and DS patient 
population. The applicant characterized PK at two (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) respectively three (5, 10, 20 
mg/kg/day) dose levels and the final dose was applied following titration phase. Summary PK from 
study GWEP1332 in children, DS, (mean age 7.6 years) observations from 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/day 
doses are tabulated below:

Based on the above results, it can be concluded that exposure to CBD and its metabolites increases in 
a dose-related manner (over the dose range of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day), with no major deviation from 
dose proportionality.  
Study GWEP1423, double-blind 14-week treatment period efficacy trial in 171 LGS patients (mean age 
15.42 years) investigated the PK of CBD and its major metabolites following single and MDs of 20 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS (or placebo [1:1 ratio]), as well as the effects of CBD-OS on CLB (and N-CLB), and 
other AEDs if taken as concomitant medications. Summary PK observations are tabulated below, for

The Applicant presents three different PoP-PK models: healthy volunteer data; LGS adults, and children 
with DS. The single- and multiple-dose arms of a healthy subject trial (GWEP1544) was used for the 
construction of a POPPK model which was then applied to the pivotal trials in adults and children with 
LGS, and to a lesser extent in children with DS. A detailed assessment evaluation of all three individual 
models is not performed as they were developed in a similar setup and model evaluation performances 
were comparable. The LGS model was evaluated in detail. 
LGS model:  
The population PK analysis was performed using Non-Linear Mixed Effect modelling analysis in 
NONMEM. 
The population PK model previously developed in healthy adult subjects was transposed to the current 
patient population with LGS.  
Covariate Models for Parent Drug and Metabolites 
Selection of Potential Covariates and Rationale for Selection 
Given the scope of the present project, potential covariates were the following: age, sex, baseline drop 
seizure, race, WT, unit dose of CBD, ketogenic diet, concomitant AEDs, CYP2C19 inhibitors, CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers. The baseline WT was included upfront as a structural covariate as a part of the 
patient population is paediatric. Owing to the short trial duration and the available data, only the 
baseline WT was considered. 
Base model structure  
The structure of the base model includes 2-compartments with linear disposition for CBD. Apparent 
central volumes of distribution were set to 1 L for both metabolites to prevent structural identifiability 
issues. Apparent clearances and volumes of distribution were independent on baseline WT. 
CBD absorption followed zero-order absorption kinetics without lag time with a constant duration (D1).

Covariate selection 
Potential covariates were the following: age, sex, baseline drop seizure, race, WT, unit dose of CBD, 
ketogenic diet, concomitant AEDs, CYP2C19 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. The baseline 
WT was included upfront as a structural covariate as a part of the patient population is paediatric.  
Model validation 
The GOF plots showed that CBD, 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD observations were in good agreement 
with their respective population and individual predictions. No trends were observed on the CWRES 
plots versus time or versus population predictions demonstrating the adequacy of the model structure 
to describe the time course of CBD, 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD concentrations. 
The final model pcVPC is illustrated below:

Exploratory Covariate Screening and Covariate Analysis 
None of the covariates were included in the final population PK model, which was therefore identical to 
the base model.

Simulation of exposure in children 
Children aged 2-17 years: 
The trial design used for simulation of CBD plasma concentration-time profiles following oral 
administration in children aged 2-17 years, was based on the studies GWEP1414 and GWEP1423 
Children aged 1-24 months: 
A series of simulations were run using the paediatric CBD-OS PBPK model to predict the concentration 
time-profiles of CBD in children aged 1 to 24 months. Application of the adult CBD-OS PBPK model 
within the paediatric simulator failed to adequately predict the observed paediatric plasma CBD 
concentration-time profiles and an increase in the fa to 0.45 for the paediatric model was required. 
This could be related to the intake of food in the patients, however, protocols for studies GWEP1414 
and GWEP1423 did not contain any information regarding the prandial state of the patients, nor is

there any information regarding the impact of food on CBD PK in paediatric populations to support this 
assumption. Furthermore, the limited number of individuals less than 6 years old restricted the 
comparison at the most sensitive age group studied. 
Predicted plasma concentrations of CBD on Day 14 of multiple oral dosing with CBD OS (10 mg/kg 
b.i.d.) to children aged 1-24 months, 2-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-17 years were simulated.

Impaired renal function 
The effect of reduced renal function was studied in study GWEP1540 in subjects with mild (CLCR 50 to 
80 ml/min), moderate (CLCR 30 to < 50 ml/min), and severe (CLCR < 30 ml/min) renal impairment 
compared with subjects with normal renal function (CLCR > 80 ml/min). Patients with end-stage renal 
disease have not been specifically studied in the CBD-OS development programme.   
Time concentration profiles for CBD are tabulated below:

For the main metabolites, 6- and 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD, similar patterns are documented: no 
differences were apparent. These data do not signify any difference between groups pertaining to renal 
excretion of CBD and its metabolites. 
Urine concentrations of CBD and metabolites were below the limit of quantification (< 2 ng/ml) for 
most subjects at most time points, or detectable only at trace concentrations. 
Impaired hepatic function 
The effect of impaired hepatic function was studied in study GWEP1539 in subjects with mild (Child-
Pugh Grade A, Score: 5–6), moderate (Child-Pugh Grade B, Score: 7–9), or severe (Child Pugh Grade 
C, Score: 10–15) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. 
The main results for CBD PK are presented below:

cPercent extrapolation ≤ 30% was required to retain AUC(0-∞) for unbound and total fractions; 
subjects that did not satisfy this criterion were excluded from the analysis. 
dPercent extrapolation ≤ 30% and r2> 0.80 was required to retain t½; subjects that did not satisfy 
these criteria were excluded from the analysis. 
For CBD and 7-OH-CBD, there were consistently > 2-fold increases in both total and unbound Cmax, 
AUC (0-∞) and AUC(0-t) in the moderate and severe hepatic impairment groups, compared with 
subjects with normal hepatic function, with the following exceptions: 
7-OH-CBD: the increase approached 2-fold (was 1.92-fold) for AUC (0 t) in the moderate hepatic 
impairment group compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. 
For 7-COOH-CBD, both total and unbound Cmax were unchanged in moderate/normal, reduced slightly 
in mild/normal and greatly reduced in severe/normal (ratio of geometric least squared means was 
approximately 0.3 and the upper and lower 90% CI were less than 1.0). The ratios for total and 
unbound 7-COOH-CBD AUC (0-∞) and AUC (0-t) showed some fluctuations with hepatic impairment 
relative to normal hepatic function; however, except for AUC (0-t) in the severe hepatic impairment 
group, the 90% CI all included 1. 
The ratio of geometric LS means comparing CBD CL/F between hepatic impairment groups and the 
normal hepatic function group was reduced in all cases (upper and lower limits of 90%CI were < 1.0 in 
all cases except for total CL/F in the mild hepatic impairment group relative to normal hepatic function 
[upper limit was 1.11]), and was lowest in the severe hepatic impairment. 
Simulated exposures for the proposed dose adjustment in hepatic impaired patients are displayed 
below. Simulated exposures achieved in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were similar to

exposures in subjects with normal hepatic function when the dosing recommendations provided in the 
SmPC were applied. However, simulated exposures for subjects with severe hepatic impairment were 
approximately half those for subjects with normal hepatic function. In the SmPC the applicant has 
adequately addressed that CBD efficacy may be reduced in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Race 
Data were insufficient for a specific analysis. Please refer to PoP-PK analysis.  
Weight 
No specific analysis of weight on the PK of CBD from individual studies has been made. The PoP-PK 
analysis suggest some difference in exposure in subjects weighing less than 60 kg: 
During initial model development, body weight was included allometric through relationships on 
clearance and volume parameters as part of the structural population PK model for CBD, 7-OH-CBD 
and 7-COOH-CBD (GWPP17004).  When estimating the allometric coefficients, they converged to 0, 
indicating no effect of body weight on these parameters. 
Consistent with this, no effects of body weight on any of the PK parameters were found in LGS patients 
as part of covariate analyses.  The proposed mg/kg dose for CBD OS therefore results in somewhat 
lower exposures in the lowest weight (paediatric) subjects. 
The details of the complete datasets from trials GWEP1414 and GWEP1423 that were used as source 
data included in the POPPK model were not specifically included in the GWPP17004 PK report.  These 
details are now detailed in the table below. Only 20/216 subjects had a baseline body weight < 20 kg.

The GWEP1414 protocol was amended to exclude collection of blood samples from patients < 20 kg.  
The figure 12 below shows the distribution of weight data within the PK analysis sets from both 
GWEP1414 and GWEP1423 and there was no truncation in baseline weight data.

Elderly 
Not applicable; no patient above the age of 55 was included. 
Children 
There were changes in CBD and metabolite exposure with age in LGS patients (exposures were higher 
in older [18 to 55-year old] patients compared with younger [2 to 17 year old] patients) at both trial 
visits where PK were investigated. Exposure simulations from the PoP-PK model did not recover these 
findings in that age did not have a significant effect on the PK of CBD at the given weight-based 
posology. However, age was evaluated as a covariate of the POPPK model in patients with LGS only.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In Vitro 
In vitro data suggest that clinically relevant DDIs between CBD and other drugs may be relevant for a 
number of enzymes and transporters involved. 
CYP and UGT inhibition and induction 
CBD is a direct reversible inhibitor of major hepatic CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. Typical IC50 values were < 10 μM [except CYP2C9, CYP2E1, and CYP2D6 with 
IC50 > 10 μM]).  The most potent reversible inhibition was observed with CYP3A4.  CBD is also a time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 in vitro. CBD shows a positive inductive effect on CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, and CYP3A4. CBD shows potent inhibition of UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-
CBD inhibited the major UGT isoenzymes (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7) 
with IC50 values ranging from 5 to 70 µM. 
CBD as substrate inhibitor or inductor of transporters 
In vitro, CBD does not appear to be a substrate of or inhibitor of major transporters including p-
glycoprotein, OATP1B2, OATP2B1: 
CBD is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) multidrug resistance protein 1. CBD is not a substrate 
or inhibitor of brain transporters organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 1A2 or OATP2B1. 7-OH-
CBD and 7-COOH-CBD are not substrates of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT1. 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 64/190 
 
 
CBD and 7-OH-CBD do not inhibit the major renal or hepatic uptake transporters. 
7-OH-CBD does not inhibit OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation 
transporter (OCT)2, OCT1, or multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)2-K; at other transporters 7-OH-
CBD is a weak inhibitor. 
7-COOH-CBD does not inhibit OCT2, OCT1, MATE1, or MATE2 K; 7-COOH-CBD weakly inhibits P-gp, 
OAT1, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, and bile salt export pump. 
Based on plasma exposures, there is a potential for 7-COOH-CBD to interact with BCRP, OAT3 and 
OATP1B3 in vivo. 
In silico 
The final adult PBPK model for CBD-OS was based on both in vitro and in vivo data.  Predicted 
geometric mean AUC(0-24h) and Cmax ratios for various test CYP450 and UGT substrates in the 
absence and presence of CBD OS (750 mg b.i.d. for 7 days), administered to subjects of various ages

The influence of concomitant administration of several drugs, CLB, LEV, TPM, VPA, paracetamol and 
lamotrigine on CBD has been evaluated as part of a population PK model in LGS patients.  Dedicated 
Clinical DDIs studies have been conducted in patients (clobazam) and in healthy volunteers (clobazam, 
stiripentol and valproate). 
In vivo 
Stiripentol, clobazam and valproate in healthy volunteers. 
Study GWEP1543 was a clinical DDI open-label, fixed sequence DDI trial determined whether steady 
state CBD-OS (750 mg b.i.d. or placebo) affected the PK profiles of steady state antiepileptics, CLB (5 
mg), STP (750 mg) or VPA (300-500 mg), and vice versa (effect of AEDs on CBD-PK).  It was designed 
as 6 parallel groups of 12 healthy subjects (except in Groups 2 [CBD OS and CLB] and 6 [CBD OS and 
VPA], which recruited 15 and 14 subjects, respectively). In all DDI studies, all investigational drugs 
were administered 30 minutes after a non-standardized meal. 
The main inferential PK analyses are illustrated and tabulated below.

Figure 13 Effect of CBD on AEDs 
Concomitant administration of clobazam and CBD resulted in noticeable DDIs: a 2-4-fold increase in 
the active N-clobazam exposure and while no or minor effect of clobazam on CBD, and increase in 
exposure to the main active metabolites -7-OH-CBD of about 30 to 70%.  
A minor effect on stiripentol exposure was found with exposure increases in stiripentol AUC of about 
55% and Cmax of about 28%. 
For main inferential result, please refer to the figure 12. Concomitant administration of CBD and 
clobazam resulted in a 2-3-fold exposure to the main active metabolite of clobazam, N-clobazam. This 
result is, while of a lesser order of magnitude, consistent with the findings in healthy volunteers. 
The applicant is in the process of re-evaluating the DDI potential for CBD by updating the PBPK model.  
The new model will include influences of the metabolites on various enzyme systems.  In addition, a 
number of DDI studies have either been completed, are ongoing, or planned.  Data from these studies 
will also be used to inform the improved PBPK DDI predictions. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Potential for confounding of efficacy attributable to either CBD-OS, CLB or STP during concomitant use 
was investigated. 
The relationships between the exposures of CBD, 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD, and safety as 
characterized by the occurrence of selected AEs were investigated in LGS patients through exploratory 
logistic regression analyses. The following AEs were included in the exploratory analyses: alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) > 2 × ULN, ALT > 2 × ULN, AST > 2 × ULN, bilirubin > 2 × ULN, diarrhoea, 
fatigue, GGT > 2 × ULN, loss of appetite, maculopapular rash, nausea, rash, and somnolence. 
An overview of statistically significant associations is tabulated below.

Note: ++, p<0.01 and positive correlation; +, p<0.05 and positive correlation. Yes and No columns indicate the numbers of subjects with at least 
1 of the given AE (Yes) or not (No). 
Consistent, highly statistically significant correlations were observed across the 3 analytes (p<0.01 for 
CBD and 7-OH-CBD; p<0.05 for 7-COOH-CBD) for ALT > 2 × ULN, AST > 2 × ULN (except 7-COOH-
CBD), loss of appetite, and somnolence; increasing exposure to CBD and its metabolites appeared to 
be associated with an increased frequency of these types of AEs. There was a correlation between the 
AUCs of CBD and the metabolites, so it was not possible to distinguish between the effect of CBD and 
the metabolites on response endpoints, nor was this analysis intended to conclude on the activity of 
the metabolites.   
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The exact mechanism of action of CBD is not completely elucidated. CBD is a cannabinoid but shares 
none of the pharmacologic features of the archetypal cannabinoid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  
CBD has negligible affinity or activity at either the cannabinoid (CB1 or CB2) receptors in vitro, and is 
negative in the tetrad test, an accepted bioassay for CB1 agonism.  
However, the main mechanisms which contribute to the CBD activity are modulation of intracellular 
Ca2+ levels and adenosine re-uptake inhibition. Modulation of intracellular Ca2+ is influenced through 
inhibition of GPR55 (G-protein coupled receptor) and TRPV1 (Transient receptor potential vanilloid). 
GPR55 is a trans-membrane receptor which increases the intracellular Ca2+ levels via release of IP3-
gated intracellular stores. CBD acts as a GPR55 antagonist and doing so prevents from increase in the 
intracellular Ca2+levels, thus excitatory neurotransmission. The other possible GPR55 activity is 
regulation of neuro-inflammatory processes. As neuro-inflammation participates in development and 
maintenance of epilepsy, potential to attenuate inflammatory activity could contribute to the 
anticonvulsant effects.  
TRPV1 channel is a non-selective ion channel. Its activation results in desensitisation and consequent 
decrease in Ca2+ influx. Therefore, modulation of the activity of this channel also contributes to the 
decrease in the neuronal excitability.  
The other involved mechanism is inhibition of adenosine re-uptake leading to increase in an adenosine 
extracellular concentration. Adenosine acts via A1 and A2A receptors as an anticonvulsant and anti-
Assessment report

inflammatory agent. Increasing of the extracellular adenosine level makes adenosine available for the 
activation of these receptors.   
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Human abuse liability 
GWEP1431 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled crossover 
trial evaluated the abuse potential of single doses of 750, 1500, and 4500 mg CBD OS compared with 
alprazolam (2 mg), dronabinol (10 and 30 mg) and placebo in 95 healthy recreational polydrug users 
(mean age 37.7 years). Plasma concentrations of CBD, its main metabolites, THC and its main 
metabolites were measured. Primary pharmacodynamic outcome was scored in Drug Liking VAS (E

placebo at the 2 higher dose levels, mean Emax with alprazolam 2 mg and dronabinol 30 mg were 
markedly higher (≥ 15 points compared to placebo and all doses of GWP42003-P), with an intermediate 
value observed for dronabinol 10 mg. Median Drug Liking VAS Emax values for GWP42003-P doses 
were even lower, while median scores with alprazolam 2 mg and dronabinol 10 mg doses were similar 
to mean scores, or in the case of dronabinol 30 mg, slightly higher. While alprazolam and GWP42003-P 
4500 mg were associated with the lowest mean Drug Liking VAS Emin values, mean values for all 
active treatments were relatively similar to placebo and median scores for all treatments were 50.0, 
indicating little or no disliking.

LS means were estimated from a mixed-effects model having treatment, period, treatment sequence 
as fixed effects, sex as a covariate, and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. Treatment 
effect was significant (p<0.0001), whilst period (p=0.2243), treatment sequence (p=0.4552) and sex 
(p=0.8615) were not significant; carryover effect was not significant at the 25% level and dropped 
from the model. 
Plasma concentrations of THC and/or its metabolites were present in 14/40 subjects predose in Period 
1, indicating a degree of carryover from previous Cannabis use. In all CBD-OS dose groups, there were 
subjects with THC plasma concentrations BLQ at all postdose time points (12/26, 4/35 and 12/28 in 
the 750, 1500 and 4500 mg CBD-OS groups, respectively). 
With CBD-OS treatment, THC plasma concentrations were low, consistent with levels of the impurity in 
the product, and were much lower than those detected with dronabinol. The therapeutic 750 mg CBD-
OS dose showed little significant and no consistent abuse potential. Higher (high therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic) CBD-OS doses (1500 and 4500 mg, respectively) were associated with detectable 
subjective effects that were significantly lower than those of the positive controls, alprazolam and 
dronabinol, and not indicative of clinically important abuse potential. These results suggest that CBD-
OS is associated with a minimal signal for abuse potential. 
Study GWEP1542 was a randomized, double-blind trial, using a single-blind baseline, to assess 
withdrawal symptoms after prolonged treatment with CBD-OS. Reported scores on the Cannabis 
Withdrawal Scale (CWS) and Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC-20) were low throughout the 
trial and no increases were seen after the abrupt discontinuation of CBD-OS. No scores were of clinical 
concern during the trial. Based on these results it can be concluded an abrupt discontinuation of CBD 
at steady state does not appear to induce withdrawal symptoms. 
The results of GWEP1448 study showed no significant effect of CBD-OS on total sleep time (TST). It 
can be concluded that CBD does not appear to affect sleeping quality in healthy adult volunteers. 
Somnolence was a frequent adverse event in the clinical studies in children.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The relationships between the exposures of CBD, 7-OH CBD and 7-COOH-CBD, and efficacy in terms of 
effect on the occurrence of seizures were investigated in LGS patients through exploratory logistic 
regression analyses.  In these analyses, the concomitant use of CLB was also included as a potential 
covariate on the exposure response slope. 
The main analysis from logistic regression are illustrated below.

Logistic regression analysis suggests a positive exposure-response relationship for the occurrence of 
drop seizure response across the dose range tested (placebo, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day).  There was a 
significant positive correlation between the derived AUC of CBD at Visit 8 and the probability of a 
subject being a drop seizure responder.  Similar correlations were observed for 7-OH-CBD and 7-

COOH-CBD. In DS patients no data is presented as this comprise much smaller patient numbers and 
patients who had infrequent seizures. No correlations were likely to materialize. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A national GLP inspection questioned the validity and reliability of the bioanalytical data in the 
preclinical studies. As similar analytical methods were used throughout the clinical pharmacology 
studies, serious concerns were raised about the validity of the results of the above-mentioned PK 
studies. 
Consequently, for all studies comprising  analyses of CBD, CLB, THC, STP, VPA, LEV, TPM (and its main 
metabolites), the applicant was requested to clarify the extent of Non-GLP/GCP compliance in details 
and discuss the impact of these findings on the reliability of the results.  
Furthermore, an EMA GCP- inspection was triggered of a number of studies: GWEP1544, GWEP1428, 
GWEP1543, GWEP1332, GWEP1423, and GWEP1414 with special focus on the analytical quality and 
the nature of any GCP deviations.  
Several concerns were raised during the EMA GCP-inspection. Despite the fact that the concerns and 
deficiencies were related to GCP compliance and integrity of the data, the inspector recommended the 
efficacy data for the assessment. The inspector´s conclusion was that the analysis of the samples and 
the PK calculations were conducted in overall compliance with national legislation and ICH-GCP.  The 
bioanalytical results generated across the trials are comparable without suspicious deviations and are 
not significantly devalued by the exclusion of a small amount of metabolites data. Therefore, the CHMP 
considered that the overall PK/PD data included in the MA application was valid. 
The pharmacokinetics of CBD and its main metabolites have been studied in healthy volunteers and in 
the target populations of DS and LGS patients. A substantial proportion of the patients studied is below 
the age of 18 years. Generally, the pharmacokinetics have been studied in accordance with the 
scientific requirements. Reported results appear consistent across studies.  
Bioavailability of CBD was approximately 6.5 % following oral administration in fasting conditions. 
Cannabidiol appears rapidly in plasma with a time to maximum plasma concentration of 2.5–5 hours at 
steady state. However, distribution is expected to be similar to animal species. 
The Applicant has presented data illustrating that concomitant intake of food greatly increases AUC and 
Cmax exposure to CBD-OS (about 4-fold) and major metabolites, including active metabolites, (about 
2-fold) in healthy volunteers. It is unknown how this affects efficacy and safety as no restrictions 
related to concomitant food intake were included in the protocols of the phase 3 clinical studies. In 
addition, no data with regards to dosing in relations to meals were collected. The applicant proposes 
that CBD-OS should be administered with a meal. It is acknowledged that the proposed posology reads 
that dosage should be titrated taking into consideration response and tolerability, and furthermore that 
the CBD efficacy data presented is achieved on random fed status information. However, from the 
submitted data it is not possible to define the conditions under which CBD-OS should be administered. 
In order to alleviate this concern and provide meaningful instructions to the prescriber and patients, 
the applicant proposed that CBD-OS is administered consistently either with or without food intake. 
This proposal was found acceptable by the CHMP and reflected in SmPC section 4.2 and PL. 
Approximately 16% of an oral dose of CBD is excreted in the urine after 72 hours suggesting renal 
excretion be a minor elimination pathway. However, a 72 hours urine collection period appears to be 
very a short period to obtain a reasonable estimate of the cumulative amount of drug excreted 
unchanged in the urine, as CBD-OS T1/2 has been estimated from 51-202 hours.  A large proportion of 
CBD was excreted unchanged in faeces. In humans, hepatic clearance is a major route of CBD

Page 73/190 
 
metabolism.  The mean CL/F of CBD in healthy subjects ranged between 375 and 1909 L/h (fasted 
after a single CBD-OS dose of between 200-6000 mg). 
The metabolism of CBD has been appropriately studied in vitro. CBD undergoes extensive CYP-
mediated metabolism to primary (active) and main (likely inactive) secondary metabolism. The main 
P450 enzymes are CYP2C19 which catalyses the formation of active metabolites 6-OH and, mainly, 7-
OH-CBD. In turn CYP3A4 catalyses the inactivation of 7-OH-CBD to 7-COOH-CBD. This suggest that 
polymorphism in CYP2C19 maybe of clinical relevance to PK of CBD.  When investigated, the number 
of different CYP2C19 phenotypes was too small, and no conclusion could be made.  Study GWEP17075 
investigated the relative contributions of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of CBD. It showed 
that itraconazole (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) did not affect CBD exposure and caused only minor 
increases in 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD) (17%) and 7-carboxy-cannabidiol (7-COOH-CBD) 
(12%) exposure (AUC0-t).  Fluconazole (a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor) had only a minor effect on CBD 
exposure (approximately 20% increase) and caused small decreases in 7-OH-CBD (29%) and 7-COOH-
CBD (34%) exposure (AUC 0-t).  These results suggest that CBD exposure would be unaffected in 
subjects/patients with genetic variants of these enzymes leading to decreased catalytic activity. In 
addition, that it is thought that the multiple metabolic enzymes involved in the metabolism of CBD are 
able to compensate should one pathway be inhibited or dysfunctional. 
The Applicant has illustrated and presented data in healthy subjects in accordance with a substantial 
less than dose-proportional relation between dose and exposure of CBD and its primary metabolites in 
the dose-interval from 1500 mg to 6000 mg. The dose-ranging PK of CBD-OS was also studied in 
patients. In DS patients aged 4–10 years old (GWEP1332 Part A), exposure (AUC) to CBD and its 
metabolites increased in a dose-related manner after multiple doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day CBD-
OS (GWEP1332 CSR). A POPPK model in patients with LGS, which contained data from more patients 
over a wider age range, predicted that with a doubling in dose (from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS), 
there would be a near doubling in CBD plasma exposure (AUC) (GWPP17004). The suggested 
saturation observed for absorption at supra-therapeutic CBD doses is in accordance with the zero-order 
absorption kinetics reported, and therefore accepted. 
Inter-individual variability (IIV) of clearance and apparent volume of distribution is substantial, with 
CV% estimates of about 30 to 90% (and higher in DS patients for clearance), for CBD and its main 
metabolites. The applicant was requested to analyse repeated dose data for intra-individual variability 
of the principal PK parameters. Subsequently, the applicant has presented a joint population PK model 
for CBD, 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD, which was developed using data from 11 trials. All structural 
components (i.e., typical PK parameters) as well as variability (i.e., IIV and RUV) terms have been 
retested, which is endorsed. Inter-individual variability was significant for Q12 (drop of the objective 
function value > −3.84 i.e., p-value < 0.05) leading to a stable, converging model as well as a good 
precision on the IIV Q12 (RSE=14.6%).  Noticeably the RSE of VP2 was also much improved (0.9%) 
(GWPP18097). The population model predictions corresponded well to the observed concentrations for 
CBD, 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD in the pooled population. 
The applicant has presented several PoP-PK models in healthy volunteers and in the target 
populations. The models are overall presented in accordance with the EMA Guideline on reporting the 
results of population pharmacokinetic analyses (Doc.ref. CHMP/EWP/185990/06, June 2007).  CBD 
displayed linear two-compartmental PK while 1 compartment for each metabolite, and zero-order 
absorption. None of the included covariates were included in the final model. However, the Applicant 
should test additional weight covariates. Missing information regarding the impact of food on CBD PK in 
the paediatric population is considered problematic for the interpretation of the PK models developed in 
paediatric patients, and results of the simulated exposures in children. Furthermore, in accordance with 
RMP, missing data in children < 2 years is problematic due to relevance for Dravet patients. The 
applicant confirmed that the development of an updated PBPK model is ongoing.  Information from the 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019

latest population PK modelling will be incorporated (GWPP18097).  However, in order to obtain the 
most refined and predictive model, the plan is to wait for data from multiple ongoing drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) trials which will provide crucial data to support the understanding of contributions 
from metabolic enzymes.  These data including an updated PBPK model will be available in the first 
quarter of the calendar year 2020. The investigation into potential sampling techniques for very young 
patients has been initiated.  When available, this will be applied to any trials involving patients under 
2 years of age. At this point in time, no specific trials have been identified/scheduled so no specific 
timelines are available. This plan was found acceptable by the CHMP. 
The PK of CBD and its metabolites have been studied in patients with varying degrees of renal 
impairment. The PK of CBD and its metabolites was not affected in patients, who had mild (CLCR 50-
80 ml/min) to severe (CLCR <30 ml/min) renal impairment. Patients with end-stage renal disease 
(CLCR< 15 ml/min) were not studied and this information has been included in the SmPC.  
The PK of CBD has been studied in subjects with impaired hepatic function. There was a substantial 
increase in AUC and Cmax exposure to CBD and its active metabolite (7-OH-CBD) in subjects with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment versus subjects with normal hepatic function; AUC exposures 
increased about 2.5 and 5-fold, respectively, while Cmax exposure were about 2-3 fold for CBD. In 
subjects with mild hepatic impairment an increase in total Cmax and AUC about 1.5 was observed for 
CBD, and 1.3 for 7-OH-CBD. Unbound CBD was not affected. Therefore, the CHMP found acceptable 
the applicant’s SmPC proposal to recommend a lower starting dose and target dose for patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Simulated exposures achieved in patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment were similar to exposures in subjects with normal hepatic function when the dosing 
recommendations provided in the SmPC were applied. However, simulated exposures for subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment were approximately half those for subjects with normal hepatic function. 
This finding is adequately reflected in the SmPC by the wording included in section 4.2 which indicates 
that efficacy may be reduced in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. 
Crude PK data from efficacy trials in children suggest a lower exposure to CBD and its primary 
metabolites in children below the age of 18 compared to adults. Exposure simulations from the PoP-PK 
model did not recover these findings in that age did not have a significant effect on the PK of CBD at 
the given weight-based posology. These findings are pertinent to the sought indication and primary 
patient population and must be further pursued. The applicant should present and comment on cross-
trial actual data stratified by age groups according to EMA Guidelines. Furthermore, based on PoP-PK 
analysis (GWPP17004, based on data from GWEP1414 and GWEP1423), systemic exposure to CBD 
appears to be significantly reduced in subjects weighing less than 60 kg. This likely reflects allometric 
scaling effect suggesting no isolated effect from body weight. In order to address the concerns, the 
applicant conducted a pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis (POPPK) in subjects and patients 
participating in trials GWEP1544, GWEP1332A, GWEP1414, GWEP1423, GWEP1428, GWEP1539, 
GWEP1540, GWEP1541, GWEP1543, GWEP1446 and GWEP17028. The objective was to develop a joint 
population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for cannabidiol (CBD) and 2 major circulating metabolites 7-
hydroxy cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD) and 7-carboxy-cannabidiol (7-COOH-CBD), based on the data 
collected in healthy adult subjects, adult subjects with various degrees of renal and hepatic 
impairments, adult patients with epilepsy, patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and patients with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS).  The analysis focused on several potential covariates, such as 
baseline body weight, unit dose of GWP42003-P, prandial state, body mass index, age and concomitant 
medications. The results showed IIV was high in the pooled PK data for all PK parameters ranging from 
47-113% probably due to unknown food status in most of the subjects. Nevertheless, the analysis did 
not identify significant impact of gender age, race on PK parameters of CBD. It can be therefore 
concluded that these variables have minor or no influence on CBD pharmacokinetics.

The in-silico analysis suggests a strong inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 substrates of CBD across all age 
groups. This further supports the conduct of an in vivo study to quantify this interaction. A weak 
inhibition of CYP2C8 and UTG1A9, 2B7 is predicted, while the simulation model suggests other CYP 
mediated DDIs with CBD as perpetrator appears less likely. In vitro conducted studies are sufficient for 
its purpose. These suggest that clinically relevant DDIs between CBD and other drugs may be relevant 
for quite a variety enzymes and transporters involved. Important signals are potent inhibition of 
CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19 and 3A4. CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is discussed below in the in vivo section.  In 
vitro data suggests potential for DDIS between the major metabolite 7-COOH-CBD and BRCP, OAT3 
and OATP1B3. During the procedure, the Applicant indicated that a DDI study was planned to 
investigate the effects of CBD-OS on warfarin exposure, specifically examining the impact on exposure 
to S-warfarin and the CYP2C9 mediated metabolite S-7-hydroxywarfarin.  While these data are awaited 
it would be appropriate to have a note of caution in the SmPC section 4.5 for prescribers whose 
patients are receiving warfarin treatment. This proposal was supported by the CHMP. With respect to 
the major metabolite 7-COOH-CBD and interaction with BRCP, OAT3, and OATP1B3, a warning against 
a potential interaction between the metabolite 7-COOH-CBD and several transporters is included in the 
SmPC until more data is generated with the updated PBPK model.  
Studies conducted by the applicant do not suggest pharmacokinetic clinically important interactions 
between CBD and stiripentol or valproate. However, a bi-directional pharmacokinetic clinically 
important interaction with clobazam emerges, leading to an approximately 3 -fold increase in clobazam 
active metabolite N-CLB exposure and an increase in exposure of CBD active metabolite 7-OH-CBD.  
Both N-CLB and 7-OH-CBD have been demonstrated to have anticonvulsant properties in model 
systems. Concomitant use of Epidyolex and clobazam increases the incidence of somnolence and 
sedation. According to the applicant it is not possible to provide a rational clobazam dose reduction 
recommendation based upon population PK simulations since a PK model for CLB and N-CLB is not 
available. No increases were observed in CLB or N-CLB when CBD-OS was initiated in patients 
receiving concomitant treatment with stiripentol and clobazam. Furthermore, according to the 
Applicant the decision to reduce the CLB dose cannot be based solely on the known drug-to-drug 
interaction, which results in N-CLB exposure and an increase in 7-OH-CBD but with no meaningful 
increase to the parent compounds, CLB and CBD.  As per the SmPC the management of DDIs between 
CBD and CLB should be left to the treating physician, who is experienced in the treatment of epilepsy. 
This point should be included in the SmPC. Furthermore, the DDI potential of CBD includes other AEDs. 
CBD is proposed as add on adjunctive use with any appropriate antiepileptic drug therapy, and the 
treating physician should therefore have a very thorough knowledge of the pharmacology of CBD and 
other AEDs to be able to manage all potential DDIs. Therefore, for other AEDs commonly 
concomitantly administered with CBD-OS, the SmPC includes specific guidance in terms of relevant 
precautions and/or monitoring. 
A positive association between AUC exposure and elevated liver function test (> 2xULN), somnolence 
or loss of appetite was identified. The risk appears to increase disproportionally at levels about 50% 
higher than the median AUC values achieved at 20mg/kg/day. 
Logistic regression analysis suggests a positive exposure-response relationship at steady state in LGS 
patients. This is relevant to the posology related to food intake and the actual procedure used in 
clinical trials as concomitant administration of food substantially increases exposure to CBD and its 
main active metabolites. It should be noted, that the extent of concomitant food intake was not known 
in the population of LGS patients the Exposure-Response Analysis was based on.  
The applicant has conducted a lege artis QTc study. CBD at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses 
does not influence QTcF interval.

The applicant presented the results of a PK and PD study of CBD conducted in recreational drug users 
in order to investigate on the abuse potential of CBD. THC plasma concentrations were low during 
treatment with CBD (substantially lower than during treatment with cannabidiol), consistent with levels 
of the impurity in the CBD product. Some subjective drug effects were reported at the highest doses as 
compared to placebo, but these effects were significantly lower than reported for dronabinol and 
alprazolam (as positive controls) and less likely to be of clinical relevance. No effects on other 
subjective or objective psychomotor tests were noted. However, extrapolations to real-life settings 
should be made very cautiously. Keeping in mind notably lower drug exposure and positive results in 
several endpoints, the abuse potential cannot be excluded on the basis of data submitted. 
Consequently, the low abuse potential is reflected in SmPC section 5.1. 
CBD does not appear to affect sleeping quality in healthy adult volunteers.  
The applicant has addressed current known PD interactions in a separate section the SmPC. Herein, 
the observed effects on CNS and liver, e.g. somnolence and appetite loss are frequent AEs to both CBD 
and medicinal products often used concomitantly in the target population (clobazam, stiripentol and 
valproate), as well as an increase in liver parameters is common for CBD and valproate. These findings 
are appropriately reflected in SmPC section 4.8 and adequate warnings on increase of the hepatic 
transaminases and occurrence of somnolence and sedation are included in SmPC section 4.4.  
The mechanism of action for CBD is not fully elucidated. According to the presented data, CBD most 
likely modulates intracellular calcium, which in turn may confer reduced neuronal hyperexcitability. 
There are no studies on primary pharmacology in humans. In non-clinical data, different efficacy was 
observed in each type of convulsions. This phenomenon was also observed in clinical trials, where the 
effect of CBD differs in individual types of seizures (See the efficacy section of this report for further 
details). Specific warning on the potential for increased seizure frequency is included in SmPC section 
4.4.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP was of the view that the available information from scientific literature as well the PK data 
collected in the clinical trials were sufficient to support the application for Epidyolex for the treatment 
of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients from 
2 years of age and older from a clinical pharmacology perspective. In addition, the CHMP considered 
the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
In order to generate PK data in patients of < 2 years of age, the applicant should develop an updated 
PBPK model, and should also explore the development of a technique for direct sampling and analysis 
from patients in the below 2 years old age group, followed by implementation of sparse sampling 
approaches in appropriate clinical trials. 
A clinical drug-drug interaction study is being designed and is planned to be completed during 2019. 
The results will be provided post-authorisation. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Dose-ranging safety and PK study (GWEP1332A) 
Dose selection for the 4 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was based upon findings in a single 
randomized, placebo-controlled dose-ranging safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) trial of 5, 10, and 20 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS in children with DS (GWEP1332 Part A). This was a 3-week treatment period, 
multi-site, randomised, double-blind trial of GWP42003-P vs. placebo. Following a 4-week baseline 
period, eligible patients were randomised to 1 of 3 doses of CBD-OS or placebo at a 4:1 ratio. 
Assessments of safety and tolerability took place at 1, 2, and 3 weeks as well as following taper of 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) and 4 weeks after final dose. 
A total of 41 patients were screened, of which 34 patients were randomised into the trial: 27 to CBD-
OS (10, 8, and 9 to the 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day groups, respectively) and 7 to placebo. Patients had 
a documented history of Dravet syndrome (DS) with seizures not completely controlled by their current 
AEDs, and were taking at least 1 AED. All medications or interventions for epilepsy were stable for 4 
weeks prior to the trial and were to be maintained throughout the trial. Part A patients were aged 4–10 
years old (inclusive) with fewer than 4 convulsive seizures (i.e., tonic–clonic, tonic, clonic, atonic 
seizures) during the 4-week baseline period. 
Thirty-four patients were randomized to double-blind treatment. Thirty-two patients (94%) completed 
the treatment period of the trial; of these 29 (91%) completed the subsequent taper period.  
Since efficacy was not evaluated, Study GWEP1332A did not provide dose-response information. Thus, 
the minimally effective dose has not been determined in Dravet Syndrome, and no dose-response 
information was available for any indication before entering phase 3. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The clinical development program supporting the efficacy of CBD-OS comprises 2 randomised, placebo-
controlled trials in LGS; 1 investigating 10 and 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1414) and 1 investigating 
20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1423), and 2 randomised, placebo-controlled trials in DS; 1 investigating 
10 and 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1424) and 1 investigating 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1332

Part B). A total of 715 patients were randomised into the now completed pivotal trials, comprising 396 
patients with LGS (GWEP1414 and GWEP1423) and 319 patients with DS (GWEP1332 Part B). 
Dose selection for the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was based upon findings in a single 
randomised, placebo-controlled dose-ranging safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) trial of 5, 10, and 20 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS in children with DS (GWEP1332 Part A). Following assessment of the data from 
GWEP1332 Part A, an independent data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) approved 20 mg/kg/day 
as an appropriate dose of CBD-OS to use in all subsequent trials.

Subjects restarted titration from 2.5 mg/kg/d and titrated to target dose of 10-20 mg/kg/d over 2 weeks. Once in the maintenance phase, the PI 
could titrate up to a max of 30 mg/kg/d. 
Patients who completed one of the controlled trials were eligible to enter an open-label extension (OLE) 
trial (GWEP1415), for which the primary objective was monitoring long-term safety. Long-term 
exposure was also assessed within an EAP for patients with DREs including those with DS or LGS who 
were not candidates for the controlled trials. The EAP comprised a number of physician-initiated 
investigational new drug (IND) applications (including emergency INDs, individual INDs, and 
intermediate INDs), State-initiated IND applications in the US, and a Compassionate Access Scheme 
(CAS) in New South Wales, Australia. As of the data cut-off date (08 December 2016) the EAP had 
enrolled 684 patients, including 64 with DS (9.4%) and 97 with LGS (14.2%). 
Phase 1 and 2 clinical pharmacology trials were conducted in healthy subjects and specific populations 
to evaluate intrinsic and extrinsic factors which may affect the PK characteristics of CBD, as well as to 
evaluate drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with AEDs commonly used in LGS and DS.

Methods 
Study Participants  
In order to be eligible for the trials, patients had to be aged 2–55 years with a clinical diagnosis of 
LGS. Patients must have had at least 2 drop seizures each week during the first 28 days of the 
baseline period and have a history of slow (< 3.0 Hz) spike-and-wave pattern in an EEG prior to their 
enrolment into the baseline period. Patients must have been taking 1 or more AEDs at a dose which 
had been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and have documented failures on more than 1 
AED. All medications or interventions for epilepsy (including ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation 
[VNS]) must have been stable for 4 weeks prior to screening and the patient was willing to maintain a 
stable regimen throughout the trial. Patients and/or parent(s)/legal representative were willing and 
able to give informed consent, were willing to meet all trial requirements and had satisfactorily 
completed the IVRS telephone diary on at least 25 days of the baseline period. 
Patients were ineligible if they had used recreational or medicinal cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid-
based medications, within 3 months prior to screening and were to abstain from taking them during 
the trial. Patients were also ineligible if they had a history of alcohol or substance abuse, if they had 
known or suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of the investigational product, or if they did not 
meet laboratory and clinical health requirements at screening or baseline. 
Regions and sites: 
GWEP1414: 
A total of 293 patients were screened, 68 (23.2%) of which were screen failures. A total of 225 
patients were randomized to double-blind treatment. All randomized patients received at least 1 dose 
of double-blind IMP and thus were included in the safety analysis set. In total, 30 sites screened 
patients, of which 29 sites randomized patients into the trial (20 sites in the US, 5 in Spain, 1 in France 
and 3 in the UK). An additional 7 sites in the US were selected but did not screen patients. Of the 225 
randomized patients, 181 were randomized from the US, 32 from Spain, 11 from the UK and 1 from 
France.  
GWEP1423: 
A total of 200 patients were screened, 29 (14.5%) of which were screen failures. A total of 171 
patients were randomized to double-blind treatment. All randomized patients received at least 1 dose 
of double-blind IMP and thus were included in the safety analysis set. In total, 24 sites screened 
patients (17 in the US, 1 in the Netherlands and 6 in Poland), all of which randomized patients into the 
trial. An additional 11 sites were selected but did not screen patients (9 in the US and 2 in the 
Netherlands). Of the 171 randomized patients, 5 were randomized from the Netherlands, 38 from 
Poland, and 128 from the US. 
Treatments 
IMP was taken twice daily (morning and evening) without regard to meals, and could be taken with 
other concomitant medications.

CBD-OS was presented as an oral solution containing 100 mg/mL CBD in sesame oil with anhydrous 
ethanol (79 mg/ml), added sweetener (sucralose), and strawberry flavouring. Placebo was presented 
as an oral solution of sesame oil containing anhydrous ethanol, added sweetener (sucralose), and 
strawberry flavouring.  
Patients titrated CBD-OS to 10 mg/kg/day over 7 days or 20 mg/kg/day over 11 days and remained at 
this dose level for the duration of the treatment period. Following the end of treatment (or early 
withdrawal), all patients who did not immediately enter the OLE were to taper GWP42003-P over 10 
days (10% per day). However, the taper period could be interrupted if the patient wished to enter the 
OLE trial within a 7-day timeframe. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of CBD-OS as adjunctive treatment in reducing the 
number of drop seizures (per 28 days) when compared with placebo in patients with Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome (LGS). A drop seizure was defined as an attack or spell (atonic, tonic or tonic-clonic) 
involving the entire body, trunk or head that led or could have led to a fall, injury, slumping in a chair 
or hitting the patient’s head on a surface. 
The key efficacy secondary objectives were to assess the following in LGS patients taking CBD-OS as 
adjunctive treatment, when compared with placebo: 50% responder rate (in terms of ≥50% reduction 
in drop seizures); reduction in the number (per 28 days) of total seizures and changes from baseline in 
the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change (S/CGIC) score. 
Other secondary objectives are listed below: 
• 
• 
To assess the following in LGS patients taking CBD-OS as adjunctive treatment, when 
compared with placebo: number of episodes of status epilepticus (SE); need for hospitalization 
due to epilepsy; change in duration of subtypes of seizures; sleep disruption and daytime 
sleepiness; quality of life; adaptive behaviour; cognitive function; growth and development. 
To determine the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of cannabidiol (CBD) and its major metabolites 
following single and multiple doses of CBD-OS. 
To determine the effects of CBD-OS on plasma concentrations of concomitant antiepileptic drugs 
(AEDs), where available.  
Safety and tolerability of CBD-OS was assessed through monitoring of the following: adverse events 
(AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, injuries, suicidal ideation, abuse liability, cannabis 
withdrawal effects, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and menstruation cycles (in females). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Reduction in drop seizure frequency was the primary endpoint. During the screening visit investigators 
recorded a detailed clinical description of their patient's current seizures using a Seizure Identification 
Form (SIF) and by completing a list of seizures experienced by the patient in lay terms on the epilepsy 
diary reference sheet. Both were submitted to a committee of independent experts within 24 hours of 
the visit. Following review by an independent expert member of a committee the seizure classifications 
provided by the investigator were either confirmed, or a request for further information was sent back 
to the investigator. 
An IVRS was used throughout the baseline and treatment periods to record the number of each type of 
seizure experienced by the patient daily. Seizure data from withdrawn patients were included only up 
Assessment report

Page 82/190 
 
until  the  time  they  discontinued  the  treatment  period.  For  the  majority  of  patients  all  assessments, 
including daily seizure recording, were completed on their behalf by caregivers. Seizures were recorded 
daily  on  a  validated  electronic  patient  reported  outcomes  (ePRO)  using  the  IVRS.  Sites  had  been 
trained  on  the  use  of  this  system,  both  by  the  vendor  and  by  the  sponsor,  and  conducted  a  diary 
demonstration with the caregiver during the first trial visit. At the screening visit, the training consisted 
in  confirmation  and  discussion  of  the  different  known  seizure  presentations  of  each  patient.  The  LGS 
ePRO consisted of a maximum of 14 questions; the first to ask if the patient had any seizures. If the 
answer was yes, questions were asked on how many seizures were observed for each of the following 
types: (1) atonic; (2) tonic; (3) tonic-clonic; (4) myoclonic; (5) clonic; (6) countable partial; (7) other 
partial;  (8)  absence;  (9)  convulsive  seizures  >  30  minutes;  and  (10)  non-convulsive  seizures  >  30 
minutes.  Following  the  questions  relating  atonic,  tonic  and  tonic-clonic  seizures  the  LGS  ePRO  also 
asked:  (1)  how  many  tonic  seizures  were  drop  seizures;  (2)  how  many  atonic  seizures  were  drop 
seizures;  and  (3)  how  many  tonic–clonic  seizures  were  drop  seizures.  Only  yes/no  answers  and 
numerical answers, using the telephone keypad, were recorded. The average call duration was around 
3.5 minutes. 
The ePRO calls could be made in local language and had to be made daily between 6 PM and midnight 
local time; they were to be reflective of the number of seizures since the last call on the previous day 
or the last 24 hours if no call was made. If a call was missed, there was an opportunity to enter data 
for the previous day only. 
The primary efficacy outcome variable was the percentage change from baseline in number of drop 
seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period of the study (Day 1 to the end of the 
evaluable period) in patients taking GWP42003-P compared with placebo. 
Key secondary efficacy variables were as follows (testing order): 
1.  Number of patients considered treatment responders, defined as those with a ≥ 50% reduction 
in drop seizures from baseline. 
2.  Percentage change from baseline in number of total seizures (average per 28 days). 
3.  Changes from baseline in the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change (S/CGIC) score. 
The other secondary efficacy variables were as follows: 
• 
Percentage change from baseline in number of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the 
Weeks 1–4, 5–8 and 9–12 of the maintenance period. 
•  Number of patients considered treatment responders, defined as those with a ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, 
≥ 75%, or 100% reduction in drop seizures from baseline (overall and 4-weekly). 
•  Number of patients experiencing a >25% worsening, ≤−25 to ≥ 0% no change, >0% to 
<+25% no change, ≥25 to <50% improvement, ≥50 to <75% improvement or ≥75% 
improvement in drop seizures from baseline. 
• 
Percentage change from baseline in frequencies (average per 28 days) of non-drop seizures, 
convulsive seizures, non-convulsive seizures and subtypes of seizures. 
•  Changes from baseline in duration of seizure subtypes (as assessed by the Subject/Caregiver 
•  Global Impression of Change in Seizure Duration [S/CGICSD]), number of episodes of SE, 
number of inpatient hospitalizations due to epilepsy, quality of life as assessed by the Quality 
of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE; for patients aged 2–18 years) or Quality of Life in 
Epilepsy, version 2 (QOLIE-31-P; for patients aged 19 years and older) score, Vineland 
Adaptive Behaviour Scales Second Edition (Vineland-II) score, Cognitive Assessment Battery

score, Sleep Disruption 0–10 Numerical Rating Scale (0–10 NRS) score, and Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score. 
The exploratory efficacy variables were time to baseline drop seizure frequency and number of drop 
seizure-free days. 
Sample size 
The planned number of randomized patients for trial GWEP1414 was 150 (50 per CBD-OS treatment 
group and 25 per placebo treatment group, which subsequently became 1 pooled placebo group). The 
planned number of randomized patients for trial GWEP1423 was 100 (50 per treatment group). It was 
assumed that patients in the placebo group would experience a mean reduction in drop seizure 
frequency of 18% (from baseline); the sample size of 50 patients per treatment group would then be 
sufficient to detect a difference of 32% between treatments (i.e., patients receiving CBD-OS would 
experience at least a 50% reduction in drop seizures). This was based on a standard deviation (SD) of 
56%, using a 2-tailed 5% significance level and 80% power. 
Randomisation 
A unique patient number was assigned to each patient at Visit 1, using the IWRS. At Visit 2 the IWRS 
was used to randomly allocate patients who met all eligibility criteria following the baseline period to 
either CBD-OS or placebo; both were provided in identical 100 mL amber glass bottles with unique 
identification numbers. 
In trial GWEP1423 patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (CBD-OS 20 mg/kg/day or 
placebo) at a 1:1 ratio. In trial GWEP1414, patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (CBD-
OS 20 mg/kg/day, CBD-OS 10 mg/kg/day, placebo 20 mg/kg/day dose volume equivalent, or placebo 
10 mg/kg/day dose volume equivalent) at a 2:2:1:1 ratio; patients in the placebo groups were pooled 
for the analyses of efficacy and safety.  
The randomization scheme for each trial was generated by an independent statistician using random 
permuted blocks and was stratified by age group as follows: 2 to < 6, 6 to < 12, 12 to < 18, and 18 to 
< 56 years. 
Blinding (masking) 
All pivotal trials were double-blind. All IMP, i.e., CBD-OS or placebo, was provided in identical 100 ml 
amber glass bottles. IMP was presented as an oral solution containing 100 mg/ml CBD in the excipients 
sesame oil and anhydrous ethanol (79 mg/ml) with added sweetener (sucralose) and strawberry 
flavouring; the matched placebo comprised only the excipients. 
Statistical methods 
Primary efficacy outcome variable: 
The primary efficacy outcome variable was the percentage change from baseline in drop seizure 
frequency (average per 28 days) during the treatment period, based on the ITT analysis set. The data 
were analysed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. An estimate of the median difference between CBD and 
placebo, together with approximate 95% CI, was calculated using the Hodges-Lehmann approach. 
Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effect of the assumptions of the primary 
endpoint:

1.  Wilcoxon rank-sum test on percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency during 
the maintenance period  
2.  Wilcoxon rank-sum test on percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency during 
the treatment period using the PP analysis set. 
3.  A rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on percentage change from baseline in drop seizure 
frequency during the treatment period. 
4.  ANCOVA of log transformed drop seizure frequency during the treatment period. 
5.  ANCOVA on percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency during the treatment 
period including baseline and age group as covariates and treatment group as a fixed factor.  
6.  Wilcoxon rank-sum test on percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency during 
each 4 weeks of the maintenance period (Week 1 to 4, Week 5 to 8 and Week 9 to 12 of the 
12-week maintenance period). 
7.  Wilcoxon rank-sum test on percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency during 
the treatment period, using the worst case of last observation carried forward (LOCF), next 
observation carried backward (NOCB) and the mean from the non-missing data for each 
patient to impute missing data arising from unreported days in IVRS during the treatment 
period only (not the baseline period). Any intermittent missing data for the number of drop 
seizures arising from unreported days in IVRS will be imputed using the worst (highest number 
of seizures) of the following for each patient: LOCF, NOCB and the mean daily number of 
seizures during the treatment period based on using non-missing data. 
8.  Wilcoxon rank-sum test on percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency during 
the treatment period, using multiple imputation (MI) to impute data under the Missing Not at 
Random (MNAR) assumption 
9.  Only for Study GWEP1423: Wilcoxon rank-sum test on percentage change from baseline in 
drop seizure frequency during the treatment period using patients from ITT analysis set but 
analysed by actual treatment received rather than treatment randomized. This analysis was 
only to be performed if 2 patients were randomised to different treatment groups e.g. if a 
patient randomized to placebo received GWP42003-P and a patient randomised to GWP42003-
P received placebo. 
Key secondary efficacy outcome variable:  
1. Drop Seizure Treatment Responders (≥ 50% Reduction in Drop Seizure Frequency): 
The proportion of patients considered treatment responders, defined as those with a ≥50% reduction 
in drop seizure frequency from baseline, during the treatment period, was summarized by treatment 
group and analysed using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by age group. The analysis 
was performed on the ITT analysis set and repeated on the PP analysis set. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed on the ITT analysis set, repeating the above analysis, using data for the maintenance period 
only, and during each 4 weeks of the maintenance period (Week 1 to 4, Week 5 to 8 and Week 9 to 12 
of the 12-week maintenance period). There was no imputation for missing IVRS days or withdrawals. 
In addition at the CHMP request, applicant provided additional sensitivity analyses considering (1) 
patients with unreported days in the IVRS and patients that withdraw from the study considered as 
non-responders and (2) patients with unreported days in the IVRS considered as non-responders if the 
average of their observed seizures was above 50 % and patients who withdraw from the study 
considered non-responders. 
2. Total Seizures: 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 85/190 
 
The analysis was performed on the ITT analysis set and repeated on the PP analysis set. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed on the ITT analysis set, repeating the above analysis, using data for only the 
maintenance period, and during each 4 weeks of the maintenance period (Week 1 to 4, Week 5 to 8 
and Week 9 to 12 of the 12-week maintenance period). There was no imputation for missing IVRS 
days or withdrawals In addition at the CHMP request, applicant provided additional sensitivity analyses 
to account for missing data by (1) presenting a 'worst case' sensitivity analysis (similar to sensitivity 
analysis 7 for the primary endpoint) and (2) investigating whether a negative binomial model 
incorporating the actual observational time could be applied considering different strategies to handle 
missing unreported days before the dropout date. 
3, Change from baseline in the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change (S/CGIC) score: 
It was anticipated that only a small percentage of patients would complete the subject version of the 
questionnaire. Hence, a combined score was used defined as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
If both a CGIC and SGIC are completed then the CGIC will be used. 
If only a CGIC is completed then the CGIC will be used. 
If only a SGIC is completed then the SGIC will be used. 
The scores at the end of treatment visit and last visit (if different from the end of treatment) were 
analysed using ordinal logistic regression. Proportional odds modelling was carried out by including 
treatment group as a factor. The estimated odds ratio (CBD-OS vs. placebo), 95% CI for the odds 
ratio, and the p-value testing the null hypothesis that the odds ratio is equal to 1, were presented. The 
analysis performed at the last visit was considered the main analysis with the analysis at the end of 
treatment being considered a sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis was also performed using only 
the CGIC score. 
The key secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically to control the type I error. 
Other secondary endpoints: 
For some of the secondary endpoints e.g. the Epworth Daytime Sleepiness scale and the Quality of Life 
scales, if fewer than 50% of the items were missing, the missing items were imputed as the mean of 
the remaining non-missing scores. If more than 50% were missing, the total score would be missing. 
For the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy, “not applicable” responses were treated as missing 
values. However, imputation of one item as a mean of other items may not be appropriate since items 
may measure different domains. 
Results study GWEP1414 
Participant flow 
A total of 293 patients were screened, 68 (23.2%) of which were screen failures. A total of 225 
patients were randomized to double-blind treatment. All randomized patients received at least 1 dose 
of double-blind IMP and thus were included in the safety analysis set. In total, 30 sites screened 
patients, of which 29 sites randomized patients into the trial (20 sites in the US, 5 in Spain, 1 in France 
and 3 in the UK). An additional 7 sites in the US were selected but did not screen patients. Of the 225 
randomized patients, 181 were randomized from the US, 32 from Spain, 11 from the UK and 1 from 
France.

Recruitment 
A total of 293 patients were screened, 68 (23.2%) of which were screen failures. A total of 225 
patients were randomized to double-blind treatment (Figure 15). The number of recruited patients 
exceeded the planned number according to sample size estimations.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations: 
During blinded review, a number of patients were deemed to have important protocol deviations with 
the potential to compromise the assessment of efficacy.  In total, 24 patients were excluded from the 
PP  analysis  set;  10  patients  (13.7%)  randomized  to  10  mg/kg/day  CBD-OS,  11  patients  (14.5%) 
randomized  to  20  mg/kg/day  CBD-OS,  3  patients  (3.9%)  randomized  to  placebo.  Of  the  24  patients 
excluded from the PP analysis set, 11 patients (8 randomized to 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 2 randomized 
to 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, and 1 randomized to placebo) were excluded due to protocol deviations; the 
remaining 13 patients that were excluded from the PP analysis set were patients that withdrew during 
the treatment period and were not exclusions due to protocol deviations. 
Among  protocol  deviations  not  leading  to  exclusion  from  the  PP  analysis  set  were  e.g.  one  10 
mg/kg/day patient missing IMP doses for 10 days, and three 10 mg/kg/day patients receiving halved

Page 87/190 
 
 
 
doses for 43 days. These three patients were retained in the PP analysis since dosing with study drug 
was continued throughout the trial. 
Protocol amendments: 
There were 7 protocol amendments of which 5 were before the date of first informed consent (8 June 
2015), and the remaining 2 a few days after (11 June and 15 June, respectively). Thus, it is considered 
likely that all amendments came into effect before patients were included in the study. 
Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the treatment groups with only minor imbalances 
e.g. regarding the frequency of certain seizure types (atonic and myoclonic seizures). There were more 
patients with autism spectrum disorders in the 20 mg/kg/day arm than in the two other treatment 
arms. All patients had failed 2 or more AEDs prior to starting the trial. Only 4 patients were reported to 
have previously used cannabis.

Numbers analysed 
All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of IMP and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy 
endpoint were included in the ITT analysis set according to their randomized treatment group 
The primary efficacy analyses were conducted using the ITT analysis set, which comprised a total of 
225 patients: 73 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 76 patients in the 20 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P group and 76 patients in the placebo group. 
Additional analyses were conducted using the PP analysis set, which excluded 24 patients (10 patients 
in the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 11 patients in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, and 3 
patients in the placebo group), comprising 13 patients who withdrew from the trial early and a further 
11 patients with major protocol deviations. Accordingly, the PP analysis set comprised a total of 201 
patients: 63 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 65 patients in the 20 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P group, and 73 patients in the placebo group. 
The safety analysis set comprised all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of IMP; no 
patients were excluded from the safety analysis set. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable: 
During the baseline period, the median drop seizure frequency (28-day average) was slightly lower in 
the placebo group than in the active treatment groups. A greater median reduction in drop seizure 
frequency during the treatment period was seen in both CBD-OS groups (20 mg/kg/day and 10 
mg/kg/day), compared with the placebo group; the difference between each CBD-OS group and 
placebo was statistically significant (p=0.0047 and p=0.0016, respectively).

Sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy variable using the PP analysis set and during the 
maintenance period (and during each 4 weeks thereof) using the ITT analysis set were consistent with 
the result obtained for the primary analysis: 
In the PP analysis set, the median percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency during 
the treatment period was −45.79 in the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, and −36.44 in the 10 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, compared with −17.25 in the placebo group (estimated median difference 
20 mg/kg/day: −26.28; 95% CI: −40.08, −10.70; estimated median difference 10 mg/kg/day: 
−17.88; 95% CI: −30.35, −5.66); the difference in favour of both 20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS over placebo was statistically significant (p=0.0009 and p=0.0054, respectively). 
In the ITT analysis set, the median percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency during 
the whole maintenance period was −47.15 in the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, and −39.99 in the 10 
mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, compared with −18.73 in the placebo group; the difference in favour 
of both 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS and 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS over placebo was statistically significant 
(p=0.0067 and p=0.0033, respectively). The median percentage reduction from baseline in drop 
seizure frequency was also greater in both CBD-OS treatment groups compared with placebo for each 
of the consecutive 4-week periods of the maintenance period; in all cases the treatment difference in 
favour of CBD-OS was statistically significant with the exception of 20 mg/kg/day during the last 4-
week period of the maintenance period (Week 9–12). 
Sensitivity analyses of imputing missing data from unreported days in the IVRS (using the worst case 
of LOCF, NOCB, or the mean daily number of seizures during the treatment period, based on non-
missing data) and of MNAR using a model with MI determined that the primary analysis is robust 
against missing data, and that the assumption of data missing not at random does not alter the result 
of the primary analysis.  
Patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in Drop Seizure Frequency from Baseline: 
The proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in drop seizure frequency from baseline was 
calculated for the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS and placebo groups during the entire treatment period and 
during the maintenance period. Results are presented as OR (20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS:Placebo) along 
with 95% CI, where values >1 are in favour of CBD-OS. Statistical significance was determined using a 
CMH test stratified by age group. During the treatment period, the proportion of patients with a 
reduction of 50% or more in their baseline drop seizure frequency (28-day average) was greater in the 
20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups, compared with the placebo group. The difference in 
favour of CBD-OS was statistically significant for both the 20 mg/kg/day group (p=0.0006) and the 10

Change from Baseline in Total Seizure Frequency: 
A greater median reduction in total seizure frequency (28-day average) during the treatment period 
was seen in both the 20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups, compared with the placebo 
group. The difference between each CBD-OS group and placebo was statistically significant (p=0.0091 
and p=0.0015, respectively). Analysis of the median percentage change in total seizure frequency 
during the treatment period, for the PP analysis set, also showed a statistically significant difference in 
favour of each of the CBD-OS groups. Results of sensitivity analyses were concordant with those of the 
primary analysis.

The change from baseline in overall condition, assessed using the S/CGIC, was reported for each 
treatment group during the treatment period and was the final key secondary endpoint tested using 
the ITT analysis set. When measured on a numerical scale, a lower score represents an improvement 
in condition. At their last visit (i.e., incorporating LOCF, the last visit at which the S/CGIC assessment 
was conducted for an individual patient) higher proportions of 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS patients, and 10 
mg/kg/day patients, than placebo patients were reported as having an improvement in overall 
condition (slightly improved, much improved, or very much improved) compared to their status before 
the trial; 57.3% (43/75) and 65.8% (48/73) vs. 44.0% (33/75), respectively. Only 1 placebo patient 
(1.3%) was reported as ‘very much improved’ compared with 6 patients (8.0%) in the 20 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS group and 9 patients (12.3%) in the 10 mg/kg/day group. The treatment differences in favour 
of 20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS were both statistically significant (p=0.0439 and 
p=0.0020, respectively). Sensitivity analyses using just the caregiver scores, and/or the PP analysis 
set also showed statistically significant improvements in favour of both doses of CBD-OS.

Other secondary efficacy variables: 
For all seizure types, findings were in line with the primary analysis: Greater median reductions from 
baseline were seen in the 20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups than in the placebo 
groups.

However, 3 patients with seizures of a new type recurring more than twice were in the active (10 
mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day) groups. Also, non-convulsive SE was seen in 4 patients that did not 
report non-convulsive SE during the baseline period. 
Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (2–18 Years) scores should be interpreted with caution due to the 
very low number of patients included in these analyses. The scores improved more in the placebo 
group than in the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, and the difference was statistically significant for the 
attention/concentration subscale. Other areas where placebo appeared numerically superior were 
anxiety, behavioural difficulties, memory, and other cognitive skills. Executive functioning improved in 
the placebo group, worsened in the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group and was unchanged in the 10 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS group. The index of 'internalizing behaviours showed worsening in 20 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS patients, but an improvement in 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P and placebo patients. The index 
of ‘behavioural symptoms’ showed an improvement in the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, a slight 
worsening in the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group and no change in the placebo group. The index of 
adaptive skills showed worsening in both CBD-OS groups and improved in the placebo group. Thus, 
negative effects of CBD-OS, in particular the 20 mg/kg/day dose, on cognition and behaviour cannot 
be excluded. 
Drop Seizure Free Days: 
The mean number of drop seizure free days (28-day average) was similar between the 3 treatment 
groups during the baseline period (range 4.57–5.29). It increased in all treatment groups during the 
treatment period and the maintenance period, although greater increases were seen in the 20 
mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups compared with placebo. Analysis showed that the 
treatment difference in favour of 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS was statistically significant for both the 
treatment period (p<0.0001; treatment difference: 4.64; 95% CI: 2.46, 6.81) and the maintenance 
period (p<0.0001; treatment difference: 4.84; 95% CI: 2.54, 7.13); equivalent to approximately 5 
extra drop seizure free days (per 28 days). Similarly, analysis showed that the treatment difference in 
favour of 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS was statistically significant for both the treatment period (p=0.0030; 
treatment difference: 3.34; 95% CI: 1.15, 5.53) and the maintenance period (p=0.0024; treatment

difference: 3.61; 95% CI: 1.29, 5.93); equivalent to approximately 3–4 days extra drop seizure free

Results GWEP1423 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  200  patients  were  screened,  29  (14.5%)  of  which  were  screen  failures.  A  total  of  171 
patients were randomized to double-blind treatment. All randomized patients received at least 1 dose 
of  double-blind  IMP  and  thus  were  included  in  the  safety  analysis  set.  In  total,  24  sites  screened 
patients (17 in the US, 1 in the Netherlands and 6 in Poland), all of which randomized patients into the 
trial.  An  additional  11  sites  were  selected  but  did  not  screen  patients  (9  in  the  US  and  2  in  the 
Netherlands).  Of  the  171  randomized  patients,  5  were  randomized  from  the  Netherlands,  38  from 
Poland, and 128 from the US.

a5 GWP42003-P entered taper following withdrawal; the remaining patients who withdrew did not. 
b3 patients met liver function withdrawal criteria and in all cases had TEAEs relating to liver transaminase elevations that were reported to have 
led to withdrawal (see Section 9.3.1.3). 
Of the 171 patients that were randomized in the trial (86 CBD-OS patients and 85 placebo patients), 
156  patients  (91.2%)  completed  the  treatment  period  (72  CBD-OS  patients  [83.7%]  and  84  placebo 
patients  [98.8%]).  Fifteen  patients  (8.8%)  were  withdrawn  during  the  treatment  period  (14  CBD-OS 
patients [16.3%] and 1 placebo patient [1.2%]).

Recruitment 
A total of 200 patients were screened, 29 (14.5%) of which were screen failures. A total of 171 
patients were randomized to double-blind treatment. The number of recruited patients exceeded the 
planned number according to sample size estimations.  Additionally, many patients were recruited after 
protocol amendment 4 which included an increased number of participants based on a revised estimate 
of the placebo response (from 10% to 18%).  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations: 
During blinded review, it was determined that only the 15 patients who withdrew during the treatment 
period (14 GWP42003-P patients and 1 placebo patient) were to be excluded from the PP analysis set. 
All  protocol  deviations  reported  in  the  patients  who  completed  the  trial  were  regarded  as  either 
important  or  minor,  but  would  not  compromise  the  assessment  of  efficacy  and  therefore  would  not 
warrant removal from the PP analysis set. 
Protocol amendments:  
Amendments 3 and 4 were performed while recruitment was ongoing. The changes included an 
increase in patient numbers and changes in eligibility criteria in particular regarding IVRS compliance. 
Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across treatment groups with only minor imbalances.

Numbers analysed 
All patients who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of IMP, and had at least 1 post-baseline 
efficacy endpoint were included in the ITT analysis set according to their randomized treatment group. 
The primary efficacy analyses were conducted using the ITT analysis set, which comprised a total of 
171 patients: 86 patients in the GWP42003-P group and 85 patients in the placebo group 
Additional analyses were conducted using the PP analysis set, which excluded 15 patients (14 
GWP42003-P patients and 1 placebo patient) who withdrew during the treatment period. The PP 
analysis set comprised a total of 156 patients: 72 patients in the GWP42003-P group and 84 patients 
in the placebo group. No other major deviations were identified (see Section 7.2). 
The safety analysis set comprised all patients who received at least 1 dose of IMP; no patients were 
excluded from the safety analysis set. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable: 
During the baseline period, the median drop seizure frequency (28-day average) was similar for both 
treatment  groups.  A  greater  median  reduction  was  seen  in  the  CBD-OS  group,  and  the  difference 
between treatment groups was statistically significant (p=0.0135).

Sensitivity  analyses  for  the  primary  efficacy  variable  using  the  PP  analysis  set  and  during  the 
maintenance period (and during each 4 weeks thereof) using the ITT analysis set were consistent with 
the result obtained for the primary analysis. In the PP population, the median percentage change from 
baseline  in  drop  seizure  frequency  during  the  treatment  period  was  −46.12  in  the  CBD-OS  group 
compared with −21.73 in the placebo group (estimated median difference: −19.43; 95% CI: −32.79, 
−5.76); the difference in favour of CBD-OS was statistically significant (p=0.0062). In the ITT analysis 
set,  the  median  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  drop  seizure  frequency  during  the  whole 
maintenance period was −48.77 in the CBD-OS group compared with −20.45 in the placebo group; the 
difference  between  treatment  groups  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of  CBD-OS  over  placebo 
(p=0.0096).  The  median  percentage  reduction  from  baseline  in  drop  seizure  frequency  was  also 
greater in the CBD-OS group compared with placebo for each of the consecutive 4-week periods of the 
maintenance  period;  in  all  cases  the  treatment  difference  in  favour  of  CBD-OS  was  statistically 
significant. 
Sensitivity analyses of imputing missing data from unreported days in the IVRS (using the worst case 
of  LOCF,  NOCB,  or  the  mean  daily  number  of  seizures  during  the  treatment  period,  based  on  non-
missing  data)  and  of  MNAR  using  a  model  with  MI  determined  that  the  primary  analysis  is  robust 
against missing data, and that the assumption of data MNAR does not alter the result of the primary 
analysis. 
Patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in Drop Seizure Frequency from Baseline: 
Results are presented as OR (CBD-OS:Placebo) along with 95% CI for the OR, where values > 1 are in 
favour  of  CBD-OS.  Statistical  significance  was  determined  using  a  CMH  test  stratified  by  age  group. 
During  the  treatment  period,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  reduction  of  half  or  more  in  their 
baseline  drop  seizure  frequency  (28-day  average)  was  greater  in  the  CBD-OS  group  than  in  the 
placebo group. There were approximately 2.6-times the odds of achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in drop 
seizure  frequency  in  the  CBD-OS  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group;  the  difference  was 
statistically significant (p=0.0043).

Change from Baseline in Total Seizure Frequency: 
A  greater  median  reduction  in  total  seizure  frequency  (28-day  average)  during  the  treatment  period 
was  seen  in  the  CBD-OS  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group;  the  difference  between  treatment

At  their  last  visit  (i.e.,  incorporating  LOCF,  the  last  visit  at  which  the  S/CGIC  assessment  was 
conducted for an individual patient) a higher proportion of CBD-OS patients than placebo patients were 
reported  as  having  an  improvement  in  overall  condition  (slightly  improved,  much  improved,  or  very 
much improved) compared to their status before the trial; 58.3% (49/84 patients) vs. 34.1% (29/85 
patients), respectively. Thrice as many CBD-OS patients than placebo patients were reported as ‘very 
much improved’ (15 patients [17.9%] vs. 5 patients [5.9%], respectively). There were approximately 
2.5-times the odds of patients recording a lower score (improvement) in overall condition in the CBD-
OS  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  last  visit  (OR:  2.54;  95%  CI:  1.45,  4.47)  and  the 
difference  was  statistically  significant  (p=0.0012);  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  favour  of 
CBD-OS was also observed at the end of treatment (p=0.0021; OR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.33).  
Main studies, Dravet Syndrome (Studies GWEP1332B and GWEP1424) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Study participants: 
GWEP1332B 
Patients had to be aged 2-18 years (inclusive) with a clinical diagnosis of DS and current seizure types 
confirmed  by  a  committee  of  independent  experts  and  to  have  experienced  4  or  more  convulsive 
seizures during the 4-week baseline period. A convulsive seizure was defined as a tonic, clonic, tonic-
clonic, or atonic seizure. Patients were taking 1 or more AEDs at a dose which had been stable for at 
Assessment report

least  4  weeks.  All  medications  or  interventions  for  epilepsy  (including  ketogenic  diet  and  VNS)  were 
stable  for  4  weeks  prior  to  screening  and  patient  and  caregiver  were  willing  to  maintain  a  stable 
regimen throughout the trial. The ketogenic diet and VNS treatments were not counted as an AED. 
Patients were ineligible if they had used recreational or medicinal cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid-
based medications, within 3 months prior to screening and were to abstain from taking them during 
the trial. Patients were also ineligible if they had a history of alcohol or substance abuse, if they had 
known or suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of the investigational product, or if they did not 
meet laboratory and clinical health requirements at screening or baseline. 
GWEP1424 
Eligibility criteria were comparable to those of study 1332B with only minor differences e.g. marginally 
stricter criteria for liver enzyme abnormalities at study entry. 
Regions and sites: 
GWEP1332B 
A total of 177 patients were screened for Part B of this trial, 57 of which were screen failures. The main 
reasons for screen failure were that inclusion criteria were not met (46%) and 'other reasons' (42%). A 
total of  120  patients  were  randomized  to  double-blind  treatment.  All  randomized  patients  received  at 
least 1 dose of double-blind IMP and thus were included in the safety analysis set. Part B of this trial 
was  conducted  at  23  trial  sites;  2  in  Poland,  4  in  France,  3  in  the  UK  and  14  in  the  US.  All  sites 
screened  patients  and  22  sites  (2  in  Poland,  4  in  France,  3  in  the  UK  and  13  in  the  US)  randomized 
patients  into  the  trial.  Of  the  120  randomized  patients,  14  were  randomized  from  Poland,  18  from 
France, 16 from the UK and 72 from the US. 
GWEP1424 
In total, 43 sites screened patients (26 in the US, 7 in Spain, 5 in  Poland, 2 in the Netherlands, 2 in 
Australia, and 1 in Israel) of which 38 sites randomised patients into the trial. Of the 199 randomised 
patients,  94  were  randomised  in  the  US,  39  in  Spain,  25  in  Poland,  25  in  the  Netherlands,  13  in 
Australia, and 3 in Israel.  
Treatments 
IMP  was  taken  twice  daily  (morning  and  evening)  without  regard  to  meals,  and  could  be  taken  with 
other concomitant medications. 
CBD-OS  was  presented  as  an  oral  solution  containing  100  mg/mL  CBD  in  sesame  oil  with  anhydrous 
ethanol  (79  mg/ml),  added  sweetener  (sucralose),  and  strawberry  flavouring.  Placebo  was  presented 
as  an  oral  solution  of  sesame  oil  containing  anhydrous  ethanol  (79  mg/ml),  added  sweetener 
(sucralose), and strawberry flavouring. 
Patients titrated CBD-OS to 10 mg/kg/day over 7 days or 20 mg/kg/day over 11 days and remained at 
this  dose  level  for  the  duration  of  the  treatment  period.  Following  the  end  of  treatment  (or  early 
withdrawal),  all  patients  who  did  not  immediately  enter  the  OLE  were  to  taper  CBD-OS  over  10  days 
(10% per day). However, the taper period could be interrupted if the patient wished to enter the OLE 
trial within a 7-day timeframe.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  CBD-OS  as  an  adjunctive  antiepileptic  treatment 
compared  with  placebo,  with  respect  to  the  percentage  change  from  baseline  during  the  treatment 
period of the study in convulsive seizure frequency.  
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
To  assess  changes  from  baseline  in  convulsive,  total,  and  non-convulsive  seizure  frequency, 
duration  of  seizures,  usage  of  rescue  medication,  number  of  inpatient  hospitalisations  due  to 
epilepsy, sleep disruption, daytime sleepiness, quality of life, menstruation cycles (in females), 
growth  and  development,  and  conduct  behavioural  assessments  in  patient  taking  CBD-OS  as 
an adjunctive treatment, when compared with placebo. 
To  determine  effects  of  CBD-OS  on  plasma  concentrations  of  concomitant  AEDs,  where 
available. 
To assess the safety of CBD-OS when compared with placebo. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  total  convulsive  seizure  frequency 
during the treatment period of the study in patients taking CBD-OS compared with placebo. 
GWEP1332B 
The key secondary endpoint was the number of patients considered treatment responders, defined as 
those  with  a  ≥50%  reduction  in  convulsive  seizures  from  baseline.  The  key  secondary  endpoint  was 
tested hierarchically to control the type I error. 
GWEP1424 
The key secondary endpoints were 
1) Change in total seizure frequency 
2)  Number  of  patients  considered  treatment  responders,  defined  as  those  with  a  ≥50%  reduction  in 
convulsive seizures from baseline 
3) CGIC score 
The key secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically to control the type I error. 
Sample size 
Study GWEP1424 
The planned number of randomized patients for trial GWEP1424 was 186 (62 per CBD-OS treatment 
group and 31 per placebo treatment group, which subsequently became 1 pooled placebo group). For a 
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test comparing 2 distributions with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, a 
sample size of 62 per group (after pooling the placebo groups) was required to obtain a power of at 
least 80%. This was based on a gamma distribution for the GWP42003-P groups with scale parameter 
of 65.614 and shape parameter of 1.0886, and a gamma distribution for the placebo group with scale 
parameter of 40.887 and shape parameter of 2.3059.  
Study GWEP1332B 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 100/190 
 
The planned number of randomized patients for trial GWEP1332B was 100 (50 per treatment group). It 
was assumed that patients in the placebo group would experience a mean reduction in convulsive 
seizure frequency of 18% (from baseline), meaning the sample size of 50 patients per group would be 
sufficient to detect a difference of 32% between treatments (i.e., patients receiving GWP42003-P 
would experience at least a 50% reduction in convulsive seizures). This was based on a standard 
deviation of 56%, using a 2-sided 5% significance level and 80% power. 
Randomisation 
A unique patient number was assigned to each patient at Visit 1, using the IWRS. At Visit 2 the IWRS 
was used to randomly allocate patients who met all eligibility criteria following the baseline period to 
either CBD-OS or placebo; both were provided in identical 100 mL amber glass bottles with unique 
identification numbers. 
In trial GWEP1332B, patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (CBD-OS 20 mg/kg/day or 
placebo) at a 1:1 ratio. In trial GWEP1424, patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (CBD-
OS 20 mg/kg/day, CBD-OS 10 mg/kg/day, placebo 20 mg/kg/day dose volume equivalent, or placebo 
10 mg/kg/day dose volume equivalent) at a 2:2:1:1 ratio; patients in the placebo groups were pooled 
for the analyses of efficacy and safety. 
The randomization scheme for each trial was generated by an independent statistician using random 
permuted blocks and was stratified by age group as follows: 2 to < 6, 6 to < 13, and 13 to < 19 years. 
Blinding (masking) 
All pivotal trials were double-blind. All IMP, i.e., CBD-OS or placebo, was provided in identical 100 ml 
amber glass bottles. IMP was presented as an oral solution containing 100 mg/ml CBD in the excipients 
sesame oil and anhydrous ethanol (79 mg/ml) with added sweetener (sucralose) and strawberry 
flavouring; the matched placebo comprised only the excipients. 
Statistical methods 
GWEP1332B 
Primary efficacy outcome variable: 
Primary null hypothesis: Following 14 weeks of treatment there is no difference in effect between the 
CBD-OS  treatment  group  and  the  placebo  treatment  group  in  terms  of  the  percentage  change  from 
baseline in convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period.  
The  null  hypothesis  is  rejected  if  there  is  statistical  evidence  of  a  difference  between  the  treatment 
groups at the α-level of 0.05 for the primary endpoint. 
Percentage change from baseline is calculated as: 
((Frequency during the treatment period – Frequency during baseline) ÷ Frequency during baseline) × 
100 
The frequency during each period will be based on 28-day averages and calculated as: 
(Number of seizures in the period ÷ Number of reported days in IVRS in the period) × 28 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 101/190 
 
The  data  is  analysed  using  a  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test.  An  estimate  of  the  median  difference  between 
CBD-OS and placebo, together with approximate 95% confidence interval (CI), are calculated using the 
Hodges-Lehmann approach. 
The following sensitivity analyses were planned for the primary endpoint: 
1.  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  on  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  convulsive  seizure  frequency 
during the treatment period using the PP analysis set. 
2.  A  rank  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  on  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  convulsive 
seizure frequency during the treatment period. 
3.  ANCOVA of log transformed convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period. 
4.  ANCOVA  on  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  convulsive  seizure  frequency  during  the 
treatment  period  including  baseline  and  age  group  as  covariates  and  treatment  group  as  a 
fixed factor. The estimated least squares means, treatment difference, together with the 95% 
CIs and p-value will be presented. 
5.  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  on  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  convulsive  seizure  frequency 
during the maintenance period.  
6.  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  on  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  convulsive  seizure  frequency 
during each 4 weeks of the maintenance period (Week 1 to 4, Week 5 to 8 and Week 9 to 12 of 
the 12-week maintenance period). 
7.  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  on  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  convulsive  seizure  frequency 
during the treatment period, using the worst case  of last observation carried forward (LOCF), 
next observation carried backward (NOCB) and the mean from the non-missing data for each 
patient  to  impute  missing  data  arising  from  unreported  days  in  IVRS  during  the  treatment 
period  only  (not  the  baseline  period).  Any  intermittent  missing  data  for  the  number  of 
convulsive  seizures  arising  from  unreported  days  in  IVRS  will  be  imputed  using  the  worst 
(highest number of seizures) of the following for each patient: LOCF, NOCB and the mean daily 
number  of  seizures  during  the  treatment  period  based  using  non-missing  data:  Number  of 
seizures  ÷  Number  of  reported  days  in  IVRS.  Upon  CHMP  request,  an  additional  sensitivity 
analysis  calculating  the  number  of  seizure  free  days  with  and  without  the  following  missing 
values  strategy:  Unreported  days  are  considered  days  with  the  highest  reported  number  of 
seizures and for patients that withdraw days without observations are considered days with the 
highest reported number of seizures. 
8.  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  on  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  convulsive  seizure  frequency 
during the treatment period, using multiple imputation (MI) to impute data under the Missing 
Not at Random (MNAR) assumption. 
Key secondary efficacy outcome variable: 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  a  ≥  50%  reduction  in  convulsive  seizure  frequency  from  baseline  for 
each treatment group during the entire treatment period was considered a key secondary endpoint for 
the  EU  submission.  The  proportion  was  summarised  by  treatment  group  and  analysed  using  a 
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by age group. The analysis was performed on the ITT 
analysis  set  and  repeated  on  the  PP  analysis  set.  There  was  no  imputation  for  missing  IVRS  days  or 
withdrawals.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  on  the  ITT  analysis  set,  repeating  the  above 
analysis,  using  data  for  the  maintenance  period  only,  and  during  each  4  weeks  of  the  maintenance 
period (Week 1 to 4, Week 5 to 8 and Week 9 to 12 of the 12-week maintenance period). Upon CHMP 
request,  the  Applicant  performed  additional  sensitivity  analyses  for  handling  this  missing  data  using 
Assessment report

Page 102/190 
 
following approach: (1) patients with unreported days in the IVRS and patients that withdraw from the 
study  are  considered  non-responders;  (2)  patients  with  unreported  days  in  the  IVRS  are  considered 
non-responders  if  the  average  of  their  observed  seizures  is  above  50  %  and  patients  that  withdraw 
from the study are considered non-responder. 
Other secondary endpoints: 
For some of the secondary endpoints e.g. the Epworth Daytime Sleepiness scale and the Quality of Life 
scales, if fewer than 50% of the items were missing, the missing items were imputed as the mean of 
the remaining non-missing scores. If more than 50% were missing, the total score would be missing. 
For  the  Quality  of  Life  in  Childhood  Epilepsy,  “not  applicable”  responses  were  treated  as  missing 
values. However, imputation of one item as a mean of other items may not be appropriate since items 
may measure different domains. 
GWEP1424 
Calculation of the primary endpoint 
The primary null hypothesis is: 
• Following 14 weeks of treatment there is no difference in effect between the 20 mg/kg/day (or 10 
mg/kg/day if 20 mg/kg/day is statistically significant) GWP42003-P treatment group and the placebo 
treatment group in terms of the change in convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period 
compared to baseline. 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if there is statistical evidence of a difference between the 
treatment groups at the α-level of 0.05 for the primary endpoint. 
The primary endpoint is the change in convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period of the 
study compared to baseline in patients taking GWP42003-P compared with placebo. 
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using negative binomial regression on the sum of the convulsive 
seizure counts during the treatment period. However, convulsive seizure frequency (28-day average) 
and percentage change in seizure frequency will be presented using summary statistics. Percentage 
change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency will be calculated as: 
 ((Frequency during the treatment period – Frequency during baseline) ÷  
Frequency during baseline) × 100 
The frequency during each period will be based on 28-day averages and calculated as: 
(Number of seizures in the period ÷ Number of reported days in IVRS in the period) × 28 
A mixed effect model with repeated measures will be performed modelling the observed number of 
convulsive seizures in the baseline period and treatment period implemented within the framework of 
general linear models using the negative binomial response distribution. The model will include 
stratified age group (2–5 years, 6–12 years and 13–18 years), time, treatment arm and treatment arm 
by time interaction as fixed effects and patient as a random effect.  
The applicant performed the following sensitivity analyses to account for missing data arising from 
unreported days in the IVRS, and missing data arising from patients withdrawing during the treatment 
period: 
1.  Primary endpoint analysis repeated using the PP analysis set. 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 103/190 
 
 
2.  Wilcoxon rank-sum test on percentage change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency 
during the treatment period. An estimate of the median differences between each GWP42003-P 
group and placebo, together with approximate 95% CIs, will be calculated using the Hodges–
Lehmann approach. 
3.  A rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on percentage change from baseline in convulsive 
seizure frequency during the treatment period. The ranks of the percentage change from 
baseline and the baseline convulsive seizure frequency will be calculated. The rank of the 
percentage change from baseline will then be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with the rank 
of the baseline convulsive seizure frequency and age group (2–5 years, 6–12 years and 13–18 
years) as covariates and treatment group as a fixed factor. The estimated least squares 
means, treatment differences, together with the 95% CIs and p-values will be presented. 
4.  ANCOVA of log transformed convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period. The 
convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period and the baseline convulsive seizure 
frequency will be log transformed prior to analysis. The log transformed convulsive seizure 
frequency during the treatment period will then be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with the 
log transformed baseline convulsive seizure frequency and age group as covariates and 
treatment group as a fixed factor. The back transformed estimated treatment ratios, together 
with the 95% CIs and p-values will be presented. If there are any patients with no seizures 
during the baseline or treatment periods, then 1 will be added to the convulsive seizure 
frequency for all patients prior to log transformation. 
5.  ANCOVA on percentage change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency during the 
treatment period including baseline and age group as covariates and treatment group as a 
fixed factor. The estimated least squares means, treatment differences, together with the 95% 
CIs and p-values will be presented. 
6.  Primary endpoint analysis repeated using the maintenance period rather than the treatment 
period. This analysis will include only patients who have at least 7 days of seizure data within 
the maintenance period. 
7.  Primary endpoint analysis repeated using each 4 weeks of the maintenance period (Week 1–4, 
Week 5–8 and Week 9–12 of the 12-week maintenance period). This analysis will include only 
patients who have at least 7 days of seizure data within each corresponding 4-week period 
rather than the treatment period. 
8.  Primary endpoint analysis repeated using the worst case of last observation carried forward 
(LOCF), next observation carried backward (NOCB) and the daily mean from the non-missing 
data for each patient (rounded up to the nearest integer) to impute missing data arising from 
unreported days in IVRS during the treatment period only (not the baseline period). Any 
intermittent missing data for the number of convulsive seizures arising from unreported days in 
IVRS will be imputed using the worst (highest number of seizures) of the following for each 
patient: LOCF, NOCB and the mean daily number of seizures during the treatment period 
(rounded up to the nearest integer) based on using non-missing data: Number of seizures ÷ 
Number of reported days in IVRS 
9.  Wilcoxon rank-sum test on percentage change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency 
during the treatment period, using multiple imputation (MI) to impute data under the Missing 
Not at Random (MNAR) assumption.  
10. Primary endpoint analysis repeated using the safety analysis set.

Calculations of the key secondary endpoints 
Total Seizures 
The analysis is performed in the same manner as the analyses of frequencies for convulsive seizures 
(primary endpoint). The analysis was performed on the ITT analysis set and repeated on the PP 
analysis set. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the ITT analysis set, repeating the above analysis, 
using data for only the maintenance period, and during each 4 weeks of the maintenance period (Week 
1 to 4, Week 5 to 8 and Week 9 to 12 of the 12-week maintenance period). 
Treatment Responders (≥50% Reduction in Convulsive Seizure Frequency) 
The proportion of patients considered treatment responders, defined as those with a ≥50% reduction 
in convulsive seizure frequency from baseline, during the treatment period, are summarized by 
treatment group and analyzed using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by age group. 
The analysis is performed on the ITT analysis set and repeated on the PP analysis set. 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed on the ITT analysis set, repeating the above analysis, using data 
for the maintenance period only, and during each 4 weeks of the maintenance period (Week 1 to 4, 
Week 5 to 8 and Week 9 to 12 of the 12-week maintenance period). 
Changes from baseline in the Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CGIC) score  
The CGIC will be assessed at Visits 3, 4, 6 and 8 (end of treatment). 
The score at the end of treatment visit and last visit (if different to the end of treatment) will be 
analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. Proportional odds modelling will be carried out by including 
treatment group as a factor. The estimated odds ratios (GWP42003-P arms vs. placebo), 95% CI for 
the odds ratios, and the p-value testing the null hypothesis that the odds ratio is equal to 1, will be 
presented. Analysis performed at the last visit will be considered the main analysis for this endpoint, 
with the analysis at the end of treatment visit considered a sensitivity analysis.

Participant flow 
A total of 177 patients were screened for Part B of this trial, 57 of which were screen failures. A total of 
120 patients were randomized to double-blind treatment. All randomized patients received at least 1 
dose of double-blind IMP and thus were included in the safety analysis set. Part B of this trial was 
conducted at 23 trial sites; 2 in Poland, 4 in France, 3 in the UK and 14 in the US. All sites screened 
patients and 22 sites (2 in Poland, 4 in France, 3 in the UK and 13 in the US) randomized patients into 
the trial. Of the 120 randomized patients, 14 were randomized from Poland, 18 from France, 16 from 
the UK and 72 from the US. 
Of the 120 patients that were randomized in Part B of the trial, 108 patients (90.0%) completed the 
treatment period (52 CBD-OS patients [85.2%] and 56 placebo patients [94.9%]). Twelve patients 
(10.0%) were withdrawn during the treatment period of Part B (9 GWP42003-P patients [14.8%] and 
3 placebo patients [5.1%]); of these, 9 patients (7.5%) withdrew due to an AE (8 GWP42003-P 
patients [13.1%] and 1 placebo patient [1.7%]), 1 placebo patient (1.7%) was lost to follow-up, 1 
placebo patient (1.7%) was withdrawn from the trial by their parents, and 1 CBD-OS patient (1.6%) 
was withdrawn from the trial by the investigator for non-compliance with IMP dosing.

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations: 
During a blinded data review meeting, prior to unblinding of the Part B database, it was confirmed that 
only the 12 patients (10%) who withdrew early were to be excluded from the PP analysis set. Protocol 
deviations  reported  in  the  patients  who  completed  the  trial  were  all  regarded  as  minor  (i.e.,  not 
compromising the assessment of efficacy, and therefore not warranting exclusion from the PP analysis 
set).  A  total  of  94  patients  (78%)  had  at  least  1  protocol  deviation  during  the  trial,  with  similar 
numbers  of  patients  across  the  treatment  groups  (50  CBD-OS  patients  [82.0%]  and  48  placebo 
patients  [81.4%]).  The  most  common  minor  protocol  deviation  (i.e.,  not  deemed  to  compromise 
efficacy) was visit dates being outside the time windows specified in the protocol (28 CBD-OS patients 
[45.9%]  and  21  placebo  patients  [35.6%]).  The  second  most  common  minor  protocol  deviation  was 
the  omission  of  urine  collection  at  1  or  more  visits  (14  CBD-OS  patients  [23.0%]  and  13  placebo 
patients [22.0%]). 
There were 4 instances of patients meeting withdrawal criteria during Part B of the trial, but not being 
withdrawn.  In  3  cases  the  patients  had  raised  levels  of  ALT  or  AST  to  levels  >  3  ×  ULN,  with  a 
concurrent  TEAE  of  fatigue  (2  patients,  1  of  whom  also  had  concurrent  INR  >  1.5)  or  concurrent 
eosinophilia (1 patient). In the remaining case, the patient had levels of ALT or AST > 8 ×ULN at end 
of  treatment.  These  were  all  regarded  as  important  deviations  since  they  related  to  patient  safety; 
however, they were also regarded as minor since all 3 patients completed the trial, and the deviations 
were not expected to impact any assessments of efficacy. 
Protocol amendments: 
Amendment 7 (implementing also changes from Amendment 5) and Amendment 8 were performed 
several months after study start. The changes included an increase in patient numbers and changes in 
eligibility criteria in particular regarding IVRS compliance.  
Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the treatment groups. However, as described 
below, there was an imbalance regarding total seizure frequency at baseline (median 24.00 in the 
CBD-OS group vs. 41.48 in the placebo group). There were also minor imbalances regarding the 
frequency of certain seizure types (atonic and myoclonic seizures). Of the total number of recruited 
subjects, 111 (93%) had a SCN1A mutation either a truncating variant (n=61) or missense variant 
(n=50).

All patients who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of IMP, and had at least 1 post-baseline 
efficacy endpoint were included in the ITT analysis set according to their randomized treatment group. 
The primary efficacy analyses were conducted using the ITT analysis set, which comprised a total of 
120 patients: 61 patients in the GWP42003-P group and 59 patients in the placebo group. Additional 
analyses were conducted using the PP analysis set, which excluded 12 patients who withdrew during 
the treatment period. The PP analysis set comprised a total of 108 patients: 52 patients in the 
GWP42003-P group and 56 patients in the placebo group. No other major deviations were identified. 
The safety analysis set comprised all patients who received at least 1 dose of IMP; no patients were 
excluded from the safety analysis set.

In  the  CBD-OS  group,  the  median  convulsive  seizure  frequency  decreased  (improved)  from  12.44 
during  the  baseline  period  to  5.92  during  the  treatment  period.  In  the  placebo  group,  the  median 
convulsive  seizure  frequency  decreased  (improved)  from  14.88  during  the  baseline  period  to  14.14 
during the treatment period. The median percentage change from baseline in total convulsive seizure 
frequency during the treatment period was −38.94 in the CBD-OS group compared with −13.29 in the 
placebo  group.  The  estimated  median  difference  was  in  favour  of  CBD-OS  treatment  over  placebo 
(−22.79; 95% CI: −41.06, −5.43) and the difference between treatments was statistically significant 
(p=0.0123).

aThe Hodges–Lehmann median difference and 95% CI, and the p-value from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test are presented. 
Sensitivity  analyses  for  the  primary  efficacy  variable  using  the  PP  analysis  set  and  during  the 
maintenance period (and during each 4 weeks thereof) using the ITT analysis set were consistent with 
the result obtained for the primary analysis. In the PP population, the median percentage change from 
baseline in total convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period was −39.60 in the CBD-OS 
group  compared  with  −13.30  in  the  placebo  group  (estimated  median  difference:  −25.99;  95%  CI: 
−44.79,  −8.94).  In  the  ITT  population,  the  median  percentage  change  from  baseline  in  total 
convulsive  seizure  frequency  during  the  maintenance  period  was  −40.67  in  the  CBD-OS  group 
compared with −15.95 in the placebo group (estimated median difference: −26.06; 95% CI: −45.07, 
−8.24). In both cases, the difference between treatments was statistically significant in favour of CBD-
OS treatment over placebo (p=0.0037 and p=0.0052, respectively). 
Sensitivity analyses of imputing missing data from unreported days in the IVRS (using the worst case 
of  LOCF,  NOCB,  or  the  mean  daily  number  of  seizures  during  the  treatment  period,  based  on  non-
missing  data)  and  of  MNAR  using  a  model  with  MI  determined  that  the  primary  analysis  is  robust 
against missing data and that the assumption of data missing not at random does not alter the result 
of the primary analysis. 
Key secondary efficacy variable: 
The proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency from baseline was 
calculated  for  each  treatment  group  during  the  entire  treatment  period  (including  the  dose  titration 
phase  [ITT  and  PP  analysis  sets]).  For  the  purpose  of  the  EU  submission  this  was  the  key  secondary 
endpoint. For the EU submission only, the secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically, starting with 
the key secondary endpoint followed by all other secondary endpoints. For submissions outside the EU, 
there was no hierarchical testing of secondary endpoints. During the treatment period, the proportion 
of patients with a reduction of half or more in their baseline convulsive seizure frequency was greater 
in  the  CBD-OS  group  (42.6%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (27.1%).  There  were  twice  the  odds  of 
achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency in the CBD-OS group compared with the

statistically significant (p=0.0784).

Other secondary efficacy variables: 
Three patients in the CBD-OS group had emergent status epilepticus during the treatment period (one 
convulsive,  two  non-convulsive).  This  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  low  number  of 
events. Furthermore, in the CBD-OS group five patients (8.2%) experienced inpatient hospitalisations 
due  to  epilepsy  during  the  treatment  period  vs.  one  patient  (1.7%)  in  the  placebo  group.  For  the 
energy/fatigue,  depression,  anxiety,  and  self-esteem  subscores  of  the  Quality  of  Life  in  Childhood 
Epilepsy score the treatment difference was in favour of placebo over GWP42003-P.  
For the communication and motor skills scores in the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, the adjusted 
mean  difference  was  in  favour  of  placebo  treatment  over  GWP42003-P  and  the  difference  between 
treatments was statistically significant. Only one-third of caregivers completed the Vineland-II for the 
subdomains  of  communication  and  motor  skills,  and  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  were  small  for 
both treatment groups.  
As requested, applicant presented analysis of change from baseline in convulsive seizure free days, per 
28  days,  using  the  same  definition  of  the  treatment  period  as  used  in  the  primary  endpoint.    The 
observed treatment  difference  (95%  CI)  of  1.44  (0.07,  2.81)  seizure  free  days  per  28 days  favoured 
CBD-OS  (p=0.0396).    However,  analysis  of  the  number  of  total  seizure  free  days  did  not  reach 
statistical significance (p=0.1684).

Figure 19 Patient Disposition (All Randomized Patients) 
Note: Among the 29 patients who had some “other reason” for exclusion, 22 were not approved, 1 withdrew consent but was also captured under 
‘withdrew or withdrawn by parent/guardian’, 1 was noncooperative but was also captured under ‘investigator decision’, 1 was unknown but was 
also captured under ‘investigator decision’, 1 had no caregiver present at randomization, 1 was due to a family bereavement, 1 was due to a 
parent’s decision, and 1 was due to the Sponsor’s decision. One patient assigned 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P was randomized but not treated and 
was therefore excluded from both the efficacy and safety analyses. A further 2 patients assigned 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P temporarily received 
a dose that was above the target and were therefore included in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group for the safety analysis. Among the 2 
patients assigned 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P who had some “other reason” for withdrawal, 1 was due to lack of effect and 1 was on the advice 
of the GW medical monitor as the patient started a new AED treatment. Withdrawals are shown according to the primary reason reported for 
each patient. 
A total of 285 patients were screened; 86 (30.2%) of whom were screen failures. A total of 199 
patients were randomised to double-blind treatment. All but 1 randomised patient received at least 1 
dose of double-blind IMP and thus 198 patients were included in the safety analysis set. 
In total, 43 sites screened patients (26 in the US, 7 in Spain, 5 in Poland, 2 in the Netherlands, 2 in 
Australia and 1 in Israel), of which 38 sites randomised patients into the trial. An additional 2 sites 
were selected but did not screen patients (1 in the US and 1 in Israel). Of the 199 randomised 
patients, 94 were randomised in the US, 39 in Spain, 25 in Poland, 25 in the Netherlands, 13 in 
Australia and 3 in Israel. The date of the first informed consent/assent form signed by a patient or 
their parent(s)/legal representative was 13 April 2015 and the date of the last trial observation was 09 
April 2018. 
Of the 199 patients that were randomised into the trial (67 in the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 
67 in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, and 65 in the pooled placebo group), 190 (95.5%) 
completed the treatment period (64 in the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group [95.5%], 61 in the 20 
mg/kg/day group [91.0%], and 65 in the pooled placebo group [100%]). 
Nine patients (4.5% of total) were withdrawn during the treatment period (3 in the 10 mg/kg/day 
group [4.5%], and 6 in the 20 mg/kg/day group [9.0%]).

During blinded review, a number of patients were deemed to have important protocol deviations with 
the potential to compromise the assessment of efficacy. In total, 17 patients were excluded from the 
PP analysis set; 6 patients (9.0%) randomised to 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, 8 patients (11.9%) 
randomised to 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, 3 patients (4.6%) randomised to placebo. Of the 17 
patients excluded from the PP analysis set, 3 patients (2 randomized to 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, 
and 1 randomized to placebo) were excluded due to protocol deviations; the remaining 14 patients 
that were excluded from the PP analysis set either withdrew during the treatment period (8 patients), 
initiated a new AED during the trial (2 patients; 1 of whom was also captured as having withdrawn 
early), had fewer than 4 convulsive seizures during the first 28 days of the baseline period as captured 
by IVRS (4 patients), or did not receive any IMP (1 patient), and were not excluded due to protocol 
deviations. 
Protocol amendments: 
Changes in the statistical analyses were performed several times - until about two months before 
unblinding. The 3 key secondary endpoints and the hierarchical testing procedure were not defined in 
the protocol but were included in the SAP prior to unblinding. Changes made by protocol amendment 6 
were based upon the results of completed GW Phase 3 trial in DS showed seizure data were not 
normally distributed and required non-parametric analysis. The statistical analysis has therefore been 
changed from a parametric based analysis (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]) to a non-parametric 
based analysis (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). By means of protocol amendment 7, the primary analysis 
method was updated from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to a negative binomial regression analysis and 
primary endpoint was amended from “percentage change in total convulsive seizure frequency…” to 
”change in total convulsive seizure frequency…”, since percentage change does not apply to negative 
binomial regression. ‘ 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics were similar across the treatment groups. Overall, there was a similar 
proportion of male (47.5%) and female (52.5%) patients. The distribution of current seizure types 
reported at screening was similar across the treatment groups, with generalized tonic-clonic being 
most common, followed by myoclonic, absence and complex partial.

Numbers analysed 
All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of IMP and had post-baseline efficacy data were 
included in the ITT analysis set according to the treatment group to which they were randomized. The 
ITT analysis set therefore excluded 1 patient in the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group who was 
randomized in error and did not receive IMP, and thus comprised a total of 198 patients: 66 patients in 
the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 67 patients in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, and 65 
patients in the placebo group 
All patients who completed the trial with no protocol deviations deemed to compromise the assessment 
of efficacy were included in the PP analysis set according to the treatment group to which they were 
randomized. In addition to the 1 patient in the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group who was randomized 
but not treated, the PP analysis set excluded a further 16 patients (5 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P group, 8 patients in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, and 3 patients in the placebo 
group) comprising 8 patients who withdrew from the trial early, 3 patients with major protocol 
deviations (1 patient satisfied both of these criteria) (see Section 7.1), 2 patients who had new AEDs 
initiated during the trial, and 4 patients who, during the baseline period, mistakenly entered seizure 
types into the IVRS that did not meet the description approved by the committee of external experts. 
Accordingly, the PP analysis set comprised a total of 182 patients: 61 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P group, 59 patients in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, and 62 patients in the 
placebo group. 
All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of IMP were included in the safety analysis set 
according to the treatment they received. The safety analysis set therefore excluded 1 patient in the

10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group who was randomized in error and did not receive IMP. Furthermore, 
upon blinded review of the data, it was identified that 4 patients randomized to receive 10 mg/kg/day 
dosing volumes (comprising 2 patients assigned GWP42003-P and 2 patients assigned placebo) were 
given dosing schedules for 20 mg/kg/day volumes and thus titrated above the 10 mg/kg/day target 
dose; therefore, these patients were assigned to the 20 mg/kg/day treatment groups (GWP42003-P or 
placebo) in the safety analysis set. Accordingly, the safety analysis set comprised a total of 198 
patients: 64 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 69 patients in the 20 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P group, and 65 patients in the placebo group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable: 
The primary endpoint was the change in total convulsive seizures during the treatment period 
(including the initial dose titration period) compared to baseline. The primary endpoint was analysed 
using negative binomial regression; therefore, results are presented with an estimated ratio of the 
ratios of LS means (treatment period to baseline period) and 95% CI for the ratio, along with the p-
value testing the null hypothesis that the ratio of each GWP42003-P group to placebo was 1. 
During the baseline period, the median convulsive seizure frequency (28-day average) was highest in 
the placebo group and lowest in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group. The placebo effect was 
considerable.

Sensitivity analyses: 
Results were consistent with the primary analysis when repeated using the PP analysis set. The 
Hodges–Lehmann estimated median difference between treatments was in favor of GWP42003-P over 
placebo for both GWP42003-P groups (20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day). Using Wilcoxon rank–sum 
tests, rank ANCOVA approach and an ANCOVA approach were in favour of GWP42003-P over placebo 
for both GWP42003-P groups (20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day) but results were statistically 
significant only for 20 mg/kg/day vs placebo. 
Results of the primary analysis after imputing unreported days in the IVRS are presented in Figure 21. 
For this analysis, missing data from the treatment period arising from unreported days in the IVRS 
were imputed using the worst (highest number of seizures) of the following for each GWP42003-P 
patient who withdrew during the treatment period: LOCF, NOCB, and the mean daily number of 
seizures during the treatment period (using the non-missing data). The treatment ratio was in favour 
of GWP42003-P over placebo for both GWP42003-P groups (20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day). The 
difference between treatments was statistically significant for 10 mg/kg/day vs. placebo (P=0.0163) 
but was not statistically significant for 20 mg/kg/day vs. placebo (P=0.0563).

Change in Total Seizures during the Treatment Period Compared to Baseline 
The percentage reduction in total seizures was greater in both GWP42003-P groups (20 mg/kg/day and 
10 mg/kg/day) compared with the placebo group (Table 27). The differences between each 
GWP42003-P group and placebo were statistically significant (Figure 20).

placebo for both GWP42003-P groups (20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day) and the differences in 
proportions were statistically significant when analysed using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test

analyses. 
Caregiver Global Impression of Change Score 
The proportion of patients with any improvement in overall condition (slightly improved, much 
improved, or very much improved) at their last visit (i.e., incorporating LOCF, the last visit at which 
the CGIC assessment was conducted for an individual patient) was higher in the 20 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P group (60.6%) and 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group (68.2%) compared with the 
placebo group (41.5%). Only 1 placebo patient (1.5%) was reported as ‘very much improved’ 
compared with 11 patients (16.7%) in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group and 13 patients (19.7%) 
in the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group. Approximately half (49.2%) of the patients in the placebo 
group who completed the assessment were reported as having no change. The proportion of patients 
reported as having a worsening in overall condition (slightly worse, much worse or very much worse) 
at last visit was numerically greater in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group (13.6%) compared with 
the 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group (4.5%) and the placebo group (9.2%) (Figure 23); similar 
trends were observed using the PP analysis set.

When measured on a continuous scale (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse), the mean 
CGIC scores at last visit were 3.1 in the 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group and 2.8 in the 10 
mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, each corresponding to “slightly improved”. In the placebo group the 
mean CGIC score at last visit was 3.6 (most closely associated with “no change”). The OR for achieving 
a lower score (improvement) was in favor of GWP42003-P over placebo for both GWP42003-P groups 
(20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day) and the differences were statistically significant when analyzed 
using ordinal logistic regression (Figure 26). Sensitivity analyses using end of treatment CGIC scores 
and the PP analysis set showed similar results.

Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction 
with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
Table A1.     Summary of efficacy for trial GWEP1414 (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) 
A  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  cannabidiol  (GWP42003-P;  CBD-OS)  as  adjunctive  treatment  for  seizures

Protocol No: GWEP1414 
EudraCT No: 2014-002940-42 
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02224560 
Trial GWEP1414 was a 14-week treatment period, multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of 2 dose levels of cannabidiol oral-solution (CBD-OS; 
10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day) vs. placebo.  Information on seizures was recorded daily using an interactive voice response system.  Information 
on investigational medicinal product (IMP) usage, concomitant medications, and adverse events was recorded daily in a paper diary.  Following a 4-
week baseline period, eligible patients were randomized to 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS or placebo at a 1:1:1 ratio. 
Following  completion  of  the  trial,  patients  were  invited  to  receive  CBD-OS  in  an  open-label  extension  (OLE)  trial  under  a  separate  protocol 
(GWEP1415).

Primary Analysis: 
Percentage  change 
drop seizure frequency 
in 
The pre-defined primary efficacy outcome variable was the percentage change from baseline in 
drop seizure frequency (average per 28 days) during the 14-week treatment period, based on the 
intent to treat (ITT) analysis set, comparing CBD-OS with placebo as add-on treatment. 
The  data  were  analyzed  using  a  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  (due  to  the  nature  of  seizure  data, 
normal  distribution  cannot  be  assumed).    An  estimate  of  the  median  difference  between  20 
mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  and  placebo,  and  10 mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  and  placebo,  together  with 
approximate 95% confidence interval (CI), was calculated using the Hodges-Lehmann approach. 
A step-down procedure was used to control the type 1 error; for further details see ‘Notes’ in the 
primary analysis section in this table.

The  data  were  analyzed  using  a  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  (due  to  the  nature  of  seizure  data, 
normal  distribution  cannot  be  assumed).    An  estimate  of  the  median  difference  between  20 
mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  and  placebo,  and  10 mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  and  placebo,  together  with

Type 1 Error Control 
The primary endpoint, and key secondary endpoints, had 2 comparisons against placebo (20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS vs. placebo and 10 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS  vs.  placebo).    These  endpoints  were  tested  with  their  Type 1  error  controlled  by  use  of  a  pre-specified  hierarchical  gate-keeping 
procedure, in the following sequence (all vs. placebo): primary endpoint 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS,  primary endpoint 10  mg/kg/day  CBD-OS, 1st 
key secondary endpoint 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 2nd key secondary endpoint 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 3rd key secondary endpoint 20 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS, 1st key secondary endpoint 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 2nd key secondary endpoint 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 3rd key secondary endpoint 10 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS.  The null hypothesis of an endpoint had to be rejected at the level of 0.05 (2-sided) to test the hypothesis of the subsequent 
endpoint in the sequence at the level of 0.05 (2-sided).  If a null hypothesis was not rejected then testing would stop and all subsequent analyses 
would be declared not statistically significant. 
Patient Withdrawals 
A total of 13 patients withdrew from the trial (9 from the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, 2 from the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group and 2 from the 
placebo  group).    The  most  common  primary  reason  for  withdrawal  was  adverse  events  (4  patients  from  the  20  mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  group,  1 
patient from the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group and 1 patient from the placebo group).  Withdrawn patients were included in the ITT analysis set.

 A combined score was used as the primary analysis for this endpoint.  The combined score was defined as follows: if both a CGIC and SGIC 
were completed then the CGIC was used, if only a CGIC was completed then the CGIC was used, and if only a SGIC was completed then the 
SGIC was used.

 The global impression of change was analyzed using an ordinal logistic regression model with treatment group as a fixed factor (ordinal values 
were as follows: 1 = very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = slightly improved; 4 = no change; 5 = slightly worse; 6 = much worse; 7 = 
very much worse).

A  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  cannabidiol  (GWP42003-P;  CBD-OS)  as  adjunctive  treatment  for  seizures 
associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome in children and adults.

Trial GWEP1423 was a 14-week treatment period, multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of 20 mg/kg/day cannabidiol oral-solution (CBD-OS) 
vs.  placebo.    Information  on  seizures  was  recorded  daily  using  an  interactive  voice  response  system.    Information  on  investigational  medicinal 
product  (IMP)  usage,  concomitant  medications,  and  adverse  events  was  recorded  daily  in  a  paper  diary.    Following  a  4-week  baseline  period, 
eligible patients were randomized to 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. 
Following  completion  of  the  trial,  patients  were  invited  to  receive  CBD-OS  in  an  open-label  extension  (OLE)  trial  under  a  separate  protocol 
(GWEP1415).

The pre-defined primary efficacy outcome variable was the percentage change from baseline in 
drop seizure frequency (average per 28 days) during the 14-week treatment period, based on the 
intent to treat (ITT) analysis set, comparing CBD-OS with placebo as add-on treatment. 
The  data  were  analyzed  using  a  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  (due  to  the  nature  of  seizure  data, 
normal  distribution  cannot  be  assumed).    An  estimate  of  the  median  difference  between  20 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS and placebo, together with approximate 95% confidence interval (CI), was 
calculated using the Hodges-Lehmann approach. 
A step-down procedure was used to control the type 1 error; for further details see ‘Notes’ in the 
primary analysis section in this table. 
The first pre-specified key secondary endpoint was the number of patients considered treatment 
responders,  defined  as  those  with  a  ≥  50%  reduction  in  drop  seizure  frequency  from  baseline 
during the treatment period, based on the ITT analysis set, comparing CBD-OS with placebo as 
add-on treatment. 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  were  considered  treatment  responders,  the  difference  in 
proportions  along  with  the  95%  CI  for  the  difference,  the  estimated  odds  ratio  (OR) 
(20 mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  vs.  placebo), 95%  CI  for  the  OR,  and  the  p-value  from  the  Cochran–
Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test were presented.

Type 1 Error Control 
The key secondary endpoints were tested with their Type 1 error controlled by use of a pre-specified hierarchical gate-keeping procedure, in the 
following sequence (all 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS vs. placebo): primary endpoint, 1st key secondary endpoint, 2nd key secondary endpoint, 3rd key 
secondary endpoint.  The null hypothesis of an endpoint had to be rejected at the level of 0.05 (2-sided) to test the hypothesis of the subsequent 
endpoint in the sequence at the level of 0.05 (2-sided).  If a null hypothesis was not rejected then testing would stop and all subsequent analyses 
would be declared not statistically significant. 
Patient Withdrawals 
A  total  of  15 patients  withdrew  from  the  trial  (14  from  the  20  mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  group  and 1  from  the  placebo  group).    The  most  common 
primary  reason  for  withdrawal  was  adverse  events  (8  patients  from  the  20 mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  group  and  1  patient  from  the  placebo  group).  
Withdrawn patients were included in the ITT analysis set.

 A combined score was used as the primary analysis for this endpoint.  The combined score was defined as follows: if both a CGIC and SGIC 
were completed then the CGIC was used, if only a CGIC was completed then the CGIC was used, and if only a SGIC was completed then the 
SGIC was used. 
b
 The global impression of change was analyzed using an ordinal logistic regression model with treatment group as a fixed factor (ordinal values 
were as follows: 1 = very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = slightly improved; 4 = no change; 5 = slightly worse; 6 = much worse; 7 = 
very much worse). 
A step-down procedure was used to control the type 1 error; for further details see the ‘Notes’ in the primary analysis section in this table.

Table A3.     Summary of efficacy for trial GWEP1332 Part B (Dravet syndrome) 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-part study to investigate the dose-ranging safety and pharmacokinetics, followed by the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol (GWP42003-P; 
CBD-OS) in children and young adults with Dravet syndrome.

Protocol No: GWEP1332 
EudraCT No: 2014-000995-24 
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02091375 
Part  B  of  trial  GWEP1332  was  a  14-week  treatment  period,  multisite,  randomized,  double-blind  trial  of  20 mg/kg/day  cannabidiol  oral-solution 
(CBD-OS)  vs.  placebo.    Information on  seizures  was  recorded  daily  using  an  interactive  voice  response  system.    Information  on  investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) usage, concomitant medications, and adverse events was recorded daily in a paper diary.  Following a 4-week baseline 
period, eligible patients were randomized to 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. 
Following  completion  of  the  trial,  patients  were  invited  to  receive  CBD-OS  in  an  open-label  extension  (OLE)  trial  under  a  separate  protocol 
(GWEP1415). 
Note:  Part A of trial GWEP1332 was a 3-week dose-ranging, safety and pharmacokinetic trial; no efficacy data was collected.

convulsive

in 
seizure 
The pre-defined primary efficacy outcome variable was the percentage change from baseline in 
total convulsive seizure  frequency (average per  28 days) during the 14-week treatment period, 
based  on  the  intent  to  treat  (ITT)  analysis  set,  comparing  CBD-OS  with  placebo  as  add-on 
treatment. 
The  data  were  analyzed  using  a  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  (due  to  the  nature  of  seizure  data, 
normal  distribution  cannot  be  assumed).    An  estimate  of  the  median  difference  between  20 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS and placebo, together with approximate 95% confidence interval (CI), was 
calculated using the Hodges-Lehmann approach. 
A step-down procedure was used to control the type 1 error; for further details see ‘Notes’ in the 
primary analysis section in this table. 
The first pre-specified key secondary endpoint was the number of patients considered treatment 
responders,  defined  as  those  with  a  ≥  50%  reduction  in  convulsive  seizure  frequency  from 
baseline  during  the  treatment  period,  based  on  the  ITT  analysis  set,  comparing  CBD-OS  with 
placebo as add-on treatment. 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  were  considered  treatment  responders,  the  difference  in 
proportions  along  with  the  95%  CI  for  the  difference,  the  estimated  odds  ratio  (OR) 
(20 mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  vs.  placebo),  95%  CI  for  the  OR,  and  the  p-value  from  the  Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test were presented.

Type 1 Error Control 
The  key  secondary  endpoint  was  tested  with  its  Type  1  error  controlled  by  use  of  a  pre-specified  hierarchical  gate-keeping  procedure,  in  the 
following sequence (both 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS vs. placebo): primary endpoint followed by the key secondary endpoint.  The null hypothesis of 
the  primary  endpoint  had to be  rejected  at  the  level  of  0.05  (2-sided)  to  test  the  hypothesis of  the  key  secondary  endpoint  at  the  level  of  0.05 
(2-sided).    If  the  null  hypothesis  for  the  primary  endpoint  was  not  rejected  then  testing  would  stop  and  the  key  secondary  endpoint  would  be 
declared not statistically significant. 
Patient Withdrawals 
A  total  of  12  patients  withdrew  from  the  trial  (9  from  the  20  mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  group  and  3  from  the  placebo  group).    The  most  common 
primary reason for withdrawal was an adverse event (8 patients from the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group and 1 patient from the placebo group).  
Withdrawn patients were included in the ITT analysis set.

Type 1 Error Control 
The primary endpoint, and key secondary endpoints, had 2 comparisons against placebo (20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS vs. placebo and 10 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS vs. placebo).  These endpoints were tested with their Type 1 error controlled by use of a pre-specified hierarchical gate-keeping 
procedure, in the following sequence (all vs. placebo): primary endpoint 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, primary endpoint 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 1st 
key secondary endpoint 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 1st key secondary endpoint 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 2nd key secondary endpoint 20 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS, 2nd key secondary endpoint 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 3rd key secondary endpoint 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, 3rd key secondary endpoint 10 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS.  The null hypothesis of an endpoint had to be rejected at the level of 0.05 (2-sided) to test the hypothesis of the subsequent 
endpoint in the sequence at the level of 0.05 (2-sided).  If a null hypothesis was not rejected then testing would stop and all subsequent analyses

Patient Withdrawals 
A total of 9 patients withdrew from the trial (6 from the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group and 3 from the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group; all patients 
in the placebo group completed the trial).  The most common primary reason for withdrawal was adverse events (5 patients from the 20 mg/kg/day

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Side-by-side presentation of the individual trial results was used to highlight consistencies and 
variations in the efficacy data across the indications and doses.  
Of particular interest is a side-by-side presentation of subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint 
performed in all four pivotal studies. A trend towards larger treatment differences in patients taking 
clobazam as compared to patients not on clobazam was observed, and the treatment difference for 
patients not on clobazam was smaller (<15% change from placebo) in 4 out of 6 off-CLB groups .

In order to address the CHMP concerns related to the observed trend towards larger treatment 
differences in patients taking clobazam as compared to patients not on clobazam when analysing 
change from baseline, and the fact that the treatment difference for patients not on clobazam was 
smaller in most treatment arms, the Applicant performed various analyses intended to demonstrate 
efficacy of CBD-OS independent from the co-administration of clobazam and that the treatment effect 
is clinically meaningful. The most relevant are reflected below: 
•  Heterogeneous population of patients not taking clobazam  
Clobazam (CLB) is commonly used as part of multi-drug therapy in patients with LGS and DS.  In the 
CBD-OS pivotal program, approximately half of patients with LGS and one-third of patients with DS 
were not taking CLB.  Most of these patients had previously failed CLB therapy (Figure 26).

The subgroup of patients not taking concomitant CLB is more heterogenous and contains different 
patient populations that are not represented in the subgroup taking CLB, including a majority of 
patients who had received CLB previously. 
In the pivotal CBD-OS trials, differences in terms of baseline characteristics were observed between 
the patients not taking clobazam and patients taking CLB (Table 41).  The analyses show that the 
patients not taking concomitant CLB had previously failed more AEDs.

•  Stratified meta-analyses of all pivotal studies focused on CBD-OS’s anticonvulsant effect 
independent of clobazam use 
The applicant presented data from stratified meta-analyses that statistically combined estimates of 
treatment effect from the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups vs. placebo.  Estimates from the 
20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups vs. placebo combined and 10 + 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups vs. 
placebo combined were also presented for comparison.

The 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS dose was associated with a 12% greater reduction in primary seizure count 
over placebo for patients not taking CLB (P=0.149).  
•  Rationale for attenuated response in change in the seizure count analysis in patients not taking 
clobazam, while having little impact on the responder analyses 
The drop seizure response rates for 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS patients with LGS not taking CLB 
concomitantly is presented in Figure 31.

The 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS dose also demonstrated benefit over placebo at ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, and 
≥ 75% levels of drop seizure reduction compared with placebo (right side of Figure 31), with 52% of 
CBD-OS patients attaining a ≥ 25% reduction in drop seizure frequency compared to 38% of placebo 
patients.  However, more 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS patients experienced a paradoxical increase in drop 
seizure frequency compared with placebo (left side of Figure 31), most notably at the > 25% level of 
increase.  As a result, the primary endpoint of reduction in drop seizure frequency is attenuated for the 
20 mg/kg/day group not taking CLB, but the key secondary endpoint of ≥ 50% reduction in drop 
seizure frequency is not affected.  It should be noted that the degree of seizure increase was no 
greater with CBD-OS compared with placebo for patients not taking CLB in the pivotal DS trials. This 
paradoxical seizure increase at the 20 mg/kg/day dose level without CLB was not present at the 
Epidyolex 10 mg/kg/day dose level and was not seen in the 2 pivotal DS trials at either dose. 
Increased seizure frequency is a common risk in drug-resistant epilepsies including LGS and DS, and 
the Epidyolex SmPC contains a warning of this potential risk, similar to other AEDs.

•  Clinical relevance of CBD-OS treatment effect for patients not taking clobazam 
The meta-analyses for the key ≥ 50% response rate for patients not taking CLB concomitantly are 
presented by CBD-OS dose in Figure 32. For these analyses, a conservative approach addressing 
missing data was used, whereby any patients who were withdrawn during treatment were considered 
non-responders.  The proportion of patients not taking CLB with a ≥ 50% reduction from their baseline 
primary seizure frequency was 24.6% across the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups compared with 7.9% 
across the placebo groups; this difference in proportions was nominally statistically significant 
(P=0.026).  The ≥ 50% responder rate for patients not taking CLB across the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS 
groups was 28.8% compared with 15.7% across the placebo groups and this difference in proportions 
was also nominally statistically significant (P=0.022). CBD-OS at both 10 and 20 mg/kg/day increased 
the likelihood of achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in seizure frequency to a similar degree for patients 
taking or not taking CLB.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Only patients between 2 and 55 years of age were included in the pivotal trials. Children below 2 years 
of age were not included in any of the pivotal trials. 
Supportive studies 
A Phase 3 Open Label Extension (OLE) trial (GWEP1415) and an expanded access program (EAP) 
conducted under physician-sponsored investigational new drug (IND) applications in the United States 
(US), provide supportive efficacy data for CBD-OS as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of seizures 
associated with LGS and DS. Patients who completed the treatment period of the pivotal trials had the 
option to enrol in the OLE trial to evaluate the continued safety and efficacy of CBD-OS, which was 
taken twice daily as adjunctive therapy. The EAP enrolled patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies, 
including LGS and DS.

a The efficacy dataset excluded Australia as seizure data were collected only for sites in the US. 
b As per data cutoff dates of 01 May 17 (GWEP1415) and 08 December 2016 (EAP). 
GWEP1415 
This is an ongoing open-label extension trial for patients with LGS or DS who previously completed a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled 'core' trial (GWEP1414, GWEP1423, GWEP1332, or the ongoing 
GWEP1424 trial). The trial comprises a 2-week dose titration period, a maintenance period, a 10-day 
taper period, and a 4-week follow-up period. Patients may receive treatment for up to 3 years if in the 
USA, France or Poland, and for up to 1 year if in UK, Spain, The Netherlands, or Israel. Information on 
seizures is recorded weekly using an IVRS. All patients titrate CBD-OS to 20 mg/kg/day and continue 
on this dose. However, the investigator may decrease the dose in case of intolerance or increase the 
dose in an attempt to achieve better seizure control. The maximum dose is 30 mg/kg/day. 
Primary endpoint: AE profile and other safety assessments. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included in the interim analysis (data cut-off 3 November 2016): 
For the interim analysis, the primary efficacy dataset included patients from all 4 pivotal trials. Efficacy 
endpoints using the primary efficacy dataset included the percentage change from the pivotal trial 
baseline in seizure frequency (average per 28 days), maintenance of seizure frequency reduction, and 
freedom from seizures for (1) drop seizures in patients with LGS only; (2) convulsive seizures in 
patients with DS only and in all patients combined; and (3) total seizures in patients with LGS only, DS 
only, and in all patients combined. S/CGIC at last visit was also included as a secondary endpoint. 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019

A total of 630 patients (366 LGS, 264 DS) enrolled from the preceding core trials, including 
GWEP1332A and GWEP1424, which was still ongoing by the interim data cut date (03 November 
2016). At the data cut date, 34 patients (5%; all DS) had completed treatment, 142 patients (23%; 67 
LGS, 75 DS) had withdrawn, and 454 patients (72%; 299 LGS, 155 DS) were continuing with 
treatment. Overall, the majority of patients White/Caucasian (87%) and from the USA (68%); 53% 
were male. The mean age was 13.4 years. A total of 284 patients enrolled from the 3 pivotal trials 
(209 with LGS, 75 with DS) had been treated for at least 37 weeks in the OLE at the time of the 
interim data cut date. 
Patients in the open-label extension study experienced a reduction in seizure frequency compared to 
pivotal trial baseline values. The median reductions were comparable in magnitude with that observed 
in the pivotal trial active groups. According to the Applicant, this demonstrates maintenance of 
efficacy. To account for differences in sample size with increasing time, the Applicant also analysed the 
subgroups of patients treated for 37-48 weeks, and found similar results.  
Expanded Access Program (EAP) 
The EAP comprised physician-initiated emergency, individual, intermediate, and State initiated 
intermediate INDs in the US, and a Compassionate Access Scheme in New South Wales, Australia. 
These were open-label observational studies for patients with refractory epilepsies, which included 
those with LGS or DS who were not candidates for the pivotal trials. The efficacy dataset excluded 
Australia because, per protocol, patients enrolled into the Compassionate Access Scheme in New South 
Wales had ‘uncountable’ seizures. Generally, there was a dose titration period lasting 5–8 weeks, a 
maintenance period, a 1-month taper period, and a 1-month follow-up period. Dose titration commonly 
started at 5 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, given in 2 divided doses, and increased by 5 mg/kg every 3–14 days 
up to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day, depending on the site. Efficacy endpoints discussed here were the 
percentage change from baseline in convulsive and total seizure frequencies (average per 28 days) in 
patients with LGS and DS combined. Data received by the cut-off date of 08 December 2016 was used 
for reporting of results. 
A total of 92 patients with LGS and 58 patients with DS were included in the analyses of efficacy. At 
the interim data cut date (08 December 2016), 24/92 patients with LGS (26%) and 17/58 patients 
with DS (29%) had withdrawn. In the LGS efficacy analysis set, the mean [SD] age was 12.6 [6.9] 
years; 66% were male. Forty-eight patients (52%) had been treated for more than 1 year. In the DS 
efficacy analysis set, the mean [SD] age was 12.4 [7.9] years; 53% were male. Thirty-eight patients 
(66%) had been treated for more than 1 year. 
Patients experienced a median reduction in seizure frequency comparable in magnitude with that 
observed in the pivotal trial active groups.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal trials were designed as double-blind parallel-group placebo-controlled trials with a baseline 
period of 4 weeks and a treatment period of 14 weeks (titration phase 2 weeks, maintenance phase 12 
weeks), after which the patients either entered an open-label extension study or (upon 
completion/withdrawal) tapered the dose over a 10-day period with a safety follow-up 4 weeks after 
final dose.  
The pivotal trials were designed to evaluate 10 mg/kg/day or 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS vs. placebo as 
adjunctive therapy. This is appropriately reflected in the wording of the approved indication. 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 144/190 
 
The choice of doses was not based on dose-response information since no such information was 
available for any indication before entering phase 3. In order to inform dosing and treatment decisions, 
the applicant carried out a post hoc analysis of efficacy by cumulative day during the first 14 days of 
treatment (titration period) of trials GWEP1423, GWEP1414 and GWEP1332B.  Per the titration 
schedule, all patients started on 2.5 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (or equivalent volume of placebo) and 
reached 10 mg/kg/day on Days 7 and 8 of the titration period; patients randomised to 20 mg/kg/day 
reached full dose on Day 11. These data showed that noticeable reductions in seizure frequency can be 
achieved when CBD OS is titrated to a dose of 7.5 mg/kg/day in both LGS and DS.  This is further 
supported by evidence of a benefit for CBD OS over placebo in the proportions of patients who 
achieved a ≥ 50% reduction from their baseline primary seizure frequency during the first 8 days of 
treatment, during which time a dose of 10 mg/kg/day had been reached. In addition, the results of 
study GWEP1424 showed significant improvement compared to placebo treatment for CBD-OS 20 and 
10 mg/kg/day on the primary efficacy endpoint and all key secondary efficacy endpoints. Collectively, 
the data support the applicant’s proposal to establish as maintenance dose 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS for 
both indications.   
The titration regimen used in the studies was different from that proposed in the SmPC. Indeed the 
proposed titration scheme is a simplified version compared to the one used in pivotal clinical trials. 
Specifically, the starting does used in the pivotal clinical trials was 2.5mg/kg/day while the SmPC 
proposes to start the treatment at 5mg/kg/day. In addition, the up titration was done with dose 
increments of 2.5 mg/kg/day over two days period while the proposed posology indicates that after 
one week the dose should be increased with 5mg/kg/day to a target maintenance dose of 
10mg/kg/day. It is agreed that the proposed posology, in comparison to the one used in clinical trials, 
is convenient and minimizes dosing errors. In terms of starting dose, it is worth acknowledging that, 
based on the presented data, 2.5 mg/kg/day is not an effective dose. The proposed titration scheme 
was designed to benefit patients/caregivers and prescribers, and it was supported by population PK 
modelling and simulation results submitted by the applicant. These results show little difference in 
plasma levels of CBD between titration schemes (clinical trials vs proposed posology), particularly at 
10 mg/kg/day. In addition, the 10 mg/kg/day dose in LGS trial GWEP1414 demonstrated efficacy 
paired with better safety profile (see safety section of this report) compared with the 20mg/kg/day 
dose showing a lower incidence of transaminase elevations and overall AEs. Based on the above 
considerations the CHMP agreed with the proposed posology (see SmPC section 4.2) with a starting 
dose of 5 mg/kg/day which can be up titrated with 5 mg/kg/day up to a target maintenance dose of 10 
mg/kg/day and in patients who tolerate the 10 mg/kg/day dose but require greater levels of seizure 
reduction further up titration, with 5 mg/kg/day dose increments, are allowed up to a daily dose of 
20 mg/kg.  
Another shortcoming of the study designs was the fact that it was not specified in the study protocols 
whether the investigational product should be taken with food. While it is acknowledged that based on 
the submitted data it is not possible to define the conditions under which CBD-OS should be 
administered, the CHMP agreed with the applicant’s proposal that prandial status should be the same 
at each subsequent CBD-OS administration in order to reduce the inter-individual variability. The fact 
that CBD-OS should be administered consistently either with or without food intake is appropriately 
reflected in SmPC section 4.2 and PIL. 
In very few patients CBD-OS was administered via nasogastric tubes. The applicant presented efficacy 
data from a total of 8 patients which took IMP via a gastric/gastrostomy tube (G-tube) during the 
pivotal trials of which only 6 completed the trials. While the percentage change from baseline in total 
seizure frequency during the treatment period reported in these patients shows a reduction in seizure 
frequency in patients on CBD-OS, compared with the patients on placebo, the CHMP agrees that no 
Assessment report

Page 145/190 
 
meaningful conclusions can be drawn due to the small sample size and consequently no PI 
recommendations can be made in this regard.  
During the studies, investigators were allowed to reduce the dose of IMP or a concomitant AED if a 
patient experienced adverse events (AEs) but if IMP was reduced, they were encouraged to titrate the 
patient back up to the target dose when possible. Dose reductions due to AEs were not recorded as 
protocol deviations although dose reductions could potentially compromise blinding. Dose reductions of 
CLB were necessary in approximately 25% of LGS patients on CBD-OS 20 mg/kg/day as compared to 
3-10% of patients on placebo. In patients with DS, dose reductions of CBD-OS were necessary in 18% 
of patients on CBD-OS 20 mg/kg/day as compared to 0 on placebo. The applicant performed a 
subgroup analyses on each arm of trials GWEP1414, GWEP1423 and GWEP1332B which showed that 
treatment differences remained in favour of CBD-OS following the exclusion of patients with IMP 
and/or CLB or VPA dose reductions during the trial. This doesn’t rule out the possibility that dose 
reductions may in some cases have disclosed the treatment assignment but in the absence of any 
evidence suggesting that such instances have occurred, the CHMP considers that the potential for 
unblinding is not a significant concern. 
Seizure numbers and types were recorded daily by the caregiver during the baseline and treatment 
period using an IVRS. At the screening visit, each principal investigator (PI) and the caregiver(s) of the 
patient discussed the seizure semiology for each seizure type, and they confirmed the different known 
seizure presentations of the patient.  The precise seizure description was recorded on the Epilepsy 
Diary Reference Sheet and provided to the caregiver for reference, who began calling in to IVRS that 
same evening. To ensure accuracy of seizure identification and reporting across the pivotal trials, 
seizure types were verified by members of a committee of independent experts The International 
League against Epilepsy (ILAE) 1989 seizure classifications were used in the pivotal trials. The ILAE 
classifications are used routinely in clinical practice; therefore, it is expected that caregivers are 
accustomed to recording these seizure types and reporting their frequency. The CHMP’s view was that 
the training provided to the care givers seemed brief given the highly demanding task of correctly 
classifying seizures. However, it was acknowledged that the caregivers are used to identify and report 
the seizure frequency, on regular basis, outside clinical trials setting and the training provided during 
the clinical trial would complement the one received in ‘clinical practice’. Consequently, the CHMP 
agreed that the reported seizure frequency can be considered reliable.    
CBD-OS was presented as an oral solution containing 100 mg/mL CBD in sesame oil with anhydrous 
ethanol (79 mg/mL), added sweetener (sucralose), and strawberry flavouring. Placebo was presented 
as an oral solution of sesame oil containing anhydrous ethanol (79 mg/mL), added sweetener 
(sucralose), and strawberry flavouring. A palatability questionnaire had to be completed in trials 
GWEP1423, GWEP1414 and GWEP1332B to assess caregiver’s perceived palatability of IMP for product 
development purposes.  A 5-point Likert scale was used in each trial, the results of which were not 
analysed until after the trial was completed and the blind was broken. According to the results for trial 
GWEP1332B, there was clearly no preference for like or dislike of CBD-OS taste.  Similarly, for trials 
GWEP1414 and GWEP1423, there was no clear preference for the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group.  
However, in trial GWEP1414 in the 10 mg/kg/day group, there was a higher proportion of patients who 
liked the taste of CBD-OS.  In the placebo groups, there were similar rates of neutral response (i.e., 
neither liked it nor disliked it) across the trials. Despite the fact that it cannot be excluded that the 
taste of CBD-OS would be perceived differently - and less pleasant - than that of placebo as reflected 
by the caregiver palatability scores, neither the applicant or the patients were aware about these 
difference during the trial conduct. Based on this the CHMP considers that the possible perceived 
difference in taste between the active and placebo formulations had no impact on the reliability of the 
study results.

During the recruitment phase of two of the pivotal studies (GWEP1423 and GWEP1332B), protocol 
amendments were implemented, during the recruitment period, increasing patient numbers and 
changing eligibility criteria in particular regarding IVRS compliance. This led to the concern that slightly 
different patient populations were recruited before and after the protocol amendment’s implementation 
especially in study GWEP1423. In order to assess the impact of the amendment on the treatment 
effect, the applicant conducted post hoc analyses of the primary outcome in patients randomised 
before vs. after amendment 4 in study GWEP1423.  Treatment differences were in favour of CBD-OS 
over placebo for both patient populations and were no greater for patients randomised under 
amendment 4. 
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (Studies GWEP1414 and GWEP1423) 
Patient population 
In order to be eligible for the trial, patients had to be aged 2–55 years with a clinical diagnosis of LGS. 
Patients must have had at least 2 drop seizures each week during the first 28 days of the baseline 
period and have a history of slow (< 3.0 Hz) spike-and-wave pattern in an EEG prior to their enrolment 
into the baseline period. A drop seizure was defined as an attack or spell (atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic) 
involving the entire body, trunk or head that led or could have led to a fall, injury, slumping in a chair 
or hitting the patient's head on a surface. Patients must have been taking 1 or more AEDs at a dose 
which had been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and have documented failures on more 
than 1 AED. All medications or interventions for epilepsy (including ketogenic diet and vagus nerve 
stimulation [VNS]) must have been stable for 4 weeks prior to screening and the patient was willing to 
maintain a stable regimen throughout the trial. Patients and/or parent(s)/legal representative had 
satisfactorily completed the IVRS telephone diary on at least 25 days of the baseline period. Following 
the screening visit, a committee of independent experts reviewed a list of seizures experienced by the 
patients and would confirm the seizure types or request further information until an agreement was 
reached. 
Endpoints and analysis 
The predefined primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency. 
According to the epilepsy guideline (CHMP/EWP/566/98 Rev.2/Corr), the primary endpoint should 
dichotomise the data into responders/non-responders, where responders are patients who obtained at 
least a certain pre-defined percentage reduction of seizure frequency (e.g. a 50% reduction). In all 
pivotal studies, however, a continuous rather than a dichotomised variable was chosen as primary and 
the ≥ 50% responder rate was key secondary endpoint (in the EU submission). Considering the rarity 
of the condition, the choice of primary and key secondary endpoints as well as the hierarchical 
approach to control the type I error is acceptable.  The drop seizures are frequent in LGS patients, are 
associated with high morbidity and mortality in this population, responsible for most injuries associated 
with falls, and that they are easily identified by parents and caregivers. Based on this it is considered 
that the drop seizures bear a high burden of disease in LGS patients and the CHMP agreed that 
measuring the frequency of drop seizure can be considered a clinically relevant endpoint for LGS 
patients.  
There were 3 prospectively defined key secondary endpoints: (1) the proportion of patients who 
achieved ≥ 50% reduction in drop seizures (responder analysis); (2) the percentage change from 
baseline in total seizure frequency; and (3) the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change 
(S/CGIC) at last visit. These endpoints were tested hierarchically in the above order following analysis 
of the primary endpoint. In trial GWEP1414 (including also a 10 mg/kg/day dose), the primary 
endpoint was tested first by comparing the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group with the placebo group, then 
by comparing the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group with the placebo group. Given statistical significance at 
both doses, the key secondary endpoints were then tested, first by comparing the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-

OS group with the placebo group for each endpoint, and then by comparing the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS 
group with the placebo group for each endpoint.  
Dravet Syndrome (Study GWEP1332B and GWEP1424) 
Patient population 
Patients had to be aged 2-18 years with a clinical diagnosis of Dravet Syndrome confirmed by a 
committee of independent experts, and had to have experienced 4 or more convulsive seizures during 
the 4-week baseline period. A convulsive seizure was defined as a tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic, or atonic 
seizure. Patients must have been taking 1 or more AEDs at a dose which had been stable for at least 4 
weeks prior to screening. Patients and/or parent(s)/legal representative had satisfactorily completed 
the IVRS telephone diary on at least 25 days of the baseline period. Following the screening visit, a 
committee of independent experts reviewed a list of seizures experienced by the patients and would 
confirm the seizure types or request further information until an agreement was reached. 
Children below 2 years of age were not included contrary to advice given by the CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/3106/1/2015/PA/PED/III). Dravet syndrome initiates during the first year of life. Different 
types of seizures appear soon after disease onset, the seizures are often particularly difficult to control, 
and a number of anti-epileptic drugs may have been already tried and failed before a child reaches the 
age of 2 years. Furthermore, in accordance with RMP, data in children < 2 years is identified as 
missing data to its relevance for Dravet patients. In order to address this concern, the applicant 
proposed to develop an updated PBPK model which will be available in the first quarter of 2020. The 
investigation into potential sampling techniques for very young patients has been initiated and when 
results are available, this will be applied to any trials involving patients under 2 years of age (further 
details available in the clinical pharmacology discussion section). The CHMP agreed that the proposed 
plan would appropriately address the need to generate further data in patient under 2 years of age in 
order to characterize the efficacy and safety profile in this patient population. 
The SCN1A genotype was determined in most patients, and most patients tested had a mutation. This 
finding reflects the available epidemiological data. Moreover, the applicant performed subgroup 
analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints which showed that the efficacy of CBD-OS was 
not influenced by SCN1A mutation type.  
Endpoints and analysis 
The primary endpoint for study GWEP1332B was the percentage change from baseline in convulsive 
seizure frequency (average per 28 days) during the treatment period for CBD-OS compared with 
placebo.  The primary endpoint for study GWEP1424 was the change in convulsive seizure frequency 
during the treatment period compared to baseline in patients taking CBD-OS compared with placebo. A 
convulsive seizure was defined as a tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic, or atonic seizure. Convulsive seizures are 
accurately identified by caregivers and are the most common observable motor component in DS. The 
CHMP agreed that measuring the frequency of convulsive seizure can be considered a clinically 
relevant endpoint for DS patients. A continuous variable rather than a dichotomised variable 
(responder analysis) was chosen due to the rareness of DS. For the purpose of the EU submission the 
≥ 50% responder rate was the key secondary endpoint in Study GWEP1332B which is considered 
acceptable. For the EU submission only, the secondary endpoints in Study GWEP1332B were tested 
hierarchically, starting with the key secondary endpoint followed by all other secondary endpoints. For 
submissions outside the EU, there was no hierarchical testing of secondary endpoints. In Study 
GWEP1424 (submitted as part of the Day150 responses of the current EU procedure), a hierarchical 
gate-keeping procedure was used to control the type I error starting with the primary endpoint for the 
20 mg/kg/day dose followed by the 10 mg/kg/day dose, then the 1st key secondary endpoint for the 
20 mg/kg/day dose etc.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint was met in all four studies with an approximately 40-50% median reduction in 
the active groups as compared to approximately 15-25% in the placebo groups. Whereas it is 
questionable whether a median treatment difference of 20-25% may in itself be considered clinically 
relevant, in the LGS studies the primary analysis was supported by key secondary analyses including 
responder analyses and global impression of change. In terms of drop seizure free days, the treatment 
difference in LGS corresponded to 3-5 drop seizure free days per 28 days. In Dravet Syndrome, the 
key secondary endpoint (responder analysis) was not met in Study GWEP1332B. In Study GWEP1424, 
the key secondary endpoint analyses supported the primary analyses.  
The two syndromes LGS and DS are both considered epileptic encephalopathies, are high frequency 
seizure disorders comprised of multiple seizure types, share many of the same seizure types, are 
highly treatment refractory and they are to some degree treated with same medications.  Morbidity 
and mortality are high in both disorders, and SUDEP is a common cause of death at a young age.  
However, the syndromes differ in age of onset and aetiology: Dravet Syndrome is usually associated 
with SCN1A mutations, and may likely be considered a sodium channel disorder, whereas SCN1A 
mutations are usually not seen in LGS. Thus, there is not a clear biological rationale for expecting 
rather similar effect sizes in the two indications. While the finding of rather similar effect sizes may be 
a consequence of CBD-OS having unspecific anticonvulsive properties the methodological and 
pharmacokinetic issues discussed in this report may also play a role. 
In all pivotal studies, the efficacy analyses relied on the caregiver's judgment and correct entry of 
seizure information in the IVRS. Dealing with missing data in seizure frequency trials is challenging due 
to the average over a given period being used. Furthermore, as seizure 'rater', the caregiver was not 
blinded to other clinical information regarding e.g. adverse events, dose reductions, behaviour, and the 
general well-being of the patient, meaning that rating might be influenced by these factors. During the 
procedure the applicant submitted the results of several analyses investigating the correlation between 
the occurrence of AE (such as somnolence, sedation, lethargy or fatigue Decreased appetite or 
diarrhoea) and treatment effects. The presented results suggested that there is no association to a 
modest association between seizure reduction and occurrence of AEs which are representative for 
CBD-OS safety profile. Based on the provided analyse the CHMP concluded that while it cannot be 
excluded that the unblinding occurred in few cases, the underreporting of seizures by the caregiver and 
the patient’s behaviour were unlikely to be impacted by unblinding. Overall the impact of any potential 
unblinding cases on the robustness of the presented data is not considered relevant.  
At least some of the treatment difference may likely be ascribed to the bi-directional pharmacokinetic 
interaction with clobazam (leading to increased clobazam active metabolite N-CLB concentrations and 
to increased CBD active metabolite 7-OH-CBD concentrations). CBD-OS and clobazam have a complex 
2-way metabolic interaction. CBD-OS inhibits CYP2C19 which is required to metabolise the active 
clobazam metabolite N-CLB. This leads to 2 to 4 fold increase in N-CLB and an approximate 1.5-fold 
increase in 7-OH-CBD concentrations, which may partially explain the treatment difference. In the 
pivotal trials there was substantial clobazam concomitant treatment at baseline (approximately 50% in 
LGS and 65% in DS). The Applicant performed various analyses intended to demonstrate independent 
efficacy of CBD-OS. However, in the 20 mg/kg/day dose level in both LGS studies, in one DS study at 
the 20 mg/kg/day and in the other DS study at the 10 mg/kg/day, performing the primary analysis on 
the subgroup of patients on CLB and the subgroup of patients not on CLB consistently revealed much 
larger treatment difference point estimates in the CLB subgroups than in the non-CLB subgroups.  
At the CHMP’s request the applicant was invited to discuss the clinical relevance of the efficacy of CBD-
OS independent of clobazam with particular focus on results obtained with the intended maintenance 
dose (10 mg/kg/day). This dose level was only investigated in two studies: GWEP1414 (LGS) and 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 149/190 
 
GWEP1424 (DS). In DS, a marked difference (primary endpoint) between the on-CLB (treatment ratio 
0.63) and off-CLB (treatment ratio 0.91) subgroups was observed for the 10 mg/kg/day dose in 
accordance with what was observed in DS study GWEP1332B for the 20 mg/kg/day dose (In DS study 
GWEP1424, the 20 mg/kg/day dose off-CLB showed a treatment ratio of 0.80). In LGS, such a 
difference was not observed for the 10 mg/kg/day dose in study GWEP1414 (treatment ratio on-CLB 
0.70, treatment ratio off-CLB 0.71), whereas a marked difference was observed for the 20 mg/kg/day 
dose in both LGS studies. The overall impression when looking across both dose levels and both 
diseases is that the treatment effect (seizure frequency reduction, primary endpoint) is far larger in the 
on-CLB subgroups (treatment ratios of 0.46-0.70) than in the off-CLB subgroups (treatment ratios of 
0.71-0.92) with the confidence intervals for the off-CLB subgroups generally overlapping unity (a 
treatment ratio of 1, indicating no effect). 
In order to demonstrate that the treatment effect off-CLB is different from zero, the applicant 
performed meta-analyses across diseases and doses. The meta-analyses were stratified by trial, which 
is agreed. For patients not taking clobazam (10 mg/kg/day dose), the meta-analyses suggest a 
reduction, albeit not statistically significant, in seizure counts of approximately 22 % (95 % CI 0 % - 
40 %). The meta-analyses are considered helpful although several strong assumptions are made. The 
diseases are not as such comparable, the primary endpoints are different (addressing different seizure 
types), and efficacy of the 10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day doses - although of comparable 
magnitude - cannot be considered identical. Despite these limitations, the meta-analyses do indicate 
that the treatment effect off-CLB is smaller than the treatment effect in patients on clobazam.  
In order to explain the lack of - or smaller magnitude of - treatment effect in patients not taking 
clobazam, the applicant noted that there are likely multiple factors involved, one being that these 
patients have previously tried clobazam without success and may therefore as a group be considered 
more difficult to treat. However, this explanation was developed after seeing the results and is 
therefore prone to bias.  In addition, while there are differences in baseline clinical characteristics 
between these subgroups the two patient subpopulations do not appear to be fundamentally different. 
Furthermore, the fact that patients off CLB in LGS have a higher risk of experiencing an increase in 
seizures at 20 mg/kg/day may merely be interpreted as lack of efficacy. It is neither meaningful nor 
methodologically valid to consider a decrease on a scale as proof of efficacy but an increase on the 
same scale as an adverse event (rather than a lack of efficacy).  
Thus, while a small favourable effect of CBD-OS independent of clobazam cannot be excluded, its 
clinical relevance was not established. The Applicant argued that clinical relevance of CBD treatment, 
in these rare and severe treatment resistant epileptic encephalopathies can be gleaned from the 
results of the 50% responder analyses, however based on the discussion of the SAG (see Additional 
expert consultation section), the view from CHMP is that the primary efficacy analyses should be used 
to determine clinical relevance.  
In the CHMP’s view the pharmacokinetic interaction between CBD-OS and CLB remains the most likely 
explanation for the observed difference in efficacy between the ON-CLB and OFF-CLB subgroups. 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that based on the available data CBD-OS efficacy appears to be driven 
by results obtained in patients on clobazam although CBD-OS may have some small efficacy 
independent of clobazam.  
The clinical relevance of this smaller effect in patients not receiving clobazam was subject of discussion 
in a Scientific Advisory Group (see the minutes under the heading Additional expert consultation). 
Overall, the SAG was not convinced that efficacy of clobazam had been reliably demonstrated in 
statistical terms. Notwithstanding this, the group consisting of experts in the field, were split in the 
interpretation of the clinical relevance of the observed effect of CBD-OS without clobazam. 
Approximately half of the group did not consider the observed effect clinically relevant whereas the 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 150/190 
 
other half did indeed consider the effect clinically relevant. The experts who considered the effect 
clinically relevant also considered results from responder analyses as supportive of the clinical 
relevance.  The SAG did not consider that data supported the company’s claim that the observed 
smaller effect of CBD-OS in patients off clobazam was due to these patients constituting a particularly 
treatment-resistant subgroup.  
Whereas the presented study results demonstrated that CBD-OS had a statistically significant effect in 
the studied LGS and DS populations, the effect size appeared mainly driven by the effect size observed 
in clobazam-treated patients whereas in patients off clobazam the effect size was small. Given these 
concerns which were partly shared by the SAG members, the CHMP does not consider that it has been 
convincingly demonstrated that the effect size in patients off clobazam is statistically and clinically 
relevant.  
Patients in the open-label extension (OLE) study experienced a reduction in seizure frequency 
compared to pivotal trial baseline values. The median reductions were comparable in magnitude with 
that observed in the pivotal trial active groups. According to the Applicant, this demonstrates 
maintenance of efficacy. To account for differences in sample size with increasing time, the Applicant 
also analysed the subgroups of patients treated for 37-48 weeks, and found similar results. However, 
both analyses are subject to selection bias and thus in the CHMP’s view do not necessarily reflect 
maintenance of efficacy. 
Patients included in the Expanded Access Program (EAP) experienced a median reduction in seizure 
frequency comparable in magnitude with that observed in the pivotal trial active groups. Given the 
uncontrolled nature of the programme and the high likelihood of selection bias, CHMP considers that no 
firm conclusions can be drawn based on these data. 
Additional expert consultation 
In the course of the procedure, the CHMP identified the need for expert input and thus a scientific 
advisory group expert meeting was convened, which included the participation of patient 
representatives, on the following questions: 
1. The results of all four pivotal studies conducted in LGS and DS patients indicate a smaller 
magnitude of the effect in patients not treated with clobazam.  The SAG is asked to discuss 
the importance of these findings, in particular:  
a.  Please discuss if the results observed in the subgroup of patients off clobazam 
treatment show a clinically relevant effect 
Overall, SAG experts expressed doubts about the validity of the efficacy data and were not fully 
convinced that they are reliably demonstrating an effect in patients OFF-clobazam treatment, mainly, 
from a statistical point of view. 
However, experts were split in their interpretation of the clinical relevance of the effect.  
Some considered that for both LGS and DS patients the clinical relevance of the demonstrated effect in 
PEP and responder analysis was not sufficiently shown in patients off clobazam. 
Others clearly stated that despite the size of the observed effect some consistency of the effect across 
available studies should be acknowledged, indicating some clinical relevance. For these experts, if data 
were to be considered reliable, the observed effect in patients OFF-clobazam would be considered 
clinically important (a 30% reduction of seizure numbers in LGS for example and a 1/3 of patients 
achieving more than 50% reduction is clearly clinically relevant).  
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 151/190 
 
Some experts made a statement that in the field of paediatric rare epilepsies, the type of trial as 
performed for this application may not be fully suited to register all the aspects that would constitute 
clinically meaningful efficacy in real life. They insisted that in this specific type of situation, registration 
of seizure numbers or other “standard” endpoints often fail to reflect the full range of benefits that 
could be important to the patients and caregivers.  
b.  Please discuss the apparent discrepancy between the results of the primary 
efficacy analysis (reduction in seizure frequency) and the results of the 50% 
responder analysis. In that respect, the SAG experts are asked to discuss 
which endpoint can be considered of primary interest in terms of establishing 
the clinical relevance of the effect.  
It was pointed out that the Applicant made the choice to use the reduction of seizure frequency as 
primary endpoint, instead of responder analysis. The SAG experts were once again split, with majority 
(including patient representatives) favoring the clinical importance of reduction of seizure frequency, 
while others commented that the >50% response rate is more clinically relevant in these specific 
conditions. However, some experts questioned the relevance of a ≥50% reduction of a single type of 
seizure, when both LGS and DS patients present with many other types of seizures. 
c.  Please discuss the claim (based on the presented data for previous use of 
clobazam in a significant proportion of the patients not receiving clobazam in 
the trials) that patients off clobazam represent a specific treatment resistant 
subgroup, explaining at least partly the apparent smaller efficacy observed in 
this subgroup of patients. 
The SAG experts considered that there are not enough data to support the claim that patients OFF-
clobazam represent a specific treatment resistant subgroup.  
2. The results observed in patients not taking clobazam may have been impacted by the 
effects observed in a subset of patients experiencing worsening of seizure frequency which 
to some extent decrease the positive effect on seizure frequency observed in the majority of 
patients. The applicant has proposed that in clinical practice this can be managed by early 
discontinuation of CBD-OS in patients experiencing worsening of seizure frequency and 
continuing CBD-OS treatment in patients with a favorable response, only.  In that respect, 
the SAG experts are asked to discuss the feasibility and clinical utility of such an approach 
taking into consideration the known risks associated with CBD-OS treatment. 
The experts were convinced that these patients are managed by a highly specialized group of 
physicians, and normally a warning will be introduced in any new anti-epileptic drug, so any worsening 
will be registered and can be managed in clinical practice by withdrawing the patient from the 
treatment.  
The patient representatives supported adding a clear warning about the potential worsening while on 
treatment with the product, since there is the perception in the patient community that this is a 
“natural” product and hence should not be expected to have any negative effects. This perception will 
potentially affect the reports of worsening that may come from the parents and caregivers.  
3. The SAG experts are asked to discuss which precautions (if any) are considered necessary 
in order to minimize the treatment risks taking into consideration not only the risk of 
worsening of seizure frequency but also the other identified risks associated with CBD-OS  
(in particular sedation and hepatotoxicity). 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 152/190 
 
The SAG expressed concerns about the small proportion of patients that will experience status 
epilepticus and will have to be treated for that. It is not clear how the observed toxicological effects of 
CBD may interact with the known toxicity of the drugs used to manage status epilepticus.  
Another concern expressed was related to the rescue use of midazolam and the potential effect on 
respiratory depression in these patients. The applicant should clarify whether such interaction has been 
observed.  
4. The SAG experts are asked to comment on the clinical utility and the effect in practice of a 
potential restriction of use of CBD-OS only to patients already receiving clobazam as part of 
their therapy. 
SAG experts were split in their position about an indication that clearly excludes OFF clobazam 
patients. Although it was considered that data in OFF-clobazam patients could indicate efficacy, no 
consensus could be reached regarding a restricted indication to this specific group. 
Some members supported this restricted indication, which should be based on the evidence provided 
by the trials. Additionally, they expressed concerns that a different approach will increase the use of 
CBD instead of clobazam. However, the argument that CBD will then be prescribed off-label, even if 
the current level of evidence does not support this, was not considered a valid argument to have an 
indication for patients OFF-clobazam in the absence of proven efficacy. 
Other experts, including the patient representatives, were against a restriction, stating the following 
reasons: 
•  Such an indication will require the use of clobazam in order to prescribe CBD, thus patients 
who cannot tolerate clobazam (often observed in children) will not be given the option to use 
CBD for treatment. This situation was highlighted by the patient representatives as 
undesirable.  
• 
• 
It is likely that a restricted indication may not be followed in practice – it will potentiate off-
label use 
Individual patients may still exist that will show clinically relevant benefit and having an 
additional effective treatment option is appreciated. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Dravet Syndrome, two serious, rare, treatment 
resistant epileptic encephalopathies, was evaluated in four pivotal trials in which the primary outcome 
measure was reduction in drop seizure frequency and convulsive seizure frequency, respectively. These 
are considered clinically relevant endpoints. The primary endpoint was met in all four studies with an 
approximately 40-50% median reduction of seizure frequency in the active groups as compared to 
approximately median 15-25% in the placebo groups. In Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the primary 
analysis was supported by the statistically significant results of key secondary endpoints including 
responder analyses and global impression of change. In terms of drop seizure free days, the treatment 
difference in LGS corresponded to 3-5 drop seizure free days per 28 days. In Dravet Syndrome, the 
key secondary endpoint (responder analysis) was not met in one study (GWEP1332B) whereas in the 
other study (GWEP1424) the key secondary analyses reached the statistical significance, supporting 
the results of the primary analyses.  
Whereas the presented studies demonstrated that CBD-OS had an effect in both LGS and DS, the 
effect appeared mainly driven by the effect observed in clobazam treated patients whereas the effect 
in patients off clobazam was smaller or not detectable. The CHMP does not consider that it has been

convincingly demonstrated that the effect size in off clobazam LGS and DS patients treated with other 
combined treatments is statistically and clinically relevant, hence that it does not support the indication 
initially claimed with any kind of drug combination. 
Therefore, the CHMP considers that the presented efficacy data supports the application for Epidyolex 
in the treatment of use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
(LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in conjunction with clobazam only, for patients 2 years of age and 
older. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data to support the use of CBD-OS in patients with LGS or DS has been collected from 8 
completed Phase 1 trials, 4 completed double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in target indications (2 
trials in LGS and 2 trials in DS), and 1 ongoing Phase 3 OLE trial. Supportive data was also collected 
from the EAP (investigator-initiated IND applications [US]) and other compassionate use programs 
(i.e., State INDs [US] and CAS [Australia]) in patients with DREs. Supportive safety data from 
additional Phase 1 clinical pharmacology trials, trials in other patient populations with epilepsy, and 
trials in other exploratory indications are presented by trial in CSRs/interim synoptic reports (ISRs) 
only. 
Patient exposure 
The  2  target  patient  populations  for  this  marketing  application  (LGS  and  DS)  are  complex,  with  both 
having seizures that are inadequately controlled despite their current AED regimen (multiple adjunctive 
AEDs combined for treatment).  
The data from the LGS and DS RCTs and open-label trials have been pooled and presented together to 
provide a larger safety dataset to aid risk identification. In the Pool DS/LGS, 456 patients were 
exposed to CBD-OS and 292 patients were exposed to placebo, representing 113.55 and 78.34 
patient-years on treatment, respectively. In OLE trial, GWEP1415, a total of 278 patients in 
GWEP1415-DS and 366 patients in GWEP1415-LGS received CBD-OS, which represented 252.76 and 
385.39 patient years on treatment, respectively. 
Additional supportive safety data are available from 322 patients exposed to CBD-OS in a dose range 
of 200 mg to 6000 mg in phase I studies in healthy subjects and patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment. Further safety data are available from an expanded access and compassionate use 
programs among patient with a serious or life-threatening condition with no other comparable or 
satisfactory therapeutic options and from smaller studies in other patient groups.  
Overall as of the cut-off dates, 1928 unique subjects have been exposed to CBD-OS in GW-sponsored 
development programs. An additional 68 unique subjects have been exposed to CBD capsules and 12 
unique subjects have been exposed to CBD i.v. solution.

Table 40 Overall Summary of CBD-OS exposures in the clinical development and 
supportive programs 
Since the indications of LGS and DS are early onset epilepsies, the patient populations were 
predominantly aged ≤ 18 years old. In the LGS trials, approximately 30% of the patients were aged ≥

18 years old. In the DS trials, approximately 30% of the patients were < 6 years old, and all patients 
were ≤ 18 years old. The mean age and mean weight of patients in the All CBD-OS group of Pool LGS 
(15.6 years; 42.7 kg) was older and heavier than that in Pool DS (9.2 years; 32.7 kg), which is 
reflective of the age differences in the overall patient populations included in the trials. 
Table 41 - Disposition by Age in controlled DS and LGS trials (Pool DS/LGS) 
Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAS): 
• 
In the phase II and phase III controlled clinical trials 
There were more TEAS in the CBD-OS treated groups than in the placebo groups. There were more 
TEAS in the 20 mg/kg/day than the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups. The TEAS in the DS and LGS pools 
were similar except for a few SOCs mentioned below.  
Most commonly reported adverse events were within:  
- The SOC ‘Nervous system disorders’, including somnolence, lethargy, sedation, drooling and tremor.  
- The SOC ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’, including diarrhoea, vomiting.   
- The SOC ‘Metabolism’, including decreased appetite.  
 -The SOC ‘Investigations’, including changes in the levels of hepatic enzymes. 
In the CBD-OS treated LGS group four subjects had recorded cardiac disorders of tachycardia (II), 
arrhythmia (I) and bradycardia (I) as compared to one subject in the placebo group. As no CBD-OS 
treated subjects with DS had similar changes of rhythm, and as the reported incidence/prevalence is 
fairly comparable to the background prevalence, it is less likely to be related to CBD. 
The following table summarises the most frequently reported AEs during controlled DS and LGS trials:

In the open-label extension study (OLE) 
In general, the adverse event profile in the OLE study resembled the adverse events profile observed 
in the clinical phase II and phase III trials. Hence, somnolence, lethargy, sedation, decreased appetite

and increasing levels of hepatic enzymes were also noted in the OLE study. Decreased weight, which 
may be caused by reduced appetite or gastrointestinal adverse events, was also noted.  Further, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation are frequently reported adverse events. There were also four 
reports of changed cardiac rhythm, as also noted in the CBD-OS treated LGS group in the phase III 
trials.

OLE extension trial GWEP1415 (GWEP1415-DS/LGS by modal dose) 
1. Liver related adverse events: 
When  combining  the  patient  populations  in  Pool  DS/LGS,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  meeting  the  search 
criteria  for  AESI  abnormal  liver  TEAEs  was  14.9%  in  the  All  CBD-OS  group  (N=456)  compared  with 
3.1%  in  the  placebo  group  (N=292).  The  overall  AESI  incidence  was  higher  in  the  CBD-OS  20 
mg/kg/day  group  (17.6%;  N=307)  than  the  10  mg/kg/day  dose  group  (9.4%;  N=139).  The  3  most 
common AESI PTs were ALT increased, AST increased, and GGT increased. 
Overall,  the  incidence  of  AESI  abnormal  liver  TEAEs  in  the  OLE  trial  was  similar  to  that  seen  in  the 
controlled trials (18.6% vs. 14.9%, respectively), with no evidence of new patterns of AEs (the 3 most 
common AESI PTs were ALT increased, AST increased, and GGT increased)

A. Transaminase elevations and levels of bilirubin + INR: 
CBD-OS dose dependently increased the risk of liver enzyme primarily related to transaminase 
elevations. 
The  majority  of  the  increases  were  below  3  x  ULN.  However,  patients  with  greater  than  3  x  ULN 
elevation in transaminases showed a clear dose-response relationship with clearly increased risk for 20 
mg/kg/day whereas the risk for 10 mg/kg/day was comparable to that of placebo.  
The risk of elevations of transaminases was increased in patients with elevated transaminases before 
treatment and particularly in that receiving valproic acid. In patients not receiving valproic acid, there 
was  a  small  increase  in  risk  of  any  elevation  of  transaminases.  However,  there  were  no  changes 
greater than 5xULN although the number of patients with elevated transaminases and no concomitant 
valproic  acid  treatment  was  too  low  to  allow  a  definite  conclusion  but  did  not  suggest  and  increased 
risk. Baseline transaminase use and concomitant valproate treatment synergistically increased the risk 
of  CBD-OS  to induce  post-baseline  hepatocellular  injury.  Concomitant  use  of clobazam  also increased 
the incidence of transaminase elevations, although to a much lesser extent than valproate.  
In  controlled  trials,  27  patients  were  reported  with  ALT-elevations  >  5  x  ULN.  The  majority  of  these 
patients  received  20  mg/kg/day  of  CBD-OS  (22/27)  and  were  concomitantly  treated  with  valproate 
(23/27).  Ten  participants  had  SAE  or  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  of  the  study  while  seventeen 
patients  with  ALT-elevations  >  5  x  ULN  remained  on  the  study.  During  the  OLE  phase,  19  patients 
were reported with ALT-elevations > 5 x ULN, most of them treated with Placebo during the controlled 
phase but at high-doses (20-30mg/kg/d) during OLE phase and receiving VPA (16/19). 
Most  cases  of  ALT  elevation  occurred  within  the  first  30  days  of  use.  However,  there  were  also  a 
number  of  cases  commencing  more  than  30  days  after  initiation  of  treatment  stressing  the  need  for 
continuous  monitoring  of  liver  enzymes  throughout  treatment.  Some  cases,  particularly  those  also 
treated with VPA occurred as late as after 6 to 18 months after treatment initiation in controlled trials. 
Similar pattern was found on the OLE group.

B. Frequencies of liver-related AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations: 
CBD-OS dose dependently increased the risk of liver related adverse events. In controlled studies there 
was one case of acute hepatic failure (SAE), one case of hepatic failure (non-serious per investigator) 
and  one  case  of  hepatotoxicity.  All  liver  related  AEs  occurred  in  patients  taking  CBD-OS  at 
20mg/kg/day as add-on therapy to VPA (hepatic failures) or clobazam (hepatotoxicity). Acute hepatic 
failures lead to discontinuation.  
The patient reported to have an SAE of ‘acute hepatic failure’ had an AST elevation preceded by fever 
and vomiting and experienced abdominal pain during the elevation. The lab values of peak AST of 4.6 
× ULN, ALT of 1.6 × ULN, bilirubin of 1.1 × ULN, and INR = 1.09.  
The  patient  was  reported  to  have  recovered  from  this  event.    The  other  patient  for  whom  an  AE  of 
‘hepatic failure’ was reported had no related symptoms and had results for peak ALT (3.1 × ULN), AST 
(1.4 × ULN), normal bilirubin (0.5 × ULN) and INR = 0.98. The patient was reported to have recovered 
from this event. 
2. CNS related adverse events: 
A. Somnolence, lethargy, sedation 
In  the  controlled  studies,  The  CBD-OS  treatment  led  to  somnolence,  lethargy,  and  sedation  in  a 
substantial number of participants (First table in Safety). The potential mode of action causing was not 
clarified by the applicant. At request, the applicant presented results that provide evidence that these 
AEs  were  mostly  transient  and  unrelated  with  age.  Less  than  2%  of  cases  were  classified  as  SAE, 
serious AE or AE leading to treatment discontinuation.   
B. Psychiatric Disorders 
In the controlled studies, an increase in irritability (5.5%) and aggression (3.9%) as non-serious non-
severe AE was noted in a non-dose dependency pattern (First table in Safety). These adverse events 
occurred mainly within the two first weeks in CBD-OS treated patients. Patients experienced agitation 
and  abnormal  behaviour  but  no  hallucination  or  psychosis.  More  importantly,  there  was  not  a  dose-
response relationship between CBD and the occurrence of these AE, and no patients discontinued due 
to these AE.  
C. Cognition 
As patients with DS and LGS often have reduced cognitive abilities, cognitive tests were performed in a 
relatively small proportion of the entire safety population and no firm conclusion could be drawn about 
the possible negative impact of CBD-OS on cognition.   
D. Suicidality 
No TEAEs related to suicidality (ideation or actual attempts) were reported in the 456 patients exposed 
to CBD-OS in the controlled DS or LGS trials or in the 644 patients exposed to CBD-OS in the OLE trial 
GWEP1415. In EAP (N=684), 2 patients had TEAEs  meeting the search criteria for AESI suicidality: 1 
patient (0.3%) in the CBD-OS > 20–30 mg/kg/day group (N=379) had TEAEs of suicidal ideation and 
suicidal behaviour and 1 patient (1.3%) in the CBD-OS > 40 mg/kg/day group (N=75) had a TEAE of 
suicidal  ideation.  Both  patients  had  TEAEs  after  14  weeks  on  treatment  ().  Both  patients  had  TEAEs 
that were considered severe and serious 
E. Abuse liability 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 163/190 
 
 
At  request,  the  Applicant  provided  results  supporting  that  the  CNS  concentrations  were  likely  not 
enough  to  induce  euphoria,  even  in  the  case  of  concomitant  use  of  cannabis  for  therapeutic  or 
recreational purposes. Moreover, there was no difference in placebo vs. CBD-OS in reported AE-related 
abuse liability. 
F. Seizure worsening 
The  percentage  of  patients  who  experienced  seizure  worsening  may  have  been  slightly  higher  in  the 
CBD-OS  groups  (57.54  cases  per  100  PY) than  in  the  placebo group  (better 53.30  cases  per  100PY). 
There was not an increased risk of statues epilepticus in patients treated with CBD-OS as compared to 
placebo group (First table in Safety). 
3. Adverse events of other organ systems 
A. Diarrhoea, decreased appetite, body weight and BMI 
The  incidence  of  AESI  diarrhea  in  Pool  DS/LGS  was  18.2%  in  the  All  CBD-OS  group  compared  with 
9.6%  in  the  placebo  group.  The  incidence  in  the  CBD-OS  20  mg/kg/day  group  (21.2%)  was  higher 
than  that  in  the  10  mg/kg/day  group  (12.9%)  The  incidence  of  AESI  decreased  appetite  in  Pool 
DS/LGS was 21.1% in the All CBD-OS group compared with 7.5% in the placebo group (First table in 
Safety).  Compared  to  placebo,  CBD-OS  was  associated  with  a  smaller  increase  in  mean  body  weight 
suggesting a slight impairment of weight gain in these growing children. However, no clear differences 
between  CBD-OS  and  placebo  were  observed  as  regards  BMI  or  Z-score  during  the  relatively  short 
phase  3  trials  with  regards  to  these  measures.  In  the  controlled  studies,  the  incidences  of  both  AE 
were higher for patients treated with VPA in placebo and particularly in the all CBD-OS group.

B. Rash and DRESS syndrome 
In the controlled trials, rash was noted as AE in 5.2% of patients in in the 20 mg/kg/day group and 
2.2% in the 10 mg/kg/day group while those in placebo had 1%. Although the mechanism is not fully 
understood, there CBD-OS treatment may lead to rash. At request, the Applicant clarified that DRESS 
did not occur.

C. Urinary retention 
In  controlled  trials,  urinary  retention  was  reported  as  AE  in  3.0%  and  2.1%  of  patients  treated  with 
10mg/kg/day  and  20  mg/kg/day,  respectively,  whereas  no  patient  treated  with  placebo  reported this 
AE. 
D. Vital signs 
Blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature showed no clinically relevant differences between the 
CBD-OS and placebo groups 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Fatal events in the phase III clinical trials 
During  GWEP1423,  patient  GWEP1423-V031  (CBD-OS  20  mg/kg/day)  experienced  convulsive  status 
epilepticus,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  aspiration  pneumonia,  acute  respiratory  failure  with 
hypoxia and hypercapnia, left renal calculus, deep vein thrombosis, pneumothorax (left and right) and 
subsequently  died.  Medical  conditions  at  screening  included  global  developmental  delays,  spastic 
quadriplegia,  pain  related to  feeding,  and  G-tube  use,  and  had  a  history  of  acute  respiratory  distress 
syndrome and pneumonia (resolved at screening). 
Fatal events in the OLE 
During the OLE phase, there were six fatal TEAEs.  
Patient narratives: 
•  Patient    in  group  CBD-OS  ≤  20  mg/kg/day  modal  dose  with    medical  history  of  DS,  lack  of  normal 
physiological  development,  autism  spectrum  disorder,  and  low  energy.  On  OLE  Day  230,  the  patient 
was found face down, apneic, and unresponsive in bed. It was reported that the patient had a normal 
day and ate lunch before going to bed for a rest. The working diagnosis was SUDEP.  
•  Patient  in  group  CBD-OS  ≤  20  mg/kg/day  modal  dose  with  medical  history  of  DS,  developmental 
delay.  On  OLE  Day  91,  the  patient  had  attended  a  routine  study  visit  and  appeared  well.  In  the 
morning of OLE Day 94, the patient was found dead in bed due to SUDEP (as per the death certificate).  
•  Patient  in  group  CBD-OS  ≤  20  mg/kg/day  modal  dose  with  medical  history  of  LGS,  gastrostomy, 
anoxic  brain  damage,  cerebral  palsy,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  failure  to  thrive,  feeding 
difficulties,  and  obstructive  sleep  apnoea  syndrome.  On  OLE  Day  29  the  patient  had  vomiting;  open-
label IMP was discontinued on this day. The patient subsequently developed difficulty breathing on OLE 
Day 30 with acute respiratory distress and shock. The patient was intubated due to acute respiratory 
failure  and  treated  for  pneumonia.  The  patient  started  to  wean  from  BiPAP  on  OLE  Day  42,  and 
completed  a  course  of  antibiotics  on  OLE  Day  43.  On  OLE  Day  45,  the  patient  vomited  and  had 
progressive respiratory distress during the evening. The patient died on OLE Day 47 due to respiratory 
failure, a complication of aspiration pneumonia.  
•  Patient  in  group  CBD-OS  ≤  20  mg/kg/day  modal  dose  with  medical  history  of  LGS,  chronic  lung 
disease,  aspiration  pneumonia,  microcephaly,  cortical  injury,  cerebral  palsy,  global  developmental 
delay,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  Nissen  fundoplication  and  repair,  gastrostomy,  vagal  nerve

stimulator  implantation,  and  obstructive  sleep  apnoea  syndrome.  On  OLE  Day  144,  the  patient  was 
found  to  have  severe  bowel  obstruction,  sepsis,  and  fever.  Emergency  surgery  found  necrotic  dead 
small bowel. The patient was unstable after surgery and subsequently died on OLE Day 145.  
•  Patient  in  groupCBD-OS  >  20  mg/kg/day  modal  dose  with  medical  history  of  LGS,  attention  deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, gastroesophageal reflux disease, developmental delay, MRSA, right craniotomy 
and  complete  corpus  callosotomy,  respiratory  distress  syndrome  in  the  newborn,  apnoea  of 
prematurity,  and  incontinence  of  faeces  and  urine.  On  OLE  Day  98,  the  patient  had  4  seizures  in the 
morning  before  being  taken  to  the  emergency  room,  and  was  diagnosed  with  respiratory  syncytial 
virus, reactive airway disease and decreased urinary output. On OLE Day 99, the patient was found in 
the morning to have passed away during sleep. 
 • Patient in group CBD-OS > 20 mg/kg/day modal dose with medical history of LGS, congenital right 
temporal  haemorrhage,  encephalopathy,  global  developmental  delay,  spastic  quadriparesis, 
gastrostomy tube placement, uncontrolled myoclonic seizures, uncontrolled tonic seizures, unwitnessed 
seizures when alone, and was microcephalic. Viral respiratory infection on OLE Day 54 and bronchiolitis 
on OLE Day 56. They recovered from the viral respiratory infection on OLE Day 58. On the morning of 
OLE Day 78, the patient was found dead. The cause of death was reported as complications of seizure 
disorder due to perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The death was classified as natural.  
EAP: 
Overall in Pool EAP, 12 patients (1.8%) died. The highest incidence of fatal TEAEs in Pool EAP was in 
the  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  SOC  (0.9%),  followed  by  the  Nervous  system 
disorders SOC (0.6%) and then the General disorders and administration site conditions SOC (0.4%). 
Serious adverse events 
Serious  adverse  events  occurred  more  commonly  in  the  CBD-OS  groups  than  in  the  placebo  groups. 
The  serious  adverse  events  were  increased  within  the  CNS-SOC,  infections-  and  infestations-SOC, 
investigations  (including 
liver-related  parameters),  respiratory-  and  general  disorders  SOCs, 
gastrointestinal- and metabolism and nutrition-SOC. The pattern of serious adverse events reflects the 
pattern of reported adverse events.

Laboratory findings 
In  the  RCT  and  the  OLE  trial,  mean  decreases  in  haematology  laboratory  values  over  time  were 
observed  across  the  LGS  and  DS  patient  populations.  However,  they  were  not  determined  to  be  of 
clinical significance. 
The increase in hepatic enzymes has been previously discussed together with liver-related AE.  
For  all  other  biochemistry  laboratory  such  as  creatinine  levels  values,  mean  changes  over  time  and 
potentially clinically significant laboratory abnormalities over time were similar for all treatment groups 
and across the LGS and DS patient populations observed in Pool DS/LGS

Age  
Adverse events according to age: 
Table  49  Incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  and  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  by  age 
group in controlled DS andLGS trials (pool DS/LGS) 
The  risk  of  any  TEAE  and  any  TEAE  leading  to  discontinuation  of  was  higher  for  CBD-OS  than  for 
placebo in all age groups. The risk was higher in the younger age groups than in the older age groups 
Gender 
The  population  of  each  trial  comprised  between  52%  and  57%  male  and  43%–48%  female  patients. 
There were no marked differences in outcome between male and female patients.   
Weight 
CBD-OS  is  dosed  according  to  weight,  i.e.  10  mg/kg/day  or  20  mg/kg/day.  Hence,  there  were  no 
differences between treatment groups due to weight of patients. 
DS and LGS 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019

Overall, there were no differences in the CBD-OS safety profile between DS and LGS patients.  
Race or region 
Mainly  Caucasians  were  included,  i.e.  White/Caucasian  88–90%.  Differences  according  to  race  and 
genetic polymorphism are unknown.  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No studies have been conducted in pregnant or lactating women 
Impaired renal or liver function 
A  phase  I  study  was  conducted  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  (mild,  moderate,  severe)  or  impaired 
liver  (mild,  moderate,  severe)  function.  No  safety  issues  were  observed in  this  study.  However,  from 
the  phase  II/III  studies  it is  evident that  CBD  is  hepatotoxic  and  that the  severity  of  the  hepatotoxic 
effect  is  increased  in  patients  with  impaired  liver  function  at  baseline  (please  refer  to  the  section  of 
liver-related adverse events).  
Immunological events 
Rash,  presumably  a  Type  IV  hypersensitivity  reaction,  was  observed  in  approx.  1%  of  the  CBD-OS 
treated population as compared to none in the placebo group.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug  interactions  have  been  investigated  in  the  PK-section  of  this  AR.  Further,  valproate 
increased the hepatotoxicity of CBD (please refer to assessment of liver-related adverse events)   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  more  common  among  CBD-OS  treated  patients  compared  to 
placebo  treated  patients.  Elevated  liver  enzymes  were  the  leading  cause  of  discontinuation  but 
gastrointestinal  disorders  and  nervous  system  disorders  were  also  common  reasons 
for 
discontinuation.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database is considered sufficiently large considering that DS and LGS are orphan diseases. 
It includes 456 DS and LGS patients (DS;N=221 and LGS;N=235) patients from four pivotal Phase III

studies.  Additionally,  27  DS  patients  from  a  phase  II  study  and  630  patients  in  the  open-label 
extension, OLE, study. Of the 630 patients in the OLE, 353 had not previously been exposed to CBD-
OS.  
In  the  phase  3  clinical  trials  the  patient  years  of  exposure  to  CBD-OS  10  mg/kg/day  were  36.26  PY 
while  exposure  to  20  mg/kg/day  was  76.45  PY.  Additional  supportive  safety  data  are  available  from 
322 patients exposed to CBD-OS in a dose range of 200 mg to 6000 mg in phase I studies in healthy 
subjects  and  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment.  Further  safety  data  are  available  from  an 
expanded  access  and  compassionate  use  programs  among  patient  with  a  serious  or  life-threatening 
condition  with  no  other  comparable  or  satisfactory  therapeutic  options  and  from  smaller  studies  in 
other patient groups. In total, 1928 patients have been exposed to CBD-OS.  
However, exact exposure to CBD-OS in patients is unknown, since the uptake of CBD-OS is increased 
by  a  factor  of  four,  if  administered  with  food.  Yet,  the  study  protocols  did  not  instruct  the 
caregivers/patients  to  take  CBD-OS  with  meals.  Consequently,  the  participants  may  have  been 
exposed to different amounts of CBD-OS depending  on whether they administered CBD-OS with  food 
or not. Nevertheless, the available data show an overall positive relationship between the administered 
dose and observed number and severity of adverse events. This supports that in individual children a 
gradual increase of CBD-OS will lead to a gradually increasing risk of emerging safety events or of the 
severity  of  safety  events.  Hence,  under  conditions  of  a  sufficient  safety-monitoring  schedule  and  a 
gradual  increase  of  CBD-OS  dose  given  consistently  with  or  without  a  meal,  specific  emerging  safety 
issues  appear  manageable.  The  SmPC  and  the  PIL  emphasizes  that  CBD-OS  should  be  taken 
consistently  either  with  or  without  food  to  assure  that  children  are  not  accidently  exposed  to  several 
fold higher doses of CBD. 
Comparing CBD-OS to placebo, the discontinuation rate was higher in the CBD-OS group (8%) than in 
the  placebo  group  (1%).  The  number  of  patients  who  experienced  a  serious  adverse  event  was  also 
higher in the CBD-OS group (20%) than in the placebo group (11%). Adverse events were reported by 
88% in the CBD-OS group as compared to 76% in the placebo group. When comparing the CBD-OS 20 
mg/kg/day  group  to  the  CBD-OS  10  mg/kg/day  group,  the  incidences  of  discontinuations,  serious 
adverse  events,  and  common  adverse  events  were  higher  in  the  CBD-OS  20  mg/kg/day  group.  
Adverse event such as somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, and increased hepatic transaminase 
were common in the CBD-OS groups and occurred more frequently than in the placebo group. Analysis 
of safety in subgroups with different underlying disease, DS or LGS, did not show any clear differences 
across  the different  adverse  events.  Hence,  CBD-OS  may  be  used  in  both  DS  and  LGS  patients  while 
adhering to similar precautions as specified in section 4.3 and 4.4 in the SmPC. 
The  main safety  issue  with  the  use  of  CBD-OS  is  hepatotoxicity.  The  incidence  of  TEAEs  meeting  the 
search criteria for AESI abnormal liver TEAEs was 14.9% in the All CBD-OS group (N=456) compared 
with  3.1%  in  the  placebo  group  (N=292).  The  overall  AESI  incidence  was  higher  in  the  CBD-OS  20 
mg/kg/day group (17.6%; N=307) than the 10 mg/kg/day dose group (9.4%; N=139). 
A  very  clear  dose-response  relationship  with  more  cases  in  the  20  mg/kg/day  group  than  in  the  10 
mg/kg/day group further supports the hepatotoxicity of CBD-OS. The Applicant has provided sufficient 
additional information to document that no patients in the clinical studies or in the EAP died due to a 
hepatotoxic effect of CBD-OS.  
Some information on hepatic synthesis function have been provided, e.g. INR was elevated in approx. 
10%  of  the  population  in  the  OLE  trials,  whereas  the  frequencies  of  abnormal  INR  levels  were 
comparable between the CBD-OS and placebo groups in the phase II/III trials. However, the Applicant 
provided  additional  information  regarding  transaminases  levels  and  the  corresponding  levels  of  INR, 
bilirubin,  and  albumin  in  individual  patients.  This  has  clarified  that  in  some  patients  the  level  of 
bilirubin increased along with transaminase increases even though bilirubin did not increase above the 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 171/190 
 
upper  limit  of  normal.  In  addition,  it  has  been  clarified  that  among  a  few  of  the  patients,  who 
experienced  transaminase  increases,  the  INR  rose  to  levels  slightly  above  the  upper  limit  of  normal. 
Unfortunately, measurements of INR and bilirubin were not always made at a relevant time point. The 
schedule for liver related blood tests comprised four time points after baseline; at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 
weeks, and 14 weeks after start of the treatment. Nevertheless, the Applicant has provided sufficient 
additional information to conclude that the synthesis function was only affected in a few patients with 
ALT  >  5  x  ULN.  Furthermore,  the  Applicant  has  provided  an  overview  of  the  actual  data  on  recovery 
from ALT/AST level > 5 x ULN. Hereby, the Applicant has clarified that the CBD-induced liver injury, as 
assessed  by  transaminase  elevations,  was  transient  if  CBD  was  discontinued/reduced  in  due  time 
Additionally,  the  Applicant  has  provided  more  information  on  the  patients,  who  experienced 
transaminase  elevations  more  than  three  months  after  initiation  of  CBD-OS.  Although  there  were  no 
IgG  measurements  conducted,  it  was  clarified  that  these  patients  did  not  suffer  from  a  CBD  induced 
“autoimmune-like-DILI”. Liver toxicity is primarily hepatocellular and not directed at the biliary system. 
However, in an uncontrolled study in patients in a different non-epilepsy indication, 2 elderly patients 
experienced  elevations  of  alkaline  phosphatase  levels  above  2  times  the  ULN  in  combination  with 
transaminase elevations.  The elevations resolved after discontinuation of Epidyolex. 
The hepatotoxicity of CBD-OS is aggravated in patients with an affected liver function at baseline and 
particularly in patients concomitantly treated with valproate. Patients who did not have an increase in 
ALT  at  baseline  and  were  not  concomitantly  treated  with  valproate  had  only  a  slight  increase  in  ALT 
when treated with CBD-OS 20 mg/kg/day (3% with ALT > 3x ULN) as compared to placebo (1% with 
ALT  >  3x  ULN).  This  is  unlike  patients  who  did  have  an  increase  in  ALT  at  baseline  and  were  not 
treated  with  valproate  (9%  with  ALT  >  3x  ULN).  In  the  placebo  group  it  was  0%.  However  these 
estimations were based on low numbers. At the same time, there is little doubt that the combination of 
valproate and CBD-OS (20% with ALT > 3x ULN) substantially increases the risk of hepatotoxicity as 
compared to CBD-OS without concomitant valproate (9% as noted above). Finally, it is also clear that 
the  combination  of  CBD-OS  and  valproate  in  patients  with  signs  of  an  affected  liver  function  at 
baseline,  significantly  increases  the  risk  of  hepatotoxicity,  even  if  the  numbers  of  patients  in  this 
category is low:  In the CBD-OS 20 mg/kg/day concomitantly treated with valproate and with baseline 
ALT  >  ULN,  64%  of  the  population  developed  ALT  >  3x  ULN.  The  toxicity  of  CBD-OS  in  doses  of  10 
mg/kg/day is significantly lower. Consequently, the SmPC recommends targeted dose maintenance of 
10 mg/kg/day. Concomitant use of clobazam also increased the incidence of transaminase elevations, 
although to a much lesser extent than valproate. 
The liver related adverse events occurred mainly in the weeks 2-7 after the start of the treatment with 
CBD-OS.  However,  some  liver  related  adverse  events  occurred  earlier  and  some  events,  especially in 
patients concomitantly treated with valproate, occurred as late as six month or more after the start of 
the treatment. The Applicant has provided additional information to document that only a minority of 
the patients experienced two peaks of elevated transaminases over the duration of the phase III + OLE 
trials.  Especially  in  patients  concomitantly  treated  with  valproate,  the  onset,  the  duration,  and  the 
possible  reoccurrence  of  liver  injury  varied  considerably.  A  standard  monitoring  of  hepatocellular 
function at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after treatment initiation is proposed for patients treated 
with  10  mg/kg/day  without  baseline  transaminase  elevations  and  not  using  valproate.  Some  patients 
are  subject  to  an  intensified  monitoring  schedule  (2  weeks,  1  month,  2  months,  3  months  and  6 
month)  as  they  are  at  increased  risk  of  hepatocellular  injury  during  treatment  with  Epidyolex.  The 
intensified  monitoring  schedule  applies  to  patients  concomitantly  treated  with  valproate  and  patients 
with  baseline  transaminase  elevations.  Upon  increase  of  their  Epidyolex  dose  greater  than  10 
mg/kg/day,  serum  transaminases  and  total  bilirubin  levels  should  also  be  obtained  according  to  the 
same  intensified  monitoring  schedule  Further,  the  use  of  CBD  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with 
baseline transaminase elevations > 3 X ULN and bilirubin > 2 X ULN.

The  Applicant  has  discussed  the  pathophysiological  reason  for  the  interaction  between  CBD-OS  and 
valproate.  Although  investigations  are  still  ongoing,  it  appears  that  both  valproate  and  CBD  have  an 
inhibitory  effect  on  mitochondrial  respiration.  However,  the  Applicant  is  conducting  a  follow-up  study 
on  the  interaction  between  CBD-OS  and  valproate  and  has  agreed  to  provide  the  results  from  this 
study when available. Finally, the CBD oral solution contains alcohol that will lead to an alcohol intake 
above the upper limit of acceptance for children up to six years of age at the 20 mg/kg/day dose. The 
long-term  effect  of  this  is  unknown  but  upon  request  the  Applicant  has  agreed  to  provide  additional 
data if available.  
In  comparison,  the  age  of  the  patients  or  the  underlying  disease  (healthy  individuals  vs.  DS  vs.  LGS 
vs. other conditions tested in the EAP) did not appear to influence the degree of hepatotoxicity of CBD-
OS treatment. However, it cannot be excluded that other AEDs than  valproate and to a lesser extent 
clobazam,  may  also increase  the  hepatotoxic  effect  of  CBD-OS  but  this  could  not  be  assessed  due to 
the low number of subjects in strata of different combinations of other AEDs. 
Another safety issue is the influence of  CBD-OS on  the CNS. Somnolence, sedation, and lethargy are 
frequently recorded, especially in combination with clobazam. At least one of these events occurred in 
approx. 40% of patients treated with the combination of Epidyolex and clobazam regardless of whether 
Epidyolex  was  administered  as  10  or  20  mg/kg/day.  In  phase  II/III  trials,  3%  discontinued  for  this 
reason.  Aggression  and/or  irritability  occurred  in  9%  of  the  CBD-OS  treated  population,  whereas 
agitation and abnormal behaviour occurred in approx. 5% of the CBD-OS treated population. However, 
only  three  patients  (1%)  discontinued  due  to  aggression  and  none  discontinued  due  to  agitation  and 
abnormal behaviour. Psychosis with hallucinations was not reported. The cases of these adverse events 
occurred  mainly  within  the  two  first  weeks  in  CBD-OS  treated  patients  in  the  phase  II/III  trials.  The 
sudden occurrence in the CBD-OS group after onset of CBD-treatment indicates a casual relation to the 
treatment. The Applicant has provided an additional discussion to clarify that somnolence, sedation and 
lethargy appear transient. In comparison, it is not fully clarified if aggression and abnormal behaviour 
are  transient.  However,  the  Applicant  has  included  the  risk  of  aggression  and  abnormal  behaviour  to 
the  section  4.8  On  the  other  hand,  regarding  the  SAE  status  epilepticus,  high  number  of  patients 
reported this  serious  event  in  both  the  Epidyolex  group  and  placebo  group.  It  should  be  conveyed to 
the  treating  physicians  that  although  there  may  be  a  reduction  in  seizures  frequency,  no  change  in 
frequency  of  status  epilepticus  occurrence  was  observed  in  clinical  trials.  Based  on  these  results,  a 
warning regarding similar risk of Status epilepticus in the Epidyolex and placebo groups is included in 
Section 4.4 in SmPC.   
It is uncertain whether CBD-OS has an effect on cognition and behavioural pattern others than those 
mentioned  above.  Currently  accepted  test  especially  for  cognition  can  only  be  conducted  in  patients 
with  normal  levels  of  cognition  and  normal  pattern  of  behaviour.  As  patients  with  DS  and  LGS  often 
have reduced cognitive abilities, the tests were performed in a relatively small proportion of the entire 
safety  population  and  no  firm  conclusion  could  be  drawn.  However,  the  Applicant  has  discussed  the 
possibility  of  a  decrease  in  cognitive  function,  which  with  the  currently  available  data  cannot  be 
clarified. Therefore, the possible influence on cognitive development has been added to the RMP as a 
potential risk. Considering the very limited data regarding later development of children with LGS and 
in particular with DS and associated unknown long-term impact of CBD-OS on cognitive and endocrine 
functions, potential undesirable effects of CBD-OS on psychological development and endocrine system 
in later childhood may occur.  
There  are  three  reports on  suicidal  ideation/behaviour,  two  in  the  EAP  and  one  in  the  RCT.  However, 
the applicant has provided additional information to clarify a false report of a completed suicide in the 
RCT.  Thus,  CBD-OS  might  increase  the  risk  of  suicidal  ideation/behaviour,  which  is  a  known  class 
effect, but the patients in the EAP have competing risks for developing suicidal ideation/behaviour. This 
is reflected in the SmPC section 4.4.

CBD-OS  contains  a  small  amount  of  THC.  The  applicant  has  provided  an  additional  discussion  the 
concentrations  of  THC  and  CBD  in  CNS  to  address  the  risk  of  abuse.  A  warning  regarding  the  abuse 
potential is currently not warranted. 
The applicant has provided an additional discussion on how the amount of THC probably is too low to 
affect the developing brain. Although chronic cannabis use possibly leads to neuropsychological decline 
in  some  individuals,  the  effect  of  CBD  on  the  developing  brain  in  the  amounts  administered  in  the 
treatment of DS and LGS is not possible to determine. 
Regarding hypersensitivity, it appears that CBD-OS treatment may lead to (a mainly T cell mediated) 
hypersensitivity reaction in approx. 1% of the population. However, in some studies rash was recorded 
in  up  to  23%  of  the  CBD-OS  treated population  as  compared to  none  in other  studies.  The  Applicant 
provided additional information regarding this difference of rash incidences. Since rash and the risk of 
hypersensitivity  reactions  are  already  mentioned  in  the  SmPC  and  the  RMP,  the  issue  is  not  pursued 
any further. In specific patients, the Applicant has clarified that DRESS did not occur.   
In  total,  there  were  seven  deaths.  There  was  one  death  in  the  phase  III  trials,  the  CBD-OS  20 
mg/kg/day group, and there were six deaths in the OLE. The causes of deaths were sudden death in 
epilepsy  (N=2),  bowel  obstruction  with  necrotic  bowel  and  septic  shock  (N=1),  seizure  disorder  with 
cerebral  oedema  and  pulmonary  oedema  (N=1)  and  respiratory  distress  and  aspiration  pneumonia 
(N=3).  The  respiratory  distress  and  aspiration  pneumonia  in  three  patients  followed  an  episode  of 
vomiting,  an  episode of  status  epilepticus,  and  as  a  consequence  of  seizure  disorder due  to perinatal 
hypoxic  ischemic  encephalopathy,  respectively.  The  applicant  has  provided  narratives  and  laboratory 
data to justify that none of the deaths were related to CBD-OS treatment. 
The applicant has provided additional information and discussed additional issues such as an imbalance 
between CBD-OS groups and placebo with regard to diarrhoea, decreased appetite, urinary retention. 
The  risk  of  urinary  retention  as  well  as  of  decreased  appetite  and  a  related  loss  of  weight  cannot  be 
excluded  and  have  been  included  in  the  RMP  as  a  potential  risk  (urinary  retention)  and  described 
further  in  the  SmPC  (weight  loss,  risk  of  reduced  height  gain).    Small  decreases  of  red  blood  cell 
counts, red blood cell volume, and haematocrit were observed over a year of treatment. However, the 
decreases  did  not  continue  and  were  considered  not  clinically  relevant.  Changes  of  creatinine  levels 
and occurrence of pyrexia were noted but were considered not to be of significant clinical relevance.  
Additional long-term safety data have been provided. In the original submission, the long term data of 
study  GWEP1415  were  not  included.  Comparing  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  in  the  placebo-
controlled trials with the long term data, the incidence of adverse events per time on study remained 
unchanged throughout the studies. 
Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database is considered adequate since DS and LGS are orphan diseases. It includes 456 DS 
and  LGS  patients  (DS;N=221  and  LGS;N=235)  patients  from  four  pivotal  Phase  III  studies. 
Additionally, 27 DS patients from a phase II study and 630 patients in the open-label extension, OLE, 
study. Of the 630 patients in the OLE, 353 had not previously been exposed to CBD-OS.  In the phase 
3 clinical trials, the patient years of exposure to CBD-OS 10 mg/kg/day were 36.26 py while exposure 
to 20 mg/kg/day was 76.45 py. The most common adverse events comprise nervous system disorders 
in 42% (10 mg/kg/day), including somnolence, sedation, lethargy, and convulsion, changed laboratory 
parameters  related  to  liver  function  in  21%  (10  mg/kg/day),  and  psychiatric  disorders  in  17%  (10 
mg/kg/day),  including  aggression  and  abnormal  behaviour.  The  size  of  the  safety  database  makes  it 
likely  that  rare  adverse  events  or  adverse  events  occurring  after  longer  exposure  have  not  been 
captured.

There is a pronounced effect of food on the bioavailability (and consequently plasma concentration) of 
CBD,  which  is  addressed  by  instructing  caregiver  that  CBD-OS  is  taken  consistently  either  with  or 
without  meals.  The  main  safety  issue  with  CBD-OS  is  hepatotoxicity,  which  in  some  instances  was 
severe and serious, resulting in hospitalisation. The risk of hepatotoxicity is increased in patients taking 
Valproate and to a lesser extent in patients taking clobazam, especially if the baseline liver function is 
affected.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
There are restrictions to the use of CBD-OS for patients at increased risk of adverse reactions; patients 
concomitantly treated with valproate acid, patients with concomitant transaminase elevations, and 
patients with signs of DILI. These patients are subject to an intensified monitoring schedule. Further, 
the risk of somnolence and sedation in approx. 40% of the treated population is emphasised.  
A follow-up study on the interaction between CBD-OS and valproate is on-going and the final study 
report should be provided once available.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the RMP version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 25.06.2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
With the responses to the 2nd D180 List of Outstanding Issues the applicant has withdrawn the claim 
that cannabidiol is a NAS. A NAS status was no longer applied for during the evaluation. 
At the time of the withdrawal of the NAS claim, it was the CHMP’s view that based on the review of the 
data, the active substance cannabidiol contained in the medicinal product Epidyolex is not to be

qualified as a new active substance in itself or in comparison to cannabidiol (herbal extract of Cannabis 
sativa L.), which is contained in the medicinal product, Sativex oromucosal spray, previously 
authorized in the European Union. The CHMP concluded that cannabidiol in both products are 
structurally identical, hence the patients are exposed to the same therapeutic moiety, i.e. cannabidiol

the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy. The onset of LGS usually 
occurs between 3 and 5 years of age and is characterised by the presence of multiple seizure types 
(predominantly tonic, atonic, and atypical absence seizures), slow electroencephalogram spike-waves 
with abnormal background activity when awake, and fast polyspikes during sleep. Other seizure types 
can occur in LGS, including generalised tonic–clonic, focal, and myoclonic seizures. These seizure types 
have onset in childhood, and many persist into adulthood. Status epilepticus (SE) may occur in some 
patients with LGS. LGS can be subdivided into cases of known origin (genetic, structural, metabolic, 
immune and infectious) and idiopathic cases, in which the first clinical sign is often the occurrence of 
abrupt falls (commonly referred to as drop attacks/seizures). Drop seizures are common in LGS and 
can lead to physical injury. Cognitive impairment is apparent in ≥ 75% of all LGS patients by 5 years 
post onset, and behavioural and psychiatric comorbidities (including attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder and aggressive behaviour) are common. Children and adolescents with LGS have an increased 
risk of death. Neurological comorbidity including prolonged seizures and SE are correlated with 
mortality and, in particular, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). While there are 4 approved 
treatments for LGS in the European Union (EU), most patients with LGS continue to experience drug-
resistant epilepsy (DRE). 
Dravet Syndrome (DS), also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, is a rare form of severe 
DRE with onset in early childhood. DS is characterised by a variety of treatment-resistant seizures 
(febrile and afebrile, generalized and unilateral, clonic or tonic–clonic) that occur in the first year of 
life. Onset usually occurs between 4 and 8 months of age in an apparently normal infant and is often 
triggered by fever. In addition to convulsive seizures, other seizure types appear between the ages of 
1 and 4 years, including myoclonic seizures, focal seizures, and atypical absences. Status epilepticus 
may occur at initial presentation or later in the clinical course. By late childhood, the seizure profile will 
often have stabilised. Significant developmental delay becomes apparent from the second year 
onwards and associated neuropsychological disturbances, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, are common. Intellectual impairment affects nearly all patients and is severe in 50% of 
cases. Dependency in adulthood is common. Approximately 75% of patients with DS have mutations in 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019 
Page 180/190 
 
the voltage-gated sodium channel α1 subunit gene (SCN1A); mutations in other genes have been 
reported in the remaining 25% of SCN1A-negative DS patients, e.g., PCDH19 (protocadherin-19). 
Long-term seizure outcomes in DS are poor, with many patients still having seizures in adulthood. 
Death during childhood is common in DS. SUDEP and SE are the most common causes of death in DS, 
with drowning and accidental death following seizures also common causes. Risk factors for SUDEP 
include frequent generalized tonic–clonic seizures, early seizure onset, polytherapy, and developmental 
delay, all of which are common in DS. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Felbamate, lamotrigine (LTG), topiramate and rufinamide are approved in the EU as adjunctive therapy 
for treatment of LGS. Only stiripentol (STP), when taken in conjunction with sodium valproate (VPA) 
and clobazam (CLB), is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of DS; neither VPA nor CLB are 
approved for LGS or DS specifically, but both are approved for use in epilepsy in the EU, and widely 
used in both indications. In both indications, VPA is often used to prevent the initial recurrence of 
convulsive seizures, and benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam, or CLB) are 
frequently coadministered to limit the duration of long-lasting seizures. Second-line and later options in 
DS typically include STP, topiramate, ketogenic diet, levetiracetam (LEV), bromides, and vagus nerve 
stimulation (VNS), while LTG, rufinamide, lacosamide, and felbamate are also used in LGS. Polytherapy 
is common in both indications. Of note, patients with DS may be prone to seizure exacerbation with 
sodium channel modulators such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, LTG, phenytoin, and vigabatrin. 
In both indications, sufficient seizure control may be difficult to achieve, and thus there is a need for 
new therapies with a different mode of action. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development program supporting the efficacy of CBD-OS comprises 2 randomised, placebo-
controlled trials in LGS; 1 investigating 10 and 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1414) and 1 investigating 
20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1423), and 2 randomised, placebo-controlled trials in DS; 1 investigating 
10 and 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1424) and 1 investigating 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1332 
Part B).  
The pivotal trials consisted of a 4-week baseline period, followed by a 14-week treatment period 
comprising a 2-week titration (dose escalation) period and a 12-week maintenance (stable dosing) 
period. Patients who discontinued the investigational medicinal product (IMP) were to taper the dose 
over a 10-day period, with a safety follow-up 4 weeks after final dose.  
All pivotal trials included male and female patients who were taking 1 or more AEDs which had been 
maintained at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. All medications or 
nonpharmacological interventions for epilepsy (including ketogenic diet and VNS) were to remain 
stable throughout the trial. For enrolment in the LGS trials, patients had to be aged 2–55 years 
(inclusive), with a clinical diagnosis of LGS. This included written documentation of having met 
electroencephalographic diagnostic criteria (slow < 3.0 Hz] spike-and-wave pattern) during the 
patient’s history and evidence of more than 1 type of generalized seizure, including drop seizures, for 
at least 6 months. Patients had to have documented failures on more than 1 AED and had to have 
experienced at least 2 drop seizures each week of the 4-week baseline period. A drop seizure was 
defined as an attack or spell (atonic, tonic, or tonic–clonic) involving the entire body, trunk or head 
that led or could have led to a fall, injury, slumping in a chair or hitting the patient’s head on a surface. 
For enrolment in the DS trials, patients had to be aged 2–18 years (inclusive), with a clinical diagnosis 
of DS confirmed by a committee of independent experts and had to have experienced 4 or more 
Assessment report

Page 181/190 
 
convulsive seizures during the 4-week baseline period. A convulsive seizure was defined as a tonic, 
clonic, tonic–clonic, or atonic seizure.  
All pivotal trials were double-blind. Randomisation was stratified by 4 age groups for the LGS trials (2 
to < 6, 6 to < 12, 12 to < 18, and 18 to < 56 years) and 3 age groups for the DS trials (2 to < 6, 6 to 
< 13, and 13 to < 19 years). Primary and key secondary endpoints centred primarily on changes in 
seizure frequency, and were based on daily seizure reports. The number and type of seizures 
experienced by a patient were reported daily using a telephone-based IVRS. The primary endpoints 
were percentage change from baseline in drop seizure frequency for the LGS trials, and convulsive 
seizure frequency for the DS trials during the treatment period, for CBD-OS compared with placebo. All 
pivotal trials included as a key secondary endpoint the proportion of CBD-OS vs. placebo patients who 
achieved at least a 50% reduction from baseline in either drop seizure frequency (LGS) or convulsive 
seizure frequency (DS). Other key secondary endpoints in the trials included the percentage change 
from baseline in total seizure frequency during the treatment period, and the Subject/Caregiver Global 
Impression of Change (S/CGIC) at last visit, for CBD-OS compared with placebo. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was met in all four studies with an approximately 40-50% median seizure 
reduction (drop seizures in LGS, convulsive seizures in DS) in the active groups as compared to 
approximately 15-25% in the placebo groups: 
Study GWEP1414 (Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome): A greater median reduction in drop seizure frequency 
during the treatment period was seen in the both the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (-41.86) and the 10 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS (-37.16) groups, compared with the placebo group (-17.17). The estimated 
median difference was in favour of CBD-OS treatment over placebo for both 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (-
21.57; 95% CI: -34.79, -6.67) and 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (-19.19; 95% CI: -31.24, -7.69); the 
difference between each CBD-OS group and placebo was statistically significant (p=0.0047 and 
p=0.0016, respectively). 
Study GWEP1423 (Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome): A greater median reduction in drop seizure frequency 
during the treatment period was seen in the CBD-OS group (-43.90), compared with the placebo group 
(-21.80). The estimated median difference was in favour of CBD-OS treatment over placebo (-17.21; 
95% CI: -30.32, -4.09), and the difference between treatment groups was statistically significant 
(p=0.0135). 
Study GWEP1332B (Dravet Syndrome): The median percentage change from baseline in total 
convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period was −38.94 in the CBD-OS group compared 
with −13.29 in the placebo group. The estimated median difference was in favour of CBD-OS 
treatment over placebo (−22.79; 95% CI: −41.06, −5.43) and the difference between treatments was 
statistically significant (p=0.0123). 
Study GWEP1424 (Dravet Syndrome): The median percentage change from baseline in total convulsive 
seizure frequency during the treatment period was -48.7 in the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, -45.7 in 
the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, and -26.9 in the placebo group. The estimated median difference 
was in favour of CBD-OS treatment over placebo for both10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS and 20 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS; the difference between each CBD-OS group and placebo was statistically significant 
(p=0.0095 and p=0.0299, respectively). 
Similar degrees of reduction were seen in total seizures as well as across seizure types. 
Assessment report 
EMA/458106/2019

In the LGS studies the primary analysis was supported by key secondary analyses including responder 
analyses and global impression of change. In terms of drop seizure free days, the treatment difference 
in LGS corresponded to 3-5 drop seizure free days per 28 days. 
In Dravet Syndrome, the key secondary endpoint (responder analysis) was not met in Study 
GWEP1332B. In Study GWEP1424, the key secondary analyses supported the primary analyses. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Prandial state was not specified in the pivotal studies although exposure is highly dependent on 
whether CBD-OS is taken with food or not. Exposure could therefore not be accurately related to 
efficacy and safety. Considering that dose is always titrated according to both efficacy and safety, this 
uncertainty can be considered manageable provided the CBD-OS is consistently taken either with or 
without food. The SmPC clearly reflects this.  
CBD-OS was presented as an oral solution containing 100 mg/ml CBD in sesame oil with anhydrous 
ethanol (79 mg/ml), added sweetener (sucralose), and strawberry flavouring ). Placebo was presented 
as an oral solution of sesame oil containing anhydrous ethanol (79 mg/ml), added sweetener 
(sucralose), and strawberry flavouring . It is likely that the taste of CBD-OS was different - and less 
pleasant - than that of placebo as reflected by the caregiver palatability scores. However, there is no 
evidence that this fact was commonly known during the course of the pivotal studies. 
The two syndromes LGS and DS are both considered epileptic encephalopathies, are high frequency 
seizure disorders comprised of multiple seizure types, share many of the same seizure types, are 
highly treatment refractory and they are to some degree treated with same medications.  Morbidity 
and mortality are high in both disorders, and SUDEP is a common cause of death at a young age.  
However, the syndromes differ in age of onset and etiology: Dravet Syndrome is usually associated 
with SCN1A mutations, and may likely be considered a sodium channel disorder, whereas SCN1A 
mutations are usually not seen in LGS. Thus, there is not a clear biological rationale for expecting 
rather similar effect sizes in the two indications. While the finding of rather similar effect sizes may be 
a consequence of CBD-OS having unspecific anticonvulsive properties, the methodological and 
pharmacokinetic issues discussed in this report may also play a role. 
Some of the difference in apparent effect size, between patients treated with and without clobazam, 
may be ascribed to the bi-directional pharmacokinetic interaction with clobazam (leading to increased 
clobazam active metabolite N-CLB concentrations and increased CBD active metabolite 7-OH-CBD 
concentrations). CBD-OS and clobazam have a complex 2-way metabolic interaction. CBD-OS inhibits 
CYP2C19 which is required to metabolise the active clobazam metabolite N-CLB. This leads to a 2 to 4 
fold increase in N-CLB and an approximate 1.5-fold increase in 7-OH-CBD concentrations which may 
partially explain the treatment difference.  In the pivotal trials a substantial proportion of patients 
received clobazam concomitant treatment at baseline (approximately 50% in LGS and 65% in DS). The 
Applicant performed various analyses intended to demonstrate independent efficacy of CBD-OS. 
However, in all pivotal trials, performing the primary analysis on the subgroup of patients on CLB and 
the subgroup of patients not on CLB consistently revealed larger treatment effect sizes in the CLB 
subgroups than in the non-CLB subgroups. The CHMP considers that the clinical relevance of the 
observed effect of CBD-OS in patients not on clobazam has not been established.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
CBD-OS can cause hepatocellular injury.  Two patients concomitantly treated with valproate 
experienced toxic hepatocellular injury in combination with metabolic acidosis and encephalopathy, 
respectively. The incidence of TEAEs meeting the search criteria for AESI abnormal liver TEAEs was 
14.9% in the All CBD-OS group (N=456) compared with 3.1% in the placebo group (N=292). 
However, the number of liver-related adverse events was strongly dose-dependent. In the phase II/III 
20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups 16% of the population developed transaminases elevations > 3 x ULN 
whereas in the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups 3% developed transaminases elevations > 3 x ULN as 
compared to 1% in the placebo group. Overall, approx. 4% of the CBD-OS population in the phase 
II/III study discontinued due to liver related AE/SAEs, mainly transaminases elevation. 
The hepatotoxicity of CBD-OS is aggravated in patients with an affected liver function, i.e. ALT > ULN 
at baseline, and in patients concomitantly treated with valproate. Patients who did not have an 
increase in ALT at baseline and were not concomitantly treated with valproate had only a slight 
increase in ALT when treated with CBD-OS 20 mg/kg/day (3% with ALT > 3x ULN) as compared to 
placebo (1% with ALT > 3x ULN). This is unlike patients who did have an increase in ALT at baseline 
and were not treated with valproate (12% of patients with ALT > ULN at baseline, and 9% of patients 
with ALT > 3x ULN at baseline). 
At the same time, the combination of valproate and CBD-OS (20% with ALT > 3x ULN) substantially 
increases the risk of hepatotoxicity as compared to CBD-OS without concomitant valproate (5% with 
ALT > 3x ULN) regardless of baseline ALT. In correspondent placebo groups it was 0%.  
Finally, the combination of CBD-OS and valproate in patients with an affected liver function at baseline, 
increases the risk of hepatotoxicity as compared to the risk of hepatotoxicity if the patients had only 
had one risk factor (i.e. only baseline ALT > ULN or concomitant treatment with valproate). In the 
CBD-OS 20 mg/kg/day treated with valproate and with baseline ALT > ULN, 64% of the population 
developed ALT > 3x ULN. In the study, GWEP1424, all patients who experienced transaminase levels 
following CBD-OS treatment were concomitantly treated with valproate.  
The CBD-OS treatment increased the risk of somnolence and sedation, especially when used in 
combination with clobazam. Approximately 40% of the patients concomitantly treated with Epidyolex 
and clobazam experienced clinically significant somnolence and/or sedation regardless of whether 
Epidyolex was administered as 10 or 20 mg/kg/day. Further, lethargy (9 % in CBD 10mg/kg/day 
groups vs. 2% in the placebo group) and aggression (2% in CBD 10 mg/kg/day groups vs. 1% in the 
placebo group) were observed. 
The risk of status epilepticus was not reduced by CBD treatment; the frequency of status epilepticus 
was similar in the CBD and placebo groups during the clinical trials.   
A dose-dependent decrease of appetite (22% in CBD 20 mg/kg/day groups), which in some patients 
translated into a weight loss (11% in CBD 20mg/kg/day groups) was observed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials, the patient years of exposure to CBD-OS 10 
mg/kg/day were 36.26 py while exposure to 20 mg/kg/day was 76.45 py. The size of the safety 
database makes it likely that rare adverse events or adverse events occurring after longer exposure 
have not been yet captured.

Notes: *-48.7 in the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, -45.7 in the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, and -
26.9 in the placebo group. The estimated median difference was in favour of CBD-OS treatment over 
placebo for both 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS and 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS; the difference between each CBD-
OS group and placebo was statistically significant (p=0.0095 and p=0.0299, respectively). 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Both LGS and DS are serious debilitating conditions affecting children early in life. Both conditions are 
associated with seizures as well as a high risk of impaired cognition and/or severe neuropsychological 
disturbances. Currently available antiepileptic treatment rarely succeeds in keeping the children free of 
seizures and the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remains high. Thus, there is a 
clear unmet medical need. In that respect, the statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency 
offered by CBD-OS constitutes a favourable effect in this difficult to treat population. In the LGS and 
one of the DS studies, the clinical relevance of the observed relative reduction in primary seizure 
frequency is supported by a responder analysis demonstration that CBD-OS (at doses of both 20 
mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day), compared to placebo, significantly increases the number of patients 
achieving a 50 % reduction in primary seizure frequency. A reduction of 50% in the frequency of 
seizures is considered a clinically relevant effect. However, some notable uncertainties about the 
favourable effect of CBD-OS remain. In particular, the favourable effect of CBD-OS appears to be 
linked to co-administration of clobazam whereas the effect of CBD-OS without concomitant clobazam

was smaller and it was considered that clinical relevance has not been established.  A Scientific 
Advisory Group (SAG) convened to discuss the issue of the clinical relevance of effect of CBD-OS in 
patients not receiving clobazam “were not fully convinced that they (the efficacy data) are reliably 
demonstrating an effect in patients OFF -clobazam treatment, mainly, from a statistical point of view.” 
Notwithstanding this, the SAG was split in terms of whether a clinical relevant effect off clobazam had 
been demonstrated. Thus, the CHMP considers that efficacy of CBD-OS in combination with other AEDs 
and not clobazam is smaller and clinical relevance has not been established. At the SAG, the clinical 
utility of limiting the indication to patients receiving concomitant clobazam was discussed. The SAG 
was split in that respect, some experts confirmed that they supported an indication restricting the use 
of CBD-OS to patients already receiving clobazam whereas others were against such a restriction.     
Treatment with CBD-OS is clearly associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, primarily in 
terms of elevations of transaminases. In particular, patients with concomitant treatment with valproate 
and pre-existing elevated transaminases are prone to experience additional elevation of 
transaminases. Provided that adequate measures are taken to monitor liver function/damage and 
provided that adequate measures are mandated in case of significant toxicity, as recommended in the 
SmPC, this risk is considered manageable and acceptable taking into consideration the seriousness of 
the conditions intended to be treated, including the grave prognosis for these children. The SAG 
confirmed that these patients are cared for in a setting and by physicians that are capable of and 
experienced in handling these safety issues.  
There is a pronounced effect of food on the bioavailability of the CBS-OS. Unfortunately, in the 
presented clinical studies, CBD-OS was not systematically administered either with or without food. 
This results in uncertainty about the relationship between exposure and clinical safety and efficacy. 
However, as the dose of CBD-OS is gradually titrated according to efficacy and safety, this uncertainty 
is considered manageable, provided that CBD-OS in the individual patients is systematically 
administered either with or without food. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Whereas a clinically relevant effect of CBD-OS in patients receiving clobazam appears well-
documented, a clinically relevant effect of CBD-OS in patients not receiving clobazam remains 
unproven. Available data from subgroup analyses clearly indicates that the effect off clobazam is 
smaller and clinical relevance has not been established.  
In contrast, clinically relevant efficacy for CBD-OS in combination with clobazam was clearly 
demonstrated. Furthermore, the safety in these patients is considered acceptable provided that the 
precautions outlined in the SmPC are adhered to. As at least part of the SAG group considered a 
restricted indication clinically relevant, the CHMP concluded that the benefit risk is positive for a 
restricted indication for the use of CBD-OS in conjunction with clobazam. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Epidyolex is positive for the indication “adjunctive therapy of seizures associated 
with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in conjunction with clobazam, for 
patients 2 years of age and older”.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Epidyolex is favourable in the following indication: 
Epidyolex is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut 
syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with clobazam, for patients 2 years of age 
and older. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

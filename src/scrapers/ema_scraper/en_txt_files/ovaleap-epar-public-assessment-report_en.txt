2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a gonadotropic hormone produced by the anterior lobe of 
the mammalian pituitary gland. It is indispensable for normal female and male gamete growth 
and maturation, and normal gonadal steroid production. Deficient endogenous production of FSH 
is a known cause of infertility and administration of exogenous gonadotropins is used to treat this 
condition. Naturally derived FSH, manufactured from the urine of post-menopausal women, has 
been available for over 30 years. The availability of recombinant DNA technology allows the 
manufacture of FSH independently of the collection of large volumes of urine and provides a 
highly pure product devoid of infectious or pharmacological contaminants such as luteinising 
hormone (LH), proteinacious or potentially allergenic materials. 
About the product  
Ovaleap is presented as a sterile, clear solution for subcutaneous injection. The concentration of 
the formulation is 600 IU follitropin alfa (equivalent to 44 µg). The solution contains mannitol, L-
methionine and polysorbate 20 as stabilisers, benzyl alcohol and benzalkonium chloride as 
preservatives and sodium phosphate buffer for adjustment of pH 7.0. 
The Applicant claims Ovaleap to be a biosimilar medicinal product to Gonal-f, 75 IU (5.5 
micrograms), powder and solvent for solution for injection, for which Merck Serono Europe Ltd., 
United Kingdom is Marketing Authorisation Holder since 20 October 1995. The active substance 
of Ovaleap is recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (rhFSH). Throughout the dossier 
and in this AR the code name XM17 has been used for the r-hFSH used for the production of 
Ovaleap. 
There are currently two recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (rhFSH) preparations 
marketed in Europe; Gonal-f, which contains follitropin alfa as active substance (EMA, 1995), and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 10/72 
 
  
  
Puregon, which contains follitropin beta as active substance (EMA, 1996). The amino acid 
sequence of follitropins alfa and beta are indistinguishable both from each other and from human 
FSH (hFSH) derived from urine; follitropin alfa and beta differ in their glycosylation patterns. 
XM17 is an rhFSH which has been developed as a biosimilar medicinal product with Gonal-f as 
reference product. It is expressed in genetically modified Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and 
produced through a large-scale cell culture process. The rhFSH is a heterodimeric glycoprotein 
hormone weighing approximately 22,690 Da, the sum of the non-covalently bound alfa (10,205 
Da) and beta (12,485 Da) subunits. The alfa subunit (92 amino acids) is common to the other 
gonadotropins, LH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), whilst the beta subunit (111 amino 
acids) confers specificity. The Applicant claims XM17 and Gonal-f have a high degree of similarity 
in terms of glycosylation profile.  
Currently approved recFSH 
The currently approved recombinant follicle stimulating hormones (FSH) in Europe are:  
• 
• 
Gonal-f (EU/1/95/001/001-035, MAH: Serono Europe Ltd.), the reference product in this 
biosimilar application. 
Three pre-filled multidose preparations are available: 300 IU/0.5 ml (EU/1/95/001/033), 
450 IU/0.75 ml (EU/1/95/001/034) and 900 IU/1.5 ml (EU/1/95/001/035). 
Puregon (EU/1/96/008/001-041, MAH: N.V. Organon). Puregon has the same indications 
as Gonal-f, except for the following indication “stimulation of follicular development in 
women with severe LH and FSH deficiency in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) 
preparation”, which is only approved for Gonal-f. 
Background on mechanism of action FSH within the Assisted Reproduction Techniques 
(ART) 
Secretion of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) is controlled by GnRH (gonadotropin releasing 
hormone) produced in the hypothalamus. 
FSH, like LH, is synthesized and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. It is a heterodimeric 
glycoprotein consisting of two non-covalently bound subunits; alfa and beta. All glycopeptides 
(FSH, LH, TSH, and hCG) share a common α-chain, an identical structure containing 92 amino 
acids. It has two N-glycosylation sites. The β-subunit, which is specific for r-hFSH, consists of 
111 amino acids, and has also two N-glycosylation sites. Due to extensive post-translational 
glycosylation the hormone exists in a variety of isoforms. 
FSH is essential for normal female gamete growth and maturation, and induction of normal 
gonadal steroid production. In the first protocols used in ART (standard “long” protocol), a GnRH 
agonist was used to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary ovarian axis (pituitary down regulation) 
for controlled ovarian stimulation and additionally to prevent a premature LH surge. When 
desensibilisation has been achieved, controlled (= exogenous) ovarian stimulation with 
gonadotropins (FSH alone or FSH + LH) is started, while the use of the GnRH agonist is 
continued until the time when hCG will be administered. HCG is administered for final follicular 
maturation and triggering of ovulation after confirmation of adequate follicular development. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 11/72 
 
  
  
Another option to achieve desensibilisation is the use of a GnRH antagonist. In contrast to the 
long-acting GnRH-agonists which after an initial stimulation (flare-up effect), inhibit pituitary 
gonadotropin secretion by desensitizing gonadotrophins to GnRH via receptor down-regulation, 
the antagonists block GnRH receptor in a dose-dependent competitive fashion and have no flare 
effect1; gonadotropin suppression is almost immediate. 
FSH is available as recombinant peptide produced by cultured cells (Gonal-f, Puregon). FSH 
derived from human menopausal urine is also available on the European market in combination 
with LH (hMG = human menopausal gonadotropin (e.g. Menopur)), or in purified forms derived 
from human menopausal urine. These different formulations are equally effective in achieving 
pregnancy2,3. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance in Ovaleap, referred to as XM17, is a recombinant human follicle 
stimulating hormone (rhFSH) claimed to be biosimilar to the reference product Gonal-f (follitropin 
alfa) authorised in the EU (EMEA/H/C/71). 
FSH is a glycoprotein hormone that is produced in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. FSH is 
indispensable for normal female and male gamete growth and maturation and normal gonadal 
steroid production. Deficient endogenous production of FSH is a known cause of infertility and 
administration of exogenous gonadotropins is used to treat this condition.  
FSH is a glycoprotein consisting of two non-covalently bound subunits: 
- The alfa chain is common to other heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones (FSH, luteinising 
hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone and chorionic gonadotropin). It has 92 amino acids 
with 10 cysteine residues resulting in five disulfide bridges. It has two N-glycosylation sites (Asn 
52 and Asn 78) and contains three methionine residues.  
- The beta chain, which is specific for FSH, consists of 111 amino acids with 12 cysteine residues 
resulting in six disulfide bridges. It also has two N-glycosylation sites (Asn 7 and Asn 24) and 
contains one methionine residue.

XM17 is being expressed in a CHO derived cell line after adaptation to serum free conditions. A 
two-tiered cell banking system of Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) was 
developed and maintained in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and 
ICH guidelines. An extensive range of tests was performed for their characterisation, in 
accordance with ICH guidelines, including identity, viability, stability, presence of adventitious 
agents. 
Manufacturing process 
The manufacturing process XM17 active substance incorporates the maintenance of recombinant 
CHO cells in serum free cell culture media. The CHO cells secrete the active substance into the 
medium.  
The process includes the following main steps: 
- 
Thawing of cells and expansion in flasks; 
-  Main culture in bioreactor; 
-  Harvest with filtration; 
- 
Purification with a series of chromatography, viral inactivation and filtration and 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps. 
Process validation 
The process validation program was conducted at commercial scale and was supplemented by a 
set of small scale validation studies. Acceptance criteria applied during process validation were 
based on data obtained during XM17 development. The refined and proposed acceptance criteria 
for the control of the validated and final manufacturing process were presented. 
Manufacturing process development 
Several changes were introduced during development, including changes to the fermentation and 
purification process and site transfers. A comparability exercise was performed to support these 
changes. 
Characterisation 
1. Elucidation of structure and other characteristics: 
1.1. Physicochemical characterisation: 
XM17 active substance was extensively characterised using orthogonal state-of-the-art methods. 
The parameters determined included molecular mass, N-terminal sequencing, peptide mapping, 
secondary structure, isoform distribution and extensive glycosylation analysis. Some of the 
methods are also in use as routine batch release tests. 
The majority of glycans exhibited by XM17 are sialylated, with relatively high amounts of di-, tri- 
and tetra-sialylated glycans, a smaller amount of monosialylated glycans and lower amounts of 
the other studied forms of sialylated glycans. Glycans with Neu5Gc were detected in XM17.  
1.2. Biological characterisation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 13/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Potency was established with the Ph. Eur. in vivo rat bioassay (routine control method) and with 
an in vitro cell-based receptor binding assay (only for characterisation). 
2. Variants and impurities: 
Product-related impurities include non-monomeric rhFSH (aggregates and multimers), truncated 
forms, oxidised forms, and deamidated species. 
The main potential process-related impurities include residual host cell proteins (HCP), residual 
DNA, insulin and isopropanol. 
Specification 
The proposed release and stability specifications for XM17comprise test attributes for appearance 
(visual inspection), pH (Ph. Eur.), identity, glycosylation and isoform analysis, content, potency, 
purity, specified impurities and bioburden, (Ph. Eur.), endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The current specifications, including the acceptance limits, are considered as justified and 
acceptable. 
Stability 
The design of the stability program, including the testing intervals and temperature storage 
conditions, are in accordance with current guidelines. The tests chosen are a subset of tests from 
the release specifications selected for stability-indicating properties.  
The stability data provided were within the specifications and support a shelf life for the active 
substance of 24 months when stored at less than -70°C. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant 
negative trend, should be reported to EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The active substance is formulated with sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sodium 
hydroxide, mannitol, L-methionine, polysorbate 20, benzyl alcohol, benzalkonium chloride and 
water for injections. These excipients are commonly used for biopharmaceutical preparations. 
The Ovaleap formulation is based on the reference product Gonal-f and another FSH-containing 
product Puregon (EMEA/H/C/86). 
Ovaleap is presented as a solution for injection in a cartridge with the following dosage forms 
(600 IU follitropin alfa per mL): 300 IU/0.5 mL, 450 IU/0.75 mL and 900 IU/1.5 mL. One pack of 
Ovaleap contains 1 cartridge and 10 or 20 injection needles. It should be administered by 
subcutaneous injection with a re-usable CE-marked pen provided separately. 
The container closure system consists of an uncoloured 1.5 mL Type 1 glass cartridge, a 
bromobutyl stopper, an aluminium crimp caps with rubber liner (bromobutyl rubber on product 
side).

Adventitious agents 
Non-viral adventitious agents: 
Tests of raw materials of non-animal origin including excipients 
Except the cell banks, all raw materials and excipients used in the production process are of non-
animal source. The serum-free cell culture medium contains no animal-derived components and 
is manufactured using non-animal derived materials only. The medium includes recombinant 
human insulin produced in an animal component-free process.  
Raw materials, solutions and buffers and excipients are tested for endotoxins.  
In addition, testing for bioburden (bacteria, fungi) is performed on the purified water, water for 
injections, phosphate buffered saline solution, buffers and solutions used for the chromatography 
step up to and including the final virus filtration, and all excipients. 
The cell culture medium is tested for sterility according to Ph. Eur. 
Tests of raw materials of animal origin 
The MCB and WCB are the only animal-derived materials employed in the manufacturing process.  
Raw materials of biological origin were employed during the development of the cell lines or the 
generation of cell banks only. There are no concerns regarding TSE in relation to the use of these 
raw materials. 
Tallow derivatives 
The supplier for the raw materials of the stopper formulation uses tallow derivatives during 
manufacture. They are manufactured from tallow by rigorous processes as stated in the Note for 
Guidance EMA/410/01, as revised and do not present a quantifiable BSE risk. 
Testing of microbial contamination 
MCB and WCB are tested for microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, yeasts) according to Ph. Eur. and 
by examination using transmission electron microscopy. Mycoplasma tests were performed 
according to Ph. Eur. Both cell banks were found to be free from any contaminants. 
In-process controls during production 
Appropriate testing is conducted to ensure that the cell cultures do not show signs of microbial 
contamination. All concentrates are tested for bioburden.  
In relation to the finished product manufacturing process, integrity of the filters is confirmed. 
Environmental monitoring is conducted throughout the process. 
Viral adventitious agents: 
Three complementary approaches are used to control the potential viral contamination of the 
product: 
Testing of cell banks and other raw materials of biological origin 
Extensive tests for viral contamination were performed on the MCB in accordance with ICH Q5A. 
No viral contamination was detected.

No evidence for viral contamination was found in the two post-production cell banks. 
Viral testing of unprocessed bulk 
The unprocessed harvest is tested for viral adventitious agents using a 14-day in vitro assay. No 
viral contamination was detected. 
Viral clearance studies 
Two of the downstream manufacturing steps were specifically designed for virus reduction and a 
third step was also validated for viral reduction capacity. Viral reduction studies in validated 
down-scaled models were performed, using adequate model viruses.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process includes the following steps: 
- Preparation of the stock solutions and buffers; 
- Mixing of appropriate volumes; 
- Filtration and aseptic filling into glass cartridges; 
- Visual inspection; 
- Labelling, blistering and packaging. 
Product specification 
The batch release specifications for the medicinal product are based on results from batch 
consistency testing and are considered acceptable. Appropriate tests (including tests for identity, 
purity, content, pharmaceutical tests and microbiological tests) and limits are in place. 
Stability of the product 
Real-time and accelerated stability studies were initiated in accordance to ICH guidelines and per 
protocol to monitor the time-temperature stability of cGMP lots of finished product. On the basis 
of the data provided, the approvable shelf life for the finished product is two years at 2-8°C, with 
the additional option of storage at room temperature (not above 25°C) for up to three months. 
The in-use shelf life is 28 days at 25°C. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines,  any  confirmed  out-of-specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to EMA. 
Comparability Exercise for Finished Medicinal Product  
A  comprehensive  and  state-of-the-art  comparability  exercise  with  the  reference  medicinal 
product Gonal-f was performed to demonstrate biosimilarity. The programme covered: 
- Molecular mass; 
- Primary structure; 
- Secondary structure; 
- Isoform distribution; 
- Glycosylation profile (including composition of N-linked glycans, sialic acid content, site-specific 
glycosylation analysis);

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
Manufacture 
The process is well described. The CHO host cell line, the construction and characterisation of the 
expression plasmid and the transfection, clonal selection and isolation of the production cell line, 
followed by the final generation and storage of MCB and WCB are well described. 
Characterisation and stability data of both MCB and WCB are sufficient after supplementary data 
were provided in response to the Day 120 and Day 180 questions. 
The monitoring of manufacturing steps was sufficiently described. The operating and critical 
ranges of the in-process parameters and tests were derived from data collected during the 
development of the upstream and downstream process, data collected in down-scaled validation 
studies (in particular with regard to purification capacity of a number of impurities in relation to 
load, column life-time studies and viral reduction validation) and data from the manufacture at 
commercial scale of three validation batches and several transfer and conformance batches. 
Critical in-process controls (IPCs) are clearly defined and deemed acceptable.  
Process validation/evaluation is considered satisfactory. 
Characterisation 
XM17 active substance was extensively characterised using orthogonal state-of-the-art methods. 
Since most characterisation studies included comparison to the reference product, dependent on 
the techniques, studies were done with active substance as manufactured with the commercial 
scale upstream and downstream process, active substance isolated from finished product, 
finished product or active substance formulated as the reference product Gonal-f.  
The molecular mass of XM17 was confirmed. Comparative results were shown for XM17 active 
substance reference standard and XM17 finished product.  
Identity of rhFSH was confirmed by immunoblotting. Mass spectrometry of the native separated 
alfa- and beta-subunits of XM17 finished product and active substance confirmed the molecular 
masses of the two subunits.  
The primary structure was studied for all manufactured XM17 active substance batches with N-
terminal sequencing and peptide mapping. Results of sequencing of the N-terminal amino acids 
by means of Edman degradation and peptide mapping confirmed the sequences predicted on the 
basis of literature. In addition, peptide mapping results were shown as part of the comparative 
studies with the reference product. The two glycosylation sites on each subunit were confirmed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 17/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
by the detection of the expected decrease of 1 Da in mass due to deglycosylation of the 
respective glycosylated peptides. 
Results of secondary structure analyses of XM17 showed high homogeneity for different XM17 
batches and were comparable with results from literature.  
Analysis of isoform distribution supported batch-to-batch consistency within different active 
substance batches and to active substance extracted from finished product.  
The distribution was similar for XM17 extracted from finished product and active substance 
batches, indicating batch-to-batch consistency with regard to charged species.  
N-linked glycan distribution in XM17 was determined using intact heterodimeric rhFSH, as well as 
the alfa and beta subunits. The distribution of the native (sialylated) as well as the neutral 
(desialylated) oligosaccharides was determined by means of HPAEC-PAD. Based on the results, 
the total sialic acid content, the ratio Neu5Gc/Neu5Ac, and the antennarity index (AI) were 
determined both for XM17 and Gonal-f.  
Glycans with N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) were detected in XM17 at both glycosylation 
sites studied for both subunits, which was considered as a Major Objection at Day 120: for XM17, 
actual batch analysis results of total sialic acid are higher compared to values measured for 
Gonal-f and to values reported for Puregon.  
A small shift in sialylation was observed, compared to Gonal-f. 
Reference is made to guideline EMEA/CHMP/BWP/49348/2005, where it is stated:  
“It is not expected that the quality attributes in the similar biological and reference medicinal 
products will be identical.  For example, minor structural differences in the active substance, 
such as variability in post-translational modifications may be acceptable, however, must be 
justified. Likewise, differences between the impurity profiles of the similar biological medicinal 
product and the reference medicinal product should be justified and would be considered on a 
case-by-case basis, and supported by the comparability exercise for quality attributes in relation 
to safety and efficacy.  
Therefore, differences in impurity profiles and significant differences in product  related  
substances may  have  consequences with  regard  to  the  amount  of  non-clinical  and  clinical  
data which may  be required in order to make satisfactory justification of the safety and efficacy 
of the similar biological medicinal product”. 
Based on this guidance, the presence of the higher amount of Neu5Gc in XM17 active substance 
had to be justified with appropriate non-clinical and clinical data and biosimilarity had to be 
justified based on quality, pre-clinical and clinical data. The applicant provided additional 
comparative data confirming the already identified difference with the reference product as 
described above. From a quality perspective, this difference is acceptable and is sufficiently 
justified by non-clinical and clinical data. 
Impurities 
All relevant (product- and process-related) impurities have been studied in the characterisation 
studies. In general, impurities were undetectable or occurred at low concentrations.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 18/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Aggregates were characterised using suitable methods. It was considered at Day 120 that 
characterisation and comparability studies should be extended with an orthogonal method for 
(non-covalent) aggregates, for example analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). This method should 
also be used to assess specificity and accuracy/trueness. The requested data were submitted; 
these data did not give rise to specific comments or concerns. 
Potency was established with the Ph. Eur. in vivo rat bioassay (routine control method) and with 
an in vitro cell-based receptor binding assay (only for characterisation). A question was asked 
concerning the validation of the in vitro method. The justification provided, including reference to 
the validation report, was considered sufficient. 
Viral safety 
Two of the downstream manufacturing steps were specifically designed for virus reduction and a 
third step was also validated for viral reduction capacity. Viral reduction studies in validated 
down-scaled models were performed, showing sufficient viral reduction capacity.  
Specifications 
The specifications, method descriptions and summary validation data gave rise to a number of 
points for clarification. Most of these were appropriately resolved. In addition, submitted 
responses on out-of-specification results in the finished product stability studies raised severe 
doubts on the performance of the bioassay (see also below). 
A global discussion on the specifications and choice of tests was requested. The specifications 
(including deviations from the draft Ph. Eur. monograph 2286 Follitropin Concentrated Solution) 
were deemed sufficiently justified, with the remark that the applicant performs additional 
characterisation on deamidation. For the time being, the limits were deemed acceptable, given 
the limited number of batches.  
Reference Standards 
An in-house primary reference standard was qualified.  
The applicant made a commitment to appropriately qualify and characterise each new reference 
standard to be released and provided an acceptable analytical characterisation program for the 
qualification of future in-house primary reference standards.  
Container closure system 
The container closure system of the active substance was sufficiently described. 
Stability 
A stability study of three commercial active substance batches was initiated. Results up to 24 
months storage at less than -70°C showed no changes. The applicant proposed an extension of 
the study up to the 36 month time point. This was considered acceptable. 
Accelerated and stress conditions were studied up to 6 months.  
The claimed shelf life of 24 months was deemed sufficiently justified by the data provided.

Formulation development 
Formulation development was extensively described and discussed in the dossier, and a 
formulation development report was submitted as part of this description. The excipients are 
standard for biopharmaceutical preparations; the formulation is based on the reference product 
Gonal-f and another FSH-containing product (Puregon).  
Benzylchloride was demonstrated to be a suitable preservative (no degradation of active 
substance), and that the combination of benzylchloride with benzalkonium is as effective as 
higher content of benzylchloride alone, while this combination is considered to have a better 
safety profile. These arguments are deemed acceptable from a quality viewpoint. 
The control of excipients was sufficiently described and justified. 
Manufacture 
The batch size and batch formula were described.  
An updated flow diagram was provided, unequivocally visualising the manufacturing process.  
Critical IPCs are defined, and upon request, a list of Critical Process Parameters was provided. 
These are sufficiently covered by the validation data and are deemed acceptable. 
The validation strategy is deemed acceptable.  
The applicant was requested to justify its approach to base filling on activity (IU) instead of 
mass. Filling based on mass would normally be preferred, because it is more precise due to the 
high purity of the active substance. This issue was raised as a Major Objection. The applicant was 
requested to change to filling based on mass, with a fixed (target) protein content together with 
a label claim based either on mass or on a nominal activity claim in IU”.  
In response to the Day 180 issue, the applicant implemented the requested change from activity-
based to mass-based filling. The applicant has chosen to implement a label claim in IU. Based on 
comparative studies with Gonal-f the applicant will indicate the concentration as being 600 
IU/mL, which is equivalent to 44 µg/mL. An appropriate specification of nominal (target) protein 
content is set. The label claim is in line with the reference product Gonal-f label claim and the 
Ph.Eur, draft monograph Follitropin Concentrated Solution. 
Once the final Ph.Eur. monograph will become available, the applicant will consider the testing of 
the product accordingly and amend if necessary.  
In relation to this issue, in view of the 3R principles for animal testing and lack of precision of the 
bioassay, the applicant now performs the bioassay only at active substance release and key time 
points of stability studies.  
The applicant was also requested to remove from the dossier one of the facilities responsible for 
the determination of biological activity. 
Specifications 
The final finished product specifications submitted by the applicant are considered acceptable.

Container closure system 
The container closure system was sufficiently described. 
Stability 
The applicant claims a shelf life of two years, when stored at 2-8°C, with the additional option of 
storage at room temperature (not above 25°C) for up to three months. In addition, an in-use 
stability of 28 days at room temperature (not above 25°C) is claimed. 
The stability protocol was sufficiently justified and stability-indicating parameters are 
appropriately identified.  
In addition, supporting data from a limited number of batches is available.  
The applicant claims an in-use period of 28 days at 25°C. This claim is acceptable. 
Comparability with the reference medicinal product 
Characterisation analyses for XM17 have been conducted in parallel with the reference medicinal 
product, Gonal-f, and have confirmed that structure, conformation, impurity profile and potency 
are comparable with those of follitropin alfa/Gonal-f. Results are summarised below.  
Determination of molecular mass, of the integral protein and the individual subunits showed that 
electropherograms obtained for XM17 active substance are qualitatively comparable with those of 
Gonal-f; and spectra and mass calculations for representative XM17 active substance batches are 
comparable with those of Gonal-f batches analysed. 
Peptide mapping demonstrated that molecular masses of peptide fragments were comparable 
between XM17 active substance and Gonal-f. In addition, sequence identity to the expected 
published sequence of follitropin alfa was confirmed further by N-terminal sequencing of XM17 
active substance. 
The secondary structure of follitropin alfa sourced from XM17 and Gonal-f was shown to be 
highly comparable. 
The nature of the complex carbohydrate structure of follitropin alfa was analysed quantitatively 
on the integral protein and on the isolated oligoglycans. The analyses showed that XM17 and 
Gonal-f have similar isoform pattern and antennarity. Small differences were seen in sialylation 
patterns. 
The potency of follitropin alfa was determined by a pharmacopoeial method, which measures the 
dose-dependent enlargement of ovaries in immature rats upon administration of rhFSH. Binding 
of rhFSH to its cognate receptor using a responsive cell line allows side-by-side analysis of XM17 
and Gonal-f in vitro. The results showed that the biological activity of XM17 and Gonal-f were 
similar in vitro and comparable to the in vivo bioassay. 
In comparative analysis of finished products, XM17 and Gonal-f underwent a similar magnitude 
of methionine oxidation. With regard to deamidation, comparative analysis showed no 
deamidation of either XM17 or Gonal-f. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 21/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The differences in Neu5Gc and small shift in sialylation compared to Gonal-f (see above) were 
adequately described and justified and are considered acceptable. 
Overall, the data presented indicate that XM17 appears to be highly similar to Gonal-f. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Overall, the quality of Ovaleap is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved 
recombinant DNA products. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active 
substance are adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well 
characterised with regard to its physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of the-
art methods, and appropriate specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished 
product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is 
controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. Viral safety and the safety concerning 
other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
Biosimilarity with the reference medicinal product Gonal-f has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
From a quality point of view, the observed differences and levels of these differences have been 
well documented and are acceptable. 
The overall quality of Ovaleap is considered acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommended several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Structure of the active substance 
XM17 drug substance (XM17) is a recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH), 
expressed in genetically modified Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.  
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone weighing 22,690 Da, 
the sum of two non-covalently bound subunits, alfa (10,205 Da) and beta (12,485 Da). The alfa 
chain (common to other heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones) has 92 amino acids with 10 
cysteine residues resulting in five disulfide bridges. It has two N-glycosylation sites (Asn 52 and 
Asn 78) and contains three methionine residues. The beta chain, which is specific for r-hFSH, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 22/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
consists of 111 amino acids with 12 cysteine residues resulting in six disulfide bridges. It also has 
two N-glycosylation sites (Asn 7 and Asn 24) and contains one methionine residue. r-hFSH in 
total has four N-glycosylation sites (two glycosylation sites for each subunit); there are no O-
glycosylation sites. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Determination of the biological activity of XM17 (drug product and drug substance) and Gonal-f 
in a cell-based receptor binding assay 
The activity of batches of XM17 (drug product and drug substance) and Gonal-f was determined 
in a cell based receptor binding assay reliant on the response of a CHO cell line which 
constitutively expresses the human FSH receptor and which had been transfected with a cAMP 
responsive element. The activity of this responsive element regulates the transcription of a 
luciferase reporter gene and the resultant luciferase activity is determined photometrically. The 
potency of the different batches was determined in reference to batches of Gonal-f of known and 
defined potency.  
In vivo studies 
Determination of the activity of XM17 (drug product and drug substance) and Gonal-f in the rat 
ovary weight gain assay  
The activities of batches of XM17 (drug substance and drug product) and Gonal-f were 
determined in the rat ovary weight gain assay (Steelman-Pohley assay) as described in the 
European Pharmacopoeia. The assay relies on the administration of three daily subcutaneous 
injections of reference and test FSH preparations, in combination with a fixed dose of chorionic 
gonadotrophin, to immature female rats. The animals are sacrificed 24 hours after the last 
administration and the ovaries excised and weighed. Fixed doses of reference and test FSH 
preparations were used and the potency of the test preparation relative to that of the reference 
agent was determined by parallel line assay based on the mean of the absolute weights of the 
combined ovaries for each treatment group. The assay was conducted with either the NIBSC 
standard 92/642 or the internal reference standard as reference material. Initial studies of XM17 
drug substance were tested in comparison to the NIBSC standard. The in-house internal 
reference standard was established by testing in comparison to the NIBSC standard in a series of 
7 individual assays and was subsequently used for testing of later batches of XM17 drug 
substance. XM17 drug product and Gonal-f were initially tested in comparison to the NIBSC 
standard with later tests using the internal reference standard. Across a series of 7 individual 
assays, the mean specific activity was determined. This method is routinely used to determine 
the relative potency of batches of XM17 drug substance and also for XM17 drug product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 23/72 
 
 
 
  
  
In addition to the data of the internal reference standard, data from several batches of XM17 
drug substance are included in this report, together with results for XM17 drug product and 
Gonal-f. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with XM17 by the applicant. The 
pharmacological profile of hFSH is well known and it is considered unnecessary to investigate any 
secondary pharmacodynamic effects of XM17. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies with XM17 have investigated potential effects on three body 
systems – CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory.  
Central nervous system (CNS)  
Effects on the CNS were investigated through a modified Irwin behavioural screen conducted as 
an integral part of the single dose toxicity study. Groups of 5 male and 5 female rats received 
vehicle or XM17, 5000 IU/kg subcutaneously with a further 5 animals/sex being dosed 
intraperitoneally with caffeine, 30 mg/kg, acting as positive controls for the Irwin test. There was 
no observable neurobehavioural effect of XM17, whereas caffeine exerted the expected effects 
and thus confirmed the sensitivity of the test system. 
Cardiovascular system (CV) 
Effects on the CV system were investigated in telemetered conscious female Beagle dogs dosed 
subcutaneously with vehicle or 10, 50 or 100 IU/kg of XM17 according to an escalating design 
with a minimum washout period of 48 hours between control and low dose and a minimum of 7 
days between low and mid doses and between mid and high doses. Treatment with XM17 had no 
effect on arterial blood pressure, heart rate or ECG. Analysis of circulating XM17 following the 
100 IU/kg dose showed mean serum levels of 11.8, 14.3 and 11.3 ng/mL at 1, 16 and 24 hours 
after dosing, respectively: these values are comparable to those observed at the same dose level 
in the toxicity study, and considerably higher than the Cmax of 9.184 IU/L (corresponding to 
approximately 0.6 ng/mL) observed in women after a single subcutaneous injection of 300 IU of 
XM17. 
Respiratory system 
The effect on respiratory parameters was monitored in female Wistar rats by whole body 
plethysmography: animals were dosed subcutaneously with vehicle or 10, 100 or 1000 IU/kg of 
XM17 with a further group acting as positive control (receiving 1 mg/kg of carbamylcholine 
chloride subcutaneously). XM17 did not induce any relevant changes in respiratory parameters 
(respiratory rate, peak inspiratory and expiratory flows, inspiration and expiration times, airway 
resistance index, tidal volume and minute volume). Under the same conditions, carbamylcholine 
chloride exerted the expected bronchoconstriction. Direct monitoring of serum levels of XM17 
was not included in this study, but data from the first day of dosing in the 14-day toxicity study 
in female Wistar rats show the dose of 1000 IU/kg to give a Cmax of 86.5 ng/mL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 24/72 
 
 
 
  
  
Taken together, the safety pharmacology studies show XM17 to be devoid of effects on the 
central nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems at doses, and exposures, far in excess of 
those used or achieved clinically. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with XM17. 
Recombinant hFSH has been available clinically for a number of years and possible interactions 
based on its pharmacological activity are well recognised and reflected in the Summaries of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) for the reference medicinal product, Gonal-f and for the other 
existing r-hFSH product Puregon (Merck-Serono, 1995; Organon, 1996). Thus, concomitant use 
of other products used to stimulate ovulation (for example hCG or clomiphene citrate) may 
potentiate the follicular response, whereas pituitary desensitisation through administration of a 
GnRH agonist or antagonist may increase the dose of XM17 needed to obtain an adequate 
ovarian response.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Non-clinical studies were performed to characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of XM17 in 
animals in comparison to the reference product, Gonal-f. Pharmacokinetics of Ovaleap and 
Gonal-f were compared in a rat study where both males and females were administered a 
subcutaneous dose of 10, 70 or 500 IU/kg/day for 7 days. The pharmacokinetic profile of both 
products as expressed by Cmax, AUC, t½, CL and Vz was similar. 
Additional toxicokinetic data obtained in the 28-day repeated-dose toxicology study in rats 
generally supported comparability of both products, but measurements were too limited to base 
firm conclusions upon. Lower FSH levels at the end of the study in high dose animals treated 
with XM17 as compared to Gonal-f treated animals are possibly related to the higher anti-FSH 
antibody titers in the XM17-treated animals. Other toxicokinetic data obtained in 14-day 
repeated dose toxicology studies with XM17 in rats and dogs are not relevant for a comparability 
exercise.

XM17 and Gonal-f, pre-dose corrected

Methods of analysis 
Method of analysis for hFSH  
Assays  of  serum  levels  of  circulating  hFSH  in  all  studies  were  using  a  validated  ELISA  method 
developed for analysis of hFSH in rat, dog and human.  
Method of analysis for ADA (anti-drug antibodies)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 26/72 
 
 
  
  
Anti-hFSH antibodies in rat and dog serum were also assayed by ELISA using a validated assay. 
The  validation  was  extended  to  include  the  assay  of  samples  from  Gonal-f  treated  rats  in  the 
comparative 28-day repeat dose toxicity study.  
Absorption 
Comparative data on the pharmacokinetics of XM17 and Gonal-f are primarily available from the 
7-day  repeat  dose  study in  rats  which  was  conducted  with this  specific  aim, but  supplementary 
information is also available from the 28-day comparative toxicity study in rats. 
The data from the 7-day comparative PK study in male and female rats show XM17 and Gonal-f 
to have very similar pharmacokinetic behaviour. Data from the 28-day comparative toxicity study 
in male and female rats also show comparative values for XM17 and Gonal-f. 
Distribution 
No specific distribution studies have been conducted with XM17. The data generated during the 
comparative 7-day pharmacokinetic study in male and female rats showed similar profiles for 
XM17 and Gonal-f, the reference product. The parameters determined included the volume of 
distribution which was similar for the two products. Given the absence of any indication of 
differences in pharmacokinetic behaviour between XM17 and Gonal-f, it is considered acceptable 
not to have conducted specific distribution studies with XM17. 
Metabolism 
No specific metabolism studies have been conducted with XM17. The metabolism of XM17 would 
be expected to follow that of endogenous proteins. The data generated during the comparative 
7-day pharmacokinetic study in male and female rats showed similar profiles for XM17 and 
Gonal-f, the reference product. Given the absence of any indication of differences in 
pharmacokinetic behaviour between XM17 and Gonal-f and in view of the known degradation 
pathways of endogenous proteins, it is considered acceptable not to have conducted specific 
metabolism studies with XM17.  
Excretion 
No specific excretion studies have been conducted with XM17. The data generated during the 
comparative 7-day pharmacokinetic study in male and female rats showed similar profiles for 
XM17 and Gonal-f, the reference product. The parameters determined included clearance which 
was similar for the two products. Given the absence of any indication of differences in 
pharmacokinetic behaviour between XM17 and Gonal-f, it is considered acceptable not to have 
conducted specific clearance studies with XM17. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No specific interaction studies have been conducted with XM17. The data generated during the 
comparative 7-day pharmacokinetic study in male and female rats showed similar profiles for 
XM17 and Gonal-f, the reference product. The only recognised interactions are pharmacodynamic 
rather than pharmacokinetic and this is appropriately reflected in the product SmPC. Given the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 27/72 
 
  
  
absence of any indication of differences in pharmacokinetic behaviour between XM17 and Gonal-
f, and the recognised absence of pharmacokinetic interactions with Gonal-f, it is considered 
acceptable not to have conducted specific interaction studies with XM17. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
A single dose toxicity study was performed in rats using with 5000 IU/kg XM17. No effects were 
observed, including measurements of weights of spleen, thymus, ovaries and brain when animals 
were necropsied after 14 days. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
The repeat-dose toxicity programme for XM17 consisted of three studies – two 2-week studies in 
female rats and dogs with XM17 alone and a 28-day study in male and female rats comparing 
the effects of XM17 with those of the reference product, Gonal-f. All studies included a recovery 
period for control and high-dose animals after the end of treatment. Sampling for toxicokinetics 
was included in all studies, with assay of serum samples for circulating FSH and anti-rhFSH 
antibodies by ELISA. 
The most notable effects seen in rats and dogs repeat-dose toxicity studies were changes in the 
ovaries. In rats, ovary weights increased in a dose-related manner, starting at the lowest dose 
(10 IU/kg/day). Also, the ovaries were enlarged and the number of follicular cysts increased. In 
dogs, ovary weights were only significantly increased at 50 IU/kg/day while the number of 
multilocular follicular cysts increased in a dose-related manner starting from 50 IU/kg/day. 
Furthermore, in dogs, the uterus was enlarged from this dose and at doses above and the 
incidence of oestrous uterus showed an increase at all doses tested. These observations 
obviously reflect the pharmacological activity of rFSH in these animals. 
In rats, body weights were slightly increased in females from 100 IU/kg/day and food 
consumption was transiently increased. Other effects seen in rats were slight changes in protein, 
albumin, glucose and haematological parameters, decreases in total bilirubin and increase in liver 
weight. Except for the decrease in bilirubin these effects were absent at the end of the recovery 
periods and are not considered to be of toxicological relevance. 
In both rats and dogs, a dose-related increase in the incidence and titer of anti-rhFSH antibodies 
was observed. 
Only the 4-week study in rats was designed in a way that may contribute to the comparability 
exercise, as in this study XM17 and Gonal-f were tested in a comparative way. Mostly, effects 
observed with XM17 and Gonal-f were qualitatively similar. Slight quantitative differences, 
including slight differences in incidence of cysts in the ovaries and corpora lutea hyperplasia were 
considered incidental.  
Ovaries weights increased dose-dependently and comparably in rats treated with XM17 or Gonal-
f. In the 4-week comparative repeated-dose toxicity study in rats a high incidence of local 
reactions at the injection site was observed, mainly chronic inflammation and haemorrhages.

Although these data are not fully consistent with the conclusion that local tolerance is good, it 
should be considered that an inflammatory response to a human recombinant protein in animals 
is not predictive for a response in humans and that clinically, local tolerance was acceptable and 
comparable. 
Genotoxicity Carcinogenicity and Reproductive toxicity  
Studies on genotoxicity and carcinogenicity have not been performed, which has been sufficiently 
justified by the Applicant. This is in accordance with both the ICH S6 guideline on the 
development of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (Note for guidance on preclinical safety 
evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals; CPMP/ICH/302/95) and the CHMP guideline 
on the development of biosimilar products (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substances: non-clinical and clinical issues; 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005). 
Studies on Reproductive Toxicity have not been perfomed, both for the well-known mechanism of 
action of FSH and in accordance with the CHMP guideline on the development of biosimilar 
products (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived 
proteins as active substances: non-clinical and clinical issues; EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005). 
Local tolerance 
Subsequently, the local tolerance of XM17 in a concentration of 600 IU/ml was tested in 
comparison to 0.9% saline in 6 female New Zealand White rabbits after a single paravenous, 
subcutaneous and intramuscular administration of a volume of 0.5 ml (paravenous, resulting in 
300 IU/animal) or 0.75 ml (subcutaneous and intramuscular, resulting in 450 IU/animal). 
Paravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular administration of the test item caused slightly 
increased erythema and edema formation within 72 h when compared to the administration of 
saline. No drug-related macroscopic and histological findings were observed.  
Based on these results of this study it is concluded that a single administration of XM17 (600 
IU/ml) in a dose of 450 IU/animal is well tolerated in female NZW rabbits after subcutaneous 
injection. Furthermore, it is concluded that all irritations seen after single paravenous and 
intramuscular administration of XM17 (600 IU/ml) are within a tolerable range. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data are available from a 28-day comparative toxicity study in the rat. Specific PK 
studies with XM17 alone have not been conducted but toxicokinetic data are available, on the 
first and last days of dosing, from 14-day repeat dose toxicity studies in the rat and dog. 
Other toxicity studies 
No other studies were performed.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
XM17 is a recombinant glycoprotein without linkers or any other modifications and has the same 
structure and activity as endogenous FSH. FSH is a pituitary hormone that controls the 
reproductive system in both males and females. 
Given the characteristics above, the performance of specific studies for Environmental Risk 
Assessment was not requested as proteins are biodegradable in the environment.  
Therefore, XM17 is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
For a biosimilar recombinant FSH the most relevant property both in terms of efficacy and safety 
(in relation to the propensity to cause OHSS) is comparable biological activity. Receptor affinity 
studies showed comparable binding of Gonal-f and Ovaleap to the human FSH receptor. KD 
values were 0.334 and 0.344 nM for Gonal-f and Ovaleap, respectively. In a cell-based assay 
employing human FSH-receptor expressing CHO cells, both products showed comparable 
biological activity. The Applicant provided the results from the Steelman-Pohley assay, a 
pharmacopoeial assay in rats covering both PD and PK aspects. However this assay is known to 
show high inter-animal variability and has therefore its limitations for a comparability exercise. 
Safety pharmacology studies show XM17 to be devoid of effects on the central nervous, 
cardiovascular and respiratory systems.  
A short-term study in rats showed comparable pharmacokinetic behaviour of both products.  
Additional comparative data obtained in the 28-day repeated dose toxicology study also supports 
the pharmacokinetic comparability, although high dose serum concentrations on day 14 and day 
28 for males and on day 28 for females were higher for Gonal-f than for Ovaleap. 
The most notable effects seen in rats and dogs repeat-dose toxicity studies were changes in the 
ovaries. These observations obviously reflect the pharmacological activity of rFSH in these 
animals. 
Limited toxicokinetic data in a 28-day comparative toxicology study in rats suggest some 
differences in serum FSH levels at the end of this study. Lower FSH levels at the end of the study 
in some high dose or mid-dose animals treated with XM17 or high dose Gonal-f treated animals 
are possibly related to the higher anti-FSH antibody titers, which may be the cause for lower 
ovary weights at the end of treatment in these animals. However, overall the correlation between 
FSH levels anti-FSH titers and pharmacodynamic outcome was poor. Possibly, slight differences 
in quality attributes affected immunogenicity in rats. However, this finding does not reveal which 
differences are responsible for an apparent difference in immunogenic potential in rats. As XM17 
and Gonal-f are recombinant human proteins, an immunogenic response in animals is expected 
and is not considered predictive of a human response. Therefore these observed differences in 
animals are not considered relevant for the evaluation of comparability of Ovaleap and Gonal-f in 
humans.

The Phase III study was conducted in 5 countries: Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary 
and Poland. 
The Phase III study XM17-05 is the pivotal study in this submission. 
-  Follow-up Part A: Women who became pregnant in the main study were followed up until they 
gave birth. 
-  Follow-up  Part  B:  Women  who  did  not  become  pregnant  in  the  main  study  could  receive 
Ovaleap as the follicle stimulating drug for up to 2 additional cycles. 
At the time of preparation of this marketing authorization application, there were no other 
ongoing clinical studies with Ovaleap. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone. Recombinant human 
follicle stimulating hormones (r-hFSH) have the same amino acid sequence as the natural human 
FSH but may differ in their glycosylation patterns. It has been shown that the pharmacokinetic 
(PK) characteristics of r-hFSH in humans are similar to those of urinary FSH.  
The XM17 is being developed as a “similar biological medicinal product” according to Article 10 
(4) and Annex 1, Part II, Chapter 4 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. The XM17 Drug 
Substance is developed to be similar to follitropin alfa (r-hFSH), the active substance used in 
Gonal-f. Therefore Gonal-f has been used as the reference medicinal product in analyses to 
support the claim of biosimilarity throughout development of XM17. 
The XM17 Drug Substance (r-hFSH) is expressed from genetically modified Chinese Hamster 
Ovary (CHO) cells. 
The XM17 is supplied as pre-filled cartridges at strength of 600 IU/mL, at three different 
presentations: 0.5 mL (300 IU), 0.75 mL (450 IU) and 1.5 mL (900 IU). The medicinal product is 
supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection, which is administered using a re-usable CE-
certified pen (not part of the medicinal product). 
The dosage regimen of XM17 is dependent on the indication. In general the actual regimens are 
adapted depending on the response of individual patients: 
In adult women 
─ 
Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been 
unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. A commonly used regimen 
commences at 75-150 IU of hFSH per day increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 
or 14 day intervals until an adequate response is obtained. The maximum daily dose 
is usually not higher than 225 IU. If no adequate response is achieved after 4 weeks 
of treatment the cycle should be abandoned and another cycle with a different 
starting dose should be performed. 
─ 
Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for 
assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization, gamete intra-
fallopian transfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer. The recommended regimen is 
150-225 IU daily, commencing on day 2 or 3 of the cycle and continuing until 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 32/72 
 
  
  
adequate follicular development is achieved, with the dose adjusted according to the 
response but usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular 
development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 
days). 
─ 
XM17 in association with a luteinising hormone preparation is recommended for the 
stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. 
The recommended regimen is 75-150 IU daily increasing as necessary by 37.5-75 IU 
increments at 7-14 day intervals. In each cycle the treatment can be extended up to 
5 weeks. 
In adult men 
─ 
XM17 is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have 
congenital or acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with concomitant human 
chorionic gonadotropin therapy. The recommended regimen is 150 IU three times a 
week for a minimum of 4 months; experience indicated that treatment for 18 
months may be necessary. 
The clinical development programme for XM17 consists of 2 studies comprising pharmacokinetics 
in young healthy female volunteers. One study was a First-in-Man Phase I study (XM17-01), the 
other was a phase I study comparing XM17 and Gonal-f (XM17-02), see table below.

Absorption  
Bioavailability 
Absorption of XM17 was slow as indicated by tmax values ranging from 10 to 168 hours and a 
median tmax of 24 hours in the 3 higher dose groups (study XM17-01, 75 IU, 150 IU, and 300 
IU). The higher median tmax value of 156 hours in the lowest dose group (37.5 IU reflects the 
secondary increase in serum concentrations after 36 hours post-dose. 
Bioequivalence  
In all clinical trials the final commercial formulation of XM17 was investigated, supplied in the 
Phase I trials in vials and in the Phase III trial in cartridges, which were inserted in a CE-marked 
pen for administration. The drug substance used in the first Phase I study (XM17-01) was 
manufactured on a pilot scale, whereas the XM17 Drug Substance used for both comparative 
studies was manufactured on a commercial scale (Merckle Biotec).

Study XM17-02 was a 2-way cross-over bioequivalence study with single s.c. doses of 300 IU of 
XM17 and Gonal-f in healthy female subjects with suppression of endogenous FSH production by 
a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. 
The pre-dose corrected mean concentration–time curves for FSH after administration of a single 
300 IU dose of XM17 or Gonal-f to 36 healthy women were similar; mean values in terms of IU/L 
were almost identical. 
Distribution 
XM17 has shown the biosimilarity to Gonal-f, it is accepted that the plasma protein binding 
characteristics of the two products are comparable. Therefore, studies on plasma protein binding 
were not deemed necessary. 
Elimination 
XM17 has shown the biosimilarity to Gonal-f, therefore, additional studies to assess this issue 
were not deemed necessary. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality was assessed in study XM17-01 using single doses of 37.5 IU, 75 IU, 150 
IU, and 300 IU of XM17 sc. The lowest dose of 37.5 IU was administered to 4 subjects; the 3 
higher doses were administered to 12 subjects each. The mean serum concentration-time 
profiles of XM17 after single s.c. injections of the 3 higher doses of 75, 150, and 300 IU XM17 
(12 subjects per dose group) showed dose-related peak values that occurred within 24 hours 
post-dose. This peak was followed by approximately mono-exponential decay up to 120 hours 
post-dose. 
The mean concentration-time profile after single s.c. injections of 37.5 IU XM17 (4 subjects) also 
showed a primary peak within 24 hours post-dose, but from 36 hours post-dose onwards there 
was a secondary increase up to mean concentrations that were similar to those observed after 
300 IU at 168 hours post-dose. Steady increases in XM17 concentrations after 36 hours post-
dose were observed in 3 of the 4 subjects.  
Geometric mean t½ in the 3 higher dose groups ranged from approximately 54 to 90 hours 
(medians 63 to 77 hours) without a clear relationship to the XM17 dose. There were also no 
apparently dose-related differences in the subjects’ geometric mean or median CL/f and Vz/f 
values. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Specific studies to investigate pharmacokinetics in patients have not been performed. The PK 
studies XM17-01 and XM17-02 provide PK data in healthy female subjects. As the patients 
treated with XM17 are mainly healthy young women with fertility disorders only, the PK data 
generated in these two studies can also be regarded as relevant for the patients.

Special populations 
Impaired hepatic/renal function 
Not applicable.  
Studies specifically designed to investigate the hepatic metabolism or potential drug interaction 
of XM17 have not been conducted nor have such standard studies been reported with the 
reference drug Gonal-f. As XM17 is biosimilar to Gonal-f the data available for Gonal-f will apply. 
Therefore drug-drug-interaction studies were not deemed necessary. This is in accordance with 
the recent draft guidance on similar biological medicinal products containing r hFSH 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010). 
Race/Weight 
Not applicable.  
Studies specifically designed to investigate the effects of intrinsic factors on the PK of XM17 have 
not been conducted. The XM17 showed bioequivalence to Gonal-f in the PK-study XM17-02. 
Elderly/Children 
The patients to be treated with XM17 will not be elderly or children, thus the influence of age is 
regarded not relevant. 
Gender 
As XM17 will mainly be used in women, the PK was investigated only in this group. The PK in 
men has been evaluated with Gonal-f. Single dose PK of Gonal-f was determined following 
subcutaneous administration of 225 IU Gonal-f to 12 healthy adult male volunteers. Steady state 
PK were also determined in 6 healthy adult male volunteers who were administered a single daily 
dose of 225 IU Gonal-f for 7 days. No significant difference in PK is expected in males versus 
females when Gonal-f is administered subcutaneously.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Studies specifically designed to investigate the effects of extrinsic factors on the PK of XM17 
have not been conducted. As XM17 is being developed as a similar biological medicinal product 
to Gonal-f, such studies were not necessary. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No separate pharmacodynamic study was conducted. The pharmacodynamic parameters were 
taken into account in one Phase III trial XM17-05 comparing Ovaleap with Gonal-f in patients 
undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. The measured serum levels were: FSH, oestradiol, 
Luteinising Hormone (LH) and progesterone. In public literature, FSH administration has been 
reported to increase plasma concentrations of FSH, oestradiol and inhibin-B, but without 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 35/72 
 
  
  
significant changes in the LH plasma concentrations4. Both oestradiol and inhibin-B are reported 
to correlate with the number of follicles seen on ovarian ultrasound 5,6. 
In addition, other pharmacodynamic parameters taken into account were ‘total r-hFSH dose’, 
‘number of days of r-hFSH stimulation’ and ‘number and size of follicles’ these are closely linked 
to the primary endpoint of the Phase III trial ‘number of oocytes retrieved’. 
In trial XM17-05 pituitary down-regulation was achieved with the gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist Metrelef (buserelin acetate) nasal spray approved in Germany. The 
patient received a fixed subcutaneous dose of 150 IU of rFSH (either Gonal-f or Ovaleap) once 
daily for 5 days. The subcutaneous rFSH dose could be reduced or increased from Stimulation 
Day 6 on to achieve adequate follicular development. Following confirmation of adequate 
follicular development (≥ 3 follicles with 17 mm, oestradiol < 5500 pg/mL), hCG was to be 
administered for final follicular maturation and triggering of ovulation. 
Based on LH and FSH levels, adequate down-regulation was achieved in both groups. The 
progesterone concentrations differed slightly on the day of hCG administration with a slightly 
higher concentration in the Ovaleap group (median 1.015 ng/mL versus 0.920 ng/mL). 
Also, a small difference in oestradiol concentrations was noted at Stimulation Day 6, i.e. after the 
end of the fixed-dose treatment of five days. The concentration in the Ovaleap group was slightly 
higher (median 350.3 pg/mL for Gonal-f versus 479.6 pg/mL for Ovaleap). However, this 
difference was less apparent at the end of the treatment period on the day of hCG administration 
(median 2176.5 pg/mL for Gonal-f versus 2242.5 pg/mL for Ovaleap). 
Phase III study (XM17-05) 
Design 
Women aged 18-37 years undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) were randomized to 
daily injections of Gonal-f (n=146) or Ovaleap (n=153). Pituitary down-regulation was achieved 
with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist Metrelef (buserelin acetate) nasal 
spray, approved in Germany. The patient received a fixed subcutaneous dose of 150 IU of rFSH 
(either Gonal-f or Ovaleap) once daily for 5 days. The subcutaneous rFSH dose could be reduced 
or increased from Stimulation Day 6 on to achieve adequate follicular development. Following 
confirmation of adequate follicular development (≥ 3 follicles with 17 mm, oestradiol < 5500 
pg/mL), hCG (Ovitrelle) was to be administered for final follicular maturation and triggering of 
ovulation.

Results

• 
FSH: Treatment with Metrelef resulted in adequate down-regulation in both groups. 
Between the enrolment visit and the start of the fixed-dose treatment, the median FSH 
concentration decreased from 6.9 to 4.6 IU/L in the Gonal-f group and from 6.9 to 4.8 IU/L 
in the XM17 group. 
Oestradiol: Between the enrolment visit and the start of the fixed-dose treatment with r-
hFSH median oestradiol concentrations decreased in both groups as a result of down-
regulation with the GnRH agonist Metrelef (from 47.7 to 27.1 pg/mL in the Gonal-f group 
and from 45.1 to 25.9 pg/mL in the XM17 group). A serum concentration of < 50 pg/mL 
was required for successful down-regulation. The baseline values at the start of r-hFSH 
treatment were comparable in both treatment groups. 
At the end of treatment with the fixed r-hFSH dose on Stimulation Day 6, median 
concentrations had increased to 350.3 and 479.6 pg/mL, respectively. Concentrations 
increased further during the r-hFSH dose adaptation period, reaching 2176.5 pg/mL in the 
Gonal-f group and 2242.5 pg/mL in the XM17 group at the day of hCG administration. The 
change between baseline and end of study was slightly higher in the XM17 group than the 
Gonal-f group (2216.2 vs. 2008.7 pg/mL); this difference was not statistically significant. 
LH: Results at the start of r-FSH treatment confirmed adequate down-regulation (median 
concentration 3.0 IU/L in the Gonal-f group and 2.8 IU/L in the XM17 group). 
Progesterone: On the day of hCG administration, the progesterone concentration in the 
Gonal-f group was slightly lower than in the XM17 group: median 0.920 vs. 1.015 ng/mL, 
mean ± SD 1.013 ± 0.619 vs. 1.132 ± 0.812 ng/mL. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) information is available from the two single-centre, phase I, open-
label  clinical  studies  in  76  healthy  female  subjects  (40  subjects  in  study  XM17-01  and  36 
subjects   in   XM17-02). The dose-proportionality of XM17 was investigated in Study XM17-01. 
In  this  study  single  ascending  doses  of  XM17  (37.5  to  300  IU)  were  administered  to  healthy 
volunteers  after  suppression  of  endogenous  FSH  production  by  a  gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist.    
The      bioequivalence  of  XM17  was  investigated  in  a  cross-over  study  (Study  XM17-02).  In  this 
study  300  IU  of  XM17  and  Gonal-f  were  administered  to  healthy  female  subjects.  Endogenous 
FSH production was suppressed again by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist.

Study  XM17-01  showed that  absorption  of  XM17  is  relatively  slow.  The  median  tmax  was  of  24 
hours  in  the  three  higher dose groups.  Unexpectedly,  the  mean  concentration-time profile  after 
single s. c. injections of 37.5 IU XM17 (4 subjects) also showed a primary peak within 24 hours 
post-dose,  but  from  36  hours  post-dose  onwards  there  was  a  secondary  increase  up  to  mean 
concentrations that were similar to those observed after 300 IU at 168 hours post-dose. Steady 
increases in XM17 concentrations after 36 hours post-dose were observed in 3 of the 4 subjects.  
Study XM17-02 convincingly demonstrated that there is no statistically or clinically relevant 
difference between pre-dose corrected mean serum concentration-time profiles of FSH after 
single s. c. injections of 300 IU XM17 or Gonal-f.   
No separate pharmacodynamic study was performed. The pharmacodynamic parameters were 
taken into account in the Phase III trial XM17-05 comparing Ovaleap with Gonal-f in patients 
undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. Investigating the PD parameters as part of the phase 
III trial is in line with the ‘Draft guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar 
biological medicinal products containing recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-FSH; 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010)’. 
The measurement of serum levels of FSH, oestradiol, LH and Progesterone is considered 
adequate for supporting comparable pharmacodynamics properties of Ovaleap and Gonal-f. In 
the draft guideline EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010 also inhibin-B is indicated as one of the 
pharmacodynamics parameters that should be taken into account. Inhibin-B, as well as 
oestradiol, correlate with the number of follicles seen on ovarian ultrasound. As sufficient other 
pharmacodynamic parameters were measured (oestradiol levels, FSH levels, number and size of 
follicles), the lack of inhibin-B levels is not considered an issue. 
Based on LH and FSH levels, adequate down-regulation was achieved in both groups. 
Based on the oestradiol concentrations, Ovaleap is considered slightly more potent than Gonal-f, 
as shown in the initial fixed dose period of 6 days. However, the difference is considered small, 
and at the end of the treatment period on the day of hCG administration, this difference was less 
apparent. Further, there is large variation between the treated patients in oestradiol levels. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The serum levels of FSH, oestradiol, LH and Progesterone are considered adequate for supporting 
comparable pharmacodynamic properties of Ovaleap and Gonal-f. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Proof of clinical efficiency was based on one phase III study XM17-05 to support efficacy and 
safety.

Objectives

The primary objective was to demonstrate the equivalence of Ovaleap compared to Gonal-f with 
respect to the primary efficacy endpoint of the ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ in infertile but 
ovulatory women undergoing superovulation for ART. 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria 
infertile female patients of any racial origin undergoing superovulation for ART; 
• 
•  aged 18-37 years (inclusive) at the time of enrolment; 
•  BMI between 18-29 kg/m2 inclusive; 
•  regular menstrual cycle length: 21-35 days and presumed to be ovulatory; 
Exclusion criteria  
•  more than 2 previously completed consecutive unsuccessful IVF cycles (i.e. completed cycle = 
oocyte retrieval); 
•  primary ovarian failure or women known as poor responders; 
•  more than 3 miscarriages; 
•  history of a severe OHSS; 
•  malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; 
•  ovarian enlargement or cysts of more than 2 cm; 
•  history of coagulation disorders; 
•  Patients fulfilling any of the following exclusion criteria at Visit 3 could not be randomised to 
study treatment: 
─ Serum oestradiol ≥ 50 pg/mL (approximately 200 pmol/L, local laboratory) 
─ Ovarian cysts > 10 mm (verified by ultrasound) 
 ─ Positive pregnancy test (β-hCG test) 
Treatments  
Patient eligibility was assessed at the enrolment visit. In eligible patients, pituitary down-
regulation was to be started with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist Metrelef 
(buserelin acetate) at about Day 21 of the patient cycle. The GnRH agonist Metrelef is marketed 
by Ferrring Arzneimittel Gmbh in Germany and is intended for nasal use. Dosing had to be 
performed according to the package leaflet. The initial daily dose was 4 puffs (equal to 0.6 mg 
buserelin) distributed over the day. Due to inadequate suppression, doses of up to 8 puffs (equal 
to 1.2 mg buserelin) distributed over the day were allowed. The patient received a fixed 
subcutaneous dose of 150 IU of rFSH once daily for 5 days. The subcutaneous rFSH dose could 
be reduced or increased from Stimulation Day 6 on to achieve adequate follicular development. 
The investigator decided whether this was required based on serum oestradiol levels and 
ultrasound examinations. Adjustments were to be made no more than every 3 to 5 days in steps 
of 37.5 IU or multiples of 37.5 IU, but no more than 150 IU at each adjustment. Doses greater 
than 450 IU/day were not recommended. Due to a risk of OHSS the investigator could decide to 
withhold rFSH for a defined time period (coasting). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 39/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Following confirmation of adequate follicular development (≥ 3 follicles with 17 mm, oestradiol < 
5500 pg/mL), hCG (Ovitrelle) was to be administered for final follicular maturation and triggering 
of ovulation (Visit 5). Luteal phase support was given at the discretion of the investigator and not 
standardised for all patients. Oocyte retrieval (Visit 6) was to take place 34 to 37 hours after 
administration of hCG. Biochemical pregnancy (β-hCG test) was to be evaluated at Visit 7 not 
earlier than 16 days (around 16 to 19 days) after oocyte retrieval and clinical pregnancy 
(gestational sac with heart activity) at Visit 8 approximately 5 to 7 weeks after oocyte retrieval. 
A blood sample for antibody testing was to be taken at Visit 9, 3 months after oocyte retrieval. 
An end of main study Visit for assessment of safety and tolerability was performed as the final 
visit for patients who terminated the study prematurely after start of XM17/Gonal-f treatment, 
had a negative pregnancy test at Visit 7, or attended Visit 8. 
Rationale for the rFSH dose for the fixed dose phase (Stimulation Day 1 till 5): 
The doses were selected based on the ones used for Gonal-F and were in line with common 
practice for randomised, controlled trials in ART (see figure 3 below).

Study endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the “number of oocytes retrieved is in accordance with the draft 
guideline EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010. This endpoint is considered an adequate endpoint,

as it is strongly influenced by the effect of FSH on the ovaries, and at the same time represents 
an endpoint of clinical relevance.

Randomisation 
It was done by central remote allocation using an Interactive Voice Response telephone System 
(IVRS). Randomization was stratified per centre, using blocks of two. The size of the 
randomisation blocks was not disclosed in the study protocol or to the study centres. 
Blinding 
A double-blind design was not technically feasible for this study. Ovaleap was provided in 
cartridges that had to be inserted into a special pen (medical device). Gonal-f was provided as a 
solution for injection in a pre-filled pen that already contained the cartridge with the medication. 
As the pen for Gonal-f was patent protected, the Applicant indicated that it was not possible to 
produce an identical pen for Ovaleap. Blinding of the patient was not possible, because the study 
medication was self-administered. To maintain the study blind for the investigator, co-
investigator, and the embryologist, an appropriately medically qualified, “independent”, third 
party drug administrator (e.g. physician or nurse) was appointed in each centre. The physician 
treating the patient and performing all assessments was kept blinded and was not involved in 
any aspects of the study medication. The investigator decided on any dose changes of r-hFSH 
based on oestradiol levels and ultrasound examinations, and informed the drug administrator to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 41/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
perform these dose changes. The drug administrator communicated this information to the 
patient. 
Statistical methods 
The equivalence margin for the primary endpoint ‘number of oocytes’ retrieved was -3 and +3 
oocytes and is adequately justified. The equivalence margin for Ovaleap [-3, +3] is tighter than 
has been used in the registered Elonva (modified r-hFSH with a longer half-life) equivalence 
trial comparing Elonva with r-hFSH (Puregon [-3, +5]). The sample size has a 90% power for 
rejecting the null hypothesis that Ovaleap is different to Gonal-f with an equivalence margin of -
3, +3, which is appropriate. 
The ZIP regression analysis model used for the analysis of the primary endpoint in the study 
specifically takes data with excess zeroes into account. This is important, as overstimulation as 
well as under stimulation can result in cycle cancellation and a number of zeroes oocytes 
retrieved. Additionally, four exploratory analyses were performed to check the robustness of the 
estimated treatment effect: 
1) 
ZIP regression model used for main analysis but with interaction terms between 
2) 
3) 
treatment and country, between treatment and age. 
Unadjusted ZIP regression model with only treatment as fixed effect. 
Poisson regression model with treatment and country as fixed factors and age as a 
covariate only for patients with performed oocytes retrieval. This includes patients with 
performed retrieval but no oocytes retrieved. 
4) 
ANCOVA with treatment and country as fixed effects and age as explanatory variable. 
Sample size  
‘Number of oocytes retrieved’ was the primary endpoint on which the comparison was based in 
order to establish equivalence versus Gonal-f. The sample size was determined to provide a 
power of at least 0.9 for rejection of the null hypothesis for the primary efficacy variable at a 
two-sided level of α = 0.05 for the main analysis.  
A sample size of 124 patients per group was necessary to have a 90% power for rejecting the 
null hypothesis that Ovaleap is different to Gonal-f (i.e. the difference in the expected mean 
number of oocytes is larger than ∆ = 3 oocytes) in favour of the alternative hypothesis that 
Ovaleap is equivalent to Gonal-f, assuming that the expected difference in the expected mean 
number of oocytes is ≤ 0.5 oocytes and the common SD is 6 oocytes.7,8,9

about 10% of patients treated with r-hFSH would have major protocol violations.

Recruitment 
The dates of first and last subject observation were 19 March 2010 and 27 January 2011, 
respectively. 
Conduct of the study 
In the case of Follow-up Parts A and B, interim analyses were introduced by protocol amendment 
No. 1 for the provision of data on the follow-up of pregnant women and patients treated with 
several cycles of XM17 at the time of marketing authorisation application. These data were 
requested from the EMA in the Scientific Advice. These analyses are described in separate 
Statistical Analysis Plans and reports. 
Major protocol violations  
Occurred in 2 patients (1 in each treatment group) due to dose adaptation of study medication in 
the fixed dose period. Both patients received 225 IU instead of 150 IU of r-FSH on Stimulation 
Day 5. 
Minor protocol violations 
Occurred in 57 (19.1%) patients of the ITT population: 28 (19.2%) Gonal-f patients, 29 (19.0%) 
Ovaleap patients. The most frequent minor protocol violations were related to the additional 
exclusion criteria for inadequate down-regulation at Visit 3 (12 Gonal-f patients, 12 Ovaleap 
patients), inclusion criteria (10 vs. 7 patients) and hCG administration (7 vs. 9 patients).

Baseline data  
The overall mean age, body weight and body mass index were 31.6 years, 63.5 kg, and 22.7 
kg/m2, respectively. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The mean ± SD age overall was 31.6 ± 3.2 years and comparable between the treatment 
groups. The percentage of women older than 34 years was slightly higher in the Gonal-f 
group than in the XM17/Ovaleap group (24.0% vs. 16.3%) and the percentage aged 
between 30 to 34 years was lower (51.4% vs. 60.8%). 
Basal counts of antral follicles ≥ 5 mm for the right and left ovaries were similar across the 
treatment groups. 
Mean total ovarian volume was slightly lower in the Gonal-f group than in the XM17 group 
(15.5 ± 11.8 mL vs. 19.0 ± 50.7 mL) but median values were similar (12.6 vs. 12.0 mL). 
Ethnic origin was Caucasian in all but 2 patients: 1 patient in the Gonal-f group was 
classified as Hispanic and 1 patient in the XM17 group as Asian. 
Demographic characteristics of the ATP population were similar to those of the ITT population 
(see table 11).

Medical history of infertility 
The mean overall duration of infertility before the study was 45.1 ± 27.6 months and 281 
(94.0%) of the women had been infertile for over a year. The mean period between diagnosis of 
fertility and study entry was 23.7 ± 24.4 months. A higher percentage of women in the Gonal-f 
group than in the XM17 group reported previous pregnancies (34.9% vs. 29.4%) and previous 
miscarriages (24.0% vs. 14.4%). The proportion of live births was slightly higher in the XM17 
group (17.6% vs. 13.7% in the Gonal-f group). The percentage of women that received previous 
treatment with ICSI + IVF was 41.1% in the Gonal-f group and 37.3% in the Ovaleap group. 
Causal factors 
The profile of causal factors for infertility was similar in the two treatment groups (see Table 12). 
Male factor was by far the most common cause (54.5% patients in the ITT population), followed 
by idiopathic causes (26.8%), tubal factor (18.7%), and endometriosis (6.7%). Other factors 
were reported as the cause in 16 (5.4%) patients which was unexplained in 12 of these patients; 
in the 4 remaining patients, the cause was specified as status post extrauterine (tubal) 
pregnancy (Gonal-f), myoma (Gonal-f), polycystic ovary syndrome (Gonal-f), and cervical factor 
(XM17). 
Table 12 
Causal factors for infertility (ITT population) 
Numbers analysed 
Two patients with major protocol violations were excluded from the ATP population. Efficacy 
analyses were performed on both the ATP and ITT populations. Results for these two populations 
are almost identical, as they only differed by 2 patients (297 vs. 299 patients). 
In total, 276 (92.3%) of the 299 randomised and treated patients completed the main study: 
134 (91.8%) patients in the Gonal-f group and 142 (92.8%) patients in the XM17 group). 
The most common primary reasons for discontinuation were no embryo transferred (1 Gonal-f 
patient vs. 5 XM17 patients), no oocytes fertilised (4 vs. 1 patient), and other reasons (3 vs. 1 
patient). In the Gonal-f group, “other” primary reasons for discontinuation were as follows: 1 
patient had only 1 follicle and was lost to follow-up, one patient did not undergo embryo transfer 
in order to prevent OHSS, and one patient did not meet the criteria for hCG administration 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 48/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
between Visits 4 and 5. In the XM17 group, one patient was withdrawn due to risk of OHSS. In 2 
patients the primary reason for withdrawal was an AE (OHSS). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy analysis 
For patients without oocyte retrieval a value of “0” was imputed (3 ATP patients, 4 ITT patients). 
The mean (SD) number of ooctyes retrieved in the ATP group was 12.0 (6.8) for the Gonal-f 
group and 12.2 (6.8) for the XM17 group (Table 13). Values without imputation were almost 
identical to those with imputation: 12.1 (6.7) and 12.2 (6.8), respectively. 
The estimated treatment difference was 0.03 oocytes in favour of XM17, while the 95% 
confidence interval was [-0.76; 0.82]. This indicates that the two treatment groups were 
equivalent based on the pre-defined equivalence range of (-3, +3) oocytes. Results for the ITT 
population were comparable. 
The model showed that age and country had a statistically significant effect on the number of 
oocytes (p <0.001). This was not the case for randomised study treatment (p = 0.940). 
Table 13 
Number of oocytes retrieved (ATP population) 
Sensitivity analyses 
Four exploratory analyses were performed to check the robustness of the estimated treatment 
effect found in the main analysis. See for details the paragraph statistical methods above. All 
four exploratory analyses satisfied the pre-specified limit of [-3 oocytes, +3 oocytes]. 
Secondary efficacy analysis 
The mean (median) total dose of r-FSH was 1535.8 (1425) in the XM17 group and 1614.3 
(1500) IU in the Gonal-f group. The mean (median) number of days of r-FSH stimulation was 
slightly lower in the XM17 group than in the Gonal-f group: 9.3 (9) days vs. 9.7 (10) days. The 
majority of patients received r-FSH stimulation for 8 to 11 days: 80.4% in the XM17 group and 
82.9% in the Gonal-f group. The proportion of patients requiring dose adaptations was slightly 
lower in the XM17 group (51.0%) than the Gonal-f group (58.2%). This was due to a lower 
frequency of dose increases (35.9% vs. 43.2%).

A total of 136 patients completed the study without adaptation of the r-hFSH dose: 61 (42%) in 
the Gonal-f group and 75 (49%) in the XM17 group. The number of oocytes retrieved in patients 
with no r-hFSH adaptation was similar between the treatment groups, 12.5 and 11.9, 
respectively. The number of follicles (≤ 10 mm, > 10 to 14 mm, > 14 to 17 mm, > 17 mm) on 
Stimulation Day 6 (Visit 4) prior to dose adaptation and at the end of r-FSH treatment (Visit 5) 
was evaluated. At Visit 4, the frequency of patients with follicles >14 mm was higher in the XM17 
group than in the Gonal-f group (27% vs. 14%); frequencies at the end of treatment after dose 
adaptation were comparable (93% vs. 94%).  
The serum oestradiol levels on Stimulation Day 6 prior to dose adaptation were very variable and 
the mean concentration was higher in the XM17 group than in the Gonal-f group (650.2 vs. 
516.3 pg/mL). Endometrial thickness (mm) on Stimulation Day 6 prior to dose adaptation was 
comparable in both groups: 8.0 for Gonal-f and 8.2 for XM17. The number of follicles > 14 mm 
on the day of hCG injection was comparable in both treatment groups (10.5 in the Gonal-f group 
and 10.8 in the XM17 group) as well as serum oestradiol levels on the day of hCG injection 
(2598.5 pg/mL for Gonal-F and 2744.3 for XM17) and endometrial thickness (mm) on the day of 
hCG injection was similar in both treatment groups (10.9 mm). 
The majority of the patients (77.9%) underwent ICSI procedures: 74.7% of patients in the 
Gonal-f group and 81.0% in the XM17 group. 14.0% of the patients underwent IVF procedures 
and 6.4% underwent both ICSI and IVF. The profiles of oocyte maturity (in subjects with ICSI 
only) in the two treatment groups were very similar. The highest count was observed for

regulation, the hCG for ovulation induction, and any luteal support were selected by the 
investigator. The numbers of patients enrolled in Follow-up Part B are 155 women.  
Interim analysis 
The Applicant has submitted an interim analysis of Follow-up Part B (data cut-off 4 July 2011). 
This interim analysis includes 77 patients (38 treated with Gonal-f in the Main study, 39 treated 
with Ovaleap). All of the 77 patients were treated in cycle 2 and 20 of these patients were 
treated in cycle 3. The demographic characteristics for the patients in Follow-up Part B were 
comparable between the groups treated with Gonal-f and Ovaleap in the Main Study. 
The total dose of r-hFSH in cycle 2 of Follow-up Part B was higher than in the Ovaleap group of 
the main study (interim results, mean 2004.1 vs. 1535.8 IU; final results, mean 1998.2 vs. 
1535.8 IU). The justification for this finding might be the treatment regimens: in the main study, 
patients received a fixed daily dose of 150 IU r-hFSH for the first 5 days followed by dose 
adaptation, whereas in Follow-up Part B all doses of Ovaleap were selected by the investigator. 
Results for Follow-up Part B are in line with published values for the amount of Gonal-f needed 
for optimal follicular development in other clinical trials: 2775 IU (European and Israeli Study 
Group 2002), 2070 IU (Frydman 2000), 1695 IU (Schats 2000), and 2385 IU (Andersen 2006).  
Pregnancy follow-up 
Clinical pregnancies resulting from embryo transfers in the treatment cycle of the main study 
(from at least 5 to 7 weeks after oocyte retrieval) and documented by ultrasound were to be 
monitored until birth to measure the take-home baby rate and document complications during 
pregnancy, delivery, as well as the neonatal outcome including congenital malformations. In 
total, 99 patients gave birth to 111 live babies. Complications during pregnancy were reported in 
7 patients from the Gonal-f group and 5 patients from the XM17 group: clinical abortion in 1 vs. 
2 patients, missed abortion in 3 vs. 3 patients, and other complications in 3 vs. 1 patients. The 
other complications in the 3 Gonal-f patients were induced abortion due to chromosomal 
aberration, epilepsia paroxysm, and premature delivery (triplets). In the XM17 patient with 
clinical abortion Down’s syndrome was reported as a complication. A total of 10 patients 
therefore had abortions (5 in each treatment group).

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
One pivotal Phase III study (XM17-05) was conducted in 299 patients to document the efficacy 
of Ovaleap compared to Gonal-f in the stimulation of multifollicular development in patients 
undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART), which is acceptable, as 
it is in accordance with the ‘Draft guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar 
biological medicinal products containing recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-FSH, 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010)’. The design of the study was adequate. Gonal-f is appropriate 
as the reference product. The applied inclusion and exclusion criteria are adequate and in line 
with other ART studies. 
A double-blind design was not technically feasible for this study, as Ovaleap is provided in 
cartridges that have to be inserted into a special pen (medical device), while Gonal-f is provided 
as a solution for injection in a pre-filled pen that already contains the cartridge with the 
medication. Although a double-blind design would have been preferred, in view of the hard 
primary efficacy endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ an assessor-blind design is considered 
acceptable. 
The primary endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ is in accordance with the draft guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010. This endpoint is an adequate endpoint, as it is strongly 
influenced by the effect of FSH on the ovaries, and at the same time represents an endpoint of 
clinical relevance. 
Regarding the statistical methods, the equivalence margin for the primary end point ‘number of 
oocytes retrieved’ was -3 and +3 oocytes and is adequately justified. The sample size has a 90% 
power for rejecting the null hypothesis that Ovaleap is different to Gonal-f with an equivalence 
margin of -3, +3, which is appropriate. The ZIP regression analysis for the primary endpoint 
takes overstimulation as well as understimulation into account, as is recommended by the draft 
guideline EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010.  
The fixed dose of 150 IU recFSH used for the first five Stimulation Days is the lowest advised 
starting dose as indicated in the SmPC of Gonal-f (i.e. 150 to 225 IU). Dose adjustment was 
made possible from Stimulation Day 6 onwards, which is in line with common practice in Europe. 
No clinically relevant differences were observed in the baseline characteristics.

The primary endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ was similar in both treatment groups: 12.2 
in the Ovaleap group compared to 12.0 in the Gonal-f group. Equivalence was shown for the 
primary endpoint (0.03, 95% CI -0.76, +0.82), the 95% confidence intervals were well within 
the equivalence margin (-3, +3). The four exploratory analyses were in support of the main ZIP 
regression analysis.  
The secondary endpoints (total r-hFSH dose; number of days of r-hFSH stimulation; number of 
patients needing dose adaptations of r-hFSH and number of follicles (≤ 10 mm, > 10 to 14 mm, 
> 14 to 17 mm, > 17 mm) on Stimulation Day 6 prior to dose adaptation) are directly linked to 
the pharmacodynamic action of FSH. 
Small differences were noted in the mean total r-hFSH dose (1536 IU for Ovaleap vs. 1614 IU for 
Gonal-f), number of days of r-hFSH stimulation (9.3 days vs. 9.7 days, respectively) and number 
of patients needing dose increases (35.9% vs. 43.2%, respectively). A difference was also noted 
in the frequency of patients with follicles >14 mm before dose adaptation was allowed, which 
was 27% in the Ovaleap group vs. 14% in the Gonal-f group. Though at the end of treatment the 
frequency of patients with follicles > 14 mm was similar (93% vs. 94%), as well as the oestradiol 
levels (2744.3 pg/mL for Ovaleap vs. 2598.5 pg/mL for Gonal-f). 
All together, these data show a slightly higher potency of Ovaleap compared to Gonal-f though 
the noted differences in dose requirements are only considered small. The observed mean 
difference in total r-hFSH for a treatment period of about 9-10 days is 78 IU. Further, the 
average daily FSH dose was similar in both groups 165 IU/day for Ovaleap vs. 166 IU/day for 
Gonal-f. 
The ongoing pregnancy rate per randomized patient (33.6% for Gonal-f and 27.5% for Ovaleap) 
was comparable and supportive of the primary endpoint. The overall clinical pregnancy rate for 
patients with embryo transfer is in line with results for Gonal-f shown in clinical trials using a 
GnRH agonist for down-regulation as reported in literature, varying from 23% to 39%. There 
were no clinically relevant differences in the pregnancy follow-up. 
The take-home baby rate per embryo transfer was in line with the ongoing pregnancy rate per 
randomized patient (35.1% for Gonal-f and 29.1% for Ovaleap). The other secondary efficacy 
measures were also supportive of the primary endpoint. Therefore, the therapeutic equivalence 
for the primary efficacy endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ has been established for Ovaleap 
and the reference product Gonal-f.   
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Therapeutic equivalence for the primary efficacy endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ has been 
established for Ovaleap and the reference product Gonal-f. Further, no major differences were 
identified in dose requirements between Ovaleap and Gonal-f. The demonstration of efficacy of 
Ovaleap for stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for 
ART allows extrapolation to other therapeutic indications approved for Gonal-f.

Patient exposure 
In total, 296 subjects received at least 1 dose of Ovaleap. A total of 76 healthy subjects were 
treated with a single dose in the Phase I trials (XM17-01 and XM17-02). In the Phase III trial 
XM17-05 (Main Study), 153 patients were randomised to Ovaleap. A further 67 patients who 
were randomised to Gonal-f were treated with open-label Ovaleap during Follow-up Part B. 
Within the active-controlled Phase III trial no clear differences were observed in the subjects’ 
demographic and infertility characteristics between the treatment groups.  
In  study  XM17-05,  most  of  the  XM17-treated  patients  (113,  51.4%)  received  XM17  as  follicle 
stimulating drug for a single cycle; 73 (33.2%) patients received XM17 for a total of 2 cycles and 
34 (15.4%) for 3 cycles.

The applicant provided information on treatment emergent-adverse events (TEAEs), resolved 
TEAEs, and serious TEAEs in XM17-05. The overall frequencies were very low and comparable 
across treatment groups; 22 TEAEs occurred in 22 (15.1%) patients for the Gonal-f group and 28 
TEAEs occurred in 25 (16.3%) patients in the XM17 group. The Applicant indicated that these low 
frequencies were expected in the study population of healthy women with a mean age of about 
31 years. 
Frequencies of TEAEs according to SOCs were all below 5% in both treatment groups. The most 
commonly  affected  SOCs  were  pregnancy,  puerperium,  and  perinatal  conditions  (4.3%,  13 
patients),  reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders  (4.3%,  13  patients),  and  gastrointestinal 
disorders  (3.3%,  10  patients).  Frequencies  were  similar  between  treatment  groups  except  for 
gastrointestinal disorders that were more common in the XM17 group than in the Gonal-f group: 
4.6% (7 patients) vs. 2.1% (3 patients) (see table below). 
Table 16: Most frequent TEAEs reported by 2 or more patients in XM17-05 (Main Study, 
SP) 
OHSS was the most common event (11, 3.7% patients) and is a known undesirable effect of FSH 
treatment. It was more common in the XM17 group than in the Gonal-f group: 7 (4.6%) vs. 4 
(2.7%). Abdominal pain was also more common in the XM17 group than in the Gonal-f group: 5 
(3.3%) vs. 1 (0.7%) patients; none of the patients with the abdominal pain experienced OHSS.  
Three ectopic pregnancies occurred in patients during the main study: 1 (0.7%) in the Gonal-f 
group and 2 (1.3%) in the XM17 group. Abortions were reported as TEAEs in 7 patients during 
the Main Study: 4 (2.7%) in the Gonal-f group and 3 (2.0%) in the XM17 group. There were no 
embolic or thrombotic events during the main study. 
Treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions 
Treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions (TEADRs) were reported in 16 (5.4%) patients, with 
a lower frequency in the Gonal-f group than in the XM17 group: 5 (3.4%) vs. 11 (7.2%) 
patients. There were fewer TEADRs of OHSS, abdominal pain, and nausea in the Gonal-f group 
than in the XM-17 group. 
The overall incidence in subjects experiencing at least one AE was generally similar between the 
treatment groups, with 15.1% in Gonal-f group versus 16.3% in the Ovaleap group. These 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 57/72 
 
 
  
  
frequencies are considered extremely low. In comparison, in the Phase III trials in which r-hFSH 
Puregon was compared to the modified r-hFSH Elonva the frequencies of subjects experiencing at 
least one AE were 54.7% and 62.4% for both Phase III trials (source: EPAR Elonva). One of the 
main reasons that could have resulted in this lower frequency is that the observation period was 
about 4-8 weeks shorter compared to the ENSURE/ENGAGE studies of Elonva. Further, 
differences in reporting adverse events were observed between countries. The most commonly 
affected SOCs were pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions, reproductive system and 
breast disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. 
Treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions (TEADRs) were reported in 16 (5.4%) patients, with 
a lower frequency in the Gonal-f group than in the XM17 group: 5 (3.4%) vs. 11 (7.2%) 
patients,. There were fewer TEADRs of OHSS (4 vs. 7 patients), abdominal pain (1 vs. 4 
patients), and nausea (0 vs. 1 patient) in the Gonal-f group than in the XM-17 group. The 
number of TEADRs is, however, considered very small.  
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (bruising, burning, redness, skin irritation, swelling) were assessed as no 
reaction at all, mild, moderate, or severe. Frequencies were comparable between treatment 
groups and the majority of patients (> 80%) did not report any reactions. Overall frequencies of 
patients with mild reactions ranged from 1.0% to 3.4% for bruising, skin irritation, and swelling; 
7.4% for burning; and 11.4% for redness. Moderate skin reactions comprised bruising in 1 
patient (Gonal-f), burning in 2 patients (Gonal-f 1 patient, XM17 1 patient), and redness in 1 
patient (XM17). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in the completed or ongoing studies. 
Serious TEAEs were reported in 7 (4.8%) patients in the Gonal-f group and 9 (5.9%) patients in 
the Ovaleap group. The SAEs reported in both treatment groups were: OHSS (2 for Gonal-f and 3 
for Ovaleap) and ectopic pregnancy (1 for Gonal-f and 2 for Ovaleap). There were no clinically 
relevant differences between both treatment groups. For a discussion on OHSS, see AEs of 
special interest below. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pivotal phase III study XM17-05 only three patients (2 patients in Gonal-f group and 1 
patient in Ovaleap group) were discontinued due to an adverse event. All these events were 
related to OHSS. There were no clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups. 
AE of special interest – Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
OHSS represents one of the most serious complications in ART. The OHSS cases were classified 
in severity by the investigator (mild, moderate, severe). The number of cases was small, 4 cases 
(2.7%) in the Gonal-f group and 7 cases (4.6%) in the Ovaleap group, though appeared slightly 
higher in the Gonal-f group compared to the Ovaleap group. All of the events had resolved at the 
end of the study, except from one patient from whom it is unknown. The incidence reported in

the pivotal phase III study XM17-05 is in the same order as the incidence that is reported in the 
product information of Puregon (4%). 
Of the reported OHSS cases the intensity was considered severe by the investigator in 1 patient 
in each treatment group, and moderate for 1 patient in the Gonal-f group and 3 patients in the 
Ovaleap group. In contrast, the discontinuation due to OHSS was higher (2 patients) in the 
Gonal-f group compared to the Ovaleap group (1 patient).

intensity according to the investigator and according to the criteria of Papanikolaou and Navot is 
considered more important. 
It is agreed with the Applicant that the following parameters were comparable: 
- the total dose of r-hFSH (median 1500 and 1425 for Gonal-f and Ovaleap, respectively); 
- serum  oestradiol  levels  on  the  day  of  hCG  injection  (2598.5  pg/mL  for  Gonal-f  and  2744.3 
pg/mL for Ovaleap); 
- hCG dose (A full syringe was administered in 137 Gonal-f (93.8%) vs. 148 Ovaleap (96.7%) 
patients and half a syringe in 5 (3.4%) vs. 4 (2.6%) patients); 
- body weight (63.1 in the Gonal-f group and 63.8 in the Ovaleap group); 
- age (31.7 in the Gonal-f group and 31.6 in the Ovaleap group). 
and cannot explain the difference that is observed in OHSS. The observed difference could 
therefore be a chance finding. 
Immunological events 
In the Quality section of the application file it is shown that the non-human sialic acid variety N-
glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) was more present in Ovaleap compared to Gonal-f. This sialic 
acid cannot be synthesized by humans, though trace amounts are detected from consumption of 
animals in human diet. The sources are mainly red meats such as lamb, pork and beef. Studies 
have reported the presence of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in all humans, up to 0.1–0.2% of 
circulating IgG. Ghaderi et al. (2010) speculated that circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in 
humans can potentially fix complement and cause untoward reactions in some patients and/or 
affect half-life. The authors state that circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could have relevant 
effects on clearance rate, and subsequently lead to lack of efficacy. Further, the authors indicate 
that pre-existing antibodies against a glycan on a glycoprotein can secondarily enhance antibody 
reactivity against the underlying protein backbone.  
Validation of the antibody assay 
In response to the various issues raised in the D120 LoQ on the validation of the antibody assay, 
the applicant has completely revised the ECL Bridging Immunogenicity Assay method used to 
determine anti-FSH antibodies (both in the screening and confirmatory assays) in human serum 
samples. The strategy to revise the assay and the (positive and negative) controls chosen can be 
agreed with. 
Immunogenicity testing in clinical trials 
The observed difference in Neu5Gc content between Ovaleap and Gonal-f was justified by the 
Applicant. The absolute quantity of Neu5Gc in Ovaleap is negligible compared to the dietary 
intake of this non-human sialic acid. Antibodies of IgA, IgG and IgM classes recognising Neu5Gc 
containing glyproteins are present in humans, but are predominantly directed at Neu5Gc-R 
motifs not present in CHO cell produced glycoproteins. Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies of IgE class have 
not been identified. 
Based on the provided clinical data by the Applicant for Ovaleap, it is reassuring that anti-
Neu5Gc antibodies apparently are not affecting Ovaleap in such an extent that PK or efficacy are

Page 60/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
significantly changed at a group level. However, these data do not reveal any potential effect at 
an individual level.  
In response the Applicant provided the validation report of the new revised ADA assay and the 
re-analysis results of the Phase III study XM17-05 clinical samples. Pre-existing Neu5Gc 
antibodies were found in 18% of the patients. This percentage is lower than in the publication of 
Tangvoranuntakul et al. (2003, PNAS). in which the authors found that circulating anti-Neu5Gc 
antibodies are present in most normal humans. It appears that the assay by the Applicant is less 
sensitive than the ELISA assay deployed by these authors. However, the low level pre-existing 
antibodies apparently that are missed by applicant’s assay and that are present in most of the 
population are unlikely to have an effect on Ovaleap’s efficacy given the clinical equivalence 
between Ovaleap and Gonal-f. 
Despite  this  apparent  lower  sensitivity  for  Neu5GC  antibodies  the  method  has  sufficiently  been 
validated  and  can  be  considered  adequate.  There  is  no  evidence  that  a  more  sensitive  assay 
would  change  the  conclusion  that  antibodies  against  Neu5GC  are  of  no  clinical  concern  for 
Ovaleap. 
Pre-existing antibodies 
•  Patients  with  pre-existing  anti-Neu5Gc  positive  findings  had  a  similar  biochemical  pregnancy 
rate  (16  out  of  27  patients,  59.3%)  compared  to  the  patients  without  pre-existing  anti-
Neu5Gc positive findings (155 out of 270 patients, 57.4%). 
•  Similarly,  patients  with  pre-existing  anti-Neu5Gc  positive  findings  had  a  similar  biochemical 
pregnancy  rate  (60.9%)  compared  to  the  patients  without  pre-existing  anti-Neu5Gc  positive 
findings (57.4%). 
•  When  looking  at  the  two  treatment  groups  the  biochemical  pregnancy  rates  in  the  patients 
with pre-existing Neu5Gc and FSH-antibodies were 50.0% for Gonal-f and 63.2% for Ovaleap, 
whereas  in  the  patients  with  only  pre-existing  Neu5Gc  antibodies the  biochemical  pregnancy 
rate  was  66.7%  for  Gonal-f  and  33.3%  for  Ovaleap.  The  biochemical  pregnancy  rate  in  the 
Ovaleap  group  with  only  pre-existing  Neu5Gc  antibodies  is  lower  (33.3%),  however,  only  6 
patients  were  included  in  this  subgroup,  and  this  pregnancy  rate  could  be  lower  due  to 
chance.  The  pregnancy  rate  in  the  Ovaleap  group  with  pre-existing  Neu5Gc  antibodies  and 
Ovaleap antibodies was 63.2%, which is reassuring. 
Based on these findings, it can be concluded that pre-existing Neu5Gc antibodies do not have an 
effect on the treatment with r-hFSH containing Neu5Gc. 
Patients with post-dose positive findings 
The biochemical pregnancy rate in the patients with at least one developed positive post-dose 
finding was 45.5% (10 out of 22 subjects), whereas it was 58.1% (161 out of 277 subjects) in 
patients without at least one developed positive post-dose finding. The biochemical pregnancy 
rate was only slightly lower (45.5%), and it has to be taken into account that the group was very 
small, i.e. 22 subjects. The immunological findings in both treatment groups are not of clinical 
concern. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/41467/2013 
Page 61/72 
 
 
 
 
  
  
In conclusion, the risk on an immune response is negligible. The immunogenicity of Ovaleap and 
Gonal-f can be considered similar. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant effects were observed between the treatment groups in the completed 
Phase III study on the clinical laboratory evaluation. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with Ovaleap. As Ovaleap is a biosimilar, 
it is acceptable that no formal drug interaction studies have been performed. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The submission of three studies, from which one efficacy/safety study for the biosimilar Ovaleap 
is sufficient in support of clinical safety, provided that Ovaleap fulfils all the requirements for a 
biosimilar.  
In total, 296 subjects received at least 1 dose of Ovaleap. The exposure is considered sufficient, 
provided that all requirements are fulfilled for a biosimilar. Within the active-controlled Phase III 
trial no clear differences were observed in the subjects’ demographic and infertility 
characteristics between the treatment groups. The overall incidence in subjects experiencing at 
least one AE was generally similar between the treatment groups.  
Treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions (TEADRs) were reported in a small number of 
subjects. There were fewer TEADRs in the Gonal-f group (5 subjects; 3.4%) compared to the 
Ovaleap group (11 subjects; 7.2%), although the number of TEADRs is considered small. 
There were no clinically relevant differences between both treatment groups in local tolerance, 
serious TEAEs, nor in discontinuations due to (S)AEs. The OHSS cases were classified in severity 
by the investigator (mild, moderate, severe). The number of cases were small, 4 cases (2.7%) in 
the Gonal-f group and 7 cases (4.6%) in the Ovaleap group, though appeared slightly higher in 
the Gonal-f group compared to the Ovaleap group. Of these cases the intensity was considered 
severe by the investigator in 1 patient in each treatment group, and moderate for 1 patient in 
the Gonal-f group and 3 patients in the Ovaleap group. In contrast, the discontinuation due to 
OHSS was higher (2 patients) in the Gonal-f group compared to the Ovaleap group (1 patient).  
Immunogenicity 
The higher content of Neu5Gc in Ovaleap and Gonal-f  was justified by the Applicant. The 
absolute quantity of Neu5Gc in Ovaleap is negligible compared to the dietary intake of this non-
human sialic acid. In response to the various issues raised in the D120 LoQ on the validation of 
the antibody assay, the applicant has completely revised the ADA assay used to determine anti-
FSH antibodies in human serum samples. The re-analysis of the samples of the Phase III study 
XM17-05 with the revised ADA assay confirmed that the risk on an immune response is negligible 
and that the immunogenicity of Ovaleap and Gonal-f can be considered similar.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the AE profile of Ovaleap is comparable with Gonal-f. 
The incidence of OHSS was low in the Phase III trial. A slightly lower incidence was observed for 
the Gonal-f group (4 cases; 2.7%) versus the Ovaleap group (7 cases; 4.6%). The 
discontinuation rate due to OHSS was, however, in favour of the Ovaleap group (1 case) vs. 
Gonal-f group (2 cases). The following parameters were comparable and could not explain the 
slightly higher incidence in the Ovaleap group: the total dose of r-hFSH, serum oestradiol levels 
on the day of hCG injection, hCG dose, body weight and age. The observed difference could 
therefore be a chance finding. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance

PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 2.2, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for follitropin alfa (OVALEAP) is acceptable. 
The PRAC advises that the following should be conditions of the Marketing Authorisation: 
Risk management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed 
subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
• 
• 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Receptor affinity studies showed comparable binding of Gonal-f and Ovaleap to the human FSH 
receptor. In a cell-based assay employing human FSH-receptor expressing CHO cells, both 
products showed comparable biological activity.  
One pivotal Phase III study (XM17-05) was conducted in 299 patients to document the efficacy 
of Ovaleap in the stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation 
for assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The study had an assessor-blind design. A double-
blind design was not technically feasible for this study, as Ovaleap is provided in cartridges that 
have to be inserted into a special pen (medical device), while Gonal-f is provided as a solution for 
injection in a pre-filled pen that already contains the cartridge with the medication. Although a 
double-blind design would have been preferred, in view of the hard primary efficacy endpoint 
‘number of oocytes retrieved’ an assessor-blind design is considered acceptable. Gonal-f is 
appropriate as the reference product.  
The dose of 150 IU r-hFSH was fixed for the first five Stimulation Days. This is the lowest advised 
starting dose as indicated in the SPC of Gonal-f (i.e. 150 to 225 IU). The fixed recFSH dose for 
the first 5 days of stimulation is in accordance with the draft guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010 and considered acceptable. Dose adjustment was made possible 
from Stimulation Day 6 onwards, which is in line with common practice in Europe. 
The results for the primary endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ were 12.2 in the Ovaleap 
group compared to 12.0 in the Gonal-f group. Equivalence was shown by a ZIP regression model 
that takes specifically data with excess zeroes into account. The 95% confidence intervals for the 
difference between Ovaleap and Gonal-f were well within the pre-defined equivalence margin 
that is adequately justified. The four exploratory analyses were in support of the main analysis 
with the ZIP regression model. 
The secondary endpoints that are considered the most relevant, as they are directly linked to the 
pharmacodynamics action of FSH, for this biosimilar application are:

Total r-hFSH dose: 1536 IU (range 750 to 3600 IU) for Ovaleap vs. 1614 (range 900 to 
3525 IU) for Gonal-f. 
Number of days of r-hFSH stimulation: 9.3 days for Ovaleap vs. 9.7 days for Gonal-f. 
Number of patients needing dose adaptations after the first fixed 5 days of stimulation: 
51.0% for Ovaleap vs. 58.2% for Gonal-f. This was due to a lower frequency of dose 
increases: 35.9% for Ovaleap vs. 43.2% for Gonal-f. The frequency in dose decreases was 
identical: 15.0% for Ovaleap vs. 15.1% for Gonal-f. 
Number of follicles (≤ 10 mm, > 10 to 14 mm, > 14 to 17 mm, > 17 mm) on Stimulation 
Day 6 prior to dose adaptation. The frequency of patients with follicles >14 mm before 
dose adaptation was allowed was 27% in the Ovaleap group vs. 14% in the Gonal-f group, 
though at the end of treatment the frequency of patients with follicles > 14 mm was 
similar (93% vs. 94%). 
Estradiol levels after the first fixed 5 days of stimulation were: 479.6 pg/mL for Ovaleap 
(range 37.0 – 3213.0) vs. 350.3 pg/mL for Gonal-f (range 32.3 – 2153.0). This difference 
was less apparent at the end of the treatment period on the day of hCG administration 
(2242.5 pg/mL for Ovaleap vs. 2176.5 pg/mL for Gonal-f). 
The ongoing pregnancy rate was 33.6% (49/146) for Gonal-f and 27.5% (42/153) for 
Ovaleap. 
Regarding pharmacokinetics, study XM17-02 showed that the Ovaleap vs. Gonal-f ratios for the 
primary parameters Cmax and AUC0-t were within the 0.8-1.25 acceptance interval (0.958-
1.080 and 0.931-1.134, respectively). Additionally, both products had sufficient similar clearance 
and t1/2 values. Provided that on chemical-pharmaceutical grounds the product is acceptable as 
biosimilar, it is sufficiently shown that the product is bioequivalent with the innovator product 
Gonal-f. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The overall incidence in the Phase III study in subjects experiencing at least one AE was 15.1% 
in the Gonal-f group versus 16.3% in the Ovaleap group. The most commonly affected SOCs 
were pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions, reproductive system and breast 
disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. 
Treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions (TEADRs) were reported in 5 (3.4%) patients in the 
Gonal-f group compared to 11 (7.2%) patients in the Ovaleap group. There were fewer TEADRs 
of OHSS (4 vs 7 patients), abdominal pain (1 vs 4 patients), and nausea (0 vs 1 patient) in the 
Gonal-f group than in the Ovaleap group. Injection site reactions (bruising, burning, redness, 
skin irritation, swelling) were assessed as no reaction at all, mild, moderate, or severe. 
Frequencies were comparable between treatment groups and the majority of patients (> 80%) 
did not report any reactions. 
No deaths were reported. Serious TEAEs were reported in 7 (4.8%) patients in the Gonal-f group 
and 9 (5.9%) in the Ovaleap group. The SAEs reported in both treatment groups were: ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; 2 for Gonal-f vs. 3 for Ovaleap) and ectopic pregnancy (1 for 
Gonal-f vs. 2 for Ovaleap). Other serious TEAEs that were reported in one of the treatment 
Assessment report

Page 68/72 
 
 
 
 
  
  
groups were: abortion (missed, early, incomplete, spontaneous complete), (lower) abdominal 
pain and antepartum haemorrhage. 
The number of OHSS cases was low: 4 (2.7%) in the Gonal-f group and 7 cases (4.6%) in the 
Ovaleap group with discontinuation in 2 vs. 1 case, respectively. The lower frequency of OHSS in 
the Gonal-f group compared to the Ovaleap group (2.7% vs. 4.6%) was not statistically 
significant (p = 0.542).  All cases had resolved (except for one patient from whom it is 
unknown). Three patients were discontinued due to an adverse event in the Phase III trial (2 
Gonal-f, 1 Ovaleap). All these events were related to OHSS.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As Ovaleap was developed as a biosimilar the safety data is limited. In the Phase III study about 
150 patients were treated for the ART indication. The overall incidence in subjects experiencing 
at least one AE was comparable, but is considered relatively low with 15.1% in Gonal-f group 
versus 16.3% in the Ovaleap group. In comparison, in the Phase III trials in which r-hFSH 
Puregon was compared to the modified r-hFSH Elonva the frequencies of subjects experiencing at 
least one AE were 54.7% and 62.4% for both Phase III trials (source: EPAR Elonva). One of the 
main reasons that could have resulted in this lower frequency is that the observation period was 
about 4-8 weeks shorter compared to the ENSURE/ENGAGE studies of Elonva. Further, 
differences in reporting adverse events were observed between countries in the Ovaleap Phase 
III trial. 
The non-human sialic acid variety N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is more present in 
Ovaleap compared to Gonal-f. This Neu5Gc cannot be synthesized by humans, though trace 
amounts are detected from consumption of animals in human diet. The observed difference in 
Neu5Gc content between Ovaleap and Gonal-f was justified by the Applicant. The absolute 
quantity of Neu5Gc in Ovaleap is negligible compared to the dietary intake of this non-human 
sialic acid. Antibodies of IgA, IgG and IgM classes recognising Neu5Gc containing glyproteins are 
present in humans, but are predominantly directed at Neu5Gc-R motifs not present in CHO cell 
produced glycoproteins. Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies of IgE class have not been identified. 
In response to questions of the CHMP, the applicant has completely revised the ECL Bridging 
Immunogenicity Assay method used to determine anti-FSH antibodies in human serum samples. 
The strategy to revise the assay and the (positive and negative) controls have been chosen and 
the CHMP agreed with it. 
Based on the provided clinical data by the Applicant for Ovaleap, it is reassuring that anti-
Neu5Gc antibodies apparently are not affecting Ovaleap in such an extent that PK or efficacy are 
significantly changed at a group level. However, these data do not reveal any potential effect at 
an individual level. To rule out the presence of antibodies in all patients, the validation report of 
the new revised ADA assay and the re-analysis results of the Phase III study XM17-05 clinical 
samples should be presented to the agency pre-license. In response, the Applicant provided the 
validation report of the new revised ADA assay and the re-analysis results of the Phase III study 
XM17-05 clinical samples. The re-analysis of the samples of the Phase III study XM17-05 with 
the revised ADA assay confirmed that the risk on an immune response is negligible and that the 
immunogenicity of Ovaleap and Gonal-f can be considered similar. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Neu5GC content 
A difference is observed in the non-human sialic acid Neu5Gc in the Quality part of the dossier. 
In contrast to Gonal-f, Ovaleap contains a higher amount of total sialic acid. FSH synthesised in 
the human body does not contain Neu5Gc due to the absence of a specific sialotransferase in

humans.  The Applicant has provided an adequate discussion and justification for this difference 
in Neu5GC content from a quality, pre-clinical and clinical perspective. 
The re-analysis of the samples of the Phase III study XM17-05 with the revised ADA assay  
confirmed that the risk on an immune response is negligible and that the immunogenicity of 
Ovaleap and Gonal-f can be considered similar. 
Efficacy 
In the one pivotal Phase III trial, Ovaleap was shown to be equivalent for the primary endpoint 
‘number of oocytes retrieved’. Several secondary endpoints were taken into account that 
investigated dose adjustments and possible differences between the dosages of Ovaleap and the 
reference product Gonal-f. The clinical data of the Phase III trial including the results after the 
fixed dose period at Day 6 are in accordance with the concept of biosimilarity. The observed dose 
differences in the pivotal Phase III study are only small. The total Ovaleap dose was only 4.8% 
lower than the total Gonal-f dose. This difference is not clinically relevant, and consequently the 
data of the pivotal Phase III study can be extrapolated to all other indications, including the 
indication ‘hypogonadotropic hypogonadism’. 
The major objection on the potentially increased immunogenicity risk as a consequence of the 
presence of a higher content of non-human sialic acid Neu5Gc is resolved. Ovaleap is considered 
a biosimilar of Gonal-f based on the provided quality, non-clinical and clinical data. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The issue on the potentially increased immunogenicity risk as a consequence of the presence of a 
higher content of non-human sialic acid Neu5Gc is resolved. Ovaleap is considered a biosimilar of 
Gonal-f based on the provided quality, non-clinical and clinical data. 
The re-analysis of the samples of the Phase III study XM17-05 with the revised ADA assay 
confirmed that the risk on an immune response is negligible and that the immunogenicity of 
Ovaleap and Gonal-f can be considered similar. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Ovaleap in the following indications: 
In adult women 
• 
• 
Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been 
unresponsive to treatment with clomifene citrate. 
Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for 
assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-
fallopian transfer and zygote intra fallopian transfer.

• 
Ovaleap in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the 
stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In 
clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/l. 
In adult men 
• 
Ovaleap is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or 
acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) therapy.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nusinersen, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
As of 19 October 2018, 100 AEs of hypersensitivity due to the administration of nusinersen were identified 
from the clinical trial database. Ninety-eight of these were considered not or unlikely related to 
nusinersen. The remaining 2 events (rash and eosinophil count increased, both nonserious) were possibly 
related to nusinersen. A cumulative search of postmarketing data identified 37 possible hypersensitivity 
events; 20 medically confirmed. Time to onset was reported in 11 of these 20, and ranged from directly 
following the injection to 1 week after the injection. Two events, angioedema and serum sickness, were 
considered serious and related. There were no reports of a patient discontinuing treatment due to these 
events. Taken together, there is sufficient evidence to support a causal association between nusinersen 
administration and hypersensitivity; and the PI should be updated accordingly.  Prevention and treatment 
will be managed by routine clinical practice and no additional risk minimization measures or evaluations 
are required as part of the pharmacovigilance plan. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nusinersen the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nusinersen is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

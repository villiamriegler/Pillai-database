CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Gardasil 9 is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 9 years against the
following HPV diseases:
• 
Premalignant lesions and cancers affecting the cervix, vulva, vagina and anus caused by vaccine
HPV types.
• 
Genital warts (Condyloma acuminata) caused by specific HPV types.
See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support these indications.
The use of Gardasil 9 should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
Individuals 9 to and including 14 years of age at time of first injection
Gardasil 9 can be administered according to a 2-dose (0, 6 – 12 months) schedule (see section 5.1).
The second dose should be administered between 5 and 13 months after the first dose. If the second
2
vaccine dose is administered earlier than 5 months after the first dose, a third dose should always be
administered. 
Gardasil 9 can be administered according to a 3-dose (0, 2, 6 months) schedule. The second dose
should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose should be
administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within a 1-year
period.
Individuals 15 years of age and older at time of first injection
Gardasil 9 should be administered according to a 3-dose (0, 2, 6 months) schedule.
The second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose
should be administered at least 3 months after the second dose. All three doses should be given within
a 1-year period.
The use of Gardasil 9 should be in accordance with official recommendations.
It is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil 9 complete the vaccination
course with Gardasil 9 (see section 4.4).
The need for a booster dose has not been established.
Studies using a mixed regimen (interchangeability) of HPV vaccines were not performed for
Gardasil 9.
Subjects previously vaccinated with a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18
vaccine (Gardasil), hereafter referred to as qHPV vaccine, may receive 3 doses of Gardasil 9 (see
section 5.1). qHPV vaccine was also known as Silgard in some countries.
Paediatric population (children <9 years of age)
The safety and efficacy of Gardasil 9 in children below 9 years of age have not been established. No
data are available (see section 5.1).
Method of administration
The vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred site is the deltoid area of
the upper arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.
Gardasil 9 must not be injected intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should
not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines and solution. 
For instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Individuals with hypersensitivity after previous administration of Gardasil 9 or Gardasil/Silgard
should not receive Gardasil 9.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

The decision to vaccinate an individual should take into account the risk for previous HPV exposure
and potential benefit from vaccination.
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be
readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.
Syncope (fainting), sometimes associated with falling, can occur following, or even before, any
vaccination, especially in adolescents as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be
accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia, and
tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. Therefore, vaccinees should be observed for
approximately 15 minutes after vaccination. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury
from fainting.
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness.
However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a mild upper respiratory tract infection or low-
grade fever, is not a contraindication for immunisation.
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Gardasil 9 may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.
The vaccine will only protect against diseases that are caused by HPV types targeted by the vaccine
(see section 5.1). Therefore, appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted diseases should
continue to be used.
The vaccine is for prophylactic use only and has no effect on active HPV infections or established
clinical disease. The vaccine has not been shown to have a therapeutic effect. The vaccine is therefore
not indicated for treatment of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancer, high-grade cervical, vulvar,
vaginal and anal dysplastic lesions or genital warts. It is also not intended to prevent progression of
other established HPV-related lesions.
Gardasil 9 does not prevent lesions due to a vaccine HPV type in individuals infected with that HPV
type at the time of vaccination.
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. Since no vaccine is 100 % effective and
Gardasil 9 will not provide protection against every HPV type, or against HPV infections present at
the time of vaccination, routine cervical screening remains critically important and should follow local
recommendations.
There are no data on the use of Gardasil 9 in individuals with impaired immune responsiveness. Safety
and immunogenicity of a qHPV vaccine have been assessed in individuals aged 7 to 12 years who are
known to be infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (see section 5.1).
Individuals with impaired immune responsiveness, due to either the use of potent immunosuppressive
therapy, a genetic defect, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, or other causes, may not
respond to the vaccine.
This vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation
disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.
Long-term follow-up studies are currently ongoing to determine the duration of protection (see
section 5.1).
There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Gardasil 9 with
bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccines.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Safety and immunogenicity in individuals who have received immunoglobulin or blood-derived
products during the 3 months prior to vaccination have not been studied in clinical trials.
Use with other vaccines
Gardasil 9 may be administered concomitantly with a combined booster vaccine containing
diphtheria (d) and tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis
[inactivated] (IPV) (dTap, dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) with no significant interference with antibody
response to any of the components of either vaccine. This is based on the results from a clinical trial in
which a combined dTap-IPV vaccine was administered concomitantly with the first dose of Gardasil 9
(see section 4.8).
Use with hormonal contraceptives
In clinical studies, 60.2 % of women aged 16 to 26 years who received Gardasil 9 used hormonal
contraceptives during the vaccination period of the clinical studies. Use of hormonal contraceptives
did not appear to affect the type-specific immune responses to Gardasil 9.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
Post-marketing data on pregnant women indicates no malformative nor foeto/neonatal toxicity of
Gardasil 9 when administered during pregnancy.
Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
A six-year pregnancy registry for Gardasil 9 prospectively followed 180 women of which there were
69 pregnancies with known outcomes. Frequencies of miscarriage and major birth defects were 4.3 %
of pregnancies (3/69) and 4.5 % of live born infants (3/67), respectively. These frequencies were
consistent with estimated background frequencies. These data support similar findings from a
five-year pregnancy registry for qHPV vaccine in which 1,640 pregnancies with known outcomes
were included.
However, these data are considered insufficient to recommend use of Gardasil 9 during pregnancy.
Vaccination should be postponed until completion of pregnancy (see section 5.1).
Breast-feeding
Gardasil 9 can be used during breast-feeding.
A total of 92 women were breast-feeding during the vaccination period of the clinical studies of
Gardasil 9 in women aged 16 to 26 years. In the studies, vaccine immunogenicity was comparable
between breast-feeding women and women who did not breast-feed. In addition, the adverse
experience profile for breast-feeding women was comparable to that of the women in the overall
safety population. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse experiences reported in infants who
were breast-feeding during the vaccination period.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of Gardasil 9 on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate
harmful effects on fertility (see section 5.3).
5
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Gardasil 9 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, some of the
effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” may temporarily affect the ability to drive
or use machines.
4.8  Undesirable effects
A. Summary of the safety profile
In 7 clinical trials, individuals were administered Gardasil 9 on the day of enrolment and
approximately 2 and 6 months thereafter. Safety was evaluated using vaccination report card
(VRC)-aided surveillance for 14 days after each injection of Gardasil 9. A total of 15,776 individuals
(10,495 subjects aged 16 to 26 years and 5,281 adolescents aged 9 to 15 years at enrolment) received
Gardasil 9. Few individuals (0.1 %) discontinued due to adverse experiences. 
In one of these clinical trials which enrolled 1,053 healthy adolescents aged 11 to 15 years,
administration of the first dose of Gardasil 9 concomitantly with a combined diphtheria, tetanus,
pertussis [acellular, component] and poliomyelitis [inactivated] booster vaccine showed that more
injection-site reactions (swelling, erythema), headache and pyrexia were reported. The differences
observed were < 10 % and in the majority of subjects, the adverse events were reported as mild to
moderate in intensity (see section 4.5).
In a clinical trial that included 640 individuals aged 27 to 45 years and 570 individuals aged 16 to
26 years who received Gardasil 9, the safety profile of Gardasil 9 was comparable between the two
age groups.
The most common adverse reactions observed with Gardasil 9 were injection-site adverse reactions
(84.8 % of vaccinees within 5 days following any vaccination visit) and headache (13.2 % of the
vaccinees within 15 days following any vaccination visit). These adverse reactions usually were mild
or moderate in intensity.

qHPV vaccine
Table 2 includes adverse experiences that have been spontaneously reported during post-approval use
of qHPV vaccine. The post-marketing safety experience with qHPV vaccine is relevant to Gardasil 9
since the vaccines contain L1 HPV proteins of 4 of the same HPV types.
Because these events were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to
reliably estimate their frequency or to establish, for all events, a causal relationship to vaccine
exposure.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Papillomavirus vaccines, ATC code: J07BM03
Mechanism of action
Gardasil 9 is an adjuvanted non-infectious recombinant 9-valent vaccine. It is prepared from the
highly purified virus-like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid L1 protein from the same four HPV
types (6, 11, 16, 18) in qHPV vaccine and from 5 additional HPV types (31, 33, 45, 52, 58). It uses the
same amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate adjuvant as qHPV vaccine. The VLPs cannot
infect cells, reproduce or cause disease. The efficacy of L1 VLP vaccines is thought to be mediated by
the development of a humoral immune response. The genotypes for the vaccine comprised of HPV
types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 will be referred to as vaccine HPV types.
Based on epidemiology studies, Gardasil 9 is anticipated to protect against the HPV types that cause
approximately: 90 % of cervical cancers, more than 95 % of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), 75-85 % of
high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3), 85-90 % of HPV related vulvar cancers,
90-95 % of HPV related high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/3), 80-85 % of HPV
related vaginal cancers, 75-85 % of HPV related high-grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN
2/3), 90-95 % of HPV related anal cancer, 85-90 % of HPV related high-grade anal intraepithelial
neoplasia (AIN 2/3), and 90 % of genital warts.
The indication of Gardasil 9 is based on:
• 
demonstration of efficacy of qHPV vaccine to prevent persistent infection and disease related to
HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 in females aged 16 to 45 years and males aged 16 to 26 years.
• 
• 
• 
demonstration of non-inferior immunogenicity between Gardasil 9 and the qHPV vaccine for
HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 in girls aged 9 to 15 years, women and men aged 16 to 26 years;
efficacy for Gardasil 9 against persistent infection and disease related to HPV types 6, 11, 16, or
18 can be inferred to be comparable to that of the qHPV vaccine.
demonstration of efficacy against persistent infection and disease related to HPV types 31, 33,
45, 52 and 58 in girls and women aged 16 to 26 years, and 
demonstration of non-inferior immunogenicity against the Gardasil 9 HPV types in boys and
girls aged 9 to 15 years, men aged 16 to 26 years and women aged 27 to 45 years, compared to
girls and women aged 16 to 26 years.
Clinical studies for Gardasil 9
Efficacy and/or immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 were assessed in ten clinical studies. Clinical studies
evaluating the efficacy of Gardasil 9 against placebo were not acceptable because HPV vaccination is
recommended and implemented in many countries for protection against HPV infection and disease.
Therefore, the pivotal clinical study (Protocol 001) evaluated the efficacy of Gardasil 9 using qHPV
vaccine as a comparator.
8
Efficacy against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 was primarily assessed using a bridging strategy that
demonstrated comparable immunogenicity (as measured by Geometric Mean Titres [GMT]) of
Gardasil 9 compared with qHPV vaccine (Protocol 001, GDS01C/Protocol 009 and GDS07C/Protocol
020).
In the pivotal study Protocol 001, the efficacy of Gardasil 9 against HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58
was evaluated compared to qHPV vaccine in women aged 16 to 26 years (N=14,204: 7,099 receiving
Gardasil 9; 7,105 receiving qHPV vaccine).
Protocol 002 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in girls and boys aged 9 to 15 years and women
aged 16 to 26 years (N=3,066: 1,932 girls; 666 boys; and 468 women receiving Gardasil 9). 
Protocol 003 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in men aged 16 to 26 years and women aged 16
to 26 years (N=2,515:1,103 Heterosexual Men [HM]; 313 Men Who Have Sex with Men [MSM]; and
1,099 women receiving Gardasil 9).
Protocol 004 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in women aged 16 to 45 years (N=1,210: 640
women aged 27 to 45 years and 570 women aged 16 to 26 years). 
Protocols 005 and 007 evaluated Gardasil 9 concomitantly administered with vaccines recommended
routinely in girls and boys aged 11 to 15 years (N=2,295). 
Protocol 006 evaluated administration of Gardasil 9 to girls and women aged 12 to 26 years previously
vaccinated with qHPV vaccine (N=921; 615 receiving Gardasil 9 and 306 receiving placebo). 
GDS01C/Protocol 009 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in girls aged 9 to 15 years (N=600;
300 receiving Gardasil 9 and 300 receiving qHPV vaccine). 
GDS07C/Protocol 020 evaluated immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in men aged 16 to 26 years (N=500;
249 receiving Gardasil 9 and 251 receiving qHPV vaccine).
Protocol 010 evaluated the immunogenicity of 2 doses of Gardasil 9 in girls and boys aged 9 to
14 years and 3 doses of Gardasil 9 in girls aged 9 to 14 years and women aged 16 to 26 years
(N=1,518; 753 girls; 451 boys and 314 women).
Studies supporting the efficacy of Gardasil 9 against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18
Efficacy of qHPV vaccine against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18
The efficacy and long-term effectiveness of qHPV vaccine against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related
disease endpoints have been demonstrated in clinical studies in the PPE (Per Protocol Efficacy)
population. The PPE population consisted of individuals who received all 3 vaccinations with qHPV
vaccine in the base study within 1 year of enrolment without major deviations from the study protocol,
were seronegative to the relevant HPV type(s) (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) prior to dose 1, and among
subjects 16 years and older at enrolment in the base study, PCR negative to the relevant HPV type(s)
prior to dose 1 through one month postdose 3 (Month 7).
In 16- through 26- year-old women (N=20,541) efficacy against HPV 16- and 18-related CIN2/3, AIS
or cervical cancer was 98.2 % (95 % CI: 93.5, 99.8) based on follow-up to 4 years (median 3.6 years);
efficacy against HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18-related diseases was 96.0 % (95 % CI: 92.3, 98.2) for CIN or
AIS, 100 % (95 % CI: 67.2, 100) for VIN2/3, 100 % (95 % CI: 55.4, 100) for VaIN2/3, and 99.0 %
(95 % CI: 96.2, 99.9) for genital warts.
9
In 24- through 45- year-old women (N=3,817) efficacy against HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18-related persistent
infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal lesions, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancers was
88.7 % (95 %CI: 78.1, 94.8).
In 16- through 26- year-old men (N=4,055) efficacy against HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18-related diseases was
74.9 % (95 % CI: 8.8, 95.4) for AIN 2/3 (median duration of follow-up of 2.15 years), 100.0 % (95 %
CI: -52.1, 100) for penile/perineal/perianal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) 1/2/3, and 89.3 % (95 % CI:
65.3, 97.9) for genital warts (median duration of follow-up of 4 years). 
In the long-term extension registry study for 16-23 year old women (n = 2,121), no cases of high grade
CIN were observed up to approximately 14 years. In this study, a durable protection was statistically
demonstrated to approximately 12 years. 
In long-term extensions of clinical studies, no cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and no
cases of genital warts were observed:
- 
- 
through 10.7 years in girls (n=369) and 10.6 years in boys (n = 326), 9-15 years of age at
time of vaccination (median follow-up of 10.0 years and 9.9 years, respectively); 
through 11.5 years in men (n=917), 16-26 years of age at time of vaccination (median
follow-up of 9.5 years); and through 10.1 years in women (n = 685), 24-45 years of age at
time of vaccination (median follow-up of 8.7 years).
Immunogenicity bridging from qHPV Vaccine to Gardasil 9 for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18
Comparison of Gardasil 9 with qHPV vaccine with respect to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were
conducted in a population of women aged 16 to 26 years from Protocol 001, girls aged 9 to 15 years
from GDS01C/Protocol 009 and men aged 16 to 26 years from GDS07C/Protocol 020.
A statistical analysis of non-inferiority was performed at Month 7 comparing cLIA anti-HPV 6,
anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 GMTs between individuals administered Gardasil 9 and
individuals administered Gardasil. Immune responses, measured by GMT, for Gardasil 9 were
non-inferior to immune responses for Gardasil (Table 3). In clinical studies 98.2 % to 100 % who
received Gardasil 9 became seropositive for antibodies against all 9 vaccine types by Month 7 across
all groups tested. In Protocol 001, GMTs for HPV-6, -11, -16 and -18 were comparable in subjects
who received qHPV vaccine or Gardasil 9 for at least 3.5 years.

Studies supporting the efficacy of Gardasil 9 against HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58
The efficacy of Gardasil 9 in women aged 16 to 26 years was assessed in an active
comparator-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical study (Protocol 001) that included a total of
14,204 women (Gardasil 9 = 7,099; qHPV vaccine = 7,105). Subjects were followed up to 67 months
postdose 3 with a median duration of 43 months postdose 3.
Gardasil 9 was efficacious in preventing HPV 31-, 33-, 45-, 52-, and 58-related persistent infection
and disease (Table 4). Gardasil 9 also reduced the incidence of HPV 31-, 33-, 45-, 52-, and 58-related
Pap test abnormalities, cervical and external genital procedures (i.e., biopsies), and cervical definitive
therapy procedures (Table 4).

Additional efficacy evaluation of Gardasil 9 against vaccine HPV types
Since the efficacy of Gardasil 9 could not be evaluated against placebo, the following exploratory
analyses were conducted.
Efficacy evaluation of Gardasil 9 against cervical high grade diseases caused by vaccine HPV
types in the PPE
The efficacy of Gardasil 9 against CIN 2 and worse related to vaccine HPV types compared to qHPV
vaccine was 94.4 % (95 % CI 78.8, 99.0) with 2/5,952 versus 36/5,947 cases. The efficacy of
Gardasil 9 against CIN 3 related to vaccine HPV types compared to qHPV vaccine was 100 % (95 %
CI 46.3, 100.0) with 0/5,952 versus 8/5,947 cases.
Impact of Gardasil 9 against cervical biopsy and definite therapy related to vaccine HPV types
in the PPE
The efficacy of Gardasil 9 against cervical biopsy related to vaccine HPV types compared to qHPV
vaccine was 95.9 % (95 % CI 92.7, 97.9) with 11/6,016 versus 262/6,018 cases. The efficacy of
Gardasil 9 against cervical definitive therapy (including loop electrosurgical excision procedure
[LEEP] or conisation) related to vaccine HPV types compared to qHPV vaccine was 90.7 % (95 % CI
76.3, 97.0) with 4/6,016 versus 43/6,018 cases.
Long-term effectiveness studies
A subset of subjects is being followed up for 10 to 14 years after Gardasil 9 vaccination for safety,
immunogenicity, and effectiveness against clinical diseases related to the HPV types in the vaccine.
In the long-term extensions of clinical studies Protocols 001 and 002, effectiveness was observed in
the PPE population. The PPE population consisted of individuals:
-  who received all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment, without major deviations from the
study protocol,
-  who were seronegative to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and among women
aged 16 to 26 years, PCR negative to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 through
one month postdose 3 (Month 7).
In Protocol 001 registry study, no cases of vaccine HPV types related high-grade CIN were observed
through 9.5 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 6.3 years) in women (n = 1,448) who were aged 16
to 26 years at time of vaccination with Gardasil 9.
In Protocol 002 extension study, no cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or genital warts were
observed through 11.0 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 10.0 years) in girls (n = 872) and
through 10.6 years postdose 3 (median follow-up of 9.9 years) in boys (n = 262) who were aged 9 to
15 years at time of vaccination with Gardasil 9. Incidence rates of vaccine HPV types related 6-month
persistent infections in girls and boys observed during the study were 52.4 and 54.6 per 10,000 person-
years, respectively, and within ranges of incidence rates expected in vaccinated cohorts of similar age
(based on results from previous efficacy studies of Gardasil 9 and qHPV vaccine).
Immunogenicity
The minimum anti-HPV titre that confers protective efficacy has not been determined.
Type-specific immunoassays with type-specific standards were used to assess immunogenicity to each
vaccine HPV type. These assays measured antibodies against neutralising epitopes for each HPV type.
The scales for these assays are unique to each HPV type; thus, comparisons across types and to other
assays are not appropriate.
Immune response to Gardasil 9 at Month 7
Immunogenicity was measured by (1) the percentage of individuals who were seropositive for
antibodies against the relevant vaccine HPV type, and (2) the Geometric Mean Titre (GMT).
13
Gardasil 9 induced robust anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, anti-HPV 18, anti-HPV 31,
anti-HPV 33, anti-HPV 45, anti-HPV 52, and anti-HPV 58 responses measured at Month 7, in
Protocols 001, 002, 004, 005, 007, and GDS01C/Protocol 009. In clinical studies 99.2 % to 100 %
who received Gardasil 9 became seropositive for antibodies against all 9 vaccine types by Month 7
across all groups tested. GMTs were higher in girls and boys than in women aged 16 to 26 years, and
higher in boys than in girls and women. As expected for women 27 to 45 years of age (Protocol 004),
the observed GMTs were lower than those seen in women aged 16 to 26 years.
Anti-HPV responses at Month 7 among girls/boys aged 9 to 15 years were comparable to anti-HPV
responses in women aged 16 to 26 years in the combined database of immunogenicity studies for
Gardasil 9.
On the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the efficacy of Gardasil 9 in girls and boys aged 9 to
15 years is inferred.
In Protocol 003, anti-HPV antibody GMTs at Month 7 among boys and men (HM) aged 16 to 26 years
were comparable to anti-HPV antibody GMTs among girls and women aged 16 to 26 years for vaccine
HPV types. High immunogenicity in MSM aged 16 to 26 years was also observed, although lower
than in HM, similarly to qHPV vaccine. In Protocol 020/GDS07C, anti-HPV antibody GMTs at
Month 7 among boys and men (HM) aged 16 to 26 years were comparable to anti-HPV antibody
GMTs among boys and men (HM) aged 16 to 26 years administered with the qHPV vaccine for HPV
6, 11, 16 and 18. These results support the efficacy of Gardasil 9 in the male population.
In Protocol 004, anti-HPV antibody GMTs at Month 7 among women aged 27 to 45 years were
non-inferior to anti-HPV antibody GMTs among girls and women aged 16 to 26 years for HPV 16, 18,
31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 with GMT ratios between 0.66 and 0.73. In a post hoc analysis for HPV 6 and
11, the GMT ratios were 0.81 and 0.76 respectively. These results support the efficacy of Gardasil 9 in
women aged 27 to 45 years.
Persistence of immune response to Gardasil 9
In long-term follow-up extension of clinical studies Protocols 001 and 002, persistence of antibody
responses was observed:
• 
for at least 5 years in women who were aged 16 to 26 years at time of vaccination with
Gardasil 9, depending on HPV type, 78 to100 % of subjects were seropositive; however,
efficacy was maintained in all subjects regardless of seropositivity status for any vaccine HPV
type through the end of the study (up to 67 months postdose 3, median follow-up duration of
43 months postdose 3),
• 
for at least 10 years in girls and boys who were aged 9 to 15 years at time of vaccination with
Gardasil 9; depending on HPV type, 81 to 98 % of subjects were seropositive.
Evidence of anamnestic (Immune Memory) response
Evidence of an anamnestic response was seen in vaccinated women who were seropositive to relevant
HPV type(s) prior to vaccination. In addition, women (n = 150) who received 3 doses of Gardasil 9 in
Protocol 001 and a challenge dose 5 years later, exhibited a rapid and strong anamnestic response that
exceeded the anti-HPV GMTs observed 1 month postdose 3. 
Administration of Gardasil 9 to individuals previously vaccinated with qHPV vaccine
Protocol 006 evaluated the immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 in 921 girls and women (aged 12 to
26 years) who had previously been vaccinated with qHPV vaccine. For subjects receiving Gardasil 9
after receiving 3 doses of qHPV vaccine, there was an interval of at least 12 months between
completion of vaccination with qHPV vaccine and the start of vaccination with Gardasil 9 with a
3-dose regimen (the time interval ranged from approximately 12 to 36 months).
14
Seropositivity to vaccine HPV types in the per protocol population ranged from 98.3 to 100 % by
Month 7 in individuals who received Gardasil 9. The GMTs to HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18 were higher
than in the population who had not previously received qHPV vaccine in other studies whereas the
GMTs to HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 were lower. The clinical significance of this observation is
not known.
Immunogenicity in HIV infected subjects
No clinical study of Gardasil 9 was conducted in HIV-infected individuals.
A study documenting safety and immunogenicity of qHPV vaccine has been performed in 126 HIV
infected subjects aged 7 to12 years with baseline CD4 % ≥15 and at least 3 months of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for subjects with a CD4 % <25 (of which 96 received qHPV vaccine).
Seroconversion to all four antigens occurred in more than 96 % of the subjects. The GMTs were
somewhat lower than reported in non-HIV infected subjects of the same age in other studies. The
clinical relevance of the lower response is unknown. The safety profile was similar to non-HIV
infected subjects in other studies. The CD4 % or plasma HIV RNA was not affected by vaccination.
Immune responses to Gardasil 9 using a 2-dose schedule in individuals 9 through 14 years of age
Protocol 010 measured HPV antibody responses to the 9 HPV types after Gardasil 9 vaccination in the
following cohorts: girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years receiving 2 doses at a 6-month or 12-month
interval (+/- 1-month); girls aged 9 to 14 years receiving 3 doses (at 0, 2, 6 months); and women aged
16 to 26 years receiving 3 doses (at 0, 2, 6 months).
One month following the last dose of the assigned regimen, between 97.9 % and 100 % of subjects
across all groups became seropositive for antibodies against the 9 vaccine HPV types. GMTs were
higher in girls and boys who received 2 doses of Gardasil 9 (at either 0, 6 months or 0, 12 months)
than in girls and women 16 to 26 years of age who received 3 doses of Gardasil 9 (at 0, 2, 6 months)
for each of the 9 vaccine HPV types. On the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the efficacy of a
2-dose regimen of Gardasil 9 in girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years is inferred. 
In the same study, in girls and boys aged 9 to14 years, GMTs at one month after the last vaccine dose
were numerically lower for some vaccine types after a 2-dose schedule than after a 3-dose schedule
(i.e., HPV types 18, 31, 45, and 52 after 0, 6 months and HPV type 45 after 0, 12 months). The clinical
relevance of these findings is unknown. 
In girls and boys receiving 2 doses at 6- or 12-month interval (+/- 1-month), persistence of antibody
response was demonstrated through Month 36; depending on HPV type, 81 % to 99 % of girls and
boys receiving 2 doses at 6-month interval and 88 % to 100 % of girls and boys receiving 2 doses at
12-month interval were seropositive. At Month 36, the GMTs in girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years
receiving 2 doses at a 6-month interval (+/- 1-month) remained non-inferior to GMTs in women aged
16 to 26 years receiving 3 doses of Gardasil 9.
In a clinical trial, persistence of antibody response has been demonstrated for at least 10 years in girls
aged 9 to13 years who received 2 doses of qHPV vaccine.
Duration of protection of a 2-dose schedule of Gardasil 9 has not been established.
Pregnancy
Specific studies of Gardasil 9 in pregnant women were not conducted. The qHPV vaccine was used as
an active control during the clinical development program for Gardasil 9.
During the clinical development of Gardasil 9; 2,586 women (1,347 in the Gardasil 9 group vs. 1,239
in the qHPV vaccine group) reported at least one pregnancy. The types of anomalies or proportion of
pregnancies with an adverse outcome in individuals who received Gardasil 9 or qHPV vaccine were
15
comparable and consistent with the general population (see section 4.6).
Prevention of juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP) by vaccination of
girls and women of childbearing potential
JoRRP is caused by upper airway infection primarily with HPV types 6 and 11, acquired vertically
(mother-to-child) during childbirth. Observational studies in the US and Australia have shown that the
introduction of qHPV vaccine since 2006 has led to declines in the incidence of JoRRP at population
level.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Not applicable.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
A repeat dose toxicity study in rats, which included an evaluation of single-dose toxicity and local
tolerance, revealed no special hazards to humans.
Gardasil 9 administered to female rats had no effects on mating performance, fertility, or
embryonic/foetal development.
Gardasil 9 administered to female rats had no effects on development, behaviour, reproductive
performance or fertility of the offspring. Antibodies against all 9 HPV types were transferred to the
offspring during gestation and lactation.

important information for you or your child.
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

6.   Contents of the pack and other information
Possible side effects
1.  What Gardasil 9 is and what it is used for
Gardasil 9 is a vaccine for children and adolescents from 9 years of age and adults. It is given to
protect against diseases caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52
and 58.
These diseases include pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the female genitals (cervix, vulva, and
vagina), pre-cancerous lesions and cancers of the anus and genital warts in males and females.
Gardasil 9 has been studied in males 9 to 26 years of age and females 9 to 45 years of age.
Gardasil 9 protects against the HPV types that cause most cases of these diseases.
Gardasil 9 is intended to prevent these diseases. The vaccine is not used to treat HPV related diseases.
Gardasil 9 does not have any effect in individuals who already have a persistent infection or disease
associated with any of the HPV types in the vaccine. However, in individuals who are already infected
with one or more of the vaccine HPV types, Gardasil 9 can still protect against diseases associated
with the other HPV types in the vaccine.
Gardasil 9 cannot cause HPV-related diseases.
When an individual is vaccinated with Gardasil 9, the immune system (the body’s natural defence
system) stimulates production of antibodies against the nine vaccine HPV types, to help protect
against the diseases caused by these viruses.
If you or your child receive a first dose of Gardasil 9, you have to complete the full vaccination course
with Gardasil 9.
If you or your child already received an HPV vaccine, ask your doctor if Gardasil 9 is right for you.
Gardasil 9 should be used in accordance with official guidelines.
32
2.  What you need to know before you or your child receive Gardasil 9
Do not receive Gardasil 9 if you or your child
• 
is allergic to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed
under “other ingredients”, in section 6).
developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Gardasil or Silgard (HPV types 6, 11,
16, and 18) or Gardasil 9.
• 
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or your child:
• 
has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example
haemophilia;
• 
• 
has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, HIV infection or
medicines that affect the immune system;
suffer from an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for
example having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.
Fainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle
injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if fainting occurred with a previous injection.
As with any vaccine, Gardasil 9 may not fully protect all of those who get the vaccine.
Gardasil 9 will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus. Therefore appropriate
precautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. If you are a woman, you should
continue to follow your doctor’s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and
protective measures.
What other important information should you or your child know about Gardasil 9
The duration of protection is not yet known. Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to determine
whether a booster dose is needed.
Other medicines and Gardasil 9
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any
other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Gardasil 9 can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d) and tetanus (T)
with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated] (IPV) (dTap,
dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of your body, for example the
other arm or leg) during the same visit.
Gardasil 9 may not have an optimal effect if used with medicines that suppress the immune system.
Hormonal contraceptives (for example the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Gardasil 9.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or
pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine. Information from pregnant women vaccinated
with Gardasil 9 does not show a higher risk for miscarriages or babies with birth defects.
However, if you are pregnant or if you become pregnant during the course of vaccination, it is
recommended to postpone or interrupt vaccination until you are no longer pregnant.
Gardasil 9 may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.
33
Driving and using machines
Gardasil 9 may slightly and temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4
“Possible side effects”).
Gardasil 9 contains sodium chloride
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
3.  How Gardasil 9 is given
Gardasil 9 is given as an injection by your doctor. Gardasil 9 is intended for adolescents and adults
from 9 years of age onwards.
If you are from 9 to and including 14 years of age at time of first injection
Gardasil 9 can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule:
- 
- 
If the second vaccine dose is administered earlier than 5 months after the first dose, a third dose should
always be administered.
First injection: at chosen date
Second injection: given between 5 and 13 months after first injection
First injection: at chosen date
Second injection: 2 months after first injection (not earlier than one month after the first dose) 
Third injection: 6 months after first injection (not earlier than 3 months after the second dose)
Gardasil 9 can be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:
- 
- 
- 
All three doses should be given within a 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more
information.
If you are from 15 years of age at time of first injection
Gardasil 9 should be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:
- 
- 
- 
All three doses should be given within a 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more
information.
First injection: at chosen date
Second injection: 2 months after first injection (not earlier than one month after the first dose)
Third injection: 6 months after first injection (not earlier than 3 months after the second dose)
It is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil 9 complete the vaccination
course with Gardasil 9.
Gardasil 9 will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the
upper arm or thigh).
If you forget one dose of Gardasil 9
If a scheduled injection is missed, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.
It is important that you follow your doctor or nurse’s instructions regarding return visits for the follow-
up doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor
for advice. When Gardasil 9 is given as your first dose, the completion of the vaccination course
should be done with Gardasil 9, and not another HPV vaccine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4. 
Possible side effects

Gardasil 9 is a vaccine for children and adolescents from 9 years of age and adults. It is given to
protect against diseases caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52

• 
has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example
haemophilia;
• 
• 
has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect, HIV infection or
medicines that affect the immune system;
suffer from an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for
example having a cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.
Fainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in adolescents) following any needle
injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if fainting occurred with a previous injection.
As with any vaccine, Gardasil 9 may not fully protect all of those who get the vaccine.
Gardasil 9 will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus. Therefore appropriate
precautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. If you are a woman, you should
continue to follow your doctor’s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and
protective measures.
What other important information should you or your child know about Gardasil 9
The duration of protection is not yet known. Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to determine
whether a booster dose is needed.
Other medicines and Gardasil 9
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any
other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Gardasil 9 can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d) and tetanus (T)
with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated] (IPV) (dTap,
dT-IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site (another part of your body, for example the
other arm or leg) during the same visit.
Gardasil 9 may not have an optimal effect if used with medicines that suppress the immune system.
Hormonal contraceptives (for example the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Gardasil 9.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or
pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine. Information from pregnant women vaccinated
with Gardasil 9 does not show a higher risk for miscarriages or babies with birth defects.
However, if you are pregnant or if you become pregnant during the course of vaccination, it is
recommended to postpone or interrupt vaccination until you are no longer pregnant.
Gardasil 9 may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.
40
Driving and using machines
Gardasil 9 may slightly and temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4
“Possible side effects”).
Gardasil 9 contains sodium chloride
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
3.  How Gardasil 9 is given
Gardasil 9 is given as an injection by your doctor. Gardasil 9 is intended for adolescents and adults
from 9 years of age onwards.
If you are from 9 to and including 14 years of age at time of first injection
Gardasil 9 can be administered according to a 2-dose schedule:

Second injection: given between 5 and 13 months after first injection
First injection: at chosen date
Second injection: 2 months after first injection (not earlier than one month after the first dose) 
Third injection: 6 months after first injection (not earlier than 3 months after the second dose)
Gardasil 9 can be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:
- 
- 
- 
All three doses should be given within a 1-year period. Please speak to your doctor for more
information.
If you are from 15 years of age at time of first injection
Gardasil 9 should be administered according to a 3-dose schedule:

It is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Gardasil 9 complete the vaccination
course with Gardasil 9.
Gardasil 9 will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the
upper arm or thigh).
If you forget one dose of Gardasil 9
If a scheduled injection is missed, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.
It is important that you follow your doctor or nurse’s instructions regarding return visits for the follow-
up doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor
for advice. When Gardasil 9 is given as your first dose, the completion of the vaccination course
should be done with Gardasil 9, and not another HPV vaccine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Dasatinib exposure variability is higher under fasted 
from existing and new pharmacokinetics (PK)  
analyses together with a review of literature data on 
the dasatinib PK profile in fasted conditions to assess 
implications arising for the recommendation for 
administration, as requested by the CHMP. In 
addition, the local representative’s details for 
Germany have been updated. Minor editorial changes 
have been introduced throughout the Product 
Information. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
conditions (47% CV) compared to light-fat meal (39% CV) 
and high-fat meal (32% CV) conditions. Based on the 
patient population PK analysis, variability in dasatinib 
exposure was estimated to be mainly due to inter-occasion 
variability in bioavailability (44% CV) and, to a lesser 
extent, due to inter-individual variability in bioavailability 
and inter-individual variability in clearance (30% and 32% 
CV, respectively). The random inter-occasion variability in 
exposure is not expected to affect the cumulative exposure 
and efficacy or safety.

dasatinib. Based on human experience, dasatinib is 
suspected to cause congenital malformations including 
neural tube defects, and harmful pharmacological effects 
on the foetus when administered during pregnancy.  
SPRYCEL should not be used during pregnancy unless the 
clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with 
dasatinib. If SPRYCEL is used during pregnancy, the patient 
must be informed of the potential risk to the foetus. 
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to use 
effective contraception during treatment.

continued high rates of cCCyR along with higher rates of 
MMR which are expected to translate into long term clinical 
benefit of dasatinib over imatinib. It is noted that the time 
to achieving a cCCyR and MMR was faster with dasatinib. 
Also, transformation to accelerated or blast phase occurred 
in fewer dasatinib-treated subjects compared with imatinib-
treated subjects. As expected PFS and OS data remain 
immature. High rates of PFS and OS that were comparable 
across both treatment groups were observed, although 
fewer progressions were observed in the dasatinib group 
compared with the imatinib.   
The safety profile is still acceptable; it is manageable and 
comparable to that of imatinib. No new concerns have been 
identified with the 48 month follow up.

Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) submitted results of 
the 36-month update of Study CA180056.  
Submission of the 36 months results from study CA180056 
showed continued high rates of cCCyR along with higher 
rates of MMR which are expected to translate into long 
term clinical benefit of dasatinib over imatinib. It is noted 
that the time to achieving a cCCyR and MMR was faster 
with dasatinib. Also, transformation to accelerated or blast 
phase occurred in fewer dasatinib-treated subjects 
compared with imatinib-treated subjects. As expected PFS 
and OS data remain immature. High rates of PFS and OS 
that were comparable across both treatment groups were 
observed, although fewer progressions were observed in 
the dasatinib group compared with the imatinib.   
The safety profile is still acceptable; it is manageable and 
comparable to that of imatinib. No new concerns have been 
identified with the 36 month follow up.  
The MAH will continue to provide yearly updates in order to 
obtain longer follow-up in terms of overall survival.

the approval of dasatinib at 100 mg QD in patients with 
chronic phase CML and at 140 mg QD in advanced disease 
CML and in Ph+ ALL. 
The results from this 5 year follow-up in CA180034 confirm 
the findings of earlier analyses that patients achieved 
clinical benefit on therapy with dasatinib. Treatment with 
100 mg QD continues to provide efficacy similar to the 
initially approved dose of 70 mg BID.  
The safety analysis from CA180034 and the pooled safety 
analysis confirmed the tolerability of dasatinib.  
As a consequence, sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Sprycel remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
- 
Sprycel has been approved based on surrogate 
efficacy endpoints and further surveillance of the mortality 
rate is required.  
- 
The additional issue of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension has been identified during the period covered 
by this renewal and requires updates of the product 
information and risk minimisation activities. 
- 
The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to 
submit yearly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Sprycel, which 
requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

dasatinib in healthy subjects. 
A total of 14 subjects entered the study and received study 
medication. Thirteen (13) subjects completed the study. A 
single oral dose of 100 mg dasatinib was administered to 
subjects in the morning at approximately 9:00 a.m. on 
Days 1 and 6 in a fasted condition. Omeprazole was 
administered once daily in the morning at approximately 
11:00 a.m. on Days 2 through 6 in a fasted condition.  
In a study of 14 healthy subjects, administration of a single 
100 mg dose of Sprycel 22 hours following a 4-day, 40-mg 
omeprazole dose at steady state reduced the AUC of 
dasatinib by 43% and the Cmax of dasatinib by 42%.

SPC and to update the list of local representatives in

(MAH) provided up to 36 months of follow-up safety data in 
clinical studies. The results of updated analyses confirm 
initial findings of a dose of 100 mg QD in chronic phase 
CML and use of 140 mg QD in advanced phase CML and 
Ph+ALL. In updated analyses in the overall population of 
2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects with up to 36 months of 
follow-up, no new safety signals were identified compared 
with analyses performed with 24 months of follow-up in 
this clinical trial population. 
In line with 36-month follow-up data from clinical trials, 
section 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SPC) was updated to add "Hypoalbuminemia" as a rare 
event, to change the frequency of "Cholecystitis" from 
"rare" to "uncommon and to add "Genital swelling" under 
the footnote regarding "superficial oedema". 
Page 20/28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to the update from the studies, the safety data 
from the global marketed use of dasatinib included in the 
most recent Periodic Safety Update Report concludes that 
the safety profile of dasatinib remains similar to the profile 
established during clinical trials.  
However, the following adverse drug reactions reported 
during the post-marketing period have been added to 
section 4.8 of the SPC with a frequency "not known": atrial 
fibrillation/atrial flutter, thrombosis/embolism (including 
pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis), interstitial 
lung disease, and fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
Overall, review of the current data does not suggest that 
these post-marketing experiences have a clinically 
important impact that could change the risk-benefit profile 
of dasatinib.  
In addition, the following statement was included in section 
5.1 of the SPC to reflect the efficacy results from the 
previously submitted 24-month follow-up data: "In patients

embryofoetal development studies, dasatinib likewise 
induced embryolethality with associated decreases in 
litter size in rats, as well as foetal skeletal alterations 
in both rats and rabbits. These effects occurred at 
doses that did not produce maternal toxicity,

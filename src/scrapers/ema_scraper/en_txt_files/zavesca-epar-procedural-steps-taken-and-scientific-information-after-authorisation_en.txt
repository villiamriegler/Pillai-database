are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II,  labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

23/08/2012 
The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations submitted by the MAH and 
having re-assessed the benefit/risk profile of the medicinal 
product, concluded that the benefit/risk balance for the 
product remains favourable.  
The CHMP considered that, as all Specific Obligations have 
been fulfilled, there are no remaining grounds for the 
Marketing Authorisations to remain under exceptional 
circumstances.

The MAH updated sections 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, and 5.1 of 
17/11/2011 
22/12/2011 
SmPC,  Annex 
This variation concerns amendment of Product Information 
the SmPC  in order to include new information on the 
results from clinical studies performed in fulfilment of 
two specific obligations. The Package Leaflet 
(sections 2 and 4) was updated in accordance. Annex 
II,  section IIC,  was updated accordingly to reflect the 
requested fulfilment of the specific obligations SO2 
and SO3. Minor linguistic improvements in the Polish 
Annexes I–III  of Zavesca are made. Minor changes 
in the wording of section 4.4 of the SmPC  were also 
implemented in order to improve clarity. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet.  
Furthermore, the MAH used this opportunity to bring 
the PI in line with the QRD template version 7.3.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the SmPC  and Package Leaflet. 
II  and PL 
for Zavesca based on the results obtained from the two 
recently completed studies (OGT 918-011 and OGT 918-
018) and from the analysis of the updated pooled safety 
data. The results were submitted in fulfilment of specific 
obligations SO2 and SO3. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC  was amended to add information 
obtained from study OGT 918-011, which was an open-
label, non comparative, 2-year study enrolled 42 patients 
with type 1 Gaucher disease, who had received a minimum 
of 3 years of ERT and who fulfilled criteria of stable disease 
for at least 2 years. The patients were switched to 
monotherapy with miglustat 100 mg t.i.d. Liver volume 
(primary efficacy variable) was unchanged from baseline to 
the end of treatment. Six patients had miglustat treatment 
prematurely discontinued for potential disease worsening, 
as defined in the study. Twenty-one patients completed 24 
months of miglustat treatment. Of these, 18 patients at

C.I.4  - Variations related to significant modifications

baseline were within established therapeutic goals for liver 
of the SPC  due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
counts, and 16 patients remained within all these 
therapeutic goals at Month 24. 
In section 4.4 of the SmPC,  information about the need to 
re-assess risk-benefit in patients who develop symptoms 
such as numbness and tingling is deleted and this is based 
on the results of studies OGT 918-011 and OGT 918-018. 
Section 4.8 and 4.7 were updated with information related 
tt adverse events and their frequency, as observed in the 
above studies.

that, overall, the benefit/risk ratio for the product remains

authorisation of miglustat.  
In addition the Package Leaflet was updated to

on the effect of miglustat on bone disease from three 
clinical trials (OGT 918-001, OGT 918-004, OGT 918-005). 
Furthermore, the MAH provided a discussion on the 
comparability between miglustat and intravenous enzyme 
replacement treatment (ERT) as well as on the severity 
assessment at baseline in patients treated with miglustat.  
Addition of descriptive data to section 5.1 was seen as 
adding value to the prescriber and was therefore 
recommended by the CHMP.  Finally, the CHMP endorsed 
the changes to aspects of the wording covering on the 
comparison between miglustat and ERT and for experience 
in severely affected patients.

A pooled analysis of safety data has been performed for all

disease indication. Also data from an observational study in

neuropathy and cognitive disturbance have been 
included in section 4.8 of the SPC  and a 
corresponding warning for peripheral neurophathy 
has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC  based on 
data from an observational study. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
patients with type 1 Gaucher disease not exposed to 
miglustat were submitted. 
Considering that only one case of cognitive function was 
reported as related to treatment at the time of the initial 
marketing authorisation, and that no additional reports 
have been obtained, neither in clinical trials nor in the 
Periodic safety Update Reports, the warning in section 4.4 
of the SPC  concerning the recommendation for periodic 
assessment of cognitive function has been deleted.  
The results from trial OGT 918-018 indicate that peripheral 
neuropathy may be more common in patients with type 1 
Gaucher disease compared to the general population, and 
therefore section 4.4 of the SPC  has been updated to 
reflect this information.  
A section concerning exposure and incidence across 
different patient groups has been included in section 4.8 of 
the SPC as well as reclassification of several adverse drug 
reactions. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Based on the CHMP  review of the available information and 
II,  Labelling 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
and PL 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Zavesca continues 
to be favourable but its safety profile is to be monitored. 
Page 11/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are still ongoing studies (including the post 
marketing surveillance plan) which will provide further 
information on the safety of Zavesca, including information 
on neurological, neuropsychological and gastrointestinal 
effects. 
Due to potential safety issues the CHMP decided that the 
MAH should continue to submit yearly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the above safety concern of 
Zavesca, the submission of yearly PSURs is required. The 
CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

overall, the benefit/risk ratio for the product remains 
unchanged. 
Amendments were made to section 5.2 and section 4.8 of 
the SPC.  The PL  has also been amended (changes in details 
of local representatives).  
The CHMP considered that the Marketing Authorisation for 
Zavesca should remain under exceptional circumstances in

The section 5.3 of the SPC has been updated with the 
Characteristics (SPC) following the fulfillment of two 
results of two rodent carcinogenicity studies which have 
Follow-Up Measures: a 104-week mouse 
carcinogenicity study and a 2-year rat carcinogenicity 
study. This led also to amendments in sections 4.4 
been finalised: a 104-week mouse carcinogenicity study 
and a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. In the mouse study 
there were an increased incidence of inflammatory and

In addition, contact details of Bulgarian and

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
corresponded to 16, 32 and 65/38 times the recommended 
human dose. Carcinomas in large intestine occurred 
occasionally at all doses with a statistically significant 
increase in the high dose group. In view of these results 
the MAH also discussed the human gastrointestinal safety 
of Zavesca on the basis of data from clinical trials and post-
marketing experience. The evaluation of these data led to 
an update of the warnings in relation to gastrointestinal 
effects, mainly diarrhoea including recommendations for 
further investigation of patients with chronic diarrhoea or 
other persistent gastrointestinal events. 
Section 2 of the PL has also been updated to reflect this 
warning.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tasigna is indicated for the treatment of: 
• 
• 
paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic 
myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase, 
paediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in chronic phase with resistance 
or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
CML in childhood is rare, accounting for less than 3% of all paediatric leukaemias. The incidence 
increases with age, being exceptionally rare in infancy at 0.7/million/year at ages 1 to 14 years and 
rising to 1.2/million/year in adolescents (Suttorp and Millot 2010). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Chronic myelogenous leukaemia is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by clonal expansion of 
hematopoietic stem cells expressing the BCR-ABL gene. The initial, chronic phase (CP) of CML is 
characterized by overproduction of immature myeloid cells and mature granulocytes in the spleen, 
bone marrow, and peripheral blood. If untreated, the disease progresses to an accelerated phase (AP), 
marked by the presence of primitive blast cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, followed by a 
terminal blast-crisis (BC) phase. Patients with persistent molecular disease are also at risk for 
progression. Inhibition of the BCR –ABL TK is an effective treatment modality for Ph+ CML.  
Similarly to adults, the pathology in CML in children is driven by the BCR -ABL fusion protein, a product 
of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which is formed by a translocation between the long arms of 
chromosomes 9 and 22. As in adults, the disease is characterized by progression through defined 
stages, starting with the relatively long-lasting chronic phase (CP), then accelerated phase (AP), and 
finally blast crisis (BC) (Melo and Barnes 2007). 
Though the disease aetiology shows no difference between adults and children, some differences are 
observed with respect to a different breakpoint distribution pattern in the BCR gene and a higher 
proportion of breakpoints within Alu repeat regions in children compared with adults with CML-CP. This 
could be the reason for a more aggressive clinical presentation of the disease (markedly raised 
leukocyte count and higher rate of splenomegaly) in children (Tanizawa 2016). 
However, similar to adults, not all paediatric patients respond to or tolerate imatinib treatment, and 
resistance to imatinib during treatment may develop, usually through the emergence of point 
mutations in BCR-ABL; other mechanisms of resistance include genomic amplification of BCR-ABL and 
modulation of drug transporters (Melo and Chuah 2007).

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Common signs and symptoms of CML CP, when present, result from anaemia and splenomegaly. These 
include fatigue, weight loss, malaise and left upper quadrant fullness or pain. Rare manifestations 
include bleeding (associated with a low platelet count and/or platelet dysfunction), thrombosis 
(associated with thrombocytosis and/or marked leukocytosis), gouty arthritis (from elevated uric acid 
levels), retinal haemorrhages and upper gastrointestinal ulceration (from elevated histamine levels due 
to basophilia). Leukostatic symptoms (priapism, dyspnoea, drowsiness, loss of coordination, confusion) 
due to leukaemic cells sludging in the blood vessels are uncommon in CP despite white blood cell 
(WBC) count often exceeding 100 ×109/L. Splenomegaly is the most consistent physical sign detected 
in 40%–50% of cases. Headaches, bone pain, arthralgias, pain from splenic infarction and fever are 
more frequent with CML transformation. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Prior to the availability of imatinib, IFN-α was the treatment of choice for adult and paediatric patients 
not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), with patients who achieved complete 
cytogenetic response on IFN surviving more than a decade.  
However, only a small proportion (5–10%) of patients responds to IFN. Therefore, until 2000, although 
the morbidity and mortality attributable to HSCT were appreciable, it was state of the art to offer HSCT 
to younger patients who had suitable HLA-matched donors. The risk factors and outcomes of HSCT in 
children are considered comparable to those in young adult patients (Suttorp 2008). 
The availability of imatinib (first approved for the use in children in 2001) resulted in a dramatic 
reduction in the frequency of HSCT in paediatric CML patients, and it has now become the standard 
first-line treatment in paediatric patients. Imatinib is approved in paediatric patients with newly 
diagnosed Ph+ CML for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of 
treatment, and in paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in CP after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in 
AP or BC. Imatinib has reduced the yearly risk of progression from CP to advanced stages to less than 
1% per year. In a study conducted in 51 paediatric patients with de novo CML-CP, the CCyR rate was 
64.7%, and the MMR rate was 27.3% (Champagne et al 2011). Similar results were reported by Millot 
et al (2011) in a study conducted in 44 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, with CCyR 
and MMR rates of 61% and 31%, respectively, at 12 months. 
However, imatinib and second generation TKIs seems not curing the disease and in the majority of 
patients leukemic cells will persist; furthermore not all patients respond to, or tolerate imatinib as first 
line treatment. Some patients who initially respond to imatinib subsequently relapse, usually due to 
the emergence of mutations in BCR-ABL that confer resistance to imatinib, or due to overexpression of 
the BCR-ABL protein. 
An unmet medical need exists for alternative, more effective treatment options in paediatric patients 
with CML. Considering that imatinib is currently the only approved BCR-ABL-targeted TKI in paediatric 
patients with CML-CP, other therapeutic alternatives particularly in children in whom resistance or 
intolerance to imatinib develops, is needed.  
About the product 
Nilotinib is a potent inhibitor of the ABL tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein both in cell 
lines and in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells. The substance binds with high 
Assessment report  
EMA/54558/2018  
Page 9/96 
 
 
 
 
 
affinity to the ATP-binding site in such a manner that it is a potent inhibitor of wild-type BCR-ABL and 
maintains activity against 32/33 imatinib-resistant mutant forms of BCR-ABL. As a consequence of this 
biochemical activity, nilotinib selectively inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis in cell lines and 
in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells from CML patients. In murine models of 
CML, as a single agent nilotinib reduces tumour burden and prolongs survival following oral 
administration (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Dosing in paediatric patients is individualised and is based on body surface area (mg/m2). The 
recommended dose of Tasigna is 230 mg/m2 twice daily, rounded to the nearest 50 mg dose (to a 
maximum single dose of 400 mg). Different strengths of Tasigna hard capsules can be combined to 
attain the desired dose (SmPC, section 4.2). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication:  
Tasigna is indicated for the treatment of: 
- paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous 
leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase, 
- paediatric patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with resistance or 
intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. 
The CHMP adopted this indication without changes. 
For dosing of paediatric patients with small body weight and children who cannot swallow the available 
150 mg or 200 mg capsule, a smaller 50 mg capsule with the same qualitative composition as the 
authorised 150 mg and 200 mg strengths was developed.  The request for marketing authorisation for 
the new 50 mg capsule strength is also part of this application. 
The application for extending the indication to include the treatment of paediatric patients with Ph+ 
CML-CP is based on data from two clinical studies in paediatric patients which were conducted in 
accordance with the approved Tasigna PIP: 
• 
Study CAMN107A2120 was a Phase I, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and preliminary efficacy of nilotinib at a dose of 230 mg/m2 twice daily 
in paediatric patients with Ph+ CML resistant or intolerant to imatinib or dasatinib (n=11) or 
refractory/relapsed Ph+ acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL; n=4). The study was completed as planned, 
after all patients had completed at least 12 treatment cycles of 28 days or discontinued early from the 
study. 
• 
Study CAMN107A2203 is a Phase II, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of nilotinib 230 mg/m2 twice daily conducted in 58 pediatric patients with Ph+ CML (33 patients 
were resistant or intolerant to imatinib or dasatinib, and 25 patients were newly diagnosed). At the 
time of the data cut-off of the primary analysis (01-Jun-2016), all patients had completed at least 12 
cycles of 28 days of treatment, or discontinued early. The study is ongoing, and will continue for a total 
of 66 cycles.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 50 mg of nilotinib hydrochloride 
monohydrate as active substance.  
Other ingredients of the hard capsule content are lactose monohydrate, crospovidone, poloxamer, 
silica colloidal anhydrous and magnesium stearate. The hard capsule shell is composed of gelatin, 
titanium dioxide (E171), red iron oxide (E172) and yellow iron oxide (E172); and the printing ink is 
composed of shellac, propylene glycol, ammonium hydroxide and black iron oxide (E172) 
The product is available in PVC/PVDC/Alu blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used for the proposed Tasigna 50 mg hard capsules is the same as that for the 
already approved Tasigna 150 mg and 200 mg hard capsules. The information on the active substance 
is described in the quality dossier which was previously reviewed and approved as part of the Tasigna 
150 mg and 200 mg strength marketing authorisation applications. No new information is provided 
with this application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as a hard gelatine capsule with immediate release dosage form for 
oral administration. It is a hard capsule size 4 with red opaque cap with black radial imprint “NVR” 
above “ABL” and light yellow opaque body, containing white to yellowish powder. 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an immediate release solid dosage 
form for oral administration containing 50 mg of nilotinib hydrochloride monohydrate to extend the 
current indication to include the treatment of paediatric patients. 
The pharmaceutical development of this new strength is supported by the data generated by the drug 
product development of the 200 mg and 150 mg hard capsules, which are currently the approved 
dosage strengths of nilotinib. The composition of the capsule fill is qualitatively identical for all dosage 
strengths. They differ only in the amount of capsule fill filled in the capsule shell, the capsule colour, 
size and imprint.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. Compatibility between the drug substance and excipients has been demonstrated. The 
same manufacturing process of wet granulation was chosen for the new strength. 
Particle sizes are not critical for the dissolution. The development of the dissolution method is 
adequately described and the discriminatory properties have been satisfactorily demonstrated. The 
dissolution method for routine testing is identical to the already marketed 150 mg and 200 mg hard 
capsules and the dissolution profiles across the dosage strengths are similar.

The primary packaging for Tasigna is PVC/ PVDC (duplex) blister packs, consisting of a PVC/ PVDC film 
backed with a heat sealable lacquered aluminium foil. The PVDC film is in contact with the drug 
product. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. The primary packaging material complies with EU-
Regulations No.10/2011 and No.1935/2004/EC. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Tasigna 50 mg hard capsules is considered as a standard process which 
comprises the following main steps: mixing, wet-granulation, drying, blending, capsule filling and 
primary packaging. 
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. It is the same used for the 
manufacture of the 150 mg and 200 mg capsules already approved. A common blend is used for the 
manufacture of all strengths.   
The manufacturing process for the common blend, later encapsulated into 50 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg 
hard capsules, has previously been validated during the manufacture of the initially registered 
strengths 150 mg and 200 mg.  
The critical steps in the manufacturing process of Tasigna 50 mg hard capsules are controlled by the 
in-process controls (IPCs) during the manufacturing process, which have been presented and are 
adequately justified. The control strategy ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers 
a product that meets the defined criteria for all release specifications.  
A bulk holding time for capsules prior to primary packaging has been established, supported with 
provided stability data. 
It is considered that the manufacturing process of 50 mg capsules is sufficiently robust to provide 
assurance that hard capsules of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification, are 
produced. 
Product specification 
The specification of Tasigna 50 mg hard capsules for batch release and shelf-life includes the following 
tests: appearance (visual examination), identification (UV and HPLC), mean mass of capsules content 
(weight), dissolution (UV), impurities (HPLC), microbial limit tests (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage 
units (Ph. Eur.) and assay (HPLC).  
Adequate specifications for control of the finished product at release and during shelf-life have been 
established. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of finished product has been 
presented. 
The batch analysis data from a verification commercial scale batch of Tasigna 50 mg hard capsules has 
been provided. In addition, batch analysis from three pre-validation batches and a clinical batch 
manufactured from the full common blend has also been provided. The results complied with the 
proposed specifications, providing evidence that the quality of the finished product is properly 
controlled by the analytical methods and the set specifications.

Stability of the product 
Stability data of three pre-validation production scale batches (larger than the proposed commercial 
scale batches) manufactured from the full common blend of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for 36 months at 25ºC / 60% RH, for up to 36 months at intermediate conditions 30ºC / 
75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC / 75% RH, according to the ICH 
guidelines, were provided. The batches of Tasigna 50 mg hard capsules are representative of those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, mean mass of capsule content, dissolution, assay, degradation 
products and microbial purity. The methods used were the same as for release testing and are stability 
indicating. No changes in appearance, mean mass, or microbial testing were seen during storage at 
any of the storage conditions. A tendency for an increase in one degradation product was observed 
during storage. The increase is most pronounced at high temperature and humidity, but the results 
remains within specification and below the proposed limit. All results are within the specifications at 
long term storage conditions (25°C / 60% RH and 30°C / 75% RH). 
At accelerated storage conditions (40°C / 75% RH), an out of specification (OOS) result was observed 
for one of the tested parameters. Satisfactory investigation and explanation have been provided and  
proposed shelf-life and storage conditions reflect the findings of the stability. 
Stability testing has additionally been performed for up to 6 months at -20°C / ambient RH, up to 36 
months at 5°C / ambient RH and up to 3 months at 50°C / ambient RH. All batches met the 
specification criteria and the data show that the stability of the capsules is not impacted by freezing. 
A photostability study was carried out on one pre-validation scale batch in accordance with the ICH 
Q1B guideline. There was no significant difference in the results obtained for the directly exposed 
unpacked sample and the control. Therefore, it can be concluded that the finished product is not 
sensitive to light. 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 36 months with the storage condition 
“do not store above 30°C” and “store in the original package in order to protect from moisture” as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable.

product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality perspective 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable. Physicochemical and biological aspects 
relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled 
in a satisfactory way.

N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.2.  Discussion and Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The justification provided by the MAH for not performing environmental risk assessment studies was 
considered acceptable. The addition of the paediatric population to the currently approved indications 
is not expected to significantly increase the use of nilotinib on the EU market. CML in childhood is rare, 
accounting for less than 10% of all cases of CML and less than 3% of all paediatric leukemias. The 
incidence increases with age, being exceptionally rare in infancy at 0.7/million/year at ages 1 to 14 
years and rising to 1.2/million/year in adolescents (Suttorp M, Millot F 2010). 
The most recent ERA (May 2016) as well as the SmPC already include a statement that any unused 
product should be disposed according to local regulations, and not be disposed of via domestic sewage. 
The inclusion of the paediatric indication would not warrant any additional cautionary statements; 
hence the absence of a stand-alone ERA for this procedure is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Pharmacokinetics 
Data from patients with Ph+ CML-CP in studies A2203 and A2120 were pooled and the following 
populations were used for various analyses: 
• 
• 
• 
Pooled patients with Ph+ CML-CP or ALL in both A2120 and A2203 (for dose-exposure 
analyses) 
Pooled patients with Ph+ CML-CP in both A2120 and A2203 (for dose-exposure analyses) 
Pooled patients with Ph+ CML-CP resistant/intolerant to either imatinib/dasatinib in both A2120 
and A2203 (for dose-exposure and exposure-response analyses), and 
•  Newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP patients, from only A2203 for dose-exposure and exposure-
response analyses, as A2120 did not enroll newly diagnosed CML-CP patients. 
The following analyses were performed: 
•  Dose-Exposure – Inter/Intra-patient variability, ethnic sensitivity among Caucasians, Asians 
• 
• 
and others, as well as dose-exposure relationship after a single dose and multiple doses of 230 
mg/m2. These data are presented for the pooled PK population of studies, the pooled Ph+ CML-
CP PK population and the pooled imatinib/dasatinib resistant/intolerant PK population.  
Exposure-Efficacy – Trough concentrations vs. BCR-ABL/ABL% ratio over time, time averaged 
trough concentration vs. probability of major molecular response (MMR) at multiple time 
points.  
Exposure-Safety – Concentration vs. ECG parameter prolongation, last observed trough 
concentration prior to onset vs. probability of adverse events of special interest (AESI) and 
time of AESI, last observed trough concentration prior to onset of event vs. probability of 
hepatic abnormality, time to ALT elevations vs. last observed trough concentration prior to 
elevation, normalized ALT elevations over time vs. time-averaged trough concentration until 
assessment of elevation. All exposure-response analyses were performed separately for the 
resistant/intolerant patients and for the newly diagnosed patients. Indications were not pooled.

Population PK analyses 
In addition, a population PK analysis was performed to characterize the PK of nilotinib and the effects 
of potential covariates, such as demographic and clinical factors, through the use of nonlinear mixed 
effects models. This report also summarized model-based population and individual predictions of PK 
exposure in pediatrics based on a dose of 230 mg/m2 twice daily compared to that of adults based on 
400 mg twice daily. 
The population PK analysis used the following data: 
• 
• 
• 
pediatric patients in Phase I [Study CAMN107A2120] (N=14 with evaluable PK) pediatric patients 
in Phase II [Study CAMN107A2203] (N=58 with evaluable PK) 
adult patients in [Study CAMN107A2101] with at least one PK profile for a 400 mg twice daily 
regimen (N=17) 
adult patients in [Study CAMN107A2303] with at least one PK profile for a 400 mg twice daily 
regimen (N=18) 
The inclusion of patients from the adult trials with at least one PK profile for a 400 mg twice daily dose 
was to provide a reference population at a comparable dose to that of pediatric patients in the analysis 
population and to not overwhelm the pediatric data with data from over 1000 adults with sparse data 
at various doses. 
This analysis adopted a two-compartment model, with an absorption lag time (ALAG1, h) followed by a 
zero-order absorption of duration (D1, h), and with elimination described by a first-order process. The 
covariates assessed included body size, age, liver function tests, indication, ethnicity, and gender. 
Covariates were incorporated into the model by forward selection (p<0.01) and backward elimination 
(p≥0.01). The following Figure 1 provides an overview:

Typical model-based population predictions of steady-state apparent clearance (CL/F1, L/h), BSA-
normalized clearance (L/h/m2), and three exposure measures − AUC (h × ng/mL), Ctrough (ng/mL), 
and Cmax (ng/mL) − were estimated at the median values of covariates within each age group 2 to < 
12 years, 12 to <18 years, and ≥ 18 years. Furthermore, 90% asymptotic confidence intervals on the 
ratios of AUC for each age group of children compared to adult AUC were computed based on the 
normal distribution of log transformed parameters. Model-based individual predictions of clearances 
and exposure measures were also summarized by age categories. Both typical population predictions 
and individual predictions were based on 400 mg twice daily dose for adults and based on 230 mg/m2 
twice daily dose rounded to the nearest multiple of 50 mg not to exceed 400 mg for children. 
PK parameters have been log-transformed to guarantee positive and asymmetric confidence intervals 
when untransformed.  PK parameters have been reported with summary statistics. 
The serum-concentrations of nilotinib were measured by validated liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay. LLOQ/ ULOQ was 2.50 ng/mL and 5000 ng/mL, respectively.

Dose-Exposure Relationship after single dose 
Nilotinib concentration after single dose was summarized for each designated post-dose time window 
by CML cohort, for the pooled CML population, and for the total population (CML and ALL). It was also 
summarized by age group (2 to <12 years, 12 to <18 years, pooled). 
In general, the observed concentrations of nilotinib at 1-5 h and 6-12 h post-single dose were 
comparable across the cohorts, within the respective age groups and time windows. During the 6-12h 
window, older patients generally had a higher exposure compared to younger patients, and older newly 
diagnosed patients had higher exposures compared to the other disease cohorts (Figure 2). The 
geometric-mean (geo-V%) values of the nilotinib concentrations at 6-12 h post dose were as follows: 
Age group: 2 to <12 years 
•  Newly diagnosed patients: 235 ng/mL (182%) 
•  Resistant/intolerant patients: 230 ng/mL (62.1%) 
• 
Paediatric patients (Ph+ CML-CP or ALL): 234 ng/mL (65.6%)

Paediatric patients (Ph+ CML-CP or ALL): 413 ng/mL (74.7%)

Dose-Exposure Relationship after multiple doses 
Exposure data after multiple doses was summarized by CML cohort, for the pooled CML population, and 
for the total population (CML and ALL). It was also summarized by age group (2 to <12 years, 12 to 
<18 years, pooled). Pre-dose (trough) concentrations were summarized by time point with the 
accumulation ratio from one observation to the next also presented. 
Trough concentrations were similar across the cohorts within the respective age groups. However, 12-
<18 years age group had slightly higher concentrations compared to the 2-<12 years age group. 
Following multiple oral doses of nilotinib, steady state concentrations were generally achieved as early 
as Cycle 1 Day 8 across the disease cohorts and age groups. However, in the 2-<12 years age group, 
an apparent increasing trend in concentration was observed over time.  At the end of the Cycle 1, the 
trough concentrations were at similar levels for both the 2-<12 and 12-<18 years groups. In the 12-
<18 years age group, the trough concentrations of nilotinib remained stable after Cycle 1 Day 8 up to 
Cycle 12 Day 28 (Figure 3). This notion was corroborated by the population PK analysis. The

geometric-mean (geo-CV%) ratio of accumulation from C1D8 to D15 and from C9D28 to C12D28 
across age groups and disease cohorts were as follows: 
Age group: 2 to <12 years 
•  Newly diagnosed patients: 1.17 (71.2%) and 1.00 (57.5%), respectively 
•  Resistant/intolerant patients: 0.902 (74.7%) and 1.13 (54.8%), respectively 
• 
Paediatric patients (Ph+ CML-CP or ALL): 0.977 (66.2%) and 1.06 (52.0%), respectively 
Age group: 12 to <18 years 
•  Newly diagnosed patients: 1.12 (57.3%) and 0.98 (46.4%), respectively 
•  Resistant/intolerant patients: 1.09 (101.7%) and 1.12 (32.3%), respectively 
• 
Paediatric patients (Ph+ CML-CP or ALL): 1.10 (83.0%) and 1.05 (39.1%), respectively 
Note: After Cycle 1 Day 28, no additional PK data was available for the ALL patients from A2120 study. 
Hence, after Cycle 1 Day 28, concentrations were identical for pooled paediatric patients and pooled 
CML patients. There were no ALL patients in 12-<18 years age group.

•  Gender 
The  effect  of  gender  was  investigated  by  comparing  dose-adjusted  trough  concentrations  of  nilotinib 
between  male  and  female  patients  using  a  linear  mixed  effects  model.  The  analysis  was  performed 
using dose-adjusted exposure (adjusted to 1 mg) such that any differences between genders were not 
subject  to  differences  in  doses  across  patients  of  different  ages.  For  newly  diagnosed  patients,  race 
and BSA both had a significant effect on exposure and were therefore kept in the model. Model based 
comparisons between genders were therefore conducted adjusted for race and BSA.

•  Children 
Study CAMN107A2120 
Study  CAMN107A2120  was  a  multi-centre,  open-label  study  to  characterize  the  PK  of  nilotinib 
administered at a dose of 230 mg/m2 bid to paediatric patients (N=15) with  
•  Newly diagnosed CP-Ph+ CML (none recruited), or 
•  CP or AP-Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, (no AP patient recruited) or  
•  Relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL 
Patients were enrolled into two strata of two age groups: 
•  Group 1: 8 patients ages 1 year to < 10 years, and 
•  Group 2: 7 patients ages ≥ 10 years to < 18 years. 
Safety, tolerability, and activity (hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response) were to be 
assessed through EOS. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. The design of the study 
is consistent with the historic trial design   utilized for cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents in paediatric 
populations, beginning paediatric dose escalation at 70% to 80% of the adult MTD (600 mg bid). 
The primary objective of the study was to characterize the PK of nilotinib in paediatric patients with 
newly diagnosed CP-Ph+ CML, or CP or AP-Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, 
or refractory/relapsed Ph+ ALL to standard therapy. 
The study had the following secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability of nilotinib. 
To assess the pharmacodynamics of nilotinib by its activity (hematologic, cytogenetic, and 
molecular responses). 
• 
To assess mutations in BCR-ABL at baseline and at the end of treatment. 
Patients were administered nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid, orally, rounded to the nearest 50 mg (max single 
dose 400 mg) for 28 days (1 cycle) for up to 12 cycles prior to protocol amendment 3 and up to 24 
cycles post amendment 3. For patients having difficulty swallowing capsules, the capsule was opened 
and the contents administered with one teaspoon of apple sauce. Results from study [CAMN107A2127] 
showed that apple sauce did not have an impact on the PK of nilotinib. 
Both single- and multiple-dose PK of nilotinib were evaluated in paediatric patients, and compared 
against adult reference data from Study A2101, where patients received 400 mg bid 
[CAMN107A2101].  
Nilotinib shows moderate to high inter-patient variability in PK values (32% to 64% in AUC and 34% to 
72% in Cmax) in adult patients [CAMN107A2101-Phase IA]. Based on the observed variability as well 
as the safety profiles of nilotinib in adult patients, a two-fold difference in AUC or CL/F between adults 
and paediatrics was considered to be clinically meaningful, therefore, this difference was considered 
when comparing paediatric patients in A2120 to adult patients in A2101.

Evaluable pharmacokinetic data was available from 14 paediatric patients in study CAMN107A2120. 
The PK of nilotinib following the single dose were comparable between Group 1 (1 year to <10 years) 
and Group 2 (≥ 10 years to < 18 years), given the observed variability and low sample size. No 
marked difference was observed between Group 1 and 2 with regard to the steady-state PK exposure 
and clearance of nilotinib. The coefficient of variance (CV%) for the geometric means was also similar 
in both groups (30% or higher) (Table 5 and Table 6).

Study CAMN107A2203 
Study CAMN107A2203 was a multi-center, open-label, non-controlled Phase II study to assess efficacy, 
safety of 230 mg/m2 twice daily nilotinib in pediatric patients (1 to <18 years old). Three patient 
cohorts were planned based on the disease classification: 
• 
• 
Ph+ CML-CP patients resistant or intolerant to either imatinib or dasatinib, n=34 
Ph+ CML-AP patients resistant or intolerant to either imatinib or dasatinib, n=0 
•  Newly diagnosed Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase, n=25 
All patients are planned to be treated for 66 cycles.  
Overall, 30 patients in the resistant/intolerant cohort and 25 patients in the newly diagnosed cohort 
had evaluable PK data. In both the cohorts, steady state concentration was achieved approximately on 
C1D8. The geometric-mean (CV%) trough concentration of nilotinib were as follows: 
•  Resistant/intolerant cohort: 1407.89 ng/mL (41.67%) 
•  Newly diagnosed cohort: 1274.30 ng/mL (46.21%). 
The inter-patient variability was similar across the cohorts and was moderate for both the cohorts. 
Similar trend was observed for intra-patient variability across the cohorts (Table 8).

Population PK results 
The population PK analysis evaluated the impact of covariates such as body surface area, body weight, 
age, gender, indication, ethnicity, ALT, AST and total bilirubin on the PK. The final population PK model 
incorporated effects of BSA on volumes and clearances and total bilirubin on clearance.  
Typical population predictions of BSA-normalized clearances at median values of covariates in the 2 to 
< 12 years, 12 to < 18 years, and ≥ 18 years age groups were 16.0, 13.5, and 13.0 L/h/m2, 
respectively (Table 9). The changes in exposure as measured by steady-state AUC in pediatric patients 
following 230 mg/m2 bid dosing compared to that in adult patients following 400 mg bid dosing were -
6.1% (90% CI: -19% to 9%) in patients 2 to <12 years of age and -0.8% (90% CI: -5% to 3%) in 
patients 12 to <18 years of age.

A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been conducted including data from adults receiving 400 
mg twice daily (n=35) and paediatric patients receiving 230 mg/m2 twice daily (n=72). The paediatric 
dose was expected to be equivalent to the adult dose with respect of resulting exposure (AUC). The 
structural PK model used for nilotinib in adult patients was adopted in this analysis. It was a two-
compartment model, with an absorption lag time followed by a zero –order duration of absorption, and 
with elimination described by a first-order process. Body surface area was correlated with apparent 
clearances and volumes. Normalized total bilirubin was correlated with apparent clearance, which was 
similar to previous results in adults. The effects of body surface area played the major role for 
accounting for differences in pharmacokinetics between paediatrics (ages 2 to <18 y) and adults, and 
thus mg/m2 dosing was considered appropriate in paediatrics. 
PopPK and PBPK model 
Both the population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) and the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
model were developed and qualified to predict the nilotinib exposure in the paediatric population. The 
mechanism-based paediatric PBPK model combines and links physiological parameters and nilotinib 
drug-specific parameters in a physiologically realistic model (Johnson et al. 2011). The nilotinib PBPK 
model was initially constructed and verified using observed adult data. The pediatric population with 
integrated age-dependent CYP enzyme ontogeny profiles (Upreti 2016) was then used within the 
Simcyp paediatric module (Johnson et al. 2006; Johnson et al. 2011) to develop the paediatric nilotinib 
PBPK model. This pediatric PBPK model has been verified using the observed data in pediatric patients 
from 6 to 12 years of age. At age 2, CYP3A4 reaches full maturity and hence nilotinib clearance (CL) is 
determined by the hepatic flow rate and the liver size rather than CYP3A4 activity (Johnson, Rostami-
Hodjegan, & Tucker, 2006) 
PK parameters computed with each of the methods are presented in Table 10. Figure 5 and Figure 6 
show the population PK simulations and the simulations from the PBPK model in the pediatric 
population from 2 to <6 years of age, respectively.

The QTc prolongation potential and cardiac safety of nilotinib exposure in paediatrics was investigated 
with a linear mixed effects model for the change from baseline in QTcF, QTcB, and other ECG 
parameters (PR, HR, and QRS). 
Given the sparse sampling in paediatric patients, PopPK predictions of Cmax (estimated at 
Tmax=4.6h) were utilized to enhance the database and provide more robust assessments of ECG 
prolongation.

Nilotinib concentrations (trough concentrations on C1D8, D15, D22, D28, C3D28, C6D28, C9D28, 
C12D28, post-dose concentrations on C1D1 and D8) were associated with QTcF prolongation. An 
increase in trough concentration corresponded to an increase in change from baseline in QTcF interval. 
At the expected steady state exposure for 230 mg/m2 bid (C1D15), the estimated mean change in 
QTcF from baseline was 4.63 msec (SE: 2.13; 95% CI: 0.1698, 9.1) in newly diagnosed cohort, and 
4.15 msec (SE: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.75, 6.56) in the resistant/intolerant cohort.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of nilotinib in children have been investigated in two paediatric studies: a phase 
1 study (A2120) in 11 children with resistant/intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and four children with 
relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL and a phase 2 study (A2203) in 34 children with resistant/intolerant Ph+ 
CML-CP and 25 children with newly diagnosed Ph+CML-CP. Population PK analysis was performed with 
data from the paediatric trials and data from a study in adult patients. The presented methodology is 
in accordance with state-of-the-art procedures for PoP-PK analysis. The model development has been 
adequately documented and the final model is well validated. Goodness of fit plots and visual 
predictive checks (with 95% prediction intervals) support the final model.

Overall, the number of paediatric patients with evaluable PK data is acceptable. However, no data are 
available in children < 2 years of age and data in children < 5 years of age are limited. However, it is 
acknowledged that generation of more “real data” in children below the age of 6 is not feasible, due to 
the rarity of the disease and the competitive enrolment in other studies. The model used to simulate 
and predict PK in children below the age of 6 is adequate. Both the popPK model and a PBPK model 
consistently predict exposure in children below the age of 6 and have also compared the predicted PK 
results to the limited available observed data. This supports the suitability of the current PopPK model. 
The model indicated that BSA based-dosing also is suitable in children below the age of 6. It is 
acknowledged that generation of additional PK data in children below the age of 6 is infeasible. The 
PopPK model suggests BSA based dosing in also children below the age of 6 which is acceptable.  
However, although, most children had a high enough nilotinib exposure (>500 ng/ml), it is uncertain 
whether this will be the case for all children. To ensure that all children have a high enough nilotinib 
exposure, it is recommended to monitor the children for nilotinib concentrations. The CHMP 
recommended that the MAH will collect efficacy and exposure data in patients < 6 years and that 
based on this information the popPK model is updated in order to alleviate the current uncertainties 
related to this model. 
In both the paediatric studies, patients were administered 230 mg/m2 bid. The dose was expected to 
be comparable to the adult dose of 400 mg bid normalized to the typical BSA (= 1.73 m2). The 
paediatric dose was rounded to the nearest multiple of 50 mg (lowest tablet content of nilotinib) and 
should not exceed 400 mg bid. 
Results from both the individual studies and the population PK analysis indicated that the 
pharmacokinetics of nilotinib is comparable in paediatric and adult patients. The PK of nilotinib follows 
a two-compartment model with an absorption lag-time followed by zero-order absorption and first-
order elimination. The typical clearance was slightly higher in the youngest age group, but the impact 
on AUCss seems small. While exposure is slightly lower in the younger age groups due to higher 
clearance, the clinical importance seems to be small. Comparable predicted Ctrough/Cmin values for 
the 230 mg/m2 dose across age groups are reassuring. 
Following both single and multiple doses, exposure was slightly higher in the older children compared 
to the youngest age group. Data are limited in the age group 2 to <6 years, but exposure and 
variability appears to be comparable. Data are limited in the youngest age group, but overall, the 
model approach is acceptable and the 230 mg/m2 dose supported in CML patients from 2 to 18 years 
of age. Of the covariates evaluated in the population PK analysis BSA and total bilirubin was 
incorporated in the final model. BSA was the most important of the covariates, and this supports the 
BSA-based dosing in paediatric patients.  
The paediatric dose of 230 mg/m2 led to exposure comparable to that of adult patients after both 
multiple and single dose. There was no apparent differences in exposure across disease cohorts and 
within the age groups (2 to <10 and 12 - <18). The slightly higher clearance in the youngest age 
group is expected to have minimal impact on exposure. Generally, exposure in paediatric patients was 
comparable to exposure in the adults.   
An exposure-efficacy response relationship for nilotinib has been demonstrated in adult patients and 
could also be expected in a paediatric patient population.  
All exposure-response analyses were performed separately for each cohort, resistant/intolerant 
patients and newly diagnosed paediatric patients. The exposure-efficacy relation was investigated with 
trough concentrations vs. BCR-ABL/ABL% ratio over time and time-averaged trough concentration vs. 
probability of major molecular response (MMR) at multiple time points. The analysis did not reveal any

exposure-efficacy response relationship in paediatric patients. However since the exposure range was 
narrow as all paediatric patients were treated with a dose of 230 mg/m2 and the number of paediatric 
patients subgroups is limited, this could explain why no significant exposure-efficacy relationship could 
be found.  
The population PK analysis indicated that clearance was higher in the youngest age group, and 
exposure in the youngest age group was also slightly lower than the exposure in the oldest age group. 
Theoretically the lower exposure in the youngest could lead to diminished efficacy. However, data on 
exposure in the very young (< 5 years of age) are very limited.  However, there is evidence to support 
that the observed lower exposure in the youngest patients could have a negative effect on efficacy. 
Steady-state exposure was generally comparable across age groups. Also, no clear exposure-efficacy 
relationship was found within the range of observed exposures. No relationship between trough 
concentration and the probability of MMR has been established for either resistant/intolerant patients 
or newly diagnosed patients. A similar pattern of no relationship was found between trough 
concentrations and BCR-ABL% for both disease cohorts. 
No significant correlation between Ctrough and AESIs, AESIs grade 3-4 or hepatic abnormalities 
including bilirubin elevation was identified. This was consistent between cohorts. Recalculated AUCss 
predictions with patient characteristics and actual dose, not planned dose as requested, showed a 10 
% difference in AUCss, which is as expected, since the dose intensity is smaller than the planned dose. 
Exposure-response analysis with the recalculated AUCss confirm a strong relationship between AUCss 
and probability of bilirubin elevation.  
In line with what has been shown in adult patients, Ctrough concentration was associated with QTcF 
prolongation. As in adult patients, paediatric patients treated with nilotinib are at risk of QT 
prolongation and ECG should be monitored with ECG as described in the SmPC. No other correlations 
between exposure and other relevant ECG parameters, including heart rate was observed. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The chosen paediatric dose of 230 mg/m2 bid is supported. The two clinical studies in paediatric 
patients and the population PK analysis provide sufficient data to support that the pharmacokinetics 
including exposure in paediatric patients from the age of 5 are comparable to what has been 
established in adult patients dosed 400 mg bid.  
In conclusion, the new pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data submitted support the new 
indication.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study A2120 
The dose selection in paediatric patients was determined based on the results of Study A2101, which 
was conducted in adult patients with imatinib-resistant Ph+ CML, relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL, or 
other haematological malignancies, and Study A2303, which compared two doses of nilotinib (300 mg 
bid and 400 mg bid) with imatinib in adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP. The 
recommended dosage of nilotinib in adult patients was established to be 300 mg bid for newly

The PK, safety, and activity of nilotinib in paediatric patients was first evaluated in Study A2120 
conducted in paediatric patients with Ph+ disease (CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia; ALL), where 
patients were administered nilotinib at a dose of 230 mg/m2 bid, rounded to the nearest 50 mg dose, 
with a maximum single dose of 400 mg (see clinical pharmacology section). The dose of 230 mg/m2 
bid in children was selected to provide similar exposure as the dose of 400 mg bid in adults, 
considering that CML in children may be more aggressive than in adults (Tanizawa 2016), and in view 
of the dose of 400 mg bid being the dose for resistant or intolerant adult CML patients. The results 
confirmed 230 mg/m2 bid as the recommended dose in paediatric patients with Ph+ CML/ALL. This 
dose was subsequently evaluated and confirmed in Study A2203. 
The 230 mg/m2 dose was considered adequate for the Ph+ CML-CP and -AP paediatric patients 
resistant or intolerant to either imatinib or dasatinib as it was equivalent to the adult dose of 400 mg, 
indicated for this population. The 230 mg/m2 dose was also selected for newly diagnosed paediatric 
patients for the following reasons: 
• 
Overlapping PK results from the 300 mg and 400 mg bid dose and acceptable safety profile at 
the 400 mg dose level (CAMN107A2303). 
Interim analysis data from study CAMN107A2120 in a group of paediatric patients showed a 
• 
safety profile at the 230 mg/m2 dose consistent with that observed in adults while providing adequate 
PK exposure coverage of both the 300 mg and 400 mg bid adult doses. 
• 
A slightly higher dose than the 300 mg bid dose was considered as paediatric leukemia in some 
instances progresses more rapidly than in adults (Andolina 2012). The dose was adjusted to the body 
surface area and thereby, the chances of overexposure were reduced. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study A2203 
Methods

Treatments 
Nilotinib was administered orally at 230 mg/m2 bid, rounded to the nearest 50 mg dose (to a 
maximum single dose of 400 mg) for 28 days (one cycle) and for a total of up to 66 cycles (or 
discontinued early). 
Patients could receive hydroxyurea for 21 days or less for the treatment of CML but should discontinue 
treatment within one week after initiation of nilotinib. Patients were informed of a possible drug 
interaction with acetaminophen and asked to restrict the use of over-the-counter and prescription 
medicines containing acetaminophen. Patients on anticonvulsants were required to have regular 
monitoring of plasma concentration of these agents. Anti-diarrheal therapy was permitted at the 
Investigator’s discretion. 
Patients who were at high risk for developing tumor lysis syndrome were allowed to receive allopurinol. 
The colony-stimulating growth factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) such as sargramostim, filgrastim, and 
pegfilgrastim were permitted to treat recurrent grade 3 neutropenia. Antiemetic medication could be 
used as clinically indicated. Antiemetic medication that prolongs the QT-time such as domperidone was 
to be avoided. Coumarin derivatives (warfarin) were permitted as needed. 
CYP3A4 substrates: Nilotinib is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor in vivo. Drugs known to be sensitive 
substrates of CYP3A4 and drugs with narrow therapeutic indices were permitted with caution.  
Antacid drugs: Nilotinib has a pH-dependent solubility; therefore, in order not to impact nilotinib PK, 
H2 blocker (famotidine) was required to be administered approximately 10 hours before or 
approximately 2 hours after the nilotinib dose; antacid (e.g. hydroxide/magnesium 
hydroxide/simethicone) was required to be administered approximately 2 hours before or 
approximately 2 hours after the nilotinib dose.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  
The primary endpoint for cohorts 1 and 3 was major molecular response (MMR) defined as Fusion gene 
from breakpoint cluster region and Abelson genes ( BCR-ABL)/ABL % ≤ 0.1% by International scale 
(IS) as measured by RQ-PCR (Real-Time Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction), confirmed by 
duplicate analysis of the same sample.

Secondary endpoints: 
The list of secondary efficacy endpoints for study A2203 is displayed in Table 13. 
Table 13 List of secondary efficacy endpoints - Study A2203  
Sample size 
There was no formal power-based calculation done for this single-arm trial. A minimum of 50 patients 
(including a minimum of 15 newly diagnosed Ph+CML-CP patients and 15 Ph+CML-CP patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/54558/2018  
Page 40/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resistant or intolerant to either imatinib or dasatinib) were selected principally on the basis of 
operational and feasibility criteria, and in accordance with the minimal numbers required by the Health 
Authorities. 
Randomisation 
This was a single-arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The data from all centres within each patient cohort was pooled for analysis. Because no patients were 
enrolled in cohort 2 (Ph+ CML-AP patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib or dasatinib), analyses 
were only performed for cohorts 1 and 3. 
The primary efficacy endpoints were analysed descriptively for each cohort using the FAS, without 
hypothesis testing. Response rates were provided with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Clopper-
Pearson’s method by cohort. The secondary endpoints were also analysed descriptively using the FAS. 
The number and percentage of patients for each response category was provided at and by all 
scheduled time-points with available data. The cumulative response rates (i.e. by a time-point) as well 
as response rates at scheduled time-points were provided with 95% CIs using the Pearson-Clopper 
method. The cumulative incidence of response was graphically displayed by an increasing step-
function. BCR-ABL transcript levels were summarized as BCR-ABL transcript ratio (BCR-ABL/ABL) (%) 
by cohort by and at all time-points with available data. Summary statistics for time to first MMR, first 
CCyR, first MCyR and first CHR among patients who achieved MMR, CCyR, MCyR, CHR, respectively, 
were provided for responders only. Time to first response was also estimated and graphically displayed 
using the Kaplan Meier (K-M) method.

Table 14 Patient disposition by cohort (enrolled patients set) - Study A2203 
Recruitment 
Study A2203 was conducted in 36 centres across 13 countries (USA: 10, Japan: 5, France: 4; Italy: 4; 
Turkey: 1, Thailand: 3, UK: 2; Spain: 1, Republic of Korea: 2, Malaysia: 1, Hungary: 1, Netherlands: 
1, Russia: 1). 
The first patient was enrolled on 20 August 2013 and the study was closed to enrolment on 6 July 
2015, prior to the analysis cut-off date (1 June 2016 defined as the date by which all patients have 
completed 12 cycles of 28 days or discontinued study treatment early). Currently, the study is 
ongoing. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended four times.  
1) Amendment 1 (15-Sep-2014):  Main changes were: Following PDCO recommendation for the 
assessment of potential long-term safety and efficacy issues the study duration was extended from 24 
to 66 cycles 
• 
The primary efficacy endpoint was revised as recommended by the FDA. For Cohort 1, the 
“Rate of MCyR by 12 months” was revised to “Rate of MCyR at 6 cycles” and for Cohort 3, the “Rate of 
MCyR by 12 months” was revised to “Rate of CCyR at 12 cycles”. To add EFS as a new secondary 
endpoint, two sensitivity analyses for disease progression, collection of additional bio specimens from 
patients participating on the clinical trial for future research studies (Children’s Oncology Group’s sites

EMA/54558/2018  
Page 42/96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
only), pre- and post-dose ECG measurements throughout the study in order to provide additional 
safety information in regards to nilotinib’s effect on QT prolongation. 
2) Amendment 2 (4-May-2015): The main purpose of this amendment was to adjust the minimum 
total sample size, as well as the minimum sample size of the newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP (cohort 3), 
to reflect the agreements with the US FDA and the EMA PDCO and the updated feasibility assessment 
in view of the very low incidence of Ph+ CML in the paediatric population and the actual trial accrual 
rates, and to enable timely availability of information in this population. The original study enrollment 
target of 65 total patients of which at least 50 would be Ph+CML newly diagnosed was reduced to at 
least 50 patients in total with at least 15 newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP patients.   
3) Amendment 3 (8-Feb-2016): The primary endpoint for cohort 1 was revised to enable an 
assessment of the impact of therapy in patients with Ph+ CML-CP resistant or intolerant to either 
imatinib or dasatinib. The rationale for this change was that as part of routine study monitoring, it was 
observed that a significant number of patients enrolling in this cohort were already in MCyR or CCyR at 
baseline. This finding was also consistent with findings from a recently published study (Zwaan 2013). 
The protocol was additionally amended, to remove the binary endpoints related to CHR, MCyR and 
CCyR which were no longer appropriate measures to evaluate the therapeutic effect of nilotinib in this 
patient population. The determination of BCR-ABL molecular response was also clarified. 
4) Amendment 4 (18-Apr-2016): The primary purpose for the amendment was to include hepatitis B 
virus testing as one of the study procedures and to identify study patients who might be at risk of 
hepatitis B virus reactivation. No other changes in study conduct occurred. 
Changes in planned analysis 
The original statistical analysis plan (RAP Module 3 Detailed statistical methodology) (22- Nov-2013) 
was based on protocol version 3. Amendment 1 (30-Mar-2016) was created before the database lock 
for primary analysis (19-Jul-2016) mainly to reflect the changes in protocol amendments 1, 2 and 3.  
A RAP Module 3 Amendment 2 (13-Jul-2016) was created before the database lock for primary analysis 
(19-Jul-2016). This RAP amendment 2 included the following main modifications: 
• 
The growth data analyses were updated to use the references provided by the WHO. This 
change also impacted the vital signs analyses. 
• 
It was clarified that any dose decrease in ‘mg’ due to a change in body surface area was not to 
be considered as a dose decrease unless it affected the dose in ‘mg/m2’. 
Protocol deviations 
There was no protocol deviation leading to exclusion from the PPS.

Secondary endpoint: Duration of MMR 
There was no patient with confirmed loss of MMR by the time of data cut-off date (1 June 2016), out of 
the 19 patients who were in MMR on treatment. The KM estimate of median duration of first MMR was 
not assessable.  
Updated data (cut-off date 1 December 2016) representing additional 6 months of data showed that 
there were no additional patients gaining MMR.  
An exploratory analyses was conducted by the applicant using different baseline characteristics 
including age, gender, race, resistance vs. no resistance to prior TKI, priori TKI (imatinib vs. dasatinib 
vs. both), level of molecular/cytogenetic/hematological response (MMR vs. CCyR but not MMR vs. CHR 
but not CCyR vs. no CHR/missing response) at baseline before switch to nilotinib. The results are

discontinued the study to undergo bone marrow transplantation, and the 3 patients with missing 
cytogenetic data discontinued treatment. 
Secondary endpoint:  Time to disease progression 
By the data cut-off date, one imatinib resistant (A2203-3020-00005) progressed to AP/BC after 10.1 
months on treatment. The patient discontinued the study treatment and was being followed-up for 
survival at the time of data cut-off. The median time to disease progression was not reached. The K-M 
estimated rate of progressions at 12-months was 3.7% (95% CI: 0.5, 23.5) (data not shown).  
Secondary endpoints:  EFS and OS 
By the data cut-off date, one patient had an event and no death was reported in the study. The EFS 
and OS data are not mature yet.

Subgroup analysis for the primary endpoints 
The subgroup analyses by the age group category for the MMR rate (1 to <12 years: 66.7%, 95% CI: 
22.3, 95.7; ≥12 to <18 years: 63.2%, 95% CI: 38.4, 83.7) by 12 cycles as well as CCyR rate for the 
age group categories 1 to <12 years: 66.7% (95% CI: 22.3, 95.7); ≥12 to <18 years: 63.2% 
(95%CI: 38.4, 83.7) at 12 cycles were consistent across subgroups. 
At 12 cycles 16/25 (64%) patients had reached MMR and CCyR. Looking at efficacy based on age, 
there seem to be no major difference between age-groups 1-12 and 12-18. However, all patients in 
cohort 3 are or above ten years.

Secondary endpoint: Duration of complete cytogenetic response 
Of the 21 patients who achieved CCyR on treatment, one patient (A2203-2070-00003) had confirmed 
loss of CCyR. The patient was still on treatment at the time of data cut-off. Consequently, the median 
duration of first CCyR in the newly diagnosed patients was not estimable and the K-M estimated rate of 
patients in CCyR for duration of at least 6 months was 94.1% (95% CI: 65.0, 99.1) (data not shown). 
Other endpoints 
• 
Major cytogenetic response rate by time point 
By the data cut-off, the MCyR rate was 88%. The MCyR rates by 6 and 12 cycles were the same as 
overall MCyR rate.  
• 
Time to first major cytogenetic response 
The median time to first MCyR was 5.55 months (95%CI: 5.5, 5.6) in 22 patients who achieved MCyR. 
The K-M estimated rate of achieving MCyR was 91.7% (95% CI: 76.7, 98.6) at 6 months. 
• 
Complete haematological response by time point 
By the data cut-off, the CHR rate in the newly diagnosed patients was 92.0%. By 6 and 12 cycles the 
CHR rates were 84% and 92%, respectively. 
• 
Time to first complete haematological response 
The median time to first CHR in the newly diagnosed patients was 1 month (95% CI: 1.0, 2.8). The K-
M estimated rate of achieving CHR was 95.6% (95% CI: 81.6, 99.7) at 12 months 
• 
Duration of complete haematological response 
Of the 22 patients who achieved MCyR on treatment, one patient, who also had documented loss of 
CCyR) had confirmed loss of MCyR and the patient was still on treatment at the time of data cut-off. 
Consequently, the median duration of first MCyR was not estimable. The K-M estimate for the rate of 
patients in MCyR for duration of at least 12 months was 94.1% (95% CI: 65.0, 99.1).

• 
Time to disease progression 
By the data cut-off, one newly diagnosed patient temporarily matched the technical definition for 
progression to AP/BC, one month after the start of nilotinib, due to increased basophil cell count. The 
treatment had been temporarily interrupted for 13 days during the first 28 days cycle due to prolonged 
QT. The patient remained in the study, went back to CP one month after the progression and was in 
CHR and CCyR by 6 cycles of nilotinib treatment.  
• 
Event free survival 
By the data cut-off, two patients had an event: one patient had confirmed loss of MCyR; another 
patient was meeting the technical definition of disease progression . The estimated rate of EFS was 
90% (95%CI: 64.6, 97.5) at 12 months. 
• 
Overall survival 
By the data cut-off, no death was reported in the study.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Data  from  patients  with  Ph+  CML  in  studies  A2203  and  A2120  were  pooled  and  the  pooled  efficacy 
database  comprised  two  sets  of  patients,  drawn  from  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  of  the  respective 
studies: 
• 
Ph+ CML-CP resistant/intolerant to imatinib/dasatinib (N=44, including 33 patients from study 
A2203 and 11 patients from Study A2120), and 
•  Newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP (N=25, all from Study A2203)  
The following efficacy endpoints were analysed: 
•  Rate of MMR at and by all-time points 
• 
Time to MMR 
•  Duration of MMR 
•  BCR-ABL/ABL ratio (% International scale, IS) categories at and by all-time points.  
When  calculating  molecular  response,  only  results  based  on  blood  PCR  testing  according  to  classical 
criteria for MMR were considered for the pooled analyses.

None of the 21 resistant/intolerant patients, who were in MMR on treatment, had confirmed loss of 
MMR. Consequently, the median duration of first MMR was not reached in the resistant/intolerant 
patients (data not shown). 
Disease progression and OS 
No patient died or experienced disease progression in study A2120. No patient died in study A2203; 
however, two patients matched the technical definition of disease progression.

Clinical studies in special populations 
N/A 
Supportive study 
Study  A2120  is  a  PK/PD  study  that  also  included  efficacy  endpoints.  These  efficacy  data  have  been 
pooled and assessed above (see section ‘‘Analysis performed across trials’’).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has provided two clinical studies, studies A2203 and A2120, where study A2203, a phase 
II study, is considered the pivotal study, while study A2120 (a phase I PK/PD study) is considered a 
supportive in terms of efficacy and safety. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study A2203 was agreed with the PDCO and fulfils the PIP as required. Cohort 1 included patients with 
CML-CP resistant or intolerant to imatinib or dasatinib, cohort 2 planned to include patients with CML-
AP resistant or intolerant to imatinib or dasatinib, while cohort 3 included patients with newly-
diagnosed CML-CP in chronic phase. In total 58 patients were treated with nilotinib, however, no 
patients were enrolled in cohort 2 because the number of planned patients per cohort was not based 
on a formal sample size calculation, but on feasibility considerations given that CML is a rare disease, 
and in accordance with patient enrollment and regulatory agreements . This is overall acceptable due 
to the very rare incidence of CML in the paediatric population and seems to reflect probably the 
limitation of feasibility of clinical studies in this population. 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria clearly defined patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP or Ph+ CML-
CP or CML-AP resistant or intolerant to imatinib or dasatinib.  
The objectives of this study were clearly defined and in accordance with the PIP. The primary 
objectives were to assess the efficacy of nilotinib in paediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP resistant or 
intolerant to either imatinib or dasatinib, to assess the efficacy of nilotinib in paediatric patients with 
Ph+ CML-AP resistant or intolerant to either imatinib or dasatinib, and to assess the efficacy of nilotinib 
in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CMLCP. The secondary objectives were to further 
characterize efficacy, safety and PK/PD. The primary endpoints for the different cohorts were clearly 
defined. Rate of MMR is a clinically relevant and valid endpoint in these patient populations. Several 
supporting secondary endpoints, such as time to MMR, duration of MMR, BCR-ABL transcript levels, 
OS, etc., were also defined. These aim to further characterize and support the findings of the primary 
endpoint.  The primary and secondary endpoints were in line with the objectives of the study and are 
as such endorsed. 
With regard to conduct of the study, several amendments were installed during the study, however, 
none are considered critical. There were no protocol deviations. Median age was 13 years in both 
cohorts, ranging from 2 to 17 years in cohort 1 and 10-16 in cohort 3. The majority (63.6%) of the 
patients in cohort 1 were between 12-18 years, while all patients were above 10 in cohort 3. Most of 
the patients were Caucasian or Asian. Concerning baseline characteristics, median age was 13 years in 
both cohorts, ranging from 2 to 17 years in cohort 1 and 10-16 in cohort 3. As expected all patients in 
the Cohort 3 have a BCR-ABL ratio >10%, thus, none were in MMR at baseline. In comparison, 7 
Assessment report  
EMA/54558/2018  
Page 65/96 
 
 
 
 
 
patients were in MMR in cohort 1 at baseline.  Six (18.2%) patients were imatinib/dasatinib intolerant; 
however, they were all intolerant to imatinib. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Imatinib/dasatinib resistant  
Approximately 40% of the patients in cohort 1 were in MMR at 6 cycles, however, it should be noted 
that 6 out of 13 patients were already in MMR at baseline. Nonetheless, the results are encouraging, 
since treatment with nilotinib keeps these 6 patients in MMR and further patients are brought into 
MMR. As seen later, MMR by time point shows that 57.6% of the patients are in MMR by cycle 12. 
Although 14 patients did not obtain MMR, reflecting the resistant/refractory patient population, the 
observed results are nevertheless considered clinically highly relevant.  Median time to first MMR is 
2.79 months and by 12 months and onwards the MMR rate is 64.9%. Once a patient gained MMR they 
continued to stay in MMR by the time of data cut-off date. These clinically relevant findings support the 
primary endpoint. 
Not all patients obtained MMR, however, by cycle twelve 84.8% (28 patients) of the patients had 
obtained MCyR, and of these, 27 had a complete MCyR. Only one patient did not have a cytogenetic 
response. 
Newly diagnosed  
At 12 cycles 16/25 (64%) patients had reached MMR and CCyR. Looking at efficacy based on age, 
there seem to be no major difference between age-groups 1-12 and 12-18. However, all patients in 
cohort 3 are or above ten years. Although, the results are considered clinically relevant, there are no 
data for children below 10 year, and furthermore the PK/PD models only included resistant/refractory 
patients. Satisfactory support has been provided and the SmPC reflects the limited data. 
With regard to MMR by time point, 68% of the patients had gained MMR by cycle 12, while 68% had 
gained MMR by data cut-off. Thus, it seems as deep and prolonged responses are achieved in newly 
diagnosed patients treated with nilotinib. 
The CCyR rate was 84% by the time of data cut-off. Median time to first complete cytogenetic 
response was 5.55 months. The KM estimated rate of CCyR was 90.6% by 6 months. Only 1/21 had a 
loss of CCyR at the time of data cut-off.   
The above results are clinically relevant and in line with the observed effects of imatinib in newly 
diagnosed patients, where CHR rate of 78% after eight weeks of treatment and a CCyR rate of 65% 
were observed. Thus, the results available indicate efficacy also in newly diagnosed patients. However 
due to the limited observational period in trial A2203 the long-term efficacy will be provided post 
authorisation (see Annex II condition). 
Overall, the analyses of the pooled dataset of studies A2203 and A2120 show consistent results with 
the findings in study A2203. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, clinically relevant and meaningful results have been shown in resistant/refractory and newly 
diagnosed paediatric patients with Ph+ CML. However, due to the limited observational period in trial 
A2203 the CHMP requested the applicant to provide the final results of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/54558/2018  
Page 66/96 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The applicant should submit the final results of study CAMN107A2203, a phase II in paediatric patients 
with Ph+ CML CP resistant or intolerant to either imatinib or dasatinib and in newly diagnosed patients 
(see Annex II and RMP).  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety review is based on the pooled data from 73 paediatric patients treated with nilotinib 230 
mg/m2 bid in the two clinical studies A2203 and A2120. The pooled safety set included paediatric 
patients who received at least one dose of nilotinib in Study A2120 or Study A2203. Both studies 
(A2120 and A2203) contributed to the pooled safety data for patients with Ph+ CML-CP 
resistant/intolerant to either imatinib/dasatinib; however, only study A2203 enrolled newly diagnosed 
Ph+ CML-CP patients. Study A2120 also had enrolled four patients with refractory/relapsed Ph+ ALL, 
which are included in the pooled dataset (hereafter referred to as pooled patient population). 
•  Resistant/intolerant CML (44 patients) 
•  Newly diagnosed CML (25 patients) 
•  All CML (69 patients) 
•  All patients (CML and ALL) (73 patients) 
Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring the frequency, duration, and severity of adverse 
events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), and by evaluation of the laboratory data (haematology and 
clinical chemistry), as well as measurement of vital signs, description of physical examinations and 
assessment of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG). Growth data consisting of height, height velocity, 
weight, and weight velocity were also analysed. AEs and laboratory tests were assessed according to 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Different versions of CTCAE had been 
used for AE and laboratory value grading in the individual studies (v3.0 for Study A2120 and v4.03 for 
Study A2203). In the pooled dataset, laboratory values were re-classified by programming into 
Common Toxicology Criteria (CTC) grades according to the CTCAE version 4.03 for both trials, while 
CTC grading for AEs had to remain the one of the original stud y (as per the Investigator's 
assessment). AEs in the pooled dataset were coded/re-coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 19.0 available at the time of the database lock of Study A2203. 
In  addition  to  the  pooled  data,  the  following  safety  assessments  performed  only  in  Study  A2203  are 
also presented:

QT prolongation and sudden death 
No cases of torsade de pointes, or sudden death, were reported in Study A2203 or Study A2120. 
AESIs in the category QT prolongation (i.e., ECG QT prolonged, syncope) were reported in 13.0% of 
CML patients, with similar incidences in the resistant/intolerant (13.6%) and newly diagnosed (12.0%) 
populations. The events were SAEs in two patients (2.9%); in both patients the SAEs resolved 
following interruption of study drug, and the patients continued in the study. None of the events led to 
discontinuation of study drug. 
Based on evaluation of ECGs, none of the patients had QTcF value >500 ms, or an increase in QTcF 
>60 ms from baseline. QTcF value >480 ms was observed in 4.4% of CML patients. The patient with 
syncope who was reported in this AESI category had normal QTcF documented on the day of syncope. 
Cardiac and arterial vascular occlusive events 
AESIs in the category CVE were reported in a single patient. This was a case of angina pectoris 
reported in a newly diagnosed CML patient who was reported as having angina pectoris on one 
occasion after 2 hours of sport with rapid recovery after stopping his effort. Consultation with a 
cardiologist revealed no cardiac problems, normal ECG and echocardiography results, and a normal 
stress test that excluded cardiac pathology according to the cardiologist. 
No other cardiac or vascular occlusive events were reported, and no cases of cardiac failure were 
observed.  
Fluid retention 
AESIs in the category fluid retention (i.e. weight increased, eye swelling, and lip swelling) were 
reported in 7.2% of CML patients. These AEs were all grade 1-2, except for one patient with a grade 3 
AE of weight increase. 
None of the fluid retention events were SAEs, or led to discontinuation of study drug.

Growth 
At the time of data cut-off, the information collected on growth was considered to be of an insufficient 
duration to draw any conclusions. The standard deviation scores (SDS) for height, height velocity, 
body mass index, and weight velocity were comparable both prior to and after start of nilotinib 
treatment in both resistant/intolerant and newly diagnosed patient populations. At Cycle 24, the height 
velocity SDS appears to be lower than at Cycle 18, however the number of observations at Cycle 24 is 
small. These patients had essentially SDS score within the normal range at baseline and without any 
clear evidence of a negative pattern over time with the limitations of short follow up. The proportion of 
patients in resistant/intolerant and in newly diagnosed with SDS values <5th percentile or >95th 
percentile on height, height velocity, body mass index, and weight velocity did not increase 
significantly after the start of nilotinib.  
Bone biochemical markers 
The SDS for bone biochemical biomarkers (serum C-telopeptide and bone specific alkaline 
phosphatase) was comparable both prior to and after start of nilotinib treatment in both patient 
populations. The proportions of resistant/intolerant patients and newly diagnosed patients with serum 
C-telopeptide and bone specific alkaline phosphatase SDS values <3rd percentile or >97th percentile 
did not change significantly over the 12 cycles of nilotinib treatment.  
Sexual maturation 
The scope of conclusion regarding the indication of delayed puberty or a trend for puberty on nilotinib 
treatment was limited in this study considering the limited sample size and short duration of follow up 
at the time of the data cut-off. By the time of data cut-off, among patients at risk when starting 
nilotinib treatment, no patients (irrespective of gender) had delayed puberty. 
Overall, among patients in Tanner stage 1 at Baseline, Tanner stage 2 was attained in three out of 
eight male patient for genitalia, two out of five female patients for breast development and three out of 
nine female and two out of nine male patients for pubic hair. All patients who had not yet attained 
Tanner stage 2 at the time of the data cut-off date for genital development (male), breast 
development (female), or pubic hair (irrespective of gender) were <13 years of age at Baseline. 
Three out of nine pre-menarchial female patients at baseline experienced menarche by the data cut-
off. The median age for attaining menarche was 14.8 years. Puberty data including menarche status 
was not reported for one pre-menarchial patient. All the premenarchial female patients at baseline who 
did not experience menarche by the data cut-off were 10 years of age or less at baseline.

Five patients met the biochemical criteria for Hy’s law (i.e., concurrent ALT or AST >3xULN, bilirubin 
>2xULN, and ALP ≤ 2xULN), based on laboratory results. For one of the 5 patients who met the 
biochemical criteria for Hy’s law, confounding factors were present (ongoing hemolysis) that may 
provide an alternative explanation to the hepatic laboratory abnormalities. 
For the remaining 4 patients, chronic elevation of bilirubin and transaminases was present throughout 
the course of nilotinib therapy, and the technical definition of Hy's Law was met in 1 blood sample for 3 
patients, and in 2 blood samples for 1 patient. There were no obvious confounding factors. For one of 
the 4 patients DILI was reported as an AE. 
Pancreatitis and elevated serum lipase 
No AESIs of pancreatitis were reported. Elevations in lipase values were reported in 15.9% of CML 
patients, with 7.2% of patients having a grade 3-4 elevation based on laboratory results. A grade 4 
elevation was seen in a single patient; this patient had a concurrent AE of DILI. 
Electrolyte abnormalities 
The use of nilotinib has been associated with hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, 
hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia in adult patients. In the pediatric CML patients, the majority of newly 
occurring electrolyte abnormalities were grade 1-2. Grade 3-4 electrolyte abnormalities were seen in a 
small proportion of patients (decreased phosphate 1.4%, increased magnesium 2.9%, and decreased 
potassium 1.4%).  
Bone biochemical markers 
The SDS for bone biochemical biomarkers (CTX and bone specific ALP) was comparable prior to and 
after the first 12 cycles of nilotinib treatment in both patient populations. The proportion of patients in 
both patient populations with SDS values <3rd percentile or >97th percentile for CTX and bone specific 
ALP did not change significantly over time during the first 12 cycles of nilotinib. 
Special laboratory evaluations 
Thyroid function test (Study A2203 only) 
Imatinib/dasatinib resistant/intolerant CML-CP 
At baseline, 93.9% of 33 patients had a normal FT4 and 90.9% of patients had a normal TSH. One 
patient with a normal baseline TSH had a high TSH post-baseline and none had a low TSH. One patient 
with a normal baseline FT4 developed a low FT4 and one patient with a high FT4 at baseline had a 
normal post-baseline value. 
Newly diagnosed CML-CP 
At Baseline, 92.0% of 25 patients had normal TSH and 88.0% of patients had normal FT4. Two 
patients with a normal TSH at baseline developed a high TSH and two patients with a high TSH at 
Baseline had a normal TSH post baseline. One patient with a normal Baseline FT4 developed a high 
FT4 and one patient with a high FT4 at Baseline had a normal post baseline value.

Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
Age 
In patients with Ph+ CML-CP, a total of 24 patients were aged 2 to <12 years and 45 patients were 
aged 12 to <18 years. The median time on nilotinib treatment in the age group of 2 to <12 years was 
11.10 months (range: 2.4 to 26.0 months) and 14.55 months (range: 0.7 to 30.9 months) in the age 
group of 12 to <18 years. The median relative dose intensity of nilotinib in the age groups of 2 to <12 
years and 12 to <18 years was 98.9% (57.0 to 112.0%) and 91.5% (32.0 to 105.0%), respectively. 
Gender 
In patients with Ph+ CML-CP, a total of 40 patients were males and 29 patients were females. The 
median time on nilotinib treatment in males was 13.82 months (range: 3.7 to 30.9 months) and 13.63 
months (range: 0.7 to 27.6 months) in females. The median relative dose intensity of nilotinib in males 
was 93.7% (44.0 to 112.0%) and 95.4% (32.0 to 106.0%) in females. 
Race 
In patients with Ph+ CML-CP, a total of 39 patients were Caucasian and 24 patients were Asian. The 
median time on nilotinib treatment in Caucasians was 11.30 months (range: 1.4 to 30.9 months) and 
19.32 months (range: 0.7 to 27.7 months) in Asians. The median relative dose intensity of nilotinib in 
Caucasians was 94.7% (32.0 to 112.0%) and 95.1% (42.0 to 106.0%) in Asians. 
Vitals and ECG 
In patients with Ph+ CML-CP, no clinically relevant difference was observed in the overall frequency of 
post-baseline vital sign parameters/weight abnormalities across the subgroups. 
Table 52 Vital signs/weight abnormalities (safety set) 
Electrocardiogram 
1. By age and gender, no clinically relevant difference was observed in the frequency of notable QTcF 
interval changes at post-baseline across the subgroups. 
2. By race, the frequency of QTcF increase of >30 ms was higher in Caucasians (28.9% vs. 16.7% in 
Asians), although no relevant difference was observed in the incidence of new QTcF >450 ms between 
the subgroups.

Among 22 (30.1%) patients who discontinued treatment, the most frequent primary reasons for 
treatment discontinuation were AEs (10 [13.7%] patients) and new cancer therapy (6 [8.2%] 
patients).  
In the pooled patient population (all Ph+ CML-CP), the most frequent AEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation (≥ two patients) were blood bilirubin increased, hyperbilirubinaemia, and rash (two 
patients, each). Blood bilirubin increased (reported in two patients) leading to study drug 
discontinuation was reported in one patient. Similar adverse events were also responsible for dose 
reductions and interruptions. 
Nine patients in the Ph+ CML population discontinued treatment during the trials. Reasons for 
discontinuation were liver enzyme increase, rash, and GI related events. 
Post marketing experience 
The results of the literature review did not reveal any important articles. There were no new or 
significant safety findings related to Tasigna published in the peer-reviewed scientific or made available 
as unpublished manuscripts during the reporting interval. 
No new relevant safety data of significant impact were received from post-marketing surveillance 
during the recent PSUR reporting period. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Applicant has pooled safety data from studies A2203 and A2120 which is endorsed. Furthermore, 
safety assessments on growth, development and maturation are also provided. Mean and median time 
on treatment is 14.94 and 12.45 months respectively in cohort 1, while 15.20 and 14.55 months 
respectively in cohort 3. The general exposure is relatively short as indicated by a mean and median 
time on treatment of 14.94 and 12.45 months respectively in cohort 1 and 15.20 and 14.55 months 
respectively in cohort 3. However, as the number of patients treated for more than 18 months is about 
40% long-term experience in children can be seen as sufficient taking the available experience in 
adults into account. 
All patients experienced AEs, and the majority of these AEs were suspected to be related to nilotinib by 
the investigators. However, only few AEs led to discontinuation, while a considerable large number of 
AEs were managed by dose adjustments. The majority of AEs were clinically manageable, but requiring 
Assessment report  
EMA/54558/2018

additional therapy. There was no Grade 5 AE, while the number of Grade 3-4 AEs was 43.2% and 64% 
in cohort 1 and 3 respectively. 
The most common AEs were related to skin/subcutaneous tissue disorders, infections, GI disorders, 
investigations, nervous system, respiratory and musculoskeletal disorders. More specifically, the most 
common AEs were headache, rash, liver enzyme increase, pyrexia, nausea, upper respiratory infection, 
vomiting, and pain. Overall, the most commonly observed AEs in the paediatric population are similar 
to the observed safety profile of nilotinib in the adult population.  
With regard to AESI, they were clinically manageable. A part of the paediatric population (5/77) had 
chronic elevation of bilirubin and transaminases which met the biochemical criteria for Hy’s law 
(technical definition met in one blood sample for 4 patients and in 2 separate blood samples for 1 
patient). For one of the patients confounding factors were present, and the 4 remaining patients were 
effectively managed with close monitoring, and dose modification or interruptions.  
Considering growth and sexual maturation, the duration of the follow-up is considered limited, due to 
the relative short follow-up. Impact of nilotinib on growth and sexual maturation cannot be assessed at 
present and updated information will be needed during these procedures as well as during the next 
years. As only 2 children below the age of 5 are included it seems rather unlikely that full clarification 
of this issue can be expected from the ongoing clinical trial. However, due to the rareness of the 
disease in the paediatric population the difficulties in elaborating this information are acknowledged. In 
total 10 patients (8 (18.2%) patients in cohort 1 and 2(8.0%) patients in cohort 3) experienced SAEs. 
The SAE are mostly related to GI. There were no new safety findings in these paediatric studies. All 
SAEs resolved, except for one patient. This patient developed growth hormone deficiency during the 
study, however, there are uncertainties related to this event. Slower growth was documented in this 
patient prior to treatment with nilotinib. Thus, this SAE cannot with certainty be related to nilotinib. 
With regard to laboratory findings, as expected the majority of the patients experienced 
haematological abnormalities. Most common AEs were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia. 
Nilotinib is known for its myelosuppressive effects. This clearly reflected in the SmPC and these AEs 
are clinically manageable, and only few patients had to discontinue treatment.   
In paediatric patients, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions observed have been 
generally consistent with those observed in adults, with the exception of the laboratory abnormalities 
hyperbilirubinaemia (Grade 3/4: 13.0%) and transaminase elevation (AST Grade 3/4: 1.4%, ALT 
Grade 3/4: 8.7%) which were reported at a higher frequency than in adult patients. Bilirubin and 
hepatic transaminase levels should be monitored during treatment (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Laboratory abnormalities of mild to moderate transient elevations of aminotransferases and total 
bilirubin have been observed in children at a higher frequency than in adults, indicating a higher risk of 
hepatotoxicity in the paediatric population. Liver function (bilirubin and hepatic transaminases levels) 
should be monitored monthly or as clinically indicated. Elevations of bilirubin and hepatic 
transaminases should be managed by withholding nilotinib temporarily, dose reduction and/or 
discontinuation of nilotinib. The long-term effects of prolonged treatment with nilotinib in children and 
adolescents are unknown (SmPC, sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
No clinically significant ECG abnormalities were reported; there were no patients with QTcF 
prolongation >500 mg, or >60 ms prolonged from baseline. No cases of torsade de pointes were 
reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/54558/2018  
Page 82/96 
 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup analyses for demographic factors (age group, gender, and race) did not reveal any 
consistent differences in safety findings; however, due to the low number of patients in these 
subgroups, the results must be interpreted with caution. 
Currently, there is limited information regarding the side effects of nilotinib in paediatric patients 
treated for duration longer than 18 months.  Although data on growth and development was collected 
in Study A2203, the duration of follow-up at the time of the 18-month data cut-off is too short to allow 
any definite conclusions to be drawn. The final report of study A2203 will be submitted post 
authorisation. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Safety results in paediatric patients treated with nilotinib were in general consistent with the known 
safety profile of nilotinib in adults with the exception of a more pronounced hepatotoxicity which was 
observed in the paediatric population. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
- The final report of study A2203 will be submitted post authorisation (see Annex II and RMP).

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 20.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated.  The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the MAH introduced 50 mg strength with subsequent changes to the Product Information. 
In addition the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to include some editorial 
changes and to bring the product information in line with the latest QRD template version 10. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
With this application, a separate Package Leaflet for Tasigna 50 mg hard capsules is introduced which 
is based on the approved Package Leaflet for Tasigna 200 mg hard capsules. No significant changes 
are introduced in the currently approved text of the Tasigna Package Leaflets. In particular, the key 
information in the Tasigna Package Leaflets remains unchanged and the changes to the Package 
Leaflets are limited. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
This application refers to the paediatric use in the indications of newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase and in Philadelphia 
chromosome positive CML in chronic phase with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including 
imatinib.

3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Prior to the availability of imatinib, IFN-α was the treatment of choice for adult and paediatric patients 
not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), with patients who achieved complete 
cytogenetic response on IFN surviving more than a decade.  However, only a small proportion (5–
10%) of patients responds to IFN. Imatinib (first approved for the use in children in 2001) has now 
become the standard first-line treatment in paediatric patients.  
Imatinib has reduced the yearly risk of progression from CP to advanced stages to less than 1% per 
year. In a study conducted in 51 paediatric patients with de novo CML-CP, the CCyR rate was 64.7%, 
and the MMR rate was 27.3% (Champagne et al 2011). Similar results were reported in a study 
conducted in 44 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, with CCyR and MMR rates of 61% 
and 31%, respectively, at 12 months. 
However, imatinib and second generation TKIs seem not curing the disease and in the majority of 
patients leukemic cells will persist; furthermore not all patients respond to, or tolerate imatinib as first 
line treatment. Some patients who initially respond to imatinib subsequently relapse, usually due to 
the emergence of mutations in BCR-ABL that confer resistance to imatinib, or due to overexpression of 
the BCR-ABL protein. 
An unmet medical need exists for alternative, more effective treatment options in paediatric patients 
with CML. Considering that imatinib is currently the only approved BCR-ABL-targeted TKI in paediatric 
patients with CML-CP, other therapeutic alternatives particularly in children in whom resistance or 
intolerance to imatinib develops, is needed.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study CAMN107A2203 was a Phase II, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid conducted in 58 paediatric patients with Ph+ CML (33 
were resistant or intolerant to imatinib or dasatinib (Cohort 1), and 25 were newly diagnosed (cohort 
3)).  
Additionally, study CAMN107A2120 was a Phase I, open-label, multi-center study that evaluated the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and preliminary efficacy of nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid in paediatric 
patients with Ph+ CML resistant or intolerant to imatinib or dasatinib (N=11) or refractory/relapsed 
Ph+ acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL; N=4). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Imatinib/dasatinib resistant  
Approximately 40% of the patients in cohort 1 were in MMR at 6 cycles, however, it should be noted 
that 6 out of 13 patients were already in MMR at baseline. Median time to first MMR is 2.79 months 
and by 12 months and onwards the MMR rate is 64.9%. Once a patient gained MMR they continued to 
stay in MMR by the time of data cut-off date.  
Assessment report  
EMA/54558/2018  
Page 89/96 
 
 
 
 
 
Not all patient obtained MMR, however, by cycle twelve 84.8% (28 patients) of the patients had 
obtained MCyR, and of these, 27 had a complete MCyR. Only one patient did not have a cytogenetic 
response.  
Newly diagnosed  
At 12 cycles 16/25 (64%) patients had reached MMR and CCyR. With regard to MMR by time point, 
64% of the patients had gained MMR by cycle 12, while 68% had gained MMR by data cut-off. Only 
1/17 patients lost MMR by data cut-off. The CCyR rate was 84% by the time of data cut-off. Median 
time to first complete cytogenetic response was 5.55 months. The KM estimated rate of CCyR was 
90.6% by 6 months. Only 1/21 had a loss of CCyR at the time of data cut-off. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No data are available in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase below the age 
of 10 years and there are limited data in paediatric CML-CP patients below 6 years of age in the 
resistant/refractory setting. Taking into account the rareness of the disease, it is considered acceptable 
that the clinical pharmacology data and the data provided from the literature support the conclusion 
that nilotinib at the dose of 230 mg/m2 BID is efficacious and safe in newly diagnosed and 
resistant/intolerant CML-CP patients from 2 to 18 years of age. The product information has been 
updated to reflect it. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
There was no Grade 5 AE, while the number of Grade 3-4 AEs was 43.2% and 64% in cohort 1 and 3 
respectively. 
The most common AEs were related to skin/subcutaneous tissue disorders, infections, GI disorders, 
investigations, nervous system, respiratory and musculoskeletal disorders. More specifically, the most 
common AEs were headache, rash, liver enzyme increase, pyrexia, nausea, upper respiratory infection, 
vomiting, and pain. Overall, the most commonly observed AEs in the paediatric population are similar 
to the observed safety profile of nilotinib in the adult population. 
In total 10 patients (8 (18.2%) patients in cohort 1 and 2(8.0%) patients in cohort 3) experienced 
SAEs. The SAE are mostly related to GI.  
With regard to laboratory findings, as expected the majority of the patients experienced 
haematological abnormalities. Most common AEs were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia. 
Nilotinib is known for its myelosuppressive effects. The type and severity of AEs in paediatric patients 
were generally similar to those seen in adults.  
Hepatotoxicity as reflected in rates of increased ALT, AST, and bilirubin is significantly more frequent in 
the paediatric patients compared with that reported in adults. This is clearly reflected in the SmPC, 
section 4.4. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Currently, there is limited information regarding the side effects of nilotinib in paediatric patients 
treated for duration longer than 18 months.  Although data on growth and development was collected 
in Study A2203, the duration of follow-up at the time of the 18-month data cut-off is too short to allow 
Assessment report

any definite conclusions to be drawn. The final report of study A2203 will be submitted post 
authorisation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In imatinib/dasatinib resistant paediatric population, approximately 40% of the patients in cohort 1 
were in MMR at 6 cycles, however, it should be noted that 6 out of 13 patients were already in MMR at 
baseline. Nonetheless, the results are encouraging, since treatment with nilotinib keeps these 6 
patients in MMR and further patients are brought into MMR. Although 14 patients did not obtain MMR, 
reflecting the resistant/refractory patient population, the observed results are nevertheless considered 
clinically highly relevant.  Regarding secondary endpoints, median time to first MMR was 2.79 months 
and by 18 months and onwards the MMR rate was 64.9%. Once a patient gained MMR they continued 
to stay in MMR by the time of data cut-off date. These clinically relevant findings support the primary 
endpoint.

In newly diagnosed paediatric patients, 68% of them had gained MMR by cycle 18, while 68% had 
gained MMR by data cut-off. Only 1/17 patients lost MMR by data cut-off. Therefore, deep and 
prolonged responses are achieved in newly diagnosed patients treated with nilotinib. 
Overall, clinically relevant and meaningful results have been shown in resistant/refractory and newly 
diagnosed paediatric patients with Ph+ CML.  
With regard to AEs, the safety profile of nilotinib in a paediatric population is similar that observed in 
an adult population. There were no new safety findings. The majority of AEs were clinically 
manageable. However, as for a life-long treatment, particularly long-term safety risks have to be 
carefully considered, patients in newly diagnosed PH+CML-CP should receive the drug with the lowest 
safety risk, while in patients with no treatment alternatives, e.g. those in second or later line, the 
benefit of TKI-treatment in CML will outweigh also higher toxicities.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall benefit-risk balance of nilotinib administered at 230 mg/m2 bid in paediatric patients with 
CML-CP resistant/intolerant to prior TKI (including imatinib) and in newly diagnosed CML-CP is positive. 
Due to the lack of treatment alternatives, the safety risks are outweighed by the observed efficacy. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tasigna is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Tasigna is not similar to Sprycel (dasatinib), Bosulif 
(bosutinib) and Iclusig (ponatinib) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/200. See Appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Tasigna 50 mg hard capsules is favourable in the following indications: 
Tasigna is indicated for the treatment of: 
-  adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic 
myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase, 
-  adult patients with chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML 
with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. Efficacy data in patients with 
CML in blast crisis are not available, 
Assessment report  
EMA/54558/2018  
Page 92/96 
 
 
 
 
 
-  paediatric patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with resistance or 
intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Tasigna subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to investigate the efficacy of 
nilotinib in paediatric patients with Ph+ CML CP resistant or intolerant to either 
imatinib or dasatinib and in newly diagnosed patients the MAH should submit the 
final results of the phase II CAMN107A2203 study.  
Due date 
Final CSR: April 
2021 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation(s) to the terms of the marketing authorisation, 
concerning the following change(s):

Extension of Indication to include treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP), or with Ph+ 
CML-CP resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib, based on results from two clinical 
studies in paediatric patients conducted in accordance with the approved Tasigna Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP); the Phase I PK study CAMN107A2120 and the Phase II safety and efficacy 
study CAMN107A2203. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
Assessment report

been updated and Annex II and the package leaflet have been updated accordingly. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial changes and to align the annexes with the 
latest QRD template. An updated RMP version 20.0 was agreed during the procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the RMP. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0297/2015 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  NovoNorm.  This 
scientific discussion has been updated until 1 February 2001. For information on changes after 
this date please refer to module 8B. 
1. 
Introduction 
NovoNorm  contains  Repaglinide.  Repaglinide  is  a  carbamoylmethyl  benzoic  acid  derivative 
insulinotropic  agent,  intended  for  use  in  the  treatment  of  NIDDM  (Non-Insulin-Dependent  Diabetes 
Mellitus).  
Existing  treatment  of  NIDDM  aims  to  increase  glucose  disposal  via  improving  glucose  sensitivity 
(metformin),  reducing  glucose  uptake  (acarbose),  improving  insulin  sensitivity  (rosiglitazone, 
pioglitazone),  substituting  insulin  (insulin  injections)  or  inducing  insulin  secretion  (sulphonylureas). 
Similar  to  the  latter  group,  repaglinide  lowers  the  blood  glucose  levels  acutely  by  stimulating  the 
release  of  insulin  from  the  pancreas.  Repaglinide  is  structurally  unrelated  to  sulfonylureas  (such  as 
glibenclamide) and the molecular mechanism of induction of insulin release is different.   
The approved indication is for the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes (Non-Insulin-Dependent 
Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM)) whose hyperglycaemia can no longer be controlled satisfactorily by diet, 
weight reduction and exercise. Repaglinide is also indicated in combination with metformin in Type 2 
diabetes  patients  who  are  not  satisfactorily  controlled  on  metformin  alone.  Treatment  should  be 
initiated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to lower the blood glucose in relation to meals. 
The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg. One or two weeks should elapse between titration steps as 
determined  by  blood  glucose  response.  The  recommend  maximum  single  dose  is  4  mg  taken  with 
main meals. The total maximum daily dose should not exceed 16 mg.

Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
NovoNorm  is  presented  as  an  immediate  release,  conventional  tablet  formulation.  Standard 
pharmacopoeial-grade  excipients  are  used  where  appropriate,  in  order  to  optimise  the  stability  and 
release  of  the  active  substance.  A  blend  of  standard  excipients  such  as  disintegrants,  lubricants  etc. 
ensures that the disintegration of the tablet is rapid and subsequent dissolution of the active substance 
is also rapid and uniform. A number of formulations have been developed and used in clinical trials 
during  the  history  of  the  product,  although  these  have  been  shown  to  be  bioequivalent  in  crossover 
studies in humans. 
As  applied  for,  the  marketing  application  is  for  three  strengths  (0.5  mg,  1.0  mg  and  2.0  mg).  The 
0.5 mg tablets are white, the 1.0 mg tablets are yellow and the 2.0 mg tablets are peach-coloured. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  remained  essentially  unchanged  during  development  and  involves  a 
spray-drying granulation process for optimum distribution of the active substance in the matrix of the 
tablet. 
Active substance 
Repaglinide  is  a  new  chemical  entity  with  a  non-sulphonylurea  structure.  It  is  a  chiral  molecule 
synthesised essentially as the S(+)-isomer, with traces of the R(-)-isomer present as an impurity. This 
selective synthesis has been developed on the grounds that the S(+)-isomer is approximately 100-fold 
more  potent  than  the  R(-)-enantiomer  in  the  rat.  The  synthesis  involves  two  parallel  pathways  that 
have been adequately described. 
The active substance exists in different polymorphic forms, although this is without relevance for the 
drug product as repaglinide is dissolved during the manufacture of the product. Similarly, the particle 
size distribution of the drug substance is of no concern in this case. 
Generally, the active substance specification has been justified and is considered to provide adequate 
control  of  the  drug  substance  with  regard  to  safety  (impurity  levels)  and  bioavailablility.  The  batch 
analytical data presented confirm reproducible and consistent synthesis, and the data are in agreement 
1/11  
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with  the  proposed  specification.  Control  methods  have  been  adequately  described  and  are  generally 
well validated.  
Stability data support the retest period of the active substance that is 5 years. 
Other ingredients 
The excipients are well established as suitable for use in pharmaceutical products and are described in 
Pharmacopoeias.  
The packaging proposed for marketing, Al/Al/PVC-blister and HDP containers with PP screw cap, is 
adequate.  The  package  form  is  chosen  on  the  basis  of  the  sensitivity  of  the  tablets  to  high  relative 
humidity. Compatibility of  packaging  and formulation is further established  by the relevant  stability 
studies. 
Product development and finished product 
The manufacturing process for the three strengths of repaglinide tablets is very similar. The major step 
in the manufacturing process of the tablets is the formulation of spray dried granules. Equipment and 
manufacturing  process  are  adequately  described.  Process  validation  was  adequately  presented  in  the 
dossier and indicates that the manufacturing process is under control. 
Satisfactory batch release and shelf life specifications have been proposed and justified. 
Tests  at  release  are  standard  and  include  limits  for  assay,  related  impurities  (including  enantiomer), 
disintegration, dissolution, uniformity  of content etc. These tests  and limits  should  ensure  consistent 
clinical performance of the product. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  have been  performed  under  stressed, accelerated and  ambient long term  conditions, 
according  to  current  ICH  recommendations.  Analysis  has  been  performed  by  validated  stability-
indicating  methods  and  has  focussed  on  chiral  aspects  of  the  degradation  process  (racemisation)  as 
well as degradation in general and changes in disintegration/dissolution. 
The results of these studies were analysed and in general they confirm the suitability of the packaging 
material and the shelf-life and storage conditions as proposed in the SPC (see sections 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 
of the SPC) 
3. 
Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  antihyperglycemic  activity  of  repaglinide  has  been  adequately  studied  in  rats  and  dogs. 
Comparative  studies  were  performed  with  glibenclamide.  Repaglinide  was  found  to  have  a  potent 
blood  sugar  lowering  effect  with  an  oral  ED50  of  about  0.01  mg/kg.  The  racemate  was  2-fold  less 
active  and  the  other  enantiomer  was  100-fold  less  active  than  repaglinide.  At  equimolar  doses 
repaglinide is 5-15 times (depending on the used model) more potent than glibenclamide in reducing 
glucose levels. Metabolite M-12 has at relevant doses (0.03-1.0mg/kg) similar hypoglycemic activity 
as the parent compound with exception for a delayed onset of action at lower doses.  
From  various  pre-clinical  studies  it  can  be  concluded  that  it  is  unlikely  that  repaglinide  at  clinically 
relevant doses has effects on the nervous, gastro-intestinal and respiratory system.  
With regard to the cardiovascular system, repaglinide showed substantial and not explainable species 
differences. In rats repaglinide increased blood pressure, whereas, after comparable doses in rabbits, a 
decrease in blood pressure was observed. An effect on blood pressure occurs at a dose about 100 times 
the dose that causes a hypoglycaemic effect. In rabbits no effects on the ECG were noted. In isolated 
single guinea pig ventricular myocytes using the patch clamp technique, repaglinide (1 and 10µmol/l) 
shortened the action potential at 90% of repolarisation. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Repaglinide  was  rapidly  absorbed  after  oral  administration  in  rats.  The  absolute  bioavailability  of  1 
mg/kg repaglinide in rats and dogs ranged from 48% to 73%. The absolute bioavailability in man was 
63%.  
2/11  
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
The calculated ratio AUC  animal/human was 19 and 22 for males and females, respectively and the 
safety margins are considered sufficient. Protein binding was high (96-98.6%). Studies on distribution 
of  repaglinide  and  its  metabolites  in  rats  indicated  rapid  and  wide  distribution  to  various  tissues, 
including  brain.  The  highest  concentrations  of  repaglinide  and  its  metabolites  are  found  in  the  liver 
and gastrointestinal tract, which is consistent with metabolism and high faecal elimination.  
Human metabolism is similar to that in animals. There was, however, one metabolite in humans that 
could  not  be  fully  assessed  pre-clinically  because  of  low  amounts  being  formed  in  animals.  This 
metabolite  identified  as  M10  is  found  in  human  urine  and  plasma  at  low  concentrations  (2%  of 
administered dose)and therefore it is unlikely to represent a potential safety concern in humans. 
Toxicology 
The  main  findings  in  the  toxicology  studies  were  liver  enlargement  in  the  dog  study  at  dosage 
resulting in plasma concentrations of 600 times human Cmax. In addition, increased testes weight in the 
carcinogenicity  study  was  observed  at  dose  levels  resulting  in  exposure  levels  of  >30  times  human 
maximum  therapeutic  response  exposure  levels  (HMTL).  The  majority  of  effects  seen  in  the 
experimental animals might be attributed to the pharmacodynamic effect of repaglinide.  
Tumourigenic findings might be considered to be of epigenetic origin and/or species specific (thyroid 
findings).  As  these  lesions  could  only  be  observed  at  dose  levels  corresponding  to  exposure  levels 
>30 times HMTL the findings are considered to pose no risk for humans. As no other major adverse 
effects  are  observed  at  dose  levels  corresponding  to  exposure  levels  prominently  higher  than  the 
HMTL or human Cmax-values, margins of safety may be regarded to be adequate. 
4. 
Clinical aspects 
Clinical Pharmacology 
A total of 61 studies were performed, 45 clinical pharmacology studies and 16 clinical trials.  
A total of 2156 patients were exposed to repaglinide in all trials combined. In the assessment it was 
noted that there were nine adequate, well-controlled trials comprising 1563 patients.  
In the adequate and well-controlled studies, 399 patients >65 years received the drug at any dose and 
343 of these patients were exposed in the long-term controlled studies.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Repaglinide lowers blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas.  
In  NIDDM  patients  dose-escalating  studies  established  a  clinically  significant  dose  response  in  the 
range from 0.5  mg to 4 mg  given three times preprandially. In one double-blind,  placebo controlled 
study recruiting 24 patients over 5 days treatment, the 0.25mg did not significantly (i.e. significance 
was  defined  as  at  least  a  15%  reduction  in  glucose  AUC  (0-24h))  change  blood  glucose  levels  but 
achieved a mean reduction of 12.5%.  
Further studies suggested that repaglinide should be taken two to four times a day in connection with 
meals.  One  study  suggested  insufficient  overall  glycaemic  control  when  two  doses  were  combined 
with three meals.  
Dose-tolerability data derived from 3 pharmacodynamic studies (62 diabetic patients) with doses up to 
20 mg, 4 times daily revealed headache (14 patients) and gastro-intestinal (90 patients) events as the 
most  frequent  complaints.  One  patient  had  abnormal  ECG  results  (non-specific  ST-T  changes)  but 
there were no episodes of hypoglycaemia or serious events.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Repaglinide is rapidly absorbed (tmax 0.9-1.4h; t1/2 0.6-1.4h) with an absolute bioavailability of 67.5 +/-
23.5%.  Repaglinide  is  almost  completely  metabolised  to  oxidative  metabolites  and/or  glucuronide 
conjugates.  The  elimination  half-life  is  about  1  h.  Metabolites  are  mainly  excreted  by  faeces  (90%) 
and to a lesser extent by urine (8%). Repaglinide did not accumulate after dose regimens of three or 
four times a day. Plasma concentrations of repaglinide are dose-proportional within the range of 0.125 
to 20 mg three or four times daily. A very high inter-individual variability is seen in plasma levels of 
repaglinide,  whereas  intra-individual  variability  was  low  to  moderate.  The  cause  for  the  high  inter-
3/11  
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
individual  variability  is  not  known  and  is  reflected  in  the  pharmacodynamic  effects  so  that  for  a 
patient who has a high repaglinide AUC, efficacy is reached at a lower dose. In addition, the results of 
the maximum tolerated-dose trial showed that the safety margin for repaglinide was large. 
Pharmacokinetics were evaluated in patients with mild/moderate and severely impaired renal function 
and  on  haemodialysis  as  well  as  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment.  These  studies  indicated  that 
repaglinide  exposure  is  increased  in  patients  with  hepatic  insufficiency  (see  section  5.2  of  the  SPC, 
“Pharmacokinetic properties”). The mean AUC levels and SD - as investigated in 24 patients were: 92 
+/-67 (12 healthy patients), 311 +/-160 (9 class B patients = moderate impairment) and 543 (3 class C 
patients  =  severe  impairment).  After  a  5  day  treatment  of  repaglinide  (2  mg,  three  times  a  day)  in 
patients with a severe impaired renal function (creatinine clearance: 20-39 ml/min), the results showed 
a significant 2-fold increase of the exposure (AUC) and half-life as compared to subjects with normal 
renal  function  (see  section  5.2  of  the  SPC,  “Pharmacokinetic  properties”).In  healthy  elderly  (>65 
years) individuals, the pharmacokinetics were comparable to those in young subjects although higher 
exposure pertained to elderly patients with Type 2 diabetes versus healthy elderly, i.e. AUC at day 9 
were 87 (34-110) and 231 (14-973) in healthy elderly and elderly with Type 2 diabetes. It could not be 
determined whether higher mean values in elderly are due to age, illness or the large interindividual 
variability.  
There were no trials performed in children or adolescents <18 years of age or in elderly >75 years of 
age. 
Interaction studies 
Repaglinide, the active compound of NovoNorm, is extensively metabolised. In vitro studies showed 
that  the  cytochrome  P450  iso-enzyme  3A4  is  solely  responsible  for  the  oxidative  metabolism  of 
repaglinide.  The  involvement  of  CYP  3A4  in  repaglinide  biotrasformation  was  investigated  in  five 
clinical trials in healthy subjects. These five interaction studies were performed with compounds, that 
are substrates, inducers of inhibitors of CYP 3A4 in order to elucidate the role of this iso-enzym in the 
pharmacokinetics of repaglinide. The results of these studies demonstrate that inducers, inhibitors or 
substrates  of  CYP  3A4  iso-enzymes  do  not  influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of  repaglinide  to  a 
clinically  relevant  extent.  Also,  the  concomitant  administration  of  repaglinide  did  not  change  the 
pharmakokinetics  of  ethinylestradiol  and  nifedipine,  two  compounds  predominately  metabolised  by 
CYP 3A4. However there is some influence on the Cmax of simvastatin and rifampicin (see section 
4.5 of the SPC, “Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction”).  
The pharmacokinetic interaction data described in the SPC were substantiated in 4 interaction studies 
performed in healthy volunteers receiving 2 mg repaglinide three times a day. 
Clinical efficacy 
In the well-controlled studies, Type 2 diabetic patients were treated by diet and/or oral hypoglycaemic 
agents.  Treatment  with  insulin  was  an  exclusion  criterion.  The  dosage  was  generally  0.5  to  4  mg  3 
times daily. In the two placebo controlled studies dosages from 0.25 to 8 mg 3 times daily were used. 
Three sulphonylureas were used as comparators: glibenclamide, gliclazide and glipzide. In one study 
the  effect  of  adding  repaglinide  to  metformin  was  investigated.Change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  and 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were the main efficacy endpoints. The effects of a number of baseline 
covariates, such as previous antidiabetic treatment, HbA1c and Body Mass Index at baseline, duration 
of  diabetes,  fasting  C-peptide,  HbA1c  at  baseline  by  previous  oral  hypoglycaemic  agents,  were 
analysed. 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  change  from  baseline  to  the  last  visit  (ITT  and  last  observation 
carried forward). In the equivalence trials the criterion for non-inferiority was that the upper limit for 
the 95% confidence interval for the difference (repaglinide-active comparator) in mean HbA1c was less 
than 0.6% units.  
The  five  long-term  protocols  were  identical  in  design,  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  titration 
procedures,  and  primary  efficacy  and  safety  variables.  In  order  to  collect  more  safety  data  on 
repaglinide, the randomisation was 2:1 (repaglinide:comparator). All patients were switched from their 
previous  treatment  to  the  test  compound  with  no  washout  period.  They  were  treated  in  an  8-week 
titration period followed by a 12-month maintenance period. All studies were performed according to 
Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki with local Ethics Committee approval.

Dose-response studies and Main Clinical Studies 
Placebo-controlled studies 
Dose titration followed by a three-month maintenance period was performed in a parallel, double blind 
trial in 99 Type 2 diabetic patients. HbA1c increased significantly in the placebo group (+1.1%), and 
decreased  significantly  in  the  repaglinide  group  (-0.6%)  when  compared  with  baseline  values.  The 
changes in fasting plasma glucose were on average -1.5 mmol/l and in post-prandial plasma glucose - 
2.6  mmol/l  with  repaglinide  treatment,  and  +1.5  mmol/l  and  +2.9  mmol/l,  repectively  with  placebo. 
One aim in this study was to explore possible additional effects by increasing the dose to from 4 mg to 
8  mg  tid.  Twenty-four  of  66  patients  on  repaglinide  reached  the  8  mg  dose  level  and  16  of  these 
24 patients were titrated back down to 4 mg. 
Dose response study 
In another parallel, double blind dose response study randomising 145 patients, the aim was to show a 
dose response over four weeks and ensure that glycaemic control was in steady state within the two 
weeks recommended for dose titration in the phase III programme. Efficacy was calculated based on 
the  AUC  of  24-hour  blood  glucose.  The  lowest  effective  dose  was  0.25  mg  as  indicated  in  table  1 
below:

However, the 0.250 mg dose was judged not to be the clinically relevant dose for long-term treatment 
because randomisation allowed a relatively high proportion of treatment naive  patients to this group 
(35%). This was regarded to overestimate the treatment effect in this dose group and it was therefore 
decided  the  recommended  starting  dose  and  the  upper  limit  for  the  dose  preprandially  were  set  at 
0.5 mg and 4 mg, respectively in the confirmatory trials.  
Main studies 
Active-controlled studies  
Medium-term studies  
One study (n=195) with repaglinide in comparison with glibenclamide showed a decrease by 0.3% and 
0.4% respectively for HbA1c after 10 weeks of maintenance therapy.  
In  the  second  medium-term  study  recruiting  83  diabetic  patients,  randomised  to  repaglinide, 
metformin or the combination of the two drugs (n=27), HbA1c was equally reduced (-0.38 and -0.33) 
after 6 months in the two monotherapy arms, whereas the reduction (-1.41%) in the combination arm 
was at least additive. In addition to the improved efficacy in the combination arm of this study it was 
noted that the combination repaglinide and metformin conferred an increased risk of hypoglycaemia: 
No patients treated with metformin, 3 patients treated with repaglinide and 9 patients treated with the 
combination experienced hypoglycaemic reactions. 
Long-term studies 
The  total  number  of  patients  included  in  these  five  studies  was  1796:  1209  on  repaglinide,  407  on 
glibenclamide, 81 on glipizide and 99 on gliclazide. The withdrawal rates were about 33 percent for 
all drugs used (table 2).

All  three  comparisons  with  glibenclamide  showed  similar  changes  with  time  in  HbA1c.  levels. 
Equivalence  was  also  shown  with  gliclazide.  Repaglinide  appeared  to  be  better  than  glipizide  as 
indicated in the table 3. Analogous results were seen for fasting plasma glucose changes. 
Subset  analysis  of  all  five  comparator  studies  showed  the  greatest  effect  (a  reduction  of  HbA1c  of 
1.5%)  in  patients  previously  treated  with  diet  alone.  In  those  who  previously  received  oral 
hypoglycaemic  agent  monotherapy,  glycaemic  control  was  maintained.  Those  patients  who  had 
previously been treated with a combination therapy (sulphonyl urea and other hypoglycaemic agents) 
and were switched to monotherapy with repaglinide, had, as expected, an increase of 1% in HbA1c. 
The  distribution  of  different  dose  levels  was  the  same  for  repaglinide  and  the  comparators  with 
approximately 20% on dose level I (0.5 mg); 10-15% each on dose levels II and III (1 to 2 mg), and 
50% on dose level IV (4 mg). Good HbA1c ≤6.5% or borderline HbA1c ≤7.5% control was achieved in 
73%  of  the  SU-naive  patients  while  43%  achieved  the  same  control  in  the  previously  SU-treated 
6/11

patients.  Doses  were  titrated  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator  and  given  three  times  daily  before 
meals. It was noted that some patients were not dosed optimally and should have received an increased 
dose. 
Clinical studies in special  population 
There are no data in children or adolescents less than 18 years of age. 
There is no clinical experience in treating patients with hepatic insufficiency or in patients with severe 
renal insufficiency.  
About 25% (343) of the patients in the long-term active control trials were between 65 and 75 years of 
age but  there were  no  patients above 75 years of  age included in these  clinical trials. As  mentioned 
above,  values  for  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  comparable  for  elderly  >65  years  of  age 
although  higher  exposure  of  repaglinide  was  demonstrated  in  elderly  patients  with  Type  2  diabetes 
versus  healthy  elderly.  However,  further  analysis  of  the  response  in  elderly  showed  that  only  few 
patients have managed to maintain adequate control when treated with a dose of 0.25 mg three times 
daily. 
As described above exposure with repaglinide was increased in patients with severe renal impairment 
compared with healthy patients. The SPC reflects this issue. The clinical data base from the long-term 
studies  included  257  elderly  patients  with  mild/moderate  (Creatinine  clearance  <80  ml/min)  renal 
impairment. Following authorisation, the MAH submitted the results of an open-label, parallel group, 
study  in  which  281  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  and  renal  impairment  were  enrolled.  Based  on  the 
submitted  data  the  CHMP  concluded  that  no  special  precautions  appear  to  be  necessary  when  using 
repaglinide in-patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥ 40  ml/min/1.73  m2) and that 
repaglinide should not be withheld from patients with severe renal insufficiency (CLcr between 20 and 
40  ml/min/1.73m2)  provided  that  the  dose  will  be  carefully  titrated.  Severe  renal  insufficiency  was 
consequently deleted from the contraindications, section 4.3 of the SPC through a Type II variation. 
Clinical safety 
The  total  patient  years  of  exposure  corresponded  to  1205  (repaglinide),  412  (glibenclamide), 
74 (glipizide)  and  89  (gliclazide).  The  data  on  repaglinide  were  obtained  from  about  1600  patients 
treated in the controlled trials and about 500 in the pharmacology trials. Overall 26% of the population 
were >65 years.

Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths 
Treatment emergent adverse events  
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as all adverse events which occurred after 
initiation  of  treatment  until  7  days  after  ended  treatment.  As  indicated  in  table  5,  hypoglycaemia, 
upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  influenza-like  symptoms,  rhinitis,  backpain,  bronchitis,  pain, 
headache and hyperglycaemia were reported in at least 5% of repaglinide patients. These events were 
generally mild and did not appear more frequently with repaglinide.

The  withdrawal  rates  due  to  adverse  events  were  comparable  between  the  treatment  groups  as  is 
indicated  above  in  table  1.  For  repaglinide-treated  patients,  the  primary  reason  for  adverse  event 
withdrawal were hyper- and hypoglycaemia and related symptoms.  
Serious adverse events 
The  incidences  of serious  adverse  events were similar between  patients treated  with  repaglinide and 
sulfonylureas in the active control trials. Serious events accounted for less than 5% of the total number 
of  events  and  were  most  frequently  reported  as  myoendo,  pericardial  and  valve  disorders  (primarily 
angina pectoris and myocardial infarction) but the incidences were not higher than would be expected 
in  the  general  Type  2  diabetic  population.  However,  in  a  sub  group  analysis  an  increased  risk  of 
cardio-vascular  disorders  were  initially  reported  in  repaglinide-treated  patients  compared  with 
glibenclamide. The  relative risk  of serious cardiovascular adverse events ranged from  0.2  to 10.0  in 
various  analysis  with  borderline  statistical  significance  obtained  in  the  analysis  of  all  serious  events 
combined (point estimate 2.2; 95%CI: 1.1-4.5). However, further assessment of data indicated that this 
difference  was  due  mainly  to  cases  of  angina  pectoris  of  doubtful  significance  while  there  were  no 
difference  when  looking  at  more  severe  manifestations  of  myocardial  ischemia,  for  example 
myocardial  infarction  and  cardiac  deaths.  Blinded  re-reading  of  all  ECGs  from  the  glibenclamide-
controlled and dose-tolerance trials showed changes in the ECG were consistent with what could be 
expected in a middle-aged diabetes population even with doses up to 20mg, 4 times daily. There were 
no ischaemic, arrhythmic or other changes (QTc prolongation) in the ECGs. 
Thus,  after  statistical/epidemiological  assessment  of  the  data  considering  multiplicity  testing  and 
analysis of missing values and also taking into account the pooled study data with all sulfonyl ureas in 
the comparative trials and the background frequency in patients with Type 2 diabetes it was concluded 
that repaglinide did not pose any increased risk of cardiovascular events. 
A long-term study recruiting approximately 6000 patients has been initiated by the applicant. 
Deaths 
There  was  no  indication  of  excess  mortality  for  repaglinide-treated  patients  compared  to  sulfonyl- 
urea-treated patients.  
Laboratory findings 
Hypoglycaemic  reactions  were  reported  in  16%  of  repaglinide-treated  patients  in  the  five  active-
controlled  long-term  trials.  The  majority  of  these  reactions  were  graded  as  mild/moderate  and  were 
comparable to those seen in the control groups. Blood glucose measured in patients in connection with 
the occurrence of symptoms of hypoglycaemia suggested that relatively fewer cases occurred at very 
low blood glucose values (<45mg/dl) than in the sulfonylura-treated groups. The data supported that 
the  risk  of  clinically  significant  hypoglycaemia  was  low  both  after  treatment  with  repaglinide  and 
during dose titration.  
There did not seem to be any age dependency with regard to hypoglycaemic reactions albeit that there 
were no patients >75 years of age included in the clinical trials. As discussed under pharmacokinetics, 
the  exposure  was  higher  in  elderly  patients  with  Type  2  diabetes  than  in  healthy  elderly.  The  exact 
reason for this could not be determined. 
It can presently not be ruled out that a higher exposure in elderly >75 years of age may pose a risk to 
these patients.

Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physiochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated, and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Adequate pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in rats and dogs. 
Animal metabolism is similar to that in man. There was however, one metabolite in humans that could 
not be fully assessed pre-clinically because of low amounts being formed in animals. This metabolite 
identified  as  M10  is  found  in  human  urine  and  plasma  at  low  concentrations  (2%  of  administered 
dose). It was concluded that this low concentration is unlikely to represent a potential safety concern 
in humans.  
Efficacy 
Doses  and  dose  regimen  have  been  sufficiently  defined  and  adequate  pharmacokinetic  studies  were 
performed with the limitations indicated in the relevant part of the SPC. In vitro studies show that the 
cytochrome  P450  isoenzyme  3A4  is  solely  responsible  for  the  oxidative  metabolism  of  repaglinide. 
The involvement of CYP 3A4 in repaglinide biotrasformation was investigated in five clinical trials in 
healthy subjects. The results of these studies demonstrate that inducers, inhibitors or substrates of CYP 
3A4 iso-enzymes do not influence the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide to a clinically relevant extent. 
Also,  the  concomitant  administration  of  repaglinide  did  not  change  the  pharmakokinetics  of 
ethinylestradiol  and  nifedipine,  two  compounds  predominately  metabolised  by  CYP  3A4.  However 
there is some influence on the Cmax of simvastatin and rifampicin.Well defined clinical studies with 
active comparators and well defined study populations justify the claimed indication. It is concluded 
that repaglinide is at least equally effective as sulfonylureas in the treatment of NIDDM patients.  
In  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  severe  renal  impairment  led  to  an  increased  exposure  of  repaglinide. 
However, in the clinical long-term studies including 257 elderly patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment,  there  were  no  indications  of  an  increased  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  in  this  patient 
group.  Because  of  an  increased  sensitivity  to  insulin  in  patients  with  renal  impairment,  caution  is 
advised in titrating these patients.  
There  is  no  clinical  experience  in  treating  patients  with  hepatic  and  severe  renal  insufficiency  or  in 
elderly >75 years of age or in children and adolescents <18 years of age. 
The applicant will conduct post-marketing trials in special populations. 
Safety 
The clinical safety profile based on over 1600 patients treated with repaglinide was overall reassuring. 
The main reasons for withdrawal (13%) were hyperglycaemia (4%) and hypoglycaemia (1%). 
The  incidence  of  serious  cardiovascular  adverse  events  was  higher  with  repaglinide  than  with 
glibenclamide, but the difference was mainly due to angina pectoris of doubtful clinical significance 
and  was  not  present  for  more  severe  manifestations  of  myocardial  ischemia  such  as  infarction  or 
death.  Changes 
in  a  middle-aged  diabetes  population.  After 
statistical/epidemiological  assessment  of  the  data  considering  multiplicity  testing  and  analysis  of 
missing  values  and  also  taking  into  account  the  pooled  study  data  with  all  sulfonylureas  in  the 
comparative  trials  and  the  background  frequency  in  patients  with  Type  2  diabetes  it  was  concluded 
that repaglinide did not pose any increased risk of cardiovascular events. 
in  ECG 
reflected 
those 
Patients  aged  <65  year  and  those  aged  >65  years  appeared  to  be  similar  with  regard  to  withdrawal 
rates, dose levels attained/sustained and incidence of hypoglycaemia. As mentioned the company will 
perform further trials in elderly patients >75 years and in patients with renal impairment.  
Benefit/Risk Assessment  
There  is  a  lack  of  clinical  data  in  children  and  adolescents  and  in  patients  >75  years  as  well  as  in 
patients with hepatic and severe renal insufficiency. Pending comprehensive information on efficacy 
and  safety  in  these  patients  groups  the  CPMP  decided  to  highlight  these  concerns  in  the  relevant 
sections of the SPC. 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  NovoNorm  tablets  in  the  treatment  of  Type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  was 
favourable  in  the  following  indication:  "Repaglinide  is  indicated  in  patients    with  Type  2  diabetes 
(Non-Insulin-Dependent  Diabetes  Mellitus  (NIDDM))  whose  hyperglycaemia  can  no  longer  be 
10/11  
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
controlled  satisfactorily  by  diet,  weight  reduction  and  exercise.  Repaglinide  is  also  indicated  in 
combination  with  metformin  in  Type  2  diabetes  patients  who  are  not  satisfactorily  controlled  on 
metformin alone. Treatment should be initiated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to lower the blood 
glucose in relation to meals”. 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that the benefit/risk profile of NovoNorm was favourable in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.

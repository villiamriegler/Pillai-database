4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Lyumjev is a mealtime insulin for subcutaneous injection and should be administered zero to two 
minutes before the start of the meal, with the option to administer up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal (see section 5.1).  
Lyumjev 100 units/mL is suitable for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and is used for 
both the bolus and basal insulin requirement. 
The initial dose should take into account the type of diabetes, weight of the patient and their blood 
glucose levels.  
The early onset of action must be considered when prescribing Lyumjev (see section 5.1). Continued 
adjustment of the dose of Lyumjev should be based on the patient’s metabolic needs, blood glucose 
monitoring results, and glycaemic control goal. Dose adjustments may be needed, when switching 
from another insulin, with changes in physical activity, changes in concomitant medicinal products, 
changes in meal patterns (i.e., amount and type of food, timing of food intake), changes in renal or 
hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5).  
Switching from another mealtime insulin medicinal product 
If converting from another mealtime insulin to Lyumjev, the change can be done on a unit-to-unit 
basis. The potency of insulin analogues, including Lyumjev, is expressed in units. One (1) unit of 
Lyumjev corresponds to 1 international unit (IU) of human insulin or 1 unit of other fast-acting insulin 
analogues.  
Missed doses 
Patients who forget a mealtime dose should monitor their blood glucose level to decide if an insulin 
dose is needed, and to resume their usual dosing schedule at the next meal. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years old)  
The safety and efficacy of Lyumjev has been established in elderly patients aged 65 to 75 years. Close 
glucose monitoring is recommended and the insulin dose should be adjusted on an individual basis 
(see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). The therapeutic experience in patients ≥ 75 years of age is limited. 
Renal impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. In patients with renal 
impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Hepatic impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for 
gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown. In patients with hepatic impairment, glucose 
monitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Paediatric population 
Lyumjev can be used in adolescents and children from the age of 1 year (see section 5.1). There is no 
clinical experience with the use of Lyumjev in children below the age of 3 years. Similar to adults, 
dosage should be adjusted individually. Lyumjev is recommended to be administered zero to two 
minutes before the start of the meal, with the option to administer up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal when needed.

Method of administration 
Patients should be trained on proper use and injection technique before initiating Lyumjev. Patients 
should be told to: 
• 
• 
• 
Always check insulin labels before administration. 
Inspect Lyumjev visually before use and discard for particulate matter or discolouration. 
Injection or infusion sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the 
risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Carry a spare or alternative administration method in case their delivery system breaks. 
• 
Subcutaneous injection 
Lyumjev should be injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, upper arm, thigh or buttocks (see 
section 5.2). 
Lyumjev should generally be used in combination with an intermediate or long-acting insulin.  A 
different injection site should be used if injecting at the same time as another insulin.  
When injecting a blood vessel should not be entered.  
Devices should be discarded if any part looks broken or damaged.  
The needle should be discarded after each injection.  
Lyumjev vials 
If subcutaneous administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. 
The syringe must have 100 units/mL markings. 
Patients using vials must never share needles or syringes. 
Lyumjev cartridges 
Lyumjev in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a Lilly reusable pen.  
Lyumjev cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has not 
been established with other pens. 
The instructions with each individual pen must be followed for loading the cartridge, attaching the 
needle and administering the insulin injection. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by one patient only, even 
if the needle on the delivery device is changed. 
Lyumjev KwikPens and Lyumjev Tempo Pen 
The KwikPen , Junior KwikPen and Tempo Pen are only suitable for subcutaneous injections. 
Lyumjev KwikPens are available in two concentrations: Lyumjev 100 units/mL KwikPen and 
Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen. See the separate SmPC for Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen. The 
KwikPen delivers 1 - 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. The Lyumjev 100 units/mL Junior 
KwikPen delivers 0.5 - 30 units in steps of 0.5 units in a single injection.  
The Lyumjev 100 units/ml Tempo Pen delivers 1 – 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection.  
The number of insulin units is shown in the dose window of the pen regardless of concentration and no 
dose conversion should be done when transferring a patient to a new concentration or to a pen with a 
different dose step.  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL Junior KwikPen is suitable for patients who may benefit from finer insulin 
dose adjustments. 
The Tempo Pen can be used with the optional transfer module Tempo Smart Button (see section 6.6). 
As with any insulin injection, when using the Tempo Pen, Tempo Smart Button and the mobile 
application, the patient should be instructed to check their blood sugar levels when considering or 
making decisions about another injection if they are unsure how much they have injected. 
For detailed user instructions, please refer to the instructions for use provided with the package leaflet. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only, even if the 
needle is changed. 
CSII (insulin pump) 
Use a pump suitable for insulin infusion. Fill the pump reservoir from a Lyumjev 100 units/mL vial.  
Patients using a pump should follow the instructions provided with the pump and infusion set.  
Use the correct reservoir and catheter for the pump. 
When filling the pump reservoir avoid damaging it by using the correct needle length on the filling 
system. The infusion set (tubing and cannula) should be changed in accordance with the instructions in 
the product information supplied with the infusion set. 
A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels (see 
section 4.4). 
Intravenous use 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL is available in vials if administration of intravenous injection is necessary. This 
medicinal product must not be mixed with any other insulin or any other medicinal product except 
those mentioned in section 6.6. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
Intravenous administration of Lyumjev 100 units/mL must be performed under medical supervision. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypoglycaemia. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy. The timing of hypoglycaemia 
usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Hypoglycaemia may 
occur earlier after an injection/infusion when compared to other mealtime insulins due to the earlier 
onset of action of Lyumjev (see section 5.1). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over 
time in the same individual. Severe hypoglycaemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, 
may be life-threatening, or cause death. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycaemia may be less 
pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes. 
Hyperglycaemia 
The use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic 
ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal. 
Patients should be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and to get immediate 
help when ketoacidosis is suspected. 
Injection technique 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment 
of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Insulin requirements and dose adjustments 
Changes in insulin, insulin concentration, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect 
glycaemic control and predispose to hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. These changes should be 
made cautiously under close medical supervision and the frequency of glucose monitoring should be 
increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dose adjustments in concomitant anti-diabetic treatment 
may be needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and dose 
adjusted on an individual basis (see section 4.2). 
Insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. 
Adjustment of dose may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change 
their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis due to insulin pump device malfunction 
Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set can rapidly lead to hyperglycaemia and 
ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycaemia or ketosis is 
necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with Lyumjev may be required. 
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) used in combination with insulin 
TZDs can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid 
retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin and a TZD should be 
observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, consider discontinuation of 
the TZD. 
Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions 
Severe, life-threatening, generalised allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin medicinal 
products, including Lyumjev. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Lyumjev. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medication errors 
Lyumjev should not be used by patients with visual impairment without help of a trained person. 
To avoid medication errors between Lyumjev and other insulins, patients need to always check the 
insulin label before each injection.  
Patients should always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and a blocked needle. 
In the event of a blocked needle it should be replaced with a new needle.   
Tempo Pen 
The Tempo Pen contains a magnet (see section 6.5) that may interfere with the functions of an 
implantable electronic medical device, such as a pacemaker. The magnetic field extends to 
approximately 1.5 cm. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement: Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral or 
injectable), salicylates, sulphonamides, certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, or somatostatin analogues. 
The following substances may increase insulin requirement: oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, 
thyroid hormones, danazol, sympathomimetic agents, diuretics, or growth hormone. 
Alcohol may increase or decrease the blood glucose lowering effect of Lyumjev. Consumption of 
large amounts of ethanol concomitantly with insulin use may lead to severe hypoglycaemia.  
Beta-blockers may blunt the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
TZDs can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin, and 
exacerbate heart failure (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1 000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity of insulin lispro. Lyumjev can be used during pregnancy 
if clinically needed. 
It is essential to maintain good control of an insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational) diabetes 
patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase 
during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally return rapidly to 
pre-pregnancy values. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are 
pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential in 
pregnant patients with diabetes.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Lyumjev can be used during breast-feeding. Patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require 
adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both. 
Fertility 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using 
machinery). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is 
particularly important in those patients who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile  
The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia (very common) (see  
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.9). 
The following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred 
term by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common:

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin. The 
incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in the 26 week Phase 3 adult clinical studies was 5.5 % in patients 
with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 0.9 % in patients with type 2 diabetes (see tables 2 and 3). In Study 
PRONTO-Peds, severe hypoglycaemia was reported in 0.7 % of paediatric patients treated with 
Lyumjev. 
The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include listlessness, confusion, 
palpitations, sweating, vomiting, and headache.  
There were no clinically significant differences in the frequency of hypoglycaemia with administration 
of Lyumjev or the comparator (another medicinal product containing insulin lispro) across all studies. 
In studies where Lyumjev and the comparator were administered at different times relative to meals, 
there were no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of hypoglycaemia.    
Hypoglycaemia may occur earlier after an injection/infusion of Lyumjev compared to other mealtime 
insulins due to the earlier onset of action. 
Allergic reactions 
Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, 
angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including Lyumjev. 
Injection / Infusion site reactions 
As with other insulin therapy, patients may experience rash, redness, inflammation, pain, bruising or 
itching at the site of Lyumjev injection or infusion. 
In Studies PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D (multiple-dose injection [MDI] administration), 
injection site reactions occurred in 2.7 % of adult patients treated with Lyumjev. These reactions were 
usually mild and normally disappeared during continued treatment. Of the 1 116 patients who received 
Lyumjev, 1 discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions (< 0.1 %). 
In Study PRONTO-Peds, injection site reactions occurred in 6.2 % of paediatric patients treated with 
Lyumjev. These events were mild or moderate. Of the 418 patients treated with Lyumjev, 
2 discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions (< 0.5 %). 
In Study PRONTO-Pump-2, infusion site reactions were reported in 38 % of patients treated with 
Lyumjev. The majority of these events were mild. Of the 215 patients treated with Lyumjev, 
7 discontinued treatment due to infusion site reactions (3.3 %). 
Immunogenicity 
Administration of insulin can cause formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of anti-drug 
antibodies did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of 
Lyumjev. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce 
or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oedema  
Cases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic 
control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Paediatric population 
Safety and efficacy have been investigated in a therapeutic confirmatory trial in children with type 1 
diabetes aged 3 to < 18 years. In the trial, 418 patients were treated with Lyumjev. The frequency, type 
and severity of adverse reactions observed in the paediatric population is consistent with the safety 
profile in adult patients. 
Other special populations  
Based on results from clinical trials with insulin lispro in general, the frequency, type and severity of 
adverse reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not 
indicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population. The safety information in 
very elderly patients (≥ 75 years) or patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic 
impairment is limited (see section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose causes hypoglycaemia with accompanying symptoms that include listlessness, confusion, 
palpitations, sweating, vomiting, and headache.  
Hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin lispro relative to food intake, energy 
expenditure, or both. Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. More 
severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon or 
concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary 
because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Adjustments in drug dose, meal 
patterns, or exercise may be needed. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, 
ATC code: A10AB04. 
Mechanism of action 
The primary activity of Lyumjev is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin 
lispro, the active substance in Lyumjev, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. 
Receptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal 
muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, 
and enhance protein synthesis. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lyumjev is a formulation of insulin lispro that contains citrate and treprostinil. Citrate increases local 
vascular permeability and treprostinil induces local vasodilation to achieve accelerated absorption of 
insulin lispro. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Early and late insulin action 
A glucose clamp study was conducted in 40 type 1 diabetes patients given Lyumjev and Humalog 
subcutaneously as a single 15 unit dose. Results are provided in Figure 1. Lyumjev has been shown to 
be equipotent to Humalog on a unit for unit basis but its effect is more rapid with a shorter duration of 
action. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Onset of action of Lyumjev was 20 minutes post dose, 11 minutes faster than Humalog. 
During the first 30 minutes post dose, Lyumjev had a 3-fold greater glucose lowering effect 
compared to Humalog. 
Maximum glucose-lowering effect of Lyumjev occurred between 1 and 3 hours after injection. 
The late insulin action, from 4 hours until the end of the glucose clamp, was 54 % lower with 
Lyumjev than observed with Humalog. 
The duration of action of Lyumjev was 5 hours, 44 minutes shorter than Humalog. 
The total glucose infused during the clamp was comparable between Lyumjev and Humalog. 
Figure 1. Mean glucose infusion rate (GIR) in patients with type 1 diabetes after subcutaneous 
injection of Lyumjev or Humalog (15 unit dose) 
Similarly, a faster early insulin action and a reduced late insulin action was observed with Lyumjev in 
type 2 diabetes patients. 
Total and maximum glucose lowering effect of Lyumjev increased with dose within the therapeutic 
dose range. The early onset and total insulin action were similar when Lyumjev was administered in 
the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Postprandial Glucose (PPG) Lowering 
Lyumjev reduced the PPG during a standardized test meal over the complete 5 hour test meal period 
(change from premeal AUC(0 – 5 h)) compared to Humalog.  
• 
In patients with type 1 diabetes, Lyumjev reduced the PPG during the 5 hour test meal period by 
32 % when given at the start of the meal and 18 % when given 20 minutes after the start of the 
meal compared to Humalog. 
In patients with type 2 diabetes, Lyumjev reduced the PPG during the 5 hour test meal period by 
26 % when given at the start of the meal and 24 % when given 20 minutes after the start of the 
meal compared to Humalog. 
• 
Comparison of Lyumjev 200 units/mL and Lyumjev 100 units/mL 
The maximum and total glucose lowering were comparable for Lyumjev 200 units/mL or Lyumjev 
100 units/mL. No dose conversion is required if transferring a patient between the strengths. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Lyumjev was evaluated in 4 randomised, active controlled trials in adults and 1 
randomised, active controlled trial in paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. 
Type 1 Diabetes – Adults 
PRONTO-T1D was a 26 week, treat-to-target, trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lyumjev in 
1222 patients on multiple daily injection therapy. Patients were randomised to either blinded 
mealtime Lyumjev, blinded mealtime Humalog, or open-label postmeal Lyumjev, all in combination 
with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec. Mealtime Lyumjev or Humalog was injected 0 to 
2 minutes before the meal and postmeal Lyumjev was injected 20 minutes after the start of the meal. 
Efficacy results are provided in Table 2 and Figure 2. 
37.4 % of patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev, 33.6 % of patients treated with mealtime Humalog 
and 25.6 % of patients treated with postmeal Lyumjev reached a target HbA1c of < 7 %. 
Basal, bolus and total insulin doses were similar among study arms at 26 weeks. 
Following the 26 week period, the two blinded treatment arms continued to 52 weeks. HbA1c was not 
statistically significantly different between treatments at the 52 week endpoint.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in Type 1 Diabetes – Adults 
A subset of patients (N = 269) participated in an evaluation of the 24 hour ambulatory glucose profiles 
captured with blinded CGM. At the 26 week assessment, patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev 
demonstrated statistically significant improvement in PPG control during CGM assessment of glucose 
excursions or incremental area under the curve (AUC) 0 - 2 hours, 0 - 3 hours, and 0 - 4 hours after 
meals compared to patients treated with Humalog. Patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev reported 
statistically significantly longer time in range (6 am to midnight) with 603 minutes in range, (3.9 to 
10 mmol/L, 71 – 180 mg/dL), and 396 minutes in range (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L, 71 to 140  mg/dL), 44 and 
41 minutes longer than Humalog patients respectively.  
Type 2 Diabetes – Adults 
PRONTO-T2D was a 26 week, treat-to-target trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lyumjev in 
673 patients were randomised to either blinded mealtime Lyumjev or to blinded mealtime Humalog, 
both in combination with a basal insulin (insulin glargine or insulin degludec) in a basal-bolus 
regimen. Mealtime Lyumjev or mealtime Humalog was injected 0 - 2 minutes before the meal. 
Efficacy results are provided in Table 3 and Figure 3. 
58.2 % of patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev and 52.5 % of patients treated with mealtime 
Humalog reached a target HbA1c of < 7 %.

Type 1 Diabetes – Adults. CSII 
PRONTO-Pump was a 12 week cross over design (2 periods of 6 weeks), double-blind, trial that 
evaluated the compatibility and safety of Lyumjev and Humalog with an external CSII System in 
patients who wore a continuous glucose monitor throughout the study. There were no statistically 
significant treatment difference in the rate or incidence of infusion set failures (n = 49). 
In period 1 of the cross over study, Lyumjev had a numerically greater reduction in mean HbA1c than 
Humalog. Lyumjev reduction was -0.39 % [- 4.23 mmol/mol] from a baseline of 6.97 % 
[52.68 mmol/mol] and Humalog reduction was - 0.25 % [- 2.78 mmol/mol] from a baseline of 7.17 % 
[54.89 mmol/mol]. Lyumjev had a statistically significantly longer mean duration of time with glucose 
in target ranges 71 – 140 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L) within 1 and 2 hours after the start of breakfast 
compared to Humalog. 
PRONTO-Pump-2 was a 16 week randomised (1:1), double-blind, trial that evaluated the efficacy of 
Lyumjev in 432 patients with type 1 diabetes currently using continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion. Patients were randomised to either blinded Lyumjev (N = 215) or blinded Humalog 
(N = 217). Mealtime Lyumjev or Humalog boluses were initiated 0 to 2 minutes before the meal. 
At week 16, Lyumjev was non-inferior to Humalog in reducing HbA1c.  Lyumjev reduction 
was -0.06 % [- 0.7 mmol/mol] from a baseline of 7.56 % [59.1 mmol/mol] and Humalog reduction 
was  -0.09 % [- 1.0 mmol/mol] from a baseline of 7.54 % [58.9 mmol/mol]. The treatment difference 
was 0.02 % [95 % CI:  - 0.06, 0.11] and 0.3 mmol/mol [95 % CI:  - 0.6, 1.2], respectively compared to 
Humalog. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following a standardized test meal, treatment with Lyumjev demonstrated statistically significantly 
lower 1 hour and 2 hour postprandial glucose. The treatment difference was - 1.34 mmol/L [95 % CI: -
2.00, - 0.68] and -1.54 mmol/L [95 % CI:- 2.37, - 0.72], respectively compared to Humalog. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
In the two 26 week clinical studies (PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D), 187 of 1 116 (17 %) 
Lyumjev treated patients with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes were ≥ 65 years of age and 18 of 
1 116 (2 %) were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed 
between elderly patients and younger patients. 
Paediatric population 
PRONTO-Peds was a 26-week, randomised (2:2:1), treat-to-target, trial that evaluated the efficacy of 
Lyumjev in 716 patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 3 to < 18 years.  Patients were randomised to either 
blinded mealtime Lyumjev (N = 280), blinded mealtime Humalog (N = 298), or open-label postmeal 
Lyumjev (N = 138), all in combination with basal insulin (insulin glargine, insulin degludec or insulin 
detemir). Mealtime Lyumjev or Humalog was injected 0 to 2 minutes before the meal and postmeal 
Lyumjev was injected within 20 minutes after the start of the meal. 
Insulin doses were similar in all treatment groups at baseline and at 26 weeks.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Absorption of insulin lispro was accelerated and the duration of exposure was shorter in healthy 
subjects and patients with diabetes following injection of Lyumjev compared to Humalog. In patients 
with type 1 diabetes: 
• 
Insulin lispro appeared in circulation approximately 1 minute after injection of Lyumjev, which 
was five minutes faster than Humalog . 
Time to 50 % maximum concentration was 14 minutes shorter with Lyumjev compared to 
Humalog. 
• 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Following injection of Lyumjev, there was seven times more insulin lispro in circulation during 
the first 15 minutes compared to Humalog and three times more insulin lispro during the first 
30 minutes compared to Humalog. 
After administration of Lyumjev the time to maximum insulin lispro concentration was 
achieved at 57 minutes.  
Following injection of Lyumjev there was 41 % less insulin lispro in circulation after 3 hours 
following injection compared to Humalog.  
The duration of insulin lispro exposure for Lyumjev was 60 minutes shorter compared to 
Humalog. 
The total insulin lispro exposure (ratio and 95 % CI of 1.03 (0.973, 1.09) and maximum 
concentration (ratio and 95 % CI of 1.06 (0.97, 1.16) were comparable between Lyumjev and 
Humalog. 
In type 1 patients, the day-to-day variability [CV %] of Lyumjev was 13 % for total insulin lispro 
exposure (AUC, 0 - 10h) and 23 % for maximum insulin lispro concentration (Cmax).The absolute 
bioavailability of insulin lispro after subcutaneous administration of Lyumjev in the abdomen, upper 
arm and thigh was approximately 65 %. The accelerated absorption of insulin lispro is maintained 
regardless of injection site (abdomen, upper arm and thigh). No exposure data are available following 
injection in the buttocks.  
Maximum concentration and time to maximum concentration were comparable for the abdomen and 
upper arm regions; time to maximum concentration was longer and maximum concentration lower for 
the thigh. 
Total insulin lispro exposure and maximum insulin lispro concentration increased proportionally with 
increasing subcutaneous doses of Lyumjev within the dose range from 7U to 30U. 
CSII  
The absorption of insulin lispro was accelerated when Lyumjev was administered by CSII in patients 
with type 1 diabetes.  
• 
Time to reach 50 % maximum concentration was 14 minutes, 9 minutes shorter than for 
Humalog. 
Following administration of Lyumjev, 1.5 times more insulin lispro was available during the 
first 30 minutes compared to Humalog. 
• 
Comparison of Lyumjev 200 units/mL and Lyumjev 100 units/mL 
The results of a study in healthy subjects demonstrated that Lyumjev 200 units/mL is bioequivalent to 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL following administration of a single 15 unit dose for the area under serum 
insulin lispro concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and maximum insulin lispro 
concentration. The accelerated insulin lispro absorption after administration of 200 units/mL was 
similar to that observed with Lyumjev 100 units/mL. No dose conversion is required if transferring a 
patient between the strengths.  
Distribution 
The geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV %]) volume of distribution of insulin lispro (Vd) 
was 34 L (30 %) after intravenous administration of Lyumjev as a bolus injection of a 15 unit dose in 
healthy subjects. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean (CV %) clearance of insulin lispro was 32 L/hour (22 %) and the median half-life 
of insulin lispro was 44 minutes after intravenous administration of Lyumjev as a bolus injection of a 
15 unit dose in healthy subjects. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Age, gender, and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Lyumjev.  
Paediatric population 
Children (8 - 11 years) and adolescents (12 - 17 years) with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injection 
(MDI) and CSII therapy were studied in a cross-over design to assess the insulin lispro 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics following a 0.2 U/kg dose of Lyumjev and Humalog. 
The pharmacokinetic differences between Lyumjev and Humalog were, overall, similar in children 
and adolescents as observed in adults. Following a subcutaneous injection, Lyumjev showed an 
accelerated absorption with a higher early insulin lispro exposure in children (8 – 11 years) and 
adolescents (12 – 17 years) whilst maintaining a similar total exposure, maximum concentration and 
time to maximum concentration compared to Humalog. Following a subcutaneous bolus infusion with 
CSII therapy, there was a trend towards an accelerated absorption in children and adolescents whilst 
total exposure, maximum concentration and time to maximum concentration were similar compared to 
Humalog. 
Patients with renal and hepatic impairment 
Renal and hepatic impairment is not known to impact the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development after exposure to insulin lispro.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Lyumjev is a mealtime insulin for subcutaneous injection and should be administered zero to two 
minutes before the start of the meal, with the option to administer up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal (see section 5.1). 
The initial dose should take into account the type of diabetes, weight of the patient and their blood 
glucose levels.  
The early onset of action must be considered when prescribing Lyumjev (see section 5.1). Continued 
adjustment of the dose of Lyumjev should be based on the patient’s metabolic needs, blood glucose 
monitoring results, and glycaemic control goal. Dose adjustments may be needed, when switching 
from another insulin, with changes in physical activity, changes in concomitant medicinal products, 
changes in meal patterns (i.e., amount and type of food, timing of food intake), changes in renal or 
hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Switching from another mealtime insulin medicinal product 
If converting from another mealtime insulin to Lyumjev, the change can be done on a unit-to-unit 
basis. The potency of insulin analogues, including Lyumjev, is expressed in units. One (1) unit of 
Lyumjev corresponds to 1 international unit (IU) of human insulin or 1 unit of other fast-acting insulin 
analogues.  
Missed doses 
Patients who forget a mealtime dose should monitor their blood glucose level to decide if an insulin 
dose is needed, and to resume their usual dosing schedule at the next meal. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years old)  
The safety and efficacy of Lyumjev has been established in elderly patients aged 65 to 75 years. Close 
glucose monitoring is recommended and the insulin dose should be adjusted on an individual basis 
(see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). The therapeutic experience in patients ≥ 75 years of age is limited. 
Renal impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. In patients with renal 
impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Hepatic impairment 
Insulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for 
gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown. In patients with hepatic impairment, glucose 
monitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Lyumjev 200 units/mL in children and adolescents below 18 years of age 
have not been established  
Method of administration 
Patients should be trained on proper use and injection technique before initiating Lyumjev. Patients 
should be told to: 
• 
• 
• 
Always check insulin labels before administration. 
Inspect Lyumjev visually before use and discard for particulate matter or discolouration. 
Injection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of 
lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Ensure when injecting that a blood vessel has not been entered.  
Discard the needle after each injection  
Discard devices if any part looks broken or damaged.  
Carry a spare or alternative administration method in case their delivery system breaks. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Lyumjev should be injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, upper arm, thigh or buttocks (see 
section 5.2). 
Lyumjev should generally be used in combination with an intermediate or long-acting insulin. A 
different injection site should be used if injecting at the same time as another insulin.  
The Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. 
Lyumjev 200 units/mL should not be administered using a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion 
(CSII) pump. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lyumjev 200 units/mL should not be administered intravenously. 
Lyumjev is available in two concentrations: Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen and Lyumjev 
100 units/mL KwikPen. See the separate SmPC for Lyumjev 100 units/mL KwikPen. The KwikPen 
delivers 1 - 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. The number of insulin units is shown in the 
dose window of the pen regardless of concentration and no dose conversion should be done when 
transferring a patient to a new concentration or to a pen with a different dose step.  
For detailed user instructions, please refer to the instructions for use provided with the package leaflet. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only, even if the 
needle is changed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypoglycaemia. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy. The timing of hypoglycaemia 
usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Hypoglycaemia may 
occur earlier after an injection when compared to other mealtime insulins due to the earlier onset of 
action of Lyumjev (see section  5.1). 
Hypoglycaemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over 
time in the same individual. Severe hypoglycaemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, 
may be life-threatening, or cause death. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycaemia may be less 
pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes. 
Hyperglycaemia 
The use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic 
ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal. 
Patients should be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and to get immediate 
help when ketoacidosis is suspected. 
Injection technique 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment 
of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insulin requirements and dose adjustments 
Changes in insulin, insulin concentration, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect 
glycaemic control and predispose to hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. These changes should be 
made cautiously under close medical supervision and the frequency of glucose monitoring should be 
increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dose adjustments in concomitant anti-diabetic treatment 
may be needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and dose 
adjusted on an individual basis (see section 4.2). 
Insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. 
Adjustment of dose may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change 
their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) used in combination with insulin 
TZDs can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid 
retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin and a TZD should be 
observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, consider discontinuation of 
the TZD. 
Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions 
Severe, life-threatening, generalised allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin medicinal 
products, including Lyumjev. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Lyumjev. 
Medication errors 
Lyumjev should not be used by patients with visual impairment without help of a trained person. 
To avoid medication errors between Lyumjev and other insulins, patients need to always check the 
insulin label before each injection. 
Do not transfer insulin from the Lyumjev Pen 200 units/mL to a syringe. The markings on the insulin 
syringe will not measure the dose correctly and can result in overdose and severe hypoglycaemia. 
Patients should always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and a blocked needle. 
In the event of a blocked needle it should be replaced with a new needle.   
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement: Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral or 
injectable), salicylates, sulphonamides, certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 
angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, or somatostatin analogues. 
The following substances may increase insulin requirement: oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, 
thyroid hormones, danazol, sympathomimetic agents, diuretics, or growth hormone. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alcohol may increase or decrease the blood glucose lowering effect of Lyumjev. Consumption of 
large amounts of ethanol concomitantly with insulin use may lead to severe hypoglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers may blunt the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
TZDs can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin, and 
exacerbate heart failure (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1 000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity of insulin lispro. Lyumjev can be used during pregnancy 
if clinically needed. 
It is essential to maintain good control of an insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational) diabetes 
patient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase 
during the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally return rapidly to 
pre-pregnancy values. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are 
pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential in 
pregnant patients with diabetes.  
Breast-feeding 
Lyumjev can be used during breast-feeding. Patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require 
adjustments in insulin dose, diet or both. 
Fertility 
Insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using 
machinery). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is 
particularly important in those patients who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile  
The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia (very common) (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.9). 
The following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred 
term by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common: 
≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: ≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000; very rare: 
< 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin The 
incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in the 26 week Phase 3 clinical studies was 5.5 % in patients with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus and 0.9 % in patients with type 2 diabetes (see tables  2 and 3). 
The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include listlessness, confusion, 
palpitations, sweating, vomiting, and headache.  
There were no clinically significant differences in the frequency of hypoglycaemia with administration 
of Lyumjev or the comparator (another medicinal product containing insulin lispro) across all studies. 
In studies where Lyumjev and the comparator were administered at different times relative to meals, 
there were no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of hypoglycaemia.    
Hypoglycaemia may occur earlier after an injection of Lyumjev compared to other mealtime insulins 
due to the earlier onset of action. 
Allergic reactions 
Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, 
angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including Lyumjev. 
Injection site reactions 
As with other insulin therapy, patients may experience rash, redness, inflammation, pain, bruising or 
itching at the site of Lyumjev injection. These reactions are usually mild and usually disappear during 
continued treatment. 
Immunogenicity 
Administration of insulin can cause formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of anti-drug 
antibodies did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of 
Lyumjev. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce 
or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Oedema  
Cases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic 
control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Special populations  
Based on results from clinical trials with insulin lispro in general, the frequency, type and severity of 
adverse reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not 
indicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population. The safety information in 
very elderly patients (≥ 75 years) or patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic 
impairment is limited (see section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose causes hypoglycaemia with accompanying symptoms that include listlessness, confusion, 
palpitations, sweating, vomiting, and headache.  
Hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin lispro relative to food intake, energy 
expenditure, or both. Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. More 
severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon or 
concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary 
because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Adjustments in drug dose, meal 
patterns, or exercise may be needed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, 
ATC code: A10AB04. 
Mechanism of action 
The primary activity of Lyumjev is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin 
lispro, the active substance in Lyumjev, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. 
Receptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal 
muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, 
and enhance protein synthesis. 
Lyumjev is a formulation of insulin lispro that contains citrate and treprostinil. Citrate increases local 
vascular permeability and treprostinil induces local vasodilation to achieve accelerated absorption of 
insulin lispro. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Early and late insulin action 
A glucose clamp study was conducted in 40 type 1 diabetes patients given Lyumjev and Humalog 
subcutaneously as a single 15 unit dose. Results are provided in Figure 1. Lyumjev has been shown to 
be equipotent to Humalog on a unit for unit basis but its effect is more rapid with a shorter duration of 
action. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Onset of action of Lyumjev was 20 minutes post dose, 11 minutes faster than Humalog. 
During the first 30 minutes post dose, Lyumjev had a 3-fold greater glucose lowering effect 
compared to Humalog. 
Maximum glucose-lowering effect of Lyumjev occurred between 1 and 3 hours after injection. 
The late insulin action, from 4 hours until the end of the glucose clamp, was 54 % lower with 
Lyumjev than observed with Humalog. 
The duration of action of Lyumjev was 5 hours, 44 minutes shorter than Humalog. 
The total glucose infused during the clamp was comparable between Lyumjev and Humalog. 
Figure 1. Mean glucose infusion rate (GIR) in patients with type 1 diabetes after subcutaneous 
injection of Lyumjev or Humalog (15 unit dose) 
Similarly, a faster early insulin action and a reduced late insulin action was observed with Lyumjev in 
type 2 diabetes patients. 
Total and maximum glucose lowering effect of Lyumjev increased with dose within the therapeutic 
dose range. The early onset and total insulin action were similar when Lyumjev was administered in 
the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh. 
Postprandial Glucose (PPG) Lowering 
Lyumjev reduced the PPG during a standardized test meal over the complete 5 hour test meal period 
(change from premeal AUC(0-5h)) compared to Humalog. 
• 
In patients with type 1 diabetes, Lyumjev reduced the PPG during the 5 hour test meal period by 
32 % when given at the start of the meal and 18 % when given 20 minutes after the start of the 
meal compared to Humalog. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
In patients with type 2 diabetes, Lyumjev reduced the PPG during the 5 hour test meal period by 
26 % when given at the start of the meal and 24 % when given 20 minutes after the start of the 
meal compared to Humalog. 
Comparison of Lyumjev 200 units/mL and Lyumjev 100 units/mL 
The maximum and total glucose lowering were comparable for Lyumjev 200 units/mL or Lyumjev 
100 units/mL No dose conversion is required if transferring a patient between the strengths. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Lyumjev was evaluated in 2 randomised, active controlled trials in adults.  
Type 1 Diabetes – Adults 
PRONTO-T1D was a 26 week, treat-to-target, trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lyumjev in 
1222 patients on multiple daily injection therapy. Patients were randomised to either blinded 
mealtime Lyumjev, blinded mealtime Humalog , or open-label postmeal Lyumjev , all in combination 
with either insulin glargine  or insulin degludec. Mealtime Lyumjev or Humalog was injected 0 to 
2 minutes before the meal and postmeal Lyumjev was injected 20 minutes after the start of the meal. 
Efficacy results are provided in Table 2 and Figure 2. 
37.4 % of patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev, 33.6 % of patients treated with mealtime Humalog 
and 25.6 % of patients treated with postmeal Lyumjev reached a target HbA1c of < 7 %. 
Basal, bolus and total insulin doses were similar among study arms at 26 weeks. 
Following the 26 week period, the two blinded treatment arms continued to 52 weeks. HbA1c was not 
statistically significantly different between treatments at the 52 week endpoint.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in Type 1 Diabetes – Adults 
A subset of patients (N = 269) participated in an evaluation of the 24 hour ambulatory glucose profiles 
captured with blinded CGM. At the 26 week assessment, patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev 
demonstrated statistically significant improvement in PPG control during CGM assessment of glucose 
excursions or incremental area under the curve (AUC) 0 - 2 hours, 0 - 3 hours, and 0 - 4 hours after 
meals compared to patients treated with Humalog. Patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev reported 
statistically significantly longer time in range (6 am to midnight) with 603 minutes in range, (3.9 to 
10 mmol/L, 71 – 180 mg/dL), and 396 minutes in range (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L, 71 to 140  mg/dL), 44 and 
41 minutes longer than Humalog patients respectively.  
Type 2 Diabetes – Adults 
PRONTO-T2D was a 26 week, treat-to-target trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lyumjev in 
673 patients randomised to either blinded mealtime Lyumjev or to blinded mealtime Humalog, both 
in combination with a basal insulin (insulin glargine or insulin degludec) in a basal-bolus regimen. . 
Mealtime Lyumjev or mealtime Humalog was injected 0 - 2 minutes before the meal. 
Efficacy results are provided in Table 3 and Figure 3. 
58.2 % of patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev and 52.5 % of patients treated with mealtime 
Humalog reached a target HbA1c of < 7 %.

Special populations 
Elderly  
In the two 26 week clinical studies (PRONTO-T1D and PRONTO-T2D), 187 of 1 116 (17 %) 
Lyumjev treated patients with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes were ≥ 65 years of age and 18 of 
1 116 (2 %) were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed 
between elderly patients and younger patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Absorption of insulin lispro was accelerated and the duration of exposure was shorter in healthy 
subjects and patients with diabetes following injection of Lyumjev compared to Humalog. In patients 
with type 1 diabetes: 
• 
Insulin lispro appeared in circulation approximately 1 minute after injection of Lyumjev, which 
was five minutes faster than Humalog . 
Time to 50 % maximum concentration was 14 minutes shorter with Lyumjev compared to 
Humalog. 
Following injection of Lyumjev, there was seven times more insulin lispro in circulation during 
the first 15 minutes compared to Humalog and three times more insulin lispro during the first 
30 minutes compared to Humalog. 
After administration of Lyumjev the time to maximum insulin lispro concentration was 
achieved at 57 minutes.  
Following injection of Lyumjev there was 41 % less insulin lispro in circulation after 3 hours 
following injection compared to Humalog.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The duration of insulin lispro exposure for Lyumjev was 60 minutes shorter compared to 
Humalog. 
The total insulin lispro exposure (ratio and 95 % CI of 1.03 (0.973, 1.09) and maximum 
concentration (ratio and 95 % CI of 1.06 (0.97, 1.16) were comparable between Lyumjev and 
Humalog. 
In type 1 patients, the day-to-day variability [CV %] of Lyumjev was 13 % for total insulin lispro 
exposure (AUC, 0 - 10h) and 23 % for maximum insulin lispro concentration (Cmax).The absolute 
bioavailability of insulin lispro after subcutaneous administration of Lyumjev in the abdomen, upper 
arm and thigh was approximately 65 %. The accelerated absorption of insulin lispro is maintained 
regardless of injection site (abdomen, upper arm and thigh). No exposure data are available following 
injection in the buttocks.  
Maximum concentration and time to maximum concentration were comparable for the abdomen and 
upper arm regions; time to maximum concentration was longer and maximum concentration lower for 
the thigh. 
Total insulin lispro exposure and maximum insulin lispro concentration increased proportionally with 
increasing subcutaneous doses of Lyumjev within the dose range from 7U to 30U. 
Comparison of Lyumjev 200 units/mL and Lyumjev 100 units/mL 
The results of a study in healthy subjects demonstrated that Lyumjev 200 units/mL is bioequivalent to 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL following administration of a single 15 unit dose for the area under serum 
insulin lispro concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and maximum insulin lispro 
concentration. The accelerated insulin lispro absorption after administration of 200 units/mL was 
similar to that observed with Lyumjev 100 units/mL. No dose conversion is required if transferring a 
patient between the strengths.  
Distribution 
The geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV %]) volume of distribution of insulin lispro (Vd) 
was 34 L (30 %) after intravenous administration of Lyumjev as a bolus injection of a 15 unit dose in 
healthy subjects. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean (CV %) clearance of insulin lispro was 32 L/hour (22 %) and the median half-life 
of insulin lispro was 44 minutes after intravenous administration of Lyumjev as a bolus injection of a 
15 unit dose in healthy subjects. 
Special populations 
In adult subjects, age, gender, and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
Lyumjev.  
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetic differences between Lyumjev and Humalog were, overall, similar in children 
and adolescents as observed in adults. Following a subcutaneous injection, Lyumjev showed an 
accelerated absorption with a higher early insulin lispro exposure in children (8–11 years) and 
adolescents (12–17 years) whilst maintaining a similar total exposure, maximum concentration and 
time to maximum concentration compared to Humalog. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with renal and hepatic impairment 
Renal and hepatic impairment is not known to impact the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development after exposure to insulin lispro.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lyumjev is and what it is used for  
Lyumjev 100 units/ml solution for injection in vial contains the active ingredient insulin lispro. 
Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. It 
is a mealtime insulin that works more quickly than other medicines containing insulin lispro. Lyumjev 
contains ingredients that speed up absorption of insulin lispro into the body. 
Diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin 
effectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin 
medicine that is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of 
diabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. 
Treatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from 
your diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up 
to 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not 
change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Lyumjev  
Do NOT use Lyumjev 
• 
if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on, this leaflet tells you 
how to deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you use more Lyumjev than you 
should”). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
• 
90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. 
If you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  
• 
Low blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  
Lyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia 
occurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia 
or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar 
levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may 
not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later 
in this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. 
You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. 
You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. 
Making changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  
It may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood 
sugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicines.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   
• 
Stopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic 
ketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common 
problems of diabetes”. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you are using an insulin pump and it stops working you will need to fix the problem 
immediately as this can lead to high blood sugar. You may need to take an injection of Lyumjev 
using an insulin pen or a syringe if your pump stops working. 
If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicines called 
thiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you 
get signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). 
If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using 
this medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. 
Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from 
your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. 
Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you 
can then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side 
effects”. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a 
needle is blocked replace it with a new needle. 
Skin changes at the injection site. 
• 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Lyumjev). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting into a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year. 
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Lyumjev 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change. 
Your blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) 
acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) 
some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) 
some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for 
some heart problems or high blood pressure) 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) 
somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving 
too much growth hormone) 
Your blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol (for endometriosis) 
the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) 
thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) 
human growth hormone  (for growth hormone deficiency) 
diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body)  
sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  
corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) 
Beta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the 
warning signs of low blood sugar.  
Lyumjev with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you 
need usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. 
After you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed 
before your pregnancy.  
There are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, 
you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Lyumjev contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

3. 
How to use Lyumjev 
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has 
told you. Check with them if you are not sure.  
They will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will 
also tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  
You should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. 
If you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to  make your injections.  
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject 
them separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. 
When to inject Lyumjev 
Lyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two 
before the meal; you also have the option to inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal.  
How much insulin to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  
• 
• 
• 
•  What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are 
How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. 
How and when to check your blood sugar level.  
How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. 
• 
using other medicines. 
If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This 
might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Do not use Lyumjev 
• 
If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). 
If the plastic cap of the vial is damaged, do not use.  
Where to inject Lyumjev 
• 
• 
Inject Lyumjev under the skin (subcutaneous injection). 
Do not inject yourself directly into a vein. Only your physician can administer Lyumjev by the 
intravenous use. He will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are 
ill and your sugar levels are too high. 
Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places you 
inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen), as you have been taught.  
If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
How to inject Lyumjev from a vial 
• 
First wash your hands. 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Clean the rubber 
stopper on the vial, but do not remove the stopper. 
Use a new, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of 
Lyumjev you want. Your doctor, nurse or clinic will tell you how to do this. Do not share your 
needles and syringes. 
Inject under the skin, as you were taught. After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 
seconds to make sure you receive the full dose.   
• 
• 
Using Lyumjev in an insulin pump  
• 
Only certain insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse Lyumjev.  
93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Carefully follow the instructions supplied with your infusion pump. 
Be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump. It is important to use the correct 
needle length on the filling system to avoid damaging the pump. 
Change the infusion set (tubing and needle) according to the instructions supplied with the 
infusion set.  
If repeated or severe low blood sugar levels occur, tell your doctor or nurse. 
A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in sugar levels. 
If you think Lyumjev is not flowing, follow the pump instructions and if appropriate, notify 
your doctor or nurse.  
•  You may need to take an injection of Lyumjev if your pump does not work properly. 
After injecting 
If you are unsure how much you have injected then check your blood sugar levels before deciding if 
you need another injection. 
If you use more Lyumjev than you should 
If you inject too much Lyumjev, or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar may 
occur. Check your blood sugar. 
If your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or 
drink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you 
and have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check 
your blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. 
If you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, 
have difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. 
This can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If 
glucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to 
tell you about glucagon. 
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical 
help straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
If you forget to use Lyumjev 
If you forget to use your insulin or you use less than you should, or are unsure how much you have 
injected, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide 
if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your usual dosing schedule at your next meal. 
If you stop using Lyumjev 
Do not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you use less Lyumjev than you 
should, a high blood sugar may occur. 
If high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4 ).  
Three simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
• 
• 
Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Lyumjev. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 
under ‘If you use more Lyumjev than you should’. 
Allergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may 
include the following symptoms: 
•  rash over the whole body  
•  difficulty in breathing  
•  wheezing 
•  blood pressure dropping  
•  heart beating fast  
•  sweating 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight 
away. 
Other side effects include 
Very common 
Infusion site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the 
insulin infusion. If you have infusion site reactions, tell your doctor 
Common  
Injection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the 
insulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop 
Lyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
the build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very well 
if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin 
changes. 
Other potential side effects 
Swelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema), particularly at the start of insulin therapy 
or during a change in your diabetes medicines. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
Low blood sugar  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble 
with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
See section ‘If you use more Lyumjev than you should.’ 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
rapid heart beat 
nervousness or shakiness 
feeling sick 
headache 
cold sweat 
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too 
high. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your insulin; 
using less insulin than your body needs;   
an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
The early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  
• 
• 
• 
• 
being very thirsty  
headache  
feeling sleepy 
urinating more often 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
nausea and/or vomiting 
abdominal pain 
rapid pulse 
heavy breathing 
moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for 
energy instead of glucose. 
If you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. 
See section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. 
Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Lyumjev is and what it is used for 
Lyumjev 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge contains the active ingredient insulin lispro. 
Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults,adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. It 
is a mealtime insulin that works more quickly than other medicines containing insulin lispro. Lyumjev 
contains ingredients that speed up absorption of insulin lispro into the body. 
Diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin 
effectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin 
medicinethat is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of 
diabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. 
Treatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from 
your diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up 
to 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not 
change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  
2. 
What you need to know before you use Lyumjev  
Do NOT use Lyumjev 
• 
if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on, this leaflet tells you 
how to deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you use more Lyumjev than you 
should”). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. 
If you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  
• 
Low blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  
Lyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia 
occurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia 
or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar 
levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may 
not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later 
in this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. 
You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. 
You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. 
Making changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  
It may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood 
sugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicines.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   
• 
Stopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic 
ketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common 
problems of diabetes”. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicines called 
thiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you 
get signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). 
If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using 
this medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. 
Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from 
your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use.  
Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you 
can then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side 
effects”. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a 
needle is blocked replace it with a new needle. 
Skin changes at the injection site. 
• 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Lyumjev). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting into a different area. Your 
doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year.  
Other medicines and Lyumjev 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change. 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) 
acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) 
some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) 
some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for 
some heart problems or high blood pressure) 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) 
somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving 
too much growth hormone) 
Your blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol (for endometriosis)  
the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) 
thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) 
human growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency) 
diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body)  
sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  
corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) 
Beta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the 
warning signs of low blood sugar. 
Lyumjev with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you 
need usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. 
After you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed 
before your pregnancy.  
There are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, 
you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Lyumjev contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Lyumjev 
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has 
told you. Check with them if you are not sure.  
102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will 
also tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by you only, even if the 
needle on the pen is changed. 
You should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. 
If you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to  make your injections. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject 
them separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. 
When to inject Lyumjev 
Lyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two 
before the meal; you also have the option to inject  up to 20 minutes after starting the meal.  
How much insulin to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  
• 
• 
• 
•  What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are 
How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. 
How and when to check your blood sugar level.  
How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. 
• 
using other medicines. 
If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This 
might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Do not use Lyumjev 
• 
If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). 
If the cartridge is damaged in any way, do not use.  
Getting the pen ready to use 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge. 
You must only use Lyumjev cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that 
Lyumjev or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The 3 ml 
cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen. 
Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen.  
Use a new needle. (Needles are not included). 
Prime every time. The pen must be primed until you see insulin at the needle tip before each 
injection to make sure the pen is ready to dose. If you do not prime, you may get the wrong 
dose. 
Injecting Lyumjev 
• 
• 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin.  
Inject under the skin (subcutaneous injection), as you were taught by your physician or nurse.  
After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full 
dose. Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places 
you inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen). 
If you do not have enough insulin in the pen to complete your dose, make a note of how much 
you still need to take. Prime a new pen and inject the remaining dose. 
If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. 
Do not inject directly into a vein.

After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap. 
This will keep the Lyumjev sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the 
pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace 
the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. 
If you are unsure how much you have injected then check your blood sugar levels before 
deciding if you need another injection. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you plan to make an injection use a new needle. Before every injection, prime the 
pen to clear any large air bubbles.  
Once the cartridge is empty, do not use it again.  
• 
• 
If you use more Lyumjev than you should 
If you inject too much Lyumjev, or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar may 
occur. Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or 
drink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you 
and have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check 
your blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. 
If you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, 
have difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. 
This can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If 
glucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to 
tell you about glucagon. 
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical 
help straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
If you forget to use Lyumjev 
If you forget to use your insulin or you usee less than you should, or are unsure how much you have 
injected, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide 
if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your usual dosing schedule at your next meal. 
If you stop using Lyumjev 
Do not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you use less Lyumjev than you 
should, a high blood sugar may occur. 
If high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4).  
Three simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
Always keep a spare pen and cartridges, in case you lose your pen or cartridges or they get 
damaged. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
• 
• 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 
under ‘If you use more Lyumjev than you should’. 
Allergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may 
include the following symptoms: 
•  rash over the whole body  
•  difficulty in breathing  
•  wheezing 
•  blood pressure dropping  
•  heart beating fast  
•  sweating 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight 
away. 
Other side effects include 
Common  
Injection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the 
insulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop 
Lyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
the build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very well 
if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin 
changes. 
Other potential side effects 
Swelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema) particularly at the start of insulin therapy or 
during a change in your diabetes medicines. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
Low blood sugar  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble 
with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
See section “If you use more Lyumjev than you should”. 
105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
rapid heart beat 
nervousness or shakiness 
feeling sick 
headache 
cold sweat 
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too 
high. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your insulin; 
using less insulin than your body needs; 
an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
The early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  
• 
• 
• 
• 
being very thirsty  
headache  
feeling sleepy 
urinating more often 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
nausea and/or vomiting 
abdominal pain 
rapid pulse 
heavy breathing 
moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for 
energy instead of glucose. 
If you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. 
See section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. 
Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Lyumjev KwikPen is and what it is used for 
Lyumjev 100 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen contains the active ingredient 
insulin lispro. Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 
1 year and above. It is a mealtime insulin that works more quickly than other medicines containing 
insulin lispro. Lyumjev contains ingredients that speed up absorption of insulin lispro into the body. 
Diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin 
effectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin 
medicinethat is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of 
diabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. 
Treatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from 
your diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up 
to 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not 
change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  
The Lyumjev 100 units/ml KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 
100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin. The KwikPen dials 
1 unit at a time. The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before 
your injection. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose is more than 
60 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.

2. 
What you need to know before you use Lyumjev KwikPen 
Do NOT use Lyumjev KwikPen  
• 
if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on, this leaflet tells you 
how to deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you use more Lyumjev than you 
should”). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. 
If you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  
• 
Low blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  
Lyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia 
occurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia 
or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar 
levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may 
not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later 
in this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. 
You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. 
You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. 
Making changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  
It may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood 
sugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicines.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   
• 
Stopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic 
ketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common 
problems of diabetes”. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicines called 
thiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you 
get signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). 
If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using 
this medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. 
Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from 
your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. 
Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you 
can then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side 
effects”. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a 
needle is blocked replace it with a new needle. 
Skin changes at the injection site. 
• 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Lyumjev KwikPen). Contact your 
doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting into a different area. 
Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your 
other antidiabetic medications dose.

Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year.  
Other medicines and Lyumjev 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change. 
Your blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) 
acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) 
some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) 
some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for 
some heart problems or high blood pressure) 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) 
somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving 
too much growth hormone) 
Your blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol (for endometriosis)  
the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) 
thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) 
human growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency) 
diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body)  
sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  
corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) 
Beta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the 
warning signs of low blood sugar.  
Lyumjev with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you 
need usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. 
After you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed 
before your pregnancy.  
There are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, 
you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia

Lyumjev KwikPen contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Lyumjev KwikPen 
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has 
told you. Check with them if you are not sure.  
They will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will 
also tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, even if the needle 
is changed. 
You should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. 
If you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to  make your injections. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject 
them separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. 
When to inject Lyumjev 
Lyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two 
before the meal; you also have the option to inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. 
 How much insulin to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  
• 
• 
• 
•  What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are 
How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. 
How and when to check your blood sugar level.  
How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. 
• 
using other medicines. 
If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This 
might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Do not use Lyumjev 
• 
If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). 
If the pen is damaged in any way, do not use.  
• 
• 
Getting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see instructions for use) 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
Use a new needle. (Needles are not included). 
Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air 
bubbles from your KwikPen. There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen. Small air 
bubbles are normal and will not affect your dose. 
The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. 
• 
• 
• 
Injecting Lyumjev  
• 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin.  
Inject under the skin (subcutaneous injection), as you were taught by your physician or nurse.  
112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full 
dose. Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places 
you inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen). 
If you do not have enough insulin in the pen to complete your dose, make a note of how much 
you still need to take. Prime a new pen and inject the remaining dose. 
If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. 
Do not inject directly into a vein.  
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer 
needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering the pen 
and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the cap 
on your pen. 
If you are unsure how much you have injected then check your blood sugar levels before 
deciding if you need another injection. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear any air 
bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle pointing 
up.  
Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it again. 
• 
• 
If you use more Lyumjev than you should 
If you inject too much Lyumjev, or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar may 
occur. Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or 
drink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you 
and have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check 
your blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. 
If you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, 
have difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. 
This can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If 
glucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to 
tell you about glucagon. 
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical 
help straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
If you forget to use Lyumjev 
If you forget to use your insulin or you use less than you should, or are unsure how much you have 
injected, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide 
if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your usual dosing schedule at your next meal. 
If you stop using Lyumjev 
Do not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you use less Lyumjev than you 
should, a high blood sugar may occur. 
If high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4).  
Three simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
Always keep a spare pen in case you lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. 
113 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 
under ‘If you use more Lyumjev than you should’. 
Allergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may 
include the following symptoms: 
•  rash over the whole body  
•  difficulty in breathing  
•  wheezing 
•  blood pressure dropping  
•  heart beating fast  
•  sweating 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight 
away. 
Other side effects include 
Common  
Injection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the 
insulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop 
Lyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
the build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very well 
if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin 
changes. 
Other potential side effects 
Swelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema) particularly at the start of insulin therapy or 
during a change in your diabetes medicines. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
Low blood sugar  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; 
114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble 
with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
See section “If you use more Lyumjev than you should”. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
rapid heart beat 
nervousness or shakiness 
feeling sick 
headache 
cold sweat 
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too 
high. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your insulin; 
using less insulin than your body needs; 
an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
The early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  
• 
• 
• 
• 
being very thirsty  
headache  
feeling sleepy 
urinating more often 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
nausea and/or vomiting 
abdominal pain 
rapid pulse 
heavy breathing 
moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for 
energy instead of glucose. 
If you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. 
See section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. 
Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.

Instructions for Use 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
insulin lispro 
PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE 
Read the instructions for use before you start taking Lyumjev and each time you get another Lyumjev 
KwikPen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your 
healthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. 
Do not share your Lyumjev KwikPen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do 
not reuse or share needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection or 
get a serious infection from them. 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL KwikPen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 mL (300 units, 
100 units/mL) of insulin lispro solution for injection.  
• 
Your healthcare professional will tell you how many units to give as your dose and how to 
inject your prescribed dose of insulin. 
You can give yourself more than 1 dose from the Pen.  
Each turn of the dose knob dials 1 unit of insulin. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single 
injection. 
If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself more than 1 injection. Always 
check the number in the dose window to make sure you dialed the correct dose. 
The plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The 
plunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 300 units in the Pen. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
People who are blind or have vision problems should not use the Pen without help from a person 
trained to use the Pen.

• 
KwikPen compatible needle (BD [Becton, Dickinson and Company] Pen needles 
recommended) 
Swab or gauze 
Preparing your Pen 
• 
Wash your hands with soap and water. 
• 
• 
• 
Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important 
if you use more than 1 type of insulin. 
Do not use your Pen past the expiry date printed on the label or for more than 28 days after you 
first start using the Pen. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked needles.  
Step 1: 
• 
Pull the Pen cap straight off. 
–  Do not remove the Pen label. 
• 
Wipe the rubber seal with a swab. 
Step 2: 
• 
Check the liquid in the Pen. 
• 
Lyumjev should look clear and colourless. 
Do not use if it is cloudy, coloured, or has 
particles or clumps in it.

Step 3: 
• 
Select a new needle. 
• 
Pull off the paper tab from the outer needle 
shield. 
Step 4: 
• 
Push the capped needle straight onto the Pen 
and twist the needle on until it is tight.

Priming your Pen 
Prime before each injection. 
• 
Priming your Pen means removing the air from the needle and cartridge that may collect during 
normal use and ensures that your Pen is working correctly. 
• 
If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. 
Step 6: 
• 
To prime your Pen, turn the dose knob to 
select 2 units. 
Step 7: 
• 
Hold your Pen with the needle pointing up. 
Tap the cartridge holder gently to collect air 
bubbles at the top. 
Step 8: 
• 
Continue holding your Pen with the needle 
pointing up. Push the dose knob in until it 
stops and “0” is seen in the dose window. 
Hold the dose knob in and count to 5 slowly. 
You should see insulin at the tip of the needle. 
–  If you do not see insulin, repeat priming 
steps 6 to 8, but not more than 4 times. 
121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
–  If you still do not see insulin, change the 
needle and repeat priming steps 6 to 8. 
Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your 
dose. 
Selecting your dose 
• 
You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. 
• 
If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than 1 injection. 
–  If you need help with dividing up your dose the right way, ask your healthcare professional. 
–  Use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps. 
Step 9: 
• 
Turn the dose knob to select the number of 
units you need to inject. The dose indicator 
should line up with your dose. 
–  The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. 
–  The dose knob clicks as you turn it. 
–  Do not dial your dose by counting the 
clicks. You may dial the wrong dose. This 
may lead to getting too much insulin or 
not enough insulin. 
–  The dose can be corrected by turning the 
dose knob in either direction until the 
correct dose lines up with the dose 
indicator. 
–  The even numbers are printed on the dial. 
The example to the right shows 12 units. 
–  The odd numbers, after the number 1, are 
shown as full lines between the numbers. 
The example to the right shows 25 units. 
Example: 12 units 
shown in the dose 
window 
• 
Always check the number in the dose 
window to make sure you have dialed the 
correct dose. 
Example: 25 units 
shown in the dose 
window 
• 
• 
The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. 
If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: 
–  inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, 
or 
–  get a new Pen and inject the full dose. 
• 
It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. 
122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Giving your injection 
• 
Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. 
• 
• 
Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. 
Do not try to change your dose while injecting. 
Step 10: 
• 
Choose your injection site. 
Lyumjev is injected under the skin 
(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, 
buttocks, upper legs or upper arms. 
• 
Wipe your skin with a swab, and let your 
skin dry before you inject your dose. 
Step 11: 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin. 
• 
• 
Push the dose knob all the way in. 
Continue to hold the dose 
knob in and slowly count 
to 5 before removing the 
needle. 
5 sec 
Do not try to inject your insulin by turning the 
dose knob. You will not receive your insulin 
by turning the dose knob. 
123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 12: 
• 
Pull the needle out of your skin. 
–  A drop of insulin at the needle tip is 
normal. It will not affect your dose. 
• 
Check the number in the dose window. 
–  If you see “0” in the dose window, you 
have received the full amount you dialed. 
–  If you do not see “0” in the dose window, 
you did not receive your full dose. Do not 
redial. Insert the needle into your skin and 
finish your injection. 
–  If you still do not think you received the 
full amount you dialed for your injection, 
do not start over or repeat that injection. 
Monitor your blood glucose as instructed 
by your healthcare professional. 
–  If you normally need to give 2 injections 
for your full dose, be sure to give your 
second injection. 
The plunger only moves a little with each injection, 
and you may not notice that it moves. 
If you see blood after you take the needle out of your 
skin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of 
gauze or a swab. Do not rub the area. 
After your injection 
Step 13: 
• 
Carefully replace the outer needle shield. 
Step 14: 
• 
Unscrew the capped needle and dispose of it as 
described below (see Disposing of Pens and 
needles section). 
• 
Do not store the Pen with the needle attached 
to prevent leaking, blocking the needle, and air 
from entering the Pen. 
Step 15: 
• 
Replace the Pen cap by lining up the cap clip 
with the dose indicator and pushing straight 
on. 
124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disposing of Pens and needles 
•  
Put used needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw 
needles directly into your household waste. 
•  
•  
•  
Do not recycle the filled sharps container. 
Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container 
properly. 
The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare 
professional or institutional policies. 
Troubleshooting 
• 
If you cannot remove the Pen cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap 
straight off. 
• 
– 
– 
– 
If the dose knob is hard to push: 
pushing the dose knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. 
your needle may be blocked. Put on a new needle and prime the Pen. 
you may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. 
If you have any questions or problems with your Lyumjev 100 units/mL KwikPen, call your 
healthcare professional for help or contact your local Lilly affiliate.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Lyumjev Junior KwikPen is and what it is used for 
Lyumjev 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen contains the active 
ingredient insulin lispro. Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children 
aged 1 year and above. It is a mealtime insulin that works more quickly than other medicines 
containing insulin lispro. Lyumjev contains ingredients that speed up absorption of insulin lispro into 
the body. 
Diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin 
effectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin 
medicinethat is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of 
diabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. 
Treatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from 
your diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up 
to 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not 
change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  
Lyumjev 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 
100 units/ml) of insulin lispro. One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin. The KwikPen dials 
half unit (0.5 unit) at a time. The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check 
this before your injection. You can give from 0.5 unit to 30 units in a single injection. If your dose is 
more than 30 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  
126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 
What you need to know before you use Lyumjev Junior KwikPen   
Do NOT use Lyumjev Junior KwikPen  
• 
if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on this leaflet tells you how 
to deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you use more Lyumjev than you should”). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. 
If you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  
• 
Low blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  
Lyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia 
occurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia 
or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar 
levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may 
not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later 
in this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. 
You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. 
You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. 
Making changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  
It may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood 
sugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicines.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   
• 
Stopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic 
ketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common 
problems of diabetes”. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicines called 
thiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you 
get signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). 
If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using 
this medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. 
Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from 
your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. 
Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you 
can then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side 
effects”. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a 
needle is blocked replace it with a new needle. 
Skin changes at the injection site. 
• 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Lyumjev Junior KwikPen). Contact 
your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting into a different 
area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or 
your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year. 
Other medicines and Lyumjev 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change. 
Your blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) 
acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) 
some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) 
some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for 
some heart problems or high blood pressure) 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) 
somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving 
too much growth hormone) 
Your blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol (for endometriosis)  
the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) 
thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) 
human growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency) 
diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body) 
sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  
corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) 
Beta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the 
warning signs of low blood sugar.  
Lyumjev with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you 
need usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. 
After you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed 
before your pregnancy.  
There are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, 
you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lyumjev Junior KwikPen contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Lyumjev Junior KwikPen  
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has 
told you. Check with them if you are not sure.  
They will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will 
also tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, even if the needle 
is changed. 
You should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. 
If you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to  make your injections. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject 
them separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. 
When to inject Lyumjev 
Lyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two 
before the meal; you also have the option to inject  up to 20 minutes after starting the meal.  
How much insulin to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  
• 
• 
• 
•  What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are 
How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. 
How and when to check your blood sugar level. 
How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. 
• 
using other medicines. 
If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This 
might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Do not use Lyumjev 
• 
If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). 
If the pen is damaged in any way, do not use.  
• 
• 
Getting the Lyumjev Junior KwikPen ready to use (Please see instructions for use) 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
Use a new needle. (Needles are not included). 
Prime your Lyumjev Junior KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and 
clears the air bubbles from your Lyumjev Junior KwikPen. There may still be some small air 
bubbles left in the pen. Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your dose. 
The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. 
• 
• 
• 
Injecting Lyumjev  
• 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin.  
Inject under the skin (subcutaneous injection), as you were taught by your physician or nurse.  
129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full 
dose. Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places 
you inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen).  
If you do not have enough insulin in the pen to complete your dose, make a note of how much 
you still need to take.  Prime a new pen and inject the remaining dose. 
If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. 
Do not inject directly into a vein.  
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the Lyumjev Junior KwikPen 
using the outer needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air 
entering the pen and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your 
pen. Replace the cap on your pen. 
If you are unsure how much you have injected then check your blood sugar levels before 
deciding if you need another injection. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you use a Lyumjev Junior KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every 
injection, clear any air bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the Lyumjev 
Junior KwikPen with the needle pointing up.  
Once the Lyumjev Junior KwikPen is empty, do not use it again.  
• 
• 
If you use more Lyumjev than you should 
If you inject too much Lyumjev, or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar may 
occur. Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or 
drink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you 
and have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check 
your blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. 
If you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, 
have difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. 
This can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If 
glucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to 
tell you about glucagon. 
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical 
help straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
If you forget to use Lyumjev 
If you forget to use your insulin or you use less than you should, or are unsure how much you have 
injected, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide 
if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your usual dosing schedule at your next meal. 
If you stop using Lyumjev 
Do not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you use less Lyumjev than you 
should, a high blood sugar may occur. 
If high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4).  
Three simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
Always keep a spare pen in case you lose your Lyumjev Junior KwikPen or it gets damaged. 
130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 
under ‘If you use more Lyumjev than you should’. 
Allergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may 
include the following symptoms: 
•  rash over the whole body  
•  difficulty in breathing  
•  wheezing 
•  blood pressure dropping  
•  heart beating fast  
•  sweating 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight 
away. 
Other side effects include 
Common  
Injection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the 
insulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop 
Lyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
the build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very well 
if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin 
changes. 
Other potential side effects 
Swelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema) particularly at the start of insulin therapy or 
during a change in your diabetes medicines. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
Low blood sugar  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; 
131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
• 
• 
• 
there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble with 
your kidneys or liver which gets worse.See section ‘If you use more Lyumjev than you should.’ 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
rapid heart beat 
nervousness or shakiness 
feeling sick 
headache 
cold sweat 
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too 
high. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your insulin; 
using less insulin than your body needs; 
an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
The early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  
• 
• 
• 
• 
being very thirsty  
headache  
feeling sleepy 
urinating more often 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
nausea and/or vomiting 
abdominal pain 
rapid pulse 
heavy breathing 
moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for 
energy instead of glucose. 
If you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. 
See section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. 
Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.

Instructions for Use 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL Junior KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
insulin lispro 
PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE 
Read the instructions for use before you start taking Lyumjev and each time you get another Lyumjev 
Junior KwikPen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to 
your healthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. 
Do not share your Lyumjev Junior KwikPen with other people, even if the needle has been 
changed. Do not reuse or share needles with other people. You may give other people a serious 
infection or get a serious infection from them. 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL Junior KwikPen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 mL 
(300 units, 100 units/mL) of insulin lispro solution for injection.  
• 
Your healthcare professional will tell you how many units to give as your dose and how to 
inject your prescribed dose of insulin. 
You can give yourself more than 1 dose from the Pen.  
Each turn of the dose knob dials half (0.5 unit) of insulin. You can give from half (0.5 unit) to 
30 units in a single injection. 
If your dose is more than 30 units, you will need to give yourself more than 1 injection. Always 
check the number in the dose window to make sure you dialed the correct dose. 
The plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The 
plunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 300 units in the Pen. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
People who are blind or have vision problems should not use the Pen without help from a person 
trained to use the Pen.

Supplies needed to give your injection 
Lyumjev Junior KwikPen 
• 
• 
• 
KwikPen compatible needle (BD [Becton, Dickinson and Company] Pen needles 
recommended) 
Swab or gauze 
Preparing your Pen 
• 
Wash your hands with soap and water. 
• 
• 
• 
Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important 
if you use more than 1 type of insulin. 
Do not use your Pen past the expiry date printed on the label or for more than 28 days after you 
first start using the Pen. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked needles.  
Step 1: 
• 
Pull the Pen cap straight off. 
–  Do not remove the Pen label. 
• 
Wipe the rubber seal with a swab. 
Step 2: 
• 
Check the liquid in the Pen. 
• 
Lyumjev should look clear and colourless. 
Do not use if it is cloudy, coloured, or has 
particles or clumps in it. 
137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3: 
• 
Select a new needle. 
• 
Pull off the paper tab from the outer needle 
shield. 
Step 4: 
• 
Push the capped needle straight onto the Pen 
and twist the needle on until it is tight. 
Step 5: 
• 
Pull off the outer needle shield. Do not throw 
it away. 
• 
Pull off the inner needle shield and throw it 
away. 
Keep 
Throw 
Away 
Priming your Pen 
Prime before each injection. 
• 
Priming your Pen means removing the air from the needle and cartridge that may collect during 
normal use and ensures that your Pen is working correctly.  
• 
If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. 
Step 6: 
• 
To prime your Pen, turn the dose knob to 
select 2 units. 
Step 7: 
• 
Hold your Pen with the needle pointing up. 
Tap the cartridge holder gently to collect air 
bubbles at the top. 
Step 8: 
• 
Continue holding your Pen with the needle 
pointing up. Push the dose knob in until it 
stops and “0” is seen in the dose window. 
Hold the dose knob in and count to 5 slowly. 
You should see insulin at the tip of the needle. 
–  If you do not see insulin, repeat priming steps 
6 to 8, but not more than 4 times. 
138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
–  If you still do not see insulin, change the 
needle and repeat priming steps 6 to 8. 
Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your 
dose. 
Selecting your dose 
• 
You can give from half unit (0.5 unit) to 30 units in a single injection. 
• 
If your dose is more than 30 units, you will need to give more than 1 injection. 
–  If you need help with dividing up your dose the right way, ask your healthcare professional. 
–  Use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps. 
–  If you usually need more than 30 units, ask your healthcare professional if a different 
Lyumjev KwikPen would be better for you. 
139 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 9: 
• 
Turn the dose knob to select the number of 
units you need to inject. The dose indicator 
should line up with your dose. 
–  The Pen dials half unit (0.5 unit) at a time. 
–  The dose knob clicks as you turn it. 
–  Do not dial your dose by counting the 
clicks. You may dial the wrong dose. This 
may lead to getting too much insulin or 
not enough insulin. 
–  The dose can be corrected by turning the 
dose knob in either direction until the 
correct dose lines up with the dose 
indicator. 
–  The whole unit numbers are printed on the 
dial. The example to the right shows 
4 units. 
–  The half units are shown as lines between 
the whole unit numbers. The example to 
the right shows 10.5 units. 
• 
Always check the number in the dose 
window to make sure you have dialed the 
correct dose. 
Example: 4 units 
shown in the dose 
window 
Example: 10 ½ (10.5) 
units shown in the dose 
window 
• 
• 
The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. 
If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: 
–  inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, 
or 
–  get a new Pen and inject the full dose. 
• 
It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. 
Giving your injection 
• 
Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. 
• 
• 
Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. 
Do not try to change your dose while injecting. 
140 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 10: 
• 
Choose your injection site. 
Lyumjev is injected under the skin 
(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, 
buttocks, upper legs or upper arms. 
• 
Wipe your skin with a swab, and let your 
skin dry before you inject your dose. 
Step 11: 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin. 
• 
• 
Push the dose knob all the way in. 
Continue to hold the dose 
knob in and slowly count 
to 5 before removing the 
needle. 
5 sec 
Do not try to inject your insulin by turning the 
dose knob. You will not receive your insulin by 
turning the dose knob. 
141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 12: 
• 
Pull the needle out of your skin. 
–  A drop of insulin at the needle tip is 
normal. It will not affect your dose. 
• 
Check the number in the dose window. 
–  If you see “0” in the dose window, 
you have received the full amount 
you dialed. 
–  If you do not see “0” in the dose 
window, you did not receive your 
full dose. Do not redial. Insert the 
needle into your skin and finish 
your injection. 
–  If you still do not think you 
received the full amount you dialed 
for your injection, do not start over 
or repeat that injection. Monitor 
your blood glucose as instructed by 
your healthcare professional. 
–  If you normally need to give 
2 injections for your full dose, be 
sure to give your second injection. 
The plunger only moves a little with each 
injection, and you may not notice that it 
moves. 
If you see blood after you take the needle out 
of your skin, press the injection site lightly 
with a piece of gauze or a swab. Do not rub 
the area. 
142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After your injection 
Step 13: 
• 
Carefully replace the outer needle shield. 
Step 14: 
• 
Unscrew the capped needle and dispose of it 
as described below (see Disposing of Pens 
and needles section). 
• 
Do not store the Pen with the needle attached 
to prevent leaking, blocking the needle, and 
air from entering the Pen. 
Step 15: 
• 
Replace the Pen cap by lining up the cap clip 
with the dose indicator and pushing straight 
on. 
Disposing of Pens and needles 
•  
Put used needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw 
needles directly into your household waste. 
•  
•  
•  
Do not recycle the filled sharps container. 
Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container 
properly. 
The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare 
professional or institutional policies. 
Troubleshooting 
• 
If you cannot remove the Pen cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap 
straight off. 
• 
If the dose knob is hard to push: 
–  pushing the dose knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. 
–  your needle may be blocked. Put on a new needle and prime the Pen. 
–  you may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Lyumjev Tempo Pen is and what it is used for 
Lyumjev 100 units/ml Tempo Pen solution for injection in pre-filled pen contains the active ingredient 
insulin lispro. Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 
1 year and above. It is a mealtime insulin that works more quickly than other medicines containing 
insulin lispro. Lyumjev contains ingredients that speed up absorption of insulin lispro into the body. 
Diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin 
effectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin 
medicine that is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of 
diabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. 
Treatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from 
your diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up 
to 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not 
change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  
The Lyumjev 100 units/ml Tempo Pen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, 
100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  One Tempo Pen contains multiple doses of insulin. The Tempo Pen 
dials 1 unit at a time. The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this 
before your injection. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose is more 
than 60 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.

2. 
What you need to know before you use Lyumjev Tempo Pen 
Do NOT use Lyumjev Tempo Pen  
• 
if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on, this leaflet tells you 
how to deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you use more Lyumjev than you 
should”). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. 
If you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  
• 
Low blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  
Lyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia 
occurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia 
or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar 
levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may 
not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later 
in this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. 
You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. 
You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. 
Making changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  
It may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood 
sugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicines.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   
• 
Stopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic 
ketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common 
problems of diabetes”. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicines called 
thiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you 
get signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). 
If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using 
this medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. 
Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from 
your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. 
Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you 
can then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side 
effects”. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles. If a 
needle is blocked replace it with a new needle. 
Skin changes at the injection site. 
• 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Lyumjev Tempo Pen). Contact 
your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting into a different 
area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or 
your other antidiabetic medications dose.

The Tempo Pen contains a magnet. If you have a medical device fitted, such as a heart pacemaker, this 
may not work correctly if the Tempo Pen is held too close. The magnetic field extends to 
approximately 1.5 cm. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for use in children below the age of 1 year.  
Other medicines and Lyumjev 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change. 
Your blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) 
acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) 
some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) 
some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for 
some heart problems or high blood pressure) 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) 
somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving 
too much growth hormone) 
Your blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol (for endometriosis)  
the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) 
thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) 
human growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency) 
diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body)  
sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  
corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) 
Beta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the 
warning signs of low blood sugar.  
Lyumjev with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you 
need usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. 
After you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed 
before your pregnancy.  
There are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, 
you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Lyumjev Tempo Pen contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Lyumjev Tempo Pen 
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has 
told you. Check with them if you are not sure.  
They will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will 
also tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, even if the needle 
is changed. 
You should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. 
If you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to  make your injections. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject 
them separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. 
The Tempo Pen is designed to work with the Tempo Smart Button. The optional additional feature 
Tempo Smart Button is a product available for the Tempo Pen, which may be used for transmitting 
dose information to a mobile application. The Tempo Pen can be used with or without the Tempo 
Smart Button attached. See instructions provided with the Tempo Smart Button and the mobile 
application for further information.  
When to inject Lyumjev 
Lyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two 
before the meal; you also have the option to inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. 
 How much insulin to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  
• 
• 
• 
•  What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are 
How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. 
How and when to check your blood sugar level.  
How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. 
• 
using other medicines. 
If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This 
might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Do not use Lyumjev 
• 
If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). 
If the pen is damaged in any way, do not use.  
• 
• 
Getting the Tempo Pen ready to use (Please see instructions for use) 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
Use a new needle. (Needles are not included). 
• 
147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Prime your Tempo Pen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air 
bubbles from your Tempo Pen. There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen. Small 
air bubbles are normal and will not affect your dose. 
The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. 
Injecting Lyumjev  
• 
• 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin.  
Inject under the skin (subcutaneous injection), as you were taught by your physician or nurse.  
After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full 
dose. Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places 
you inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen). 
If you do not have enough insulin in the pen to complete your dose, make a note of how much 
you still need to take. Prime a new pen and inject the remaining dose. 
If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. 
Do not inject directly into a vein.  
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the Tempo Pen using the outer 
needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering the pen 
and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the cap 
on your pen. 
If you are unsure how much you have injected then check your blood sugar levels before 
deciding if you need another injection. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you use a Tempo Pen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear any 
air bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the Tempo Pen with the needle 
pointing up.  
Once the Tempo Pen is empty, do not use it again. 
If you use more Lyumjev than you should 
If you inject too much Lyumjev, or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar may 
occur. Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or 
drink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you 
and have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check 
your blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. 
If you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, 
have difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. 
This can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If 
glucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to 
tell you about glucagon. 
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical 
help straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
If you forget to use Lyumjev 
If you forget to use your insulin, or you use less than you should, or are unsure how much you have 
injected, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide 
if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your usual dosing schedule at your next meal. 
148 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you stop using Lyumjev 
Do not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you use less Lyumjev than you 
should, a high blood sugar may occur. 
If high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4).  
Three simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
• 
• 
Always keep a spare pen in case you lose your Tempo Pen or it gets damaged. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 
under ‘If you use more Lyumjev than you should’. 
Allergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may 
include the following symptoms: 
•  rash over the whole body  
•  difficulty in breathing  
•  wheezing 
•  blood pressure dropping  
•  heart beating fast  
•  sweating 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight 
away. 
Other side effects include 
Common  
Injection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the 
insulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop 
Lyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
the build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very well 
if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin 
changes. 
Other potential side effects 
Swelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema) particularly at the start of insulin therapy or 
during a change in your diabetes medicines. 
149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
Low blood sugar  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble 
with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
See section “If you use more Lyumjev than you should”. 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
rapid heart beat 
nervousness or shakiness 
feeling sick 
headache 
cold sweat 
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too 
high. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your insulin; 
using less insulin than your body needs; 
an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
The early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  
• 
• 
• 
• 
being very thirsty  
headache  
feeling sleepy 
urinating more often 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
nausea and/or vomiting 
abdominal pain 
rapid pulse 
heavy breathing 
moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for 
energy instead of glucose. 
If you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. 
See section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. 
150 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.

Instructions for Use 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL Tempo Pen solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
insulin lispro 
PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE 
Read the instructions for use before you start using Lyumjev and each time you get another Lyumjev 
Tempo Pen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to 
your healthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. 
Lyumjev 100 units/mL Tempo Pen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 mL (300 units, 
100 units/mL) of insulin lispro solution for injection.  
• 
Your healthcare professional will tell you how many units to give as your dose and how to 
inject your prescribed dose of insulin. 
You can give yourself more than 1 dose from the Pen.  
Each turn of the dose knob dials 1 unit of insulin. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single 
injection. 
If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself more than 1 injection. Always 
check the number in the dose window to make sure you dialed the correct dose. 
The plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The 
plunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 300 units in the Pen. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The Tempo Pen is designed to work with the Tempo Smart Button. The Tempo Smart Button is an 
optional product that can be attached to the Tempo Pen dose knob and aids in transmitting Lyumjev 
dose information from the Tempo Pen to a compatible mobile application. The Tempo Pen injects 
insulin with or without the Tempo Smart Button attached. Your Tempo Smart Button must be attached 
to a Tempo Pen to record or transfer dose data. Push the Tempo Smart Button straight down on the 
dose knob until you hear a snap or feel the Tempo Smart Button snap into place. To transmit data to 
the mobile application, follow the instructions provided with the Tempo Smart Button and the 
instructions with the mobile application. 
Do not share your Lyumjev Tempo Pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. 
Do not reuse or share needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection 
or get a serious infection from them. 
People who are blind or have vision problems should not use the Pen without help from a person 
trained to use the Pen.

Priming your Pen 
Prime before each injection. 
• 
Priming your Pen means removing the air from the needle and cartridge that may collect during 
normal use and ensures that your Pen is working correctly. 
• 
If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. 
Step 6: 
• 
To prime your Pen, turn the dose knob to 
select 2 units. 
Step 7: 
• 
Hold your Pen with the needle pointing up. 
Tap the cartridge holder gently to collect air 
bubbles at the top. 
Step 8: 
• 
Continue holding your Pen with the needle 
pointing up. Push the dose knob in until it 
stops and “0” is seen in the dose window. 
Hold the dose knob in and count to 5 slowly. 
You should see insulin at the tip of the needle. 
–  If you do not see insulin, repeat priming 
steps 6 to 8, but not more than 4 times. 
156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
–  If you still do not see insulin, change the 
needle and repeat priming steps 6 to 8. 
Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your 
dose. 
Selecting your dose 
• 
You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. 
• 
If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than 1 injection. 
–  If you need help with dividing up your dose the right way, ask your healthcare professional. 
–  Use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps. 
Step 9: 
• 
Turn the dose knob to select the number of 
units you need to inject. The dose indicator 
should line up with your dose. 
–  The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. 
–  The dose knob clicks as you turn it. 
–  Do not dial your dose by counting the 
clicks. You may dial the wrong dose. This 
may lead to getting too much insulin or 
not enough insulin. 
–  The dose can be corrected by turning the 
dose knob in either direction until the 
correct dose lines up with the dose 
indicator. 
–  The even numbers are printed on the dial. 
The example to the right shows 12 units. 
–  The odd numbers, after the number 1, are 
shown as full lines between the numbers. 
The example to the right shows 25 units. 
• 
Always check the number in the dose 
window to make sure you have dialed the 
correct dose. 
Example: 12 units 
shown in the dose 
window 
Example: 25 units 
shown in the dose 
window 
• 
• 
The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. 
If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: 
–  inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, 
or 
–  get a new Pen and inject the full dose. 
157 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. 
Giving your injection 
• 
Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. 
• 
• 
Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. 
Do not try to change your dose while injecting. 
Step 10: 
• 
Choose your injection site. 
Lyumjev is injected under the skin 
(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, 
buttocks, upper legs or upper arms. 
• 
Wipe your skin with a swab, and let your 
skin dry before you inject your dose. 
Step 11: 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin. 
• 
• 
Push the dose knob all the way in. 
Continue to hold the dose 
knob in and slowly count 
to 5 before removing the 
needle. 
5 sec 
Do not try to inject your insulin by turning the 
dose knob. You will not receive your insulin by 
turning the dose knob. 
158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 12: 
• 
Pull the needle out of your skin. 
–  A drop of insulin at the needle tip is 
normal. It will not affect your dose. 
• 
Check the number in the dose window. 
–  If you see “0” in the dose window, you 
have received the full amount you dialed. 
–  If you do not see “0” in the dose window, 
you did not receive your full dose. Do not 
redial. Insert the needle into your skin and 
finish your injection. 
–  If you still do not think you received the 
full amount you dialed for your injection, 
do not start over or repeat that injection. 
Monitor your blood glucose as instructed 
by your healthcare professional. 
–  If you normally need to give 2 injections 
for your full dose, be sure to give your 
second injection. 
The plunger only moves a little with each injection, 
and you may not notice that it moves. 
If you see blood after you take the needle out of your 
skin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of 
gauze or a swab. Do not rub the area. 
After your injection 
Step 13: 
• 
Carefully replace the outer needle shield. 
Step 14: 
• 
Unscrew the capped needle and dispose of it as 
described below (see Disposing of Pens and 
needles section). 
• 
Do not store the Pen with the needle attached 
to prevent leaking, blocking the needle, and air 
from entering the Pen. 
Step 15: 
• 
Replace the Pen cap by lining up the cap clip 
with the dose indicator and pushing straight 
on. 
159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disposing of Pens and needles 
•  
Put used needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw 
needles directly into your household waste. 
•  
•  
•  
Do not recycle the filled sharps container. 
Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container 
properly. 
The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare 
professional or institutional policies. 
Troubleshooting 
• 
If you cannot remove the Pen cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap 
straight off. 
• 
– 
– 
– 
If the dose knob is hard to push: 
pushing the dose knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. 
your needle may be blocked. Put on a new needle and prime the Pen. 
you may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. You 
may need to get a prescription from your healthcare professional. 
If you have any questions or problems with your Lyumjev 100 units/mL Tempo Pen, call your 
healthcare professional for help or contact your local Lilly affiliate.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen is and what it is used for 
Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen contains the active ingredient 
insulin lispro. Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes in adults. It is a mealtime insulin that works more 
quickly than other medicines containing insulin lispro. Lyumjev contains ingredients that speed up 
absorption of insulin lispro into the body. 
Diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin 
effectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin 
medicinethat is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of 
diabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. 
Treatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from 
your diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up 
to 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the 
meal. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not 
change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  
Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (600 units, 
200 units/ml) of insulin lispro. One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin. The KwikPen dials 
1 unit at a time. The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before 
your injection. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose is more than 
60 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  
161 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen 
Do NOT use Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen  
• 
if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on this leaflet tells you how 
to deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you use more Lyumjev than you should”). 
if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
• 
The Lyumjev 200 units/ml solution for injection in your pre-filled pen (the KwikPen) 
should ONLY be injected with this pre-filled pen. Do not transfer the insulin lispro from 
your Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will 
not measure your dose correctly. A severe overdose can result, causing low blood sugar which 
may put your life in danger. Do not transfer insulin from your Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen 
to any other insulin delivery devices like insulin infusion pumps. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. 
If you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  
• 
Low blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  
Lyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia 
occurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia 
or have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar 
levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may 
not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later 
in this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. 
You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. 
You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. 
Making changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  
It may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood 
sugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicines.  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   
• 
Stopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic 
ketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common 
problems of diabetes”. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicines called 
thiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you 
get signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). 
If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using 
this medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. 
Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from 
your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. 
Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you 
can then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side 
effects”. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a 
needle is blocked replace it with a new needle. 
162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin changes at the injection site. 
• 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen). 
Contact your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting into a 
different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your 
insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this 
medicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Lyumjev 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to 
change. 
Your blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  
sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) 
acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) 
some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) 
some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for 
some heart problems or high blood pressure) 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) 
somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving 
too much growth hormone) 
Your blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol (for endometriosis)  
the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) 
thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) 
human growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency) 
diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body) 
sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  
corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) 
Beta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the 
warning signs of low blood sugar.  
Lyumjev with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin 
needed may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you 
need usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. 
After you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed 
before your pregnancy.  
There are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, 
you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. 
163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this 
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving 
a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: 
• 
• 
frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia 
Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen 
Always use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has 
told you. Check with them if you are not sure.  
They will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will 
also tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, even if the needle 
is changed. 
Do not use Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in an insulin infusion pump. 
You should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. 
If you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to  make your injections. 
Your doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject 
them separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. 
When to inject Lyumjev 
Lyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two 
before the meal; you also have the option to inject  up to 20 minutes after starting the meal.  
How much insulin to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  
• 
• 
• 
•  What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are 
How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. 
How and when to check your blood sugar level. 
How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. 
• 
using other medicines. 
If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This 
might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  
Do not use Lyumjev 
• 
If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. 
Check each time you inject yourself. 
If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). 
If the pen is damaged in any way, do not use.  
• 
• 
Getting the Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen ready to use (Please see instructions for use) 
• 
• 
First wash your hands. 
Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions 
carefully. Here are some reminders. 
164 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Use a new needle. (Needles are not included). 
Prime your Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out 
and clears the air bubbles from your Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen. There may still be some 
small air bubbles left in the pen. Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your dose. 
The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. 
Injecting Lyumjev  
• 
• 
• 
Before you make an injection, clean your skin.  
Inject under the skin (subcutaneous injection), as you were taught by your physician or nurse.  
After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full 
dose. Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places 
you inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen).  
If you do not have enough insulin in the pen to complete your dose, make a note of how much 
you still need to take.  Prime a new pen and inject the remaining dose. 
If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. 
Do not inject directly into a vein.  
After injecting 
• 
As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the Lyumjev 200 units/ml 
KwikPen using the outer needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also 
stops air entering the pen and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share 
your pen. Replace the cap on your pen. 
If you are unsure how much you have injected then check your blood sugar levels before 
deciding if you need another injection. 
Further injections 
• 
Every time you use a Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every 
injection, clear any air bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the Lyumjev 
200 units/ml KwikPen with the needle pointing up.  
Once the Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen is empty, do not use it again.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you use more Lyumjev than you should 
If you inject too much Lyumjev, or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar may 
occur. Check your blood sugar.  
If your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or 
drink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you 
and have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check 
your blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. 
If you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, 
have difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. 
This can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If 
glucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to 
tell you about glucagon. 
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical 
help straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  
If you forget to use Lyumjev 
If you forget to use your insulin or you use less than you should, or are unsure how much you have 
injected, your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide 
if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your usual dosing schedule at your next meal. 
165 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you stop using Lyumjev 
Do not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you use less Lyumjev than you 
should, a high blood sugar may occur. 
If high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4).  
Three simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: 
• 
Always keep a spare pen in case you lose your Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen or it gets 
damaged. 
Always carry something to show you are diabetic. 
Always carry sugar with you. 
• 
• 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 
10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become 
unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you 
have symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 
under ‘If you use more Lyumjev than you should’. 
Allergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may 
include the following symptoms: 
•  rash over the whole body  
•  difficulty in breathing  
•  wheezing 
•  blood pressure dropping  
•  heart beating fast  
•  sweating 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the 
ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight 
away. 
Other side effects include 
Common  
Injection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the 
insulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop 
Lyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue may 
either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
the build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very well 
if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin 
changes. 
Other potential side effects 
Swelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema) particularly at the start of insulin therapy or 
during a change in your diabetes medicines. 
166 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
Common problems of diabetes 
Low blood sugar  
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; 
you miss or delay meals or change your diet; 
you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; 
you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); 
there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble 
with your kidneys or liver which gets worse. 
See section ‘If you use more Lyumjev than you should’ 
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tiredness 
rapid heart beat 
nervousness or shakiness 
feeling sick 
headache 
cold sweat 
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a 
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis 
Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too 
high. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
not taking your insulin; 
using less insulin than your body needs; 
an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or 
fever, infection or emotional stress. 
The early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  
• 
• 
• 
• 
being very thirsty  
headache  
feeling sleepy 
urinating more often 
Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many 
hours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
nausea and/or vomiting 
abdominal pain 
rapid pulse 
heavy breathing 
moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for 
energy instead of glucose. 
If you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. 
See section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. 
167 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Illness 
If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even 
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your 
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.

Instructions for Use 
Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
insulin lispro 
PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE 
USE ONLY IN THIS PEN, OR SEVERE 
OVERDOSE CAN RESULT 
Read the instructions for use before you start taking Lyumjev and each time you get another Lyumjev 
KwikPen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your 
healthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. 
Do not share your Lyumjev KwikPen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do 
not reuse or share needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection or 
get a serious infection from them. 
Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 mL (600 units, 
200 units/mL) of insulin lispro solution for injection.  
• 
Your healthcare professional will tell you how many units to give as your dose and how to 
inject your prescribed dose of insulin. 
You can give yourself more than 1 dose from the Pen.  
Each turn of the dose knob dials 1 unit of insulin. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single 
injection. 
If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself more than 1 injection. Always 
check the number in the dose window to make sure you dialed the correct dose. 
The plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The 
plunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 600 units in the Pen. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
This Pen is designed to allow you to give more doses than other pens you may have used in the 
past. Dial your usual dose as instructed by your healthcare professional. 
Lyumjev KwikPen is available in two strengths, 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL. Inject Lyumjev 
200 units/mL only with your Pen. Do not transfer insulin from your Pen to another insulin 
delivery device. Syringes and insulin pumps will not measure 200 units/mL of insulin correctly. 
A severe overdose can result, causing very low blood sugar which may put your life in danger. 
People who are blind or have vision problems should not use the Pen without help from a person 
trained to use the Pen.

• 
Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important 
if you use more than 1 type of insulin.

first start using the Pen.

• 
Pull the Pen cap straight off. 
–  Do not remove the Pen label. 
• 
Wipe the rubber seal with a swab. 
Step 2: 
• 
Check the liquid in the Pen.  
• 
Lyumjev should look clear and colourless. 
Do not use if it is cloudy, coloured, or has 
particles or clumps in it. 
Step 3: 
• 
Select a new needle. 
• 
Pull off the paper tab from the outer needle 
shield. 
Step 4: 
• 
Push the capped needle straight onto the Pen 
and twist the needle on until it is tight.

throw it away. 
• 
Pull off the inner needle shield and throw it 
away.

Throw 
Away 
Priming your Pen 
Prime before each injection. 
• 
Priming your Pen means removing the air from the needle and cartridge that may collect during 
normal use and ensures that your Pen is working correctly. 
• 
If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. 
Step 6: 
• 
To prime your Pen, turn the dose knob to 
select 2 units. 
173 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 7: 
• 
Hold your Pen with the needle pointing up. 
Tap the cartridge holder gently to collect air 
bubbles at the top. 
Step 8: 
• 
Continue holding your Pen with the needle 
pointing up. Push the dose knob in until it 
stops and “0” is seen in the dose window. Hold 
the dose knob in and count to 5 slowly. 
You should see insulin at the tip of the Needle. 
–  If you do not see insulin, repeat priming 
steps 6 to 8, but not more than 8 times. 
–  If you still do not see insulin, change the 
needle and repeat priming steps 6 to 8. 
Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your 
dose. 
Selecting your dose 
This Pen has been designed to deliver the dose that is shown in the dose window. Dial your usual 
dose as instructed by your healthcare professional. 
• 
• 
– 
– 
You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. 
If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than 1 injection. 
If you need help dividing up your dose the right way, ask your healthcare professional. 
Use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps. 
174 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 9: 
• 
Turn the dose knob to select the number of 
units you need to inject. The dose indicator 
should line up with your dose. 
–  The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. 
–  The dose knob clicks as you turn it. 
–  Do not dial your dose by counting the 
clicks. You may dial the wrong dose. This 
may lead to getting too much insulin or 
not enough insulin. 
–  The dose can be corrected by turning the 
dose knob in either direction until the 
correct dose lines up with the dose 
indicator. 
–  The even numbers are printed on the dial. 
The example to the right shows 12 units. 
–  The odd numbers, after the number 1, are 
shown as full lines between the numbers. 
The example to the right shows 25 units. 
Example: 12 units 
shown in the dose 
window 
• 
Always check the number in the dose 
window to make sure you have dialed the 
correct dose. 
Example: 25 units 
shown in the dose 
window 
• 
• 
• 
The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. 
If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: 
–  inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, 
or 
–  get a new Pen and inject the full dose. 
It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. Do not 
transfer this to a syringe. Severe overdose can result. 
Giving your injection 
• 
Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. 
• 
• 
Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. 
Do not try to change your dose while injecting. 
175 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 10: 
• 
Choose your injection site. 
Lyumjev is injected under the skin 
(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, 
buttocks, upper legs or upper arms. 
• 
Wipe your skin with a swab, and let 
your skin dry before you inject your 
dose. 
Step 11: 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin. 
• 
• 
Push the dose knob all the way in. 
Continue to hold the dose 
knob in and slowly count 
to 5 before removing the 
needle. 
5 sec 
Do not try to inject your insulin by turning the 
dose knob. You will not receive your insulin 
by turning the dose knob. 
176 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 12: 
• 
Pull the needle out of your skin. 
–  A drop of insulin at the needle tip is 
normal. It will not affect your dose. 
• 
Check the number in the dose window. 
–  If you see “0” in the dose window, you 
have received the full amount you dialed. 
–  If you do not see “0” in the dose window, 
you did not receive your full dose. Do not 
redial. Insert the needle into your skin and 
finish your injection. 
–  If you still do not think you received the 
full amount you dialed for your injection, 
do not start over or repeat that injection. 
Monitor your blood glucose as instructed 
by your healthcare professional. 
–  If you normally need to give 2 injections 
for your full dose, be sure to give your 
second injection. 
The plunger only moves a little with each injection, 
and you may not notice that it moves. 
If you see blood after you take the needle out of your 
skin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of 
gauze or a swab. Do not rub the area. 
After your injection 
Step 13: 
• 
Carefully replace the outer needle shield. 
Step 14: 
• 
Unscrew the capped needle and dispose of it 
as described below (see Disposing of Pens 
and needles section). 
• 
Do not store the Pen with the needle attached 
to prevent leaking, blocking the needle, and 
air from entering the Pen. 
177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 15: 
• 
Replace the Pen cap by lining up the cap clip 
with the dose indicator and pushing straight 
on. 
Disposing of Pens and needles 
•  
Put used needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw 
needles directly into your household waste. 
•  
•  
•  
Do not recycle the filled sharps container. 
Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container 
properly. 
The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare 
professional or institutional policies. 
Troubleshooting 
• 
If you cannot remove the Pen cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap 
straight off. 
• 
If the dose knob is hard to push: 
–  pushing the dose knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. 
–  your needle may be blocked. Put on a new needle and prime the Pen. 
–  you may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. 
If you have any questions or problems with your Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen, call your 
healthcare professional for help or contact your local Lilly affiliate.

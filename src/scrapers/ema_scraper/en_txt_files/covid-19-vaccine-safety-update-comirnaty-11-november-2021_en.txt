COVID-19 vaccine 
safety update  
COMIRNATY 
BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH 
The safety of Comirnaty is continuously monitored and safety updates are 
regularly provided to the public. This document outlines the outcomes 
from the assessment of emerging worldwide safety data carried out by 
EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) (see section 
1). It also contains high-level information from the reporting of suspected 
adverse reactions, which PRAC takes into account in its assessments (see 
section 2). 
This safety update follows the update of 6 October 2021. 
Main outcomes from PRAC's latest 
safety assessment 
There are no updates to the product 
information.  
Further assessment of myocarditis and 
pericarditis is ongoing. 
There is currently insufficient evidence of a 
possible link between Comirnaty and very rare 
cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome 
(MIS).

1.  Updates on safety assessments for 
Comirnaty 
During its meeting held 25 to 28 October 2021, PRAC assessed new safety 
data for Comirnaty (see section 2 ‘How safety is monitored’). 
Myocarditis and pericarditis  
PRAC is assessing further data on the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis 
following vaccination with Comirnaty.  
Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions of the heart. 
Symptoms can vary but often include breathlessness, a forceful heartbeat 
that may be irregular (palpitations), and chest pain. 
PRAC had previously reviewed cases of myocarditis and pericarditis 
spontaneously reported in the European Economic Area (EEA). The review 
concluded in July 2021 with a recommendation to list both conditions as 
side effects in the product information for Comirnaty, together with a 
warning to raise awareness among healthcare professionals and people 
receiving this vaccine. 
PRAC has now asked the company that markets Comirnaty to perform an 
in-depth review of all published data on the association of myocarditis and 
pericarditis with the vaccine, including clinical trial data, data from the 
literature and other data available in the public domain.

exposure data from EU Member States as well as from the additional countries of the 
European Economic Area (EEA) Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

COVID-19 vaccine safety update 
COMIRNATY 
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS)  
PRAC has concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence of a 
possible link between Comirnaty and very rare cases of multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome (MIS). 
MIS is a rare serious inflammatory condition affecting many parts of the 
body, and symptoms can include tiredness, persistent severe fever, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain, headache, chest pain and difficulty 
breathing. MIS has previously been reported following COVID-19 disease. 
The committee’s assessment is based on available spontaneously reported 
adverse events and currently does not warrant an update of the product 
information. Only a small number cases met the diagnostic criteria for 
MIS. Since other infections that could trigger MIS (including COVID-19) 
could not be fully excluded in all cases, PRAC concluded there is currently 
insufficient evidence of a possible link with Comirnaty. 
2.  How safety is monitored 
As for all COVID-19 vaccines, relevant new information emerging on 
Comirnaty is collected and promptly reviewed. This is in line with the 
pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines of the EU regulatory 
network (comprising the regulatory bodies of the EU Member States, EMA 
and the European Commission). 
Summary safety reports 
The pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines includes Monthly 
Summary Safety Reports (MSSRs) which are compiled by the marketing 
authorisation holders to support timely and continuous benefit-risk 
evaluations for COVID-19 vaccines used during the pandemic. MSSRs are 
intended to be compiled for at least the first six months of marketing 
(afterwards, pandemic summary safety reports may cover time periods 
longer than a month). These reports complement the submission of 
Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). 
Case reports of suspected side effects 
Collecting reports of medical events and problems that occur following the 
use of a medicine, and therefore might be side effects, is one of the pillars 
of the EU safety monitoring system. Healthcare professionals and 
vaccinated individuals are encouraged to report to their national 
competent authorities all suspected side effects individuals may have 
experienced after receiving a vaccine even if it is unclear whether the 
vaccine was the cause. For more information on how to report, including

Reporting suspected side effects. 
These spontaneous reports are collected in EudraVigilance, the EU 
database used for monitoring and analysing suspected side effects. 
Publicly available information can be accessed via EudraVigilance – 
European database of suspected drug reaction reports in all EU/EEA 
languages. Search for “COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine PFIZER-BIONTECH 
(Tozinameran)” to see all suspected side effect cases reported for 
Comirnaty. 
As of 28 October 2021, a total of 412,571 cases of suspected side effects 
with Comirnaty were spontaneously reported to EudraVigilance from 
EU/EEA countries; 5,520 of these reported a fatal outcome2,3. By the same 
date almost 428 million doses of Comirnaty had been given to people in 
the EU/EEA4.  
These reports describe suspected side effects in individuals, i.e. 
medical events observed following the use of a vaccine. The fact 
that someone has had a medical issue or died after vaccination 
does not necessarily mean that this was caused by the vaccine. 
This may have been caused, for example, by health problems not 
related to the vaccination.  
The EU regulatory network continuously monitors EudraVigilance to detect 
any new safety issues. EudraVigilance relies on individual healthcare 
professionals and patients to report their own experience. The monitoring 
detects unusual or unexpected patterns in the reports received for further 
investigation and risk assessment. EMA’s detailed assessments take into 
account all available data from all sources to draw a robust conclusion on 
the safety of the vaccine. These data include clinical trial results, reports 
of suspected side effects in EudraVigilance, epidemiological studies 
monitoring the safety of the vaccine, toxicological investigations and any 
other relevant information. 
Planned and ongoing studies 
The company that markets Comirnaty will continue to provide results from 
the main clinical trial, which is ongoing for up to two years. It will also 
conduct additional studies to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the 
vaccine as it is used in vaccination campaigns and other clinical practice. 
2 These figures have been calculated excluding cases reported from Northern Ireland (EU 
reporting requirements for suspected adverse reactions to EudraVigilance apply to 
Northern Ireland in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland). 
3 Source: EudraVigilance. These figures cannot be extracted directly from the public 
database of suspected adverse reactions, which groups information per type of side 
effects. As more than one suspected side effect may have been included in a single case 
report, the total number of side effects will never match the number of individual cases. 
Similarly, this public database does not provide the total number of cases reported with a 
fatal outcome.

COMIRNATY 
For the list of planned and ongoing safety studies for Comirnaty, see the 
risk management plan.  
A paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Comirnaty is in place. This 
describes how the company collects data on the vaccine’s efficacy and 
safety for its use in children.  
In addition, EMA is coordinating observational studies in EU Member 
States looking at real-world data from clinical practice to monitor the 
safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including in pregnant 
women. 
3.  Other information for Comirnaty 
Comirnaty is a vaccine that was authorised in the EU on 21 December 
2020 to prevent COVID-19 when infected with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-
2. COVID-19 is a potentially severe disease that may result in death. The 
initial marketing authorisation was for use in people aged 16 years and 
older; on 31 May 2021, the marketing authorisation was extended to use 
in individuals aged 12 years and older.  
Comirnaty contains a molecule called mRNA, which the body uses to 
temporarily produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is broken 
down shortly after vaccination. The spike protein does not cause COVID-
19.  
Before Comirnaty was granted an EU marketing authorisation, the efficacy 
and safety of the vaccine were assessed through pre-clinical studies and 
large clinical trials. More than 18,000 participants had been given the 
vaccine in clinical trials.  
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not 
everybody will experience them. The most common side effects known for 
Comirnaty are usually mild or moderate and get better within a few days 
after vaccination. 
More information on how Comirnaty works and its use is available in all 
EU/EEA languages in the medicine overview. This includes information on 
use in pregnant and breastfeeding women and immunocompromised 
individuals. 
The full product information with the summary of product characteristics 
and the package leaflet is also available in all EU/EEA languages.

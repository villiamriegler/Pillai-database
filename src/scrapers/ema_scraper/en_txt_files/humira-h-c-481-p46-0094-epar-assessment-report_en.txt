Introduction 
On 26 June 2016, the MAH submitted a completed Japanese study for Humira. The study included 2 
paediatric patients, and was therefore submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
This AR is aimed to inform about this submission. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Clinical aspects 
1.1.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report with study results from the Japanese non-PASS-PMOS Study 
P12-772: 
“The documentation of the effects on Quality of Life (QOL) and Working Productivity and 
Activity Impairment (WPAI) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) under HUMIRA 
(Adalimumab) in routine clinical practice.” 
1.1.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
The MAH conducted a single-arm, multi-center, prospective cohort study (Post-Marketing 
Observational Study) in Japan. The study was conducted from May 2011 to January 2015. 
The observation period for each subject was 48 weeks. 
The primary objectives were to assess work productivity using the Work Productivity and Activity 
Impairment-Rheumatoid Arthritis questionnaire (WPAI-RA) and functional impairment (daily life 
activity) using the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) in RA patients 
treated with adalimumab. 
The secondary objectives were to assess the health related quality of life, clinical benefits, safety, and 
factors affecting safety and effectiveness in RA patients treated with adalimumab as measured by the 
EuroQol Questionnaire 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Simplified 
Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28). 
Safety was assessed by adverse events and adverse drug reactions reporting. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 2,088 registration forms were obtained, and 1,998 patients were registered after duplicate 
registrations were removed. Among the 1,973 patients with retrieved CRFs, a total of 1,968 patients 
were included in the safety analysis set, and 1,808 patients in the efficacy analysis set.

Baseline data 
Patients consisted of 1,484 women (75.4%) and 484 men (24.6%). The average age was 55.8 ± 13.5 
years, and ranged from 15 to 87 years. Patients had an average disease duration of 6.79 ± 8.05 years. 
636 patients (32.3%) were classified as having early RA, defined as within 2 years of diagnosis. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy results are not assessed here.  
Safety results 
Among 1,968 patients included in the safety analysis set, 451 patients experienced 597 adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs). The reporting rate of ADRs was 22.92%. A total of 87 serious ADRs were reported in 
79 patients. The reporting rate was 4.01%.  
The safety profile did not differ substantially between this survey and the drug-use results survey, in 
which the reporting rate of ADRs was 23.4% (1,847/7,739 patients) and that of serious ADRs was 
4.5% (349/7,739 patients). 
Assessor's comment: The drug-use result survey was an observational study conducted in Japanese 
RA patients. 
There were two paediatric patients under the age of 18 years which experienced no AEs. 
Discussion 
The study only included 2 children whereof the youngest was 15 years old. None of these reported an 
AE. From a paediatric perspective, no data allowing for any conclusions was presented. 
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The MAH´s conclusion that given the very few paediatric patients enrolled into this study, no reliable or 
robust conclusions on the impact of this Japanese data on a European paediatric population can be 
drawn, is endorsed. 
The benefit risk balance of Humira is unchanged. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
  Not fulfilled: 
Additional clarifications requested 
Not applicable.

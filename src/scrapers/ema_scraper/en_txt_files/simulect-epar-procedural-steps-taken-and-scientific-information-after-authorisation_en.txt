1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC and PL 
The cautionary statement regarding hypersensitivity 
the information presenting symptoms of 
hypersensitivity reactions and to revise the 
frequency category for "Immune system disorders" 
identified based on post-marketing reports. The 
package leaflet is updated accordingly. Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC is also updated to harmonise the warning 
statements on "neoplasms and infections" with those 
in section 4.8. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
reactions has been revised in order to harmonise the 
characterisation of symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions 
in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
A reliable enumeration of the frequency of hypersensitivity 
reactions based on reports from the post-marketing setting 
was almost impossible, due to the suspected high rate of 
under-reporting. The MAH therefore proposes to delete the 
sentence related to the frequency of the events in section 
4.4 and to propose the following statement in section 4.8: 
"Because these reactions are reported voluntary from a 
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to 
reliably estimate their frequency. 
Based on data from clinical trials, the overall incidence and 
profile of viral, bacterial and fungal infections amongst 
patients using dual or triple immunosuppressive therapy 
was similar in Simulect (75.9%) and placebo treated 
groups. The same was true for the rate of opportunistic 
infections, such as CMV infections (14.6% vs. 17.3%). A 
statement regarding the incidence of opportunistic 
infections as reported from clinical trials was therefore 
added to section 4.4, to bring the wording in line with 
statements in section 4.8.

Change in test procedure for starting materials used

substance. 
B.I.b.2.d - Change in test procedure for AS or 
and vaccination is available. However, vaccination 
guidelines for immunocompromised patients display that 
the application of live-virus vaccines was not recommended 
due to the risk of uninhibited viral replication. Moreover, 
there is only little evidence from literature that the 
administration of live-virus vaccines in solid organ 
transplant recipients was safe. Prospective studies would be 
impossible due to ethical considerations.  
In contrast, the administration of approved inactivated 
vaccines according to the schedules for the general 
population are consistently considered safe in patients after 
organ transplantation and have not been found as being 
associated with vaccination related adverse events or with 
the induction of transplant rejections. Though, response to 
vaccination might be reduced in immunocompromised 
patients. 
Therefore, the inclusion of information reflecting current 
data available on the use of live and inactivated vaccines in 
immunocompromised patients in the Simulect EU SmPC is 
endorsed by the CHMP.

To change to the manufacturing process, to tighten 
specification limits, to tighten in process controls 
limits and minor change to an approved test 
study DE01 in the Simulect's SmPC. Apart from deficiencies 
in the clinical trial conduct and analysis one major problem 
is the lack of understanding of the relevance of "borderline" 
changes in the biopsies. Exclusion of borderline cases from 
the definition of acute rejection leads to clearer benefit of 
basiliximab therapy, inclusion of borderline cases decreases 
the differences between both treatment arms. Of note, 
inclusion of borderline cases and analysing the Kaplan-
Meier curves for the primary composite endpoint (survival, 
graft survival, acute rejection) show merely a delay of 
events and an aligning of the curves at a later time point. 
The safety is difficult to evaluate as multiple confounding 
factors are present in this patient population. The CHMP 
agrees that the data in summary indicate that basiliximab 
may reduce the rate of acute biopsy proven rejection but a 
proof is lacking. It also remains unclear whether the 
assumed reduction of biopsy proven rejection translates 
into a longer lasting benefit for the patient. This is similar 
to the situation in adults but the prevention of acute 
rejections has been accepted as a treatment goal in itself 
since it is associated with a better long term outcome. 
Taken together the benefit risk balance appears to be 
similar in children and adults.

pregnancy and lactation. Furthermore, the annexes

responses by the MAH, the CHMP considered that the 
current wording of the SPC could lead to an 
underestimation of the risk for developing opportunistic 
infections and lymphoproliferative disorders and a revision 
of the SPC was recommended. As a result, within this 
variation, the statements considered as misleading were 
removed from sections 4.4 and 4.8. Furthermore,

measures requested by the CPMP at the time of the opinion 
of the initial Marketing Authorisation. The aim of these 
studies was to collect information about the graft and 
patients survival up to five years after transplantation. 
Long-term chronic graft failure is still a matter of concern 
after renal transplantation. Acute rejection episodes are an 
important risk factor for chronic rejection and graft loss. In 
section 5.1  (Pharmacodynamic properties) of the SPC, the 
following changes were endorsed by the CPMP: "Clinical 
studies:(_)In a pooled analysis of two five-year open-label 
extension studies (586 patients total) the combined graft 
and patient survival rates were not statistically different for 
the Simulect and placebo groups. Extension studies also 
showed that patients who experienced an acute rejection 
episode during the first year after transplantation 
experienced more graft losses and deaths over the five-
year follow-up period than patients who had no rejection. 
These events were not influenced by Simulect .

not submitted and this was considered acceptable. Overall 
the risk/benefit profile was considered unchanged and a

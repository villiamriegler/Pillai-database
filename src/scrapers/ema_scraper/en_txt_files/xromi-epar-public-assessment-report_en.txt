Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice on 01 April 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3241/1/2016/SME/III) and 23 
March 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3241/1/FU/1/2017/SME/III) for the development programme supporting the 
indication granted by the CHMP. The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical, and 
clinical aspects: 
•  Suitability of the proposed oral liquid formulation for children. Acceptability of the proposed limit 
of an identified impurity of NMT 0.5% in the drug product specification during shelf-life. 
•  Requirement for non-clinical pharmacology or toxicology studies with respect to the excipients 
proposed for the intended marketed formulation and the drug substance. 
•  Sufficiency of published efficacy and safety data to support an indication in infants aged 9 months 
– 2 years, at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day without escalation, regardless of the severity of the disease. 
Need for additional efficacy and safety data in adults, adolescents and children aged >2 years. 
Sufficiency of a relative bioavailability study in healthy adult volunteers comparing Nova’s 
hydroxycarbamide 100mg/mL oral solution to the innovator Hydrea 500mg capsule to establish 
the bridge between the new formulation and Hydrea-based literature. Appropriateness of the 
proposed clinical study protocol for generating PK data in infants and children, and for providing 
the reassurance for weight based dosing across the paediatric age range.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application was submitted under a 10(3) hybrid legal basis, using Hydrea (containing 
hydroxycarbamide) as a reference product. Hydrea is authorised for treatment of chronic myeloid 
leukaemia and cancer of the cervix in conjunction with radiotherapy, but not for the indication applied for 
by Nova Laboratories for Xromi. Another hydroxycarbamide containing medicinal product, Siklos, was 
granted a MA in EU in 2007 and is indicated for the following indication: “Prevention of recurrent painful 
vaso-occlusive crises including acute chest syndrome in adults, adolescents and children older than 2 
years suffering from symptomatic Sickle Cell Syndrome.” 
The applicant has conducted a systematic review of the published literature relating to the efficacy and 
safety of hydroxycarbamide in the treatment of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Based on an evaluation of the 
totality of data reported in the literature, the applicant justified that the proposed oral solution 
formulation is expected to perform in the same way as the oral liquid formulation and capsules used in the 
reported studies. No non-clinical pharmacological or toxicological studies have been performed 
considering the long clinical history of hydroxycarbamide. 
Xromi 100 mg/ml is an oral solution, one ml of which contains 100 mg hydroxycarbamide. It belongs to 
the pharmacotherapeutic group of other antineoplastic agents and its ATC code is L01XX05. 
Hydroxycarbamide (international non-proprietary name, INN), also known as Hydroxyurea, has the 
chemical formula CH4N2O2 and a molecular weight of 76.05 and is classified as a cytotoxic, 
antimetabolite, antineoplastic agent. The main mechanism of action of hydroxycarbamide is the 
reversible inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, which causes temporary arrest of haematopoiesis and 
induces the so called “stress erythropoiesis”. The marrow responds to this stressed state by enhanced 
erythropoiesis and increased HbF production. HbF inhibits intracellular HbS polymerization and prevents 
the sickling process within erythrocytes. Another action of hydroxycarbamide is improving blood flow 
through reduced intercellular adhesion. Decreased expression of RBCs, white blood cells, and endothelial 
integrins and other adhesion molecules probably improves microvascular blood flow and reduces 
pro-inflammatory cell–cell interactions. Hydroxycarbamide may also stimulate nitric oxide (NO) 
production as an NO donor or through stimulation of intermediates. The primary pharmacodynamic effect 
of hydroxycarbamide is the increase of HbF, preventing thus the formation of HbS and ameliorating the 
clinical effect of SCD. Optimal results are achieved when the dose is escalated to MTD.  
Xromi 100 mg/mL oral solution’s posology is based on the patient’s body weight. The usual starting dose 
of hydroxycarbamide is 15 mg/kg/day, the usual maintenance dose is between 20-25 mg/kg, and the 
maximum dose is 35 mg/kg/day. Full blood cell count with white cell differential and reticulocyte count 
should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first 2 months following treatment initiation. If neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia occurs, hydroxycarbamide dosing should be temporarily withheld and full blood cell 
count with white cell differential should be monitored weekly. When blood counts have recovered, 
hydroxycarbamide should be reinstated at a dose 5 mg/kg/day lower than the dose given before onset of 
cytopenias. If dose escalation is warranted based on clinical and laboratory findings, dosing should be 
increased by 5 mg/kg/day increments every 8 weeks until mild myelosuppression is achieved, up to a 
maximum of 35 mg/kg/day. Once a stable dose is established, laboratory safety monitoring should 
include full blood cell count with white cell differential, reticulocyte count, and platelet count every 2–3 
months. A clinical response to treatment with hydroxycarbamide may take 3-6 months and therefore, a 
6-month trial on the MTD is required prior to considering discontinuation due to treatment failure 
(whether due to lack of adherence or failure to respond to therapy).

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as oral solution containing 100 mg/ml of hydroxycarbamide as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are: xanthan gum (E415), sucralose (E955), strawberry flavour, methyl 
parahydroxybenzoate (E218), sodium hydroxide (E524), and purified water.  
The product is available in Amber type III glass bottle with tamper evident child-resistant closure (HDPE 
with expanded polyethylene liner) as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
Each pack contains an HDPE bottle adaptor and 2 polyethylene dosing syringes (a red syringe graduated 
to 3 ml and a white syringe graduated to 12 ml). 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of hydroxycarbamide is N-hydroxyurea corresponding to the molecular formula 
CH4N2O2 It has a relative molecular mass of 76.05 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The relevant information of the chemical structure of active substance has been assessed by the EDQM 
before issuing the Certificate of Suitability (CEP). 
The active substance is a hygroscopic white or almost white, crystalline powder, soluble in water, and 
practically insoluble in alcohol.  
Hydroxycarbamide has a non - chiral molecular structure.  
The European Pharmacopoeia monograph for hydroxycarbamide (monograph 1616) states that the 
substance shows polymorphism. There was no evidence of this property having any significant effect on 
hydroxycarbamide dissolution rate and solubility during development studies and in pilot-scale 
manufacture of the finished product. 
As there is a monograph of the active substance in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the 
active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability.

The active substance is packed into sealed a double “food-grade” polyethylene inner bag which complies 
with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended put in fibre drums with metal cover. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for identification (FT-IR, TLC), assay (HPLC), urea (TLC), 
impurities (HPLC), chlorides (Ph. Eur.), water (KF), and sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.).  
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph. In addition, any impurity by HPLC to not more than 0.05% is controlled, in accordance with 
Ph. Eur. 2034.   
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Stability 
The CEP submitted does not include any information on the active substance retest period, additional 
information was submitted on stability. 
Stability data from 7 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% 
RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, loss on drying, assay and degradation products. 
All tested parameters under long term and accelerated conditions were within the specifications. 
Results on stress conditions were also provide on one batch. Forced degradation was performed by the 
exposure to the following stress conditions: acid- and base-mediated degradation (1N HCl, 0.1N HCl, 1N 
NaOH, and 0.1N NaOH for 72 hours), oxidative (peroxide, 0.5% and 2% H2O2 for 72 hours) degradation, 
temperature (~80 °C for 72 hours) degradation, moisture degradation (40 °C/ 75% RH for 72 hours), and 
photodegradation. 
The active substance shows minimal degradation, indicating a reasonable level of stability in these 
conditions when exposed to acidic or oxidative conditions, as well as heat. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. All tested parameters 
were within the specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months without storage 
conditions in the proposed container.

Hydroxycarbamide is a cytotoxic, antimetabolite, and antineoplastic agent used for several decades to 
treat a variety of medical disorders and was approved for the treatment of adults with sickle cell anaemia 
(SCA) (Hydrea) which is manufactured as capsules. The aim of the pharmaceutical development of the 
finished product was to improve the acceptability of the formulation in children under 6 years old who 
have difficulties swallowing tablets or capsules. Hydroxycarbamide oral solution administered using an 
oral syringe will allow the dose of hydroxycarbamide to be individualised to the patient’s maximum 
tolerated dose, both accurately and safely. Moreover, improved ease of administration for children will 
enhance medication acceptability and adherence. 
From previous experience, hydroxycarbamide was known to be compatible with most of the excipients 
used in this formulation. Hydroxycarbamide stability has since been confirmed by formal stability testing. 
Hydroxycarbamide is described as “freely soluble in water” in the European Pharmacopoeia. As such it is 
an ideal candidate for a solution formulation. The hydroxycarbamide solution is formulated at a pH which 
provides maximum stability. The powder is odourless or almost odourless. The active substance is 
cytotoxic, and as such formulation design has taken into account minimisation of exposure during use. 
This is particularly important for a finished product designed for use in the paediatric population, where a 
guardian is likely to be frequently involved in dosing. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards, with the exception of strawberry liquid flavour which complies with ‘In-house’ specifications. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The provided literature data indicated that chemical stability would be a challenge since 
hydroxycarbamide is highly soluble and unstable in aqueous environment. Initial formulation stability 
studies confirmed this. The degradation pathways are not clearly defined in literature, although pH 
induced hydrolysis was considered the most plausible and likely degradation pathway. Thus, pH was likely 
to be a critical parameter of the formulation. Degradation was significantly reduced by storing samples at 
5°C and hence subsequent stability testing was conducted at 5°C for long-term and 25°C/60%RH 
accelerated conditions.   
The level of sucralose was selected based on levels typically used in oral pharmaceuticals and the level of 
strawberry liquid flavor was determined based on the range recommended by the manufacturer. 
Palatability has been assessed by a questionnaire as part of the bioequivalence study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 16/133 
 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process involves successive dissolution of the formulation components by stirring to 
form a clear solution.   
A study to assess the bioequivalence of an oral hydroxycarbamide solution 500 mg/5 mL versus two 
formulations of oral hydroxycarbamide capsule 500 mg (Hydrea) was performed showing bioequivalence 
between the formulations.   
The primary packaging is Amber type III glass bottle with tamper evident child-resistant closure (HDPE 
with expanded polyethylene liner). The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice 
of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use 
of the product. Each pack contains an HDPE bottle adaptor and 2 polyethylene dosing syringes (a red 
syringe graduated to 3 ml and a white syringe graduated to 12 ml). The medical devices are CE marked. 
Although the active is present in solution in the formulation, given that the contact period between the 
oral solution and the syringe is brief, no significant interaction is anticipated.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: weighing of ingredients, preparation of solution, 
filling and closure. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release  and shelf –life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), pH (Ph. Eur.), viscosity (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of mass of delivered doses (Ph. 
Eur.),  hydroxycarbamide  content  (HPLC),  identification  hydroxycarbamide  (HPLC,  UV),  related 
substances  (HPLC),  methyl  hydroxybenzoate  content  (HPLC),  identification  methyl  hydroxybenzoate 
(HPLC, diode array detection), fill volume, TAMC (Ph. Eur), TYMC (Ph. Eur)and specified microorganism, 
Escherichia coli (Ph.Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months and 1 pilot batch 
stored for up to 21 months under long term conditions (2-8 ºC) and for up to 3 months under accelerated 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 17/133 
 
 
 
Samples were tested for appearance, pH, assay of hydroxycarbamide, related substances, assay of 
methyl hydroxybenzoate, viscosity, total viable count, microbial limit test (absence of E. coli), and 
preservative efficacy. 
Initial formulation studies indicated that data from long term (2-8°C) showed that the product meets the 
proposed shelf life specification.  For the pilot scale batch stability studies, a significant change occurred 
at the accelerated condition (25°C/60%RH) with regards to the level of an unknown related substance 
which exceeds the acceptance limit in the first 3 months’ testing. Therefore, stability testing at the 
accelerated condition was not conducted after 3 months.  
Two additional studies were performed: a hold time study evaluated the stability of the formulation during 
manufacture at room temperature and a thermal cycling study to evaluate temperature excursions which 
may occur during commercial product distribution. The conclusion from both of these studies is that short 
term excursions above 5°C will not have a detrimental effect on the stability of the finished product. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The data indicate that hydroxycarbamide is not susceptible to 
photodegradation. Results indicate that storage in amber glass bottles is sufficient protection for the 
finished product against photo-degradation. 
An in-use stability study was conducted on one batch at 9 months after manufacture and on another batch 
at 3 months. Five bottles were used from each batch and the study was conducted over 12 weeks. Bottles 
were stored at 2-8°C for the duration of the study. On each day of sampling the bottle was removed from 
storage, the sample removed, and then the bottle returned to 2-8°C storage. This allowed the withdrawal 
of product on up to 60 occasions from a single bottle of product. As the study was conducted over an 
extended period of time the product was subjected to a maximum challenge. There was no detectable 
bioburden at the end of the study for both batches. A further study has been conducted on one batch at 
20 months after manufacture. The study design is similar to that mentioned, however, chemical testing 
was only performed every four weeks and includes viscosity and microbiological testing is performed at 8 
weeks and 12 weeks and includes preservative efficacy. To support this study design eighteen bottles 
were used. There was no loss of potency of hydroxycarbamide during the studies. All analytical and 
microbiological parameters remained within specification over the duration of the studies. Microbiological 
contamination remained at very low levels. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and store in a refrigerator (2°C - 
8°C) and the in-use shelf-life “After first opening to be used within 12 weeks”, as stated in the SmPC 
(section 6.3), are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No formal non-clinical development programme was undertaken for hydroxycarbamide, the non-clinical 
data is based on relevant information identified from the literature. The use of hydroxycarbamide over 
many decades has provided much information on this compound that has led to its use, first in oncology 
and then in haematological indications, such as sickle cell disease. Due to its historic use in the clinic, this 
has also resulted in limited pre-clinical studies being published in the literature. However, there have 
been several comprehensive reviews including IARC and NTP, which have contributed significantly to the 
general information available in evaluating hydroxycarbamide. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The principle and most well understood mechanism of action of hydroxycarbamide, which was first 
demonstrated in vitro, is the reversible inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, a critical enzyme that 
converts ribonucleosides into deoxyribonucleosides, which are required for the synthesis and repair of 
DNA. Other benefits include increased levels of nitric oxide and cyclic nucleotides that may facilitate 
vascular dilatation and also induce HbF, and even direct salutary effects on the vascular endothelium, 
reduced expression of surface molecules that adhere to the endothelium, decreased neutrophil adhesion 
and effects on sickle red blood cell rheology. The applicant was requested and submitted data from more 
recent studies on the mechanism of action of hydroxycarbamide, such as those presented at Silva-Pinto 
2014 and Cokic 2007. Data argued that although various mechanisms of action of hydroxycarbamide 
have been identified in the literature, it is generally agreed that its precise role and/or contribution of each 
mechanism is currently unclear. 
Bibliographical references concerning in vivo pharmacology study results, strongly suggested that 
hydroxycarbamide (an S-phase–specific cytotoxic) increases HbF by a mechanism that does not involve 
inhibition of DNA methylation. Furthermore, the combination of SCF+EPO+hydroxycarbamide resulted in 
an additional two-fold increase in HbF, whereas F-cells and F-reticulocytes increased only 25% compared 
to the SCF + EPO regimen. Further studies have examined the possible modes of action by which 
hydroxycarbamide may be acting resulted that induction of foetal haemoglobin was required for beneficial 
clinical effects. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
The cardiovascular safety of hydroxycarbamide was examined in a safety pharmacology study in dogs 
resulting that all cardiovascular effects reported with hydroxycarbamide were reversible within 24 hours. 
Other toxicity studies (not only cardiovascular) were presented and analysed chronic hydroxycarbamide 
administration in animals. The available data in animals have identified a range of toxicities in rats, dogs, 
monkeys. However, the results from non-clinical studies have not been reflected in data from clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 19/133 
 
 
 
studies. A chronic administration for up to 15 years of hydroxycarbamide in clinical studies has 
demonstrated an absence of the toxicities previously observed in non-clinical data. 
Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions 
There are limited studies in the non-clinical literature regarding pharmacodynamic drug interactions with 
hydroxycarbamide. However it is known that hydroxycarbamide interacts with antiretroviral drugs when 
used concomitantly leading to increased toxicity. Although hydroxycarbamide is not indicated for the 
treatment of HIV infection, patients with HIV infection that are administered with hydroxycarbamide and 
didanosine, with or without stavudine, have experience fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis. Additionally, 
hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death have been reported during postmarketing 
surveillance in patients with HIV infection treated with hydroxycarbamide and other antiretroviral drugs. 
Peripheral neuropathy, has been reported in patients with HIV infection receiving hydroxycarbamide in 
combination with antiretroviral drugs. 
There is also evidence that there is an analytical interference of hydroxycarbamide with the enzymes 
(urease, uricase, and lactate dehydrogenase) used in the determination of urea, uric acid, and lactic acid, 
rendering falsely elevated results of these in patients treated with hydroxycarbamide. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion data are based upon studies in the literature and no 
formal development programme was undertaken for hydroxycarbamide by the applicant.  
Methods of analysis are not always described in the publications on hydroxycarbamide pharmacokinetics. 
In cases where analytical methods are mentioned these include high performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC), liquid scintillation counting, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 
Absorption and elimination was found to follow first-order kinetics after intraperitoneal administration of 
hydroxycarbamide in a study comparing wild type to transgenic sickle cell mice. Studies in vitro have 
identified that hydroxycarbamide is a substrate for organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B) 
transporters.  
Investigation using OATP1B homozygous knockout mice also suggested that OATP1B transporters have a 
role in the absorption and the distribution of hydroxycarbamide and revealed accumulation of 
hydroxycarbamide in the kidney and liver of wild type mice. Hydroxycarbamide ability to cross the blood 
- brain barrier and the dependence of this movement on organic anion transportation was shown in 
anaesthetised guinea-pigs with the use of non-clinical distribution data.  
In a recent metabolism study with wild type and transgenic sickle cell mice, HPLC analysis of the 
hydroxycarbamide extracted from the urine showed that there was no change in the parent compound. 
The non-clinical metabolism data derived from previous distribution and excretion studies, concluded that 
basically 100% of the excreted C14 would be accounted for as unchanged parent, urea and carbonate.  
In vitro investigation of the effect of CYP450 (human cytochromes) and P-glycoprotein on 
hydroxycarbamide metabolism concluded that hydroxycarbamide is unlikely to cause clinically relevant 
drug interactions with the substrates of these enzymes/transporters.  
Excretion, following intraperitoneal (mice and rats) and oral administration (mice) of 
C14-hydroxycarbamide, was found to be predominantly and rapidly via the urine.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity  
Table 2: single dose toxicity 
In single-dose studies, mice and rats were exposed to a single oral dose of hydroxycarbamide followed by 
a 14-day observation period. The acute median lethal dose was within 5,000 to 15,000 mg/kg b.w. 
depending on animal species and route of administration. 
Deaths were observed after several days. The major clinical sign observed was aplasia (no further 
specifics available). The oral LD50 of hydroxycarbamide was 7,330 mg/kg b.w. in mice and 5,780 mg/kg 
b.w. in rats (Hydrea Bristol-Myers Squibb Patient Information 2010). 
Additionally, in male rabbits receiving a single intravenous injection of 150 mg/kg b.w. hydroxycarbamide 
solution, there was an early but transient significant decrease in blood erythrocyte count (approximately 
30% lower at day 3 after hydroxycarbamide) with a gradual increase in their osmotic resistance, a 
suppression of granulocyte phagocytic capacity (approximately 50% at day 3), and a rapid increase in the 
proportion of lymphocytes without detectable lysosomes (2-fold at 24 hours). Furthermore, serum acid 
phosphatase activity was elevated at day 7 after hydroxycarbamide administration, which may have 
reflected a manifestation of cell injury. Histological analysis of the liver of BALB/c mice analogously 
treated with hydroxycarbamide, revealed a marked hepatotoxicity, manifested as dilation of the intercell 
cord spaces and bile capillaries, the appearance of numerous balloon cells, cells with pyknotic nuclei, 
undetectable nucleoli and necrosis; particularly in the centres of hepatic lobules. To explain the observed 
toxicities, it was hypothesized that hydroxycarbamide initiated free radical mediated reactions (Malec et 
al, 1989). 
Repeat dose toxicity  
Table 3: Repeat dose toxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 21/133 
 
 
 
 
 
In both the rat and dog models 50 mg/kg/day dose was considered well tolerated and as the no adverse 
effect level due. In the one month study in dogs results showed that a dose of 50 mg/kg/day administered 
once-daily for one month was tolerated with no adverse clinical signs or effects on body weight, food 
consumption, or ophthalmic assessments (Morton et al., 2015). However, long-term hydroxycarbamide 
treatment in dogs, (up to four months), with daily doses of up to 30 mg/kg, the following effects have 
been noted: myelosuppression, gastrointestinal complications and, rarely, onychomadesis. Within a 
month of cessation of treatment, all nails had healed completely (Marconato et al., 2007). 
Genotoxicity 
An IARC monograph was published in 2000, which concluded that hydroxycarbamide neither bonds 
chemically or otherwise to DNA. However, it is known to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, which converts 
ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleotide diphosphate precursers for de-novo DNA synthesis 
(IARC 2000). A study in 2011 concluded that hydroxycarbamide showed mutagenic and genotoxic 
potential (Santos et al 2011). 
Carcinogenicity 
Table 4: Carcinogenicity studies: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 22/133 
 
 
 
 
The IARC concluded that there was inadequate evidence in both humans and experimental animals for the 
carcinogenicity of hydroxycarbamide, and as such gave an overall evaluation that hydroxycarbamide was 
not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3, IARC, 2000). 
Given the nature of the product, even with limited data, the possibility of carcinogenicity remains as 
hydroxycarbamide is presumed to be a trans-species carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term 
hydroxycarbamide for myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukaemia has been reported. It is 
unknown whether leukaemogenic effects are secondary to the drug or associated with the underlying 
SCD. Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxycarbamide treatment. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Hydroxycarbamide has been shown to cause testicular atrophy, reducing sperm production in male rats, 
and hydroxycarbamide at 500 mg/kg b.w. causes up to 50% loss of testicular weight in male mice by day 
29.  
Hydroxycarbamide crosses the placental barrier and damages embryos in rats. Repeated oral 
administration of hydroxycarbamide during the organogenesis period at dose levels ranging from 50 to 
450 mg/kg b.w. leads to a dosedependent embryo-lethal and teratogenic effect with an evident dose 
response relationship. Live foetuses at term generally show severe ocular and craniofacial anomalies; 
hydrocephalus, cardiovascular abnormalities, vertebral and costal defects. Rat embryos are 
teratogenically more sensitive to hydroxycarbamide than monkey embryos. Several other studies have 
been conducted in NMRI mice, rats, golden hamsters, New Zealand White rabbits, European and Persian 
breeds of cats and Rhesus monkeys at varying stages of gestation. The IARC concluded that 
hydroxycarbamide was a teratogen and caused postnatal behavioural deficits after prenatal exposure in 
all species tested (IARC, 2000). 
In 2008 the NTP Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction published the results of a 
review evaluating the potential for hydroxycarbamide to cause adverse effects on reproduction and 
development in humans. 
Evidence in the literature after publication of the NTP review has been in agreement with the NTP review 
regarding the reproductive effects of hydroxycarbamide.  
Jones et al., 2009 reported hydroxycarbamide administration to male transgenic sickle cell mice was 
shown to exacerbate the existing hypogonadism to gonadal failure. 
Treatment with hydroxycarbamide to C57Bl/6J mice compromised folliculogenesis and the ability of 
generated embryos to develop (Sampson et al., 2010). Others reported that hydroxycarbamide was also 
able to induce neural tube defects in a murine model via perturbation of deoxynucleoside triphosphate 
metabolism and associated abnormal cell balance between proliferation and apoptosis (Guan et al., 
2015). New Zealand White rabbits were shown to be sensitive to hydroxycarbamide on gestation days 8 
to 13 regarding axial skeletal development and on gestation days 11 to 16 and 11 to 12 regarding 
disruption of appendicular and cranio-facial skeletal development respectively (Campion et al 2012). 
Following extensive review of the literature, the NTP concluded that there is serious concern that 
exposure of therapeutic doses of hydroxycarbamide to men (who have reached puberty) may affect 
sperm production. 
The NTP concluded that there is concern that exposure of pregnant women to hydroxycarbamide could 
result in birth defects, abnormalities of foetal growth or abnormal postnatal development in offspring. 
However the NTP expressed minimal concern that exposure of therapeutic doses of hydroxycarbamide to 
children aged 5 to 15 years of age would adversely affect growth (NTP, 2008). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 23/133 
 
 
 
The NTP found that hydroxycarbamide can cross the placenta and is found in breast milk and as such use 
of hydroxycarbamide in pregnancy/lactation could lead to exposure to the unborn child and infant (NTP, 
2008). 
Local tolerance 
No local tolerance studies/data were submitted. 
Other toxicity studies 
The applicant submitted the results of a 10-day toxicity study in rats (conducted upon FDA request), as 
committed. The objective of the study was to provide adequate safety information in order to permit 
qualification of the identified impurity at a limit of 0.5%. A Scientific Advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/172730/2017) had already been addressed to the CHMP, concluding that the 
proposed limit of the identified impurity of NMT 0.5% in the drug product specification during shelf-life, is 
considered justified. The toxicity of the Sponsor’s formulation of hydroxyurea containing an identified 
impurity, was compared with the same formulation in the absence of the impurity, and also the listed drug 
form of hydroxyurea, Hydrea, following daily gavage administration for 10 days. In the absence of a clear 
difference in toxicity between the applicant’s formulations of hydroxyurea, with or without impurity, it 
was concluded that the impurity was considered not to have exacerbated the toxicity of hydroxyurea or to 
have a novel toxicity profile of its own. Therefore, the qualification limit of 0.5% of the identified impurity, 
suggested by the toxicology study, is in agreement to the already agreed qualification limit based on 
literature data and safety data from clinical use in children. 
A toxicology study in rats was submitted by the applicant during the assessment phase, intended to 
qualify the levels of this impurity at the drug product specification. The qualification limit of 0.5% 
concluded by the study is in agreement to the previously agreed qualification limit of this impurity based 
on literature data and safety data from clinical use in children.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has suggested that Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories 100 mg/ml oral solution’s 
PECSURFACEWATER value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log Kow 
does not exceed 4.5.   
The applicant was asked to provide further clarification on the calculation of DOSEai, used to estimate the 
Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) in surface water, taking into account the maximum daily 
dose of active ingredient described in the proposed SPC (35 mg/kg/day, also used for adults). The 
Applicant was also informed that since PEC value is greater than 0.01 μg/ml, Phase II assessment is 
expected to be conducted.  
A clarification, regarding the calculation of DOSEai and Fpen, was provided by the applicant, based on 
data obtained from the use of hydroxycarbamide in children.  
The calculation of the DOSEai (Maximum daily dose consumed per inhabitant) by the applicant, was not 
accepted. For DOSEai calculation the highest recommended dose should be used, which should be based 
on a bodyweight of an adult patient and not of a child patient (as proposed by the applicant), taking into 
account that Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories is proposed for indication to both children and adults. 
Furthermore, the proposed SmPC describes the maximum daily dose at 35mg/kg/day. Even if the product 
is primarily designed with children in mind, the analysis of the potential risk that the use of the medicine 
poses to the environment has to be calculated based on the target group described by the indication of the 
product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 24/133 
 
 
 
Fpen represents the fraction of a population receiving the drug substance during a given time. The Fpen 
value was calculated by the applicant based on the impact of the use of hydroxycarbamide in children 2-9 
years of age. Although, taking into account that Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories is proposed for 
indication to both children and adults, it is the Committee’s view that Fpen value should be derived 
directly by the prevalence of SCD in the EU, which is 1.5 in 10000.  
Given the above calculations, the PECSURFACEWATER value is estimated to be above the limit of 0.01 
μg/l.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
• 
The applicant should conduct an OECD 309 test on biodegradability and submit the results in 18 
months. In addition, the applicant should also conduct a full Phase II study including an OECD 308 
test with results to be provided in 3 years following approval of Xromi 100 mg/ml oral solution. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
As Hydroxycarbamide is a well-known active substance, no further studies on pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology are required. Since hydroxycarbamide is already in use in humans for a 
long time, the metabolism in humans is well understood. Therefore, this approach is considered

acceptable, according to the EMA Guideline on the Non-Clinical Documentation for Mixed Marketing 
Authorisation Applications (CHMP/SWP/799/95, 2005), particularly given the extensive clinical 
experience with hydroxycarbamide.  
Pharmacology 
The pharmacology studies sourced from published literature demonstrate proof of concept that the 
primary effect of hydroxycarbamide is to increase HbF levels. HbF inhibits intracellular HbS 
polymerisation and prevents the sickling process within erythrocytes.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion data are based upon studies in the literature and no 
formal development programme was undertaken for hydroxycarbamide by the Applicant. Since 
hydroxycarbamide is already in use in humans for a long time, the metabolism in humans is well 
understood. Therefore, this approach is considered acceptable, according to the EMA Guideline on the 
Non-Clinical Documentation for Mixed Marketing Authorisation Applications (CHMP/SWP/799/95, 2005), 
particularly given the extensive clinical experience with hydroxycarbamide. 
Toxicology 
Single dose, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive/developmental 
toxicity studies (Male Fertility, Female fertility, Embryo-foetal Development, Peri & postnatal) were 
presented in a tabular format, giving information for the species/sex/number/group, dose/route, 
duration/dosing period, major finding, NOAEL(mg/kg). Information concerning breastfeeding and 
adverse effects in the offspring was also adequately provided.   
Published studies in single dose toxicity studies considered hydroxycarbamide of low acute toxicity after 
oral administration in mice and rats. A single IV injection of hydroxycarbamide in male rabbits and BALB/c 
mice, revealed an early but transient significant decrease in blood erythrocyte count in rabbits and a 
marked hepatotoxicity in mice, suggesting that hydroxycarbamide could have initiated free radical 
mediated reactions. 
Repeated dose toxicity includes a 10-Day (Exploratory) Study in Rats, a 2-Week (Dose Range Finding) 
Study and a 1-Month Toxicity Study in Dogs, as well as the IARC monography and reports from veterinary 
practice with long-term treatment of dogs for up to 4 months. Study in rats ended with all animals in the 
highest dose group dead or euthanised. Clinical signs included reduction in body weight and food 
consumption. Necropsy revealed dark lungs in some female animals and gelatinous content or water 
content in small and large intestines of males and females; spleens and thymuses were also noted to be 
small. The cause of deaths and severe clinical signs in the 1,500 mg/kg/day dose group were not 
determined. The median dose group of 500 mg/kg/day exhibited decreased body weight gain, decreased 
circulating leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets, decreased cellularity of thymus, lymph nodes and 
bone marrow, and epithelial degeneration and/or dysplasia of the stomach and small intestine. Overall, 
the 50 mg/kg/day dose was considered as the no adverse effect level (rat NOAEL) due to haematologic 
findings that were of limited severity and not adverse, and the absence of clinical observations or 
microscopic findings.   
In the Dose Range Finding all animals in the medium and high dose groups were euthanised in moribund 
condition within hours of the first dose. Clinical signs in the medium (250 mg/kg/day) and high dose 
(1,000 mg/kg/day) group animals showed emesis, decreased activity, prostration, inability to rise, blue 
gums, salivation and ocular mucus accumulation. In the medium dose group of 250 mg/kg/day, blood 
oxygen saturation was evaluated due to clinical signs of prostration and blue gums suggesting low blood 
oxygenation and elevated erythrocyte mass parameters were consistent with haemoconcentration and 
shock. However, serum clinical chemistry and necropsies for dogs in the high dose group were not

conducted. The 50 mg/kg/day dose level was considered as the no adverse effect level (dog NOAEL) as 
the magnitude of clinical pathology changes were modest and not adverse. 
Results from 1-Month Toxicity Study in dogs showed that a dose of 50 mg/kg/day hydroxycarbamide 
administered in purified water once daily for 1 month was tolerated with no adverse clinical signs or 
effects on body weight, food consumption, or ophthalmic assessments. Haematology parameters showed 
decreased circulating leukocytes, erythrocytes and platelets, and microscopic evaluations showed 
increased bone marrow cellularity with decreased maturing granulocytes, increased creatinine activity 
and increased iron pigment in bone marrow and hepatic sinusoidal cells. Treatment with 
hydroxycarbamide did not show any changes in urinalysis, organ weight or macroscopic evaluations. 
According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 2000) monograph, the main toxicity 
of hydroxycarbamide is neutropenia. 
Reports from veterinary practice revealed that long-term treatment of dogs with hydroxycarbamide for 
up to 4 months with doses generally in the order of 30 mg/kg can lead to myelosuppression, 
gastrointestinal complications and, rarely, onychomadesis, which led to discontinuation of 
hydroxycarbamide therapy. Within a month of cessation of treatment, all nails had healed completely. 
Melanonychia, myelosuppression, and gastrointestinal have been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Carcinogenicity 
Conventional long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxycarbamide have not 
been conducted. However, hydroxycarbamide is presumed a trans-species carcinogen. Therefore, a 
carcinogenic risk to humans under the treatment with hydroxycarbamide cannot be excluded. This is 
reflected in the SmPC of the reference product Hydrea (hydroxycarbamide) and is adequately reflecting in 
the proposed in Sections 5.3 and Section 4.4 of the SmPC of Xromi 100 mg/mL oral solution.  
Section 5.3 (Preclinical safety data) of the proposed SmPC states the following, which is supported by the 
scientific literature: “Hydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic.” 
Hydroxycarbamide adversely affects reproductive performance in rats and causes testicular atrophy, 
reducing sperm production in male rats while high doses induce high incidence of resorptions in rats on 
Day 7-11 of gestation. In male mice, hydroxycarbamide at 500mg/kg b.w. causes up to 50% loss of 
testicular weight by day 29. Hydroxycarbamide crosses the placental barrier and damages embryos in 
rats. Repeated oral administration of hydroxycarbamide during the organogenesis period at dose levels 
ranging from 50-450 mg/kg b.w. leads to a dose-dependent embryo-lethal and teratogenic effect with an 
evident dose response relationship. Live foetuses at term generally show severe ocular and craniofacial 
anomalies; hydrocephalus, cardiovascular abnormalities, vertebral and costal defects. Rat embryos are 
teratogenically more sensitive to hydroxycarbamide than monkey embryos. 
Reproduction toxicity 
The National Toxicology Program (NTP) Centre for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction (2008) 
published the results of a review evaluating the potential for hydroxycarbamide to cause adverse effects 
on reproduction and development in humans. Following extensive review of the literature, the NTP 
concluded that there is “serious concern” that exposure of therapeutic doses of hydroxycarbamide to men 
(who have reached puberty) may affect sperm production, that there is “concern” that exposure of 
pregnant women to hydroxycarbamide could result in birth defects, abnormalities of foetal growth or 
abnormal postnatal development in offspring, and a “minimal concern” that exposure of therapeutic 
doses of hydroxycarbamide to children aged 5-15 years of age would adversely affect growth. 
The NTP found that hydroxycarbamide can cross the placenta and is found in breast milk and, as such, use 
of hydroxycarbamide in pregnancy/lactation could lead to exposure in the unborn child and infant.

In humans, hydroxycarbamide has been shown to affect spermatogenesis with cryptozoospermia and 
azoospermia, but the impact on fertility is not clear. These disorders are also associated with the 
underlying disease, as confirmed clinically. 
The reproductive effects noted in this pre-clinical study are reflected in human use and are included in 
existing product profiles and are included in sections 4.8 and 5.3 of the SmPC.  
With the evidence of teratogenic effects of hydroxycarbamide in the pre-clinical studies, 
Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories, 100 mg/mL oral solution is contraindicated in the pregnancy and 
breastfeeding and it documented in the Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories, 100 mg/mL oral solution 
SmPC (paragraph 4.6). 
Paediatrics 
Treatment of children is intended with hydroxycarbamide. It is not known if pharmacokinetics of 
hydroxycarbamide in children will show the same pattern as in adults. Since no juvenile toxicity studies 
with concomitant toxicokinetics were performed to compare possible toxicities and exposure levels of 
hydroxycarbamide, the safe use of hydroxycarbamide in children cannot be confirmed from the 
non-clinical point of view.  
The applicant addresses sufficiently the appropriateness of the proposed formulation for the paediatric 
population, taking into account the toxicological properties of the formulation excipients. 
Toxicokinetics 
No toxicokinetic analysis was provided based on the bibliographical toxicology package and the 
well-established use of hydroxycarbamide. 
Environmental Risk assessment 
The PECSURFACEWATER value is estimated to be above the limit of 0.01 μg/l.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
• 
The applicant should conduct an OECD 309 test on biodegradability and submit the results in 18 
months. In addition, the applicant should also conduct a full Phase II study including an OECD 308 
test with results to be provided in 3 years following approval of Xromi 100 mg/ml oral solution.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for Xromi oral solution containing hydroxycarbamide. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study with cross-over design under 
fasting conditions.  
Formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its current version is 
of particular relevance. 
Hydroxycarbamide was introduced into clinical practice soon after animal studies showed it was active 
against tumours in mammals. Hydroxycarbamide has been used for over 50 years in the oncology arena, 
due to its properties as a cytotoxic, antimetabolite, and antineoplastic agent, to treat a variety of medical 
disorders, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
Hydroxycarbamide has been used for over 30 years in the SCD arena, with the first clinical application in 
SCD patients reported in 1984, when Platt and colleagues demonstrated a rapid and dramatic increase in 
HbF-containing reticulocytes without significant bone marrow toxicity. 
Clinical studies 
A bioequivalence study has been conducted in healthy adults comparing the product under authorisation 
with the reference product Hydrea 500 mg capsules from UK and USA. The applicant has conducted this 
study in order to show bioequivalence between Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories 100 mg oral 
solution and Hydrea 500 mg capsules and bridge Hydrea-based literature with the product under 
authorisation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Bioequivalence study 
In view of this hybrid application to the reference products Hydrea 500 mg capsules (UK) and Hydrea 500 
mg capsules (USA), the focus of the clinical program to support the application of Oral Hydroxycarbamide 
Solution 500 mg/5 ml was to bridge the available clinical data from Hydrea 500 mg capsules (UK and 
USA) with a comparative three way cross-over PK study of single dose of Oral Hydroxycarbamide Solution 
500 mg/5 ml relative to the reference products in healthy volunteers. This bioequivalence study provides 
information on the comparative PK profiles used to support the appropriate dose of Hydroxycarbamide 
Oral Solution relative to Hydrea 500 mg capsules that would provide a comparable exposure to 
hydroxycarbamide compared to the reference product. 
The primary objective was to determine whether the test product, hydroxycarbamide oral 500 mg/5 ml 
solution and the two reference products, Hydrea 500 mg UK, and Hydrea 500 mg USA capsules were 
bioequivalent. For this purpose, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of hydroxycarbamide was compared 
after administration of a single dose of each of the 3 (test and 2 reference) formulations, under fasting 
conditions. The secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of the test product, 
hydroxycarbamide oral 500 mg/5 ml solution. 
Methods 
Study design  
The study design was chosen in accordance with the EMA and the USA Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) guidelines on the design, conduct and evaluation of bioavailability and bioequivalence studies. The 
study was carried out in healthy subjects in the fasted state. Each subject received in random order a 
single dose of hydroxycarbamide oral solution (500 mg/5 mL) (test IMP), Hydrea 500 mg capsule UK 
(reference IMP (B)) and Hydrea 500 mg capsule USA (reference IMP (C)), over 3 treatment periods (1 
IMP/period). 
The guidance required that sample collection should be spaced in such a way that Cmax and elimination 
rate constant (kel) can be accurately estimated. It was therefore important that there were enough 
sampling times clustered around Cmax. The guidance also required that sampling should continue for at 
least 3 t 1/2 of the drug, and that at least 3 to 4 samples should be obtained during the terminal log-linear 
phase. Hydroxycarbamide reaches Cmax in approximately 1 - 4 h. In patients with sickle cell disease Cmax 
is reached at approximately 1.2 h with an elimination t 1/2 of approximately 6 - 7 h. Therefore, collecting 
samples up to 24 h post-dose (day 2) was considered appropriate. The washout period of at least 3 days 
between doses (longer than the required 5 t 1/2), allowed complete elimination of hydroxycarbamide 
between each dose and was deemed sufficiently long to avoid any carry-over effect. 
As the primary objective of the study was to compare the bioavailability of 3 formulations of 
hydroxycarbamide, an open-label design was chosen. As the PK parameters investigated were objective, 
it was considered by the applicant that there was only minimal risk of introducing bias into the study. 
In the open label situation, the potential for bias remains a concern, in particular related to operational 
bias (e.g. influence on trial conduct/differential follow up of patients) and biased safety/tolerability 
assessment on the subject's as well as on the investigator's side. However, blinding of study staff is not 
required in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr 
**).  
The 3-period crossover design permitted within-subject comparison, which resulted in reduced variability 
of the data obtained. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 30/133 
 
 
 
A washout period of 3 days was considered adequate as this period exceeds more than 5-fold the half-life 
of hydroxycarbamide (elimination half-life of 6-7 hrs). This period is believed to be long enough to avoid 
any carry over effect to the second period.     
The study was conducted under fasting conditions considering that it is proposed that the product should 
be taken once daily, preferably in the morning before breakfast and, where necessary, with a glass of 
water or a very small amount of food.  
Monitoring was long enough (24h, approx. 3 t 1/2) to cover the plasma concentration-time curve and the 
sampling schedule provides a reliable estimate of the extent of exposure. AUC(0-t) covers at least 93% of 
AUC(0-∞). Healthy volunteers were treated with the same dose of hydroxycarbamide (500 mg) 
administered in three different formulations. This dose represents a single administration that would be 
used in clinical practice, therefore the dose selection is understood and agreed.   
A randomization scheme has been provided and subjects have been randomized to the six possible 
sequences ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CBA and CAB according to a randomization code produced by Simbec 
using the PROC PLAN procedure of SAS Version 9.3.   
Test and reference products  
Xromi 100 mg/ml manufactured by Nova Laboratories Ireland Limited (batch No. 1212d004, exp. date; 
27 March 2017) has been compared to Hydrea 500 mg manufactured by (Batch No: 6G03422 and Batch 
No: 5D03762, exp. date March 2018). 
Currently hydroxycarbamide is licensed as Hydrea 500 mg capsule in the UK and USA. Following advice 
from the CHMP at the EMA and the USA FDA, Hydrea 500 mg capsule UK and Hydrea 500 mg capsule USA 
were chosen as reference IMP (B) and (C), respectively. 
Population(s) studied   
Thirty (30) subjects aged between 18 and 50 years of age were enrolled in the bioequivalence study; 26 
male (86.7%) and 4 female (13.3%) subjects. 28 subjects received Test IMP (Hydroxycarbamide Oral 
solution), 30 subjects received Reference IMP (B) (Hydrea 500 mg capsule UK), 29 subjects received 
Reference IMP (C) (Hydrea 500 mg capsule USA), and 28 subjects completed the study per protocol and 
received all treatments. 
All demographic and background data were listed. Demographic data were summarised descriptively (age, 
height, weight and BMI) and by frequency (race and gender). Subject demographics (mean and SD) are 
also summarised in Table 7.

Analytical methods   
The certificates of analysis of test and reference products demonstrate that the assay values for the test 
product (102.3%) and reference product (98.9%) are within 5% of each other. 
The proposed inclusion and exclusion criterion are acceptable. No paediatric subjects were included in the 
study and this is agreed for a comparability exercise. 
Incurred samples reanalysis for the bioequivalence study (Study n° RD 729/26118) have been performed 
and the results have been provided by the applicant. Incurred sample reanalysis passed the standard 
conventional acceptance criteria (at least 67% of ISR samples that have reanalysed concentrations within 
20% of their original concentrations when normalized to their means). 
The applicant provided the requested Analytical Study Report with information on the method, 
instrumentation and statistical summaries, to demonstrate that the analytical method used for the 
determination of Hydroxyurea in human plasma was reproducible and accurate throughout the program 
of work. No repeat analysis was performed. In addition, an Analytical Study Report - Addendum 1 was 
also provided which contains representative chromatograms for 20% of the study data. 
Sample analysis was performed at Seirian Laboratories, Simbec Research Limited, Merthyr Tydfil, CF48 
4DR, United Kingdom. The provided analytical report describes the assay characteristics obtained during 
analysis of 1566 human plasma samples for Hydroxyurea from the clinical study conducted in healthy 
volunteers to determine the bioequivalence of the test product, hydroxycarbamide oral 500 mg/5 mL 
solution, and the two reference products, Hydrea 500 mg UK, and Hydrea 500 mg US capsules. 
Hydroxyurea was determined in human plasma, over the concentration range 0.50 to 99.09μg.ml-1 
(nominal concentrations) by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS), applying 
a suitable method that has previously been validated by Seirian Laboratories at Simbec Research Ltd. 
The study samples were processed in each batch as described in the Bioanalytical Phase Plan and table

The data provided in the submitted Analytical Study Report regarding the applied bioanalytical method 
and the representative chromatograms included in the Analytical Study Report - Addendum 1, can be 
considered adequate. Based on data from a previous study the intra-subject CV% for Cmax was 
approximately 22.12%, with a lower variability demonstrated for AUC. Using the method of Diletti a 
sample size of 22 subjects was considered sufficient to detect a 20% difference between the test and 
reference IMPs with a power of 80% and alpha of 5%, based upon a test/reference ratio of between 0.95 
and 1.05. To allow for a higher CV%, dropouts or subjects who otherwise failed to complete the study, 30 
subjects were enrolled in the study.

Pharmacokinetic variables  
The PK variables were derived from plasma hydroxycarbamide concentration-time data following 
administration of each IMP using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.4. Primary PK variables were Cmax, AUC0-t, and 
AUC0-inf, and secondary PK variables were Tmax, kel, t1/2, and AUC%extrap. Mean plasma concentration-time 
profiles for the 28 subjects who completed the study are shown in Figure 2:  
Figure 2: Mean Concentration-Time Profiles for Hydroxycarbamide following each IMP – 
Linear Scale 
Statistical methods   
Following logarithmic transformation Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf values were subjected to an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) including fixed effects for sequence, period, treatment, and subject (sequence). Point 
estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed for the contrasts between treatments 
using the residual mean square error obtained from the ANOVA. The point and interval estimates were 
back-transformed to give estimates of the ratios of the geometric least square means (LSmeans) and 
corresponding 90% CI. Estimated geometric means were also presented for each treatment group. 
Bioequivalence would be achieved if the 90% CI of the geometric mean ratios for Cmax and AUC fell within 
80.00% and 125.00%. An assessment of Tmax was performed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. 
The plasma PK parameters (Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Tmax, kel, t 1/2 and AUC%extrap) derived for 
hydroxycarbamide following administration of each IMP are summarised in Table 9 and the geometric 
LSmean test/reference ratios and corresponding 90% CI for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf that were 
calculated are presented in Table 10.

Table 10: Summary of statistical analysis of bioequivalence (Cmax, AUC 0-t, and AUC0-inf) 
The geometric LSmean test/reference ratio 90% CI calculated for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf, indicate that 
the test IMP is bioequivalent to reference IMP (B) and reference IMP (C) when administered fasted, with 
upper and lower limits contained within the acceptance interval of 80.00 – 125.00% (Table 11). 
However, the test Geometric LSmean value used for the calculation of the GMR LSmean test/reference 
ratio and corresponding 90% CI regarding Reference IMP (B) is different from that used regarding 
Reference IMP (C), for all 3 PK parameters (Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf).  
The Applicant stated that Guidance (e.g. EMA Guideline on The Investigation of Bioequivalence, 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr ** relevant section: Section 4.1.8) specifies that only data from 
the relevant treatment comparisons should be included in the statistical model (i.e. only the data from 
test and reference comparison being made and not the data from the second reference).  
As this is the case a separate model was fitted for each of Test (A) vs. Reference (B) and Test (A) vs 
Reference (C). LSMeans estimate means for a balanced population where the design is unbalanced, hence 
an adjustment is made based on the data and the factors in the analysis where the design is unbalanced. 
As the design was unbalanced (e.g. not an equal number of sequences), these estimates are slightly 
different as the models are different. 
Results 
A statistically significant reduction in Tmax was observed for the test IMP when compared to reference IMP 
(B) (p=0.0467), indicating faster rate of absorption, although there was no statistical difference in Tmax 
between the test IMP and reference IMP (C) (Table 11).

Geometric mean t 1/2 was similar between the test IMP and reference IMP (B) and (C) at 3.37, 3.40 and 
3.38 h, respectively, indicating little difference between the 3 formulations.  
AUC%extrap was ≤ 6.5% (geometric mean) for each IMP tested, indicating that AUC0-t covers at least 80% 
of AUC0-inf. Review of individual values demonstrated that 1 subject (subject 005) had AUC%extrap of 
20.9% following administration of reference IMP (C). This is likely the result of the fact that in this subject 
measurable plasma concentrations were detected up to 8 h post-dose following reference IMP (C), vs 18 
h post-dose for test IMP and reference IMP (B), thus resulting in flat elimination phase and was not 
considered to significantly affect interpretation of the data. 
No subjects were excluded from analysis due to protocol deviations. There were no major protocol 
deviations and it is unlikely that these deviations affected the interpretation of the study results. There 
was no concomitant medication reported during the study. Study conduct is acceptable. 
Information concerning intra-individual variability as observed during the bioequivalence study (Study n° 
RD 729/26118) has been adequately reported by the Applicant.

From the results of this bioequivalence study, the intra-subject variability (intra-subject CV%) has been 
provided for all pharmacokinetic parameters. For Cmax, the intra-subject variability was limited (from 
19.7% to 22.5%) and this intra-subject variability was low for AUC0-t (from 4.8% to 6.7%) as well as for 
AUC0-∞ (from 4.6% to 5.9%). 
The dissolution profiles of the UK reference product (Hydrea capsules) were performed at three different 
buffers: 0.1 M HCl (pH 1.3), acetate buffer (pH 4.5), and phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Hydrea capsules 
should be considered ‘very rapidly’ dissolving reference product since more than 85% of the labelled 
amount is dissolved with 15 min. Therefore, in view of its solubility, Hydrea capsules should be considered 
an appropriate reference product for the bioequivalence study (Study n° RD 729/26118) which compares 
this reference product with an oral solution test product (hydroxycarbamide Oral Solution 500 mg/5 mL).

Bioavailability 
Bioavailability is complete or nearly complete in cancer patients (Rodriguez et al, 1998, Tracewell et al, 
1995). 
Estepp et al (2016) reported on a prospective, open-label trial, investigating the PK of hydroxycarbamide 
in children (age range 2 – 17 years) following ingestion of an oral liquid (unlicensed, compounded) and/or 
capsule (Droxia) formulations, using frequent blood sampling. In Arm 1, toddlers (≥2 to ≤5 years) 
(n=17) received a single dose (mean 22.7 mg/kg) of a standardised liquid formulation of 
hydroxycarbamide (100 mg/mL). In Arm 2, children (>5 to ≤17 years) (n=22) received each 
standardised formulation (liquid and capsule) on separate occasions (mean dose 22.1 mg/kg) in a 
randomized, crossover fashion. Bioequivalence was demonstrated for the two formulations; there were 
no significant differences in systemic exposure between the two arms (mean Cmax liquid 37.4 mg/L vs 34 
mg/L; mean AUC0-inf liquid 104.5 vs 111.9 mg×h/L). Between liquid and capsule formulations the largest 
difference in the PK profiles was a trend towards a shorter time to peak concentration following ingestion 
of the liquid compared with the capsule, but that difference did not reach statistical significance (0.74 vs 
0.97 hours, p=0.14). Mean (SD) half-life was the same for both the liquid and capsule formulations, 2.3 
(0.5) hours. A population PK, 1-compartment model was developed and bodyweight was found to 
influence both the CL/F and V/F, and allometric (0.75) scaling accounted for the weight differences in

CL/F. Measures of systemic exposures (AUC- or CL/F-related) were not altered by formulation, suggesting 
dosing adjustments are not required when transitioning from one formulation to another. 
In order to demonstrate that different formulations have the same bioavailability and are bioequivalent, 
the applicant based its justification on the fact that Xromi is highly soluble and a permeable compound. In 
order to justify the high solubility, an in vitro solubility test was performed. The highest single dose 
administrated must be dissolved in 250 mL of buffers within the range of pH 1 to 6.8 at 37°C ± 1°C in 
order for a compound to be regarded as highly soluble. Hydroxycarbamide highest single dose is 3500 mg 
i.e. 35 mg/kg (maximum dose in Sickle Cell Disease) with an assumption of a large adult weighing 100 
kg). Therefore, a quantity of 4000 mg of hydroxycarbamide was added in 250 mL of buffers with pHs of 
1.3, 4.5, and 6.8 and put in a shaking bath. The vessels were rotated at 100 rpm for 24 h at 37°C ± 0.5°C. 
The results after 24 h showed that hydroxycarbamide had fully dissolved (see table below) confirming 
that the drug substance is highly soluble. 
Regarding hydroxycarbamide permeability, the Applicant refers to the Rodriguez et al (1998) study, 
where the absolute bioavailability of the substance was studied. Patients received Hydrea capsules or an 
IV infusion for 3 weeks and plasma concentration was measured. The mean absolute bioavailability was 
108%, confirming that hydroxycarbamide is a highly permeable compound. Figure 3 presents the 
similarity in PK profiles of oral and IV hydroxycarbamide formulations. 
Figure 3: PK profiles of oral and IV hydroxycarbamide formulations 
Xromi does not contain any excipients that will affect the rate or extent of absorption of the drug. The 
bioequivalence study performed showed that hydroxycarbamide is rapidly absorbed (Tmax 0.5-0.75 h), 
something that was also observed in the Estepp et al 2016 study.

Because hydroxycarbamide is a highly soluble and highly permeable compound, the Applicant argues that 
data from non-Hydrea literature may be used for the justification of the efficacy and safety of Xromi 100 
mg/ml oral solution. The Applicant identified the different formulations used in the main and supportive 
studies submitted. These were Droxia, Siklos, gelatin capsules filled with hydroxycarbamide drug 
substance, and compounded oral solutions. 
Therefore, to allow bridging of the non-Hydrea cited literature data to the reference Hydrea 500 mg 
capsule, and therefore Xromi (the proposed oral solution), dissolution studies have been conducted. 
Quality attributes and Dissolution profiles of hydroxycarbamide formulations identified in the treatment of 
SCD 
With regards to the quality attributes of hydroxycarbamide formulations, disintegration and dissolution 
were considered the most relevant parameters for consideration in bridging literature data to Hydrea 500 
mg capsules. 
Dissolution testing has been performed on the following comparator products using dissolution media at 
pH 1.3, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 (Table 14):

The dissolution profiles for Hydrea and the comparator formulations in three different media, covering the 
physiological pH range, show that dissolution from all formulations was rapid with the release of more 
than 85% of the labelled amount within 15 min (see Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3). Any small 
differences in profiles are linked to the disintegration times e.g. Siklos disintegrates very rapidly with 
almost complete dissolution in 5 minutes. In fact all the formulations are considered ‘very rapidly’ 
dissolving since at least 85% of labelled hydroxycarbamide has dissolved in 15 minutes. In these cases, 
similarity factor and difference factor calculations become unnecessary. (‘Where more than 85% of the 
drug is dissolved within 15 minutes, dissolution profiles may be accepted as similar without further 
mathematical evaluation.: Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence. CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1/ Corr **). 
Comparison of excipients in Hydrea and non-Hydrea formulations 
In addition to demonstrating similarity of in vitro dissolution profiles, an additional characteristic of 
formulations that must be taken into account to be certain about expected in vivo similarity of the 
formulations is the excipients. Thus, the excipients should not affect the gastrointestinal transit, 
absorption (dissolution, solubility, permeability) or in vivo stability of the active substance. 
The applicant does not believe that any of the excipients in Siklos or Droxia (the non-Hydrea formulations 
cited in clinical studies extrapolated to Hydrea) are likely to affects any of these processes in vivo. 
Excipients listed in Siklos 100 mg/1000 mg tablets 
All the excipients listed are commonly used in tablet formulations and can be found in many approved 
tablet products in the EU: 
Sodium stearyl fumarate 
Used as a tablet lubricant, and there is no data in the literature of incompatability with hydroxycarbamide 
(indeed since sodium stearyl fumarate is supplied in a purer form than alternatives such as stearic acid 
and magnesium stearate, chemical incompatibility is improved, Li et al 2014), and no known effects on 
absorption and bioavailability.  
Assessment report

Silicified microcrystalline cellulose 
Used as a filler/binder in the formulation of tablets, and there is no evidence in the literature of 
incompatability with hydroxycarbamide, and no known effects on absorption and bioavailability. 
Basic butylated methacrylate copolymer (film coating agents)  
Basic butylated methacrylate copolymer (BBMC) is used for film (protective) coating of tablets. It is a high 
molecular weight substance and is virtually not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral 
administration. BBMC becomes water-soluble by forming salts with acids; thus is soluble in gastric juice. 
Although there is some limited in vitro data that BBMC may affect membrane permeation of some low 
permeability compounds (apical to basal), such in vitro experiments are very difficult to extrapolate to the 
in vivo milieu, where the presence of mucous protein in the intestine is likely to attenuate any potential 
permeation effects (Grube et al 2008). Moreover, hydroxycarbamide is a highly soluble and highly 
permeable compound (with more or less 100% bioavailability) and therefore is unaffected by 
permeability enhancers.  
Excipients listed in Droxia capsules and Hydrea capsule 
Droxia 400 mg: 
citric acid 
lactose 
magnesium stearate 
sodium phosphate 
gelatin capsule: titanium dioxide 
colorants: 200 mg capsule (FD&C Blue No. 1 and FD&C Green No. 3), 300mg

(D&C Red No. 28, D&C Red No. 33, and D&C Yellow No. 10). 
Hydrea 500 mg capsules:

lactose monohydrate 
magnesium stearate 
sodium phosphate 
gelatin capsule: titanium dioxide, sodium laurilsulfate (lubricant) 
colorants: erythrosine, indigotine, yellow iron oxide, opacode S-1-8100 
The excipients blended with the active ingredient appear to be identical in both Droxia and Hydrea 
capsules. Although the chemical colourants of the gelatin capsule differ, they are approved in the EU/US 
and there is no reason to believe these colourants affect bioavailability.

As it was shown that hydroxycarbamide is a highly soluble and highly permeable drug, the discussed 
quality attributes of non-Hydrea formulations (dissolution tests and excipient description) mean that 
bridging can be done and non-Hydrea literature can be used to justify product’s efficacy/safety.  
Influence of age 
In adult SCA patients with normal renal function (n=7), the mean AUC0-inf after a single 15 mg/kg dose of 
hydroxycarbamide was 82.5 mg×h/L (Yan et al 2005). In a population PK study of children (median age 
10, range 5 -17 years) who received either a MTD dose (25-35 mg/kg) or initial starting dose (15-20 
mg/kg), the mean AUC0-inf was 101 and 105 mg×h/L, respectively (Wiczling et al 2014). De 
Montalembert et al (2006) compared hydroxycarbamide tablet pharmacokinetics in adults vs. children 
(aged 4 to 19 years) receiving equivalent weight normalized doses (mean 20.9 vs 21.9 mg/kg 
respectively). There was no significant difference in systemic exposure (Cmax; 24.5 vs 26.5 mg/L) or 
AUC0-inf (115.8 vs 128.4 mg×h/L). 
Rogers et al (2005) in an abstract reported limited PK data from an initial cohort of children (mean age 
14.5 months, range 12 – 18 months) recruited into the BABY HUG trial. The first dose PKs were obtained 
0, 1, 2, and 4 hours after administration of 20 mg/kg of an oral solution of hydroxycarbamide in 22 
consecutive patients. The reported Cmax (19.81±5.8 mg/L), and AUC (68.82±11.5 mg×hr/L) are 
estimated to be lower than equivalent doses administered to older children and adults in other studies, 
suggesting perhaps age-related differences in drug clearance (Rogers et al 2005). 
In the most recently reported study, Dong et al (2015), both bodyweight and Cystatin C (biomarker of 
renal function) were identified as influential covariates of clearance, but not age. Although a relationship 
between systemic exposure and response (effect on HbF, bone marrow suppression and clinical 
outcomes) has not been demonstrated for hydroxycarbamide, based on the data from children recruited 
into the HUSTLE trial, the authors suggested that a target AUC0-inf of 115 mg×h/L may be utilized to 
optimize dosing. However, they caution applying this target AUC to patients less than 2 years of age, on 
account of immature renal and hepatic function. 
Influence of weight 
The PK of hydroxycarbamide in children has been characterised through data collected from the 
Hydroxyurea Study of Long-Term Effects (HUSTLE, NCT00305175). A primary objective of this study was 
to determine the first-dose PK parameters for children commencing hydroxycarbamide treatment, using 
a fixed oral dose of 20 mg/kg. Subsequently, children underwent standardized dose escalation to MTD. A 
total of 712 hydroxycarbamide plasma concentrations from 96 patients after initial treatment (Day 1) 
were available for PK analysis. Among them, 63 patients had paired PK profiles after they had reached 
MTD. The age range of children recruited was 1.2 to 16.5 years. All participating subjects were given a 
single oral 20 mg/kg hydroxycarbamide dose (majority oral liquid). Patients then followed a dose 
escalation protocol with periodic monitoring of toxicity until individual MTD (range 14.2 to 35.5 mg/kg/d). 
Plasma samples were collected Day 1 and at MTD at the following times: pre-dose, and at 20 min, 40 min, 
1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after oral hydroxycarbamide administration. A population PK model was developed, 
which revealed bodyweight on clearance (Vmax) and Vd and Cystacin C (a measure of renal function) on 
clearance (Vmax), as the most significant covariates (Dong et al 2015). 
As mentioned above, De Montalembert et al (2006) showed that there was no significant difference in 
systemic exposure (Cmax; 24.5 vs 26.5 mg/L) or AUC0-inf (115.8 vs 128.4 mg×h/L) in adults vs children 
(aged 4 to 19 years) receiving equivalent weight normalized doses (mean 20.9 vs 21.9 mg/kg 
respectively).

Distribution 
The volume of distribution following oral dosing of hydroxycarbamide is approximately equal to total body 
water: adult values of 0.48–0.90 L/kg have been reported, whilst in children a population estimate of 0.7 
L/kg has been reported (Rodriguez et al 1998, Tracewell et al 1995, Gwilt et al 2003; Yan et al 2005, 
Wiczling et al 2014). 
Elimination 
Hydroxycarbamide is rapidly cleared from the circulation in cancer patients; with a mean half-life of 
approximately 3 h in adults (Rodriguez et al, 1998). Similarly, in children aged 9.6 ± 4.8 years, with SCA 
a mean half-life of 1.7 hours has been reported (Ware et al 2011). Hydroxycarbamide is cleared by both 
metabolism in the liver and unchanged through the kidney. In adults, urinary recovery of unchanged drug 
is reported to be approximately 40% of the oral dose when renal function is normal (Rodriguez et al, 
1998, Newman et al, 1997). In children, the fraction of hydroxycarbamide excreted into the urine was 
estimated to be about 50% (Wiczling et al, 2014). The total body clearance of hydroxycarbamide in adult 
patients with Sickle Cell disease is 0.17 L/h/kg (Paule et al 2011) and the respective value in children was 
similar, 0.22 L/h/kg (Wiczling et al, 2014). 
Excretion 
Hydroxycarbamide is known to be significantly cleared by the kidney (up to 50% excreted unchanged in 
urine) (Estepp et al 2016). In adults, urinary recovery of unchanged drug is reported to be approximately 
40% of the oral dose when renal function is normal (Rodriguez et al 1998, Newman et al 1997). In 
children, the fraction of hydroxycarbamide excreted into the urine was estimated to be about 50% 
(Wiczling et al 2014).  
Metabolism 
Recently, Kovacic et al (2011) described the biotransformation pathway(s) for hydroxycarbamide as well 
as the metabolites have been characterised. It appears that nitroxyl (HNO), the corresponding carboxylic 
acid and nitric oxide (NO) are metabolites: The first portion involves oxidation of hydroxycarbamide to a 
carbamoyl nitroso. Both horseradish peroxidase and catalase participate catalytically (catalase is found in 
the liver and erythrocytes too). The next transformation consists of hydrolysis of the intermediate to HNO 
and the corresponding carboxylic acid. NO is also generated (Kovacic et al 2011). Indeed NO is considered 
to play an important role in the treatment of SCD. Urea has also been postulated as one metabolite of 
hydroxycarbamide (Adamson et al 1965). 
In a rodent study, Andrae (1984) reported the involvement of cytochrome P450 dependant 
monooxygenases in the formation of HU genotoxic metabolites. This study was however performed on 
liver microsomes from rodents using high concentrations (25000 μM) of hydroxycarbamide not reflective 
of systemic concentrations observed in SCD (10 – 500 μM). Sassi et al, 2010, reported that 
hydroxycarbamide at 30, 100 and 300 μM is not metabolised in vitro by cytochrome P450s of human liver 
microsomes, nor is it a P-glycoprotein substrate. Hence, no interaction is to be expected in case of 
concomitant administration with substances being substrates of cytochromes P450 or P-glycoprotein 
(Sassi et al, 2010). 
Dose proportionality 
No data were presented by the applicant. There is relevant data in the literature showing that there is a 
nonlinear relationship between plasma hydroxyurea concentrations and dose for high doses, whereas for 
lower doses there is a linear relationship (Yan et al 2005).

Interactions 
Hydroxycarbamide is not metabolised in vitro by cytochrome P450s of human liver microsomes, nor is it 
a P-glycoprotein substrate (Sassi et al 2009). Hence, no interaction is to be expected in case of 
concomitant administration with substances being substrates of cytochromes P450 or P-glycoprotein. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
There is substantial interpatient variability in hydroxycarbamide pharmacokinetics. Cmax has been 
reported with a range of ≈20-40 μg/mL across different trials. Also, in Ware et al 2011 reference, 
substantial interpatient variability was observed for 87 children for all PK parameters. This interpatient PK 
variability may contribute to the observed response (HbF% levels) and dosing (MTD) variability. 
Impaired renal function 
Impaired renal function is a relatively frequent and serious complication in patients with SCD. These 
patients commonly develop proteinuria, which may progress to the nephrotic syndrome and end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD). As renal excretion is a pathway of elimination (normally approximately 50% of 
unchanged parent compound is recovered in urine), consideration should be given to decreasing the dose 
of hydroxycarbamide in patients with renal impairment.  
In an open single-dose study in adult patients with Sickle Cell disease (Yan et al, 2005) the influence of 
renal function on pharmacokinetics of hydroxycarbamide was assessed. Patients with normal renal 
function (creatinine clearance CLCr > 80 ml/min, n=7), mild (CLCr 60–80 ml/min, n=2), moderate 
(CLCr30 - 60 ml/min, n=3), or severe (CLCr < 30 ml/min, n=3) renal impairment, and End Stage Renal 
Disease (ESRD, n = 3), with 2 of them on maintenance haemodialysis. Except for patients with ESRD, all 
the patients received a 15-mg/kg single oral dose of hydroxycarbamide (Droxia capsules). Patients with 
ESRD received a 15 mg/kg oral dose of hydroxycarbamide on 2 occasions. Blood and urine samples were 
collected for the assessment of hydroxycarbamide pharmacokinetics. As the degree of renal impairment 
worsened, the systemic exposure to hydroxycarbamide increased, and the urinary recovery decreased. 
The mean AUC0-∞ was increased by 88%, 70%, 62%, 80%, and 152% for patients with mild, moderate, 
severe renal function impairment, and ESRD with and without hemodialysis, respectively, compared to 
patients with normal renal function. The changes in CLtotal/F, CL renal, and t 1/2 were also generally in keeping 
with this trend (i.e. higher exposure, lower clearance, and longer half-life). On the basis of the altered 
pharmacokinetic parameters in renally impaired patients, the authors proposed an initial dosing regimen 
of hydroxycarbamide (7.5 mg/kg/day) for SCD patients with CLCr < 60 mL/min. This dosing strategy is 
anticipated to provide a safe dose for SCD patients with renal impairment. However, since systemic 
exposure is likely to be unpredictable in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CLCr < 30 
ml/min), the use of hydroxycarbamide in such patients should be avoided. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics of hydroxycarbamide in hepatically impaired patients, 
but bearing in mind hepatic elimination is a significant component of overall elimination, perhaps up to 
60%, it is prudent to assume that clearance of hydroxycarbamide will be reduced in patients with severe 
liver dysfunction and therefore careful monitoring of response is required. Since systemic exposure is 
likely to be unpredictable in patients with severe hepatic impairment, the use of hydroxycarbamide in 
such patients should be avoided.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
It has long been recognised that raised HbF levels can ameliorate the clinical effects of SCD (Perrine 
1978; Platt 1994). HbF levels are high at birth and decrease over the first year of life and hence clinical 
manifestations are often delayed until the HbF levels decrease.  In addition, individuals who inherit high 
levels of HbF display a milder disease phenotype. This is because the HbF interferes with the polymer 
formation of the sickle haemoglobin within the red blood cell and because HbF reduces HbS concentration, 
but more importantly, it cannot enter the deoxy sickle haemoglobin polymer phase (Akinsheye et al 
2011). This polymerisation is the underlying pathology in SCD. The more HbF there is, the greater the 
inhibition. Post-natal, physiological decline of HbF reduces these protective effects. The spleen is affected 
earliest, typically in the first 1-2 years of life, but the kidney, brain, and other organs also begin to reflect 
sickle-related injury in early childhood from chronic and repeated sickling events. Hydroxycarbamide was 
first shown to raise HbF levels in SCD in the 1980s (Platt 1984; Veith 1985).   
Whilst disease manifestations are not always clinically evident, the abnormal sickled erythrocytes 
circulate continuously and cause repeated injury due to hypoxia/reperfusion events related to sickling. 
For these reasons, early intervention with disease-modifying treatments are warranted in children with 
SCA, even in the absence of obvious clinical signs and symptoms. Therapies designed to increase HbF 
levels are particularly attractive, since they offer direct intracellular protection against in vivo HbS 
polymerisation and sickling. HbF induction can therefore help prevent acute clinical complications of SCA 
such as pain and stroke, while also ameliorating the long-term complications related to chronic organ 
injury (McGann et al 2015).  
Hydroxycarbamide was chosen for studies of sickle cell disease because of its oral efficacy and low toxic 
effects, although other beneficial effects have subsequently emerged. Hydroxycarbamide was approved 
for the treatment of adults with SCA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997, and for both 
children (>2  years)  and  adults  by  the  European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2006. 
Information on pharmacodynamics is derived from the published literature, as no PD endpoint was 
investigated in the bioequivalence study. The applicant is referring to Letvin et al 1984, Platt et al 1984, 
Charache et al 1992, and Lavelle et al 2001 on the primary pharmacology of hydroxycarbamide. 
Mechanism of action 
Hydroxycarbamide’s mode of action is complex and can generally be categorised into two overlapping 
pathways: effects on HbF production and improved blood flow through reduced intercellular adhesion. 
The principal and most well understood mechanism of action of hydroxycarbamide in vivo is the reversible 
inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), a critical enzyme that converts ribonucleosides into 
deoxyribonucleosides, which are required for the synthesis and repair of DNA. Potent inhibition of RR 
leads to decreased intracellular pools of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates and impedes progression of 
cellular division through S phase. Temporary arrest of haematopoiesis through once-daily 
hydroxycarbamide results in altered erythroid kinetics upon recovery, inducing the so called “stress 
erythropoiesis.” Enhanced HbF production from intermittent mild marrow toxicity is believed to stem from 
the steady shifting of marrow physiology to the stressed state. The marrow responds to the repetitive 
pharmacological injury of daily use by enhanced erythropoiesis and increased HbF production. 
Paradoxically, the net effect of marrow toxicity is induced HbF and stabilization of cellular haemoglobin 
solubility. HbF inhibits intracellular HbS polymerization and prevents the sickling process within 
erythrocytes. These effects lead to decreased levels of RBC membrane damage and haemolysis (Green et 
al, 2014). RBCs with more HbF are larger (higher MCV) and more deformable (better rheology) (McGann 
et al, 2015). Hydroxycarbamide appears to influence RBC–endothelial interactions. Decreased expression 
of RBCs, white blood cells, and endothelial integrins and other adhesion molecules probably improves 
microvascular blood flow and reduces proinflammatory cell–cell interactions. Hydroxycarbamide may also

reduce cellular adhesion in general and/or adhesion provoked by infection or inflammation (Penkert et al 
2017). Integrins and other cell surface glycoproteins regulate neutrophil migration and RBC flow through 
endothelial interactions. In a murine model for SCD and pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis, 
hydroxycarbamide provided some protection by decreasing the recruitment of neutrophils into infected 
lungs. Mice genetically engineered to lack E-selectin were not protected by hydroxycarbamide, 
strengthening the view that hydroxycarbamide effects may also be HbF-independent. Hydroxycarbamide 
also decreases the degree of chronic inflammation (as seen by the decrease in white cells and platelets) 
and may also stimulate nitric oxide (NO) production as an NO donor or through stimulation of 
intermediates, facilitating vasodilation (Green et al, 2014; McGann et al, 2015). 
Primary pharmacology 
In the 1980s, to determine whether hydroxycarbamide, a cytotoxic/cytostatic drug that does not 
influence DNA methylation, might stimulate HbF synthesis, two juvenile Cynomolgus monkeys were 
phlebotomised to induce anaemia and reticulocytosis and then treated with hydroxycarbamide. 
Immediately after phlebotomy was initiated, there was a rise in the level of F cells (erythrocytes with 
measurable HbF), which stabilised at an average value of 13% in one animal and 20% in the other during 
a two-month control period. Foetal haemoglobin gradually rose from undetectable values before bleeding 
to 3% in one animal and 5% in the other. Sixty-two days after initiation of phlebotomy, 
hydroxycarbamide (50 mg/kg/day for five days) induced only a small and transient increase in F cells and 
HbF. Two weeks later, however, a similar course (100 mg/kg/day) resulted in a prompt and dramatic 
increase in both indexes. These results strongly suggested that hydroxycarbamide (an S-phase–specific 
cytotoxic) increases HbF by a mechanism that does not involve inhibition of DNA methylation (Letvin et al 
1984). 
The effect of treatment with a combination of erythropoietin (EPO), stem cell factor (SCF) and 
hydroxycarbamide on HbF levels, F-cell numbers, and globin chain synthesis was evaluated in a baboon 
model (Lavelle et al 2001). The combination of SCF+EPO+hydroxycarbamide resulted in an additional 
two-fold increase in HbF, whereas F-cells and F-reticulocytes increased only 25% compared to the SCF + 
EPO regimen.  
The first clinical application of hydroxycarbamide for patients with SCA was reported in 1984, when  Platt  
and  colleagues  demonstrated  a  rapid  and  dramatic  increase  in  HbF-containing reticulocytes without 
significant bone marrow toxicity (Platt et al 1984). Many cytotoxic drugs increase HbF concentrations, 
which is beneficial in patients with sickle cell disease.  
Over the last 30 years, following a series of ‘proof of principle’ experiments, phase 1-3 studies in adults 
and children with SCA treated with hydroxycarbamide at maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and which 
demonstrated significant dose-dependent increases in Hb and HbF along with concurrent reduction in 
total WBC, neutrophils, and reticulocytes and reduction in haemolysis, hydroxycarbamide has become 
established as a disease modifying therapy (McGann et al 2011a).  
The effects of hydroxycarbamide are dose dependent, and many clinical trials have demonstrated that the 
laboratory and clinical benefits of hydroxycarbamide are optimized when escalated to MTD. Charache et 
al 1992 studied the hydroxycarbamide dose-response curve in 49 patients and reported an increase in 
%HbF and %F cells with increasing doses, approaching an asymptote at around 35 mg/kg/day. Mean MTD 
was 22.1 mg/kg (range 15-35 mg/kg/day). MTD is defined as a stable and tolerated dose (mg/kg/day) 
that achieves a target range of mild marrow suppression, most commonly determined by the absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) but also by the absolute reticulocyte count (ARC).  
At MTD, almost all patients with SCA have a significant increase in the total Hb concentration and the 
mean corpuscular volume (MCV), but the laboratory benefits of hydroxycarbamide are most often defined 
by the amount of HbF achieved. All children with good adherence will respond to hydroxycarbamide, but

there is substantial interpatient variability in both the MTD itself and the %HbF levels achieved. For 
example, some patients tolerate an MTD as high as 35 mg/kg/day before reaching appropriate 
myelosuppression, while others can only tolerate a dose of 15 mg/kg/day. Similarly, some patients 
achieve HbF levels greater than 40%, while others are never able to reach 20%. These observations 
suggest important individual pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics differences 
that contribute to the phenotypic variability in both the dosing and response to hydroxycarbamide 
therapy (McGann and Ware 2015).  
Secondary pharmacology 
Hydroxycarbamide is also used in solid tumours, polycythaemia vera, chronic myelogenous leukaemia 
and psoriasis. The mechanism of its cytoxic and antineoplastic effect is through interference with the 
synthesis of DNA without interfering with the synthesis of RNA or protein. 
The principal and most well understood mechanism of action of hydroxycarbamide in vivo is the reversible 
inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), a critical enzyme that converts ribonucleosides into 
deoxyribonucleosides, which are required for the synthesis and repair of DNA. Potent inhibition of RR 
leads to decreased intracellular pools of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. The drug is an S-phase 
inhibitor and may cause cells to arrest at the G1—S border, decrease the rate of cell progression into the 
S phase, and/or cause cells to accumulate in the S phase as a result of inhibiting DNA synthesis (AHFS 
Hydroxycarbamide monograph). 
Animal studies indicate that the cytotoxic effects of hydroxycarbamide are limited to those tissues with 
high rates of cellular proliferation and the effects are evident only in those cells that are actively 
synthesizing DNA. Hence it is predictable that myelosuppression, gastrointestinal and cutaneous effects 
are commonly observed following chronic hydroxycarbamide therapy (AHFS Hydroxycarbamide 
monograph). 
Neutropenia is the first and most common manifestation of haematological suppression, while 
thrombocytopenia/anaemia occurs less frequently and is rarely seen without a preceding neutropenia. 
Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is discontinued (typically 1 week of 
therapy cessation) (Strouse et al 2012). Treatment can then be re-initiated at a lower dose.  
Although hydroxycarbamide-induced myelosuppression usually is put to therapeutic use in patients with 
polycythaemia vera, dose-dependent myelotoxicity can occur during therapy with the drug in such 
patients (Parasuraman et al 2016). The risk of clinical toxicity generally can be minimised by adequate 
monitoring and titration of dosage (e.g., by reducing hydroxycarbamide dosage and increasing the use of 
supplemental phlebotomy if necessary). Despite good long-term haematologic control, thrombotic 
episodes can occur in patients receiving hydroxycarbamide for polycythaemia vera. However, some 
evidence indicates that the risk of thrombotic complications is reduced overall compared with phlebotomy 
therapy alone in patients with this disease, at least during for the first several years of such therapy 
(AHSF hydroxycarbamide monograph). Hydroxycarbamide is also thought to work in psoriasis by 
inhibiting rapidly dividing skin cells (Ranjan et al 2007). 
Self-limiting megaloblastic erythropoiesis is often seen soon after the initiation of hydroxycarbamide 
therapy and becomes less pronounced as therapy continues (AHSF hydroxycarbamide monograph). The 
morphologic change resembles pernicious anaemia but is not related to vitamin B12 or folic acid 
deficiency and is not necessarily accompanied by anaemia. Hydroxycarbamide-induced macrocytosis may 
mask incidental folic acid deficiency, and hence prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended 
(AHSF hydroxycarbamide monograph). Haemolysis and decreased serum iron values have also been 
reported. Hydroxycarbamide may delay plasma iron clearance and reduce the rate of iron utilisation by 
the erythrocytes, but it does not appear to alter the red blood cell survival time (AHSF hydroxycarbamide 
monograph).

Patients with previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy have an increased risk for myelosuppression; 
monitoring is recommended and dose reduction or discontinuation may be required. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
Potentially fatal pancreatitis and severe peripheral neuropathy have been reported in HIV patients who 
received hydroxycarbamide in combination with antiretroviral drugs, particularly didanosine plus 
tavudine. Median decline in CD4 cells of approximately 100/mm3 is also reported with concomitant use. 
(Bloch et al 2016, Halvir et al 2001, Rutschmann et al 1998, Rutschmann et al 2000, Swindells et al 
2005).  
Also concurrent use of hydroxycarbamide and other myelosupressive products or radiation therapy may 
increase bone marrow depression, gastrointestinal disturbance and mucositis. Erythema caused by 
radiation may be aggravated by hydroxycarbamide (Lerner et al 1977). 
Cutaneous vasculitis toxicities including ulcerations and gangrene are more reported in patients with 
myeloproliferative disorder if hydroxycarbamide is used concomitantly with interferon therapy or used in 
patient with prior exposure to interferon therapy. (Hydrea Label). 
Concomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the 
vaccine virus and/or increase the adverse drug reaction of the vaccine virus, because normal defence 
mechanisms may be suppressed by hydroxycarbamide therapy. Compared with placebo, 
hydroxycarbamide treatment resulted in significantly lower total lymphocyte, CD4, and memory T-cell 
counts (Lederman et al 2014). It may result in severe infections and hence concomitant therapy is to be 
avoided 
(https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/live-attenuated-vaccines-avoid-use-in-those-who-areclinicall
y-immunosuppressed). In addition, cytotoxics suppress antibody levels against vaccinepreventable 
diseases, reducing vaccine efficacy and subdued response to (re-)vaccination in children is a possibility 
(Tilburg et al 2006). 
Genetic differences in PD response 
SCD is a term that includes different genotypes (HbSS, HbSC, HbSβ0, HbSβ+ account for most SCD in 
Europe). Pharmacogenomics differences contribute to the phenotypic variability in both the dosing and 
response to hydroxycarbamide therapy. Ware et al 2011 (described as key study by the Applicant during 
the Scientific Advice phase) report SNPs that could affect PD response. It would have been very 
informative if the Applicant had discussed this section in more detail, explaining if and how genetic 
differences affect PD response. However, this is not expected to affect the intended clinical use of the 
product or the target population. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Charache et al (1992) showed that the effects of hydroxycarbamide are dose dependent. They studied the 
hydroxycarbamide dose-response curve in 49 patients and reported an increase in %HbF and %F cells 
with increasing doses, approaching an asymptote at around 35 mg/kg/day. Mean MTD was 22.1 mg/kg 
(range 15-35 mg/kg/day). Subsequently many clinical trials have demonstrated that the laboratory and 
clinical benefits of hydroxycarbamide are optimised when escalated to MTD.  
In a recent report from the Hydroxyurea Study of Long-Term Effects (HUSTLE), a prospective 
observational study (NCT00305175) with a primary goal of describing the long-term effects of 
hydroxycarbamide therapy in children with SCA, in children receiving hydroxycarbamide therapy 
escalated to MTD, higher % HbF levels conferred greater protection against hospitalisation for severe 
vaso-occlusive pain VOC or ACS. In 230 children, providing 610 patient-years of follow up, the mean 
attained HbF% at MTD was >20% for up to 4 years of follow-up. When HbF% values were ≤20%, children 
had twice the odds of hospitalisation for any reason (P<0.0001), including VOC (P<0.01) and ACS 
Assessment report

Page 52/133 
 
 
 
(P<0.01), and more than four times the odds of admission for fever (P<0.001). Thirty day readmission 
rates were not affected by HbF%. Neutropenia (ANC<1000×106/L) was rare (2.3% of all laboratory 
monitoring), transient, and benign. Therefore, attaining HbF >20% was associated with fewer 
hospitalisations without significant toxicity. These data support the use of hydroxycarbamide in children, 
and suggest that the preferred dosing strategy is one that targets an HbF endpoint >20% (Estepp et al 
2017). 
Although a target therapeutic concentration (related to HbF, bone marrow suppression or clinical 
outcomes) has not been demonstrated for hydroxycarbamide, based on the data from children recruited 
into the HUSTLE trial, the authors suggested that a target AUC0-inf of 115 mg×h/L may be utilised to 
optimise dosing. 
2.4.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Despite the robust laboratory and clinical benefits from hydroxycarbamide treatment for SCA, substantial 
phenotypic variation is observed; for example, the %HbF achieved in young patients at 
hydroxycarbamide MTD ranges from a low of 10%-15% to a high that occasionally exceeds 40% HbF. 
Additional phenotypic variability is observed in the MTD itself; some patients tolerate hydroxycarbamide 
at a dose of only 10-15 mg/kg/d before developing dose-limiting myelosuppression (typically ANC and 
ARC), whereas others tolerate 30-35 mg/kg/d without excessive myelosuppression. In many cases, a 
lower MTD limits the efficacy of hydroxycarbamide but not always; some patients have remarkable HbF 
responses despite a relatively low MTD. Most of this phenotypic variability observed with 
hydroxycarbamide treatment in SCA remains unexplained at this time, although clinically relevant 
differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics of hydroxycarbamide have 
been postulated (Ware et al 2011). 
Individualisation of hydroxycarbamide dosing 
Presently, dosing in adults is individualised to the MTD (to a max of 35 mg/kg/day), through careful 
incremental dose increases, cautious monitoring of haematology and the HbF response. In children, too, 
hydroxycarbamide is initiated at a relatively low dose (15 -20 mg/kg) and slowly escalated to MTD 
(maximum 35 mg/kg) to reach a goal of mild myelosuppression. Using this dose escalation strategy, MTD 
is reached in approximately 6-12 months.  
This individualised dosing approach has been reported in the pivotal RCTs and observations studies in 
adults and children (>2 years): MSH (pivotal RCT study of hydroxycarbamide in adults with SCA), 
Paediatric Belgian Trial, SWiTCH, TWiTCH. 
The pivotal RCT in children < 2 years (BABY HUG) and the first phase of the HUSOFT study utilised a fixed 
dose of 20 mg/kg without escalation, demonstrating efficacy and safety, and a positive risk-benefit 
profile. In HUSTLE, the initial dose was 20 mg/kg/day and then a dose escalation protocol was followed 
with periodic monitoring of toxicity until individual MTD was reached. The findings from these studies 
(benefit in hematologic results and the relative lack of toxicity) closely resemble those seen in the adult 
MSH study and studies in older children.  
Hence, although PK/PD studies have not been conducted, the efficacy/safety data to date suggest that 
the therapeutic dose range (margin) is not significantly different across the age range: infants, older 
children and adults. Figure 4 shows the range of doses tested in the pivotal trials, and overlaid are the

hypothetical PK-PD curves for efficacy and safety. It should be emphasized that evidence beyond a dose 
of 35 mg/kg is not available.

curves), Approved Dose in the EU and Pivotal Doses Tested in Clinical Trials in Infants, Children and Adults 
Main studies  
Three studies (384 adults and children with HbSS or HbSβºthal) compared hydroxycarbamide to placebo, 
recruiting individuals with severe disease (Charache et al 1995; Belgian Study 1996; Jain 2012). There 
were statistically significant improvements in terms of pain alteration (using measures such as pain crisis 
frequency, duration, intensity, hospital admissions and opioid use), measures of foetal haemoglobin and 
neutrophil counts and fewer occurrences of ACS and blood transfusions in the hydroxycarbamide groups. 
There were no consistent statistically significant differences in terms of quality of life and adverse events 
(including serious or life-threatening events). Seven deaths occurred during the studies, but the rates by 
treatment group were not statistically significantly different. In the TWiTCH study, hydroxycarbamide was 
compared with transfusion in children with abnormal TCD velocities who had received transfusion for at 
least one year and had no evidence of vasculopathy on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (TWiTCH 
2015). Hydroxycarbamide was as effective as transfusion in preventing further stroke and final TCD 
velocity was lower in the hydroxycarbamide group. Table 15 summarises the four main studies.

Multicentre Study of Hydroxycarbamide in Sickle Cell Anaemia (MSH study, 
Charache et al 1995) 
The MSH study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 299 adults with SCA 
who had experienced three or more VOCs in the previous year. The clinical end point of three or more 
documented VOCs was chosen because of earlier data documenting that people who experience pain at 
that frequency had markedly lower survival rates. The trial was conducted to test the hypothesis that 
hydroxyurea could substantially reduce the frequency of painful crises (often called vaso-occlusive crises, 
VOCs) in adults with SCA. Because of the beneficial effects observed, the trial was stopped before the 
planned 24 months of treatment were completed for all patients. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
The study group was composed of four central units located in Baltimore (a central office, a data 
coordinating center, a treatment distribution center, and a core laboratory) and a consortium of 21 clinics 
in the United States and Canada. Most of the study clinics were in the eastern United States, with the 
largest in Chicago. Several drew on patients from rural areas, in some cases using satellite facilities to 
increase patient participation in the study. All clinics were associated with academic medical centers. 
There were similar numbers of men (148) and women (151), and 95% of them identified themselves as 
black. More than half were 18-29 years of age. Almost all had completed high school. Public medical 
assistance plans provided medical care for most MSH patients. For the group as a whole, during the 
28-day run-in period, medical contacts were reported on 11% of the days (Charache et al 1995b). 
To be eligible, the patients had to be at least 18 years old and had to have sickle cell anemia; patients 
known to have sickle cell–b-thalassemia and sickle cell–b°-thalassemia were excluded, but those with 
sickle cell–a-thalassemia were not. If patients had received transfusions, hemolysates of their red cells 
could not contain more than 15% hemoglobin A at the time treatment was initiated. The patients had to 
have reported at least three crises to the study physician in the year before entry into the study; for 
purposes of eligibility, documentation of crises was not necessary. There was no upper limit on the 
number of crises per year. 
Other reasons for exclusion from the study included pregnancy; known narcotic addiction or regular 
consumption of more than 30 oxycodone capsules (or the equivalent) every two weeks; participation in a 
long-term program of transfusion; concurrent treatment with another potential antisickling agent; 
pretreatment blood counts that could not be distinguished from levels considered to indicate marrow 
depression; a history of stroke during the preceding six years; prior hydroxyurea therapy; and the 
presence of antibody to the HIV. 
Treatments 
After an initial four-week run-in period, during which only folic acid tablets were dispensed, the patients 
were randomly assigned to a treatment group. Hydroxyurea (provided in powder form by Bristol-Myers 
Squibb) and placebo (Starch 1500) were encapsulated by John Hopkins Manufacturing Pharmacy into 
200-mg and 500-mg capsules and dispensed to the clinics by the treatment distribution center. Patients 
assigned to hydroxyurea received an initial dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, and the 
dose was increased by 5 mg per kilogram per day every 12 weeks, unless marrow depression (indicated 
by a neutrophil count below 2000 per cubic millimeter, a reticulocyte or platelet count below 80,000 per 
cubic millimeter, or a hemoglobin level below 4.5 g per deciliter) was present. If marrow depression 
occurred, treatment was stopped until blood counts recovered; it was then resumed at a dose that was 
2.5 mg per kilogram lower than the dose associated with marrow depression, starting a new 12-week

cycle. The dose of placebo was adjusted by the data coordinating center in a similar manner in order to 
maintain blinding. All patients were given 1 mg of folic acid per day. At each follow-up visit, the capsules 
were counted and patients were asked whether they had had any adverse effects.  
The patients were seen every two weeks, and blood samples were shipped to Baltimore and analysed at 
Johns Hopkins Hospital. Fetal hemoglobin and red cells containing fetal hemoglobin (F cells) were 
assayed, dense cells were counted, and a-globin and b-globin DNA were analyzed (at the Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center, Jackson, Miss.) according to previously described methods. 
Objectives 
The Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH) was designed to determine if 
treatment with orally administered HU, in maximal tolerated doses, could decrease by at least 50% the 
frequency of painful crises in patients with moderate to severe SS disease. A parallel (rather than a 
crossover) design was chosen not only because it might lead to a faster answer, but because of 
uncertainties over the appropriate duration of a “washout” period between treatments. Secondary 
objectives included an examination of the relationship of HbF levels to the occurrence of crises and an 
evaluation of the effect of treatment on the quality of patients’ lives (Charache et al 1995b). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
A painful crisis was defined as a visit to a medical facility that lasted more than four hours for acute 
sickling-related pain (hereinafter referred to as a medical contact), which was treated with a parenterally 
administered narcotic (except for a few facilities in which only orally administered narcotics were used); 
the definition is similar to that used in a previous study. The measurement of the length of the visit 
included all time spent after registration at the medical facility, including the time spent waiting to be seen 
by a physician. The occurrence of chest syndrome (chest-wall pain in association with findings of a new 
pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray films and fever), priapism, and hepatic sequestration (a sudden 
increase in liver size associated with pain in the right upper quadrant, a decrease in the hemoglobin 
concentration of at least 2 g per deciliter, and more abnormal results of liver-function tests not due to 
biliary tract disease) was considered a crisis; the occurrence of hematuria and exacerbations of chronic 
pain was not. 
Because painful crises are both the most distressing acute feature of SCD and the presumed cause of later 
organ damage, the MSH selected a reduction in the frequency of crises as the subject of the primary 
analysis. Preexisting organ damage cannot be reversed and it did not seem likely that advancing vascular 
compromise could be reversed in a relatively short trial. Therefore, the primary analysis does not count 
such complications as pulmonary, cardiac, or renal failure; ankle ulcers; and aseptic necrosis of bone.  
Not all patients respond to therapy; treatment (and some form of monitoring for bone marrow 
depression) must continue lifelong if benefits are to be maintained; the risks of teratogenicity, 
mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity are not clearly defined; and the cost of treatment, while less than the 
cost of illness, is not trivial. It was considered that hydroxyurea treatment would have to make a large 
change in crisis frequency to be considered worthwhile. A difference of 50% in crisis attack rate between 
the two treatment arms was specified as a clinically important difference which the trial should detect if 
hydroxyurea is to be considered effective (Charache et al 1995b). 
Sample size 
Study size was based on power calculations for a test of differences in normally distributed means. It was 
assumed that (1) at most 10% of patients will be lost to observation for crises and the losses would be 
comparable in the two treatment arms; (2) in addition to those lost, 10% of patients assigned to receive 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 57/133 
 
 
 
hydroxyurea will not take study treatment, and these patients will experience the same crisis rates as 
placebo patients; (3) the effect of hydroxyurea on crises will increase linearly during the first year of study 
participation (during dose titration), and the full effect will be reached at 1 year after initiation of therapy 
for all patients. Because the normal scores test always has the same or greater power than the t-test, 
power calculations for a t-test offer conservative and convenient estimates of study power. 
A stringent criterion (a 50% overall reduction in crisis attack rate) was chosen for efficacy. Data from a 
previous study (Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease) suggested that increasing HbF to 15 % might be 
associated with a 50% reduction, and a mean final HbF level of 15% was achieved in a preliminary study 
with hydroxyurea. Unpublished data from that study suggested that among adult patients with at least 
three crises in a given year, the mean number of crises (± 1 SD) would be 6.3 (± 6.6). Assuming the 
standard deviation for crises over 2 years will remain approximately equal to the mean and that a 25 % 
reduction will be present in both groups because of a placebo effect, the mean number (and SD) of crises 
during the 2-year follow-up was estimated to be 9.4 in the placebo group. Assuming that the effect of 
treatment increases until MTD is reached among patients assigned to hydroxyurea and that there is a 
50% reduction in crises once MTD is attained, their mean number of crises over 2 years was estimated as 
5.9. If 10% of patients did not take study treatment, the mean in the hydroxyurea group would be 6.2 and 
the SD would be 6.4. Assuming in addition that 10% of patients would be lost at random to follow up, at 
a=0.05 enrolling 150 patients into each treatment group will give the study approximately 90% power to 
detect a 50% reduction in crisis rate after MTD is achieved. If the reduction in crisis rate is only 40%, with 
the same number of patients power would be approximately 0.72; if 20% of the patients do not take 
study treatment and the reduction in crisis rate is 50%, power would be 0.87. The recruited population 
(299 patients) is expected to be satisfactory for the analyses planned (Charache et al 1995b). 
Randomisation 
Not available. 
Blinding (masking) 
Neither the patients nor the investigators and staff members at the clinical sites were aware of the 
patients’ treatment assignments. Because knowledge of repeated measurements of a patient’s MCV or 
fetal hemoglobin level might make the treatment assignments apparent to staff members, such 
measurements were made at the central laboratory. Clinic staff members agreed not to look at the results 
of tests requested by other clinicians at their institutions. Treatment assignments could be revealed if 
knowledge of the assignment would alter a patient’s subsequent medical care (e.g., if a patient or a 
patient’s partner became pregnant). In such cases, the study treatments were stopped, but the 
researchers continued to follow the patients and to count their crises. 
Statistical methods 
All patients were included in the primary analysis according to their original treatment assignments. 
Treatment groups were compared on the basis of annual crisis rates. The primary end-point analysis was 
to be a two-sided comparison at an overall alpha level of 0.05. 
Annual rates were computed by dividing the number of crises by the number of years elapsed (e.g., 6 
crises in 1.9 year=3.16 crises per year). To test the effect of treatment on the crisis rate, the patients 
were ranked according to the number of crises they had had per year for observed periods of up to two 
years. Death was considered the worst outcome, followed by a stroke (defined as a documented new 
neurologic deficit lasting more than 24 hours, confirmed by a neurologist) or the institution of long-term 
transfusion therapy (more than four months); outcomes for all other patients were ranked according to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 58/133 
 
 
 
the individual crisis rate. These ranks were used to compare the two treatment groups (Van der 
Waerden’s test). A rank statistic was planned for the primary analysis because it was expected to have 
more power to detect differences and to be less influenced by extreme values than a t-test of the means. 
Four interim analyses were planned to be conducted every six months after enrolment began. To take into 
account multiple examinations of the data, a P value of less than 0.001 was specified for the differences 
between groups to reject the null hypothesis at each of the planned interim analyses, and a P value of less 
than 0.046 was required at the final analysis. 
In secondary analyses, for discrete variables, chi-square tests were used to compare the frequency of 
specific characteristics. For continuous data, mean values were compared by analysis of variance and 
linear regression. Cumulative event rates were estimated by the product-limit (Kaplan–Meier) method, 
and the log-rank statistic was used to compare the distributions of events over time. An interaction term, 
testing whether the effect of hydroxyurea changed with time, was assessed by Cox proportional-hazards 
models. To adjust for multiple tests of the data in secondary analyses, two-sided tests with P values 
between 0.01 and 0.001 were considered to provide some evidence of significant differences between 
groups, and tests with P values below 0.001 were considered to provide strong evidence of such 
differences. 
Formulations 
Hydroxyurea (provided in powder form by Bristol-Myers Squibb) and placebo (Starch 1500) were 
encapsulated by Johns Hopkins Manufacturing Pharmacy into 200-mg and 500-mg capsules and 
dispensed to the clinics by the treatment distribution center. 
A board appointed by the NHLBI approved the protocol, reviewed each clinic’s consent form, provided 
advice, and oversaw patient safety and the progress of the study. The board was composed of four 
hematologists, two biostatisticians, an ethicist, and an educator–patient advocate. It was empowered to 
recommend the discontinuation of the study and did so when interim analyses showed hydroxyurea to be 
effective. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The published paper did not provide details on the participant flow. From the 299 patients enrolled in the 
trial, 279 (93%) were being seen regularly for follow-up visits at the clinics and 5034 medical contacts 
(occurring during two years of follow-up). 
Recruitment 
The treatment started on January 28, 1992. As of June 30, 1994 (10 months before the planned end of 
the study), 279 of the 299 patients who were enrolled (93 percent) were being seen regularly for 
follow-up visits at the clinics and 5034 medical contacts (occurring during two years of follow-up). 
Baseline data 
There were no significant differences between the two groups of patients with respect to sex, age, race or 
ethnic group, number of a-globin genes, or b-globin haplotype, and blood counts in the two groups were 
similar before treatment was begun. After treatment had begun, one patient in the hydroxyl urea group 
was discovered to have sickle-cell–b+-thalassemia (a small amount of hemoglobin A was present). Table 
16 presents the baseline patient characteristics.

Outcomes and estimation 
As of June 30, 1994, 279 of the 299 patients who were enrolled (93%) were being seen regularly for 
follow-up visits at the clinics and 5034 medical contacts (occurring during two years of follow-up) had 
been classified. The ranks of the crisis rates differed in the two treatment groups, with median rates of 2.5 
crises per year in the hydroxyurea group and 4.5 crises per year in the placebo group — a 44% difference 
(P<0.001). When only crises severe enough to cause hospitalization were considered, the median annual 
rates were 1.0 and 2.4, respectively (P<0.001). Moreover, the two groups did differ with respect to the 
number of patients in whom chest syndrome developed (25 in the hydroxyurea group vs 51 in the placebo 
group, P<0.001), the number of patients who received transfusions (48 vs 73, P=0.001), and the number 
of units of blood transfused (336 vs 586, P=0.004 by Van der Waerden’s test). The median time to the 
first vaso-occlusive crisis was longer in patients treated with hydroxyurea than in those given placebo 
(3.0 vs 1.5 months, P=0.01), as was the time to the second crisis (8.8 vs 4.6 months, P<0.001) (Figure 
5). There was no evidence to suggest that the effect of hydroxyurea changed during two years of 
treatment (P=0.77 for the analysis of the time to the first crisis and P=0.86 for the analysis of the time to 
the second crisis).

Figure 5: Median Time from the Initiation of Treatment to the First (Panel A) and Second (Panel B) 
Painful Crises, According to Treatment Group. Painful crises occurred later in patients receiving 
hydroxyurea than in those receiving placebo, and the effect was evident in less than six months. 
After the study ended (January 1995), examination of the doses of hydroxyurea revealed that after six 
months of treatment, only 33% of the patients in the hydroxyurea group were receiving the maximal 
tolerated dose or had been receiving a higher dose that was subsequently reduced. By the time the study 
ended, 51% of the patients treated with hydroxyurea were receiving the maximal tolerated doses, and 
doses for the remainder of patients were nearly maximal. The daily doses of hydroxyurea ranged from 0 
mg per kilogram in the 2% of patients who could not tolerate hydroxyurea to 35 mg per kilogram— the 
maximal prescribed dose — in 21% of patients. Capsule counts suggested that about 75% of the patients 
took more than 80% of their capsules. During the dose titration, blood counts consistent with a finding of 
marrow depression were observed at least once in 35% of the patients who received placebo. Hemoglobin 
levels, MCVs, fetal hemoglobin levels, and proportions of F cells were higher in the hydroxyurea group 
than in the placebo group at the time the study ended, and white-cell, platelet, reticulocyte, and 
dense-cell counts were lower. Differences between the groups in the MCV and proportion of F cells 
appeared within 8 weeks of the initiation of the study, reached a peak at about 40 weeks, and then 
declined (Figure 6).

(upper and lower limits of boxes), and the maximal and minimal values (vertical lines) are shown. 
Differences in the effect on mortality and stroke outcomes were not statistically significant. Over 2 years 
of treatment, the benefit of hydroxycarbamide on quality of life was limited to people who maintained 
increased HbF levels. These restricted benefits occurred in social function, pain recall, and general health 
perception. The trial had low risk of bias but was stopped early for benefit, which may have exaggerated 
the observed benefit. In 1998, based on the results of this trial, the FDA approved hydroxycarbamide for 
the treatment of clinically severe SCA in adults. 
A 9-year follow up analysis of MSH participants indicated a reduction in mortality for the group of people 
who took hydroxycarbamide compared to those who did not take the medication. When the cohort was 
followed for up to 9 years, people taking hydroxycarbamide had 40% reduced mortality (analysis 
according to cumulative hydroxycarbamide exposure, not the original randomization). Survival was 
related to HbF levels and frequency of vaso-occlusive crises. More recently, extension of the follow up 
analysis to 17.5 years for nonrandomized people indicated continued safety and benefit of 
hydroxycarbamide, including reduced mortality. After a follow up of 17.5 years, 43.1% of patients had 
died (n=129; 4.4 per 100-patient years). Eighty seven percent of patients who died were never exposed 
to hydroxycarbamide or took it for less than five years, suggesting that long-term use of 
hydroxycarbamide reduces mortality (Steinberg et al 2010).

Low fixed dose hydroxycarbamide in children with sickle cell disease (Jain et 
al 2012) 
This was a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study conducted in a tertiary hospital in India. 
The study was conducted in children with sickle cell anaemia (proportion with each genotype not stated) 
between the ages of 5 and 18 years with three or more blood transfusions or vaso-occlusive crises 
requiring hospitalization per year despite high HbF. The primary endpoint was the decrease in 
vaso-occlusive crises per patient per year. Secondary outcomes were a decrease in frequency of blood 
transfusions and hospitalisations and an increase in HbF levels. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
This is a double blind randomized controlled study that was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Nagpur 
City located in Central India. Permission was obtained from the institutional ethics committee and 
informed con sent was obtained from the parents of all participants. Children with severe sickle cell 
anemia ranging in age from 5 to 18 years were included in the study. The mean age of patients in the HU 
group and placebo group were 12.73 ± 4.4 and 11.73 ± 4.08, respectively. Severe sickle cell anemia was 
defined as frequent vaso-occlusive crises requiring hospitalization (>3 per year) and/or frequent blood 
transfusion requirement (>3 per year). Exclusion criteria were seropositivity for human 
immunodeficiency virus or any chronic illness that could potentially enhance HU toxicity. All patients were 
confirmed to have sickle cell anemia by hemoglobin (Hb) analysis with high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC). Eligible subjects were randomized using randomization tables to receive either 
HU or placebo therapy. The laboratory technician and the clinician who assessed these patients were not 
aware of the treatment arm.  
Treatments 
Children in the HU group received HU at a fixed dose of 10 mg/kg/day orally as a single dose for 18 
months. Patients in the placebo group received powdered glucose capsules having the same appearance 
as the HU capsules. Subjects were supplied with enough drugs for 1 month. The patients were asked to 
attend regular monthly follow-up for evaluation with detailed history and physical examination. They 
were also monitored with complete blood count and reticulocyte count at monthly intervals, with HbF, 
renal and liver function tests at 3 monthly intervals. Compliance was assessed by counting the total 
number of capsules remaining at the next follow-up visit. All patients were advised to take folic acid (5 
mg/day) and increased fluid intake a long with avoiding extreme temperatures. After completion of the 
study period all participants were unblinded and HU therapy was offered to all participants. 
Objectives 
This study was under taken to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of fixed low dose HU therapy in Indian 
sickle cell anemia patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary outcome of the study was a decrease in the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises per patient per 
year. Secondary outcomes were a decrease in frequency of blood transfusions and hospitalizations and an 
increase in HbF levels. Hematological toxicities were defined as reticulocyte count <80,000/μL with 
simultaneous Hb value <9.0 g/dL, platelet count <80,000/μL, total leucocyte count <4000/μL, 20.0% 
decrease in Hb concentration from entry or previous value or Hb concentration <5.0 g/dL. Hepatic toxicity

was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) two times above the baseline value. Renal toxicity was 
defined as serum creatinine level of> 1.0 mg/dL or a 50.0% increase from baseline. General toxicities 
including hair loss, skin and nail changes, and gastrointestinal disturbances were noted. A major adverse 
event was defined as death or any other life-threatening clinical event likely to interfere, either 
temporarily or permanently with the subject's ability to continue or tolerate HU therapy. 
Sample size 
Sixty patients (32 females and 28 males) with sickle cell anemia were enrolled for the study with 30 
patients (16 females and 14 males) in each group. 
Randomisation 
Not available. 
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was double blind. 
Statistical methods 
The study had sufficient statistical power (90.0%) to detect a mean difference in frequency of 
vaso-occlusive crises of 1.9 per patient per year with a standard deviation of 0.5, assuming an a error of 
0.05. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 16. Paired t test was used to compare the 
baseline findings with those after HU therapy, while independent t test was used to compare the HU 
treated group with the placebo treated group at baseline and at 18 months. A p value of <0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. 
Formulations 
Capsules were used, but it was not specified if they were Hydrea, Droxia, or custom-made.

This information was not available in the literature. 
Baseline data 
The HU treated group and placebo group did not differ with respect to age, gender distribution or any of 
the factors listed in Tables 17 and 18.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Hematological parameters at baseline and after 18 months of intervention in the HU and placebo groups 
are summarized in Table 17. Hemoglobin levels and HbF percentages increased significantly in the HU 
treated group compared to baseline of HU group and 18 months of placebo group. There was significant 
decrease in the reticulocyte count and serum billirubin in the HU group which suggested decreased 
hemolysis with HU therapy. White blood cell count decreased significantly in the HU treated group 
although no patients had leucopenia. There were no significant differences in red cell count, platelet 
count, serum creatinine, ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in either group.

Table 17: Comparison of the Hematological Parameters at Baseline and After 18 Months of lntervention 
of the Hydroxyurea and Placebo Groups 
Table 18 summarises the number of sickle cell anemia related clinical events reported during the study 
period. With HU therapy, event rates per patient per year for vaso-occlusive crises, blood transfusions 
and hospitalizations decreased by 95.0, 94.6 and 93.1%, respectively. When compared with the placebo 
group, patients treated with HU therapy had 94.0, 93.4 and 89.5% lesser vaso-occlusive crises, blood 
transfusions, and hospitalizations, respectively. Even among hospitalized patients, the duration of 
hospitalization was less in the HU group (3. 1 ± 1.2 days) than their counterparts in the placebo group 
(7.1 ± 2.1 days). 
Table 18: Comparison of the Number of Clinical Events Before and After Intervention in the Hydroxyurea 
and Placebo Groups 
Ferster et al 1996 
This was a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study. It was conducted in a single centre in 
Belgium and involved 25 children and young adults (age range: 2 to 22 years) with HbSS genotype and 
severe clinical manifestations (defined as >3 vaso-occlusive crises in the year before study entry and/or 
with previous history of stroke, acute chest pain, recurrent crises without a free interval, or splenic 
sequestration) with the primary end-point of number of hospitalizations and number of days in hospital. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Twenty-five children and young adults severely affected by SCA were selected to receive HU. They all 
originate from Central African countries (24 from Zaire and 1 from Cameroun). There were 13 girls and 12 
boys. Ages ranged from 2 to 22 years, with a median of 9 years. These 25 patients were initially selected 
for the study on the basis of severe clinical disease. To be eligible for the study, the patients had to have 
homozygous SCA. Patients with sickle cell β-thalassemia were excluded, but patients with α-gene deletion 
were included. To enter the study, patients had to have reported more than 3 vaso-occlusive crises in the 
year before entry into the study and/or have a previous history of stroke, acute chest syndrome,

recurrent crises without free interval, or splenic sequestration. Transfusion therapy is clearly 
recommended in preventing recurrent stroke. Because many of our SCA patients develop 
alloimmunization, this therapy may become ineffective in them. For this reason, patients with a previous 
history of stroke were also eligible for the trial, but only if appropriate transfusion therapy could not be 
conducted (severe alloimmunization in 1 patient and refusal in another). The study was approved by both 
hospital ethics committees and oral informed consent was obtained from the patient and/or the parents 
or tutors. Patients and/or parents or tutors were made aware of the potential risk of teratogenesis and 
mutagenesis associated with chronic exposure to HU. Teenage and adult patients were counselled 
regarding contraception and pregnancy. The characteristics of the 25 patients are presented in Table19. 
Table 19: Characteristics of the 25 patients in the Ferster et al 1996 study 
Treatments 
HU was administered at an initial dosage of 20 mg/kg every day. If no change in HbF level had occurred 
after 2 months (increase <2%), the doses of HU were increased up to 25 mg/kg/d. In case of bone 
marrow toxicity defined by a white blood cell count (WBC) less than 3×109/L and/or a platelet count less 
than 80×109/L, the initial dosage was reduced by 50%. All patients received 1 mg of folic acid each day. 
Children under 6 years of age received oral penicillin in addition. All patients were seen monthly in the 
outpatient clinic. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The end points of interest in this study were the number of hospitalizations and the number of days in 
hospital. The number of days of pain was also initially considered as an endpoint of the trial. Patients or 
their parents were asked to fill out a card to report their painful episodes. However, during the course of 
the trial, it became clear that this information could not be reliably obtained from a majority of the 
patients, and this endpoint was dropped from all analyses.

Randomisation

Blinding (masking) 
By drawing consecutive sealed envelopes, patients were randomly allocated to one of the following 
treatment sequences: either HU first for a period of 6 months, followed by placebo for 6 months, or 
placebo first, followed by HU for an additional 6 months. The study was run single-blind (the patient was 
unaware of the treatment received, but the physician had knowledge of the treatment). The drug or the 
placebo was provided monthly for each patient by the hospital pharmacy. Both were indistinguishable. 
The trial was run single-blind rather than double-blind because of the logistic difficulty of blinding the 
attending physician to the treatment received. Indeed, for the blinding to be effective, the attending 
physician should have been denied access to the pharmacy records and to the laboratory results in the 
hospital database. 
Statistical methods 
The paired Student's t-test was used to determine the level of significance of differences between biologic 
parameters before and after HU treatment. Correlations were computed using the Pearson's correlation 
test. The standard analysis of the 2-treatment 2-period cross-over trial was adopted. The Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test was used to assess the significance of the effects of treatment, period, and carry-over. 
Two-tailed P values less than .05 were considered to be statistically significant. 
Formulations 
No specific details are given on the formulation used.

Numbers analysed 
Twenty-five patients entered the study. Twenty-four patients fulfilled the initial inclusion criteria. One 
patient was included although he experienced only 2 vaso-occlusive crises during the 12 months 
preceding the study. Three patients were excluded after 4 to 5 months because they failed to attend the 
monthly evaluation visits. Because these patients could not be evaluated at the end of their first time 
period and during their second time period, they could not contribute to the treatment comparisons and 
were therefore excluded from all analyses. There were thus 22 patients who could be analysed (median 
age, 8 years).

Outcomes and estimation 
The mean initial hemoglobin level was 8.1 g/dL (range, 6.7 to 9.3 g/dL). After 6 months of HU treatment, 
the mean hemoglobin level increased to 8.5 g/dL (range, 7 .2 to 10 g/dL). An increase of more than 1 g/dL 
was observed in 9 of 22 evaluable patients (Table 20). The difference was not significant (P = .068). 
The mean initial mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 85.2 fL (range, 63 to 98.3 fL). After 6 months of HU 
therapy, it increased to 95.5 fL (range, 68 to 112 fL). This change was highly significant (P < .001; Table 
20). The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) did not change significantly (P = .069). The 
mean initial HbF value was 4.7% (range, 0.1% to 20.2%). After 6 months of HU therapy, it increased up 
to 15% (range, 1.1 % to 38%). This difference was highly significant (P < .001). A threefold increase of 
the initial HbF value was observed in 11 patients; a twofold increase was observed in 7 patients. The 
increase of HbF correlated significantly with the increase of MCV. In some patients, the MCV increased 
weeks before any increase in the HbF level. 
After 6 months of HU treatment, the reticulocyte count significantly decreased from 149% ±: 54% to 
103% ±: 49% (P < 0.001). The absolute neutrophil count remained within the normal range in all 
patients; however, it decreased significantly in patients treated with HU (Table 20). Only 2 children 
developed transient mild thrombocytopenia between 100×109/L and 140×109/L, which did not require a 
reduction of the initial HU doses. Five patients reached the final dose of 25 mg/kg/d. No other biologic side 
effect was observed. No patient required a dose reduction for thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. 
Table 20: Mean hematologic values before and after 6 Months of treatment with HU 
No correlation was found between HbF increase and the initial HbF level, WBC count, or platelet count. In 
addition to the significant changes in the MCV and HbF level, most patients responded favorably clinically. 
In 16 patients, a complete disappearance of vaso-occlusive events requiring hospitalisation occurred 
within the first month of HU treatment. Among these 16 patients, 3 were severely disabled: 1 with a 
previous history of recurrent strokes, 1 with severe chronic bone pain, and 1 with 208 days in hospital 
during the year preceding entry into the trial. 
No relevant change in the number of crises requiring hospitalization occurred in 6 patients. Of interest, in 
these 6 patients, the HbF level only slightly increased from 1.7% (range, 0.1% to 4.7%) to 3.2% (range, 
1.1% to 7%). Three of them required a dose increase up to 25 mg/kg according to the initial protocol, 
whereas only 2 of the 16 responders needed a dose increase. Two of the three patients who were 
excluded from analysis remained highly symptomatic (recurrent acute chest syndrome [ACS] or/and high 
hospitalization rate for crises). The third patient, who had a history of previous stroke, died 2.5 years after 
inclusion from suspected intracranial haemorrhage. 
Overall, the number of hospitalisations was reduced when patients were on HU therapy as compared with 
placebo. The statistical tests (Table 21) indicated a very significant effect of treatment and no significant 
period effect or carry-over effect from the first to the second 6-month period. Combining the results of

both periods, 16 patients of 22 (73%) did not require any hospitalization for painful episodes when 
treated with HU as compared with only 3 of 22 (14%) when treated with placebo. 
The number of days in hospital was also significantly lower when patients were on HU therapy (range, 0 
to 19 days) than when they were on placebo (range, 0 to 104 days). During the first 6-month period, the 
mean number of days in hospital was 5.3 days for HU, as compared with 15.2 days for placebo; during the 
second 6-month period, these figures were, respectively, 1.8 days for HU and 8.2 days for placebo. The 
treatment difference was statistically significant, but the downward trend from the first to the second 
period was not (Table 21). 
No pregnancies occurred in the female patients.

TWiTCH Study (Ware et al 2015) 
Ηydroxycarbamide was shown to be inferior to transfusion in the Stroke with Transfusions Changing to 
Hydroxycarbamide (SWiTCH) trial based on a composite end point (Ware et al 2012). More recently 
though, the TCD with Transfusions Changing to Hydroxycarbamide (TWiTCH) clinical trial was terminated 
early in agreement with the recommendations of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). TWiTCH 
(NCT01425307) was a NHLBI-funded Phase III multicentre randomized clinical trial comparing 
24-months of standard treatment (transfusions) to alternative treatment (hydroxycarbamide) in children 
with SCA and abnormal TCD velocities. All eligible children had received at least 12 months of transfusions 
and did not have severe vasculopathy. TWiTCH had a non-inferiority trial design; the primary study 
endpoint was the 24-month TCD velocity obtained from a linear mixed model, controlling for baseline 
(enrolment) values, with a non-inferiority margin of 15 cm/s.  
Methods 
Study Participants 
Patients from 26 paediatric hospitals and health centres in the USA and Canada who were aged 4–16 
years and had sickle cell anaemia and abnormal TCD velocities (≥200 cm/s) were eligible to participate if 
they had received at least 12 months of chronic transfusions. Local investigators had discretion with 
respect to enrolment within their institution. All patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
eligible. Documented clinical stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or severe vasculopathy were exclusion 
criteria. After local Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent had been obtained 
from patients’ parents or guardians (with patient assent where required by local Institutional Review 
Boards), eligible participants were screened for original abnormal TCD verification and baseline brain 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography, TCD examination with non-imaging instruments 
that were identical at every centre (SonaraTek, Middleton, WI, USA), liver iron concentration (LIC) 
assessed by FerriScan R2-MRI (Resonance Health, Claremont, WA, Australia), abdominal 
ultra-sonography and MRI, neurocognitive testing, and quality of life assessments. Participants with 
baseline grade 4 or higher severe brain MRA vasculopathy, defined as moderate stenosis in more than two 
arterial segments or severe stenosis or occlusion in at least one segment, or with inadequate TCD

velocities from poor blood flow or bone windows were deemed screening failures and removed from the 
study. Children with normal, conditional, or persistent abnormal screening TCD velocities while receiving 
chronic transfusions remained eligible for randomisation. 
Between Sept 20, 2011, and April 17, 2013, 159 patients consented and enrolled in TWiTCH, including 38 
who were ineligible for treatment: 19 had severe vasculopathy, ten withdrew from the study, seven failed 
screening TCD, three failed original TCD verification, and one had an inadequate brain MRA (two 
participants failed for two reasons). Therefore, 121 participants were randomly assigned to treatment, 
forming the intention-to treat population. 61 patients were assigned to receive standard transfusions and 
60 patients were assigned to hydroxycarbamide treatment. 
Treatments 
Participants assigned to receive standard treatment continued to receive transfusions once per month to 
maintain HbS at 30% or lower, with local discretion with respect to transfusion type (simple, partial 
exchange, or erythrocytapheresis). For these children, deferasirox was recommended to manage iron 
overload; children already receiving chelation therapy maintained their current dose, whereas those 
starting chelation therapy received deferasirox tablets at 10–40 mg/kg per day, with the dose dependent 
on LIC at screening. Participants assigned to receive oral hydroxycarbamide initiated treatment at 20 
mg/kg per day (capsules or liquid formulation) with escalation to maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which 
we defined as the dose at which moderate marrow suppression of neutrophils and reticulocytes was 
achieved, as previously reported. Transfusions were slowly weaned in accordance with a standard 
protocol over 4–9 months to protect against stroke during hydroxycarbamide dose escalation. After MTD 
had been established and transfusions were discontinued, patients receiving hydroxycarbamide 
underwent serial phlebotomy to manage iron overload. Every 4 weeks until the end of the 24 month 
treatment period, 10 mL/kg (maximum 500 mL) venous blood was removed during 30–60 min in 
accordance with a standardised protocol. Smaller phlebotomy volumes (5 mL/kg) were removed if 
patients had haemoglobin concentrations of 80–85 g/L, and phlebotomy was not done if haemoglobin 
concentration was less than 80 g/L. The treatment period was 24 months after randomisation, with a 6 
month visit after completing exit studies. 
TCD velocities were measured every 4 weeks in triplicate during screening, at 12 week intervals during 
the 24 month treatment period, and again in triplicate at the end of the 24 month treatment period. TCD 
examinations were done just before transfusions or phlebotomy, and all were read centrally by observers 
masked to treatment assignment and previous TCD results. Additional assessments included brain MRI 
and MRA at study entry and exit; liver MRI for iron burden at study entry, midpoint, and exit; 
neurocognitive testing at study entry and exit; and quality of life at study entry, midpoint, and exit.  
All new potential stroke events were assessed with careful neurological evaluation and brain MRI/MRA 
examinations, then adjudicated centrally by a panel of expert reviewers. Independent and then 
consensus opinions were obtained from neurologists and neuroradiologists masked to study treatment. 
Participants with possible or likely stroke based on new neurological signs or symptoms, but without 
corresponding radio logical changes, were scored as transient ischaemic attack. Brain MRI/MRA 
examinations at study exit allowed us to confirm that no strokes had been missed by the adjudication 
process.  
Protocol-defined rescue transfusions were given to participants in either treatment group if they were 
identified as having perceived increased stroke risk: reasons included failure to suppress HbS percentage 
in the standard group, and excessive toxic effects or failure to achieve marrow suppression targets in the 
alternative group. A protocol-defined alert algorithm was used to identify participants whose TCD 
velocities varied substantially from baseline and might confer increased stroke risk, and these children 
received additional assessments and closer therapeutic monitoring during the course of the study.

Objectives 
TWiTCH was a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial, in which we compared alternative 
treatment (hydroxycarbamide) with standard treatment (transfusions) for the maintenance of TCD 
velocities as a surrogate for stroke risk. TCD velocities were chose for investigation on the basis of 
evidence showing that high velocities confer an increased stroke risk. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary study endpoint was the maximum TCD time-averaged mean velocity on the index side, which 
was defined as the cerebral hemisphere with the higher mean arterial velocity at baseline assessment. 
Secondary endpoints were TCD velocity on the non-index side, new stroke or non-stroke neurological 
events, new brain MRI/MRA lesions, hepatic iron overload, sickle-related events, neuropsychological 
status, quality of life, growth, and treatment-related complications. Secondary endpoints such as 
neurocognitive status, quality of life, and growth and development will be addressed in future 
manuscripts. AEs were assessed in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0 and analysed according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version 18.0. 
Blinding (masking) 
Treatment was open-label, but the principal investigator was masked to all treatment-related results, and 
local investigators were masked to TCD results. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was the 24 month TCD velocity, which was calculated from a general linear mixed 
model using all TCD velocities captured throughout the trial. This endpoint was calculated based on the 
intention-to-treat population, with two planned interim analyses after 33% and 67% of participants had 
completed exit studies. The stopping guidelines for non-inferiority used the Lan-DeMets version of the 
O’Brien-Fleming group sequential method. A one-sided non-inferiority margin of 15 cm/s was used in the 
analysis, which represents the biological variation of TCD examinations. It was estimated that a sample 
size of 148 children would be needed, assuming that 20% dropped out during screening, yielding 118 
participants assigned to treatment. Assuming another 15% dropped out after treatment allocation, 100 
participants (50 per group) would complete the 24 month treatment period. This study design provided at 
least 90% power to test the non-inferiority hypothesis, assuming a difference of 5 cm/s (alternative 
higher than standard) and a standard deviation of 24 cm/s. Comparisons of continuous variables with t 
tests and comparisons of categorical variables with χ² analyses were done. Analyses in the 
intention-to-treat population were performed, except for a planned per-protocol analysis of TCD 
velocities, which excluded participants who exited the study early. Also, a sensitivity analysis that 
adjusted for baseline age was done. All analyses were performed with Stata 14.0 or SAS 9.4. 
Formulations 
Capsules (Droxia and Hydrea) or liquid formulation (20 mg/kg per day). 
Recruitment 
Between Sept 20, 2011, and April 17, 2013, 121 participants were randomly assigned to treatment. The 
Ware et al paper does not provide the date of the follow-up period, but mentions that it lasted 6 months.

Baseline data 
Most baseline demo graphic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were similar between treatment 
groups, except for higher white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts and higher bilirubin 
concentrations in the alternative group (Table 22). Despite the exclusion criterion of clinically overt 
stroke, more than a third of the participants in both treatment groups had evidence of previous silent 
cerebral infarctions.

Numbers analysed 
121 participants were randomly assigned to treatment, forming the intention to treat population. 61 
patients were assigned to receive standard transfusions and 60 patients were assigned to 
hydroxycarbamide treatment.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Participants assigned to standard treatment mainly received simple transfusions (57% of procedures), 
with some partial exchange transfusions (31% of procedures), or automated erythrocytapheresis (12% 
of procedures). In patients receiving standard transfusions, haemoglobin concentration remained steady 
at about 90 g/L with average HbS remaining less than 30% throughout the study treatment period 
(Figure 7). Chelation was provided to children receiving transfusions who had hepatic iron overload, 
usually deferasirox starting at an average dose of 25.7 mg/kg per day (SD 6.0). In the alternative group, 
all 60 participants started at 20 mg/kg per day followed by dose escalation. MTD was reached in 57 (95%)

of 60 children, who then discontinued transfusions as per protocol; two patients did not reach MTD 
because of medication non-adherence leading to study withdrawal and one patient had an early 
adjudicated transient ischaemic attack during the overlap period while on both hydroxycarbamide and 
transfusions. The median time to MTD was 27 weeks (IQR 24–32); medianhydroxycarbamide MTD was 
27.4 mg/kg/day (IQR 24.0–30.1). In children receiving hydroxycarbamide, haemoglobin concentrations 
remained stable at about 90 g/L, and we saw the expected substantial haematological changes in MCV, 
percentage of HbF, white blood cell count, neutrophils, platelets, and reticulocytes. Marrow suppression 
targets were achieved, with median absolute neutrophil count at MTD of 3.4×10
 cells per L (IQR 2.4–4.1) 
and final average neutrophil count of 3.6×10
 cells per L (Table 23). HbF responses included a median 
⁹
MTD value of 26.2% (IQR 22.4–31.2) and final average HbF of 24.4%.

Baseline TCD velocities were similar in the two treatment groups, but the final average velocity of the 
alternative group was slightly lower than that of the standard group (Figure 8). After full enrolment and 
when 37% of the participants had exited the study, the first scheduled interim analysis showed that the 
stopping boundary had been passed and non-inferiority was shown. After 50% of participants had exited, 
repeat analyses supported these findings and the study was terminated by NHLBI. Remaining participants 
then completed all exit studies before discontinuing protocol-directed study treatment. In total, the 
standard group included 42 participants who completed study treatment, 11 who had truncated 
treatment, and eight who exited early; the alternative group included 41 participants who completed 
treatment, 13 who had truncated treatment, and six who exited early. The final model-based TCD velocity 
in participants who received transfusions was 143 cm/s (95% CI 140–146), whereas this was 138 cm/s 
(135–142) in those who received hydroxycarbamide, with a difference of 4·54 (0.10–8.98). 
Non-inferiority (p=8.82 × 10–¹
analysis that excluded study participants who exited the study early showed almost identical findings, 
with a difference of 5·06 (0.56–9.57), non-inferiority p value of 1.05 × 10-15, and a post-hoc superiority 
p value of 0.015. An age adjusted sensitivity analysis gave almost identical findings (not shown). TCD 
) and post-hoc superiority (p=0.023) were met. The planned per-protocol 
⁶
velocities for all participants were mostly in the normal range at both study entry and exit (Figure 8). No 
child in either treatment group reverted from normal to abnormal TCD velocities. Table 23 includes 
additional laboratory values at study exit.

A painful crisis was defined as a visit to a 
medical facility that lasted more than four hours 
for acute sickling-related pain, which was 
treated with a parenterally administered 
narcotic.  
The occurrence of chest syndrome (chest-wall 
pain in association with findings of a new 
pulmonary infiltrate on chest x-ray films and 
fever) was considered a crisis.

Although no secondary endpoints are provided in the Charache et al paper, time to the first and second 
vaso-occlusive crisis, number of patients in whom chest syndrome developed, number of patients who 
received transfusions, and number of units of blood transfused appear on the Results section of the paper. 
The first two are considered as primary endpoints by the assessor. Elongation of the time between the 
first and second crisis can be considered as a description of reduced frequency. ACS is considered in the 
paper to be a crisis. Therefore, these two results were added to Table 24. The other two parameters are 
not added, since they are not connected with the primary endpoint nor are they secondary endpoints.

the dose at which moderate marrow 
suppression of neutrophils and reticulocytes 
was achieved, as previously reported. 
Transfusions were slowly weaned in 
accordance with a standard protocol over 4–
9 months to protect against stroke during 
hydroxycarbamide dose escalation. After 
MTD had been established and transfusions 
were discontinued, patients receiving 
hydroxycarbamide underwent serial 
phlebotomy to manage iron overload.

Extrapolation of Efficacy Data in the Main studies to other SCD genotypes  
The vast majority of the supporting efficacy data is derived from patients with the HbSS and HbSβº 
genotypes (two of the most common genotypes). However, a number of recent observational studies 
have reported data that provide important supporting evidence for the benefits of hydroxycarbamide in 
other SCD genotypes. 
Italia et al (2009) investigated the efficacy and safety of hydroxycarbamide in an Indian population with 
severe manifestations where the Sβ gene is linked to the Arab–Indian haplotype and where the 
phenotype is associated with higher HbF levels. Seventy-seven patients (29 adult sickle homozygous, 25 
paediatric sickle homozygous, 23 adult sickle β-thalassaemia) were recruited: most of the sickle (Sβ) 
chromosomes (104/108) of group I and II were linked to the Arab–Indian haplotype, while 4 βs 
chromosomes were linked to atypical haplotypes. The Sβ chromosomes among the group III patients 
were linked to the Arab–Indian haplotype in all except 1, which showed another haplotype. Patients with 
the Arab–Indian haplotype showed a mean increase in HbF of 39% and mean decrease in clinical score of 
44% while patients with atypical haplotypes showed a mean increase in HbF of 52% and mean decrease 
in clinical score by 42%. 
Voskaridou et al (2010) reported a prospective clinical study of hydroxycarbamide therapy in Greek 
patients with a 17-year follow up analysis (Laikon Study of Hydroxycarbamide in Sickle Cell Syndromes 
LaSHS trial, Voskaridou et al 2010). A total of 330 patients (136 men/194 women; median age, 42 years; 
range, 20-76 years), were enrolled. Thirty four patients had HbSS, and 296 were compound 
heterozygotes for HbS and -thalassaemia: 131 patients with HbSβ0-thalassaemia and 165 patients with 
HbSβ+-thalassaemia. This prospective trial showed a dramatic reduction (> 95%) in the median annual 
rate of painful crisis and not differentiated by genotype. These results are comparable with those of the 
Multicentre Study of Hydroxycarbamide (MSH) study, in which the administration of hydroxycarbamide 
was given for a much shorter median period (< 24 months). The significant reduction of the painful crises, 
the incidence of transfusion requirements, the hospital admissions, and the incidence of chest syndrome 
that were observed in this study supports the notion that hydroxycarbamide is of benefit for all SCD 
patients and use should be extended to SCD syndromes. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 
overall survival probabilities. The probability of 10-year survival was 86% for hydroxycarbamide patients, 
whereas it was only 65% for patients who were conventionally treated. The study also confirmed that the 
beneficial effect of hydroxycarbamide on survival was mainly in HbSS and HbSβ0-thal patients, whereas 
this effect on HbSβ+-thal was present but statistically insignificant. 
Rigano et al (2017) conducted a nation-wide cohort study of SCD in Italy, evaluating the impact of 
hydroxycarbamide on a total of 652 paediatric and adult patients from 33 Reference Centres for SCD 
(mean age 24.5 ± 15 years, 51.4% males). Hydroxycarbamide median treatment duration was 7 years 
(range:< 1 year to 29 years) at a mean therapeutic dose of 18 ± 4.7 mg/kg/day. The analysis compared

endpoints pre- and on-hydroxycarbamide. Hydroxycarbamide treatment was associated with a significant 
increase in mean total and HbF and a significant decrease in mean HbS, WBC and platelet count and LDH 
levels. Hydroxycarbamide was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of ACS (−29.3%, p 
< 0.001), vaso-occlusive crisis (−34.1%, p < 0.001), hospitalization (−53.2%, p < 0.001), and bone 
necrosis (−6.9%, p < 0.001). New silent cerebral infarction (SCI) occurred during treatment (+42.4%, p 
< 0.001) but not stroke (+0.5%, p =0.572). These observations were generally consistent upon 
stratification for age, descent (Caucasian or African), genotype (HbSS, HbSβ0 or HbSβ+) and duration of 
treatment (< or ≥10 years). There were no new safety concerns observed compared to those commonly 
reported in the literature. 
Lê et al (2015) recently reported the survival of patients with SCD in Belgium and the effects of 
disease-modifying therapies. These investigators took advantage of a national registry, created in 2008, 
that includes patients of 8 centres. Data from between 2008 and 2012 provide over 5,000 patient-years 
(PY) of observation from 469 children and adults with SCD. Four hundred and twenty three of these 
patients had the HbSS, HbSβ0 genotype, 36 patients had the HbSC genotype and 7 patients had the 
HbSβ+ genotype. Data were registered from neonatal screening or from diagnosis (first contact) until last 
follow-up or death. Data included diagnosis, demography, and outcome data. The global mortality rate 
was low (0.25/100 PY), although 13 patients died (2.8%) and was similar between children, adolescents 
(10–18 years), and young adults (P=0.76). Out of the cohort, 185 patients received hydroxycarbamide at 
last follow-up (median duration of treatment: 10.3 years), 90 underwent HSCT, 24 were chronically 
transfused, and 170 had never had any disease modifying therapy (DMT). Hydroxycarbamide showed 
significant benefit on patients’ outcomes as reflected by a lower mortality rate compared to transplanted 
individuals or people without DMT (0.14, 0.36, and 0.38 per 100 PY, respectively) and by higher Kaplan–
Meier estimates of 15 year survival (99.4%) compared to HSCT (93.8%; P=0.01) or no DMT groups 
(95.4%; P=0.04). In summary, SCD mortality in Belgium was low with no increase observed in young 
adults. However, patients treated with hydroxycarbamide demonstrate a significant benefit in survival 
when compared to those without DMT or transplanted. There were no deaths in HbSC or HbSβ+ group. 
Lebensburger et al (2015) conducted a retrospective review of 30 patients with HbSC (n=23) and SB+ 
thalassaemia (n=7), who had matched data for pre- and post-hydroxycarbamide hospitalization. The 
mean age for starting hydroxycarbamide in this cohort was 9.4±4.5 years without a difference in starting 
age by genotype (9.2 years in HbSC vs 9.9 in HbSβ+ thalassaemia). There was a significant reduction in 
hospitalizations on hydroxycarbamide over 2 years as compared to the 2 years prior to hydroxycarbamide 
initiation (mean total hospitalizations/year prehydroxycarbamide and post-hydroxycarbamide: 1.6 vs 
0.4, respectively, P<0.001; also mean pain hospitalizations/year pre-hydroxycarbamide and 
post-hydroxycarbamide: 1.5 vs 0.3, respectively, P<0.001). Patients demonstrated haematologic 
changes including an increase in HbF (%) pre– and post-hydroxycarbamide (4.5% to 7.7%, P=0.002), 
MCV (74 to 86 fL, P<0.0001), and decrease in ANC (5.0 to 3.2×109/L, P=0.007). Patients with higher 
doses of hydroxycarbamide demonstrated the greatest reduction in hospitalizations but this was 
unrelated to ANC. No differences were noted after 1 year in Hb, absolute reticulocyte count, LDH, 
bilirubin, or AST. 
Yates et al (2013) report the long term response to hydroxycarbamide in children with clinically severe 
HbSC. Fifteen patients (nine female, six male) were treated with hydroxycarbamide. Patients were 
followed for a median of 6 years (range: 3.1–13.2) prior to initiation of hydroxycarbamide. The median 
age at hydroxycarbamide initiation was 9.6 years (range: 3.8–14.9). Treatment was indicated because of 
frequent pain episodes (n =8), recurrent ACS (n = 1), or both pain and ACS (n = 6). Most patients started 
hydroxycarbamide at a dose of 15–20 mg/kg/day, but four were started on a lower dose. Dose initiation 
and adjustment were determined by individual providers, but most patients had dose escalation similar to 
HbSS patients. The median follow-up on treatment was 4.8 years (range: 1.5–7.0) with a total follow-up 
of 72 patient years. The median maximum dose of hydroxycarbamide was 24 mg/kg/day (range: 15.6–

29.9). After initiation of hydroxycarbamide therapy, the median decrease in ACS was 0.23 events per 
year (P = 0.0004); pain crises were reduced by a median of 0.91 events per year (P = 0.01). The median 
increase in MCV and HbF were 16.2 fl (P = 0.0001) and 5.1% (P = 0.0001), respectively. There were 
significant decreases in the median platelet count (82.4×109/L, P =0.003), WBC (2.1×109/L, P = 
0.0001), ANC (1800/mm3, P = 0.01), and ARC (40×109/L, P = 0.008). Additionally, there were increases 
in creatinine (0.07 mg/dl, P = 0.04) and bilirubin (0.18 mg/dl, P = 0.008) and a decrease in aspartate 
aminotransferase (4.3 U/L, P= 0.007). There were no significant changes in Hb, mean corpuscular Hb 
concentration, ALT and LDH. Five patients experienced thrombocytopenia, not associated with palpable 
splenomegaly. Hydroxycarbamide was discontinued in one patient after 3.6 years because of recurrent 
thrombocytopenia (nadir 33×109/L) even after multiple dose reductions to a final level of 10 mg/kg/day. 
One patient with splenomegaly (spleen 6 cm below costal margin) at onset of treatment experienced an 
acute splenic sequestration crisis (drop in Hb from 9.6 to 6.9 g/dl) after 19 months of therapy; this patient 
subsequently underwent splenectomy. Four patients had transient neutropenia that was not complicated 
by serious infection and resolved after temporary suspension or dose reduction of hydroxycarbamide. No 
hepatic or renal toxicity was noted. 
Luchtman-Jones et al (2016) report on a large cohort of 133 adult and paediatric HbSC patients from 23 
sites across the USA. Data were collected retrospectively: in addition to laboratory data, the number of 
vaso-occlusive pain events at baseline, and then after 6 and 12 months of hydroxycarbamide therapy was 
collected. The severity of pain was categorised on the basis of whether the patient was managed at home, 
sought treatment in the clinic or the emergency department (ED), or required hospital admission. The 
median age at initiation of treatment (estimated as the interval between birth year and year of treatment 
initiation) was 15 years, with a range of <1 to 33 years. Over half of the patients were teenagers between 
11 and 18 years of age; 15 patients were adults when hydroxycarbamide was initiated. Pain or 
vaso-occlusive crisis was the most common reason for initiation of hydroxycarbamide treatment, 
accounting for 119 (89%) patients. Acute chest syndrome was the next most common clinical indication, 
reported in 30 patients (23%), usually in conjunction with recurrent vaso-occlusive pain (22 of 30 
patients). Rarely, other reasons for starting hydroxycarbamide were given, such as priapism (3) and 
stroke (1). The mean starting dose of hydroxycarbamide for the entire cohort was 17.866.3 mg/kg/day, 
with a median value of 19.8 mg/kg/day. After 6 and 12 months of treatment, the median 
hydroxycarbamide dose remained stable at 19.9 mg/kg/day and 20.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. However, 
at the 12-month time point, the actual dose was broadly distributed: 20% were taking low-dose (<15.0 
mg/kg/day), 27% were prescribed 15.0–19.9 mg/kg/day, 33% received 20.0–24.9 mg/kg/day, and 20% 
received >25.0 mg/kg/day. 
Compared to the 12 months before hydroxycarbamide treatment, pain visits (to the clinic or emergency 
department (ED)) dropped by 35% (P<0.0002) for the entire cohort, while hospitalizations for pain 
management were reduced by 47% (P<0.0001). Pain events that were treated in the clinic, ED, or 
hospital setting combined were reduced by 38% (P<0.0001).  
Compared to baseline, the Hb concentration remained relatively stable (P<0.0001), while the HbF was 
mildly increased, <3% (P<0.0001), MCV was higher (P<0.0001), and the ANC (P=0.002) and ARC 
(P=0.03) were lower after 6 and 12 months of treatment. All of these changes in haematologic 
parameters were statistically significant for the entire cohort and were not strongly influenced by gender, 
age, or hydroxycarbamide dose. However, greater marrow suppression was noted at higher doses. 
The most common toxicities were cytopenias: isolated neutropenia (13 patients, 11%), isolated 
thrombocytopenia (7 patients, 5%), and combined neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (4 patients, 3%). 
Additional toxicities included low ARC (1), elevated hepatic transaminase in conjunction with an illness 
(1), and high haemoglobin concentration associated with increased pain (1).

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
There are 4 main studies in this application: MSH, Jain et al 2012, Ferster et al 1996, and TWiTCH. They 
justify the proposed indication, since the first three studies justify the prevention of recurrent painful 
vaso-occlusive crises including acute chest syndrome in adults, adolescents and children older than 2 
years suffering from Sickle Cell Disease and the TWiTCH study intends to support the replacement of 
regular blood transfusions for primary stroke prevention (also of vaso-occlusive nature) in children over 
the age of 2 years with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocities. The supportive studies submitted 
strengthen the results of the main studies and in the case of the first indication play the role of 
extrapolating the indication to SCD patients and not only SCA. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories may be used to replace regular blood transfusions for primary 
stroke prevention in children over the age of 2 years with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocities (time 
averaged maximum mean velocity, TAMMV > 200 cm/s), provided they have received at least 1 year of 
regular blood transfusions, their transcranial Doppler velocities have normalised (TAMMV < 170 cm/s), 
and they have no magnetic resonance imaging / angiography defined severe vasculopathy. Blood 
transfusions should continue until the maximum tolerated dose of Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories 
has been achieved. Monitor transcranial Doppler velocities every 3 months and reinstate blood 
transfusions immediately in the event of reversion back to abnormal transcranial Doppler velocities.  
The applicant justified the two proposed indications as follows: 
a) Justification for prevention of complications of SCD, including recurrent painful VOC and ACS 
According to the applicant, large volume of data on the efficacy and safety of oral hydroxycarbamide in 
reducing the complications of SCD in the adult and paediatric population is compelling. The MSH study 
was a landmark study and made hydroxycarbamide the first drug of proven benefit in the prevention of 
major problems caused by sickle cell disease: vaso-occlusive pain crisis and acute chest syndrome 
(Charache et al, 1995). Importantly, no significant adverse effects were noted and long-term effects 
monitored in the MSH follow-up study confirmed that the drug was safe and may decrease mortality 
(Steinberg et al 2010). The findings from the MSH study in adults have been replicated in children with 
SCD through a couple of smaller randomised trials (Jain et al 2012, Ferster et al 1996). In addition, a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial in infants of mean age 13.6 months (range 
9-18 months), treated for between 18-24 months, meaning that in all participants, a large proportion of 
treatment phase continued when the child was > 2 years, provides valuable supporting data for the 
proposed indication. The study showed that oral hydroxycarbamide reduced pain crises and acute chest 
syndrome and this effect was maintained throughout the 24 months of study (Wang et al 2011). 
According to the applicant, a number of large, prospective and retrospective, observational and real-life 
studies support the laboratory and clinical findings of the adult and paediatric randomised, controlled 
studies and provide important longer term safety data, including in non-SCA genotypes, and which 
provide reassurance to patients and prescribers of the benefits of oral hydroxycarbamide as a long term 
disease modifying therapy in the management of SCD. Oral hydroxycarbamide has been for many years 
been incorporated into adult and paediatric clinical practice for the treatment of symptomatic sickle cell 
disease sufferers with recurrent acute pain crises associated with VOC and hospitalization due to acute 
chest syndrome. Indeed, the use of oral hydroxycarbamide to prevent recurrent VOC and acute chest 
syndrome has been included into national guidelines such as the ‘Evidence Based Management of Sickle 
Cell-Disease: Expert Panel Report IUS National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 2014) and more recently 
Guidelines for the use of hydroxycarbamide in children and adults with sickle cell disease: A British 
Assessment report

Society for Haematology Guideline (Qureshi et al 2018). The Applicant has identified Hydrea as the 
formulation used wholly or partially in 13 clinical studies of efficacy and 9 studies contributing to the 
safety and tolerability profile submitted in the Clinical Overview. Alternative branded tablet and capsule 
formulations, as well as compounded capsules and oral solutions have also been ascertained for a number 
of studies. The data generated from dissolution studies show that, regardless of the formulation, 
hydroxycarbamide is very rapidly dissolving. No significant differences were observed between the in 
vitro dissolution profiles of tablet and capsule formulations of different brands or compounded 
preparations. The excipients included in the composition of the formulations are established and no 
interaction or influence on the pharmacokinetics of the active substance is expected. In conclusion, 
hydroxycarbamide is not only highly soluble, but also rapidly dissolving in tablet and capsule form. This 
suggests that non-Hydrea oral formulations would be expected to be bioequivalent to Hydrea in vivo, and 
as such clinical efficacy and safety data based on these alternative formulations is bridgeable to Hydrea. 
The applicant argued that hydroxycarbamide is a highly soluble and highly permeable compound, as in 
vitro solubility study and in vivo literature absorption data show. Therefore, all formulations are 
bioequivalent and data from non-Hydrea literature may be used. However, this argument can’t be 
extended to all formulations without proper bridging. The applicant was able to identify for most of the 
submitted studies the exact formulations that were used i.e. Hydrea capsules, Droxia capsules, Siklos 
tablets, and gelatin capsules filled with hydroxycarbamide drug substance. For cases where capsules 
were prepared in hospital pharmacies, the applicant’s approach was mimicking the formulation by adding 
hydroxycarbamide to gelatin 0 capsules. This approach is considered acceptable, since no extra 
excipients are expected to have been added in hospital pharmacies. Then, the applicant performed 
dissolution tests in pH 1.3, 4.5, and 6.8 with all solid formulations used in the submitted studies, which 
showed that hydroxycarbamide dissolution is rapid (>85% in 15 min) for all formulations. The excipients 
of each formulation were described and discussed, concluding that they are not considered to affect 
bioavailability. As it was shown that hydroxycarbamide is a highly soluble and highly permeable drug, the 
discussed quality attributes of non-Hydrea formulations (dissolution tests and excipient description) 
mean that bridging can be done and non-Hydrea literature can be used to justify product’s 
efficacy/safety. As a result, the first proposed indication could be justified. 
b) Justification for primary stroke prevention in children > 2 years 
Adams et al (1992) showed that transcranial ultrasonography could be used to predict stroke in SCD, and 
the subsequent Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) clearly demonstrated that chronic 
transfusion therapy reduces the risk of stroke in children with abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) 
velocities. This led to the inclusion of TCD screening in children with SCD as standard of care, and chronic 
blood transfusions for primary stroke prevention in those at highest risk. Although this approach has 
undoubtedly led to reduced frequency of strokes, it comes with a number of drawbacks. If a child has 
abnormal TCD velocities at 2 years of age, current guidelines would suggest that this child receive 
monthly blood transfusions indefinitely. Chronic blood transfusion therapy requires prolonged monthly 
hospital visits, costly iron chelation therapy, and oftentimes surgical procedures to implant central venous 
catheters. In addition to the cost and inconvenience, chronic transfusion therapy is associated with 
serious and life threatening haemosiderosis, most commonly in the liver, as well as the development of 
auto- or alloantibodies to erythrocyte antigens that can make it difficult to find compatible blood. For 
these reasons, the positive outcomes of the TWiTCH trial (Ware et al 2015), a multicentre, open-label, 
phase 3, non-inferiority trial, in which children with abnormal TCDs were transitioned to 
hydroxycarbamide therapy after 1 year of chronic transfusion therapy were considered. The patient 
population was carefully selected in the study, and the process of hydroxycarbamide dosing and 
monitoring was rigorous. Nevertheless, the report by Bernaudin et al (2016), a long-term cohort study, 
shows that transfusions can be stopped in real-life clinical practice not only in bone marrow transplanted 
patients, but also in a subset of patients switched to hydroxycarbamide, provided trimestrial Doppler 
Assessment report

Page 90/133 
 
 
 
follow-up is carried out and transfusions are immediately re-started in case of reversion to abnormal TCD 
velocities. Observational cohort studies have suggested that hydroxycarbamide reduces the incidence of 
primary stroke. TWiTCH was the first randomised controlled study designed to evaluate if 
hydroxycarbamide was an effective alternative for primary stroke prevention in children with SCD. The 
study was stopped early after reaching its primary end-point: TWiTCH confirmed that in children with SCD 
and abnormal TCD velocities who had received at least 1 year of CBT and had no MRI-defined severe 
vasculopathy could be safely switched to hydroxycarbamide to preserve TCD velocities and prevent 
primary stroke. Hydroxycarbamide was non-inferior to CBT for maintaining TCD velocities, after 
discontinuation of initial transfusion therapy to prevent primary stroke. There were no stroke events 
observed in either hydroxycarbamide or the chronic blood transfusion arms of the TWITCH study. The 
optimal duration of transfusions prior to changing to hydroxycarbamide was not defined by the TWiTCH 
study. The follow-up period of the TWiTCH study was short and therefore casts some doubt on the 
conclusion that hydroxycarbamide can substitute for CBT indefinitely for all patients. The applicant agrees 
that TCD velocities in some patients will revert, and this has been reported through the observation study 
by Bernaudin et al (2016). On that point however, according to the applicant, the stipulation for regular 
TCD monitoring during hydroxycarbamide treatment should not be viewed simply as a ‘safeguard’ on 
account of the lack of long term RCT data; the importance of ongoing TCD monitoring also applies to 
patients managed on CBT (i.e. regardless of treatment option). The UK Forum on Haemoglobin Disorders 
(2016) states: “Ongoing TCD scanning is recommended once a child has started on regular transfusions. 
Raised velocities may return to normal levels with transfusion, and if this fails to happen or if velocities 
increase, further investigations and interventions should be considered. The time interval for performing 
these scans should be yearly or shorter depending on the TCD velocity and the individual clinical 
circumstances.” Indeed it is recommended that all SCA patients are TCD screened at least annually from 
the age of 2 to 16 years for primary stroke prevention (UK Forum on Haemoglobin Disorders 2016) (Yawn 
& John
Sowah, 2015). 
Regarding the second indication, it cannot be justified by the TWiTCH trial. The indicated group is children 
‐
over the age of 2 years with abnormal TCD velocities (time averaged maximum mean velocity, TAMMV > 
200 cm/s). However, the subjects in the trial were in the 4-16 age group and an indication for children 
over 2 years of age cannot be justified. Also, in the TWiTCH trial most of the participants had a TCD 
velocity in the normal range at both study entry and exit, as mentioned by the authors, with a baseline 
TCD velocity of about <210 cm/s (mainly about <190 cm/s), with only 2 out of 60 subjects having TAMMV 
> 200 cm/s. The mean duration of blood transfusions before switching to hydroxyurea in the alternative 
arm was 4.5 years and therefore it is unknown whether one year of previous transfusions is sufficient time 
to switch to hydroxycarbamide, even though this was an inclusion criterion in the trial. The number of 
children that had received only one year of transfusions and the TCD results they had achieved are not 
known. The follow-up of the children switched to hydroxycarbamide might not be sufficient to reveal TCD 
reversion as has been shown in other studies (e.g. Bernaudin et al 2016). 
The applicant has proposed a conservative approach of documenting a normalised TAMMV (<170 cm/s) 
before starting hydroxycarbamide and a cautious follow-up with three monthly TCDs. However, this 
strategy was not part of the TWiTCH trial and cannot be supported by any prospective trial. The beneficial 
effect of hydroxycarbamide on TCD velocities is well-supported by several clinical observations and its use 
for stroke prevention can be recommended under specific circumstances within the context of national 
guidelines, but cannot be incorporated as an indication of the product in the lack of justification from 
prospective trials designed to prove this indication. Although the supportive studies show the beneficial 
effect of hydroxycarbamide on TCD, they cannot support the proposed indication because they were 
performed in a different setting, followed different methods, and replied to different questions. Lefevre et 
al 2008 and Lagunju et al (2015) were observational studies that compared TCD velocities in 
hydroxycarbamide treated and naïve patients. The retrospective study by Adegoke et al 2018 compared 
changes in the TCD velocities of children with SCD over a period of 6-48 months, in those not receiving 
Assessment report

Page 91/133 
 
 
 
any specific intervention (i.e. without the use of hydroxycarbamide or transfusion) with those who were 
using hydroxycarbamide. Moeen et al 2018 compared TCD velocities between patients receiving 
hydroxycarbamide or transfusions, but the procedure in TWiTCH trial was not followed i.e. previous 
transfusion and weaning until MTD of hydroxycarbamide was achieved. Overall it has not been 
documented that adopting the strict follow up with 3-monthly TCDs in routine clinical practice has a  
beneficial effect  and the frequency of investigational follow up outside clinical trials is usually either in the 
discretion of the clinician or addressed and recommended by national guidelines and not part of a specific 
product indication. In Greek Ministry guidelines, hydroxycarbamide is considered as an alternative 
approach to chronic transfusions only in patients in whom TCD is not available and the risk of stroke is 
assessed as high based on other parameters. In patients with abnormal TCD only chronic transfusions are 
recommended. 
The CHMP agreed that the second proposed indication cannot be justified as such because of the above 
mentioned arguments. However, the TWiTCH trial indeed showed that hydroxycarbamide can be effective 
in maintaining TCD velocities after an initial period of transfusions as effectively as chronic blood 
transfusions. Since stroke is also of vaso-occlusive nature (like vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest 
syndrome), the following indication was agreed: “Xromi is indicated for the prevention of vaso-occlusive 
complications of Sickle Cell Disease in patients over 2 years of age.” 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The clinical data supports the following indication: “Xromi is indicated for the prevention of vaso-occlusive 
complications of Sickle Cell Disease in patients over 2 years of age.” 
2.4.7.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile for hydroxycarbamide in people with SCD is derived from 3 RCTs that enrolled 517 
people and almost 50 observational studies that enrolled more than 3,000 people. In addition, in patient 
populations other than SCD, toxicity evidence is derived from 21 RCTs that enrolled more than 4,800 
individuals and 35 observational studies that enrolled more than 7,500 individuals (NIH Expert Panel 
Report 2014).  
Gastrointestinal disorders and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders have been known to occur 
commonly in patients receiving hydroxycarbamide. Oral mucosal ulcerations and pigmentation, 
accompanied by nausea and vomiting, epigastric pain and diarrhoea represent the most common 
reported gastrointestinal side effect of hydroxycarbamide therapy. Gastrointestinal disorders and skin 
reactions like oral, ungual and cutaneous pigmentation, rash, melanonychia, alopecia and cutaneous 
dryness are generally mild to moderate in intensity, and reversible upon discontinuation. Mostly they do 
not impact on the patient’s quality of life and have minimal clinical impact. 
Hydroxycarbamide is usually well tolerated; however, long-term hydroxycarbamide therapy has been 
associated with cutaneous side effects, such as alopecia, diffuse hyperpigmentation, erythema, skin 
atrophy, and nail changes. Painful skin ulcers have been also reported and their treatment modalities 
mainly consisted of hydroxycarbamide discontinuation, which was generally followed by the complete or 
almost complete healing (Quattrone et al 2013). There are reports of more severe forms of skin reactions 
like leg ulcers, vasculitis and panniculitis with long term use of hydroxycarbamide (Mattessich et al 2017, 
Sirieix et al 1999, Quattrone et al 2013). The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the 
hydroxycarbamide-associated cutaneous ulcer/vasculitis are not clearly defined, but probably various 
different elements play a role in their occurrence. Defective repair mechanisms in skin basal cells due to 
hydroxycarbamide cytotoxicity undoubtedly contribute to the formation of leg ulcers as well in the 
pathogenesis of all dermatologic hydroxycarbamide side effects. Long term hydroxycarbamide therapy 
leads to cumulative cytotoxicity to the basal cells of the epidermis, due to inhibition of DNA synthesis and 
Assessment report

formation of free radicals. The injury progresses until cellular repair mechanisms are no longer able to 
regenerate keratinocytes and endothelial cells. Macrocytosis is now considered to be a major pathogenic 
factor (Quattrone et al 2013). The megaloblastic changes in erythrocyte geometry and deformability 
caused by hydroxycarbamide may prevent these cells from easily traversing the capillaries. This may 
impair blood flow in the microcirculation and cause relative ischaemia in the basal layer of the skin, which 
requires more oxygen for proliferation. The painful aspect of the ulcers suggests an anoxic mechanism 
(Quattrone et al 2013). Successful therapies are also now available for management of leg 
ulcers/vasculitis (Stagno et al, 1999; Mattessich et al. 2017). 
Recovery from ulcers and vasculitis is usually rapid once hydroxycarbamide is stopped. 
Cytotoxicity with neutropenia is the first and most common manifestation of haematological suppression, 
while thrombocytopenia/anaemia occurs less frequently and is rarely seen without a preceding 
neutropenia. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is discontinued. Treatment 
can then be re-initiated at a lower dose. Cytopenias were sometimes cited as reasons for discontinuation 
from studies, although usually hydroxycarbamide therapy was temporarily stopped. Other frequently 
cited reasons for discontinuation in studies were skin toxicity and pregnancy. SCD studies which used 
dose escalation to the MTD (MSH 1995; SCATE 2015; SWiTCH 2012; TWiTCH 2015), showed greater 
rates of cytopenias, which are expected (as per the pharmacology of the drug) as the dose of the drug is 
raised. The MSH study showed increased haematological toxicity resulting in a dose reduction in the 
hydroxycarbamide group as compared with placebo, but there were no infections related to neutropenia 
or bleeding episodes due to thrombocytopenia (MSH) 1995). Similarly, the SWiTCH study showed 
significantly increased rates of reticulocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia in the hydroxycarbamide 
group, compared with transfusion (SWiTCH 2012). The BABY HUG study which used a standard dose of 20 
mg/kg of hydroxycarbamide showed an increase in neutropenia (in terms of absolute neutrophil count) in 
the hydroxycarbamide group but no increase in events of thrombocytopenia and no increase in the 
number of infections (BABY HUG 2011). Clearly, with careful laboratory monitoring and appropriate 
patient education, cytopenia should rarely represent a major issue as demonstrated in the many reported 
studies. 
Hydoxycarbamide induced symptomatic elevations in hepatic function tests appears to be a rare, 
idiosyncratic, and serious adverse event requiring discontinuation of hydroxycarbamide. The mechanism 
is likely to be direct liver toxicity, although what places an individual at risk is unknown. In the reported 
cases, the reaction is acute, starting within 1–4 weeks of initiating therapy and resolving in approximately 
48 h after discontinuation of hydroxycarbamide. Symptoms are similar in each of the case reports, with 
patients experiencing rigors, fever, abdominal pain, fatigue, and confusion; as is commonly seen in acute 
liver injury. With the exception of HIV infected individuals receiving concurrent medications, the reaction 
does not appear to be dose or disease related, occurring at doses ranging from 500 mg three times a week 
to 1000 mg daily and in patients with psoriasis, polycythaemia vera, and essential thrombocytosis 
(Sulkowski et al 2000; Westerman et al 1998; Heddle et al 1980). 
Potentially fatal pancreatitis and severe peripheral neuropathy have been reported in HIV patients who 
received hydroxycarbamide in combination with antiretroviral drugs, particularly didanosine plus 
stavudine. Median decline in CD4 cells of approximately 100/mm3 is also reported with concomitant use 
(Bloch et al 2016, Halvir et al 2001, Rutschmann et al 1998, Rutschmann et al 2000, Swindells et al 
2005). 
Also concurrent use of hydroxycarbamide and other myelosupressive products or radiation therapy may 
increase bone marrow depression, gastrointestinal disturbance and mucositis. Erythema caused by 
radiation may be aggravated by hydroxycarbamide (Lerner et al 1977).

Cutaneous vasculitis toxicities including ulcerations and gangrene are more reported in patients with 
myeloproliferative disorder if hydroxycarbamide is used concomitantly with interferon therapy or used in 
patient with prior exposure to interferon therapy. (Hydrea Label). 
The recent reports of long-term hydroxycarbamide exposure in adults with SCA provide further clinical 
evidence in support of its safety profile. The LaSHS study with 17-year follow-up demonstrated that 
hydroxycarbamide was well tolerated with mild, transient and reversible cytopenias as the only reported 
toxicities. Importantly, there were no reported cases of myelodysplasia or leukaemia in the 
hydroxycarbamide-treated patients (Voskaridou et al 2010). Long-term results from the MSH study with 
similar long-term follow-up also did not identify any long-term toxicities of hydroxycarbamide for adults 
with severe SCA, specifically no increase in cancer or stroke (Steinberg et al 2010). 
Concerns about somatic and/or germ line genotoxicity underlie the potential serious late effects of 
hydroxycarbamide. Several retrospective studies have reported abnormal sperm parameters, including 
decreased numbers, forward motility, abnormal morphology, and percentage living, in men with SCD 
before the initiation of hydroxycarbamide with a possible increase in oligospermia during and after 
treatment with hydroxycarbamide (Berthaut et al 2008). These retrospective studies were performed in 
as few as 8 participants, without any comparative semen assessment before initiation of 
hydroxycarbamide in 7 participants. Recently, a larger (n=35), but still observational, prospective study 
to assess the potential adverse impact of hydroxycarbamide treatment of sickle cell disease on 
spermatogenesis was reported (Berthaut et al 2017). Preliminary results of this study had been provided 
to the EMA in March 2013. The rapporteur acknowledged that the results were sufficiently evocative of a 
risk of male fertility impairment after 6 months of treatment with hydroxycarbamide. In view of available 
data, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) ruled that the frequency of azoospermia 
and oligospermia in hydroxycarbamide SmPC/PL should be changed from “very rare” to “very common”. 
The primary purpose of the protocol was to evaluate the impact of a treatment by hydroxycarbamide 
(15-30 mg/kg/day), 6 months after its beginning, in 35 men with sickle cell disease (range 20-51 years 
of age). The main trial criterion was the average difference of the concentration of spermatozoas 
(millions/mL) in the ejaculate, before and after 6 months of medical treatment. After 6 months of 
hydroxycarbamide therapy, the mean total sperm count had reduced 5 fold from baseline. In addition, the 
number of cryptozoospermic (n=5) and azoospermic (n=6) men increased more than 10 fold, reaching 
almost 1 in 3 patients. The investigators concluded that, at current doses, hydroxycarbamide ‘causes 
significant, rapid, and unpredictable impairment of spermatogenesis in treated men. These results may 
lead to consideration of preventive sperm cryostorage for adult patients with SCA requiring this 
treatment.’ The investigators also added that there are few data evaluating the reversibility of the 
adverse effects of hydroxycarbamide on spermatogenesis, and long-term studies are required involving 
an adequate cohort of participants for proper counselling of our patients. 
Sahoo et al (2017) reported on a prospective study of a 100 male SCD patients, aged 15 to 45 years. They 
evaluated seminal fluid indices in all patients and the effect of hydroxycarbamide on seminal fluid 
parameters. Group I included 50 patients without hydroxycarbamide therapy and Group II included 50 
patients who needed hydroxycarbamide therapy and had normal sperm parameters prior to 
hydroxycarbamide therapy. Group II patients were given low dose hydroxycarbamide therapy 10 
mg/kg/day. Seminal fluid analysis was done according to WHO criteria before starting hydroxycarbamide 
and every 3 months after initiation. In Group 1, 18% of patients developed oligospermia and 4% 
developed azoospermia. In group 2 (patients on hydroxycarbamide therapy) 20% developed 
oligospermia and 10% developed azoospermia. In 73% of patients, seminal fluid parameters reverted 
back to normal 3 months after stoppage of hydroxycarbamide. The authors concluded that alteration of 
sperm parameters is seen in a significant number of SCD patients, and is further exacerbated by 
hydroxycarbamide treatmenteven at low doses.

Building on the findings by Berthaut et al (2017), the study by Sahoo et al (2017) confirms that 
hydroxycarbamide disrupts spermatogenesis, and appears to suggest that in a majority of the patients, 
the effect on sperm was reversible, at least a low doses (10 mg/kg/day) - whether this is the case at 
higher doses remains to be shown. 
The safety profile of hydroxycarbamide for children with SCD is similar to that for adults (Ferster et al 
2001). 
Patient exposure 
The following publications mainly investigated the safety and tolerability of hydroxycarbamide. 
Bioequivalence study 
Included in the safety analysis: 28 subjects (93.3%) received Test IMP (A): Hydroxycarbamide Oral 
Solution (500 mg/5 mL), 30 subjects (100%) received Reference IMP (B): Hydrea 500 mg Capsule (UK), 
and 29 subjects (96.7%) Reference IMP (C): Hydrea 500 mg Capsule (USA). 
Berthaut et al 2017 
The primary purpose of the protocol in this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of a treatment 
by hydroxycarbamide (15-30 mg/kg/day), 6 months after its beginning, in 35 men with sickle cell disease 
(range 20-51 years of age). 
Steinberg et al 2010 
After 17 years of follow-up, 94 pregnancies were reported by female and male subjects enrolled in the 
Multicentre Study of Hydroxycarbamide in Sickle Cell Anaemia (MSH) regardless of their 
hydroxycarbamide exposure (Steinberg et al 2010). 
Laure-Joseph et al 2016 
In a recent report from the ESCORT-HU study, 1050 patients (496 children and 554 adults) were enrolled 
in ESCORT-HU from 3 European countries, from June 2008 to July 2016; Greece (11.7%), Germany 
(13.4%), and France (74.9%).  
Castro et al 2014 
Using health insurance claims databases, Castro et al (2014) compared the frequency/incidence of acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) and inpatient mortality in SCD subjects taking (n=1051), or not taking 
(n=9203) hydroxycarbamide. Patients taking hydroxycarbamide were older (median 19 vs 17 years of 
age), had a higher proportion of males (53% vs 38%), and their median hospitalizations per year was five 
times greater than in SCD patients not on hydroxycarbamide (all P < 0.001) implying greater disease 
severity. 
Zimmerman et al 2004 
Between 1995 and 2002, a total of 122 pediatric patients with SCD monitored by the Duke Pediatric Sickle 
Cell Program were treated with hydroxyurea for at least 6 months, including 106 patients with HbSS, 7 
with sickle hemoglobin C (HbSC), 7 with sickle/β-thalassemia (HbS/β-thalassemia [6 HbS/β0, 1 HbS/β+], 
and 2 with sickle hemoglobin OArab (HbS/OArab). 
Hankins et al 2014 
The Hydroxycarbamide Safety and Organ Toxicity (HUSOFT) trial was a prospective, multicentre, 
open-label, single-arm, pilot study. In the first 2-year pilot study, 28 infants (median 15 months, range 
6-28 months) with SCA, all unselected for disease severity, were prospectively treated.

Flanagan et al 2012 
The Hydroxycarbamide Study of Long Term Effects (HUSTLE, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00305175) is a 
prospective observational study of children (birth to 18 years) with SCA treated with hydroxycarbamide 
based on clinical severity, which attempts to evaluate the longterm cellular and molecular effects of 
hydroxycarbamide. The study consists of two patient groups. The first group (Old Cohort) includes 
patients previously receiving hydroxycarbamide therapy prior to enrolment on study; studies are 
completed at three-year treatment anniversaries. The second group (New Cohort) includes patients not 
on hydroxycarbamide prior to study entry, therefore allowing studies at baseline and at treatment 
anniversaries. Initial results on genotoxicity for both patient cohorts within the HUSTLE study have 
recently been analysed (Flanagan et al 2012 - n=93, age range 1.8 to 18 years). 
McGann et al 2012 
A second report from the BABY HUG trial (n=193, mean age 13.6 months) investigated the potential 
genotoxicity of in vivo hydroxycarbamide exposure by examining chromosomes directly for breakage 
abnormalities, including in vitro experiments designed to measure DNA repair capacity by directly 
examining chromosomes for abnormalities after damage induced by ionizing radiation. This report did not 
identify evidence of cumulative chromosomal damage in the hydroxycarbamide exposed group with up to 
12 years of treatment exposure (McGann et al 2012). 
Wang et al 2011 
From October 2003 to September 2007, 193 infants with HbSS (187) or Sβ0 thalassaemia (6), mean age 
13.6 months (range 9–18), were randomised at 13 clinical centers. One hundred seventy-nine (93%) 
subjects who completed at least 18 months of the trial and at least one exit assessment were analysed; 
167 (86%) completed the full study.

This study analysed the anthropometric data collected from the children enrolled in BABY HUG (193 
children aged 9-18 months. 
De Montalembert et al 2014 
ESCORT-hydroxycarbamide (clinicaltrial.gov NCT02516579) is a multicentre prospective 
non-interventional study implemented in Europe to collect more information about the safety profile of 
hydroxycarbamide and morbidity and mortality in SCD patients treated with hydroxycarbamide. 
ESCORT-hydroxycarbamide is in response to an EMA request and is an ongoing study involving the 
largest number of patients so far with SCD treated with hydroxycarbamide. Primary endpoints of ESCORT 
hydroxycarbamide are to determine frequency of AEs, and possible consequent changes of 
hydroxycarbamide treatment. Secondary endpoints are to evaluate morbidity and mortality of the 
disease although in the absence of control group. Preliminary results were presented at the 2014 
American Society of Haematology annual conference (De Montalembert et al 2014). From June 2008 to 
June 2014, 483 patients (255 females; 228 males) were enrolled from 3 European countries, Greece 
(24%), Germany (19%), and France (56%). 67% patients were adults, median aged 37.35 years 
(17-83.5) and 33% were children, median aged 11.06 years (2.6-16.9). Genotypes were HbSS in 71.4% 
cases, and compound heterozygous HbS/β-thalassemia in 22.8%.

Adverse events 
Bioequivalence study 
The safety variables were AEs, laboratory safety (biochemistry, haematology, coagulation and 
urinalysis), vital signs (systolic/diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and oral temperature), and 12-lead 
ECG (heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTcB interval). 
Adverse events (AEs)  
All AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary, version 
19.0. All AEs, including those which occurred prior to the first dose of IMP, were listed. Only treatment 
emergent adverse events (TEAEs), i.e., existing conditions that worsened or events that occurred during 
the course of the study after administration of IMP, were included within the summary tables. 
An overall summary of AEs was produced including the number of TEAEs; the number and percentage of 
subjects reporting at least 1 TEAE, serious TEAE, TEAE leading to withdrawal from the study; the number 
and % of subjects reporting TEAEs by intensity and relationship to IMP. A subject with multiple 
occurrences of any adverse event was counted once at maximum intensity or strongest relationship to 
IMP. 
The number of TEAEs and the number and percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 TEAE were 
tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. A subject reporting multiple episodes of a 
particular adverse event within a treatment period, only contributed 1 count towards the corresponding 
SOC and preferred term. 
In addition, the number and % of subjects reporting TEAEs were tabulated by maximum intensity and 
strongest relationship to IMP. For the summary of TEAEs by intensity, if a subject had multiple events 
occurring within the same SOC or preferred term the event with the highest intensity was counted. 
Similarly, for TEAEs by relationship to IMP, if a subject had multiple events occurring within the same SOC 
or preferred term, the event with the highest association to IMP was counted. 
Brief Summary of AEs 
There were a total of 10 AEs reported by 7 subjects during the study (Listing 16.2.7.1). One (1) event was 
reported by 1 subject prior to dosing (Listing 16.2.7.1) and 9 events were reported by 6 (20.0%) subjects 
post-dose (TEAE) (Table 29).

Table 29: Overall summary of TEAEs 
Of the subjects reporting TEAEs, all reported mild events which were considered to be of possible or 
unlikely relationship to the study medication (Table 29). 
When the number of subjects reporting TEAEs (related or not) were compared, there was a tendency 
towards a higher number reporting TEAEs following test IMP vs reference IMP (B) and reference IMP (C), 
although the incidence was considered low at 5 (17.9%), 2 (6.7%) and 1 (3.4%), respectively and overall 
did not raise any safety concerns (Table 30).  
The most commonly reported TEAE was headache reported by 3 (10.0%) subjects following the test IMP 
(Table 30). 
Table 30: TEAEs in each treatment group by System Organ Class and Preferred Term 
There were no serious or severe TEAEs or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) 
reported and there were no withdrawals due to TEAEs. 
All TEAEs resolved without treatment, were transient in nature and had resolved by the time of study

Vital signs parameters were listed with any out of normal range values flagged. There were no clinically 
significant changes in vital signs during the study. 
Physical Examination 
Physical examination (ear/nose/throat, ophthalmological, dermatological, cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, central nervous system, lymph nodes and musculoskeletal and other) were performed 
and results were presented by subject. There were no clinically significant physical examination findings. 
12-Lead ECG 
12-Lead ECG parameters were listed with any out of normal range values flagged. There were no clinically 
significant changes in 12-lead ECG parameters during the study. 
Concomitant Medication 
Prior and concomitant medications were presented by subject. Four (4) subjects were using ongoing 
contraception prior to first dose of IMP. Three (3) subjects were using Dianette, Depo-provera and 
Microgynon (Listing 16.2.12.1) and 1 was using the Mirena coil (Listing 16.2.4.6). No other concomitant 
medication was taken during the course of the study. Administration of the concomitant medications 
detailed above was not considered to significantly affect the collection or interpretation of the safety data 
obtained during the study. 
Palatability (test IMP only) 
Palatability questionnaire data for the test IMP was presented by subject and in summary. The 
questionnaire was optional. Thirteen (13) subjects completed the questionnaire. Of the subjects who 
completed the questionnaire, the majority thought the test IMP tasted good or very good, with no 
aftertaste or smell and with a pleasant or very pleasant texture that they would find very easy to take 
regularly (Table 31).

Berthaut et al 2017 
Concerns about somatic and/or germ line genotoxicity underlie the potential serious late effects of 
hydroxycarbamide. Several retrospective studies have reported abnormal sperm parameters, including 
decreased numbers, forward motility, abnormal morphology, and percentage living, in men with SCD 
before the initiation of hydroxycarbamide with a possible increase in oligospermia during and after 
treatment with hydroxycarbamide (Berthaut et al 2008). Recently, a larger prospective study to assess 
the potential adverse impact of hydroxycarbamide treatment of sickle cell disease on spermatogenesis 
was reported (Berthaut et al 2017).  
The main trial criterion was the average difference of the concentration of spermatozoas (millions/mL) in 
the ejaculate, before and after 6 months of medical treatment. After 6 months of hydroxycarbamide 
therapy, the mean total sperm count had reduced 5 fold from baseline. In addition, the number of 
cryptozoospermic (n=5) and azoospermic (n=6) men increased more than 10 fold, reaching almost 1 in 
3 patients. Preliminary results of this study had been provided to the EMA in March 2013. The results were 
sufficiently evocative of a risk of male fertility impairment after 6 months of treatment with 
hydroxycarbamide. In view of available data, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) 
ruled that the frequency of azoospermia and oligospermia in the SmPC/PL should be changed from “very 
rare” to “very common”. 
Zimmerman et al 2004 
A large open-label study demonstrated a modest toxicity profile and overall short-term safety of 
hydroxycarbamide at MTD in 122 children with SCA. Mild, transient and reversible cytopenias were the 
only consistently observed toxicities and there were no adverse effects on growth, development, or 
number of acquired DNA mutations (Zimmerman et al 2004). 
Hankins et al 2014 
Hydroxycarbamide was well tolerated, produced mild toxicities (predominantly transient neutropenia), 
maintained elevated Hb concentration and %HbF levels, and possibly prevented loss of spleen function 
(Hankins et al 2005). Neutropenia occurred 57 times in 17 patients and was present in 10% of all blood 
counts. Neutropenia occurred a median of twice per patient (range: 1- 10 episodes) with a median 
duration of 1 week (range: 1-4 weeks), and was associated with an intercurrent illness (usually an upper 
respiratory tract infection) in 40 episodes (70%). Neutropenia was never associated with an invasive 
bacterial infection; in 4 episodes, patients with an ANC<500×109/L were hospitalized because of fever. 
Severe anaemia occurred 7 times in 7 patients, was associated with acute illness on 4 occasions, and 
required transfusion in one patient. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 76×109/L) occurred once in 
association with a viral illness. Elevation of serum ALT (167 IU/L) occurred once without explanation and 
resolved within 1 week. Mean levels of serum ALT and creatinine were unchanged throughout the study. 
Three patients had hydroxycarbamide dose reductions for persistent or recurrent neutropenia, to 17.5 
mg/kg/day in two, and to 12.5 mg/kg/day in one. These 3 infants had an average (mean ± SD) ANC of 
2.5 ± 1.1×109/L before beginning hydroxycarbamide, compared with a pre-treatment mean ANC of 4.6 ± 
2.4×109/L in patients who did not require dose modification (P=0.11). All 21 infants completing the 
original 2-year pilot study were offered continued oral liquid hydroxycarbamide therapy. This extension of 
the original HUSOFT trial investigated the effect of hydroxycarbamide dose escalation on hematologic 
response and provides long-term prospective data regarding the safety and efficacy of hydroxycarbamide 
therapy in this cohort of very young children with SCA (Hankins et al 2014). Seventeen completed the 
extension study with dose escalation to 30 mg/kg/day. Eight of these 17 (6 girls and 2 boys, all HbSS) 
continued on daily hydroxycarbamide for at least 15 years (median age at last follow-up 17.6 years)

without interruption. All hematologic indices (Hb concentration, MCV, HbF) showed sustained effect after 
15 years. The median maximum tolerated dose of hydroxycarbamide has decreased from 30 to 26 
mg/kg/day (range 19.5–31.2); neutropenia (ANC<1.0×109/L) prompting temporary drug 
discontinuation occurred a total of 10 times in 4 subjects and there was no severe neutropenia 
(ANC<0.5×109/L). Growth rates over 15 years continued at the 50th percentile for both height and 
weight, and puberty occurred without delay (age range 10–14 years). There were 5.1 vaso-occlusive 
events (pain and ACS)/100 patient years, 7.3 packed red blood cell transfusions/100 patient years. No 
malignancies, strokes, or deaths occurred. At last follow up, all subjects were at appropriate grade level 
(10–12 grade) with no history of repeated grades (Hankins et al 2014). 
Flanagan et al 2012 
Flanagan et al 2012 reported that children (n=93, age range 1.8 to 18 years) with SCA have a 
significantly higher number of circulating micronuclei-containing erythrocytes after hydroxycarbamide 
exposure; however, this change was observed within the first 3 months of therapy and did not accumulate 
over time with up to 12 years of exposure. 
McGann et al 2012 
This report did not identify evidence of cumulative chromosomal damage in the hydroxycarbamide 
exposed group with up to 12 years of treatment exposure (McGann et al 2012). 
Wang et al 2011 
Hydroxycarbamide had an excellent safety profile in the BABY HUG Trial. Rates of significant cytopenia 
including severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia with reticulocytopenia were similar to the 
placebo group and there was no renal or liver toxicity. Children receiving hydroxycarbamide were more 
likely to have moderate neutropenia (ANC 500–1,250/mL) with 107 events vs 34 for placebo (P < 
0.0001), but no increase in bacteraemia or sepsis. Also, no differences were found in genotoxicity 
measures including chromosome and chromatid breaks, VDJ recombination events, or micronuclei assay 
results. 
Rana et al 2014 
Growth impairment is a known complication of sickle cell disease. A follow up investigation from the BABY 
HUG trial explored the effects of hydroxycarbamide on growth in very young children. Height, weight, 
BMI, and head circumference were compared with WHO standards. The treatment and placebo groups 
were compared longitudinally by using a mixed model analysis. At study entry, the z scores of BABY HUG 
children were higher than WHO standard population for height, weight and BMI, while having a 
significantly larger head circumference. After 2 years of hydroxycarbamide or placebo treatment, there 
was a downward percentile trend for weight in both treatment and placebo groups; nonetheless, the 
mean z scores remained close to the WHO norms, suggesting that there was no significant impairment of 
overall growth in either group by study end. In addition, there were no significant differences for height, 
weight, and BMI based on study treatment. There was a significant difference for the mean head 
circumference z scores at study exit (hydroxycarbamide: +0.8 vs placebo: +1.0, P=0.05). Nonetheless, 
the head circumference remained well above the WHO 50th percentile standard. Baseline z scores were 
the best predictors of z scores at study exit. The ANC, ARC, and total white blood cell count had significant 
negative correlations with growth measures (Rana et al 2014). 
Further BABY HUG and HUSTLE follow-up observational studies (clinicaltrials.gov 
#NCT00890396/NCT01783990 and #NCT00305175 respectively) will be of great value in describing the 
long-term efficacy and toxicity of hydroxycarbamide in a larger cohort of children who also have been 
treated since infancy, generally without interruption.

137 (28.4%) patients experienced 421 events (Table 32). 132 (32.2%) of these events may be attributed 
to hydroxycarbamide. The safety profile is roughly similar in children and adults. As expected the most 
frequent side effects were firstly blood disorders (n=86 events, 42.4%) such as neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia. In all cases, these cytopenias were rapidly resolved with the transitory stop of 
hydroxycarbamide. Seventy one drug related events involving skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
were observed, mostly cutaneous dryness, skin reactions, alopecia and nails or skin pigmentation; 4 
patients had a leg ulcer (34.8%). Most of these events are ongoing or stabilised despite the decrease of 
hydroxycarbamide. No secondary cancer has been reported until now.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Malignancies 
As a chemotherapeutic agent, the cytostatic effects of hydroxycarbamide are different from those of 
radiation, alkylating agents and other anti-cancer drugs, many of which are known to increase the risk of 
development of either leukaemia or cancer. There has been no evidence of malignancy in those with SCD 
treated with hydroxycarbamide in large observational studies (Steinberg 2010; Voskaridou 2010). Some 
early reports suggested that hydroxycarbamide was associated with an increased risk of leukemic 
transformation among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, which was extrapolated by both 
patients and healthcare providers to suggest hydroxycarbamide might also confer an increased risk of 
leukaemia in SCA (Weinfeld et al 1994). However, subsequent studies demonstrated that 
hydroxycarbamide does not lead to an increased risk of leukaemia for patients with myeloproliferative 
neoplasms, despite those being intrinsically preleukemic conditions (Bjorkholm et al 2011). Five 
malignancies were reported in 951 SCD patients taking hydroxycarbamide (0.5%) and 1 malignancy 
among 1736 patients not taking hydroxycarbamide (0.06%) (Gilmore et al 2011, Lobo et al 2013, Sharef 
et al 2013, Voskaridou et al 2010, Nzouakou et al 2011, Steinberg et al 2010). Three case reports were 
published after 2007 describing a hematologic malignancy presenting 4 to 15 years after starting 
hydroxycarbamide in patients with SCD (Baz et al 2012, Couronne et al 2009, Darbari et al 2011). Ex vivo 
studies of mononuclear cells taken from patients on hydroxycarbamide did not demonstrate increased 
genomic instability that might contribute to teratogenesis or leukemogenesis (McGann et al 2012). Wong 
et al (2014) in their review stated that the identification of 3 additional case reports of hematologic 
malignancies given the substantial increase in patient-years of exposure based on inclusion of more 
recent studies and ex vivo investigations does not provide adequate evidence to suggest an increased risk 
of malignancy. 
Importantly, SCD is unlike myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythaemia vera or essential 
thrombocytosis, and is not considered a pre-leukaemic condition. Many patients have taken 
hydroxycarbamide for over 10 to 20 years, with no evidence to suggest an increased risk of malignancy. 
Of course, patients with SCD carry the same risk of malignancy as the general population and numerous 
cases in the pre-hydroxycarbamide era have been reported (Schultz et al 2003). With increased survival 
due to hydroxycarbamide therapy, there will inevitably be some patients with SCD who develop 
leukaemia or other malignancies, but this should not automatically implicate hydroxycarbamide as the 
causative agent (McGann et al 2015). 
Batt et al (2015) in their review of data collected over 35 years revealed an increased prevalence of 
hematologic malignancies in the SCD population compared to the general population, predominantly of

lymphoid origin; the use of hydroxycarbamide seems to influence this finding further. In contrast, while 
there was also a notable mild increase in myeloid leukaemia diagnoses compared to the general 
population, there does not seem to be the same correlation with hydroxycarbamide. Brunson and 
colleagues conducted a cohort study of the incidence of cancers in Californian SCD patients compared to 
the general population, using population based data spanning 27 years and identifying 6423 SCD patients 
(Brunson et al 2017). SCD patients had a 72% increased risk of haematologic malignancies (leukaemia) 
and a 38% reduced risk of solid tumours. However, they did not observe a higher risk of leukaemia after 
hydroxycarbamide was approved for use in USA in 1998, suggesting that the increased risk of leukaemia 
is not related to hydroxycarbamide use. 
Castro et al 2014 
No new AML cases occurred in HC-treated paediatric SCD patients. For adults, the new AML incidence with 
HC exposure was 10.7/10,000 patient years, vs 4.0/10,000 patient years in subjects not on HC (P=0.2), 
a possible AML risk ratio of 3.18. Adjustment for a probable database bias for AML 
diagnosis/ascertainment lowered the risk ratio to 0.94 (95% CI=0.16-5.47) i.e. no increased risk for AML 
with HC treatment. Despite their greater disease severity, the inpatient mortality in SCD adults prescribed 
HC (0.29%) was lower than that of patients not taking the drug (0.42%, P=0.032). 
Teratogenic effects 
Some teratogenic effects of hydroxycarbamide have been observed in foetuses of treated pregnant 
rodents (Woo et al 2004, Katayama et al 2004; Yan and Hales 2005; Chahoud and Paumgartten 2009). 
Hydroxycarbamide has been demonstrated to be embryotoxic at doses over 150 mg/kg/day in rats and in 
monkeys (Liebelt, et al 2007). Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased foetal viability, reduced 
live litter sizes, and developmental delays. On the other hand, a recent study on pregnant mice showed 
no evidence of teratogenic effects with intraperitoneal injection of hydroxycarbamide (25 mg/kg) on 
gestation day (GD) 7.5 (Guan et al 2015; Laure-Joseph et al 2016). Evidence of adverse outcomes and 
teratogenic effects in humans exposed to hydroxycarbamide in utero is limited. An expert panel report 
evaluating the toxicity of hydroxycarbamide has led to recommendations that hydroxycarbamide is 
stopped in men and women who are trying to conceive and in breastfeeding women (National Toxicology 
Program 2008). The risks of stopping hydroxycarbamide whilst attempting conception should be carefully 
discussed with the individual.  
Steinberg et al 2010 
Of female subjects with known hydroxycarbamide exposure at conception or during gestation and by 
male subjects with known exposure at the time of conception, 16 pregnancy outcomes were reported with 
8 live births (6 term and 2 premature deliveries), 5 elective abortions, and 3 spontaneous abortions. Of 
the live births, no birth defects were described, consistent with findings in 3 other studies reporting 
pregnancy outcomes (Gilmore et al 2011; Voskaridou et al 2010; Berthaut et al 2008). 
Laure-Joseph et al 2016 
Among the 315 women with childbearing potential (aged more than 15 to 49 years), 28 pregnancies in 27 
women treated with HU have been reported despite the information to stop HU before conception (Table 
35). Clinical data regarding the newborn are reported for 7 pregnancies with HU exposure and no 
malformations were observed. In this series nested in the ESCORT HU cohort, pregnancies occurred 
safely despite exposure to hydroxycarbamide (Laure-Joseph et al 2016).

Deaths 
Deaths occurred rarely. The deaths observed are not alarming. It is not sure if they can be attributed to 
the drug in the MSH trial, since they seem not statistically significant compared to placebo. De 
Montalembert et al 2006 that reported one death is a PK study. Gulbis et al 2005 say that the death 
observed should not be interpreted as toxic death, but rather as a lack of efficacy of hydroxycarbamide. 
The death in Scott et al 1996 was unrelated to hyroxycarbamide treatment. The two deaths in Hankins et 
al 2005 and Wang et al 2001 are not discussed. In Rigano et al 2017 14 deaths were reported, but a 
Kaplan-Meier plot showed that hydroxycarbamide hazard ratio is 0.22. Also, in Voskaridou et al 2010, 13 
deaths happened in the hydroxycarbamide arm vs 49 in the non-hydroxycarbamide arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Studies have shown that, due to the structural similarity of the drug with urea, uric acid, and lactic acid, 
there is an analytical interference of hydroxycarbamide with the enzymes (urease, uricase, and lactate 
dehydrogenase) used in the determination of urea, uric acid and lactic acid, rendering falsely elevated 
results of these in patients treated with hydroxycarbamide (Restituto et al 2006). 
Safety in special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Impaired renal function is a relatively frequent and serious complication in patients with SCD. These 
patients commonly develop proteinuria, which may progress to the nephrotic syndrome and end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD). In an open single-dose study in adult patients with Sickle Cell disease (Yan et al, 
2005) the influence of renal function on pharmacokinetics of hydroxycarbamide was assessed. Patients 
with normal renal function (creatinine clearance CrCl>90 ml/min, n=7), mild (CrCl 60–89 ml/min, n=2), 
moderate (CrCl 30 - 59 ml/min, n=3), or severe (CRCL 15-29 ml/min, n=3) renal impairment, and End 
Stage Renal Disease (ESRD, n = 3), with 2 of them on maintenance haemodialysis. Except for patients 
with ESRD, all the patients received a 15-mg/kg single oral dose of hydroxycarbamide (Droxia capsules). 
Patients with ESRD received a 15-mg/kg oral dose of hydroxycarbamide on 2 occasions. Blood and urine 
samples were collected for the assessment of hydroxycarbamide pharmacokinetics. As the degree of 
renal impairment worsened, the systemic exposure to hydroxycarbamide increased, and the urinary 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 111/133 
 
 
 
 
 
recovery decreased. The mean AUC0-∞ was increased by 88%, 70%, 62%, 80%, and 152% for patients 
with mild, moderate, severe renal function impairment, and ESRD with and without hemodialysis, 
respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. The changes in CLtotal/F, CLrenal, and 
t1/2 were also generally in keeping with this trend (i.e., higher exposure, lower clearance, and longer 
half-life). On the basis of the altered pharmacokinetic parameters in renally impaired patients, the 
authors proposed an initial dosing regimen of hydroxycarbamide (7.5 mg/kg/day) for SCD patients with 
CLcr <60 mL/min. Systemic exposure is likely to be unpredictable in patients with moderate to severe 
renal impairment (CrCL<30ml/min).  
Impaired hepatic function 
No studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics of hydroxycarbamide in hepatically impaired patients, 
but bearing in mind hepatic elimination is a significant component of overall elimination, perhaps up to 
60%, it is prudent to assume that clearance of hydroxycarbamide will be reduced in patients with severe 
liver dysfunction and therefore careful monitoring of response is required. Systemic exposure is likely to 
be unpredictable in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Immunological events 
There are no literature data, however considering that the normal defence mechanisms may be 
suppressed by hydroxycarbamide treatment, concomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus 
vaccine may potentiate the replication of the vaccine virus and/or increase the adverse drug reaction of 
the vaccine virus. According to Lederman et al 2014, children with SCD receiving hydroxyurea had lower 
lymphocyte, CD4, and memory T-cell counts compared with those receiving placebo, but still in the range 
for healthy children. Because infants and young children are immunologically immature and their primary 
lymphoid organs must produce large numbers of naive T and B lymphocytes, the effects of hydroxyurea 
could be greater in this age group than in older children and adults.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
A justification was provided with regards to the concomitant use with antiretroviral drugs, particularly 
didanosine plus tavudine, other myelosupressive products or radiation therapy, interferon therapy, and 
live virus vaccines. Please see discussion on clinical safety. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The majority of discontinuations reported were due to cytopenias, however often treatment has resumed 
after temporary cessation of therapy. Failure of therapy and pregnancy were cited in some studies as 
frequent reasons for discontinuation. 
2.4.8.  Post marketing experience 
There is no current commercial experience to report with Xromi since the product has no marketing 
authorisation in any jurisdiction. 
Safety data provided are mainly from the last decade. However, most of them originate from clinical or 
retrospective studies and not from spontaneous reporting. Pharmacovigilance data may provide 
increased and useful post-marketing experience and identify new safety issues.  
A new signal with hydroxycarbamide has been confirmed by the PRAC in February 2018 concerning Lupus 
erythematosus. The applicant updated the SmPC and PIL to add the information proposed by PRAC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 112/133 
 
 
 
 
The applicant has also investigated the available pharmacovigilance data, using Eudravigilance database 
(L1 level access) to discuss further the post-marketing experience and add any new identified issues in 
the SmPC, in order to complete the safety profile of hydroxycarbamide. It was concluded from the review 
that there are currently no additional data concerning possible signals. The established safety profile of 
hydroxycarbamide is confirmed both for the oncology indications and for the SCD indication (although to 
a lesser degree as there are fewer cases to examine).  
The safety profile of all products containing hydroxycarbamide in the EEA has been recently thoroughly 
reassessed through the relevant PSUSA procedures. The assessment of the PSUR of Siklos 
(centrally-authorised product, SCD indication) was finalised in January 2018 without any variation. In 
September 2018, the assessment of the PSUR of non-centrally authorised hydroxycarbamide products, 
including Hydrea, was finalised with a recommendation for variation (update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC to add the adverse reaction interstitial lung disease with a frequency unknown and to add a warning 
on patients with respiratory symptoms. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to add a warning concerning 
skin cancer. The Package Leaflet to be updated accordingly). It should be noted that two of the products 
in the PSUSA are indicated also for SCD.   
Overdose 
After an acute oral overdose, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation may occur but toxicity is 
mainly due to bone marrow suppression. Megaloblastic changes are detectable within 48 hours of dosing. 
Reversible myelosuppression affecting all haematological compartments (but particularly the white cells) 
may develop 1-2 weeks after exposure especially following doses greater than 800 mg/m2. Lower doses 
will produce myelosuppression if renal function is impaired. Acute mucocutaneous toxicity (hand and foot 
erythema and scaling, generalised hyperpigmentation and acute stomatitis) has also been reported 
(Toxbase Hydroxycarbamide Monograph). 
A 2-year-old child ingested at one time an entire 35-day supply of hydroxycarbamide (612 mg/kg body 
weight). Despite a serum level of 7,756 μM 4 hours post-ingestion, the only toxicity was transient mild 
myelosuppression (Miller et al, 2012). 
A 3-year-old child who ingested up to 9 g of his mother’s hydroxycarbamide was treated with gastric 
lavage and activated charcoal within 1 hour of ingestion. He remained asymptomatic, and his initial blood 
counts demonstrated only mild leukocytosis (usual for the patient). His WBC dropped to low normal 
values at 2 weeks after ingestion, and spontaneously returned to his usual values within two weeks 
afterwards (Cole et al, 2010). 
A 50-year-old female receiving hydroxycarbamide treatment for thrombocythaemia took an overdose of 
up to 60 g of hydroxycarbamide with ethanol. She presented with agitation, myoclonic jerks and 
hyper-reflexia. She was drowsy at presentation, becoming unconscious with GCS 5/15 at 12 hours after 
overdose, when she also developed an oculogyric crisis, which was responsive to procyclidine. Blood 
counts started dropping at 5 days after presentation, and neutrophils reached a nadir that was below 
detectable limits at day 8, after which she gradually recovered. She had been treated with G-CSF starting 
from day 7 after presentation. She was discharged after 11 days when her full blood count stabilised, and 
hydroxycarbamide treatment was subsequently reintroduced (Litt et al, 2013). 
Pregnancy and lactation 
In a 17 year follow up study, 94 pregnancy outcomes were reported; 52 in 28 females exposed to 
hydroxycarbamide and 42 in female partners of 27 male patients exposed to hydroxycarbamide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 113/133 
 
 
 
No relationship between hydroxycarbamide usage and neonatal abnormalities or teratogenic effects was 
found. Foetuses of those pregnancies that were not terminated and resulted in full-term or premature live 
births were normal with no evidence of any neonatal abnormalities or teratogenic effects. This seems to 
be true whether the parent taking hydroxycarbamide was the mother or father. Additional studies 
including much longer follow-up of many more hydroxycarbamide exposed sickle cell disease patients are 
required to establish these results conclusively. 
Evidence from a patient taking hydroxycarbamide for myelogenous leukaemia shows that 
hydroxycarbamide is excreted into human breast milk. The patient was receiving 500 mg orally 3 times 
daily, with milk samples collected 2 hours following the last dose of the drug each day for 7 days. Only 3 
samples were reported to clear adequately following the extraction process to ensure reliable 
spectrophotometric readings; these concentrations were 6.1, 3.8, and 8.4 mg/L on days 1, 3, and 4, 
respectively (mean, 6.1 mg/L). At these concentrations, it was calculated 3 to 4 mg/day would be 
received by the infant. Although amounts ingested by a breastfeeding infant would appear to be low, it is 
recommended that hydroxycarbamide be avoided during the breastfeeding period, with the pre-clinical 
evidence of teratogenic effects and the undetermined clinical effects of exposure (Sylvester et al 1987).  
Other safety issues 
Strawberry flavour excipient 
Strawberry liquid flavour is a synthetic flavour. The strawberry flavour is a mixture of various natural and 
synthetic flavouring substances along with other ingredients.  
The manufacturer has provided a number of compliance statements. The strawberry flavour utilises 
ingredients that are listed as GRAS, comply with the provisions of the EU Regulation 1334/2008 on 
flavourings, and all flavouring substances are listed in Annex I Part A of this Regulation, as amended 
(Union list of flavouring substances adopted by EU Regulation No. 872/2012). They also confirm that any 
additive used in the manufacture of the strawberry flavour is listed in Annex II Part B and/or Annex III 
Part 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on Food Additives and is in compliance with the specifications set 
out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 laying down specifications for food additives, both 
regulations as amended. The flavour is confirmed to be TSE free. The strawberry flavour does not contain 
any EU allergens nor does it contain any ingredient for which there may be concern for paediatric use 
(propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, ethanol and colours). 
The levels of strawberry flavour included in the formulation is within the range recommended by the 
manufacturer and, in combination with the sucralose, was determined through informal, internal taste 
testing. The palatability (taste, aftertaste, smell, texture, ease of use and other comments) of the final 
formulation was assessed by questionnaire as part of the bioequivalence study (RD 729/26118) following 
completion of dosing. Completion of the questionnaire by the participants was optional. Thirteen (out of 
28) subjects completed the questionnaire. Of the subjects who completed the palatability questionnaire, 
the majority thought the test IMP tasted good (38.5%) or very good (46.2%), with no aftertaste (84.6%) 
or smell (53.8%) and with a pleasant (38.5%) or very pleasant (30.8%) texture that 84.6% stated would 
find very easy to take regularly. 
In addition, an evaluation of the ‘acceptability and palatability’ of Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories in 
the paediatric SCD population will be conducted as part of a planned observational PK study in children 
aged 6 months – 18 years. 
Syringes 
The possibility of a medication error because of the inclusion of two different syringes in the same 
package was highlighted during evaluation. The applicant updated the product information in order to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 114/133 
 
 
 
decrease this possibility. Explanation text with guidance on which syringe to use in each case has been 
incorporated into the SmPC, Section 4.2 Method of Administration, and a diagram showing the package 
contents and the different color of the syringes has been added in the PIL. If a patient has to receive 12-15 
ml, the combined use of the two syringes will provide a higher degree of accuracy. 
The two syringes cover the required volumes for children 2-9 years old. However, the product’s indication 
is not only for children, but for adults as well. An adult weighing e.g. 80 kg would need 28 ml of liquid for 
a 35 mg/kg dose, meaning that the 12 ml syringe should be used three times. The Applicant claims that 
few adults tolerate the maximum 35 mg/kg/day dose. Indeed, long term studies show that the mean 
maintenance dose in SCD patients is approximately 20 mg/kg/day (Voskaridou et al 2010, Rigano et al 
2018), so that a typical 80 kg patient would need 16 ml of liquid, achievable with two uses of the 12 ml 
syringe. The syringe volume should be chosen to serve even the extreme cases (e.g. maximum 35 
mg/kg/day dose). However, it is acknowledged that the choice of a larger size that would result in 
maximum of two uses (e.g. 18 ml) would result in an advantage for a few patients with a possible risk 
(inaccurate dose) for more patients. Section 4.2 of the SmPC provides a recommendation that in adults 
without swallowing difficulties, solid oral formulations may be more appropriate and convenient. 
Regarding ease of use of the syringes, information on all centrally authorised products and authorised 
products in UK and Greece that are administered with syringes was provided. Among these there are no 
products administered with 12 ml syringe, but there are 3 products administered with 20 ml syringes. A 
12 ml syringe will not be harder to use than a 20 ml syringe. Therefore, the proposed volume is 
acceptable. A usability and clinical performance statement by the supplier has been submitted. Regarding 
reproducibility, a submitted reproducibility study shows that the syringes deliver accurately the intended 
volume. 
2.4.9.  Discussion on clinical safety aspects 
The applicant has provided data from a comparative safety study, RCTs, and observational studies that 
altogether have included a substantial number of patients. Most of these studies have been conducted 
after the authorisation of Siklos in EU (2007) and can therefore broaden the body of information on 
hydroxycarbamide safety obtained till then.  
In general, hydroxycarbamide shows mild toxicity. The most frequent AEs reported in the submitted 
studies are cytopenias, skin disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and neurological disorders. Cytopenias, 
that are caused by bone marrow depression, a pharmacological effect of hydroxycarbamide, are mild, 
transient and reversible. The safety profile of adults and children appears to be similar. The most common 
side effects are bone marrow depression including neutropenia, reticulocytopenia, macrocytosis, 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia, headache, dizziness, nausea, constipation, skin ulcer, oral, nail and skin 
hyperpigmentation, dry skin and alopecia. 
Preclinical toxicity studies have demonstrated the most commonly observed effects include bone marrow 
depression in rats, dogs and monkeys. Therefore a warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The complete status of the blood, including bone marrow examination, if indicated, as well as kidney 
function and liver function should be determined prior to, and repeatedly during, treatment. If bone 
marrow function is depressed, treatment with hydroxycarbamide should not be initiated. Continuous 
follow-up of the growth of treated children and adolescents is recommended. The full blood cell count with 
white cell differential, reticulate count, and platelet count should be monitored regularly (see section 4.2 
of the SmPC). Hydroxycarbamide may produce bone marrow suppression; leukopenia is generally its first 
and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anaemia occur less often and are seldom seen 
without a preceding leukopenia. Bone marrow depression is more likely in patients who have previously 
received radiotherapy or cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic medicinal products; hydroxycarbamide 
should be used cautiously in such patients. The recovery from myelosuppression is rapid when 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 115/133 
 
 
 
hydroxycarbamide therapy is interrupted. Hydroxycarbamide therapy can then be re-initiated at a lower 
dose (see section 4.2). Xromi is contraindicated in toxic ranges of myelosuppression as described in 
section 4.2. of the SmPC. 
Severe anaemia must be corrected with whole blood replacement before initiating therapy with 
hydroxycarbamide. If, during treatment, anaemia occurs, correct without interrupting hydroxycarbamide 
therapy. Erythrocytic abnormalities; megaloblastic erythropoiesis, which is self-limiting, is often seen 
early in the course of hydroxycarbamide therapy. The morphologic change resembles pernicious 
anaemia, but is not related to vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency. The macrocytosis may mask the 
incidental development of folic acid deficiency; regular determinations of serum folic acid are 
recommended. Hydroxycarbamide may also delay plasma iron clearance and reduce the rate of iron 
utilisation by erythrocytes but it does not appear to alter the red blood cell survival time. 
Hydroxycarbamide affects spermatogenesis, and hence oligospermia and azoospermia are very 
commonly reported.  
Although there are concerns that hydroxycarbamide might be leukemogenic, submitted data do not 
support this hypothesis. Teratogenesis has not been observed in humans, however, because of the small 
number of studied births and of malformations observed in animals, a warning is given. Excipients 
present in the product do not pose safety dangers. Xromi is contraindicated in pregnant and breast 
feeding women (see section 4.3 and 4.6 of the SmPC).  
Xromi is also contraindicated with concomitant use of anti-retroviral medicinal products for HIV disease 
(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Since renal excretion is a pathway of elimination, consideration should be given to decreasing the dosage 
of hydroxycarbamide in renally impaired patients. In patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 60 
ml/min the initial hydroxycarbamide dose should be decreased by 50%. Close monitoring of blood 
parameters is advised in these patients (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Hydroxycarbamide must not be 
administered to patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/min) (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 
5.2). 
There are no data that support specific dose adjustments in patients with hepatic impairment. Close 
monitoring of blood parameters is advised in these patients. Due to safety considerations, 
hydroxycarbamide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 
and 4.4).  
Hydroxycarbamide must not be used in combination with anti-retroviral medicinal products for HIV 
disease and it may cause treatment failure and toxicities (in some cases fatal) in HIV patients (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Concomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the 
vaccine virus and/or may increase some of the adverse reactions of the vaccine virus because normal 
defence mechanisms may be suppressed by hydroxycarbamide. Vaccination with a live vaccine in a 
patient taking hydroxycarbamide may result in severe infection. The patient's antibody response to 
vaccines may be decreased. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment and for at least 
six months after treatment has finished and individual specialist advice sought (see section 4.4 and 4.5 of 
the SmPC). 
Hydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic in a wide range of test systems. Hydroxycarbamide is 
presumed to be a transspecies carcinogen (see section 4.4 and 5.3 of the SmPC).  
Management of an acute hydroxycarbamide overdose should ideally be discussed with the physician 
responsible for prescribing cytotoxic drug or a haematologist. The benefit of gastric decontamination, e.g. 
activated charcoal is uncertain, but nevertheless should be considered if the patient presents within 1 
Assessment report

Page 116/133 
 
 
 
hour of ingestion of any amount (because of risk of myelosuppression at all doses). Patients should be 
monitored for vital signs, blood and urine chemistry, renal and hepatic function and full blood counts for 
at least 3 weeks.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a hybrid version of Hydrea 500mg. The reference product Hydrea is indicated 
for treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia and cancer of the cervix in conjunction with radiotherapy. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
One bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with cross-over design under fasting conditions. The 
study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line 
with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points and overall sampling time as 
well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and 
statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Xromi met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with 
Hydrea. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-72h, 
and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 
125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Xromi is intended for the prevention of vaso-occlusive complications of Sickle Cell Disease in patients over 
2 years of age.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
SCD management consists of patient health maintenance and monitoring, symptom control, and 
disease-modifying treatment. Disease-modifying treatment includes blood transfusion and oral 
hydroxycarbamide administration. Because chronic blood transfusion is inevitably associated with iron 
overload, iron chelating drugs are administered e.g. desferrioxamine and deferasirox. Haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is recognised as the only cure. However, it is a rather new approach (25 
years old) that has been applied only to a few hundred patients worldwide. 
In 2007 Siklos 100 mg film-coated tablets was granted authorisation in European Union, with the 
indication of “prevention of recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises including acute chest syndrome in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 126/133 
 
 
 
adults, adolescents and children older than 2 years suffering from symptomatic Sickle Cell Syndrome”. 
Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories 100 mg/ml oral solution covers the unmet medical need of a 
palatable oral liquid formulation for children and patients with dysphagia. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant has conducted a bioequivalence study comparing Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories 100 
mg/mL oral solution to Hydrea capsules (UK and USA). Thirty (30) healthy subjects participated. 
Four main clinical studies were submitted by the applicant: MSH (Charache et al 1995), Jain et al 2012, 
Ferster et al 1996, TWiTCH (Ware et al 2015).  
The MSH study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 299 adults with SCA 
who had experienced three or more VOCs in the previous year. The clinical end point of three or more 
documented VOCs was chosen because of earlier data documenting that people who experience pain at 
that frequency had markedly lower survival rates. The trial was conducted to test the hypothesis that Jain 
et al 2012) 
Jain et al 2012 was a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study conducted in a tertiary hospital 
in India. The study was conducted in children with sickle cell anemia (proportion with each genotype not 
stated) between the ages of 5 and 18 years with three or more blood transfusions or vaso-occlusive crises 
requiring hospitalization per year despite high HbF. The primary endpoint was the decrease in 
vaso-occlusive crises per patient per year. Secondary outcomes were a decrease in frequency of blood 
transfusions and hospitalizations and an increase in HbF levels. 
Ferster et al 1996 was a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study. It was conducted in a single 
centre in Belgium and involved 25 children and young adults (age range: 2 to 22 years) with HbSS 
genotype and severe clinical manifestations (defined as >3 vaso-occlusive crises in the year before study 
entry and/or with previous history of stroke, acute chest pain, recurrent crises without a free interval, or 
splenic sequestration) with the primary end-point of number of hospitalizations and number of days in 
hospital. 
TWiTCH was a NHLBI-funded Phase III multicentre RCT comparing 24-months of standard treatment 
(transfusions) to alternative treatment (hydroxycarbamide) in 121 children with SCA and abnormal TCD 
velocities. All eligible children had received at least 12 months of transfusions and did not have severe 
vasculopathy. TWiTCH had a non-inferiority trial design; the primary study endpoint was the 24-month 
TCD velocity obtained from a linear mixed model, controlling for baseline (enrolment) values, with a 
non-inferiority margin of 15 cm/s.  
Regarding safety, the profile for hydroxycarbamide in people with SCD is derived from the bioequivalence 
study that was conducted by the applicant and enrolled 30 people and literature data (3 RCTs that 
enrolled 517 people, and almost 50 observational studies that enrolled more than 3,000 people). In 
addition, in patient populations other than SCD, toxicity evidence is derived from 21 published RCTs that 
enrolled more than 4,800 individuals and 35 observational studies that enrolled more than 7,500 
individuals. Among all these studies, the bioequivalence study and the ESCORT-HU study (De 
Montalembert et al 2014) can be regarded as the main safety studies based on the fact that they were the 
only ones to tabulate the AEs according to SOC and frequency. ESCORT-HU is a multicentre prospective 
non-interventional study implemented in Europe involving the largest number of patients so far with SCD 
treated with hydroxycarbamide. Primary endpoints of ESCORT hydroxycarbamide were to determine 
frequency of adverse events, and possible consequent changes of hydroxycarbamide treatment. 
Secondary endpoints were to evaluate morbidity and mortality of the disease although in the absence of 
control group. From June 2008 to June 2014, 483 patients (255 females; 228 males) were enrolled from 
3 European countries, Greece (24%), Germany (19%), and France (56%). 67% patients were adults,

median aged 37.35 years (17-83.5) and 33% were children, median aged 11.06 years (2.6-16.9). 
Genotypes were HbSS in 71.4% cases, and compound heterozygous HbS/β-thalassemia in 22.8%. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The bioequivalence study conducted by the applicant showed that Xromi 100 mg/ml oral solution is 
bioequivalent to Hydrea capsules. This means that bridging with Hydrea-based literature is possible. 
MSH trial showed beneficial effects to patients receiving hydroxycarbamide compared to those receiving 
placebo. A difference of 44% in the frequency of painful VOCs per year (2.5 vs 4.5, P<0.001) was 
observed in favor of hydroxycarbamide. When taking into account only crises severe enough to cause 
hospitalisation, this difference increased to 58% (1.0 vs 2.4, P<0.001). Also, a statistically significant 
elongation of the time until the first (3.0 vs 1.5, P=0.01) and second VOC (8.8 vs 4.6, P<0.001) was 
observed in patients receiving hydroxycarbamide. Finally, the number of patients in whom chest 
syndrome developed was significantly smaller when receiving hydroxycarbamide (25 vs 51, P<0.001). 
Jain et al 2012 study showed that hemoglobin levels and HbF percentages increased significantly in the 
HU treated group compared to baseline of HU group and 18 months of placebo group. With HU therapy, 
event rates per patient per year for vaso-occlusive crises, blood transfusions and hospitalizations 
decreased by 95.0, 94.6 and 93.1%, respectively. When compared with the placebo group, patients 
treated with HU therapy had 94.0, 93.4 and 89.5% lesser vaso-occlusive crises, blood transfusions, and 
hospitalizations, respectively. Even among hospitalized patients, the duration of hospitalization was less 
in the HU group (3.1 ± 1.2 days) than their counterparts in the placebo group (7.1 ± 2.1 days). 
Ferster et al 1996 showed that the number of hospitalizations was significantly reduced when patients 
were on HU therapy as compared with placebo. Combining the results of both periods, 16 patients of 22 
(73%) did not require any hospitalisation for painful episodes when treated with HU as compared with 
only 3 of 22 (14%) when treated with placebo. The number of days in hospital was also significantly lower 
when patients were on HU therapy (range, 0 to 19 days) than when they were on placebo (range, 0 to 104 
days). During the first 6-month period, the mean number of days in hospital was 5.3 days for HU, as 
compared with 15.2 days for placebo; during the second 6-month period, these figures were, 
respectively, 1.8 days for HU and 8.2 days for placebo.  
TWiTCH trial showed non-inferiority (P=8.82×10–1
transfusions when the final model-based TCD velocity difference was assessed (4.54 cm/s, 95% CI: 
⁶)
 for hydroxycarbamide compared to standard 
0.10–8.98 cm/s). TCD acts as a surrogate for stroke risk. Also, the difference of liver iron concentration 
from baseline was more favorable for the hydroxycarbamide treatment (final concentration difference 
between the two treatments was 4.3 mg Fe per g dry weight liver, P<0.001). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Patients that participated in the MSH, Jain et al 2012, and Ferster et al 1996 trials were suffering from 
SCA; patients with different genotypes than HbSS and HbSβ0 thalassemia did not participate. This means 
that based only on this trial, an indication to all SCD patients (including rarer genotypes) is not supported. 
However, supportive studies that have been submitted can be used to extrapolate the indication to SCD. 
In the investigational arm of TWiTCH trial 60 children were treated with hydroxycarbamide. The median 
duration of transfusion history in this arm was 4.5 years. The follow-up of the trial is also relatively short 
(24 months) for children that have been transfused so extensively before enrolment and continued to 
receive transfusions during an overlap period the duration of which was defined 4-9 months. Even the 
authors suggest that the optimal duration of transfusions prior changing to hydroxycarbamide has not 
been defined and that the follow-up period might be short to reveal any reversion of TCD as it was shown 
in the non-randomised trial of Bernaudin et al 2016 with a longer follow-up. Bernaudin et al 2016, a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 128/133 
 
 
 
supportive study giving positive results for 45 patients, has differences with TWiTCH study e.g. only 
patients with normalised velocities and no stenosis were switched to hydroxycarbamide, MTD was not 
always reached etc. Bernaudin et al 2016 was a longitudinal prospective observational cohort study with 
no control group. Effectiveness or net benefits cannot be inferred. Therefore the initially applied indication 
for primary stroke prevention was not accepted as such. The following indication was agreed by CHMP: 
“Prevention of vaso-occlusive complications of Sickle Cell Disease in patients over 2 years of age”. This 
indication leaves the freedom to clinicians to use it for primary stroke prevention according to published 
studies and guidelines. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Regarding safety, hydroxycarbamide is an active substance that has been used for many years in SCD 
patients, both off-label (Hydrea) and authorised (Siklos, from 2007 in European Union). This means that 
its safety profile is well characterised. 
The majority of the unfavourable effects of the active substance concerning AEs derive from literature 
data. In general, hydroxycarbamide shows mild toxicity. The most frequent AEs reported in the submitted 
studies are cytopenias, skin disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and neurological disorders. Cytopenias, 
that are caused by bone marrow depression, a pharmacological effect of hydroxycarbamide, are mild, 
transient and reversible. The safety profile of adults and children appears to be similar. Although there are 
concerns that hydroxycarbamide might be leukemogenic, submitted data do not support this hypothesis. 
Teratogenesis has not been observed in humans, however because of the small number of studied births 
and of malformations observed in animals, a contraindication has been added in section 4.3 of the SmPC.  
The two important identified risks are oligospermia/azoospermia in males and myelosuppression. Many 
important potential risks have been recognised concerning Xromi. These include mutagenicity and 
carcinogenicity (although according to submitted literature it seems that there is no significant danger), 
off-label use in the oncology indications not approved for this formulation, off-label use for chronic severe 
anaemia–thalassemia/polycythaemia, potential medication errors (conversion of patients from tablet to 
liquid formulation, two dosing syringes), skin ulceration and vasculitis, off-label use in children <2 years 
old, concurrent use of hydroxycarbamide and other myelosuppressive medicinal products or radiation 
therapy, interaction with live bacterial or virus vaccines, the effect on embryogenesis, teratogenic 
potential, breastfeeding and post-natal development, safety of hydroxycarbamide in patients with 
underlying hepatic or renal impairment and lupus erythematosus. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Regarding safety, the applicant has submitted data from both Hydrea and non-Hydrea literature. Since 
the Applicant was able to show that non-Hydrea literature can be used based on the Quality attributes of 
non-Hydrea formulations (dissolution, excipients) all submitted data are acceptable. 
There is missing information in literature concerning long-term safety effects in children. This will be 
obtained and evaluated through PSUR.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Three studies (384 adults and children with HbSS or HbSβºthal) compared hydroxycarbamide to placebo, 
recruiting individuals with severe disease (MSH trial; Jain et al 2012; Ferster et al 1996). There was 
statistically significant reduction in vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome. There were no 
consistent statistically significant differences in terms of quality of life and adverse events (including 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/170631/2019  
Page 129/133 
 
 
 
serious or life-threatening events). Seven deaths occurred during the studies, but the rates by treatment 
group were not statistically significantly different. Supportive studies help extrapolating the positive 
results to SCD patients. In the TWiTCH study, hydroxycarbamide was compared with transfusion in 
children with abnormal TCD velocities who had received transfusion for at least one year and had no 
evidence of vasculopathy on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Hydroxycarbamide was as effective 
as transfusion in preventing further stroke and final TCD velocity was lower in the hydroxycarbamide 
group. However, there are limitations on this favourable effect, as described above. Therefore the initially 
applied indication for primary stroke prevention was not accepted as such. The following indication was 
agreed by CHMP: “Prevention of vaso-occlusive complications of Sickle Cell Disease in patients over 2 
years of age”. This indication leaves the freedom to clinicians to use it for primary stroke prevention 
according to published studies and guidelines. The bioequivalence shown between Hydroxycarbamide 
Nova Laboratories 100 mg/mL and Hydrea capsules is useful for bridging with Hydrea-based literature 
data. In vitro dissolution tests with non-Hydrea formulations used in the literature, the presence of 
excipients not affecting bioavailability, and the fact that hydroxycarbamide was shown to be highly 
soluble-highly permeable compound, allow bridging also with non-Hydrea literature. 
Regarding safety, hydroxycarbamide profile is well characterised and shows mild toxicity.   
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the benefit-risks of Xromi is considered positive in the proposed indication. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Xromi is favourable in the following indication: 
“Hydroxycarbamide Nova Laboratories is indicated for the prevention of vaso-occlusive complications of 
Sickle Cell Disease in patients over 2 years of age.”

Iron  is  an  essential  micronutrient  that  is  required  for  adequate  erythropoietic  function,  oxidative 
metabolism  and  cellular immune  responses.  The  term  “anaemia”  is  sometimes  used  synonymously  with 
“iron  deficiency  anaemia”.  However,  these  terms  do  not  cover  the  same  reality.  There  are  about  2-5 
times more iron deficient people than individuals with IDA. Iron deficiency is diagnosed when low serum 
levels of ferritin or transferrin saturation are measured. The most common reasons for ID are insufficient 
iron  intake  in  the  diet,  an  inability  to  absorb  iron  well  in  the  body  and/or  loss  of  iron  in  blood  through 
bleeding. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia is caused by low 
levels  of  iron  in  the  body.  Iron  deficiency  anaemia  is  the  most  common  cause  of  anaemia  worldwide, 
affecting  over  2  billion  people,  which  equates  to  approximately  30%  of  the  world’s  population  (Pavord, 
2012;  NICE  CKS,  2013;  Zhu,  2010).  Epidemiological  surveys  indicate  that  in  Europe,  iron  depletion 
concerns 10-30% of  menstruating women with  1.5 to  14% progressing to  IDA. In pregnant women the 
prevalence  of  IDA,  according  to  different  studies  and  surveys,  ranges  from  6  to  30%  with  the  highest 
Assessment report

levels  observed  in  countries  such  as  Holland  (6-28%),  Denmark  (0-18%)  and  France  (9-30%)  where 
routine iron supplementation is not usually given during pregnancy (Hercberg, 2001). 
Typical  symptoms  of  IDA  include  chronic  fatigue,  weakness  and  tiredness  as  a  direct  result  of  altered 
energy  metabolism,  thus  leading  to  a  subtle  impairment  of  physical  capacity,  work  performance  and 
cognitive  functioning.  Clinical  features  also  comprise  those  symptoms  associated  with  central  hypoxia 
such  as  headaches,  dizziness,  vertigo,  tinnitus  or  lethargy.  Iron  deficiency  anaemia  may  also  be 
responsible  for  dyspnoea,  pica,  cognitive  impairment  such  as  short  attention  duration,  koilonychias, 
papillary atrophy of the tongue, angular stomatitis and oesophageal webs, among others.  
Iron  deficiency  is  a  common  complication  of  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD),  occurring  in  about  60-
80% of IBD patients. Approximately one-third of patients with IBD are also anaemic. Although anaemia in 
IBD  often  involves  a  combination  of  IDA  and  anaemia  of  chronic  disease,  IDA  remains  an  important 
contributor in this condition (Zhu, 2010). Importantly for the therapeutic action of Feraccru, the observed 
IDA in IBD patients does not appear to be due entirely to an inability to absorb oral iron, even in cases of 
severe chronic inflammatory disease (Erichsen, 2003; Bartels, 1978). 
On 17 December 2015 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion,  recommending  the  granting  of  a  marketing  authorisation  for  the  medicinal  product  Feraccru, 
intended  for  the  treatment  of  iron  deficiency  anaemia  in  adults  with  inflammatory  bowel  disease.  The 
Marketing  Authorisation  was  issued  on  18  February  2016  (Feraccru  30  mg  hard  gelatin  capsule;  MA 
number: EU/1/15/1075/001). 
This medicinal product is an iron replacement preparation. Its anatomical therapeutic classification (ATC) 
pharmaco-therapeutic group is iron trivalent, oral preparation; the ATC code is BO3AB10. 
It  was  developed  to  provide  an  alternative  oral  (ferric)  iron  product  for  subjects  with  iron  deficiency. 
Initial clinical development focused on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) a patient subgroup 
which is difficult to treat with standard oral (ferrous) iron preparations because of a combination of non-
compliance due to side effects and impaired absorption due to the chronic inflammatory state. 
The  initial  marketing  authorisation  was  granted  on  the  basis  of  sufficient  clinical  evidence  for  clinically 
relevant efficacy in iron deficiency anaemia patients with IBD. 
Clinical Development Programme 
A  clinical  development  programme  was  established  to  provide  pivotal  registration  data  to  support  the 
marketing authorisation approval (MAA) for Feraccru in the treatment of ID/IDA. The initial development 
focused  on  patients  with  IDA  and  IBD:  this  subgroup  of  IDA  patients  was  perceived  as  a  “worst  case” 
population as they are commonly intolerant to oral ferrous products. 
This  completed  programme  included  two  PK  studies  (a  sub-study)  and  a  pivotal  phase  III  efficacy  and 
safety  study  (conducted  as  two  separate  protocols  in  ulcerative  colitis  (UC)  and  Crohn’s  disease  (CD) 
patients respectively) that were fully compliant with GCP.  
Study ST10-01-101 was an open-label, randomised,  multiple  dose  PK study  conducted with 24 subjects 
with  iron  deficiency  (with  or  without  anaemia).  The  primary  objective  of  Study  ST10-01-101  was  to 
evaluate  the  kinetics  of  maltol  along  with  its  metabolite,  maltol  glucuronide,  as  well  as  iron  uptake  in 
blood and urine after single and repeated bid oral doses of 30 mg, 60 mg or 90 mg  Feraccru for 7 days, 
followed by a final dose on the morning of day 8. 
Study ST10-01-102 was a prospective PK sub-study of subjects receiving Feraccru 30 mg bid in the open-
label phase  of studies ST10-01-301 or ST10-01-302. The objective of ST10-01-102 was to describe the 
PK  profile  of  Feraccru  at  steady  state  after  a  30  mg  single  dose  in  the  target  patient  population,  i.e.,

patients with IDA and IBD. 
The  pivotal,  phase  3,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  with  Feraccru  for 
the treatment of IDA in subjects with IBD where OFP had failed or could not be used, was conducted via 
two separate protocols: 
• ST10-01-301 (AEGIS 1) in patients with quiescent UC 
• ST10-01-302 (AEGIS 2) in patients with quiescent CD. 
The study designs for these protocols were essentially identical except for the differing IBD population. 
Efficacy was evaluated over the first 12 weeks of randomised treatment. All completed subjects from the 
randomised  phase  received  open-label  Feraccru  for up  to  an  additional  52  weeks,  with  the  exception  of 
patients  recruited  in  Austria,  where  the  Ethics  Committee  would  not  sanction  the  52-week  extension  of 
the  study  unless  the  sponsor  agreed  to  unblind  patients  after  the  initial  12-week  placebo  period  of  the 
protocol. The sponsor was unwilling to agree to this. 
In addition, a series of clinical studies (over the last two decades) with Feraccru in healthy subjects and in 
anaemic  patients  (with  and  without  IBD),  although  not  conducted  to  current  standards  of  GCP,  has 
provided a considerable body of knowledge on the absorption, efficacy, safety and tolerability of a range 
of doses of Feraccru. 
Following  national  scientific  advice  and  agreement  that  the  analysis  of  a  single  combined  dataset  from 
both  studies  would  be  scientifically  and  statistically  valid,  the  analysis  plan  was  integrated.  In  addition, 
the dataset has been reanalysed for the primary efficacy endpoint, within each protocol dataset ([ST10-
01-301 and ST10-01-302] according  to the IBD  diagnosis).  An  interim  safety analysis of the open-label 
phase (cut-off date 31st March 2014) was performed: this has been superseded by the final study report 
(ST10-01-31/302  CSR2),  which  presents  data  for  the  double-blind,  the  full  open  label  and  cumulative 
phases of the study. 
The  MAH  also  conducted  2  in  vitro  studies  that  investigated  potential  drug-drug  interactions:  one  study 
(Cyprotex  Study  No.  CYP0747  R3)  investigated  the  effects  of  Feraccru  on  the  permeability  of  drugs 
known to interact with ferrous products, using a Caco-2 cell model to simulate intestinal absorption and 
the  second  study  (XenoGesis  Study  no.  2015_06_23,  2015)  was  conducted  to  determine  the  UGT 
isoenzyme(s) responsible for the glucuronidation of the maltol component of Feraccru. 
The MAH obtained advice on design of Phase 3 studies and clinical development from BfArM and MHRA. 
Specific questions on the acceptability of the endpoints proposed in the Phase 3 studies and the proposed 
number  of  patients  that  would  be  exposed  to  Feraccru  for  6  and  12  months  were  proposed.  Additional 
advice was sought from these agencies on the scientific and statistical validity of the analysis of a single 
combined dataset from both studies and the acceptability of filing on the basis of this single pivotal data 
set.  
Supportive evidence for the efficacy of Feraccru in patients from IDA is provided by further published and 
unpublished  studies.  Additional  supportive  data  for  Feraccru  treatment  of  ID/IDA  is  being  generated  in 
additional subpopulations, including patients with IDA and chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
The  MAH  applied  for  the  following  indication:  Feraccru  is  indicated  in  adults  for  the  treatment  of  iron 
deficiency. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH submitted a justification for not submitting any Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) studies.  
Taking  into  consideration  the  nature  of  the  active  ingredients  of  Feraccru  complex,  electrolytes  and 
carbohydrates, Feraccru is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Iron is ubiquitously 
found  throughout  the  environment  and  maltol  a  simple  sugar  and  a  dehydration  product  of  glucose. 
Therefore, although the indication is being extended for use in iron deficient anaemia, not related to any 
disease, this is not expected to pose a risk to the environmental. 
Therefore, the MAH justification for absence of Environmental Risk Assessment is accepted. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
As detailed in the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1*, 1 June 2006), vitamins and electrolytes are exempted from the 
need for a complete environmental risk assessment, as they are unlikely to result in  a significant risk to 
the  environment.  Taking  into  consideration  the  nature  of  the  active  ingredients  of  Feraccru  complex, 
electrolytes  and  carbohydrates,  Feraccru  is  unlikely  to  result  in  a  significant  risk  to  the  environment. 
Therefore, although the indication is being extended for use in iron deficient anaemia, not related to any 
disease,  this  is  not  expected  to  pose  a  risk  to  the  environment.  Further  studies  are  not  required  to 
support the claimed indication. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted with this new application which is considered acceptable.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
No new clinical study data have been submitted in this application. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant; the pivotal PK 
studies (ST10-01-101 and ST10-01-102) were conducted in accordance with GCP, as were the pivotal 
clinical efficacy and safety studies (ST10-01-301 and ST10-01-302). 
Early supportive PK studies (Thompson & Hider, Studies 1, 2, 3 & 4, Maxton et al [1994], Reffitt et al 
[2000], MacPhail [2012], Murray et al, Kelsey et al [1991], were not conducted in accordance with GCP. 
Similarly, the supportive clinical studies Blake & Kelsey, Green & Thompson [1995], Harvey et al [1998] 
and SWIN-189-IM were not conducted in accordance with GCP. 
The in vitro studies conducted to investigate potential drug-drug interactions were not conducted in 
accordance with full GLP, as this is not required by current regulations.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new clinical PK-study data were submitted with this application. 
The clinical development program included two prospective PK studies (one of them is a sub-study) that 
were compliant with GCP. 
ST10-01-101 study: open-label, randomised, single and repeat-dose, parallel group study 
The first PK study (ST10-01-101) was an open-label, randomised, single and repeat-dose, parallel group 
study conducted with 24 subjects with iron deficiency (with or without anaemia) but no chronic 
inflammatory disease at three dosage levels to evaluate the kinetics of maltol, maltol glucuronide and the 
iron uptake.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018

The primary objective of Study ST10-01-101 was to evaluate the PK and iron uptake of Feraccru in blood 
and urine after single and repeated bid oral doses of 30 mg, 60 mg or 90 mg Feraccru for 7 days followed 
by a final dose on the morning of day 8 through measurement of serum concentrations of total iron, 
serum values of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and plasma and urine concentrations of maltol and maltol 
glucuronide. 
Maximum serum iron concentrations occurred between 2 and 3 hours post-dose, reaching mean±SD 
serum concentrations of 32.3±9.04, 49.1±19.3 and 48.7±15.8 μmol/L for the 30, 60 and 90 mg dosing 
regimens, respectively on Day 1. Mean serum concentrations subsequently declined, and at 6 hours post-
dose were 11.8±8.93, 33.0±16.3 and 24.3±19.5 μmol/L above baseline for the 30, 60 and 90 mg dosing 
regimens, respectively on Day 1. Comparable concentrations were attained on Day 8.  
Total serum iron concentration values were generally higher with increasing Ferric maltol dose, with 
maximum values between 2 and 3 hours post-dose, and then declined gradually after 3 hours on Day 1 
and were comparable on Day 8. 
Mean TIBC, transferrin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations remained relatively constant 
throughout PK sampling, and were comparable between dosing regimens, and between Day 1 and Day 8. 
Ferritin concentrations remained relatively constant throughout PK sampling, although higher mean 
values were recorded on Day 8 compared to Day 1 for all dosing regimens. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of single and repeated bid oral doses of 
30 mg, 60 mg or 90 mg Feraccru for 7 days followed by a final dose on the morning of day 8 on serum 
values of NTBI, serum concentrations of transferrin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin and soluble 
transferrin receptor, routine haematology indices and reticulocyte haemoglobin (CHr) concentrations in 
whole blood. 
ST10-01-102 study: PK sub-study of the pivotal clinical efficacy/safety study 
The second study (ST10-01-102) was a PK sub-study of the pivotal clinical efficacy/safety study, where 
subjects received Ferric maltol 30 mg bid in the open-label phase (of study ST10-01-301 /302) to 
describe the PK profile at steady state after a 30 mg single dose in patients with iron deficiency anaemia 
(IDA) and IBD.  
The objective of Feraccru-01-102 was to describe the PK profile of Feraccru after a 30 mg single dose 
administered at steady-state in the morning through measurement of serum iron parameters (transferrin, 
TSAT, TIBC, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, total serum iron), plus plasma and urine concentrations 
of maltol and maltol glucuronide, following at least 7 days treatment in the open-label phase of studies 
ST10-01-301 or ST10-01-302. 
Secondary objectives were measurement of NTBI as a marker of Feraccru in serum after a 30 mg single 
dose administered at steady-state, following at least 7 days treatment in the open-label phase of studies 
ST10-01-301 or ST10-01-302. 
Serum total iron concentrations reached a maximum between 1 and 2 hours post-dose. The mean 
maximum serum iron concentration was 21.9 μmol/L. Serum total iron concentrations gradually declined 
from Cmax, and appeared to have returned to baseline levels at 8 hours post-dose. From plots comparing 
total iron and the exposure to maltol or maltol glucuronide, no relationship was observed between them.  
Serum values for TIBC and concentrations of transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor and ferritin 
remained constant throughout the 8-hour sampling period. Total serum iron concentrations, TSAT values 
and Hb concentrations in this sub-study were consistent with Ferric maltol dosing improving iron 
deficiency anaemia in these subjects.

Feraccru Dissociation 
Feraccru is a chelated form of iron with a very strong bond. Maltol is able to hold the ferric iron in a 
soluble form at the pH encountered in the intestinal lumen i.e., up to pH 8.0. However, the ferric ion in 
Feraccru is readily available for ligand exchange with biomolecules, provided those molecules have a 
similar or greater binding affinity for the ferric ion, thereby avoiding the problems of low bioavailability 
observed with other ferric products. This process of direct ligand exchange with oxo binding sites on 
transferrin at the enterocyte wall is the key feature contributing to the safety and efficacy of Feraccru. 
Preclinical data in the rat demonstrated that there was no difference in 59Fe absorption from ferric 
trimaltol given by tube into the stomach compared to 59Fe uptake from ferric maltol injected directly into 
the duodenum (Barrand 1987), indicating its stability in the stomach. This is supported by the clinical 
sub-group analysis showing that patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) had no difference in Hb 
rise compared to those not taking PPIs in ST10-01-301/2. 
The exact location of the dissolution of the ferric iron-maltol-complex contained in Feraccru has not been 
unequivocally identified. Studies do however indicate that it dissociates either at the epithelial cell 
membrane or within the endothelial cell itself as intact Feraccru does not enter the systemic circulation. 
In the two pivotal PK studies (ST10-01-101 and ST10-01-102), the profiles of total serum iron 
concentration and TSAT did not match those for maltol or maltol glucuronide. Consequently, no clear 
relationship could be discerned between either total serum iron concentration or TSAT and exposure to 
maltol or maltol glucuronide. These observations are consistent with non-clinical studies in which ferric 
maltol complexes were shown to dissociate at the surface of, or within the enterocyte (Barrand 1991a; 
Barrand 1991b). 
Complete dissociation of iron and maltol is confirmed by the PK studies and is consistent with the absence 
of Feraccru in blood; Feraccru does not appear in urine. In study ST10-01-102, a single NTBI value ≥0.2 
eLPI units (threshold for a positive result) was determined. However, upon routine retesting, for quality 
control reasons, this value was 0.0 eLPI units, indicating no ‘free’ serum iron. 
In study ST10-01-101, consistent with the previous PK sub-study, NTBI values ≥0.2 eLPI units were rare 
with the 30 mg dosing regimen. Of the four samples for which ≥0.2 eLPI units were determined, one was 
taken pre-dose on Day 1 of the study. As all subjects were iron deficient at study entry, and iron 
preparations were prohibited prior to the study (7 days for oral and 28 days for parenteral iron 
preparations), the single pre-dose NTBI value ≥0.2 eLPI units suggests that ‘positive’ NTBI values may 
be determined in the absence of any obvious source of excess iron. Mean NTBI values were higher in the 
60 and 90 mg dosing regimens. Feraccru increased maltol glucuronide levels dose proportionally. Several 
studies have shown that significant levels of NTBI are produced when oral ferrous preparations are given 
with food (Dresow, 2008; Hutchinson, 2004). 
Although patient numbers were low and the studies were not conducted in accordance with GCP, clinical 
investigations performed at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, provided some useful preliminary PK data on 
Feraccru and the results were largely consistent with the pivotal, GCP-compliant PK studies (ST10-01-101 
and ST10-01-102). 
In the first of these studies the systemic uptake and excretion of iron and maltol was investigated in two 
healthy male subjects after administration of 10 mg Feraccru radiolabelled with 59Fe and 3H. All 59Fe-
associated radioactivity was associated with the high molecular weight protein fractions of the blood. 
Nearly all 3H radioactivity was associated with the low molecular weight plasma protein fraction. In the 
two males, 82% and 71%, respectively, of the maltol dose was eliminated in the urine, primarily (95%) 
as glucuronide conjugate. No Feraccru, maltol or iron was detected in the urine of either subject 
(Thompson & Hider, Study 2, Data on File).

In a second study, the PK of high-dose ferric 3H-tri-maltol was assessed in one healthy male volunteer. 
The subject was dosed with 5.65 g of ferric 3H-tri-maltol (approximately 72 mg/kg), which was 
equivalent to 706 mg of iron and 4.94 g of maltol. Only 0.6% of the iron dose (equivalent to 5 mg iron) 
was absorbed; in contrast, 55% of the maltol dose was absorbed. Based on the amounts of absorbed iron 
and maltol, there was no evidence that Feraccru was absorbed as an intact molecule (Thompson & Hider, 
Study 3). 
A further study investigated the PK of maltol following single-dose oral administration of 800 mg Feraccru 
(equivalent to 100 mg iron and 700 mg maltol) to three healthy male volunteers. Blood samples were 
obtained pre-dose and at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360 and 480 minutes post-dose. In this 
study, maltol itself was not detected in the systemic circulation, suggesting that following absorption, 
maltol undergoes rapid and complete first pass metabolism and is bio-transformed to maltol-glucuronide. 
No Feraccru, maltol or iron were found in the urine in this study (Thompson & Hider, Study 4). 
Absorption 
The absorption of iron from Ferric maltol has been evaluated in several clinical pharmacology studies 
(GCP non-compliant and GCP-compliant studies) in healthy subjects and patients. 
The human body carefully regulates absorption of iron from the gut. Because there is no active excretory 
process for iron once it has entered the bloodstream, the body’s control of iron levels is undertaken at the 
level of the enterocyte (Geisser, 2011). A therapeutic dose of oral iron is taken up by active absorption. 
The exact mechanism of absorption of ferric iron from the gut however, is still the subject of scientific 
debate. There are several potential pathways: one involves the reduction of ferric to the ferrous form at 
the epithelium surface and subsequent uptake by a divalent metal transporter (DMT-1); an alternative 
mechanism is direct uptake of chelated ferric iron by ligand exchange mediated by the β3 integrin 
pathway (Conrad & Umbreit 2000). Feraccru does not to inhibit zinc uptake, indicating that iron from 
Feraccru does not enter the cell via the nonspecific DMT-1 pathway, which would require reduction to 
Fe2+. Because maltol holds iron firmly in the ferric form and acts as an anti-oxidant then the mechanism 
for iron uptake from Feraccru is likely to be via non-reductive ligand exchange (Ahmet 1998). Uptake of 
the iron from ferric trimaltol onto a high affinity binding protein in the duodenal enterocyte was shown in 
nonclinical study in the small intestine of the rat (Barrand & Callingham 1991) and the uptake was 
saturable. These findings were consistent with the observations of Teichmann & Stremmel (Teichmann & 
Stremmel 1990) who observed, using human microvillous membrane vesicles that ferric ions could be 
taken up by a vesicular pathway as a facilitated but saturable mechanism involving a membrane bound 
high affinity binding protein. 
Under normal circumstances, transferrin in blood is approximately one third saturated. However, when 
iron is available in excess, transferrin becomes saturated and NTBI circulates in the plasma and is taken 
up via an unregulated mechanism by endocrine and heart cells, resulting in oxidative stress reactions 
within these tissues. 
The absorption of iron from Feraccru has been evaluated in several clinical pharmacology studies in 
healthy subjects and patients with ID. Iron absorption from Feraccru was investigated in 21 iron deficient 
patients in a three-stage sequential study (Kelsey, 1991). In this study, absorption from Feraccru was 
compared to equivalent doses of ferrous sulphate; two different formulations (aqueous solution and 
tablets) and two dose levels (10 mg and 60 mg) were also examined. In this study, iron absorption was 
similar from Feraccru or ferrous sulphate when administered to iron deficient patients in either form.  
For the 10 mg dose, the results are presented in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 14/58 
 
  
  
For the 60 mg dose, the results are presented in the following table: 
Following a 10 mg dose of oral iron, as either ferric maltol or ferrous sulphate in liquid or tablet form, 
maximal rise in serum iron was seen at 1 hour post-test dose in 50% cases. In the other cases the 2-h 
level was only marginally higher than that seen at 1 hour indicating considerable plateau of the 
absorption curve by this time. 
A similar plateau after 1 h was seen with the higher dose 60 mg tablets. Proportionate increases in serum 
iron were also observed in patients receiving the 60 mg doses. For the patients who received Ferric 
maltol, serum iron increased by approximately 56 μmol/l (equivalent to 14% of the administered dose), 
to a mean serum iron concentration after dosing of 62 ±27 μmol/l. Patients who took ferrous sulphate 
experienced a serum iron increase of approximately 41 μmol/l (equivalent to 10% of the administered 
dose), to a mean serum iron concentration after dosing of 47 ± 4 μmol/l. 
There is no statistically significant difference between the results obtained for the two preparations (P > 
0·4, unpaired I-test). 
A further study compared the absorption of iron from an enteric-coated capsule formulation versus liquid 
formulations of Feraccru and ferrous sulphate in a total of 41 iron deficient patients, patients with 
polycythaemia and iron replete controls. Each patient took both Feraccru and ferrous sulphate containing 
the equivalent of 10 mg iron labelled with 59Fe (2μCi) as acid-resistant capsules, in chicken soup or milk 
and as an aqueous solution in water adjusted to pH 7. Mean absorption in iron deficient patients was 
greater than in normal patients for both Feraccru and ferrous sulphate. Rates of iron absorption were 
comparable from Feraccru or ferrous sulphate in patients regardless of method of delivery. The authors 
noted that Feraccru is much less likely than ferrous sulphate to cause side effects; indeed, one volunteer 
took 360 mg and 720 mg doses of iron as ferric maltol without side effects (Maxton, 1994). It could 
therefore be concluded that iron was absorbed from Feraccru at least as well as iron from ferrous 
sulphate. The systemic uptake and excretion of iron was investigated in 9 healthy subjects following 
single dose oral administration of enteric-coated capsules containing 59Fe radiolabelled ST10-021 
(Thompson & Hider, Study 1). The percentage absorption of 59Fe 7 days after the oral dose in 9 normal 
subjects was approximately 15% of the oral dose given. These values are significantly different (p <0.05) 
but are based on a small number of observations. 
A further study reported on the PK of high-dose ferric 3H-tri-maltol in one healthy male volunteer. The 
subject was dosed with 5.65 g of ferric 3H-tri-maltol (approximately 72 mg/kg), which was equivalent to 
706 mg of iron and 4.94 g of maltol (63 times the acceptable daily intake of maltol as a food supplement 
and 10 times higher than the daily dose of maltol administered in Feraccru capsules). The amount of 
maltol absorbed from Feraccru at a high dose of 72 mg/kg was <1/10th of the NOEL in completed non-
clinical toxicology studies, where maltol was virtually completely absorbed (Thompson & Hider, Study 3).

Distribution 
In study ST10-01-101 the PK profiles of both maltol and maltol glucuronide were comparable between 
Day 1 and Day 8. Although some C0h values for maltol glucuronide were above quantifiable limits on Day 
8 in all dosing groups, the Day 8/Day 1 ratios for Cmax and AUC0-t indicated that there was no 
significant accumulation of maltol or its metabolite, maltol glucuronide, with any of the Feraccru dosing 
regimens investigated. In addition, exposure to maltol glucuronide was approximately dose proportional 
on both Day 1 and Day 8 in this study. 
The PK of maltol is linear and predictable after Feraccru dosing with 30, 60 or 90 mg bid regimens. In 
man, iron from Feraccru is utilised and distributed in a physiological manner since the iron rapidly 
exchanges onto the transport and storage proteins in the body. Since iron is absorbed using the well-
defined physiological iron uptake and storage mechanisms, no tissue distribution studies were considered 
necessary. 
Elimination 
In study ST10-01-102, exposure to maltol glucuronide was considerably higher than exposure to maltol, 
and only 0.266% of the maltol dose administered was excreted unchanged in the urine, compared to an 
equivalent of 41.6% as maltol glucuronide.  
Although the liver is the major site of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase expression (Ohno, 2009), a non-
clinical study using radiolabelled ferric maltol complex indicated that maltol is also extensively 
glucuronidated at the site of absorption in the intestinal mucosa (Barrand, 1991b). 
In study ST10-01-101, as in the prior PK sub-study (ST10-01-102), the profiles of maltol and maltol 
glucuronide were similar, although exposure to maltol glucuronide was considerably higher compared to 
maltol and most of the ingested maltol dose was excreted as maltol glucuronide in the urine. Maltol was 
rapidly glucuronidated after Feraccru dosing, before being renally excreted. 
The same conclusions as above were drawn from the published and unpublished studies in healthy 
volunteers and subjects with ID conducted by Thompson & Hider Study 2, and Thompson & Hider, Study 
4. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In study ST-1001-101, dose-normalised parameter for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ were graphically 
displayed for maltol and maltol glucuronide as function of the dose, to explore dose-proportionality. 
Dose-normalised parameter plots for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ were consistent with dose-proportional 
increases in maltol exposure across the 30 mg to 90 mg bid dosing range, although for Subject 101-101-
005 in the 60 mg dosing regimen Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ were considerably higher on both days. 
These values had a considerable impact on the corresponding mean values for this group. Mean values 
for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ increased with higher doses. Dose-normalised PK parameter plots for 
maltol glucuronide indicate that exposure to maltol glucuronide was dose proportional across the 30 to 90 
mg bid dose range.

Gender 
There were twice as many women as men who participated in studies ST10-01-101 and ST10-01-102, 
however, subjects were generally well matched across treatment sequences for demographic 
characteristics including gender. No gender specific PK data on Ferric maltol were noted. 
Race 
All participants in studies ST10-01-101 and ST10-01-102 were white and mainly Caucasian. 
Elderly 
There are limited PK data on Ferric maltol in the elderly; the oldest subject in either of the prospective 
GCP-compliant studies was 57 years old. In a single-dose pilot study, iron absorption from Ferric maltol 
(administered as a 10 mg iron dose in aqueous solution) was investigated in three elderly patients with 
anaemia and three elderly healthy subjects (Murray, Blake & Kelsey). 
Children 
No children specific PK studies on Ferric maltol were performed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new clinical studies were performed. 
All  available  evidence  from  both  nonclinical  and  clinical  data  on  the  absorption  from  the  GI  tract,  on 
transport, storage and excretion of iron and maltol after oral administration of Feraccru strongly indicate, 
that  the  ST10  complex  does  not  appear  in  systemic  circulation  but  dissociates  completely  to  ferric  iron 
and maltol. The iron active moiety that is released from Feraccru in the proximal duodenum and delivered 
to  the  intestinal  enterocytes  is  a  well-established  physiological  substance  and,  therefore,  no  specific 
studies  have  been  conducted  to  assess  the  PD  effects  of  Feraccru  or  ferric  iron.  Iron  is  an  essential 
micronutrient  that  is  required  for  adequate  erythropoietic  function,  oxidative  metabolism  and  cellular 
immune  responses.  Iron  deficiency  and  iron  deficiency  anaemia  are  caused  by  low  levels  of  iron  in  the 
body. The most common reasons for ID are insufficient iron intake in the diet, an inability to  absorb iron 
well in the body and/or loss of iron in blood through bleeding. The pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments of 
iron  preparations  cannot  be  based  on  the  standard  principles  that  apply  to  non-endogenous  drugs.  The 
published data discussed above and the pivotal PK studies confirm that iron is absorbed from Feraccru.  
Mechanism of action 
The iron in Ferric maltol is unable to bind to maltol and transferrin simultaneously. Intracellularly ferric 
trimaltol can rapidly exchange its iron onto high affinity binding proteins, with the same elution profiles as 
ferritin and transferrin (Barrand et al 1987). The iron from ferric trimaltol would require a specific active 
mechanism since its molecular size (M Wt 470) would preclude direct absorption through tight channels. 
Uptake of the iron from ferric trimaltol onto a high affinity binding protein in the duodenal enterocyte was 
shown in non-clinical study in the small intestine of the rat (Barrand & Callingham 1991) and the uptake 
was saturable. These findings were consistent with the observations of Teichmann & Stremmel 1990 who 
observed, using human microvillous membrane vesicles that ferric ions could be taken up by a vesicular 
pathway as a facilitated but saturable mechanism involving a membrane bound high affinity binding 
protein.

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Secondary Pharmacological Effects 
Administration of Feraccru has not resulted in any secondary pharmacological effects to date. 
Pharmacodynamic Interactions 
No pharmacokinetic drug interactions studies were submitted either during the initial procedure or in this 
procedure.  
Plasma Concentration-effect Relationship 
The absorption of iron from Feraccru or other iron supplements can vary widely depending on the severity 
of anaemia and/or the level of iron deficiency. Oral iron uptake is regulated to enhance absorption when 
the body is iron deficient, and to minimise absorption in the iron-replete state. The processes governing 
iron uptake are highly complex and include controlling uptake from the GI tract, transfer of iron to the 
systemic circulation and receptor-mediated progenitor cell absorption of iron. An anaemic subject will 
absorb more iron than a healthy subject and absorption will increase with the level of deficiency. Under 
normal circumstances there is a maximal level to iron absorption from the gut, and within PK study ST10-
01-101 it was demonstrated that a dose of 90 mg bid of Feraccru (i.e., three times the proposed daily 
dose) did not result in dose-proportional iron absorption and the amount absorbed from such a dose was 
less than three times what was observed with 30 mg bid. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No formal population pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with Feraccru however the 
pharmacokinetic sub-study (ST10-01-102) conducted in a sub-set of patients participating in the open 
label phase of the pivotal phase 3 studies provides robust data on the PK of Feraccru in the intended 
patient population. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK  data  submitted  by  the  applicant  are  the  same  information  as  in  the  initial  procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/002733/0000).  It  was  based  on  several  studies  published  since  the  90’s  and  two  studies 
conducted in patients with ID of any cause with or without  anaemia (ST10-01-101) and in patients with 
IBD (ST10-01-102). 
The  ferric  trimaltol  absorption  occurs  to  a  far  lesser  degree  in  iron  replete  subjects,  implying  that  this 
compound  is  subject  to  the  normal  regulatory  mechanisms  controlling  gastrointestinal  iron  absorption. 
Taking  into  account  all  the  information  provided  it  seems  that  the  absorption  of  Feraccru  could  be 
considered pretty similar in iron deficient and IBD subjects. 
Regarding metabolism there are studies in healthy volunteers and subjects with IDA showed that maltol 
itself was not detected in the systemic circulation, suggesting that following absorption, maltol undergoes 
rapid  and  complete  first  pass  metabolism  and  is  bio-transformed  to  maltol-glucuronide.  Lately,  both  PK 
studies (ST10-01-101 and ST10-01-102) confirmed these data. 
The pharmacokinetic properties of Feraccru was assessed through measurement of plasma and urine 
concentrations of maltol and maltol glucuronide, together with serum iron parameters after a single dose 
and at steady state (after 1 week) in 24 subjects with iron deficiency, randomised to receive 30 mg, 
60 mg or 90 mg Feraccru twice daily. Blood and urine samples were assayed for maltol and maltol 
glucuronide. Serum samples were assayed for iron parameters.

Maltol was transiently measured in plasma with a  AUC0-t between 0.022 and 0.205 h.µg/mL across all 
dosing regimens and both study days. Non-clinical studies have shown that maltol is metabolised through 
UGT1A6 and by sulphation. It is not known if medical products that inhibit UGT enzymes have the 
potential to increase maltol concentration (see section 4.5). The maltol appeared to be rapidly 
metabolised to maltol glucuronide ( AUC0-t between 9.83 and 30.9 h.µg/mL across all dosage regimens). 
Maximum maltol and maltol glucuronide concentrations were reached 1 to 1.5 hours after oral 
administration of Feraccru. Exposure to maltol glucuronide increased dose proportionally over the 
Feraccru 30 to 90 mg twice daily dosing range and there was no significant accumulation of either after 7 
days treatment with Feraccru. Of the total maltol ingested, a mean of between 39.8 % and 60.0 % was 
excreted as maltol glucuronide. Peak transferrin saturation (TSAT) and total serum iron values were 
reached 1.5 to 3 hours after oral administration of Feraccru. Total serum iron concentrations and TSAT 
values were generally higher with increasing Feraccru doses. TSAT and total serum iron profiles were 
comparable between Day 1 and Day 8.   
The pharmacokinetic properties of Feraccru were also investigated at steady state in 15 subjects who 
were already participating in the AEGIS1/2 study described above and who had been in the open-label 
treatment phase for at least 7 days (Feraccru 30 mg twice daily). Maltol was again transiently measured 
in plasma with a half-life of 0.7 hours, with a Cmax of 67.3 + 28.3 ng/mL. The maltol appeared to be 
rapidly metabolised to maltol glucuronide (Cmax = 4677 + 1613 ng/mL). Maximum maltol and maltol 
glucuronide concentrations were reached approximately 1 hour after oral administration of Feraccru. 
Maximum total iron serum concentrations were measured 1-2 hours after administration. The 
pharmacokinetic profiles of maltol/maltol glucuronide and iron parameters were independent of one 
another.   
Considering that there are several circumstances that affect iron absorption, mainly etiology and severity 
of iron deficiency, bioavailability has been shown sufficiently even in iron deficiency patients without 
anemia. With the data provided, although they are scarce, it is considered that absorption and as a result 
efficacy in patients with ID without anaemia is sufficiently demonstrated. 
Feraccru, as a new complex of an existing substance that differs in safety and efficacy to those existing 
substances, it can be considered to be a new chemical entity, the iron that is released and delivered to 
the intestinal enterocytes is a known active ingredient with well-established PD drug interactions.  
No  pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions  studies  were  submitted  during  the  initial  procedure  and  in  this 
procedure.  Conclusions  at  the  end  of  the initial  procedure  were  that  the  applicant  must  perform  drug  – 
drug  interaction  studies  and  this  was  included  in  the  RMP  as  an  important  potential  risk.  In  December 
2016  the  Applicant  submitted  a  variation  (II/0002/G)  of  two  final  study  reports  for  in  vitro  studies 
conducted  as  part  of  post-authorisation  measures  MEA  001  and  MEA  002.  This  procedure  included  one 
DDI  study  to  investigate  drug  interactions  with  Feraccru  and  another  DDI  study  to  identify  UGT 
isoenzyme(s)  that  are  responsible  for  metabolism  of  ferric  maltol.  As  a  consequence,  the  SmPC  was 
revised accordingly. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Taking  into  account  all  the  PK/PD  data  provided  it  seems  that  Feraccru  could  work  similarly  in  IBD 
patients and in healthy subjects.  
There are also some data coming from non-GCP studies which are in line with PK study in relation to 
serum iron levels increment.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
No new clinical study data were submitted with this variation. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Justification of dose 
The dose of Feraccru investigated in the clinical programme was 30 mg bid, i.e., 60 mg/day of iron. 
Early clinical studies suggested that 60 mg/day (iron) of Feraccru is sufficient to correct iron deficiency in 
patients with IDA and ferrous sulphate intolerance (Harvey, 1998). Furthermore, a profile of Feraccru 
dose versus effective absorption at differing Hb levels has been demonstrated (Powell, 2011). The dose 
was derived from a model developed to determine the optimal dose. 
The model used data from 6 previous studies of Feraccru in subjects with IBD and IDA to estimate 
absorption rates in the study population. This confirmed that a dose of 60 mg per day was optimal and 
would normalise Hb levels in nearly 100% of iron deficient males and 80% of iron deficient females after 
12 weeks of treatment. This amount was given as two divided doses to minimise any potential GI-related 
side effects as would be commonly seen with OFPs. 
In study ST10-01-101, maximum values of both total serum iron concentration and TSAT occurred 
between 1.5 and 3 hours post dose. Values for both parameters were consistent between Day 1 and Day 
8 and, higher values were recorded for the 60 and 90 mg dosing regimens compared to the 30 mg 
regimen.  
The pivotal phase 3 study demonstrated that 30 mg bid was highly effective in treating IDA in IBD 
patients (ST10-01-301/302) by normalising both ferritin and Hb levels. There is no scientific rationale for 
arguing that this dose would not be effective in other diseases associated with IDA, such as women with 
heavy menstrual bleeding or patients with CKD, given that patients with IBD theoretically might have had 
impaired uptake of oral iron due to inflammation of the GI tract and can therefore be considered a “worst 
case” population. 
The approved dose is the one valid for IBD patients. During the initial procedure it was observed that 60 
mg bid could be more effective than 30 mg bid dose. However, taking into account the tolerability 30 mg 
bid was selected as the appropriate dose for IDA in patients with IBD. The Applicant stated that there is 
not argument against that this dose could be effective in other diseases associated with ID.  
PK-data show sufficient bioavailability in study- subjects with iron deficiency without anaemia and 
supportive clinical study data indicate that the recommended dose is sufficient to normalise iron blood 
indices in patients with ID/IDA or maintain Hb –levels in patients with active blood loss. Data from PK 
study (ST10-01-101) showed that although doses higher than 30 mg attained better efficacy the safety 
profile was worse. Moreover, taking into account PK parameters, there were no much differences between 
30 mg and the other two doses explored. 
The efficacy of the active component iron can be considered ‘well established’ after resorption has taken 
place (it was agreed during the MA assessment that the active is not absorbed as a whole but only as two 
separate components Iron and Trimaltol).  
The low dosage of 60 mg of iron per day in Feraccru is also covered by several authorised OFPs and can 
therefore be considered well established as well. 
Therefore, 30 mg bid is considered an acceptable dose for patients with ID.

2.4.2.  Main studies 
Evidence  for  the  efficacy  of  Feraccru  in  increasing  both  Hb  and  ferritin  levels  was  generated  from  one 
pivotal phase 3 study (ST10-01-301/302) conducted under two separate clinical protocols, one published 
study  (Harvey,  1998)  and  two  unpublished  studies  (Blake  &  Kelsey,  Data  on  File;  Green  &  Thompson, 
Data on File). 
The  approach  of  providing  data  from  a  single  pivotal  study  is  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  Guidance: 
Points  to  Consider on  Application  with  1.  Meta-analysis;  2.  One  pivotal  study  (CHMP/EWP/2330/99),  on 
the basis of:  
• Internal validity – there is no indication of bias 
•  External  validity  –  the  study  population  is  suitable  for  extrapolation  to  the  initial  population  for  the 
marketed product (patients with IDA and IBD) and for the proposed population (patients with ID) 
•  The  estimated  size  of  treatment  effect  is  considerably  greater  than  the  minimally  clinically  relevant 
effect (rise in Hb of 2.25 g/dL observed compared to a rise of 1.0 g/Dl which was prospectively identified 
as being clinically significant) 
• The statistical evidence is considerably stronger than the p<0.05 usually required, being p<0.0001 for 
the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints  
•  Internal  consistency  –  there  is  no  evidence  of  pre-specified  sub-populations  having  an  effect  on 
response rate (CD and UC sub-populations) 
• There are minimal country or centre effects 
• The hypothesis tested is plausible. 
A  post-hoc  analysis  was  provided  as  part  of  the  procedure.  The  results  of  this  confirmed  that  the  data 
from the two separate protocols was independently statistically significant for the primary endpoint. The 
two  studies  were  comparable  in  design,  execution,  key  subject  characteristics  and  outcomes.  The  two 
sets of subjects from each study were similar enough to enable analysis as a single dataset, and not to 
miss relevant differences in efficacy or safety measures. 
Extrapolation of Efficacy to Patients with ID/IDA not Associated with IBD 
Although the Phase 3 studies were conducted in patients with IDA and IBD, efficacy can be extrapolated 
to IDA associated with other disease states.  
The pivotal PK study (ST10-01-101) was conducted in patients with iron deficiency, not restricted to IBD 
and is relevant for patients with IDA caused by other factors. Iron homeostasis is regulated at the level of 
iron uptake by body iron stores, although the exact mechanism is not completely understood. There are 
no  available  data  that  indicate  that  the  distribution  and  utilisation  of  iron  differ  substantially  between 
subgroups of patients with IDA. Patients with IBD do not always respond adequately to oral iron therapy, 
because  of  a  combination  of  non-compliance  due  to  side  effects  and  impaired  absorption  due  to  IBD 
inflammation.  This  population  can  therefore  be  considered  a  worst  case  in  terms  of  both  efficacy  and 
safety.  The  Phase  3  studies  show  that  Feraccru  is  effective  in  this  population  and  it  is  possible  to 
extrapolate the effectiveness to other sub-population of patients with IDA. 
Pivotal Phase 3 Study 
The primary objective of studies ST10-01-301 and ST10-01-302 was to demonstrate the efficacy effect of 
oral Feraccru over placebo in the treatment of IDA, as measured by change in Hb concentration from 
Baseline to Week 12. Following 12 weeks of randomised treatment, all subjects received open-label 
Assessment report

treatment with feraccru for up to an additional 52 weeks with the exception of those patients in Austria 
where the Ethics Committee did not approve the open label phase of the trial. At the request of the 
MHRA, protocol wording referring to the chapter “Dose Selection and Treatment Duration” of the open 
label phase of the study was amended and the reference to a possible expansion of treatment duration 
until an access program to collect long-term safety information on Feraccru has been established was 
removed. This change was implemented globally in the next version of the Protocol (Version 3.0), at 
which point the UK protocol was again harmonised with the general protocol. 
Placebo was chosen as the comparator as treatment with OFPs would be expected to lead to a high rate 
of intolerance and discontinuation which would then result in an incomplete and reduced comparator 
dataset for safety and efficacy. Moreover, use of second line treatments with ‘improved preparations’, 
such as lower doses and delayed release or gastroprotective forms of oral iron was considered 
inappropriate. These treatments have not become widely used as there appears to be little safety or 
tolerability benefit from these compared to standard ferrous sulphate (Tolkien 2015). The current ECCO 
guidelines on IDA management in IBD (Dignass 2015) do not recommend use of ‘improved preparations’, 
and only recommend ferrous sulphate for mild anaemia in patients with inactive disease. This further 
supported the use of the placebo control arm in the pivotal studies, instead of a repeat exposure to 
ferrous products. Patients had to be 18 years of age or above and have a current diagnosis of IBD and 
IDA [either quiescent UC (SCCAI score of <4) or quiescent CD (CDAI score of <220)], anaemia (Hb ≥9.5 
g/dL and <12.0 g/dL [5.9 to 7.5 mmol/L] for females and ≥9.5 g/dL and <13.0 g/dL [5.9 to 8.1 mmol/L] 
for males), iron deficiency (ferritin <30 μg/L) and past failure of OFP and documented reasons why OFP 
could not be given. This defined patient population was consistent with the target population for the 
proposed indication. Screening laboratory values were used for inclusion into the study, whereas baseline 
values were taken at the randomisation visit. Therefore, values could have changed in the 14 days 
following screening. This is a practical issue for any study relying on the precision and standardisation of 
a central laboratory. All patients fulfilled the definition of IDA at screening. 
The SCCAI and CDAI scoring tools are commonly used to provide a measure of disease activity and were 
used to identify patients with IDA and UC. As the clinical outcome and efficacy analysis did not use either 
of these two scales, these measures were not formally validated as the results had no impact on the 
primary efficacy endpoint or the validity of data supporting the use of Feraccru in the treatment of 
anaemia. 
The definition of intolerance to OFPs used in the conduct of these studies was past failure of OFP (adverse 
drug effects that led to withdrawal from OFP by at least one of the following conditions: nausea, 
diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, and/or deterioration of the primary disease caused by 
OFP, and/or lack of efficacy, and/or other signs of failure to OFP, or reasons why OFP cannot be used as 
documented by the Investigator). 
Common prior OFPs used by at least 10% of subjects included ferrous glycine sulphate in 26 (40.6%) 
Feraccru and 25 (39.1%) placebo subjects, and ferrous sulphate in 20 (31.3%) Feraccru and 13 (20.3%) 
placebo subjects. There were some differences in the mean and median length of treatment with prior 
OFPs between the groups. The mean length of time was lower in the Feraccru group (mean 97.29 days) 
compared to the placebo group (mean 124.69 days), however the median length was longer in the 
Feraccru group than the placebo group (53.27 versus 45.66 days). Mean and median time since last dose 
of prior OFP was slightly longer in the Feraccru group (mean 36.17, median 21.82 days) than the placebo 
group (mean 33.34, median 17.35 days) (Table 2). These differences are not considered to have affected 
the results of the study.

Table 2: Previous Oral Iron Therapy for Each Subject on Studies ST10-01-301 and 302 
A post-hoc survey of the clinical trial sites was conducted and responses received from 13 German and 
Hungarian sites. The percentage of subjects at each site who had received IV iron previously ranged from 
100% to 11% with a mean of 55%. The average number of days since last IV iron treatment was 285 
(range 84-567). 
Across both treatment groups, subjects were well matched for age, race, ethnicity and height. 
Almost twice the number of females compared to males participated in the study. The proportion of males 
was slightly higher in the Feraccru group i.e., 24 (37.5%) compared to 21 (32.8%) in the placebo group, 
but there is no reason to suppose that this would have any impact on the results of the study. 
The only medical history recorded in at least 10% of subjects in either treatment group was intestinal 
resection in the Feraccru group (7 subjects, 10.9%). Other than presence of CD and UC, the 
unremarkable medical history profile was consistent with expectations for the study population as a 
whole. Median duration of IBD disease was similar in both groups. 
Fewer than 10% of subjects in both groups were taking oral supplemental vitamin B12 or folic acid. All 
subjects, with the exception of one were on stable dosing of their supplement from 3 months before 
randomisation through study Week 12.

The sample size calculation was based on results from previous exploratory studies. A sample size of 49 
subjects in each group would have 95% power to detect a probability of 0.711 P (X<Y) that an 
observation in the control group (placebo) would show a lower increase of Hb concentration than in the 
test group (Feraccru) using the Wilcoxon (Mann- Whitney) rank-sum test with a 0.025 one-sided 
significance level. To allow for non-evaluable subjects (e.g., dropouts), a total of 120 subjects were to be 
recruited, approximately 60 subjects within each study. 
The sample size was confirmed in the scientific advice meetings as acceptable provided the drop-out rate 
was low. A total of 128 subjects were randomised into both studies ST10-01-301 and ST10-01-302. 
Three hundred and twenty nine subjects were screened in total, 201 of them resulted in screening 
failures, most of them due to iron levels that were too low. The SAP specified that the first 120 
randomised would be included in an initial double-blind analysis, with a sensitivity analysis performed on 
the final number randomised. Once all subjects had withdrawn or completed the open label phase, the 
analyses were to be repeated for the complete dataset. Sixty four subjects were treated with Feraccru in 
the double-blind and open-label phases had a total duration of treatment of median 445.5 days and mean 
311.8 days (SD 177.12). Total dose of Feraccru received was median 23340.0 mg and mean 17703.8 mg 
(SD 10381.38). Forty seven subjects were treated with placebo in the double-blind phase and Feraccru in 
the open label phase had a duration of Feraccru treatment of median 365.0 days and mean 293.7 days 
(SD 125.66). Total dose of Feraccru received was median 21240.0 mg and mean 17493.2 mg (SD 
7037.00). The blind was broken on 8 December 2013. The Statistical Analysis plan was finalised and 
signed on the 5 December 2013. No changes were made to the planned analysis after the database was 
locked. A decision was made on which subjects would be included/excluded from the per protocol analysis 
based on a review of protocol deviations.  
These focused on changes in Hb concentration. For the primary endpoint, missing randomisation Hb 
values were replaced by screening Hb values if the randomisation was within the protocol-specified 
window. The robustness of the primary efficacy analysis on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) was confirmed 
(p<0.0001) by a range of sensitivity analyses, including Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) 
analysis, Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) and analysis of the Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS). 
A pre-specified analysis was performed with the study data analysed as an integrated data set from the 
two study protocols. Effectiveness was analysed by determining whether the combined test group showed 
a statistically significant superiority compared to the combined control group. 
In addition, a post-hoc analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint data by IBD diagnosis has been 
performed. The Applicant re-analysed the combined dataset for the primary efficacy endpoint, according 
to IBD diagnosis in the study subjects. 
Slightly more subjects were randomised into study ST10-01-302 (CD) compared to ST10-01-301 (UC); 
however, the mean age, race proportions and gender split was very similar across the two groups. In 
both studies, all randomised subjects were included in the FAS and only a few subjects were excluded 
from the PP set. A small number of subjects withdrew from the randomised phase of the study due to AEs 
and this was similar in both groups, suggesting that background disease did not affect AE profile. The 
proportion of subjects taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) was similar between the two study groups, as 
was the proportion being treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) medication. More subjects with 
UC were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)-type medications but this was to be expected. Median 
duration of treatment was lower in the ST10-01-302 (CD) group, although the mean durations of 
treatment were very similar between the two groups. 
Double-blind Phase 
In terms of the primary endpoint (first 120 patients randomised), in Feraccru subjects there was a mean 
overall improvement in Hb levels of 2.25 g/dL (ST10-01-31/302 CSR1). In contrast, mean Hb levels in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 24/58 
 
  
  
placebo subjects were virtually unchanged (11.10 g/dL (SD 0.793) at baseline and 11.13 g/dL (SD 0.970) 
at Week 12. The mean improvement in Hb levels delivered by Feraccru was statistically significantly 
different (p<0.0001) compared to placebo. Feraccru therefore met the primary efficacy endpoint of 
change in Hb concentration after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo. 
This mean overall improvement in Hb levels of 2.25 g/dL is in excess of the pre-specified change of 1 
g/dL and clinically can be considered a highly meaningful change. 
The robustness of the primary efficacy analysis on the FAS was confirmed (p<0.0001) by all applied 
sensitivity analyses including analysis of the PPAS; analysis of the FAS using an LOCF approach; analysis 
of complete cases (subjects with both baseline and Week 12 Hb concentrations) in the FAS; analysis of 
the FAS using an MMRM approach and analysis of the FAS excluding the non-compliant subjects. 
Furthermore, the change from baseline to week 12 in Hb was analysed by pattern mixture model (PMM) 
using placebo imputation for withdrawn subjects and a baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) 
analysis in order to assess the effectiveness of treatment taking into account subject discontinuation. 
Even though this is a conservative approach, the estimated treatment differences are still large and 
statistically significant for both studies (UC: above 2 g/dl in both cases, CD: 1.87 [0.28] and 1.84 
[0.23]), (p<0.0001). 
The primary endpoint analysis was performed on all 128 subjects randomised and the results from this 
analysis were entirely consistent with the results from the primary efficacy analysis performed on the first 
120 subjects (Figure 1): mean Hb levels improved in Feraccru subjects from baseline (mean Hb 11.00 
g/dL [SD 1.027]) to Week 12 (mean Hb 13.20 g/dL [SD 1.044]), i.e., a mean overall improvement of 
2.20 g/dL. Mean Hb levels in placebo subjects were similar at 11.10 g/dL (SD 0.851) at baseline and 
11.15 g/dL (SD 1.039) at Week 12. 
Figure 1. Change in Haemoglobin from Baseline to Week 12 (ST10-01-301/302) (Full Analysis 
Set; N = 128) 
The baseline Hb would be expected to be a predictor of response because there is a physiological upper 
limit on Hb and patients with a baseline Hb close to normal would not have a large Hb rise, compared to 
those subjects with a baseline Hb much lower. Patients with a lower baseline Hb value did have a greater 
response in terms of Hb increase at week 12 compared to subjects with relatively high Hb at baseline. 
However, the difference compared to placebo in all sub-groups below normal at baseline was still greater 
Assessment report

Page 25/58 
 
  
  
 
than 2 g/dl and the pvalue <0.0001. Although the Hb difference was less in patients with normal Hb at 
baseline, there was still a clinically significant rise of 1.11 g/dl recorded and the p-value compared to 
placebo was <0.0001. Baseline Hb therefore correlates with the magnitude of the response but not with a 
responder subset. Moreover, responder analysis show a clear relationship between baseline Hb level and 
the likelihood of achieving a 1 g/dl, a 2g/ dl rise in Hb, or of achieving either Hb within the normal range 
or a 2 g/dl rise. 
In contrast, baseline ferritin, providing it was below normal, does not appear to be a predictor of 
response. There was no significant difference between means (Feraccru compared to placebo) in patient 
with ferritin <15 μg/l compared to subjects with baseline ferritin >15 - <30 μg/L. 
Patients with normal ferritin (>40 15-<30 μg/l) at baseline do appear to have lower Hb rise in response 
to treatment with Feraccru. This is most likely because the subgroup of patients with normal ferritin also 
had a starting Hb closer to normal. The responder analysis however, showed that there was a higher 
percentage of responders in the <15 μg/L group (83.9% and 60.7% achieving a 1 g/dl and 2 g/dl rise, 
respectively) compared to the 15-<30 μg/L group (42.9% and 28.6%). However, the percentage of 
patients that were “responders” as defined by Hb within the normal range or a 2 g/dl increase was similar 
in both sub-groups (76.8% vs. 71.4%). Responder rates between UC and CD patients were comparable 
and there was no significant difference in Hb level change from baseline. 
Sub-group analysis confirmed that there was no apparent effect of gender or age on the change from Hb 
at Week 12. Subjects starting with a lower baseline Hb tended towards a greater increase in Hb than 
subjects starting with a higher baseline Hb, by Week 12. 
Feraccru met all key secondary efficacy endpoints that were statistically significantly greater compared to 
placebo in both the first 120 patients randomised in all 128 patients, including: 
• Achieving at least an increase of 1 g/dL from baseline Hb concentration at Week 12 (p<0.0001) 
• Achieving at least an increase of 2 g/dL from baseline Hb concentration at Week 12 (p<0.0001) 
• Achieving normalised Hb concentration at Week 12 (p<0.0001) 
• Achieving improved Hb concentration at Weeks 4 and 8 (p<0.0001). 
The logistic regression analyses performed confirmed that the odds of achieving a 1 g/dL increase over 
baseline and a 2 g/dL increase over baseline with Feraccru were significantly greater than with placebo. 
Disease type did not significantly affect these odds. Similarly, the logistic regression analysis confirmed 
that the odds of achieving a normalised Hb concentration with Feraccru were significantly greater than 
with placebo. Disease type did not significantly affect the odds of achieving a normalised Hb 
concentration. 
Twenty-eight patients in the Feraccru group did not achieve an increase of 2 g/dl over baseline Hb 
concentration. Amongst these subjects very few appear to have a less than 2 g/dL rise indicating that 
earlier resistance is not predictive of response to ferric maltol. No patient with a baseline Hb of less than 
10 g/dL had less than a 2 g/dL rise.  
A rise of less than1 g/dL from baseline in Hb concentration at Week 12 was reported for 14 out of 64 
(21.9%) subjects. However, a rise of less than1 g/dL from baseline in Hb concentration at Week 12 was 
also conservatively applied to subjects not returning to a follow-up visit. As six subjects did not have a 
Week 12 determination of haemoglobin, only 8 subjects had an actual increase of less than 1 g/dL from 
baseline to Week 12. These subjects did not have any characteristics in common other than being more 
likely to have Crohn’s disease than ulcerative colitis: they ranged in age and percentage compliance, were 
males and females, had received different prior iron treatments and as a group experienced both 
increases and decreases in IBDQ from baseline to Week 12. Therefore there was no pattern in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 26/58 
 
  
  
demographic characteristics of these subjects linked to a lower Hb response; however as discussed 
previously a higher starting Hb was associated with a smaller Hb rise by week 12. 
The mean improvement in Hb levels to Week 4 and Week 8 delivered by Feraccru was statistically 
significantly different (p<0.0001) compared to placebo. Feraccru therefore met the secondary efficacy 
endpoints of change in Hb concentration after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment compared to placebo. 
Before the study treatment all patients in the study ST10-01-301 had an SCCAI score of 3 or below. The 
SCCAI scores gradually increased over the 12 weeks of the study. At week 12, 18.9% of subjects had 
scores of 4 or above. In study ST10-01-302, all patients had a CDAI score of 220 or below before start of 
the treatment. There was a slight trend towards increased over the 12 weeks of the study. There was no 
difference between the SCCAI and CDAI scores recorded at 12 weeks in patients on active compared to 
placebo treatment (for ST10-01-301/302 CSR2 Section 12.5.3 and 12.5.4). 
Patients randomised had active disease. The number of subjects who had baseline scores of 170 or less 
was around 40% (25 [39.1%] in the Feraccru group and 27 [42.2%] in the placebo group). In other 
words, 40% of AEGIS patients were not “quiescent” at baseline. This is supported by data that confirm 
that 38.7% of all patients were receiving TNF inhibitors and 30.6% were on azathioprine. In sub-study 
ST10-01-301, the majority of patients (51.7%) had experienced a disease flare in the previous 6 months. 
In study ST10-01-302, the average duration since last flare was longer than in study ST10-01-301: 
32.9% of subjects had experienced a disease flare in the previous 6 months and 72.9% in the previous 
18 months. The duration since last flare was evenly matched in subjects randomised to Feraccru 
treatment and to placebo treatment for both study protocols. 
Double-blind and Open Label Phase 
When the placebo subjects were transferred to Feraccru treatment in the open-label phase, there was a 
sharp rise in Hb levels that mirrored the response in the Feraccru group in the double-blind phase (Figure 
2). There were further increases in Hb up to 48 weeks of treatment and no indication of any reduction in 
efficacy over the full 64 week treatment period.

Analysis Set)

As described above both sub-groups showed a highly significant increase in Hb compared to baseline after 
12 weeks treatment with Feraccru, and this appears to be sustained or increased out to week 64 of open 
label treatment. However, patients treated with placebo in the double blind phase and with Feraccru in 
the open phase achieved a slight numerical lower Hb increase than those treated with Feraccru over the 
study period. Subjects were randomised to treatment arm stratified for baseline Hb; there were no 
obvious imbalances in demographic data or starting Hb. After 12 weeks of Placebo treatment though (and 
no meaningful Hb rise) the withdrawals in the Placebo group could have led to a slight shift in study 
subject characteristics during the Open Label phase. However, it should be noted that the study was not 
powered or designed to compare efficacy of Feraccru between the two treatment arms in the open label 
phase and there is significant overlap in the errors bars of the mean Hb levels in the 2 groups at week 64. 
Overall, mean iron indices (ferritin, iron, transferrin, transferrin receptor, total iron binding capacity and 
transferrin saturation) in Feraccru subjects improved from baseline over 12 weeks. Overall, mean iron 
indices in placebo subjects remained unchanged over the same period. In the open-label period ferritin 
continued to rise (but without leading to toxicity or overload) past Week 12. After Week 12 the 
improvement in iron plateaus and the improvement in transferrin and transferrin receptor increased only 
minimally. Iron-binding capacity continued to fall gradually with longer-term treatment. Transferrin 
saturation increased significantly from Baseline with Feraccru treatment; but stabilised at this higher level 
by Week 12/16. 
Post-hoc Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Results 
A small set of post-hoc analysis were performed on the primary endpoint and within each study 
population. This used the same multiple imputation model and analysis model (ANCOVA) as the primary 
analysis, except for disease state. This analysis was performed on the FAS and Per Protocol (PP) datasets. 
The estimated mean difference in Hb change at Week 12 was very similar in the two study subgroups 
when compared to the single IBD dataset. 
The p-values for the separate studies were both <0.0001, demonstrating independently significant 
results. These results strongly confirmed that the anaemia-correcting effect of Feraccru is independent of 
the cause of IBD and that Feraccru works equally well in patients with UC and CD. 
The analyses were also repeated on subgroups that reflected disease severity (e.g. baseline disease 
activity score, use of biological anti-TNF agents, time since last flare), concomitant medications possibly 
causing drug interactions (e.g., ASAs or PPIs), age and gender. 
For each subgroup the ANCOVA analysis was repeated including subgroup and subgroup-by treatment 
interaction terms. The results were presented as 1-sided 97.5% confidence intervals. 
These were plotted as Forest plots (see Figures 3 and 4).

The subgroup analysis conducted within studies ST10-01-301 and ST10-01-302 gave estimated mean 
differences in Hb at Week 12 between 2 and 3 g/dL improvement; very similar to the overall result. There 
were no subgroups where the difference trended to a worse or significantly greater result. Although the 
numbers in the individual groups were sometimes small, the lower 97.5% CI of all subgroups fell well 
above the 0 g/dL treatment difference. 
Comparison of the Rate and Extent of Hb Correction with Feraccru 30 mg bid with Published Results for 
Existing IV Iron Products  
It has been reported that IV iron does not correct IDA any faster or more effectively than oral iron 
(Bastani, 2000). Figure 5 compares the rate and extent of the increase in Hb observed in study ST10-01-
301/302 with those published for the IV iron products ferric carboxymaltose (Kulnigg, 2008; Evstatiev, 
2011) and ferric sucrose (Evstatiev, 2011) in subjects with IDA. The data suggest that Feraccru is as fast 
and as effective in correcting Hb levels as IV iron products and indicates that it is a viable alternative to 
IV iron therapy in the proposed patient population.

Comparison of the Efficacy of Feraccru with Other Oral Iron Preparations  
A comprehensive comparison of the efficacy of Feraccru with published efficacy data of other oral iron 
preparations, used both first and second line was conducted by the MAH. The MAH has also reviewed 
other published data on change in Hb with iron treatment. 
A meta-analysis was conducted including data from study ST10-01-301/302 and 21 published studies 
(Pereira 2015). The median duration of supplementation with ferrous sulphate for these 21 trials was 6 
weeks (range 4-20 weeks) and the reported mean Hb increase was 2.2 g/dL (SD 1.2). The mean increase 
with Feraccru at 4, 8 and 12 weeks was 1.08, 1.79 and 2.26 g/dL, respectively. 
The reviewed studies and those included in meta-analyses varied with regards to design, objectives, 
number of subjects included, tolerance or intolerance to previous oral iron treatment, dose of elemental 
iron, iron compound and formulation, comparator (active versus placebo), route of administration, 
duration of treatment, baseline Hb concentration, and patient condition (non-IBD versus IBD); there was 
none that matched all features of ST10-01-301/302. The mean increase in Hb over 12 weeks (2.26 g/dL) 
with Feraccru was in line with those observed with other effective oral iron first-line treatments in IBD, 
including studies with subjects with lower Hb baselines. 
The duration of treatment in all of these studies was 6-8 weeks, while generally at least 12-weeks 
treatment is required with Feraccru in IBD patients.  
In the meta-analysis, there was no significant difference for the comparison of change in Hb increase 
between ferrous sulphate and Feraccru with duration of supplement and baseline Hb as covariates in the 
ANCOVA model. There was, however, a significant main effect of duration of supplementation (p = 0.027) 
and a pronounced significant main effect of baseline Hb (p = 0.001). Hb increase seen in the first 20 
weeks of supplementation with Feraccru was in line with that observed with ferrous sulphate in the 21 
studies. Furthermore, there was a tendency for a linear association between Hb increase and duration of

treatment in the first 12 weeks (double-bind) phase of supplementation with Feraccru but this did not 
reach statistical significance (p = 0.074).  
Two of the studies in the meta-analysis used modified release formulations (the rest used standard 
ferrous sulphate). The results from these studies are identified (as MR) below. The study of Guerra 
Merino et al was in post-partum subjects, 7 of whom received oral iron (120 mg per day); the study of 
Bayoumeu et al was in pregnant women, 25 of whom were treated with oral iron (240 mg per day). The 
studies in IBD are shown adjacent to each other. Only one of the 21 studies (Sutton) had an oral placebo 
control; the other had an IV ferrous sulphate control. 
In most, but not all of the studies listed in the table below, the baseline Hb was appreciably lower than in 
ST10-01-301/302 (baseline of approximately 11 g/dL) and/or the daily dose of elemental iron was higher. 
The meta-analysis showed no significant difference between oral ferrous sulphate and Feraccru in terms 
of Hb increase (ANCOVA). There were significant effects of duration of treatment and baseline Hb. This 
result was achieved despite the dose of elemental iron in the oral ferrous sulphate groups (including MR 
ferrous sulphate) being higher than in ST10-01-301/302 (around 180 mg versus 60 mg per day). 
Regarding the studies mentioned in the above table, 5 studies were performed in postpartum patients 
(Bhandal, Breymann, Guerra Merino, Seid, Van Wyck), 4 in pregnant women (Kochar, Vazquez Pacheco, 
Al-Momen, Bayoumeu), 4 in non-dyalisis CKD (Agarwal, Charytan, Tokars, Van Wick), 2 with cancer 
(Auerbach, Henry), 1 in patients with hip and knee replacement (Sutton) and 1 in patients with heavy 
menorragia (Van Wyck). All of these studies compared ferrous sulphate vs. intravenous treatment. 
Hb change observed in almost all studies included in the previous table was similar to the one achieved in 
clinical trials conducted with Feraccru (pivotal phase 3 study ST10-01-301/302). In CKD patients Hb 
change was remarkable smaller than in the other groups, perhaps due to a different response to 
treatment with iron in this specific group of patients.

Supportive Studies 
Three supportive studies provided further information on the efficacy of Feraccru in patients with IDA. 
Doses of Feraccru equivalent to 10/67 mg, 30/202 mg, and 60/403 mg of iron/maltol per day were 
examined. Treatment duration ranged up to 3 months. 
Comparison of Feraccru (ferric maltol) equivalent to 10 mg elemental iron/day versus ferrous sulphate 
equivalent to 180 mg elemental iron/day (Blake & Kelsey) 
The first study was a comparative study in which 31 patients with IDA were randomised (2:1) to receive a 
20 ml solution of Feraccru (10 mg iron/day) or ferrous sulphate tablets 200 mg TID (180 mg iron/day). 
The study duration was 12 weeks, with assessment of haematological response (Hb, MCV, reticulocyte 
count, serum ferritin) performed every 2 weeks. In this study, Feraccru was administered in the fasted 
state and ferrous sulphate after a meal.  
Response to Administration of Feraccru (10 mg iron/day) or Ferrous Sulphate (180 mg iron/day) 
There was a positive haematological response in both treatment groups; however, 8 of 9 patients in the 
ferrous sulphate group achieved an Hb level within the normal range compared to 1 of 15 patients treated 
with Feraccru. The lower response to Feraccru appears to be due to the 18 times lower dose of iron (10 
mg daily) administered via Feraccru compared with the group treated with ferrous sulphate (180 mg 
daily). Serum ferritin did not alter significantly in patients receiving Feraccru. 
This was due to the fact that all the available iron was being used for haemopoiesis and was not available 
for storage whilst anaemia persisted (Blake & Kelsey). In this study only 1 of 15 patients treated with 
Feraccru achieved an Hb level within the normal range, probably because of lower dose of iron 
administered in the group of Feraccru vs. ferrous sulphate. 
A randomised study of ST10 (ferric maltol) equivalent to 30mg elemental iron/day versus ferrous sulfate 
equivalent to 18 mg elemental iron/day in anemic patients (Green & Thompson) 
In this second study, thirteen patients with IDA were randomised (1:1) to treatment with either ferrous 
sulphate tablets 200 mg (60 mg iron) tid (n=6) or Feraccru solution, 80 mg (10 mg iron) tid (n=7) for 12 
weeks. In the group treated with Feraccru, Hb rose by a mean of 1.4g/dl, serum iron levels by 5.1μmol/l, 
and ferritin by 3.7μg/l. The values achieved remained below the lower limit of normal in most patients. 
Five patients withdrew in the ferrous sulphate group as a result of AEs with only one patient in the ferrous 
sulphate group completing the study through 12 weeks. Therefore, between groups comparisons were not 
completed. The 5 patients who withdrew from ferrous sulphate treatment were reassigned to Feraccru 
after an appropriate washout period. Of the 12 patients who were treated with feraccru, only 1 withdrew 
from the study (as a result of AEs). The group treated with Feraccru achieved an increased in mean Hb 
level of 1.4 g/dL, while the increase in the group receiving ferrous sulphate is not stated.

In the Phase 2 study by Harvey et al (1998) which was an open-label uncontrolled study in which 23 
patients with IDA and documented intolerance to oral ferrous sulphate were treated with Feraccru 
capsules containing 30 mg iron bid for 3 months. Anaemia was fully corrected in 74% of patients who 
completed the study (14 out of 19 patients). There was a significant increase in mean Hb and ferritin 
from pre-treatment levels. After 3 months of treatment, there were 5 patients who still had low Hb 
concentrations. Two of these patients had substantially improved from baseline (7.6 to 11.8g/dl and 8.4 
to 10.6g/dl, respectively) and the remaining three were identified as having active bleeds, but were able 
to maintain Hb levels with Feraccru treatment. Seventy-three percent of the patients with IBD completed 
the study. Of these, 82% (n=9) experienced correction of their anaemia following treatment with 
Feraccru (Harvey, 1998). The results of this study demonstrated that Feraccru 30 mg bid, the proposed 
clinical dose, improved iron deficiency in patients with IDA who were intolerant to ferrous compounds. In 
this study (Harvey, 1998) anaemia was fully corrected in 74% of patients.  
In each of the three, GCP non-compliant studies described above, administration of Feraccru resulted in 
improvements in iron deficiency in patients, as evidenced by increases in blood Hb and ferritin 
concentrations. 
The studies conducted with Feraccru have been up to 12 weeks in duration. No evidence of loss of 
therapeutic effect has been observed in these studies. Furthermore, there is no evidence of persistence of 
efficacy or loss of therapeutic effect over time with ferrous sulphate in published literature. 
Studies and Reviews of Treatment of IDA in Non-IBD Subjects 
To provide information on use of other iron compounds, a number of papers describing non-IBD subjects 
were reviewed.  
Liu et al (2004) compared a combination ferrous fumarate product (ferrous fumarate, ascorbic acid, folic 
acid and cyanocobalamin, Ferall) and a polysaccharide iron complex (ferroglycine sulphate, Niferex) in 
IDA. In Taiwan, the location of the study, Niferex was one of the most common supplements used in IDA 
although the authors own experience was that patients achieved insufficient response. It was, however, 
claimed that it had an absorption profile comparable to ferrous fumarate but with fewer GI side effects. In 
this study, 39 subjects with IDA ( Hb <13 g/dL f or men and <12 g/dL for women) were randomised to 
one capsule of Ferall (equivalent to 151 mg elemental iron per day) and 41 to one capsule of Niferex 
(equivalent to 150 mg iron) for 12 weeks. The study was completed by 31 randomised to Ferall and 29 to 
Niferex; the analysis set included all those who received at least one dose and had at least one follow-up: 
these criteria were met by 36 subjects per group. 
A significant difference between products was seen from Week 4 onwards in favour of the combination 
ferrous fumarate treatment. 
Table 3 Haemoglobin Results from Liu et al (2004) 
Patil et al (2013) compared three different iron formulations in anaemic pregnant women. Twenty (20) 
subjects per group were treated with ferrous fumarate (plus folic acid and vitamin B12), ferrous

bisglycinate and carbonyl iron (each equivalent to 100 mg elemental iron and each with folic acid 1.5 mg 
and vitamin B12 10 μg) for 90 days. Hb levels increased from mean 8.96 (SD 0.74) g/dL at baseline to 
11.48 (0.89) g/dL at day 90 with ferrous fumarate. The Hb levels were mean 9.40 (0.55) and 11.59 
(0.46) g/dL at baseline and Day 90 with ferrous bisglycinate and 8.87 (1.17) and 11.10 (1.01) at Day 90 
with carbonyl iron. The three treatments were equally effective. 
Geisser (2007) reviewed over 25 years of experience with oral iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose (Maltofer). 
The review includes several studies in which patients were treated with 100 mg per day or 100 mg BID 
with pretreatment Hb levels comparable to those in AEGIS (i.e., mean 10.43 to 11.63 g/dL, with some 
higher, at up to mean 14.61 g/dL) who showed increases from baselines of around 10-11 of 0.96 to 1.35 
g/dL over period of approximately 2-3 months. Increases in those with higher baseline of about 14.5 g/dL 
were lower: 0.3 to 0.7 g/dL over 2-6 months. The ferrous sulphate control showed increases from 
baselines of around mean 10.6 to 11.4 of 1.3 to 1.8 g/dL over approximately 2 to 3 months. 
All of these studies showed a mean increased in Hb levels from 1.3 g/dL to 2.52 g/dL, being greater in 
those patients with lower baseline Hb level. These increments are in line with the ones observed in pivotal 
trials conducted with Feraccru. It also confirms that iron preparations are subject to the normal 
regulatory mechanisms controlling gastrointestinal iron absorption. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The applicant has not provided new studies to support this application to extend the indication for 
Feraccru from the treatment “in adults with Iron deficiency anaemia in patients with IBD” to the 
treatment of “adults with iron deficiency”. This extension is supported by pivotal trial conducted in the 
initial procedure (ST10-01-301/302) and published supportive studies.  
There are scarce data with regards to the use of Feraccru in other pathologies different to IBD. For this 
reason the applicant did a comparison between other iron preparations and Feraccru in order to 
demonstrate that changes in media Hb level are similar in all of disease settings.  
PK-data showed sufficient bioavailability in study- subjects with iron deficiency without anaemia and 
supportive clinical study data indicate that the recommended dose is sufficient to normalise iron blood 
indices in patients with ID/IDA or maintain Hb –levels in patients with active blood loss. Data from PK 
study (ST10-01-101) showed that although doses higher than 30 mg attained better efficacy the safety 
profile worsen. Moreover, taking into account PK parameters, there were no much differences between 30 
mg and the other two doses explored. 
Choice of dose: 
The efficacy of the active component iron can be considered ‘well established’ after resorption has taken 
place. It was agreed during the MA assessment that the active substance is not absorbed as a whole but 
only as two separate components Iron and Trimaltol. The low dosage of 60 mg of iron per day in Feraccru 
is also supported by several authorised OFPs and can therefore be considered well established as well. 
Therefore, 30 mg bid is considered an acceptable dose for patients with ID.  
There are few data comparing oral iron to intravenous iron preparations. However, with the available data 
it seems that intravenous iron preparations achieved Hb target levels faster than Feraccru and any oral 
iron preparation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 35/58 
 
  
  
The applicant provided a meta-analysis which includes an analysis of efficacy and safety of Feraccru 
compared to ferrous sulphate. There are 5 studies conducted in postpartum patients (Bhandal, 
Breymann, Guerra Merino, Seid, Van Wyck), 4 in pregnant women (Kochar, Vazquez Pacheco, Al-Momen, 
Bayoumeu), 4 in non-dyalisis CKD (Agarwal, Charytan, Tokars, Van Wick), 2 with cancer (Auerbach, 
Henry), 1 in patients with hip and knee replacement (Sutton) and 1 in patients with heavy menorragia 
(Van Wyck). Hb change observed in almost all of the studies included was similar to the one achieved in 
clinical trials conducted with Feraccru (pivotal phase 3 study ST10-01-301/302). In CKD patients Hb 
change was remarkable smaller than in the other groups, perhaps due to a different response to 
treatment with iron in this specific group of patients. The data submitted by the MAH indicate that 
patients with CKD seem to absorb oral iron in the same way as patients with other inflammatory 
diseases. The MAH is currently conducting a study in this population (ST 10-01-303), results are 
recommended to be provided when available in order to confirm efficacy in CKD patients.   
Duration of treatment 
The duration of treatment in all of these studies was 6-8 weeks, while generally at least 12-weeks 
treatment is required with Feraccru in IBD patients. Bearing in mind that, absorption of iron is under 
physiological control, and the greater the deficiency the greater the absorption; it is acceptable to have 
an individualised length of treatment. The duration of treatment is linked not only to replenishment of Hb 
levels but also to replenishment of iron stores. Therefore, treatment might be longer in severe cases. The 
treatment duration which was included in section 4.2 of the SmPC as part of the initial MA is also 
considered justified in non-IBD patients.  
Blake and Kelsey was a comparative study where patients received Feraccru or ferrous sulphate tablets. 
It included 31 patients with IDA. In most of cases cause of anaemia was not identified (51%). Rise in Hb 
levels in patients treated with ferric maltol 10 mg/day was between 1.1g/dL to 3.2g/dL at 12 weeks 
(n=5). Data at 8 weeks showed an increase from 0.1g/dL to 1.4g/dL.  
Green and Thomson was a comparative study where patients received Feraccru or ferrous sulphate 
tablets. It included 13 patients with IDA. In the group treated with Feraccru Hb rose by a mean of 
1.4g/dL, serum iron levels and ferritin also increased. As expected, it is observed that patients with lower 
Hb levels had a greater increase than patients with higher Hb levels. 
It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from both studies because of the low number of patients included, 
the dose administered was not the same as the currently proposed and baseline Hb was not 
homogeneous. However, it seems that patients with a longer treatment and with lower Hb levels had a 
better response.  
All these studies showed a mean increased in Hb levels from 1.3 g/dL to 2.52 g/dL, being greater in those 
patients with lower baseline Hb level. These increments are in line with the ones observed in pivotal trials 
conducted with Feraccru. It also confirms that iron preparations are subject to the normal regulatory 
mechanisms controlling gastrointestinal iron absorption. 
All these studies and those included in the meta-analyses did not match with clinical characteristics of 
patients included in the pivotal trial conducted with Feraccru. The design, number of subjects included, 
iron preparation, duration of treatment, baseline Hb level and baseline pathology are different making 
difficult the comparability. Bearing in mind all of these considerations, comparisons between different 
populations should be made with caution. However, the change in Hb level in these new population seems 
quite similar to the one obtained by Feraccru during pivotal study over 12 weeks (2.26 g/dL). 
There is another piece of information that could be used as a surrogate of efficacy in patients with ID. As 
it is shown in PK data available ferritin continued to rise over time, in spite of inflammatory status in 
some patients. It reflects the standard way of replenishment in ID patients, supporting that ferric maltol 
does work in case of iron deficiency without anaemia.

Although the approach to treatment should be individualised according to aetiology and severity, it is 
generally accepted that treatment should be initiated in patients with iron deficiency in order to avoid 
development of anaemia and also to improve some symptoms associated to iron deficiency. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The applicant has not provided new studies to support extension of indication to widen the indication for 
Feraccru  from  the  treatment  “in  adults  with  Iron  deficiency  anaemia  in  patients  with  IBD”  to  the 
treatment  of  “adults  with  iron  deficiency”.  This  extension  is  supported  by  pivotal  trial  conducted  in  the 
initial procedure (ST10-01-301/302) and published supportive studies.  
PK-data  show  sufficient  bioavailability  in  study-  subjects  with  iron  deficiency  without  anaemia  and 
supportive  clinical  study  data  indicate  that  the  recommended  dose  is  sufficient  to  normalise  iron  blood 
indices in patients with ID/IDA or maintain Hb –levels in patients with active blood loss. 
Overall,  Feraccru  is  bioavailable  and  as  a  result  effective  in  iron  deficiency  patients  with  and  without 
anaemia. 
Although  the  approach  to  treatment  should  be  individualised  according  to  aetiology  and  severity,  it  is 
generally  accepted  that  treatment  should  be  initiated  in  patients  with  iron  deficiency  in  order  to  avoid 
development of anaemia and also to improve some symptoms associated to iron deficiency. 
According to the data submitted by MAH, patients with CKD seem to absorb oral iron in the same way as 
patients with other inflammatory diseases.  
The  CHMP  recommends  the  submission  of  the  results  of  study  ST10-01-303  when  available  in  order  to 
confirm efficacy in CKD patients. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  total  number  of  patients  treated  with  Feraccru  was  128  (age  range  18-76  years;  45  males  and  83 
females).  The  primary  clinical  safety  data  are  provided  from  the  pivotal  phase  III  efficacy  and  safety 
study, from the protocols ST10-01-301 and ST10-01-302, including data from both the 12-week double-
blind  phase  and  the  52-week  open-label  phase.  The  safety  data  from  these  study  protocols  were 
combined  in  a  pre-specified  analysis.  Additionally,  the  pivotal  study  included  a  PK  sub-study  (ST10-01-
102) in which some safety endpoints were measured.  
Safety data was also collected in the prospective PK study (ST10-01-101). In this study, the total number 
of subjects treated with Feraccru was 24; 9 with 30 mg bid, 8 with 60 mg bid and 7 with 90 mg bid; all 
cohorts were treated for 8 days. 
The safety data from studies ST10-01-301, ST10-01-302, ST10-01-101 and ST10-01-102 are supported 
by  3  studies  from  published  literature  and  unpublished  data  on  file.  Study  SWIN-189-IM  was  a 
randomised, double-blind placebo controlled crossover study conducted in 120 volunteers. A further study 
in 13 patients evaluated the safety of Feraccru solution (30 mg iron/day) and ferrous sulphate tablets 180 
mg/day (Green & Thompson). 
Harvey, 1998 studied the safety of  Feraccru  capsules (30  mg  bid)  in  24  IDA  patients.  Overall,  doses  of 
Feraccru of 10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg and 90 mg dosed bid have been examined. 
Safety Profile of Feraccru 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 37/58 
 
  
  
Studies to date in animals and man show that iron released from orally administered  Feraccru does not 
differ  in  pharmacological  activity  from  iron  administered  in  existing  iron-containing  preparations.  Intact 
Feraccru  has  only  been  found  within  the  GI  tract  in  pharmacological  and  toxicological  studies  and  the 
unabsorbed portion is found in the faeces in rat, dog and man (Barrand, 1991). Because Feraccru is not 
absorbed  as  a  complex  molecule,  the  toxicological  profiles  of  iron  and  maltol  as  individual  moieties  are 
critical and relevant to evaluating the potential safety profile of Feraccru. 
Safety Profile of Iron 
Locally,  iron  has  direct  corrosive  effects  on  the  GI  mucosa,  resulting  in  ulceration,  oedema,  bleeding, 
venous  thrombosis,  infarction  and  perforation  (Tenenbein,  1990).  The  severity  of  these  local  corrosive 
effects depends on the quantity of iron ingested, the concentration of iron in the preparation, the form of 
iron, the duration of its contact with the mucosa and the amount of mucosal protection provided by food 
in  the  stomach  at  the  time  of  ingestion;  greatest  mucosal  damage  with  OFPs  occurs  on  an  empty 
stomach.  Reactive  oxygen  species  are  produced  in  excess  by  neutrophils  in  inflamed  intestinal  mucosa 
and  are  thought  to  contribute  significantly  to  the  tissue  injury  in  IBD.  As  free  ferrous  iron  is  a  strong 
catalyst  of  ROS  production,  oral  ferrous  iron  therapy  may  worsen  symptoms  in  IBD  patients  and 
potentially contribute to the disease process  and disease exacerbation. This has been shown in multiple 
pre-clinical studies (de Silva, 2005) and confirmed in clinical practice. 
Adverse  events  associated  with  OFPs  are  abdominal  pain,  nausea  and  vomiting,  constipation,  diarrhoea 
and  dark  stools.  Contact  irritation  can  occur  with  ferrous  sulphate  tablets  resulting  in  erosion  or 
ulceration, particularly if they become lodged in the upper GI tract. 
Safety Profile of Maltol 
Maltol occurs naturally in a variety of foodstuffs and synthetic maltol is widely used as a food additive and 
has been marketed for many years in pharmaceutical formulations as an excipient and in food products 
as a flavour enhancer. In addition, maltol is listed as a GRAS substance (Generally Recognised As Safe). 
The nonclinical toxicology data support the dose of maltol delivered in Feraccru. 
There were weakly positive results reported in some genotoxic studies. 
However, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) carried out a comprehensive 
review of the genotoxicity of maltol and concluded that the inconsistent weakly positive results observed 
with  high  concentrations/doses  of  maltol  were  not  relevant  to  human  oral  intake.  This  conclusion  is 
supported by the results of dietary carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice described previously in which 
no carcinogenic effects were apparent in either species. 
The  WHO  defines  the  accepted  daily  intake  of  maltol  as  1  mg/kg/day.  The  estimated  intake  of  maltol 
through Feraccru, given a person weighing 65 kg is 6 mg/kg/day, which would exceed the accepted daily 
intake.  However,  the  accepted  daily  intake  of  maltol  as  defined  by  the  WHO  is  applicable  for  a  food 
supplement and is based on lifetime exposure.  Feraccru is designed to treat anaemia and treatment will 
be stopped when Hb levels and iron stores are returned to the normal range. 
Moreover,  Maltol  has  a  long  history  of  use  as  a  flavouring  agent  and  dietary  toxicity  studies  ranging  in 
duration  from  6  months  in  both  rats  (two  studies)  and  mice  (one  study)  to  24  months  in  rats  and  18 
months  in  mice  with  minor  toxic  effects  observed.  Taking  the  most  conservative  approach  the  NOAEL 
level  in  animals  is  more  than  20  times  the  daily  dose  of  maltol  given  in  Feraccru  on  a  mg/kg  basis, 
increasing to 50 to 80 times the daily dose based on the 2nd study in dogs and the 18 and 24 month mice 
and rat studies. 
In  man,  the  maltol  component  of  Feraccru  undergoes  extensive  first-pass  metabolism  and  is  rapidly 
glucuronidated  and  renally  excreted.  In  the  pivotal  GCP  PK  study  conducted  in  patients  with  IDA,  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 38/58 
 
  
  
plasma  and  urine  concentrations  of  maltol  and  maltol  glucuronide  were  measured  after  single  and 
repeated b.i.d. oral doses of 30 mg, 60 mg and 90 mg for 8 days in subjects with iron deficiency (with or 
without anaemia (Study ST10-01-101). In the subjects administered up to 90 mg b.i.d. for 8 days, three 
times  higher  than  the  therapeutic  dose,  there  was  no  indication  that  the  metabolic  capacity  for 
glucuronidation and excretion of maltol was approached. Similar results were obtained in study ST10-01-
102, a PK sub-study of subjects receiving 30 mg ST10 b.i.d. in the open label phase of the pivotal efficacy 
studies,  ST10-01-301  and  ST10-01-302.  In  these  studies,  exposure  to  maltol  glucuronide  was  again 
considerably  higher  than  exposure  to  maltol,  and  only  0.266%  of  the  maltol  dose  administered  was 
excreted unchanged in the urine, compared to an equivalent of 41.6% as maltol glucuronide. 
These  findings  are  consistent  with  the  maltol  component  of  Feraccru  undergoing  extensive  firstpass 
metabolism and being rapidly glucuronidated and renally excreted at up to 3 times the therapeutic dose 
at steady state, as observed in early clinical and nonclinical studies. Clinical data on exposure of subjects 
with IDA for up to 64 weeks also shows that the effect of ferric maltol is positive with regard to Hb and 
iron stores, and any absorbed maltol does not have the effect of chelating iron stores. 
In conclusion, the administration of 6mg/kg/day maltol for the duration of Feraccru therapy is covered by 
both long-term animal toxicology data, and PK and long-term clinical safety data in man. 
Adverse Event Monitoring 
Monitoring  of  AEs  was  conducted  throughout  the  pivotal  Feraccru  studies.  Subjects  were  expected  to 
volunteer  information  about  AEs  they  experienced.  In  addition,  the  Investigator  or  designee  questioned 
the subject at each visit about AEs and recorded these as well as all other AEs apparent at the visit. New 
AEs,  including  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  were  captured  on  the  CRFs  after  informed  consent  and 
until 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  
New-onset AEs and  SAEs  were monitored until  they were resolved or clearly determined to be due to a 
subject’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness. 
Laboratory results were compared to up-to-date reference ranges and flagged if outside the normal range 
or  the  protocol-specified  range  for  randomisation  and/or  continued  study  participation.  Investigators 
reviewed all laboratory test results and if a value was flagged as abnormal, the Investigator documented 
the  abnormality  as  ‘clinically  significant’  (CS)  or  ‘nonclinically  significant’  (NCS).  Any  laboratory 
abnormality  assessed  as  ‘CS’  was  recorded  as  an  AE  if  not  explained  by  a  coexisting  condition  as 
documented in the medical records. 
In study ST10-01-301, in subjects with quiescent UC, the SCCAI score was evaluated at every clinic visit 
and  in  study  ST10-01-302,  in  subjects  with  quiescent  CD,  the  CDAI  score  was  evaluated  at  clinic  visits 
according to the schedule of assessments. 
Physical  examination  was  conducted  and  vital  signs  (blood  pressure  and  heart  rate),  body  weight  and 
height were measured according to the schedule of assessments. No special approaches were employed 
to monitor particular AEs. This is considered acceptable since the likely GI AEs would be detected by the 
AE monitoring described above. 
Nature of the Patient Population and Extent of Exposure 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Feraccru  for  the  treatment  of  iron  deficiency  anaemia  was  studied  in  128 
patients  (age  range  18-76  years;  45  males  and  83  females)  with  inactive  to  mildly  active  IBD  (58 
patients  with  Ulcerative  Colitis  [UC]  and  70  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  [CD])  and  baseline  Hb 
concentrations between 9.5 g/dL and 12 / 13 g/dL for females / males.

In the PK study (ST10-01-101) and the two pivotal safety and efficacy studies (ST10-01-301 and ST10-
01-302)  Feraccru  was  tested  in  a  range  of  ages,  from  18-76  years.  In  the  post-hoc  subgroup  analysis, 
there was no difference in results between subjects <60 years of age and those older than 60 years.  
The safety of Feraccru in children has not yet been established. Agreement was received from the EMA on 
23rd September 2013 on a paediatric investigation plan (PIP), on granting a deferral and on the granting 
of  a  waiver  for  children  less  than  6  months  old  for  Feraccru.  The  PIP  covers  paediatrics  aged  from  6 
months to 18 years of age and requires the development of an age appropriate formulation, together with 
the conduct of PK and clinical studies. 
Gender 
In the PK study (ST10-01-101) and the double-blind phase of the two pivotal safety and efficacy studies 
(ST10-01-301 and ST10-01-302)  Feraccru  was tested in  both genders including  women  of child-bearing 
potential. In these  studies,  Feraccru  was evaluated  in 128 subjects (83 females [40  and  43 in  Feraccru 
and Placebo double-blind phase groups, respectively] and 45 males [24 and 21 in  Feraccru and Placebo 
double-blind  phase  groups,  respectively]).  In  the  phase  3  studies,  the  safety  of  Feraccru  for  the 
treatment of IDA in IBD was evaluated in 111 subjects in the open-label phase.  
Race and Ethnicity 
The  majority  of  patients  treated  with  Feraccru  in  the  two  pivotal  clinical  studies  were  of  non-
Hispanic/Latino  white  origin.  A  literature  search  on  the  impact  of  racial  or  ethnic  differences  on  iron 
treatment  outcomes  provided  limited  conclusive  data  and  suggested  a  current  lack  of  understanding 
about  the  factors  influencing  disparities  in  prevalence  and  risk  factors  relating  to  IDA  and  IBD  across 
ethnic  and  racial  groups.  There  are  no  known  ethnic  variations  in  the  normal  uptake  or  metabolism  of 
iron. 
Cause of ID/IDA 
Phase 3 data has been generated in patient with IBD. Patients with IBD are commonly intolerant to OFPs 
because GI inflammation occurring in this disease state enhances the GI side effects of OFP treatments. 
This patient population is therefore considered to be a ”worst case” scenario and the side effect profile in 
IDA associated with any other disease state is likely to be more favourable or at least no worse than the 
side effect profile observed in patients with IBD. 
Baseline IBD Disease 
The  two  pivotal  safety  and  efficacy  studies’  (ST10-01-301  and  ST10-01-302)  patients  had  either  UC  or 
CD  respectively.  Of  the  128  subjects  randomised,  58  (29  in  the  Feraccru  and  Placebo  groups, 
respectively) had UC compared to 70 (35 in the Feraccru and Placebo groups, respectively) with CD. The 
incidence  and  severity  of  all  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  are  very  similar  for  the  UC  (ST10-01-
301)  and  CD  (ST10-01-302)  patients.  There  are  no  marked  differences  in  the  incidence  of  individual 
adverse events or in the number or severity of events in any SOC comparing the two populations. 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
The  majority  of  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  defined  a  study  population  consistent  with  the 
intended patient population authorised. 
Severity of IBD, Baseline Hb and Hypersensitivity  
Severity of Disease and Baseline Hb levels had  no impact on the safety  profile  (measured  by  TEAEs) in 
cumulative ST10-01-301/302 data.  
There  were  no  related  hypersensitivity  reactions  recorded.  The  only  unrelated  Immune  System  AE 
recorded  was  seasonal  allergy,  reported  in  4  (3.6%)  of  subjects  (3  mild;  1  moderate).  Therefore,  no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 40/58 
 
  
  
safety data could be analysed in patients with hypersensitivities. 
A  number  of  exclusion  criteria  excluded  patients  from  the pivotal phase  3 protocols,  thereby  potentially 
narrowing  the  study  patient  population  in  comparison  to  that  which  would  be  treated  with  Feraccru  in 
clinical practice. The safety implications of the differences of these two patient populations are discussed 
below. 
Subjects without IBD were excluded from the studies. The efficacy and safety of Feraccru in patients with 
IBD  can  be  extrapolated  to  patients  with  other  disease.  The  pivotal  PK  study  (ST10-01-101)  was 
conducted in patients with iron deficiency, not restricted to IBD and is therefore relevant for patients with 
ID caused by other factors. Iron homeostasis is regulated at the level of iron uptake by body iron stores, 
although  the  exact  mechanism  is  not  completely  understood.  There  are  no  available  data  that  indicate 
that  the  distribution  and  utilisation  of  iron  differ  substantially  between  subgroups  of  patients  with  ID. 
Patients  with  IBD  do  not  always  respond  adequately  to  oral  iron  therapy,  because  of  a  combination  of 
non-compliance due to side effects and impaired absorption due to IBD inflammation. This population can 
therefore be considered a worst case in terms of both efficacy and safety. The Phase 3 studies show that 
Feraccru  is  effective  in  this  population  and  it  reasonable  to  extrapolate  the  effectiveness  to  other  sub-
population of patients with ID Subjects who had received within 12 weeks prior to randomisation either a 
blood  transfusion  or  erythropoietin  therapy  were  excluded  from  the  studies  as  such  recent  treatments 
could be expected to alter a potential subject’s iron deficiency status. However in clinical practice, it may 
be appropriate for a patient who has had a blood transfusion or erythropoietin to be treated with Feraccru 
for  ongoing  IDA.  However,  Feraccru  is  contraindicated  for  patients  who  received  repeated  blood 
transfusions. 
Subjects who had received within 4 weeks prior to randomisation vitamin B12 injection/infusion, folic acid 
injection/infusion  or  an  immunosuppressant  with  known  effect  of  anaemia  induction,  including,  but  not 
limited to methotrexate, cyclosporin A or tacrolimus,  were excluded from the studies. This was because 
the drugs may alter the status of a subject’s IDA by inducing or correcting anaemia. In clinical practice, it 
could be appropriate to treat such patients with Feraccru. 
Subjects  with  vitamin  B12  concentration  below  the  LLN  or  folic  acid  deficiency  were  excluded  from  the 
studies. This is because a lower amount of these substances could affect responsiveness to iron and the 
aim  of  studies  ST10-01-301  and  ST10-01-302  was  to  assess  the  effect  of  Feraccru  on  patients  with 
anaemia due to iron deficiency. Both vitamin B12 and folic acid play an important role in iron absorption 
and are often co-administered with iron replacement therapy. 
Subjects  with  creatinine  >2.0  mg/dL  (176  μmol/L)  or  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  or  aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) levels ≥5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were excluded from the studies. 
A raised creatinine level indicates mild renal impairment and elevated liver enzymes can be an indication 
of  impaired  hepatic  function.  Iron  is  not  metabolised  and  excreted  and  maltol  is  rapidly  metabolised  to 
maltol  glucuronide in  the intestinal  mucosa  prior  to being  renally  excreted.  Glucuronides  form  a  routine 
route  of  excretion  and  there  are  no  data  to  indicate  any  toxicity  of  maltol  glucuronide  in  the  renally 
impaired. 
Subjects with history of malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of in situ removal of basal 
cell  carcinoma  were  excluded  from  the  study.  This  exclusion  was  in  place  for  completely  operational 
reasons to avoid losing subjects who may have recurrence of their cancer or need for  further treatment. 
In practice, there is no reason why such subjects could not be treated with Feraccru. 
Broad  exclusion  criteria  for,  firstly,  subjects  with  cardiovascular,  liver,  renal,  haematologic,  GI, 
immunologic,  endocrine,  metabolic,  or  central  nervous  system  disease  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the 
Investigator, may have adversely affected the safety of the subject and/or efficacy of the study drug or 
severely limit the lifespan of the subject and; secondly, subjects with significant neurologic or psychiatric 
Assessment report

symptoms  resulting  in  disorientation,  memory  impairment,  or  inability  to  report  accurately  that  might 
interfere  with  treatment  compliance,  study  conduct  or  interpretation  of  the  results  (e.g.,  Alzheimer’s 
disease, schizophrenia or other psychosis, alcohol or drug abuse) were excluded. The rationale for these 
exclusions  was  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  subjects  in  the  study  and  to  deliver  good  treatment 
compliance.  Therefore,  these  differences  in  study  and  future  patient  population  do  not  have  safety 
implications. 
Patient exposure 
Extent of Exposure in Clinical Trial 
A total of almost 400 subjects have been exposed to Feraccru in completed studies. 
A total of 135 subjects with IDA received Feraccru at a minimum dose of 30 mg bid in the pivotal clinical 
pharmacology and phase 3 studies. The majority of these subjects received the drug for between 12 and 
64 weeks. In ST10-301/302, a total of 111 patients were treated with  Feraccru for up to 64 weeks. The 
64  subjects  treated  with  feraccru  in  the  double-blind  and  open  label  phases  of  ST10-01-301/302  had  a 
total duration of treatment of median 445.5 days and mean 311.8 days. Total dose of  Feraccru received 
was  median  23340.0  mg  and  mean  17703.8.  The  47  subjects  treated  with  placebo  in  the  double-blind 
phase and Feraccru in the open-label phase had a duration of  feraccru treatment of median 293.7 days 
and mean 219.8 days. Total dose of Feraccru received was median 21240.0 mg and mean 17493.2 mg. 
A  further  250  subjects  have  been  exposed  to  Feraccru  in  the  non-GCP  compliant  studies;  22  subjects 
received the proposed therapeutic daily dose of 60 mg  Feraccru. The majority of these subjects received 
the drug for between 1 and 3 months. A further 112 subjects received a daily dose of 100 mg or higher. 
The  remaining  subjects  received  10  or  30  mg  daily.  In  an  unpublished  study  (SWIN-189-IM),  120 
patients were exposed to a dose of >100 mg (180 mg) Feraccru daily for 4 days. 
In the pivotal phase 3 study, 65 patients were exposed to Feraccru for >1 year at study completion with 
a  further  8  exposed  for  363  days.  The  ICH  guideline  on  the  extent  of  population  exposure  to  assess 
clinical  safety  for  new  active  substances  intended  for  long-term  treatment  of  non-life  threatening 
conditions states that 100 patients exposed for a minimum of one-year is considered to be acceptable to 
include  as  part  of  the  safety  data  base.  The  data  should  come  from  prospective  studies  appropriately 
designed to provide at least one year exposure at dosage levels intended for clinical use. However, it is 
considered that the size of the safety database is appropriate, given that Feraccru completely dissociates 
to iron and maltol. 
In ongoing clinical studies in patients with IBD (ST10-01-304) and CKD (ST10-01-303) a further 61 and 
96 patients (assuming 2;1 randomisation for the latter), respectively, have been exposed to Feraccru for 
up  to  52  weeks  at  the  therapeutic  dose  of  30  mg  bid  (cut-off  date:  11  August  2017).  No  new  safety 
signals have been observed. 
Extent of Marketed Exposure 
The extent of patient exposure to marketed product is discussed in the latest PSUR. No new safety signals 
have been observed compared to clinical exposure. 
Adverse events 
Common Adverse Events 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in  Feraccru  subjects  in  the  double-blind  were  GI-related:  abdominal 
pain, flatulence, constipation, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea, and nausea.  
Assessment report

Nasopharyngitis and arthralgia were also frequently reported. The most common AE in Placebo subjects 
was  nasopharyngitis;  a  number  of  GI-related  events  were  also  common,  including  abdominal  pain, 
Crohn’s disease and diarrhoea; haemoglobin decreased, headache, fatigue, and oropharyngeal pain were 
also common in Placebo-treated subjects.  
The profile of adverse events in the open-label phase to data cut-off was comparable to that of Feraccru-
treated  subjects  in  the  double-blind  phase.  The  most  common  TEAEs  (>5%)  were  abdominal  pain, 
ulcerative  colitis,  Crohn’s  disease,  diarrhoea,  flatulence,  nausea,  arthralgia,  back  pain  and  cough.  The 
overall proportion of subjects with TEAEs of the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC was 23 (46.0%) for those 
previously treated with Feraccru and 25 (53.2%) for those previously treated with Placebo, but several of 
the  more  common  gastrointestinal  symptoms  (abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  flatulence  and  nausea) 
occurred  more  frequently  in  those  new  to  Feraccru  treatment  (i.e.,  those  previously  treated  with 
placebo). 
Tolerability  to  Feraccru  was  very  good:  86%  of  Feraccru  subjects  completed  double-blind  treatment 
compared to 83% in the placebo group. 
Feraccru  has  a  good  safety  profile  as  demonstrated  by  its  benign  AE  profile  generally  and  a  similar  GI 
events  profile  to  placebo,  as  well  as  its  lack of  effect  on  vital  signs  and  physical  examination  data.  The 
proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  AEs  in  the  double-blind  phase  was  generally  similar  in  both  groups 
and slightly lower in the Feraccru group. As expected in an IBD population, GI-related AEs were the most 
common,  with  similar  proportions  of  subjects  reporting  GI  events  in  both  treatment  groups.  Data 
indicated that Feraccru did not exacerbate IBD symptoms over the 12-week treatment period. The rate of 
drug-related  AEs  was  low  and  similar  in  both  treatment  groups;  flatulence,  constipation  and  abdominal 
discomfort/distension occurred more frequently following Feraccru administration.

demonstrated  in  the  double-blind  phase.  In  the  cumulative  data  set,  the  most  common  TEAEs  were 
gastrointestinal  in  nature,  with  the  majority  becoming  apparent  within  the  first  12  weeks  of  treatment. 
The  most  common  treatment-related  events  in  the  cumulative  data  set  were  abdominal  pain, 
constipation,  diarrhoea  and  flatulence,  and  these  tended  to  be  reported  within  the  first  12  weeks  of 
Feraccru treatment. The SCCAI and CDAI demonstrated that Feraccru did not exacerbate IBD symptoms 
over the 12-week double-blind treatment period or during open label treatment. There was no indication 
of  any  increase  in  frequency  or  severity  of  AEs  with  duration  of  treatment.  Moreover,  age,  gender, 
severity of disease, disease sub-group and Baseline Hb had no impact on the safety profile. 
There  were  no  meaningful  changes  in  either  group’s  IBDQ  scores  from  randomisation  to  Week  12.  In 
Feraccru subjects mean total IBDQ score at randomisation was 175.0 (SD 30.92) and 178.3 (SD 32.36) 
by  Week  12.  In  placebo  subjects  mean  total  IBDQ  score  at  randomisation  was  171.0  (SD  33.56)  and 
176.3  (SD  31.50)  by  Week  12.  Over  longer-term  treatment,  the  scores  for  each  assessment  remained 
relatively constant. The absence of a change in IBDQ scores indicates that  Feraccru did not worsen IBD 
symptoms over 64 weeks of long-term therapy. 
It  was  noted  that  17.1%  of  Feraccru  study  patients  had  TEAEs  indicating  IBD  aggravation,  but  disease 
activity scores were not altered. 
To exclude an aggravating effect of Feraccru on the IBD-condition the outcome of patients was analysed 
who either had an aggravation of their IBD severity score and/or for whom one or more IBD associated 
TEAEs  were  recorded.  Moreover,  the  score  data  of  the  individuals  with  vs.  without  IBD-associated  AEs 
was compared. 
An  improvement  of  IBD  score  was  recorded  for  12  subjects  (18.8%)  in  the  Feraccru  group  and  18 
subjects  (28.1%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Worsening  was  recorded  for  similar  numbers  in  each  group:  9 
(14.1%)  in  the  Feraccru  group  and  10  (15.6%)  in  the  placebo  group.  These  results  suggest  that  IBD 
deterioration with Feraccru is similar to placebo by the relatively conservative definition of a deterioration 
of 16 points reduction in IBDQ score. 
Overall  the  number  of  subjects  with  IBDQ  worsening  or  an  IBD-related  AE  were  identical  in  the  two 
treatment  groups  during  the  double-blind  phase.  The  number  of  subjects  in  each  group  with  an  IBD 
associated AE (but no IBDQ worsening) were very similar; (25% and 23.4%, Feraccru and Placebo). The 
number of subjects in each group with IBDQ worsening but no associated AEs was higher in the Placebo 
group (3.1% and 12.5%). Therefore, during the double-blind phase, for which there is placebo controlled 
data, Feraccru did not appear to worsen IBD symptoms as measured by IBDQ, or by IBD-associated AES, 
when  compared  to  the  Placebo  group.  Not  surprisingly,  there  were  more  discontinuations  owing  to 
adverse events in the categories with IBD-associated TEAEs and the chance of discontinuing was highest 
in the category with both IBDQ worsening and IBD associated TEAEs. 
Although  there  is  no  comparator  group  during  the  open  label  phase,  and  because  of  the  cumulative 
nature of handling AEs, it is expected that the AE rate is higher compared to the Double-Blind phase. In 
addition because IBD is a relapsing-remitting disease (and Feraccru is not a disease modifying agent) the 
proportion of subjects who experience some worsening of disease over the Open-Label phase would also 
be  higher.  The  actual  rate  of  IBDQ  worsening  add/or  IBD  associated  AEs  was  43%  at  the  end  of  the 
open-Label  phase;  comparing  this  to  the  double-blind  rates  shows  no  evidence  of  IBD  disease  activity 
worsening with long-term Feraccru exposure.  
Therefore, performed analysis did not identify greater risk of IBD deterioration with Feraccru than placebo 
by  the  relatively  conservative  definition  of  a  deterioration  of  16  points  reduction  in  IBDQ  nor  any  clear 
association  between  the  selected  IBD-associated  TEAEs  and  deterioration.  In  older  published  studies, 
good  tolerance  to  Feraccru  was  also  demonstrated  when  it  was  administered  to  patients  demonstrably 
intolerant of ferrous sulphate, with no reported AEs (Harvey et al, 1998).

Safety  data  comes  from  study  ST10-01-101  (PK  study)  and  pivotal  phase  3  study  (ST10-01-301/302). 
The most common AEs were gastrointestinal related adverse events. Most of them were mild to moderate 
more  common  being  in  the  first  12  weeks  of  Feraccru  treatment.  During  the  initial  procedure  it  was 
observed that in the double-blind part of the pivotal study some gastrointestinal AEs were more frequent 
with  Feraccru  compared  to  placebo  (e.g.  abdominal  discomfort,  abdominal  distension).  This  imbalance 
could reflect a similar safety profile compared to other iron containing preparations (ferrous). 
Long-term  safety  data  comes  from  ST10-01-301/302  extension  published  by  Schmidt  C.,  et  al  (Aliment 
Pharmacol  Ther  2016;44:  259-270).  From  a  total  of  128  patients  randomised  to  study  treatment  (the 
FAS),  50/64  (78%)  previous  ferric  maltol  patients  (the  ‘continued’  group)  and  47/64  (73%)  previous 
placebo patients (the ‘switch’ group) entered the long-term extension.  
Among  the  97  patients  who  entered  the  long-term  extension,  37/50  ‘continued’  patients  (74%) 
completed 64 weeks of ferric maltol treatment, and 36/47 ‘switch’ patients (74%) completed 52 weeks on 
open-label  ferric  maltol.  AEs  were  the  most  common  reason  for  patient  withdrawal  from  the  long-term 
extension (12 patients overall: eight in the continued group and four in the switch group; see ‘Safety and 
tolerability’ section for details). Most AEs (83%) were mild to moderate in severity and gastrointestinal. 
Safety profile of Feraccru in patients with IBD remains favourable after 64 weeks. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the double-blind phase of studies ST10-01-301/301 there were 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) in the 
Feraccru group and 2 SAEs in the placebo group. None were related to treatment. 
In the open-label phase, there were 8 SAEs in the group previously treated with  Feraccru and 2 SAEs in 
one  subject  previously  treated  with  placebo.  Of  all  of  these  reports  none  were  reported  as  probably 
related to treatment, whilst only one event of severe abdominal pain was reported as possibly related to 
treatment. 
In the PK study (ST10-01-101), one subject who received Feraccru 60 mg experienced an SAE of abscess 
which led to study withdrawal due to unplanned hospitalisation. The SAE was considered unrelated to the 
drug; indeed, the patient continued to take Feraccru 60 mg bid after study withdrawal. 
After the completion of ST10-01-101, there was a case of pregnancy reported. It was estimated that the 
patient  had  become  pregnant  before  receiving  Feraccru.  Urine  pregnancy  tests  conducted  during  the 
study  were  all  negative.  The  pregnancy  was  followed  up  via  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities.  There 
was also a case of pregnancy in study  ST10-01-302: pregnancy tests were negative  during the double-
blind  phase  and  at  the  first  visit  during  the  open-label  phase.  Four  days  after  this  visit,  the  subject 
performed  a  pregnancy  test  which  was  positive,  confirmed  on  the  following  day  by  a  positive  urine 
pregnancy test at the study site.  
The subject was withdrawn from the study and subsequently gave birth to a healthy infant. In Study 302, 
the  date  of  conception  was  approximately  12  weeks  after  the  start  of  treatment  with  ferric  maltol.  In 
Study 101, the date of conception was calculated to be prior to the start of treatment with ferric maltol 
(based  on  gestational  age).  It  is  therefore  unlikely  that  a  drug-drug  interaction  with  the  contraception 
played  a  role  in  either  pregnancy.  This  is  consistent  with  the  lack  of  a  recognised  class  DDI  with  the 
contraceptive 
pill 
(FSRH:

Hormonal 
Contraception,

http://www.fsrh.org/pdfs/CEUGuidanceDrugInteractionsHormonal.pdf). 
There were no deaths reported in any of the studies with Feraccru. 
The only significant  changes in laboratory values in ST10-01-301/302 following treatment with  Feraccru 
were  those  measures  that  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  the  drug,  i.e.,  serum  iron  indices:  total  iron,

transferrin  saturation  and  ferritin;  these  parameters  all  improved.  Vital  signs  and  physical  examination 
were unremarkable and similar in both treatment groups. 
Relation of Adverse Events to Dose, Dose Regimen and Treatment Duration 
The  64  subjects  treated  with  Feraccru  in  both  the  double-blind  and  open-label  phases  of  the  pivotal 
studies had  a total duration of treatment of median  445.5 days and mean 311.8 days. The 47 subjects 
treated  with  placebo  in  the  double-blind  phase  and  Feraccru  in  the  open-label  phase  had  a  duration  of 
Feraccru treatment of median 365.0 days and mean 293.7 days. 
The  frequency  of  adverse  reactions  appeared  to  lessen  with  treatment  duration  in  the  double  blind  and 
open label phases of the pivotal phase 3 study (ST10-01-301/302). In the limited safety data collected in 
the  pivotal  PK  study  (ST10-01-101),  probably  unsurprisingly  there  appears  to  be  a  trend  towards 
increased frequency of adverse events reported as the dose increased from 30 mg bid to 60 mg bid to 90 
mg  bid.  Size  (8  subjects)  and  design  of  the  study  ST10-01-101  however  does  not  allow  meaningful 
conclusions to be made about the relative safety of 30mg, 60mg or 90mg of ferric maltol BID, compared 
to other published studies or the Phase 3 ST10-01-301/302 studies. 
During the PK study (ST10-01-101) it was observed that the percentage of AEs is related to the dose with 
57.1% of patients who received 180 mg daily, 50.0% received 120 mg daily and 22.2% received 60 mg 
daily. As stated before, the selected dose was 30 mg bid considering not only efficacy but also the safety 
profile. 
Overdose 
There were no incidences of overdose reported during the double-blind and open-label phases of the two 
pivotal studies following  treatment with  Feraccru. Iron is not easily eliminated  from  the body and acute 
iron  overdose  may  result  in  toxicity.  Ingestion  of  20  mg/kg  elemental  iron  is  potentially  toxic  and 
ingestion of 200-250 mg/kg, or serum iron levels of greater the 300 ug/dL is potentially fatal. Although 
Feraccru  is  not  currently  proposed  for  use  in  children,  it  is  noted  that  over-dosage  of  ferrous  salts  is 
particularly dangerous to young children. 
The lower amount of ferric iron in Feraccru (30 mg) and recommended daily dose of 2 capsules compares 
favourably  to  ferrous  sulphate  tablets  200  mg  which  contain  the  equivalent  to  65  mg  ferrous  iron  and 
recommend  an  adult  daily  dose  is  2-3 tablets  daily.  Therefore,  Feraccru  has  a  greater  margin  of  safety 
than  that  of  oral  ferrous  sulphate  preparation  with  respect  to  potential  overdose.  In  addition,  the  iron 
from  Feraccru  is  under  physiological  control,  further  protecting  against  the  risk  of  accidental  overdose 
with Feraccru. 
There  is  no  information  on  the  potential  for  dependence,  rebound  phenomena  or  abuse  with  Feraccru. 
There  is  no  published  information  to  suggest  any  of  these  effects  exist  for  other  iron  replacement 
products or maltol; there is therefore no reason to expect these effects to be associated with Feraccru. 
Comprehensive Comparison of the Safety of Feraccru with Other Oral Iron Preparations 
Comparison of Feraccru Data with Published Data 
The meta-analysis performed by Pereira (2015) demonstrated: 
• Feraccru has a similar GI AE rate to FeSO4. However, studies ST10-01-301/302 (AEGIS) recruited only 
FeSO4 intolerant subjects; and  the IV comparator studies excluded subjects who could not tolerate oral 
iron. The AE and GI AE risk to Feraccru-treated subjects is thus no higher than that of first line patients 
taking FeSO4. 
• The GI AE all causality rate is no worse than the overall rate of FeSO4 in IV comparison studies (i.e. in 
patients with more significant diseases). Furthermore, the OR of GI AEs for  Feraccru has an upper 95% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 46/58 
 
  
  
CI below the overall OR, suggesting benefit compared to FeSO4. 
• The same finding (a better OR relative to FeSO4) is apparent for the IBD subset of studies (in FeSO4 
tolerant subjects)  
• OR for modified release iron products appears worse than the overall data. There is no suggestion that 
modified release products should be used second line or in preference to Feraccru, and these findings do 
not support using modified release products as a comparator to Feraccru 
• The GI AE rate for Feraccru is in line with FeSO4 data in relation to dose. 
Safety data of Feraccru PK studies was also compared to published data of  standard OFPs. As ST10-01-
102 was a sub-study of studies ST10-01-301/302 and no AEs occurred during PK analysis, evaluation was 
only  performed  with  ST10-01-101  data.  The  most  frequent  treatment-related  adverse  events  with 
Feraccru are gastrointestinal in nature in common with other oral iron treatments. However, the incidence 
of  such  events  is  lower than  in  many  of  the  published  studies  with  ferrous  sulphate  and other oral  iron 
treatments. 
In  study  ST10-01-101  treatment  with  Feraccru  at  30  mg  bid  of  9  subjects  for  7  days  was  very  well 
tolerated  with  no  treatment-related  AEs,  no  discontinuations  because  of  adverse  events.  These  results 
compare  favourably  with  ferrous  sulphate  clinical  studies  (as  reported  in  Pereira,  2015  for  ferrous 
sulphate) where a placebo-controlled study was described with a total of 12 (out of 20) subjects reporting 
symptom(s)  during  the  first  week  of  study  treatment,  of  which  9  (75%)  were  in  the  ferrous  sulphate 
group. 
As  the  duration  of  treatment  for  ferrous  sulphate  in  Pereira,  2015  was  generally  longer  than  in  the 
Feraccru PK study, PK data of ST10-01-101 was compared more accurately with the paper of Gordeuk et 
al (1987), which reported the adverse events after treatment with standard dose ferrous sulphate for one 
week (high dose Fe 600 mg three given as nontoxic carbonyl Fe compared with standard ferrous sulphate 
60 mg Fe++). It was described that GI AEs occurred in 20/24 subjects (83%) with the standard ferrous 
sulphate arm, which is higher than reported with the highest dose of Feraccru in ST10-01-101. Individual 
AEs  were  constipation  (4,  17%),  diarrhoea  (3,  13%),  heartburn  (2,  8%),  nausea  (14,  48%),  epigastric 
pain (3, 13%), abdominal cramps (3, 13%), and unpleasant taste (4, 17%) plus headache (2, 8%) and 
weakness (4, 17%). The great majority of AEs were mild; the remainder were severe in intensity. 
The  applicant  provided  two  published  articles  which  includes  safety  data in  relation  to existing  oral iron 
products (Pereira 2015 and Tolkien 2015). Conclusions from both studies were:  
Ferrous  sulphate  supplementation  significantly  increased  risk  of  gastrointestinal  adverse  events  (GIAEs) 
relative to placebo with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.32 [95%CI 1.74–3.08, p<0.0001] and versus IV iron with 
an OR of 3.05 [95% CI 2.07-4.48, p<0.0001]. Subgroup analysis in IBD patients showed a similar effect 
versus  IV  iron  (OR  =  3.14,  95%  CI  1.34-7.36,  p=  0.008).  A  significant  increase  in  the  incidence  of 
treatment-related  AEs  was  observed  with  Feraccru  in  the  AEGIS  trial  (OR=3.22  [95%  CI  1.17-8.88], 
p=0.02). The odds ratios for all causalities GIAEs with Feraccru were lower than those of ferrous sulphate 
but  this  was  only  statistical  significant  when  compared  with  ferrous  sulphate  in  the  IV  iron-controlled 
trials (p=0.037).

Intensity of Adverse Events and Drug-related Adverse Events 
The Pereira (2015) meta-analysis report indicates that the severity of GIAEs with Feraccru falls into range 
of first line FeSO4 studies.  
Pereira  (2015)  reported  17.2%  and  14.1%  moderate-severe  GI  TEAEs.  However,  28.1%  moderate  –
severe GI TEAEs were reported for Feraccru (17.2% moderate plus 10.9% severe) vs. 20.3% placebo in 
studies ST10-01-301/302.  
Pereira et al. described the following frequencies of gastrointestinal AEs: 
Stratification  of  gastrointestinal  AEs  (GIAEs)  into  mild  and  moderate-severe  categories  for  ferrous 
sulphate, Feraccru and placebo. 
Taking into account inherent limitations of indirect comparisons it seems that Feraccru could have a lower 
frequency  of  mild  GIAEs,  while  moderate-severe  GIAEs  seems  to  be  greater  in  Feraccru  group  (AEGIS 
trial). 
Post marketing experience 
Feraccru is a new complex (chelate) of a chemical substance (iron) previously authorised as a medicinal 
product in the European Union; iron, complexed with maltol. There is therefore no world-wide marketing 
experience with Feraccru. 
However, various oral and IV iron products for the treatment of IBD have been marketed for many years 
in doses that, in the case of IV products, far exceed the daily dose recommended for  Feraccru. The non-
clinical and clinical safety of iron has been thoroughly investigated and can be regarded as well known. In 
addition,  iron  is  a  physiological  constituent  of  the  body  and  dose  levels  not  exceeding  physiological 
mechanisms of absorption, transport, storage, metabolism and excretion can be considered as safe. 
Maltol occurs naturally in a variety of foodstuffs and synthetic maltol is widely used as a food additive and 
has been marketed for many years in pharmaceutical formulations as an excipient and in food products 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 48/58 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
as a flavour enhancer. In addition, maltol is listed as a GRAS substance (Generally Recognized As Safe). 
Published  non-clinical  data  support  the  safety  of  the  maximum  daily  maltol  exposure  arising  from 
treatment with Feraccru. 
Withdrawals 
The discontinuation rate with Feraccru is in line with FeSO4 overall, but the new meta-analysis indicates a 
more favourable  rate for  Feraccru  in the  IBD  subgroup.  However,  it is noted that the ST10-01-301/302 
studies recruited only FeSO4 intolerant subjects. The discontinuation rate with Feraccru-treated subjects 
is thus comparable to that of first line non-IBD patients taking FeSO4 and appears more favourable than 
first line IBD patients taking FeSO4. 
Considering data from the initial procedure 18.0% discontinued because of AEs during Feraccru treatment 
and 7.2% discontinued because of Feraccru-related adverse events. Pereira et al. reported a mean rate of 
discontinuation due to treatment-related AEs of 7.1±8.1% for ferrous sulphate preparations compared to 
7.2% in the ST10-01-301/302 trial. 
Including long-term safety data from ST10-01-301/302 extension published by Schmidt C., et al (Aliment 
Pharmacol  Ther  2016;44: 259-270),  18/111  (16%)  patients  who  received  Feraccru  discontinued  due  to 
adverse events during 64-weeks of duration of the whole study.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall  safety  data  comes  from  study  ST10-01-101  (PK  study)  and  pivotal  phase  3  study  (ST10-01-
301/302).  In  the  pivotal  trial  the  safety  profile  of  the  ferric  maltol  group  was  worse  than  that  of  the 
placebo  arm.  There  were  more  AEs  related  to  treatment  (25.0%  vs  11.7%,  respectively),  moderate  to 
severe related TEAEs were also more frequently with Feraccru (17% vs 7% placebo). 
The most common AEs were gastrointestinal related adverse events: abdominal pain (11.7%) (including 
upper  abdomen),  flatulence  (6.7  %),  constipation  (8.3%),  abdominal  discomfort  (5.0%),  distension 
(3.3%), diarrhoea and nausea. Most of them were mild to moderate being more common in the first 12 
weeks of Feraccru treatment. During the initial procedure it was observed that in the double-blind part of 
the pivotal study some gastrointestinal AEs were more frequent with Feraccru compared to placebo (e.g. 
abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension.). The risks of oral iron preparations (OFPs) are  well known 
and mainly consist of common but benign gastro-intestinal ADRs of mild to moderate intensity. 
Long-term  safety  data  comes  from  ST10-01-301/302  extension  published  by  Schmidt  C.,  et  al  (Aliment 
Pharmacol  Ther  2016;44:  259-270).  Safety  profile  of  Feraccru  in  patients  with  IBD  remains  favourable 
after 64 weeks. 
During the PK study (ST10-01-101) it was observed that the percentage of AEs is related to the dose with 
57.1% of patients who received 180 mg daily, 50.0% received 120 mg daily and 22.2% received 60 mg 
daily. As stated before in the end the selected dose was 30 mg bid considering not only efficacy but also 
safety profile. 
The  MAH  provided  two  published  articles  which  include  safety  data  in  relation  to  existing  oral  iron 
products  (Pereira  2015  and  Tolkien  2015).  Taking  into  account  inherent  limitations  of  indirect 
comparisons it seems that  Feraccru  could have  a  lower risk of gastrointestinal AEs compared  to ferrous 
sulphate  preparations.  However,  it  has  to  be  considered  that  comparison  was  done  with  IBD  patients 
(ST10-01-301/302 AEGIS trial) not with the general population of subjects with ID/IDA. 
Considering  data  from  the  initial  procedure,  18.0%  discontinued  because  of  AEs  during  Feraccru 
treatment  and  7.2%  discontinued  because  of  Feraccru-related  adverse  events.  Pereira  et  al.  reported  a 
mean rate of discontinuation due to treatment-related AEs of 7.1±8.1% for ferrous sulphate preparations 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/172417/2018 
Page 49/58 
 
  
  
compared to 7.2% in the ST10-01-301/302 trial. In Schmidt C., et al (Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2016;44: 
259-270), 18/111 (16%) patients who received  Feraccru discontinued due to adverse events during 64-
weeks of duration of the whole study. 
According  to  Pereira  meta-analysis  it  seems  that  Feraccru  could  has  a  lower  frequency  of  mild  GIAEs, 
while moderate-severe GIAEs seems to be greater in Feraccru group (AEGIS trial). 
Bearing  in  mind  that  no  new  information  with  respect  to  initial  procedure  has  been  provided  by  the 
applicant,  it  is  considered  that  treatment  with  ferric  maltol  has  an  acceptable  safety  profile  in  patients 
with  IBD,  although  safety  information  from  a  quantitative  point  of  view,  remains  unknown  in  ID/IDA 
caused by other underlying pathologies different to IBD.  
In principle, long term treatment with iron preparations should not raise safety concerns considering the 
mechanism of iron replenishment in patients with iron deficiency, as long as the posology is  appropriate. 
On the other hand, trimaltol is unlikely to raise any important safety concern as it is widely used in the 
alimentary industry. 
In the second PSUR, covering the period from 19 August 2016 and 18 February 2017, the safety of the 
drug remains in accordance with the expected safety profile of Feraccru.  
The last PSUR submitted, covering the period from 19 February 2017 to 18 August 2017, is currently 
under assessment. In this PSUR 32 SAEs for Feraccru from interventional clinical trials versus 2 SAEs in 
the placebo groups and 7 SAEs in the IV comparator group were listed.  
The  comparison  of  32  SAEs  in  the  Feraccru  treatment  groups  vs.  9  SAEs  in  the  combined  comparator 
groups (Placebo and IV-iron) is skewed, since  most of  the  SAEs in the Feraccru-groups occurred  during 
the  long  term  open  label  extension  phase  where  there  was  no  comparator  treatment  any  more.  No 
imbalance in SAEs can therefore be attributed.  
There were no serious adverse reactions (SARs) reported during the interval period.  
The  safety  profile  is  not  expected  to  change  with  this  extension  of  indication,  as  the  safety  of  oral  iron 
tablets is well established and there is no signal pointing out to a different risk profile for Feraccru. 
Routine Pharmacovigilance monitoring and PSUR assessment are considered sufficient for the risk 
management of Feraccru. 
Additional safety information and data will be provided as part of ongoing study ST10-01-303 performed 
in CKD patients.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall  safety  data  come  from  study  ST10-01-101  (PK  study)  and  pivotal  phase  3  study  (ST10-01-
301/302). 
The most common AEs were gastrointestinal related adverse events. 
The  applicant  provided  in  this  procedure  mainly  two  published  articles  which  include  safety  data  in 
relation  to  existing  oral  iron  products  (Pereira  2015  and  Tolkien  2015).  Taking  into  account  inherent 
limitations of indirect comparisons it seems that Feraccru could have a lower risk of gastrointestinal AEs 
compared to ferrous sulphate preparations. 
The long term safety data base is still quite limited (< 100 study subjects with treatment duration over 1 
year). However, in principle, long term treatment with iron preparations should not raise additional safety 
concerns considering the mechanism of iron replenishment in patients with iron deficiency, as long as the 
posology is followed. In addition, trimaltol is unlikely to raise any important safety concern as it is widely

used in the alimentary industry. 
In the second PSUR, covering the period from 19 August 2016 and 18 February 2017, the safety of the 
drug remains in accordance with that expected. The last PSUR submitted, covering the period from 19 
February 2017 to 18 August 2017, is currently under assessment. Taking into account the data provided 
by the MAH, the risk profile of Feraccru in patients with iron deficiency is therefore considered acceptable 
and has not changed. Additional safety information and data will be provided as part of ongoing study 
ST10-01-303 performed in CKD patients.

The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The application to extend the indication from:  
‘Feraccru is indicated in adults for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (see section 5.1)’  
to ‘Feraccru is indicated in adults for the treatment of iron deficiency (ID).’  
does not involve a relevant impact on the PIL, Therefore, the company´s justification to not undertake 
further consultation with target patient groups is considered acceptable.

Iron  is  an  essential  micronutrient  that  is  required  for  adequate  erythropoietic  function,  oxidative 
metabolism  and  cellular immune  responses.  The  term  “anaemia”  is  sometimes  used  synonymously  with 
“iron  deficiency  anaemia”.  However,  these  terms  do  not  cover  the  same  reality.  There  are  about  2-5 
times more iron deficient people than individuals with IDA. Iron deficiency is diagnosed when low serum 
levels of ferritin or transferrin saturation are measured. The most common reasons for ID are insufficient 
iron  intake  in  the  diet,  an  inability  to  absorb  iron  well  in  the  body  and/or  loss  of  iron  in  blood  through 
bleeding. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia is caused by low 
levels  of  iron  in  the  body.  Iron  deficiency  anaemia  is  the  most  common  cause  of  anaemia  worldwide, 
affecting  over  2  billion  people,  which  equates  to  approximately  30%  of  the  world’s  population  (Pavord, 
2012;  NICE  CKS,  2013;  Zhu,  2010).  Epidemiological  surveys  indicate  that  in  Europe,  iron  depletion 
concerns 10-30% of  menstruating women with  1.5 to  14% progressing to  IDA. In pregnant women the 
prevalence  of  IDA,  according  to  different  studies  and  surveys,  ranges  from  6  to  30%  with  the  highest 
levels  observed  in  countries  such  as  Holland  (6-28%),  Denmark  (0-18%)  and  France  (9-30%)  where 
routine iron supplementation is not usually given during pregnancy (Hercberg, 2001). 
Iron  deficiency  is  a  common  complication  of  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD),  occurring  in  about  60-
80% of IBD patients. Approximately one-third of patients with IBD are also anaemic. Although anaemia in 
IBD  often  involves  a  combination  of  IDA  and  anaemia  of  chronic  disease,  IDA  remains  an  important 
contributor in this condition (Zhu, 2010). Importantly for the therapeutic action of Feraccru, the observed 
IDA in IBD patients does not appear to be due entirely to an inability to absorb oral iron, even in cases of 
severe chronic inflammatory disease (Erichsen, 2003; Bartels, 1978). 
Iron is absorbed at the apical surface of enterocytes to be transported by ferroportin, the only known iron 
exporter, across the basolateral surface of the enterocyte into circulation. Inflammation from IBD 
interferes with iron absorption by causing an increase in hepcidin, a peptide hormone synthesised in the 
liver that inhibits ferroportin activity.  
The serum markers of iron deficiency are low ferritin, low iron, raised total iron binding capacity, raised 
red cell protoporhyrin and increased transferrin binding receptor (sTfR). Serum ferritin is the most 
powerful test for iron deficiency. The cut-off level of ferritin which is diagnostic varies between 12-15 
μg/L. Higher levels of serum ferritin do not exclude the possibility of iron deficiency, and a serum ferritin 
level of <100 μg/L may still be consistent with iron deficiency in patients with IBD. A transferrin 
saturation of <16% is indicative of iron deficiency, either absolute or functional. Other findings on a 
complete blood count panel that are suggestive of iron deficiency anaemia, but are not considered 
diagnostic, include microcytosis, hypochromia and elevation of red cell distribution width. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The goals of treatment are to treat the underlying cause, limit further blood loss or malabsorption, avoid 
blood transfusions in haemodynamically stable patients, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life. 
More specifically, therapeutic goals of treatment include normalising haemoglobin levels within 4 weeks 
(or achieving an increase of >2 g/dL) and replenishing iron stores (transferrin saturation >30%).  
Oral iron supplementation has been considered standard treatment because of an established safety 
profile, lower cost and ease of administration. It has been shown to be effective in correcting anaemia 
and repleting iron stores. One concern with higher doses of daily oral iron is intolerance due to GI side 
effects. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation, and melena-like 
stools.

The  MAH  provided  published  studies  in  order  to  compare  the  increment  in  Hb  levels  with  ferrous  iron 
preparations vs. increment with Feraccru in the pivotal trial. All these studies showed a mean increased in 
Hb levels from 1.3 g/dL to 2.52 g/dL, being greater in those patients with lower baseline Hb level. These 
increments are  in line with the ones observed  in pivotal trials conducted with  Feraccru.  It also confirms 
that  iron  preparations  are  subject  to  the  normal  regulatory  mechanisms  controlling  gastrointestinal iron 
absorption. 
PK-data  show  sufficient  bioavailability  in  patients  with  iron  deficiency  without  anaemia  and  supportive 
clinical  study  data  indicate  that  the  recommended  dose  is  sufficient  to  normalise  iron  blood  indices  in 
patients with ID/IDA or maintain Hb –levels in patients with active blood loss. 
Feraccru is bioavailable and as a result effective in iron deficiency patients with and without anaemia. 
Although  the  approach  to  treatment  should  be  individualised  according  to  aetiology  and  severity,  it  is 
generally  accepted  that  treatment  should  be  initiated  in  patients  with  iron  deficiency  in  order  to  avoid 
development of anaemia and also to improve some symptoms associated with iron deficiency. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are limited data with regards to the use of Feraccru in other pathologies different from IBD. The 
CHMP recommends the submission of an ongoing clinical efficacy study in CKD patients (study ST10-01-
303) in order to confirm efficacy in CKD patients. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No new safety data has been submitted as part of this application. The most common AEs reported in the 
pivotal  trials  supporting  the  initial  MA  were  gastrointestinal  related  adverse  events  (3.3%  severe), 
abdominal pain  (11.7%), flatulence  (6.7%), constipation  (8.3%),  diarrhoea  (2.8%)  and nausea  (1.8%). 
Data form latest PSURs confirm that the safety of the drug remains in accordance with what is expected 
and currently reflected in the SmPC.  Overall, the safety profile of Feraccru is considered acceptable. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No new data have been submitted by the MAH as part of this extension of indication. Safety information 
from a quantitative point of view remains unknown in ID/IDA caused by other underlying pathologies 
different to IBD. However, routine pharmacovigilance is considered sufficient in order to monitor the 
safety profile of Feraccru in this extended indication.  
The  long  term  safety  data  base  is  limited.  However,  the  long  term  treatment  with  Feraccru  should  not 
raise  additional  safety  concerns  considering  the  mechanism  of  action  of  iron  replenishment  in  patients

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ferric maltol has shown to increase the Hb concentration correcting the anaemia at week 12 (change of 
2.25  gr/dl  from  baseline)  in  IBD  patients.  Indirect  comparisons  with  studies  using  ferrous  iron 
preparations suggested that increments are in line with the ones observed in pivotal trials conducted with 
Feraccru. 
The safety profile of Feraccru is considered acceptable and in line with other iron preparations. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  MAH  did  not  perform  new  studies  to  support  this  extension  of  indication  of  Feraccru  from  the 
treatment “in adults with Iron deficiency anaemia in patients with IBD” to the treatment of “adults with 
iron  deficiency”.  This  extension  is  supported  by  pivotal  trial  conducted  in  the  initial  marketing 
authorisation procedure (ST10-01-301/302) and published supportive studies. In the pivotal trial Feraccru 
has  shown  to  significantly  improve  the  Hb  concentration  (change  of  2.25  gr/dl  from  baseline)  over  12 
weeks of treatment in IBD patients compared to placebo. 
Feraccru  is  bioavailable  and  as  a  result  effective  in  iron  deficiency  patients  with  and  without  anaemia 
regardless  of  the  underlying  pathology.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  Feraccru  is  acceptable.  The  most 
common AEs were gastrointestinal related adverse events. 
There are limited data with regards to the use of Feraccru in other pathologies different to IBD.  
In principle, long term treatment with iron preparations should not raise safety concerns considering the 
mechanism of iron replenishment in patients with an iron deficiency, as long as the posology is followed. 
The  safety  profile  is  not  expected  to  change  with  this  extension  of  indication,  as  the  safety  of  oral  iron

tablets is well established and there is no signal pointing out to a different risk profile for Feraccru. 
The Benefit-Risk balance of Feraccru for  this  extension of indication to widen the  indication for  Feraccru 
from  the  treatment  “in  adults  with  Iron  deficiency  anaemia  in  patients  with  IBD”  to  the  treatment  of 
“adults with Iron deficiency” is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ferracru is positive in the following indication:  
“Feraccru is indicated in adults for the treatment of iron deficiency.”

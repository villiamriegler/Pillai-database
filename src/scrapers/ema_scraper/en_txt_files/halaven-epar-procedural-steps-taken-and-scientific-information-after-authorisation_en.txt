There is no relevant use of HALAVEN in the paediatric 
population for the indication of soft tissue sarcoma. Three 
open-label studies, Studies 113, 213 and 223, were 
conducted in paediatric patients with refractory or recurrent 
solid tumours and lymphomas, but excluding central 
nervous system (CNS) tumours. Efficacy of eribulin was 
assessed but not established in the three open-label 
studies. The safety profile of eribulin as monotherapy or in 
combination with irinotecan hydrochloride in this paediatric 
population was consistent with the known safety profile of 
either study drug in the adult population. Eribulin PK in 
paediatric patients was comparable to adult patients with 
STS and patients with other types of tumour. Eribulin 
exposure in paediatric patients was similar to exposure in 
adult patients. Concomitant irinotecan did not have an

Increased eribulin exposure was seen in some patients with 
moderately or severely impaired renal function, with high 
between-subject variability. The pharmacokinetics of 
eribulin were evaluated in a Phase 1 study in patients with 
normal renal function (Creatinine clearance: ≥ 80 ml/min; 
n=7), moderate (30-50 ml/min; n=6) or severe (15-<30 
ml/min; n=6) renal impairment. Creatinine clearance was

CI: 0.9-2.5) higher dose-normalised AUC(0-inf) was 
observed in patients with moderate and severe renal

patients with severely impaired renal function may require 
a reduction of dose however the optimal dose remains to 
be established.  In patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment, caution and close safety monitoring is advised 
without recommendation for specific dose adjustments.  
Eribulin is mainly eliminated through biliary excretion. In 
vivo studies submitted by the MAH show that eribulin 
exposure (AUC and Cmax) was not affected by Pgp 
inhibitors. In addition, on the basis of in vitro studies, it 
was concluded thateribulin is not a Pgp inhibitor and is not 
considered as a substrate for OCT1. As a consequence, 
sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC were updated to

relationship cannot be established at this point in time, 
there is enough circumstantial evidence to conclude that a 
causal relationship between eribulin and DIC is at least a 
reasonable possibility. Section 4.8 of the SmPC was 
updated to include DIC as a rare event.

opportunity of this variation to make a minor 
amendment to section 4.8 of the SmPC, to correct 
the spelling of the salt and to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet.

In the 1st PSUR of Halaven, two cases of pancreatitis were 
SmPC in order to include pancreatitis as requested 
by the CHMP following the assessment of the 1st 
PSUR. The Package Leaflet was updated in 
accordance. In addition, the text and format of the 
table of undesirable effects in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC has been changed to include the uncommon 
and rare events into the one table. Finally the MA 
date and numbers have been added to sections 8 
and 9 of the SmPC.

likely/certain drug reaction. As an outcome of the PSUR 
assessment, the CHMP requested the MAH to add 
pancreatitis in section 4.8 Undesirable effects. The Package 
leaflet was updated in accordance. The table of undesirable 
effects in section 4.8 of the SmPC was reformatted to 
include the uncommon and rare events already present in 
the section.

1.  Introduction 
On 02 May 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Cystic Fibrosis patients 12 years 
of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a gating or residual function mutation, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by decreased quantity and/or 
function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. CTFR is a channel that regulates the 
flow of chloride and other anions across epithelia in multiple organs and tissues, including the lungs, 
pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands. Despite progress in the treatment of CF 
with antibiotics and mucolytics, the current median age at death among people with CF is 
approximately 30 years, and the predicted median age of survival is approximately 47 years.  
The most common disease-causing mutation is F508del: approximately 84.7% of people with CF in the 
US and 81.1% in Europe have at least one F508del allele. At present, there is no cure for CF. CFTR 
modulators (CFTRm; i.e., correctors and potentiators) represent a major advancement in the 
treatment of CF because they are systemic therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease 
and have been shown to improve CF survival by modifying the course of disease. Approved treatment 
regimens include ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco™), lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA dual combination 
therapy (Orkambi™), tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA dual combination therapy (Symdeko™, Symkevi™) and 
elexacaftor (ELX)/TEZ/IVA triple combination therapy (TrikaftaTM, KaftrioTM).  
The elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) regimen previously demonstrated clinical benefit in 
patients with a single F508del allele, regardless of the mutation of the second allele. A pivotal Phase 3 
program in subjects with CF 12 years of age or older demonstrated that ELX/TEZ/IVA provides 
substantial improvements in lung function, CFTR function, and nutritional status, and was generally 
safe and well tolerated with a low rate of treatment discontinuation.  
Kaftrio obtained a marketing authorization in August 2020 and is currently indicated in a combination 
regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who 
have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
gene.  
The MAH now submitted the results of Study VX18-445-110 (“Study 110”) as per requirement of 
Article 46 of the “Paediatric Regulation” (EC) 1901/2006. Study 110 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-
label study (OLS) in subjects with CF 12 years of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a gating 
or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF genotypes), who completed Study VX18-445-104 (Study 
104). The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

The MAH stated that Study VX18-445-110 is a stand alone study.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The following tablets were used in the study:  
- 
- 
ELX/TEZ/IVA 100-mg/50-mg/75-mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet  
IVA 150-mg tablet 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for:  
Study VX18-445-110, a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study (OLS) in subjects with CF 12 years of 
age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF 
genotypes), who completed Study VX18-445-104 (Study 104). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study VX18-445-110 
Description 
Study VX18-445-110 was a Phase 3, 2-part, multicenter, OLS for subjects who completed the last 
Treatment Period visit in the parent study (Study 104) and met eligibility criteria (Figure 1). Subjects 
in certain countries who completed Part A had the opportunity to participate in Part B. 
The total study duration was up to approximately 148 weeks (from the first dose of study drug in this 
study), including a Treatment Period of up to 144 weeks (96 weeks in Part A and 48 weeks in Part B 
[in certain countries]) and a 4-week Safety Follow-up Period.  
The study period was from 05 December 2019 until 16 December 2022.

Figure 1 Study design 
CHMP comment 
Part B was added at the time of version 1.2 of the Clinical Study Protocol (14 May 2021) for all 
countries except NL, and version 1.3 (21 December 2021) for NL (see Conduct of Study below). 
However, according to the clinical overview submitted by the Applicant, patients in only certain 
countries were offered Part B of this study (those seem to be AU, BE, FR, IT, ES, and NL). It is not 
completely understood why Part B was only accessible for subjects in these countries. However, 
considering the sufficiently long treatment period of Part A, the fact that only safety was assessed in 
Part B, and most patients discontinued Part B due to commercial availability of Kaftrio, this issue is not 
further pursued. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The study included male and female CF subjects 12 years of age or older with F/G or F/RF genotypes.  
Key eligibility criteria are shown in Table 1.  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/297123/2023  
Page 5/39 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1 Key eligibility criteria in Study 110 
CHMP comment 
Key inclusion criteria of Study 104 were age 12 years and older, FEV1 value ≥40% and ≤90% of 
predicted, confirmed CF diagnosis, stable CF disease, and heterozygous for F508del and either a gating 
or residual function mutation (F/G or R/RF genotype). These inclusion criteria were previously 
considered acceptable. The additional exclusion criteria are also acceptable.  
Treatments 
All subjects received two FDC tables of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the morning and one IVA tablet in the evening 
(Table 2). This is the same dosage as that evaluated in the parent study, Study 104.  
Table 2 Dosages 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was administered for approximately 96 weeks in Part A and up to approximately 48 
weeks in Part B. 
CHMP comment 
The used dosing is in line with the parent study and the approved posology. The 96- or 144-week 
treatment period meets the safety assessment criteria of the EMA guideline on CF 
(CHMP/EWP/9147/08).

Objective(s) 
Primary objective:  
To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF who are 
heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating (F/G) or residual function (F/RF) mutation. 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the long-term efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  
Safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA based on adverse events (AEs), 
clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry.  
Secondary endpoints: 
-  Absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) 
-  Absolute change in sweat chloride (SwCl) 
-  Absolute change in body mass index (BMI) 
-  Absolute change in BMI z-score 
-  Absolute change in body weight 
-  Absolute change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain (RD) 
score.  
Sample size 
The primary and secondary objectives of the study are the evaluation of the long-term safety and 
tolerability, and long-term efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA. This is an open-label study that will enrol subjects 
who complete the last Treatment Period visit in the parent study and meet eligibility criteria. The 
parent study is a Phase 3 Vertex study investigating ELX/TEZ/IVA (Study 104).  
Approximately 250 subjects were planned to be enrolled.  
CHMP comment 
The primary endpoint of safety and tolerability after long-term treatment is appropriate for an open-
label extension study. Secondary endpoints are in line with commonly used efficacy endpoints.  
A sample size of 250 subjects for Part A is also considered acceptable. In the end, 251 patients were 
included. It appears that no sample size intention was set for Part B, which is acceptable considering 
the sufficiently long treatment period of Part A to assess long-term safety and tolerability.

Statistical Methods 
Analysis sets

EMA/297123/2023  
Page 7/39 
  
 
 
The following analysis sets were defined:  
-  Open-label (OL) All Subjects Set: all subjects who were enrolled (defined as subject having 
data in the clinical database) in the OLS.  
-  OL Full Analysis Set (OL-FAS): all enrolled subjects who have received at least 1 dose of 
study drug in the open-label study.  
-  OL Safety Set (OL-SS): all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the OLS.  
Efficacy analyses 
The parent study baseline is used to calculate the change from baseline for continuous efficacy 
endpoints unless otherwise specified. Data of continuous endpoints at visits in the parent study are 
analysed using the same mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach as described in 
the SAP for the parent study. The resulting estimates will be identical to what is in the CSR of the 
parent study. Similarly, data of continuous endpoints at visits in the OL efficacy period for Part A are 
analysed using a separate MMRM. The results obtained from the parent study and OLE efficacy period 
will be displayed one followed by the other.  
The focus of the efficacy analysis is to characterise the long-term treatment effects using change from 
baseline for each treatment group in the parent study. P values were not planned to be presented.  
Efficacy analysis is only applicable to Part A. 
Safety analyses 
The primary objective of the study was the evaluation of long-term safety and tolerability of the triple 
combination. All safety analyses for Part A and B are based on the treatment-emergent (TE) Period 
(i.e., time from first dose of Study 110 to 28 days after last dose or completion date of study 
participation) in the OL-SS. The overall long-term safety profile of study drug is assessed in terms of 
the following safety and tolerability endpoints:  
- 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
-  Clinical laboratory values 
- 
ECGs  
-  Vital signs  
- 
Pulse oximetry 
The triple combination safety baseline was planned to be used to calculate the change from baseline 
for continuous safety endpoints. The TC safety baseline is defined as the most recent non-missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the parent 
study (if the subject actually received at least one dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA) or the first dose in the OLS.  
Only descriptive analysis of safety and no statistical testing was planned to be performed.  
Multiplicity control 
Not applicable as no hypothesis test is planned for safety analysis, unless specified otherwise. 
Interim analyses 
Interim analyses (IAs) may take place at any time during the study at the discretion of the sponsor. In 
the event that the parent study is still ongoing, a limited Vertex team may be unblinded to the 
treatment assignments in the parent study for the purpose of reviewing the interim results, and will

not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the parent study to protect the 
integrity of the parent study. 
CHMP comment 
Statistical methods are agreed for this open-label extension study.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 251 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part A, 217 (86.5%) subjects 
completed study drug treatment and 215 (85.7%) subjects completed the study. A total of 84 (33.5%) 
subjects rolled over into Part B. 
Of the 84 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part B, 1 (1.2%) subject completed 
study drug treatment and the study; 81 (96.4%) subjects discontinued treatment and the study due to 
commercial drug availability.

Table 4 Subject Disposition (OL All Subjects Set for Part B) 
CHMP comment 
In Part A, more patients from the control group of Study 104 prematurely discontinued the study 
compared to those who received treatment in Study 104 (20.7% vs 8.5%, respectively). Withdrawal of 
consent (not due to AE) and commercial drug available were the main reasons for this discrepancy.  
In Part B, almost all patients discontinued prematurely due to availability of the commercial drug. As 
such, results for Part A are considered most important for this procedure.  
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 92 study sites in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia and the UK.  
Study initiation: 05 December 2019 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form) 
Study completion: 16 December 2022 (date last subject completed the last visit) 
Conduct of study 
Country-specific amendments to the protocol were prepared for 7 countries (Table 5).

Table 5 Summary of Study 110 Protocol Changes 
On 17 October 2022, the statistical analysis plan (SAP) was amended. Safety analyses for Part B were 
added to SAP version 2.0.  
Vertex implemented safety measures to provide subjects the opportunity to continue participation in 
this study while ensuring their safety by minimizing the risk to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
exposure through travel. Implemented measures included, among others, shipment of study drug from 
site to subject’s home, telephone/video call for safety assessments, in home assessments, and use of 
local laboratories.

Important protocol deviations (IPDs) were defined as any protocol deviation that may significantly 
affect the completeness, accuracy and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a 
subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. IPDs were reported in 6 subjects in Part A, mainly pertaining to 
study conduct/procedures. None of these impacted subject safety or efficacy assessments. There were 
no IPDs in Part B.  
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics in Study 110 were the same as the parent study baseline demographics.

Table 9 Parent Study Baseline Disease Characteristics (OL-FAS Part B) 
CHMP comment 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics are nearly the same as for the parent study. It 
appears that 7 subjects from Study 104 did not participate in Study 110, 5 from the control arm and 2 
from the treatment arm. Slight differences in baseline demographics and characteristics are likely 
caused by the absence of these subjects.  
The mean age in Part A was 37.9 years and 36.3 year in Part B. The number of adolescents is not 
provided. However, in the parent study 9 adolescents were enrolled in the control group and 15 in the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group.  
Number analysed 
The final number of subjects in each analysis set is provided in Table 10 and Table 11.

More detailed results for the efficacy endpoints are discussed below.  
Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1:  
The analysis of absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) 
from baseline is presented in Table 13 and Figure 2. This analysis was conducted with the clinic 
spirometry data only.  
For subjects who received control treatment in Study 104, after initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 110, 
rapid improvements in ppFEV1 were observed and sustained through OL Week 96. The least squares 
(LS) mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from parent study baseline at OL Week 96 was 4.1 percentage 
points (95% CI: 2.5, 5.7).  
For subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 104, improvements in ppFEV1 were sustained through 
OL Week 96. The LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from parent study baseline at OL Week 96 was 
3.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.2, 5.2).

For subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 104, improvements in CFQ-R RD score were 
maintained through OL Week 96. The LS mean absolute change in CFQ-R RD score was 8.1 points 
(95% CI: 5.1, 11.1).

Figure 7 MMRM Analysis of Absolute Change From Parent Study Baseline in CFQ-R RD Score at Each 
Visit Up To OL Week 96 (Study 104 FAS and OL-FAS for Part A) – Clinic and Home Assessed 
CHMP comment 
In the current study, the absolute change in ppFEV1 for subjects who received control treatment in 
Study 104 was comparable to that of patients in the ELX/TEZ/IVA arm of Study 104. During the 96-
week study period, ppFEV1 improvements were stable in both groups. Similar results were obtained for 
the absolute change in SwCl. CFQ-R RD scores decreased slightly over the course of Study 110, but 
were nevertheless considerably higher compared to the baseline of the parent study. Subjects who 
received control treatment during the parent study had a slightly bigger increase in body weight (and 
consequently BMI) than subjects who had received ELX/TEZ/IVA during study 104. The BMI z-score did

not seem to be maintained at the end of the study (>week 60) in subjects that received control 
treatment during the parent study. The Applicant clarified that unlike BMI, BMI z-score was only 
assessed for subjects ≤20 years of age at parent study baseline (n=14 subjects who received control 
treatment in the parent study and n=18 subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in the parent study). At 
open-label Week 60 and all subsequent visits, there were only 6 to 7 non-missing data points for 
subjects who received control treatment in the parent study and 11 to 14 non-missing data points for 
subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in the parent study. Given such small sample sizes, variation in the 
mean change from baseline values is expected, and therefore BMI z-score data in Study VX18-445-110 
should be interpreted with caution. 
Overall, efficacy results obtained in parent study 104 could be replicated and sustained over the full 
96-week study period.  
Safety results 
Safety population 
The safety set (OL Safety Set [OL-SS]) consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug in the OLS. Safety data is provided per study part (OL-SS Part A and OL-SS Part B).  
Exposure 
The OL Safety Set for Part A included 251 subjects who had a mean exposure duration of 89.3 weeks, 
representing 467.1 patient-years of exposure (Table 15) 
Table 15 Summary of Exposure – OL Safety Period (OL-SS Part A)

The OL Safety Set for Part B included 84 subjects who had a mean exposure duration of 22.9 weeks, 
representing 40.1 patient-years of exposure (Table 16). The majority of subjects discontinued 
treatment and the study due to commercial drug availability. 
Table 16 Summary of Exposure – OL Safety Period (OL-SS Part B) 
Adverse events 
In Study 110 Part A, 241 (96.0%) subjects had at least 1 AE and 38 (15.1%) had at least 1 serious 
AE (SAE). See Table 17.  
The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity. Overall, 20 (8.0%) subjects 
had 1 or more severe AEs, 2 (0.8%) subjects had a life-threatening AE, and there was 1 death due to 
an AE of colon cancer that was assessed as unlikely related to study drug. Seventeen (6.8%) subjects 
interrupted ELX/TEZ/IVA due to AEs, and 13 (5.2%) subjects discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA due to AEs.

Table 17 Overview of AEs – OL Safety Period (OL-SS Part A) 
In Study 110 Part B, 62 (73.8%) subjects had at least 1 AE and 3 (3.6%) had at least 1 SAE; no SAE 
was assessed as related to study drug. See Table 18.  
The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild (31.0%) or moderate (41.7%) in severity (Table 
14.3.1.1b). Overall, 1 (1.2%) subject had a severe AE. There were no deaths, or AEs that led to study 
drug interruption or discontinuation.

Table 18 Overview of AEs – OL Safety Period (OL-SS Part B) 
CHMP comment 
The percentage of subjects with any AE as well as Grade 3/4 AEs, related AEs and SAEs was higher in 
Part A of the study than in Part B. There were also more AEs related to study drug in Part A. This 
difference may be due to the large number of patients who discontinued treatment in Part B.  
The percentage of subjects with AEs is considerably higher than in the parent study. In the parent 
study, 66.7% of the subjects in the treatment arm and 65.9% in the control arm had an AE, while this 
frequency increased to 96% in Study 110. In the treatment arm of the parent study, 3.8% of the AEs 
were Grade 3/4, 24.2% were considered related, and 3.8% were SAEs, compared to 8.8%, 37.8% and 
15.1% respectively in Study 110. However, the parent study had a treatment period of only 8 weeks, 
so higher percentages of AEs in Study 110 are not unexpected. The safety pattern is comparable to 
that observed in other long-term safety studies.   
Common Adverse Events 
Table 19 shows all AEs that occurred in at least 10% of subjects in Study 110 Part A, summarised by 
PT. Most common AEs were headache, infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF, cough, and COVID-19.  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/297123/2023  
Page 30/39 
  
 
 
 
 
Table 19 AEs With an Incidence ≥10% by PT (OL-SS Part A) 
AEs that occurred in at least 10% of subjects in Study 110 Part B were COVID-19 and infective 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF, which both occurred in 17 subjects (20.2%).  
CHMP comment 
Overall, AEs were consistent with common manifestations or CF disease, common illnesses in CF 
subjects 12 years of age and older, or the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. In general, frequencies 
are somewhat higher than in parent study 104, but this may be caused by the longer treatment period.  
Quite a large number of subjects experienced anxiety (28 [11.2%] in Part A) during study 110. Of 
these 28 events, 9 (3.6%) were considered possibly related and 2 (0.8%) related. AEs of anxiety were 
not seen during the initial marketing authorisation, while in parent study 104, only one subject in the 
control arm had an AE of anxiety. In an ongoing procedure (EMEA/H/C/005269/X/0033/G), the 
Applicant is requested to monitor and analyse psychiatric-related AEs in the PSURs for all age groups.  
Severity of Adverse Events 
In Part A, the majority of subjects had AEs that were mild (32.3%) or moderate (55.0%) in severity 
(Table 17). Overall, 20 (8.0%) subjects had 1 or more severe AEs, and 2 (0.8%) had a life-threatening 
AE. One life-threatening AE was a spontaneous pneumothorax, while the other one was colon cancer. 
Both were considered not to be related to ELX/TEZ/IVA by the investigator.  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/297123/2023  
Page 31/39 
  
 
 
 
In Part B, there was only one severe AE (1.2%), all others were either mild (31.0%) or moderate 
(41.7%).  
Relationship of Adverse Events 
Overall, 17 (6.8%) subjects of Part A had an AE assessed by the investigator as related, and 78 
(31.1%) subjects had an AE assessed by the investigator as possibly related (Table 17). AEs 
designated as related or possibly related that occurred in ≥3% of subjects were blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased (6.0%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (4.0%), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) increased (4.0%), rash (4.0%) and anxiety (4.4%).  
In Part B, 1 (1.2%) subject had an AE assessed by the investigator as related. 
Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events 
There was 1 AE of colon cancer leading to death in Part A. This event was considered unlikely related 
to study drug. There were 38 (15.1%) subjects who had at least 1 SAE. SAEs occurring in ≥2 subjects 
in the OLS are presented in Table 20. Two subjects had related SAEs; 1 subject had SAEs of ALT 
increased (0.4%) and AST increased (0.4%), and the second subject had an SAE of suicidal ideation 
(0.4%).   
Table 20 SAEs Occurring in ≥2 Subjects in the OLS by PT (OL-SS Part A) 
Part B: There were no deaths. Three (3.6%) subjects had at least 1 SAE, which were pulmonary 
exacerbation, acute anterior chest pain with unknown aetiology, angiolipoma, neausea and vomiting, 
all occuring in only one subject. Of these, only the angiolipoma was considered possibly related.  
CHMP comment 
Overall, related AEs and SAEs were consistent with common CF manifestations and complications, the 
parent study and the known safety profile for ELX/TEZ/IVA (except for the AE of anxiety, which is 
discussed above). It is agreed that the event of colon cancer leading to death is unlikely related to 
study drug.

Study Drug Discontinuation 
Overall, 13 (5.2%) subjects in Part A had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation in ≥2 subjects were liver-related events (including alanine transaminase ALT 
increased in 4 [1.6%] subjects, AST increased in 3 [1.2%] subjects, and blood bilirubin increased in 3 
[1.2%] subjects), anxiety (2 [0.8%] subjects), and insomnia (2 [0.8%] subjects). 
In Part B, no subjects had AEs that led to study drug discontinuation.  
Adverse Events That Led to Interruption of Study Drug 
In Part A, 17 (6.8%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption. AEs leading to treatment 
interruption occurring in at least 2 subjects were ALT increased (7 subjects), AST increased (7 
subjects), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (3 subjects), gamma glutamyltransferase increased 
(2 subjects), and diarrhoea (2 subjects).  
In Part B, no subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption.  
CHMP comment 
The number of subjects who had AEs leading to drug interruption is comparable to what was seen 
during the initial marketing authorisation. However, there were slightly more treatment 
discontinuations due to AEs during study 110 (5.2%) compared with the studies of the initial procedure 
(where a maximum of 1.4% of subjects discontinued study drug). This difference is considered 
acceptable, considering the longer treatment duration and the fact that AEs leading to discontinuation 
were known AEs of ELX/TEZ/IVA (with the exception of anxiety, which was discussed above).  
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Elevated Transaminase Events 
In Part A, 17 subjects (6.8%) had at least 1 elevated transaminase event. Both ALT increased and 
AST increased occurred in 16 subjects (6.4%) each. The majority of events were mild or moderate in 
severity, whereas three events (1.2%) were severe. Elevated transaminases led to treatment 
discontinuation in 4 subjects (1.6%) and to treatment interruption in 8 subjects (3.2%).  
Similar results were seen in Part B.  
Rash Events 
In Part A, 29 (11.6%) subjects had a rash event. The majority of events were mild or moderate in 
severity; one event was severe. No subject had a rash event that led to treatment discontinuation, and 
2 (0.8%) subjects had a rash event that led to treatment interruption. One (0.4%) subject had a 
serious rash event (SAE of rash erythematous that resolved with treatment).  
By sex, 18/124 female subjects (14.5%) and 11/127 male subjects (8.7%) had rash events. In female 
subjects, 6/42 subjects (14.3%) who used hormonal therapy and 12/82 subjects (14.6%) not using 
hormonal therapy had rash events. 
There were no rash events in Part B.  
CHMP comment 
Elevated transaminases and rash are known AEs of ELX/TEZ/IVA. During the initial marketing 
application, a higher incidence of rash was seen in female subjects taking hormonal therapy compared 
with those not taking hormonal therapy in the ELX/TEZ/IVA arm. This trend was not observed in Study

104 and is also not seen in the current study. Hence, there are no new insights in the AESIs of 
elevated transaminases and rash.

Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Chemistry (Part A) 
Liver function tests (LFTs) are described above (see AESI elevated transaminase described above). 
There were no trends in mean values of other non-LFT chemistry parameters and no clinically 
significant trends in creatine kinase concentration levels were seen.  
Haematology (Part A) 
There were no trends observed in haematology parameters. AEs related to haematology were 
infrequent (PTs occurred in 1 to 2 subjects each), not serious and did not lead to treatment 
discontinuation or interruption.  
Coagulation (Part A) 
There were no trends or AEs related to coagulation assessments.  
Urinalysis (Part A) 
There were no trends in urinalysis results. AEs related to urinalysis were infrequent (most PTs occurred 
in 1 to 2 subjects each), not serious and did not lead to treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
Vital signs (Part A) 
The mean (SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased from baseline through OL Week 96 by 
2.6 (13.2) and 2.5 (9.4) mm HG, respectively. The mean pulse rate was variable over time. No 
subjects had AEs of decreased pulse rate. There were no trends in temperature, respiratory rate or 
pulse oximetry.  
ECG (Part A) 
The mean heart rate (HR) was variable over time, but consistent with pulse rate findings. The mean 
decreases in HR ranged from -0.3 to -1.7 beats per minute. No subject had AEs of HR decreased. 
There were no trends observed in other ECG parameters. AEs related to ECG findings or relevant 
cardiac disorders were infrequent (majority of PTs occurred in 1 to 2 subjects each). There were two 
cardiac disorder SAEs (i.e. atrial fibrillation and palpitations), but those were assessed as not related 
and did not lead to treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
Ophthalmologic Examinations (Part A) 
There were two mild, nonserious and possibly related AEs (one cataract and one lenticular opacities). 
No treatment was required.  
Overall, laboratory findings in Part B were consistent with or less frequent/severe than in Part A of the 
study.  
CHMP comment 
In general, clinical laboratory findings are in line with those observed in the parent study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Kaftrio obtained approval by the EMA on 21 August 2020. Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen 
with ivacaftor for the treatment of CF in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del 
mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The MAH now

submitted the results of a stand-alone study, Study VX18-445-110 (“110”), as per requirement of 
Article 46 of the “Paediatric Regulation” (EC) 1901/2006.  
Study 110 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study (OLS) in subjects with CF 12 years of age and 
older, heterozygous for F508del and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF genotypes), 
who completed Study VX18-445-104 (Study 104). The study consisted of two parts: Part A (96 weeks 
Treatment Period) and, in certain countries, Part B (48 weeks Treatment Period), followed by a 4-week 
Safety Follow-up Period. During the Treatment Period, patients received standard ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment as described in the SmPC. In- and exclusion criteria were the same as for parent Study 104 
and thus considered acceptable.  
Primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA based on 
adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry. This endpoint is 
appropriate for an open-label extension study. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in 
efficacy measures, such as ppFEV1, SwCl, body measures and CFQ-R RD scores, which are considered 
relevant outcome measures for CF treatment.  
A total of 251 patients were included in Part A (250 subjects were planned), of these, 84 patients 
rolled-over to Part B. Only 1 of these 84 subjects completed the study; 81 subjects (96.4%) 
discontinued treatment and the study due to the availability of the commercial drug. As such, results 
for Part A are considered most important for this procedure. The mean age in Part A was 37.9 years 
(including approximately 14 adolescents) and 36.3 year in Part B. 
Efficacy results (only Part A) were generally in line with those observed in the parent study. Subjects 
who received control treatment during Study 104 had comparable changes in efficacy measures as 
those who received ELX/TEZ/IVA during the parent study. In addition, efficacy parameters were 
relatively stable during the 96-week study period. However, while the absolute change in body weight 
and BMI increased over the course of the study, the BMI z-score did not seem to be maintained at the 
end of the study (>week 60) in subjects that received control treatment during the parent study. The 
Applicant clarified that BMI z- score was, unlike BMI, only assessed for a small subgroup of patients ≤ 
20 years. From week 60 onwards there were only very few nonmissing data points available. Hence, 
BMI z-score data in Study 110 should be interpreted with caution.  
Adverse events were generally mild or moderate in severity. There were two life-threatening AEs and 
one AE leading to death in Part A, but these were considered unrelated to the study drug. Most 
common AEs were headache, infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF, cough, and COVID-19, which all 
occurred in more than 20% of the subjects. AEs leading to study drug interruption or discontinuation 
were rare and mainly liver-related events. Frequencies of AEs, Grade 3/4 AEs, related AEs and SAEs 
were higher compared with the parent study. This likely reflects the longer treatment duration in Study 
110 (96 weeks vs. 8 weeks in the parent study). The safety profile is generally consistent with other 
open-label extensions studies. Quite a large number of subjects experienced anxiety (28 [11.2%] in 
Part A) compared to previous studies. In an ongoing procedure (EMEA/H/C/005269/X/0033/G), a 
request for post-approval follow-up of the AE of anxiety was already demanded. There were no new 
insights in the AESIs of elevated transaminases and rash. However, in general, AEs were consistent 
with common manifestations and complications of CF disease in subjects 12 years of age and older, or 
the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
Conclusion 
The benefit-risk evaluation of Kaftrio remains positive. No new safety signals have been observed in 
Study 110 and results for secondary efficacy endpoints are also in line with previous studies. No 
update of the product information is considered needed at present.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The benefit-risk evaluation of Kaftrio remains positive.  No new safety signals have been observed in 
CF patients aged 12 years and older with F/G and F/RF genotypes treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 
110. No update of the product information is considered needed at present.

4.  Request for supplementary information  
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
Other concern 
1.  While the absolute change in body weight and BMI increased over the course of Study 110, the 
BMI z-score did not seem to be maintained at the end of the study (>week 60) in subjects that 
received control treatment during the parent study. The Applicant is asked to give potential 
explanations for these results.  
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Unlike BMI, which was assessed in all subjects, BMI z-score was only assessed for subjects ≤20 years 
of age at parent study baseline (N = 14 subjects who received control treatment in the parent study 
and N = 18 subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in the parent study). See Table 1 for details.

As shown above in Table 1, at open-label Week 60 and all subsequent visits, there were only 6 to 7 
nonmissing data points for subjects who received control treatment in the parent study and 11 to 14 
nonmissing data points for subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in the parent study. Given such small 
sample sizes, variation in the mean change from baseline values is expected, and therefore BMI z-
score data in Study VX18-445-110 should be interpreted with caution. Overall, the BMI z-score data 
are consistent for subjects who received control treatment in the parent study, in the context of the 
wide and overlapping 95% CIs at all visits. 
Rapporteur’s assessment 
The clarification of the Applicant, i.e. that BMI z-score was analysed in a small subset of patients and 
that there were only few non-missing data points from week 60 onwards is acknowledged. It is agreed 
that BMI z-score data in Study 110 should be interpreted with caution. As such, no firm conclusions 
could be drawn based on the curves from week 60 onwards. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  The assessment report is updated accordingly.

1.  Introduction 
On 01 March 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for NOXAFIL, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that “PN 097: A study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous 
(IV) and powder for oral suspension formulations of posaconazole (POS) in immunocompromised 
paediatric subjects with neutropenia or expected neutropenia” is a part of a clinical development 
program (paediatric). 
The MAH proposes no amendments to the Product Information (PI) for Noxafil (posaconazole) based on 
study PN097 results at this point of time. 
Study PN097 was a phase 1b study to evaluate safety and PK of two formulations used sequentially: 
concentrate for solution for infusion (infusion) and a new paediatric oral formulation, Powder for Oral 
Suspension (PFS) for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised paediatric 
patients with neutropenia or expected neutropenia aged 2 to less than 18 years of age.  
Because the development of the PFS is ongoing, the MAH considers that updating the PI with PN097 
clinical data while the PFS formulation is not yet available, would not be helpful and could potentially 
be confusing to the prescriber. This would especially be relevant in situations when transitioning 
paediatric patients from intravenous to an oral formulation, where the Oral Suspension (approved for 
adult use only) would potentially be prescribed at an incorrect dose. 
To avoid any confusion, the MAH intends to update the PI via a Type II variation combined with a line 
extension to the Marketing Authorisation of Noxafil for the PFS.  
In parallel, the MAH is engaging with EMA/PDCO to discuss PK results from PN097 study, in particular 
the context of the dose selection of posaconazole infusion and the PFS for a treatment study for 
invasive fungal infections in paediatric patients aged from 2 to less than 18 years of age (study 
PN104). The study PN104 will further inform on the dose, safety and efficacy of posaconazole in 
paediatric patients. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Three POS formulations were developed and received marketing approval for use in adults, including 
an oral suspension (OS), a gastro-resistant tablet (hereafter referred to as tablet formulation), and a 
concentrate for solution for infusion (IV) formulation. 
The pediatric clinical development of POS has been ongoing, with the goal to identify a dosing regimen 
of IV and oral POS in pediatrics that would achieve the exposures of POS associated with efficacy and 
safety in adult patients when taking POS IV or tablet. The PK target for POS established through the 
adult development program was a geometric mean Cavg of approximately 1200 ng/mL, with 
approximately 90% of subjects with steady-state Cavg at least 500 ng/mL. A prior pediatric study 
(P032) in pediatric subjects aged 3 months to <18 years of age demonstrated that POS exposures 
EMA/507864/2019  
Page 3/46 
 
 
  
 
 
comparable to those associated with efficacy and safety in adults administered POS IV or tablet could 
not be achieved in the pediatric population with the current POS OS formulation.  
The POS tablet formulation demonstrated improved oral bioavailability over the OS in adults; however, 
the current POS oral tablet is too large to be easily swallowed by young children and does not allow for 
weight-based dosing. Therefore, the MAH developed the POS PFS, which consists of the same 
extrudate material/intermediate developed for the POS tablet. 
POS PFS is an oral suspension, to be prepared from sachets containing powdr and (mixing liquid) for 
oral administration. POS PFS was developed as a more age-appropriate and dose-flexible oral 
formulation for pediatric patients, while potentially offering similar benefits of improved absorption and 
PK as the POS tablet used in adults. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
PN097: A study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) and powder for 
oral suspension formulations of posaconazole (POS) in immunocompromised paediatric subjects with 
neutropenia or expected neutropenia. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
PN097: A study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) and powder for 
oral suspension formulations of posaconazole (POS) in immunocompromised paediatric subjects with 
neutropenia or expected neutropenia.

CHMP comments 
This was a phase 1B, non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, sequential dose-escalation study : this 
study design is acceptable to meet  meet the  primary and secondary objectives in  order to assess PK 
and safety data with two formulations of posaconazole, the intravenous infusion formulation (IV POS)  
and  the  PFS  POS  (Powder  for  Oral  Suspension  Formulation)  that  is  currently  developed  for  pediatric 
population. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 84 subjects was planned to be enrolled, including a minimum of 24 subjects (12 in each age 
group) in dose cohorts #1 and #2, and 36 (12 in each age group and an additional 12 across both age 
groups) in dose cohort #3. 
As of the data cutoff date for this report (final data), 118 subjects were enrolled: 16, 15, and 20 in 
dose cohorts #1, #2, and #3 in Age Group 1 and 21, 17, and 29 in dose cohorts #1, #2, and #3 in 
Age Group 2. 
Subject Inclusion Criteria 
1) Be a child or adolescent of either sex and of any race, 2 to 17 years of age at the time of screening.

Sexually active females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test which 
must be followed up with a confirmed negative serum pregnancy test (β-HCG) within 48 hours 
following the screening visit. 
* Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is 
consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by 
local regulatory agencies and ERCs/IRBs. 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
‡ If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not 
qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this 
country/region. 
Subject Exclusion Criteria

CHMP comments 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size are acceptable. 
Treatments 
The subject population will be divided into 2 age groups. 
Age Group 1 will be Young Children, who are aged 2 years to <7 years of age, and Age Group 2 will be 
Adolescents/Older Children, who are aged 7 to 17 years of age. 
The two formulations will be studied in all subjects in a sequential manner (POS IV solution, followed 
by POS PFS formulation). There will be two pre-specified dosage cohorts in this study. The decision to 
move to the next dose cohort (Dose Cohort #2) may be done independent of complete enrollment of 
the other age group. 
The two age groups (Young Children [ages 2 - < 7 years; Age Group 1]; Adolescents/Older children [7 
to 17 years; Age Group 2]) will enroll simultaneously: 
• Age Group 1: Young Children (minimum of 24 subjects, age 2 to <7 years) 
• Dose Cohort #1: A minimum of 12 subjects will receive POS IV solution at 3.5 mg/kg (3.5 mg/kg IV 
BID on Day 1, then 3.5 mg/kg IV once daily on Days 2-10). Thereafter subjects will either proceed to 
POS PFS at 3.5 mg/kg once daily or continue on POS IV solution, if they are unwilling or unable to 
tolerate POS PFS. 
• Dose Cohort #2: A minimum of 12 subjects will receive POS IV solution at 4.5 mg/kg (4.5 mg/kg IV 
BID on Day 1, then 4.5 mg/kg IV once daily on Days 2-10). Thereafter subjects will either proceed to 
POS PFS at 4.5 mg/kg once daily or continue on POS IV solution if they are unwilling or unable to 
tolerate POS PFS. 
Age Group 2: Adolescents/Older Children) (minimum of 24 subjects, age 7 to 17 years) 
• Dose Cohort #1: A minimum of 12 subjects will receive POS IV solution at 3.5 mg/kg (3.5 mg/kg IV 
BID on Day 1, then 3.5 mg/kg IV once daily on Days 2-10). Thereafter subjects will either proceed to 
POS PFS at 3.5 mg/kg once daily or continue on POS IV solution if they are unwilling or unable to 
tolerate POS PFS. 
EMA/507864/2019

• Dose Cohort #2: A minimum of 12 subjects will receive POS IV solution at 4.5 mg/kg (4.5 mg/kg IV 
BID on Day 1, then 4.5 mg/kg IV once daily on Days 2-10). Thereafter subjects will either proceed to 
POS PFS at 4.5 mg/kg once daily or continue on POS IV solution if they are unwilling or unable to 
tolerate POS PFS. 
The current study includes the option for dose escalation to ensure that target exposures are achieved, 
should the 3.5 mg/kg/day starting dose be found to result in suboptimal exposures. 
If the 3.5 mg/kg/day dose of either the IV solution or OGS formulation of POS does not meet the PK 
target of both formulations but has an acceptable safety profile within a specific age group, the dose 
will be escalated in a second cohort to 4.5 mg/kg/day in the same age group. 
Doses in each age group and each formulation are planned to escalate independently. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: The plasma pharmacokinetics profile [AUC, Cmax, Cmin, and Cavg] following 
administration of POS IV solution and POS OGS will be summarized by age group and dose cohort.  
Secondary endpoints: Safety parameters will be summarized for each age group and dose cohort. 
EMA/507864/2019  
Page 9/46 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Additional Endpoints 
Palatability and acceptability parameters for the new POS OGS formulation will be assessed in all 
subjects. 
In addition, the PK of sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBEβCD) will also be assessed as an 
exploratory objective while on POS IV solution. 
There are no efficacy endpoints for this study. 
CHMP comments 
Acceptable 
Statistical Methods 
All results are descriptive in nature. There was no formal hypothesis testing in this study. 
Pharmacokinetics:  A  non-compartmental  PK  analysis  (NCA)  was  applied  for  the  primary  PK  
population, defined as all treated subjects who received at least 7 days of POS IV solution (for the IV 
PK  analysis)  and  7  days  of  POS  PFS  therapy  (for  the  PFS  PK  analysis)  and  completed  full  POS  PK 
sampling.  Non-compartmental  analysis  of  POS  concentration-time  profiles  was  used  to  determine 
Cmax,  Tmax,  Cmin,  Cavg,  AUC,  CL,  and  CL/F  using  PhoenixTM  (WinNonlin®  6.4).  These  PK 
parameters were then summarized using descriptive statistics. A population PK analysis was conducted 
to  characterize  POS  PK  and  assess  potential  covariates  following  both  POS  IV  solution  and  POS  PFS 
administration and is reported separately. 
Safety: All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses. 
CHMP comments 
NCA PK parameters calculation is well explained and justified.  
To note NCA approach will be used to estimate PK parameters following the use of the IV formulation. 
For  the  PFS  formulation,  the  MAH  stated  that  PK  parameters  of  interest  will  be  derived  using  a 
Population  PK  model.  In  addition  the  MAH  stated  that  a  population  PK  analysis  was  conducted  to 
characterize POS PK and assess potential covariates following both POS IV and PFS formulation and is 
reported separately. However none of both reports were found in the dossier.  
The MAH is requested to provide them (or it) 
Bioanalytical Methods 
Two bioanalytical methods were developed to quantify POS and SBECD in human plasma. 
Posaconazole 
POS  was  quantified  in  human  K2  EDTA  plasma  using  a  validated  liquid  chromatography  with  tandem 
mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Briefly a 50 µL matrix aliquot is fortified with 20 µL of 3 µg/mL of 
Posaconazole-d4  as  internal  standard.  The  analytes  are  isolated  through  solid phase  extraction  using 
Water Oasis MCX 10-mg, 96-well SPE plates and eluted with 100 µL of methanol/ammonium hydroxide 
(95:5  v/v).  The  eluate  is  evaporate  under  a  nitrogen  stream,  and  the  remaining  residue  is 
reconstituted with 100 µL of water/acetonitrile/acetic acid (60:40:0.1, v/v/v) and injected in the UPLC-
MS/MS system. 
A summary of the developed method is provided in Table 1. The calibration range consisted of 8 levels 
from  5  to  5000  ng/mL  with  5  QC  levels  15/40/150/600/3750  ng/mL  which  cover  the  entire 
EMA/507864/2019

measurement  interval.  Accuracy,  precision,  selectivity,  reproducibility,  recovery,  carry-over  and 
stability have been validated with satisfactory results. Long term stability is demonstrated at 932 days 
stored at -20°C. 
A sufficient number of chromatograms have been provided. ISR met the acceptance criteria (99.2%) 
Table 1: Method validation summary 
EMA/507864/2019  
Page 11/46 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
SBECD (Cyclodextrine) 
SBECD  was  quantified  in  human  K3  EDTA  plasma  using  a  validated  high  performance  liquid 
chromatography  (HPLC)  method.  Briefly  the  analyte  cyclodextrin  and  its  internal  standard  gamma-
cyclodextrin were extracted using an automated protein precipitation extraction from a 50 µL aliquot of 
human plasma. The extracted samples were injected into a HPLC system. 
A summary of the developed method is provided in Table 2. The calibration range consisted of 8 levels 
from  1  to  250  µg/mL  with  4  QC  levels  1/3/125/187.5  µg/mL  which  cover  the  entire  measurement 
interval.  Accuracy,  precision,  selectivity,  reproducibility,  recovery,  matrix  effect,  carry-over  and 
stability have been validated with satisfactory results. Long term stability is demonstrated at 315 days 
stored at -80°C. 
A sufficient number of chromatograms have been provided. ISR met the acceptance criteria (100%).

CHMP comments 
Generally,  based  on  the  validation  reports,  the  used  bioanalytical  methods  developed  for  the 
quantification  of  POS  and  SBECD,  in  human  plasma  comply  with  acceptance  criteria  regarding 
accuracy,  precision,  selectivity,  reproducibility,  recovery,  dilution  integrity,  carry  over.  Analytical 
validation reports were provided with satisfactory results. 
Long  term  stability  is  demonstrated  at  932  days  stored  at  -20°C  for  POS  and  315  days  for  SBEBCD 
stored at -80°C. 
To note POS was collected in K2EDTA as anticoagulant whereas SBECD in K3EDTA. However the MAH 
demonstrated that similar results were obtained with both anticoagulant, this is acceptable. 
Sufficient  chromatograms  were  provided  by  the  MAH.  99.2  %  and  100%  of  the  ISR  for  POS  and 
SBEBCD respectively met the acceptance criteria.

CHMP comments 
The groups were generally well balanced for baseline characteristics: age weight, baseline disease. 
Disposition of Participants 
A total of 29 sites were open for enrollment of which 24 centers in 11 countries enrolled at least one 
subject. 
A total of 126 subjects were screened of which 118 were enrolled in the study. Eight subjects were 
screened and did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria. 
Of the 118 subjects enrolled, 115 subjects were dosed, 2 subjects were deemed as screen failures 
after enrollment, and one subject’s parent/guardian withdrew consent. 
Of the 118 enrolled subjects, 109 (92.4%) completed the study. The number/proportion of subjects 
who withdrew from the study were generally similar across dose cohorts in both age groups. 
Of the 115 subjects dosed with POS IV, 89 (77.4%) completed treatment. Of the 63 subjects who 
transitioned to POS PFS, 52 (82.5%) completed treatment [Table 10-1]. The number/proportion of 
subjects who discontinued study treatment was generally similar across dose cohorts in both age 
groups [16.2.1] with the exception of Age Group 2 of the POS IV 4.5 mg/kg cohort and Age Group 1 of 
the POS PFS 6 mg/kg cohort. The rate of treatment discontinuation for POS IV Age Group 2 subjects in 
the 4.5 mg/kg cohort was lower (0%) than in other age/dose groups (10% to 35.7%). The rate of 
treatment discontinuation for POS PFS Age Group 1 subjects in the 6 mg/kg cohort was higher (50%) 
than in the other age/dose cohorts (0% to 16.7%). 
A survival assessment was completed for all subjects between Day 90 and 110.  Overall, 4 subjects (2 
subjects in Age Group 1, and 2 subjects in Age Group 2) died during the study period. A subject listing 
of the 4 deaths is provided in [16.2.7.1.4]. The Day 100 survival status was >90% for all groups.

Extent of Exposure 
The mean overall treatment duration (POS IV and POS PFS) of all treated subjects was 20.6 days with 
a range of 1 to 28 days  
The mean duration of exposure to POS IV treatment was 14.3 days with a range of 1 to 28 days. Of 
the 115 subjects dosed with IV solution, 109 (94.8%) received at least 7 days of therapy. 
The mean duration of exposure to POS PFS treatment was 11.6 days with a range of 2 to 18 days 
[Table 10-8]. Of the 63 subjects who transitioned to POS PFS, 57 (90.5%) received at least 7 days of 
therapy. 
Clinical pharmacology 
The pediatric clinical development of POS has been ongoing, with the goal to identify a dosing regimen 
of IV and oral POS in paediatrics that would achieve the exposure of POS associated with efficacy and 
safety  in  adults  when  taking  POS  IV  or  tablet.  The  PK  target  for  POS  established  through  the  adult 
development  program  was  a  geometric  mean  of  Cavg  of  approximately  1200  ng/mL,  with 
approximately 90% of subjects with steady state Cavg at least of 500 ng/mL. 
In study P097 two formulations were used. A known IV formulation and a developed new formulation 
named PFS, an oral suspension which consists of the same extrudate materiel/intermediate developed 
for the POS tablet. POS PFS is an oral suspension, to be prepared from sachets containing powder  for 
oral  administration.  POS  PFS  was  developed  as  a  more  age-appropriate  and  dose-flexible  oral 
formulation for paediatrics. 
Pharmacokinetic Study design 
Three  sequential  weight-based  cohorts  (3.5,  4.5  and  6.0  mg/kg/day)  were  studied  with  the  goal  of 
identifying  a  dose  in  this  pediatric  population  that  achieves  systemic  POS  exposures  similar  to  those 
found  to  be  associated  with  efficacy  in  adults.  Subjects  received  10  to  28  days  of  POS  IV  with  the 
option to switch to PFS after 10 days. 
PK sampling consisted: 
- 
IV formulation:  
  Day 6, Pre-dose 
  Day 7: Full PK sampling, with Pre-dose, 1h post-start of infusion, and approximately at 4, 
6, 12, 24h 
- 
PFS formulation (begin at Day 15) 
  Day 20, Day 25 and Day 26 Pre-dose 
  Day  24: full PK sampling, with Pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24h 
In  addition  to  POS,  cyclodextrin  (or  known  as  SBECD  sulfobutyle  ether  β-cyclodextrine)  an  excipient 
used for the IV formulation will be also quantify in plasma samples at sampling time points similar to 
that of the IV formulation.

Pharmacokinetic Study Results 
Primary PK endpoint 
The PK of POS IV solution and POS PFS were characterized in immunocompromised pediatric subjects 
(ages  2  to  17  years)  with  neutropenia  or expected  neutropenia  in  P097.  Within  this  study,  a  total  of 
118  subjects  were  enrolled,  of  which  115  received  at  least  1  dose  of  POS  IV  and  of  these,  63 
subsequently received at least 1 dose of POS PFS. Subjects were included in the PK analysis population 
if  they  received  at  least  7  days  of  POS  therapy,  completed  the  full  POS  PK  sampling,  and  met  pre-
specified  Patient  Acceptability  Criteria.  Based  on  these  criteria,  the  PK  analysis  population  included  a 
total of 100 subjects for the IV treatment and 50 subjects for the PFS treatment. Two age groups were 
assessed, Group 1 (2 to < 7 years of age) and Group 2 (7 to 17 years of age). 
Data exclusion 
From the 115 subjects enrolled in the IV cohort and 63 in PFS cohort, 15 and 13 were dropped since: 
-  Samples were not collected or PK concentrations not obtained 9/15 and 10/13 
-  Dose was not given within 6 hours of the scheduled time 5/15 and 3/13 
-  Outlier exclusion 1/15 
Missing PK samples 
Several  subjects  in  the  PFS  treatment  group  were  missing  the  24h  PK  sample.  Without  a  24h  PK 
sample, AUC0-24h and Cave calculations are not possible. However based on the assumption that SS 
PK concentration are achieved by Day 7, the pre-dose samples were taken to be equivalent to the 24h 
PK sample and applied to support estimation of the AUC0-24h (and Cavg). 10 subjects were impacted. 
Results summary 
A  summary  of  plasma  steady-state  PK  parameter  values  of  POS  are  provided  in  Table  3.  Target 
attainment is presented in Table 4. 
Based  on  Table  3,  Geometric  mean  CL  after  IV  administration  and  CL/F  after  PFS  administration 
appeared to be independent of dose level, but both were lower in the younger subjects (Age Group 1) 
compared  to  older  subjects  (Age  Group  2)  across  all  dose  groups.  As  expected,  apparent  clearance 
after PFS administration was higher than clearance after IV administration confirming that the PFS, like 
other oral POS formulations, is not fully bioavailable. There were no consistent trends in the variability 
of CL and CL/F across dose level, age group, or formulation.

 
The target PK exposure of approximately 90% of subjects with Cavg within 500 and 2500 
ng/mL was attained only in Age Group 2 with both formulations.

  1 subject have a Cave over 2500 ng/mL in the Age Group 2 by IV formulation 
-  4.5 mg/kg/day cohort: 
  Geometric mean Cavg values were 1070 and 1240 ng/mL for IV, and 901 and 1200 ng/mL 
for the PFS formulation, for Age Groups 1 and 2 respectively. 
 
The target PK exposure of approximately 90% of subjects with Cavg within 500 and 2500 
ng/mL was attained for the two Groups with both formulations. 
  1 subject have a Cavg over 2500 ng/mL in the Age Group 2 by IV formulation 
-  6 mg/kg/day cohort: 
  Geometric mean Cavg values were 1300 and 1840 ng/mL for IV, and 960 and 1040 ng/mL 
for the PFS formulation, for Age Groups 1 and 2 respectively. 
 
The target PK exposure of approximately 90% of subjects with Cavg over 500 ng/mL was 
attained in 100% of younger subjects and 94% of older subjects (combined IV and PFS). 
  2 and 6 subjects have Cavg over 2500 ng/mL in the Age Group 1 and 2 respectively by IV 
formulation 
  2 subjects have a Cavg over 2500 ng/mL in the Age Group 2 by PFS formulation 
Overall for subjects which have a Cavg over 2500 ng/mL, according to the MAH no correlation between 
drug related AEs and POS exposures was observed  for either the POS IV or POS PFS formulations as 
shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively.

CHMP comments 
POS PK have been adequately characterized after both IV and PFS administration.  
Data exclusion and missing samples have been adequately handled. However it should be noted that 
PK parameters calculation suffers of many PK data imputation, not only for the PFS arm as claimed by 
the MAH, and this is expected when using NCA approach. The use of a Population PK modelling remain 
a more reliable approach to estimate PK parameters of interest, this have been performed according to 
the MAH but the report have not been found. 
PK  results  of  this  study  clearly  show  that  the  PK  target  (90%  of  subjects  with  steady  state  Cavg  at 
least of 500 ng/mL) is reached with both the 4.5 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg cohort whatever the age group. 
This  implicitly  suggest  to  support  the  use  of  a  weight  based  dosing  for  POS  in  the  paediatric 
population. 
Exploratory Pharmacokinetic Endpoint(s). 
The PK of SBEBCD were characterized at steady state following administration of POS IV solution. The 
same  IV  formulation  was  used  throughout  the  study  so  the  amount  of  SBEBCD  was  directly 
proportional to the total dose of POS that each subject received. A summary of SBEBCD PK is provided 
in  Table  5.  At  steady-state  after  IV  administration,  SBEBCD  PK  were  highly  variable  but  exposure 
increased  with  increasing  POS  dose  and  was  generally  similar  in  both  age  groups  within  each  dose 
cohort.

CHMP comments 
SBEBCD PK have been adequately characterized after IV administration.  
The  MAH  stated  that  SBEBCD  was  generally  similar  in  both  age  groups  within  each  dose  cohort. 
However it could be observed, particularly in the Age Group 1 (2 to < 7 years), that as dose increase 
from 3.5 to 6 mg/kg, mean terminal half-life increase from 1.71h to 2.58h. This is of particular interest 
with regards to the safety data (more adverse events in the IV vs PFS arm) and results from the target 
attainment (for both 4.5 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg the target is reached in the younger). 
Therefore the MAH is asked to provide an exposure safety analysis with PK data from SBEBCD as input.

Efficacy results 
P097 was a PK and safety study; there was no formal efficacy analysis. 
EMA/507864/2019  
Page 25/46 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy 
This was a phase 1 PK and safety study; there was no formal efficacy analysis. As POS was given for 
prophylaxis of IFI in this study, AEs consistent with IFI are of particular interest as a surrogate marker 
of efficacy.  
Two of 115 treated subjects (1.7%) experienced AEs consistent with possible or probable IFIs during 
the study period. Both subjects were in Age Group 2 of the 4.5 mg/kg dose cohort. 
 One subject experienced an AE of systemic mycosis, with onset on Day 11 as fever of unknown origin 
with computed tomography scan showing evidence of splenic and lung lesions possibly consistent with 
a fungal etiology. POS IV had been discontinued on Day 7 due to an AE of pyrexia with the investigator 
decision to start therapy with amphotericin B. 
The other subject had an AE of fungal infection with onset on Day 7 as fever and skin nodules. POS IV 
was discontinued, and the subject was started on amphotericin B. Both of these subjects had IV POS 
Cavg concentrations within the target therapeutic range (subject 1, 1190 ng/ml; and subject 2, 1180 
ng/mL), which were comparable to the mean Cavg for this dose/age group (mean Cavg 1240 ng/mL). 
Both AEs were considered resolved by the end of study follow up.  
Palatability and Acceptability Results 
Palatability and acceptability parameters for the POS PFS formulation were assessed by questionnaire 
on Day 1 and Day 3-5 of POS PFS therapy and at the EOT visit.  
The majority of palatability assessment questionnaires were completed by a nurse or primary caregiver 
for Age Group 1 and by the subject for Age Group 2.  
Taste was assessed as “average,” “good,” or “very good” by the majority of assessors for both 
age groups and all doses at all time points. The majority of subjects in both age groups and all doses 
at all time points did not report any problems taking the PFS dose. 
Problems reported by a minority of subjects included refusing or spitting out the dose, vomiting or 
spitting up, and gagging. The majority of subjects administered the POS PFS formulation found the oral 
formulation to be palatable and acceptable. 
Safety results 
In P097, safety was assessed based on clinical assessment of AEs, physical exams, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory test results, and ECG results of all 115 subjects exposed to study medication. 
Summary of adverse events 
POS was generally well tolerated in pediatric subjects aged 2 to 17 years at all administered doses as 
both an IV solution and PFS formulation. As expected in this critically ill patient population, the 
incidence of AEs was high (98.3%) and SAEs were reported for 27% of subjects. Rates of AEs across 
all AE categories, including drug-related AEs and SAEs, were generally comparable between age 
groups and dose cohorts. Increasing study treatment dosage was not associated with higher AE rates 
or drugs-related AE rates. Overall AE rates, including rates of drug-related AEs and discontinuation of 
study treatment due to AEs, were lower during treatment with the PFS formulation than during 
treatment with the IV formulation. AEs were distributed across a variety of SOCs for both the POS IV 
and POS PFS cohorts.

Common adverse events 
The most common AEs in the study population (occurring in >20% of subjects) included pyrexia, 
mucosal inflammation, vomiting, diarrhea and febrile neutropenia. There was no apparent pattern to 
AEs that would indicate a clear difference between the age groups or dose cohorts. Observed AEs were 
generally consistent with those expected in a pediatric oncology population undergoing treatment for 
malignancy or with the known safety profile of POS.

Drugs-related adverse events 
Drug-related AEs were reported in 17 (14.8%) subjects overall. There were no drug-related AEs that 
were reported in >5% of subjects overall. The most frequent drug-related AEs (occurring in >2% of 
subjects overall) were AST increased and rash. Overall, 4 (3.5%) subjects discontinued study 
treatment due to drug-related AEs. The incidence of drug-related AEs by dose was 11.4%, 25.8% and 
10.2% for the 3.5, 4.5 and 6 mg/kg cohorts, respectively. There was no apparent pattern to drug-
related AEs that would indicate a clear difference among the dose groups. 
An analysis of drug-related AEs by steady-state average plasma concentrations for the POS IV and POS 
PFS formulations was conducted. No correlation between drug-related AEs and POS exposures was 
observed for either the POS IV or POS PFS formulations.

Serious adverse events 
Overall, SAEs were reported in 27.0% of subjects. The overall incidence and distribution of SAEs were 
similar between age groups and dose cohorts. The most common SAE was febrile neutropenia (2.6%). 
Other SAEs occurring in >1% of subjects were veno-occlusive disease, pyrexia and vomiting. One 
subject (0.9%) in Age Group 1 of the 3.5 mg/kg cohort experienced a drug-related SAE of drug 
hypersensitivity, with onset on Day 3 of POS IV treatment. POS IV treatment was discontinued due to 
this drug-related SAE on Day 9 and the drug-related SAE was considered resolved on Day 11. The 
subject’s steady-state average plasma concentration while on POS IV was 449 ng/mL. 
Deaths 
All subjects were to be followed for a total study duration of 90 days. Overall 4 subjects died prior to 
the final survival assessment (Day 90 to 110). Two of these deaths occurred after the end of the AE 
monitoring period (through 14 days after last dose of study treatment) and were due to the subject’s 
underlying malignancy (1 subject in the 3.5 mg/kg/day cohort and 1 subject in the 6 mg/kg/day 
cohort). These 2 subject deaths were not reported as deaths due to AEs. Two subjects died due to AEs 
of respiratory failure and veno-occlusive disease, respectively. Both subjects were in Age Group 2 of 
the 6 mg/kg cohort. Both fatal AEs occurred after the end of study treatment. Neither fatal AE was 
related to study intervention. 
Adverse events leading to intervention discontinuation 
Overall, 15.7% of subjects discontinued due to an AE and 3.5% discontinued due to a drug-related 
AEs. A higher proportion of subjects discontinued due to an AE during IV POS treatment (13.0%) than 
during PFS POS treatment (2.6%). Drug-related AEs that resulted in discontinuation included: ECG QT 
prolonged, ALT increased, AST increased, epistaxis and rash. 
The AE of QT prolonged (Grade 1) was reported in a subject in Age Group 2 of the 6 mg/kg cohort with 
onset on Day 14 and resolution 9 days later. The subject had been previously diagnosed with an AE of 
endocarditis on Day 4. Other concurrent AEs included hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and 
hypomagnesemia. The subject’s QTcF increased from a baseline of 386 to 430 ms. The subject had a 
steady-state average plasma POS concentration of 3060 ng/mL while on IV POS. 
The AEs of ALT increased, and AST increased occurred in a subject in Age Group 2 of the 6 mg/kg 
cohort who had a medical history of abnormal liver function tests and had elevated ALT and AST at 
baseline. The AEs of ALT/AST increased (Grade 3) were reported on Day 2 of IV POS dosing and study 
treatment was discontinued after the Day 2 dose. The AEs of ALT increased, and AST increased were 
reported as resolved by Day 18. Because the subject discontinued study treatment prior to the steady-
state PK sampling visit there is no POS average plasma concentration value for this subject. 
The AE of epistaxis was assessed on Day 2 of IV POS therapy in a subject in Age Group 1 of the 3.5 
mg/kg cohort. Study treatment was discontinued on Day 8 and the AE of epistaxis was considered 
resolved on Day 11. The subject had a steady-state average plasma POS concentration of 449 ng/mL 
while on IV POS. 
The AE of rash occurred in a subject in Age Group 1 of the 6 mg/kg cohort. The AE began on Day 1 of 
study treatment and study treatment was discontinued on Day 12. The AE was resolved by Day 14. 
The subject had a steady-state average plasma POS concentration of 1760 ng/mL while on IV POS. 
Overdose 
One Age Group 1 subject in the 3.5 mg/kg cohort was reported to have an accidental overdose without 
adverse effect. This subject received 3.2 mL of POS IV instead of 3.1 mL for their first dose based on a 
pharmacy error. All subsequent doses were correct. 
EMA/507864/2019  
Page 35/46 
 
 
  
 
 
Hepatic safety 
None of the subjects had liver function laboratory findings that met predetermined criteria for potential 
drug-induced liver injury (DILI) of an elevated AST or ALT value that is ≥3 times the ULN and an 
elevated total bilirubin value that is ≥2 times the ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase 
value that is <2 times the ULN. 
Safety summary: 
In P097, POS was generally well tolerated in pediatric subjects aged 2 to 17 years at all administered 
doses as both an IV solution and PFS formulation. This safety profile in pediatric reflects the underlying 
severity of illness present in the pediatric oncology population studied and was similar to that 
previously reported for POS in adults. There was no apparent pattern to suggest a dose-related, 
exposure-related or age-related difference in the safety profile. 
Overall rates of AEs were high and were consistent with rates and types of AEs expected in a 
hospitalized pediatric population undergoing treatment for malignancy. Deaths due to AEs occurred in 
2 subjects (1.7%). Both fatal AEs occurred after the end of study treatment. Neither fatal AE was 
related to study intervention. Drug-related AEs occurred in 14.8% of subjects, but discontinuation due 
to drug-related AEs occurred in only 4 subjects (3.5%). SAEs occurred in 27% of subjects but only 
subject experienced a drug-related SAE. AEs consistent with possible or probable IFIs were reported in 
2 subjects (1.7%) during the study period. Although numerical differences in AEs were observed, there 
was no apparent pattern to suggest a difference in the safety profiles among the 3 dosing cohorts nor 
among the younger (Age Group 1) and older (Age Group 2) age groups. 
CHMP comments 
Adverse events incidence was high in all groups, which was expected in this critically ill population. 
Most common reported AEs (occurring in >20% of subjects) were pyrexia, mucosal inflammation, 
vomiting, diarrhea and febrile neutropenia. 
SAEs were reported in 27.0% of subjects. The most common SAE was febrile neutropenia (2.6%). 
Other SAEs occurring in >1% of subjects were veno-occlusive disease, pyrexia and vomiting. 4 
experienced a drug-related AEs all resolved. 
The most frequent drug-related AEs were AST increased and rash. 4 subjects discontinued study 
treatment due to drug-related AEs. Drug-related AEs that resulted in discontinuation included: ECG 
QT prolonged, ALT increased, AST increased, epistaxis and rash. All drug-related AEs were resolved. 
4 subjects died prior to the final survival assessment. Two of these deaths occurred after the end of 
the AE monitoring period and were due to the subject’s underlying malignancy. These 2 subject 
deaths were not reported as deaths due to AEs. Two subjects died due to AEs of respiratory failure 
and veno-occlusive disease, respectively. Both fatal AEs occurred after the end of study treatment. 
Neither fatal AE was related to study intervention. 
1 subject was reported to have an accidental overdose without adverse effect.  
Overall, incidence rate of AEs was high in all groups, as expected. No new adverse events were seen 
then already known and described in the SmPC. Appropriate warnings for liver function disturbances 
are already described in the SmPC.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
PK results 
The  clinical  pharmacology  data  of  POS  in  the  paediatric  population  is  supported  by  one  clinical  study 
(Study P097), with the goal to identify a dosing regimen of IV and oral POS in paediatrics that would 
achieve  the  exposure  of  POS  associated  with  efficacy  and  safety  in  adults  when  taking  POS  IV  or 
tablet.  The  PK  target  for  POS  established  through  the  adult  development  program  was  a  geometric 
mean  of  Cavg  of  approximately  1200  ng/mL,  with  approximately  90%  of  subjects  with  steady  state 
Cavg at least of 500 ng/mL. 
Two formulations were used, a known IV formulation and a developed new formulation named PFS, an 
oral  suspension  considered  as  a  more  age-appropriate  and  dose-flexible  oral  formulation  for 
paediatrics. 
Three sequential weight-based cohorts (3.5, 4.5 and 6.0 mg/kg/day) were studied. Subjects received 
10 to 28 days of POS IV with the option to switch to PFS after 10 days. 
Full  PK  sampling  were  performed  to  investigate  POS  and  also  SBECBD  PK  when  administered  by  IV 
route. 
Generally,  based  on  the  validation  reports,  the  used  bioanalytical  methods  developed  for  the 
quantification  of  POS  and  SBECD,  in  human  plasma  comply  with  acceptance  criteria.  Analytical 
validation reports were provided with satisfactory results. 
POS PK have been adequately characterized after both IV and PFS administration.  
Data exclusion and missing samples have been adequately handled. However it should be noted that 
PK parameters calculation suffers of many PK data imputation, not only for the PFS arm as claimed by 
the MAH, and this is expected when using NCA approach. The use of a Population PK modelling remain 
a more reliable approach to estimate PK parameters of interest, this have been performed according to 
the MAH. Results from the PopPK analysis highlight that the Cavg predicted by the PopPK model were 
similar to those estimated using a NCA approach. 
PK  results  of  this  study  clearly  show  that  the  PK  target  (90%  of  subjects  with  steady  state  Cavg  at 
least of 500 ng/mL) is reached with both the 4.5 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg cohort whatever the age group. 
This  implicitly  suggests  support  of  the  use  of  a  weight  based  dosing  for  POS  in  the  paediatric 
population. 
SBEBCD PK have been adequately characterized after IV administration.  
The  MAH  stated  that  SBEBCD  PK  was  generally  similar  in  both  age  groups  within  each  dose  cohort. 
However it could be observed, particularly in the Age Group 1 (2 to < 7 years), that as dose increase 
from  3.5  to  6  mg/kg,  mean  terminal  half-life  increase  from  1.71h  to  2.58h.  However,  based  on  an 
exploratory  assessment  of  the  exposure-safety  relation  with  SBEβCD  PK  as  input,  no  association 
between SBEβCD PK exposure metrics (Cmax and AUC0-12h) and AEs was observed. 
Safety results 
In P097, POS was generally well tolerated in pediatric subjects aged 2 to 17 years at all administered 
doses as both an IV solution and PFS formulation. This safety profile in pediatric reflects the underlying 
severity of illness present in the pediatric oncology population studied and was similar to that 
previously reported for POS in adults. There was no apparent pattern to suggest a dose-related, 
exposure-related or age-related difference in the safety profile.

Summary of MAH’s response 
The  modelling  and  simulation  report  describing  the  population  PK  analysis  of  posaconazole  (POS)  in 
pediatrics is appended to this response. A comparison of PK parameters derived by NCA and population 
PK approaches is provided in section 4.4.3.1 of the report. 
Objectives 
The  modeling  and  simulation  in  support  of  posaconazole  (POS)  summarized  in  this  report  aimed  to 
address  key  development  questions  by  conducting  population  PK  analyses  and  simulations  with  the 
following  objectives:  1)  Re-evaluate  the  prior  population  PK  model  (developed  from  studies  P097 
including  dose  cohorts  3.5  mg/kg  and  4.5  mg/kg)  with  newly  generated  data  in  pediatric  subjects 
administered  POS  6  mg/kg,  2)  Simulate  PK  profiles  of  pediatric  subjects  after  administration  of 
different  dose  levels  of  POS  in  order  to  assess  the  percentage  achieving  exposures  (expressed  as 
Cavg) ≥500 ng/mL in two age groups: 2 to < 7 years old and 7 to 17 years old.

This analysis aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of two POS formulations (IV and powder for 
oral suspension (PFS)) intended for use in a pediatric population and to identify a dosage regimen that 
achieves  target  POS  concentrations  associated  with  efficacy  for  prophylaxis  of  invasive  fungal 
infections  in  immunocompromised  adult  subjects.  The  exposure  target  agreed  to  with  regulatory 
agencies  for  the  pediatric program  is  to  identify  a  dosing  strategy  that  will  result  in  a  mean  Cavg  of 
1200  ng/mL  and  approximately  90%  of  subjects  having  a  Cavg  of  at  least  500  ng/mL  and  less  than 
2500 ng/mL.  To that end,  pharmacokinetic data were  obtained  from  a study  in immunocompromised 
pediatric  subjects  with  neutropenia  (P097).  Three  dose  cohorts  (3.5  mg/kg,  4.5  mg/kg  and  6  mg/kg 
(up  to  a  maximum  total  dose  of  300  mg))  were  studied  in  two  age  groups  (2-<7  years  and  7-17 
years). POS was administered IV q12h on Day 1 and IV q.d. up to at least Day10 followed by oral PFS 
administration q.d. through Day 28.  
In total, 114 subjects and 1236 concentration observations were available for the analysis. 
Data for analysis 
A derived dataset for analysis was generated, and consisted of the following information: actual dosing 
and  PK  sampling  times  relative  to  the  time  of  administration/infusion,  log  transformed  POS  plasma 
concentrations,  actual  POS  dose  (in  mg),  route  of  administration,  and  covariates  encompassing 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as bodyweight (WTKG), body mass index (BMI), body surface area 
(BSA), height, age, race, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), food status, and ethnicity. 
Methods 
The population PK analysis was performed using a non-linear mixed effects modeling approach. Based 
upon an existing model for POS in a pediatric population, a compartmental base model was fit to the 
data including both oral PFS and IV solution formulations. As part of the structural model development, 
allometric  scaling  of  clearance  (CL),  and  central  volume  (Vc)  by  body  weight  was  evaluated.The 
different variability components, including inter-individual variability (IIV) and residual variability, were 
optimized. The base model was then used for investigation of the influence of key  covariates such as 
age,  EGFR,  sex  and  ethnicity  on  POS  exposures.  Model  selection  was  based  on  the  Log-Likelihood 
Criterion, goodness of fit plots and scientific plausibility.  
Significance of the covariates was assessed in a stepwise covariate analysis (SCM) based on statistical 
criteria  (p<0.01  for  forward  inclusion,  p<0.001  for  backward  deletion).  Following  completion  of  the 
SCM, an additional assessment was performed to characterize  the impact of different  food covariates 
(food intake 2 hours predose and/or 1 hour postdose) available in two different categorizations (yes/no 
or no meal/light meal/ medium meal/ heavy meal) on bioavailability (F1). Reliability of the final model 
was  confirmed  with  diagnostic  plots,  prediction  corrected  visual  predictive  check  (pcVPC)  and 
comparison  of  derived  PK  parameters  (Cavg  and  Cmin)  obtained  by  a  non-compartmental  analysis 
(NCA) and those calculated from post hoc estimates. 
In  order  to  assess  the  distribution  of  POS  exposures  and  proportions  of  subjects  with  Cavg  ≥  500 
ng/mL  in  the  two  age  groups  of  pediatric  subjects,  virtual  populations  of  subjects  with  age  2  to  <7 
(n=1000) and age 7 to 17 (n=1000) were created and were simulated to receive regimens of IV POS 
BID on Day 1, followed by IV POS QD up to Day 10,  followed by oral PFS POS up to Day 28 at dose 
levels  of  4.5,  6  or  7.5  mg/kg.  In  these  simulations,  the  maximum  total  dose  was  set  to  300  mg, 
equivalent  to  that  applied  in  P097  and  planned  for  the  clinical  setting.  Weight  and  age  were  jointly 
resampled from a combined pediatric population from studies P097 and P03579.

PopPK model 
The pharmacokinetics of POS in pediatric subjects following administration of POS oral  PFS and/or IV 
formulations  were  adequately  described  by  a  1-compartment  population  PK  model  with  first  order 
absorption and a first order disposition from the central compartment. The model was parameterized in 
terms  of  F1,  absorption  rate  constant  (KA)  and  the  allometrically  scaled  parameters  of  CL  and  Vc. 
Exponents for these allometric relationships were estimated, and were similar to the standard values of 
0.75  for  CL  and  1  for  Vc.  Inter-individual  variability  (IIV)  was  included  on  CL,  Vc,  and  F1  and  was 
assumed  to  be  log  normally  distributed.  The  residual  error  was  estimated  as  an  additive  error  on 
logtransformed  concentrations.  None  of  the  available  covariates  were  identified  as  statistically 
significant. Parameter estimates for the final model are presented in Table 6. The effect of the different 
food  covariates  was  assessed  after  the  full  covariate  analysis  and  was  found  not  to  be  statistically 
significant.

Comparison observed vs Predicted PK parameters 
As a further assessment of the ability of the model to characterize POS exposures,  Figure  5  displays 
the  correlation  between  exposure  parameters  derived  from  the  modelbased  post  hoc  parameter 
estimates and those  obtained from  the NCA  analysis as described  in the  Clinical Study  Report for PN 
097. NCA-derived PK parameters were based on  intensive PK sampling obtained at steady state after 
approximately 10 days of IV or oral PFS administration. 
In general, Cavg and Cmin values after both IV and oral PFS administration approximate the  identity 
line (black dashed line) for each of the included dose levels (3.5,  4.5 and 6 mg/kg), showing that the 
popPK model is able to reproduce adequately the exposure parameters derived from the NCA analysis. 
Distributions of prediction errors for Cavg and Cmin derived from the PopPK analysis in comparison to 
those  from  the  NCA  analysis  are  summarized  in  Table  7.  More  than  80%  of  the  individual  Cavg 
estimates from  the PopPK  are  less than  20%  different from  the NCA-derived values. For Cmin, since 
based  on  a  single  concentration  value  per  individual,  deviations  between  the  estimates  from  the  two 
methods were somewhat larger, with up to 20% of estimates being more than 50% different. Overall, 
even  though  some  discrepancies  were  observed  between  NCA  and  PopPK  model  derived  exposure 
parameters,  these  were  not  indicative  of  any  particular  trend  of  a  bias  with  dose  or  route  of 
administration.

Simulations 
Simulations  indicate  that  for  the  6  mg/kg/day  dose,  model-predicted  Cavg  generally  met  PK  targets. 
Most importantly, model-predicted Cavg was ≥500 ng/mL in more than 90% of subjects in all cohorts. 
The 1200 ng/mL target geometric mean Cavg was achieved for all but the younger cohort receiving the 
PFS formulation. In contrast, for the 4.5 mg/kg/  day dose, model-predicted Cavg did not achieve the 
most  critical  PK  target  (90%  of  subject  with  Cavg  ≥500  ng/mL)  for  subjects  age  2  to  <7  years 
receiving PFS and achieved the 1200 ng/mL target geometric mean Cavg only in subjects 7 to 17 years 
receiving IV. 
Extrapolation  of  POS  PK  to  a  dose  of  7.5  mg/kg/day  for  each  formulation  using  the  population  PK 
model predicts that the higher dose would only modestly decrease the proportion of subjects with Cavg 
<500  ng/mL  in  subjects  receiving  PFS  but  would  substantially  increase  the  proportion  of  subjects 
exceeding a Cavg value of 2500 ng/mL across all cohorts. Given that further incremental increases in 
Cavg  above  ~500  ng/mL  were  not  associated  with  a  meaningful  increase  in  efficacy  in  the  pivotal 
studies  of  the  POS  oral  suspension  for  prophylaxis  coupled  with  the  efficacy  data  from  PN097,  these 
model-based  results suggest that  a  further  increase  in  dose  to 7.5 mg/kg/day  would result in higher 
exposures in all subjects in order to improve efficacy in a small proportion of subjects relative to the 6 
mg/kg/day dose. Exposure was similar in pediatric subjects with comparable weights and age was not 
identified  as  a  significant  covariate  supporting  the  conclusion  that  weight-based  dosing  (up  to  a  300 
mg  total  dose)  is  appropriate  in  pediatrics  and  no  further  adjustments  for  other  factors  is  necessary 
Overall,  no  significant  effect  on  POS  bioavailability  was  identified  when  the  PFS  formulation  was 
administered with a meal. 
CHMP comments 
The MAH provided the requested Pop PK model claimed to be reported separately. 
The  developed  PopPK  model  is  considered  acceptable,  based  on  PK  model  structure,  precision  of 
parameter estimates, search and selection of covariates, goodness-of-fit plots and shrinkage.  
Correlation between PK exposure metrics based on population post-hoc vs NCA, clearly show that for 
Cavg, both approaches  yield  similar results (distribution centered on  the line  of  identity), with more 
than 80% of the individual Cavg estimates from the PopPK model, less than 20% different of the NCA 
derived values. However the same trend was not observed for Cmin.  
Nevertheless since the POS target is based on Cavg and not on Cmin, the issue would not be pursued.

2)  The MAH is asked to perform an exposure-safety analysis with PK data from SBEBCD as input. 
Summary of MAH’s response 
To  address  the  Reviewer  request  for  an  exposure-safety  analysis  with  SBEβCD  pharmacokinetic  (PK) 
data,  illustrations  of  drug-related  AEs  by  steady  state  SBEβCD  AUC(0-12h)  and  Cmax  following 
administration of posaconazole (POS) IV formulation containing SBEβCD in PN097 are shown in Figure 
1 and Figure 2, respectively. For this analysis, data were combined across all three POS dose cohorts 
(3.5,  4.5  and  6  mg/kg)  and  both  age  groups  (2-<7  years  old  and  7-17  years  old).  This  exploratory 
assessment  does  not  show  any  association  between  drug-related  AEs  and  SBEβCD  exposures 
consistent with the lack of any apparent dose-related pattern in the safety profile across the 3 POS IV 
dose cohorts.  
EMA/507864/2019  
Page 42/46 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The amounts of SBEβCD  administered  are  7.78,  10,  and  13.3  mg/kg/day for the  POS  3.5, 4.5  and 6 
mg/kg/day  dose  cohorts,  respectively.  As  per  EMA  document  Cyclodextrins  used  as  excipients 
(EMA/CHMP/333892/2013),  “Amounts  of  ca  250  mg/kg/day  for  (…)  6  months  (SBE-β-CD)  are  found 
safe  in  humans  older  than  2  years.”.  Furthermore,  the  threshold  of  20  mg/kg/day  that  triggers 
mandatory labelling on cyclodextrins in package leaflets in the EU is not reached. For these reasons, no 
safety concerns would be anticipated for the SBEβCD amounts mentioned above. 
There are an insufficient number of specific drug-related AEs to support a more detailed analysis.

CHMP comments 
The MAH provided the requested analysis. 
Based on the exploratory assessment of the exposure-safety relation with SBEβCD PK as input, no 
association between SBEβCD PK exposure metrics (Cmax and AUC0-12h) and AEs is observed.

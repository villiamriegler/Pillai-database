CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
FIRMAGON is a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist indicated: 
- for treatment of adult male patients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.  
- for treatment of high-risk localised and locally advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer in 
combination with radiotherapy. 
- as neo-adjuvant treatment prior to radiotherapy in patients with high-risk localised or locally advanced 
hormone dependent prostate cancer. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Starting dose 
Maintenance dose – monthly 
administration  
240 mg administered as two consecutive 
subcutaneous injections of 120 mg each 
80 mg administered as one subcutaneous 
injection  
The first maintenance dose should be given one month after the starting dose. 
FIRMAGON may be used as neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy in combination with radiotherapy in high-risk 
localised and locally advanced prostate cancer. 
The therapeutic effect of degarelix should be monitored by clinical parameters and prostate specific antigen 
(PSA) serum levels. Clinical studies have shown that testosterone (T) suppression occurs immediately after 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration of the starting dose with 96% of the patients having serum testosterone levels corresponding 
to medical castration (T≤0.5 ng/ml) after three days and 100% after one month. Long term treatment with the 
maintenance dose up to 1 year shows that 97% of the patients have sustained suppressed testosterone levels 
(T≤0.5 ng/ml).  
In case the patient's clinical response appears to be sub-optimal, it should be confirmed that serum 
testosterone levels are remaining sufficiently suppressed. 
Since degarelix does not induce a testosterone surge it is not necessary to add an anti-androgen as surge 
protection at initiation of therapy. 
Special populations 
Elderly, hepatically or renally impaired patients: 
There is no need to adjust the dose for the elderly or in patients with mild or moderate liver or kidney 
function impairment (see section 5.2). Patients with severe liver or kidney impairment have not been studied 
and caution is therefore warranted (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of FIRMAGON in children and adolescents in the treatment of adult male patients 
with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.  
Method of administration 
FIRMAGON must be reconstituted prior to administration. For instructions on reconstitution and 
administration, please see section 6.6. 
FIRMAGON is for subcutaneous use ONLY, not to be administered intravenously. 
Intramuscular administration is not recommended as it has not been studied. 
FIRMAGON is administered as a subcutaneous injection in the abdominal region. The injection site should 
vary periodically. Injections should be given in areas where the patient will not be exposed to pressure e.g. 
not close to waistband or belt and not close to the ribs.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Effect on QT/QTc interval 
Long-term androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval. In the confirmatory study comparing 
FIRMAGON to leuprorelin periodic (monthly) electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed; both 
therapies showed QT/QTc intervals exceeding 450 msec in approximately 20% of the patients, and 500 msec 
in 1% and 2% of the degarelix and leuprorelin patients, respectively (see section 5.1). 
FIRMAGON has not been studied in patients with a history of a corrected QT interval over 450 msec, in 
patients with a history of or risk factors for torsades de pointes and in patients receiving concomitant 
medicinal products that might prolong the QT interval. Therefore in such patients, the benefit/risk ratio of 
FIRMAGON must be thoroughly appraised (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).  
A thorough QT study showed that there was no intrinsic effect of degarelix on QT/QTc interval (see section 
4.8). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with known or suspected hepatic disorder have not been included in long-term clinical trials with 
degarelix. Mild, transient increases in ALT and AST have been seen, these were not accompanied by a rise 
in bilirubin or clinical symptoms. Monitoring of liver function in patients with known or suspected hepatic 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disorder is advised during treatment. The pharmacokinetics of degarelix has been investigated after single 
intravenous administration in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Degarelix has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment and caution is therefore warranted. 
Hypersensitivity 
Degarelix has not been studied in patients with a history of severe untreated asthma, anaphylactic reactions 
or severe urticaria or angioedema. 
Changes in bone density 
Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who 
have been treated with a GnRH agonist. It can be anticipated that long periods of testosterone suppression in 
men will have effects on bone density. Bone density has not been measured during treatment with degarelix. 
Glucose tolerance 
A reduction in glucose tolerance has been observed in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been 
treated with a GnRH agonist. Development or aggravation of diabetes may occur; therefore diabetic patients 
may require more frequent monitoring of blood glucose when receiving androgen deprivation therapy. The 
effect of degarelix on insulin and glucose levels has not been studied. 
Cardiovascular disease 
Cardiovascular disease such as stroke and myocardial infarction has been reported in the medical literature in 
patients with androgen deprivation therapy. Therefore, all cardiovascular risk factors should be taken into 
account. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. 
Since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QTc interval, the concomitant use of degarelix with 
medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval or medicinal products able to induce torsades de 
pointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, 
ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone,  moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc. should be 
carefully evaluated (see section 4.4). 
Degarelix is not a substrate for the human CYP450 system and has not been shown to induce or inhibit 
CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 to any great extent in vitro. 
Therefore, clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions in metabolism related to these 
isoenzymes are unlikely. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
There is no relevant indication for use of FIRMAGON in women. 
Fertility 
FIRMAGON may inhibit male fertility as long as the testosterone is suppressed.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
FIRMAGON has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Fatigue and dizziness 
are common adverse reactions that might influence the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions during degarelix therapy in the confirmatory phase III study 
(N=409) were due to the expected physiological effects of testosterone suppression, including hot flushes 
and weight increase (reported in 25% and 7%, respectively, of patients receiving treatment for one year), or 
injection site adverse reactions. Transient chills, fever or influenza like illness were reported to occur hours 
after dosing (in 3%, 2% and 1% of patients, respectively). 
The injection site adverse reactions reported were mainly pain and erythema, reported in 28% and 17% of 
patients, respectively, less frequently reported were swelling (6%), induration (4%) and nodule (3%). These 
events occurred primarily with the starting dose whereas during maintenance therapy with the 80 mg dose, 
the incidence of these events pr 100 injections was: 3 for pain and <1 for erythema, swelling, nodule and 
induration. The reported events were mostly transient, of mild to moderate intensity and led to very few 
discontinuations (<1%). Serious injection site reactions were very rarely reported such as injection site 
infection, injection site abscess or injection site necrosis that could require surgical treatment/drainage. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequency of undesirable effects listed below is defined using the following convention: 
very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in 
order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Changes in laboratory parameters 
Changes in laboratory values seen during one year of treatment in the confirmatory phase III study (N=409) 
were in the same range for degarelix and a GnRH-agonist (leuprorelin) used as comparator. Markedly 
abnormal (>3*ULN) liver transaminase values (ALT, AST and GGT) were seen in 2-6% of patients with 
normal values prior to treatment, following treatment with both medicinal products. Marked decrease in 
haematological values, hematocrit (≤0.37) and hemoglobin (≤115 g/l) were seen in 40% and 13-15%, 
respectively, of patients with normal values prior to treatment, following treatment with both medicinal 
products. It is unknown to what extent this decrease in haematological values was caused by the underlying 
prostate cancer and to what extent it was a consequence of androgen deprivation therapy. Markedly 
abnormal values of potassium (≥5.8 mmol/l), creatinine (≥177 μmol/l) and BUN (≥10.7 mmol/l) in patients 
with normal values prior to treatment, were seen in 6%, 2% and 15% of degarelix treated patients and 3%, 
2% and 14% of leuprorelin treated patients, respectively.

Changes in ECG measurements 
Changes in ECG measurements seen during one year of treatment in the confirmatory phase III study 
(N=409) were in the same range for degarelix and a GnRH-agonist (leuprorelin) used as comparator. Three 
(<1%) out of 409 patients in the degarelix group and four (2%) out of 201 patients in the leuprorelin 7.5 mg 
group, had a QTcF ≥ 500 msec. From baseline to end of study the median change in QTcF for degarelix was 
12.0 msec and for leuprorelin was 16.7 msec. 
The lack of intrinsic effect of degarelix on cardiac repolarisation (QTcF), heart rate, AV conduction, cardiac 
depolarisation, or T or U wave morphology was confirmed in a thorough QT study in healthy subjects 
(N=80) receiving an i.v. infusion of degarelix over 60 min, reaching a mean Cmax of 222 ng/mL, approx. 3-4-
fold the Cmax obtained during prostate cancer treatment. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no clinical experience with the effects of an acute overdose with degarelix. In the event of an 
overdose the patient should be monitored and appropriate supportive treatment should be given, if considered 
necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, Other hormone antagonists and related agents, ATC code: 
L02BX02  
Mechanism of action 
Degarelix is a selective gonadotrophin releasing-hormone (GnRH) antagonist that competitively and 
reversibly binds to the pituitary GnRH receptors, thereby rapidly reducing the release of the gonadotrophins, 
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thereby reducing the secretion of 
testosterone (T) by the testes. Prostatic carcinoma is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to 
treatment that removes the source of androgen. Unlike GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists do not induce a 
LH surge with subsequent testosterone surge/tumour stimulation and potential symptomatic flare after the 
initiation of treatment. 
A single dose of 240 mg degarelix, followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 80 mg, rapidly causes a 
decrease in the concentrations of LH, FSH and subsequently testosterone. The serum concentration of 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) decreases in a similar manner to testosterone.  
Degarelix is effective in achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression well below medical castration 
level of 0.5 ng/ml. Maintenance monthly dosing of 80 mg resulted in sustained testosterone suppression in 
97% of patients for at least one year. No testosterone microsurges were observed after re-injection during 
degarelix treatment. Median testosterone levels after one year of treatment were 0.087 ng/ml (interquartile 
range 0.06-0.15) N=167. 
Results of the confirmatory Phase III study 
The efficacy and safety of degarelix was evaluated in an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, active 
comparator controlled, parallel-group study. The study investigated the efficacy and safety of two different 
degarelix monthly dosing regimens with a starting dose of 240 mg (40 mg/ml) followed by monthly doses 
subcutaneous administration of 160 mg (40 mg/ml) or 80 mg (20 mg/ml), in comparison to monthly

intramuscular administration of 7.5 mg leuprorelin in patients with prostate cancer requiring androgen 
deprivation therapy. In total 620 patients were randomised to one of the three treatment groups, of which 504 
(81%) patients completed the study. In the degarelix 240/80 mg treatment group 41 (20%) patients 
discontinued the study, as compared to 32 (16%) patients in the leuprorelin group. 
Of the 610 patients treated 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
31% had localised prostate cancer 
29% had locally advanced prostate cancer  
20% had metastatic prostate cancer  
7% had an unknown metastatic status 
13% had previous curative intent surgery or radiation and a rising PSA 
Baseline demographics were similar between the arms. The median age was 74 years (range 47 to 98 years). 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that degarelix is effective with respect to achieving and 
maintaining testosterone suppression to below 0.5 ng/ml, during 12 months of treatment.  
The lowest effective maintenance dose of 80 mg degarelix was chosen. 
Attainment of serum testosterone (T) ≤0.5 ng/ml 
FIRMAGON is effective in achieving fast testosterone suppression, see Table 2.

Avoidance of testosterone surge 
Surge was defined as testosterone exceeding baseline by ≥15% within the first 2 weeks. 
None of the degarelix-treated patients experienced a testosterone surge; there was an average decrease of 
94% in testosterone at day 3. Most of the leuprorelin-treated patients experienced testosterone surge; there 
was an average increase of 65% in testosterone at day 3. This difference was statistically significant 
(p<0.001).

The primary end-point in the study was testosterone suppression rates after one year of treatment with 
degarelix or leuprorelin. The clinical benefit for degarelix compared to leuprorelin plus anti-androgen in the 
initial phase of treatment has not been demonstrated. 
Testosterone Reversibility 
In a study involving patients with rising PSA after localised therapy (mainly radical prostatectomy and 
radiation) were administered FIRMAGON for seven months followed by a seven months monitoring period. 
The median time to testosterone recovery (>0.5 ng/mL, above castrate level) after discontinuation of 
treatment was 112 days (counted from start of monitoring period, i.e 28 days after last injection). The median 
time to testosterone >1.5 ng/mL (above lower limit of normal range) was 168 days.  
Long-term effect 
Successful response in the study was defined as attainment of medical castration at day 28 and maintenance 
through day 364 where no single testosterone concentration was greater than 0.5 ng/ml.

Attainment of prostate specific antigen (PSA) reduction 
Tumour size was not measured directly during the clinical trial programme, but there was an indirect 
beneficial tumour response as shown by a 95% reduction after 12 months in median PSA for degarelix.

The median PSA in the study at baseline was: 
• 
for the degarelix 240/80 mg treatment group 19.8 ng/ml (interquartile range: P25 9.4 ng/ml, P75 
46.4 ng/ml)  
for the leuprorelin 7.5 mg treatment group 17.4 ng/ml (interquartile range: P25 8.4 ng/ml, P75 
56.5 ng/ml) 
• 
Figure 2: Percentage change in PSA from baseline by treatment group until day 56 (median with interquartile 
ranges). 
This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001) for the pre-specified analysis at day 14 and day 28. 
Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels are lowered by 64% two weeks after administration of degarelix, 85% 
after one month, 95% after three months, and remained suppressed (approximately 97%) throughout the one 
year of treatment. 
From day 56 to day 364 there were no significant differences between degarelix and the comparator in the 
percentage change from baseline. 
Effect on prostate volume, disease related mortality and increased disease free survival 
Neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy prior to radiotherapy has been shown to impact prostate volume 
reduction, reduced disease related mortallity and increased disease free survival in patients with high-risk 
localised or locally advanced prostate cancer (RTOG 86-10, TROG 96-01, RTOG 92-02, and Mason M et al. 
Clinical Oncology 2013). 
In a randomised parallel-arm, active-controlled, open-label trial, conducted in 244 men with a UICC prostate 
cancer TNM category T2 (b or c)/T3/T4, N0, M0, Gleason score >7, or prostate specific antigen >10ng/mL 
and a total prostate volume >30, three months therapy with degarelix (240/80 mg dose regimen) resulted in a 
37% reduction in prostate volume as measured by trans-rectal ultrasound scan (TRUS) in patients requiring 
hormonal therapy prior to radiotherapy and in patients who were candidates for medical castration. The 
prostate volume reduction was similar to that attained with goserelin plus anti-androgen protection (Mason 
M et al. Clinical Oncology 2013).  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Combination with radiotherapy 
The effect of degarelix in combination with radiotherapy is based on an indirect comparison to the LHRH 
agonists efficacy data by using the clinical efficacy surrogate endpoints; testosterone suppression and PSA 
reduction demonstrating non-inferiority to LHRH agonists and indirectly establish efficacy. 
In patients with locally advanced prostate cancer several randomised long-term clinical trials provide 
evidence for the benefit of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with radiotherapy (RT) 
compared to RT alone (RTOG 85-31, RTOG 86-10, EORTC 22863). 
Clinical data from a phase III clinical trial (EORTC 22961) in 970 patients with locally advanced prostate 
cancer (mainly T2c-T4 with some T1c to T2b patients with pathological regional nodal disease) have shown 
that radiotherapy followed by long-term therapy (3 years) is preferable to short-term therapy (6 months). 
Overall total mortality at 5 years in the short-term hormonal treatment and long-term hormonal treatment 
groups was 19.0% and 15.2% respectively, with a relative risk of 1.42 (an upper one sided 95.71% CI = 1.79; 
or two sided 95.71% CI = [1.09; 1.85], p = 0.65 for non-inferiority and p = 0.0082 for post-hoc test of 
difference between groups of treatment). The 5-year mortality specifically related to the prostate cancer in 
the short-term hormonal treatment and long-term hormonal treatment groups was 4.78% and 3.2% 
respectively, with a relative risk of 1.71 (95% CI = [1.14 to 2.57], p = 0.002). 
The recommended duration of androgen deprivation therapy in medical guidelines for T3-T4 patients 
receiving radiotherapy is 2-3 years. 
Evidence for the indication of high-risk localized prostate cancer is based on a number of published studies 
of radiotherapy combined with GnRH analogues. Clinical data from five published studies were analyzed 
(EORTC 22863, RTOG 85-31, RTOG 92-02, RTOG 86-10 and D’Amico et al., JAMA 2004), which all 
demonstrate a benefit for the combination of GnRH analogue with radiotherapy. 
Clear difference of the respective study populations for the indications locally advanced prostate cancer and 
high-risk localized prostate cancer was not possible in the published studies. 
Effect on QT/QTc intervals 
In the confirmatory study comparing FIRMAGON to leuprorelin periodic electrocardiograms were 
performed. Both therapies showed QT/QTc intervals exceeding 450 msec in approximately 20% of the 
patients. From baseline to end of study the median change for FIRMAGON was 12.0 msec and for 
leuprorelin it was 16.7 msec. 
Anti-degarelix antibodies 
Anti-degarelix antibody development has been observed in 10% of patients after treatment with 
FIRMAGON for one year and 29% of patients after treatment with FIRMAGON for up to 5.5 years. There is 
no indication that the efficacy or safety of FIRMAGON treatment is affected by antibody formation after up 
to 5.5 years of treatment.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
FIRMAGON in all subsets of the paediatric population (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration of 240 mg degarelix at a concentration of 40 mg/ml to prostate 
cancer patients in the pivotal study CS21, AUC0-28 days was 635 (602-668) day*ng/ml, Cmax was 66.0 (61.0-
71.0) ng/ml and occurred at tmax at 40 (37-42) hours. Mean trough values were approximately 11-12 ng/ml 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after the starting dose and 11-16 ng/ml after maintenance dosing of 80 mg at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. 
Cmax degarelix plasma concentration decreases in a biphasic fashion, with a mean terminal half-life (t½) of 29 
days for the maintenance dose. The long half-life after subcutaneous administration is a consequence of a 
very slow release of degarelix from the depot formed at the injection site(s). The pharmacokinetic behavior 
of the medicinal product is influenced by its concentration in the solution for injection. Thus, Cmax and 
bioavailability tend to decrease with increasing dose concentration while the half-life is increased. Therefore, 
no other dose concentrations than the recommended should be used.  
Distribution 
The distribution volume in healthy elderly men is approximately 1 l/kg. Plasma protein binding is estimated 
to be approximately 90%. 
Biotransformation 
Degarelix is subject to common peptidic degradation during the passage of the hepato-biliary system and is 
mainly excreted as peptide fragments in the faeces. No significant metabolites were detected in plasma 
samples after subcutaneous administration. In vitro studies have shown that degarelix is not a substrate for 
the human CYP450 system. 
Elimination 
In healthy men, approximately 20-30% of a single intravenously administered dose is excreted in the urine, 
suggesting that 70-80% is excreted via the hepato-biliary system. The clearance of degarelix when 
administered as single intravenous doses (0.864-49.4 µg/kg) in healthy elderly men was found to be 35-
50 ml/h/kg. 
Special populations

No pharmacokinetic studies in renally impaired patients have been conducted. Only about 20-30% of a given 
dose of degarelix is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. A population pharmacokinetics analysis of the data 
from the confirmatory Phase III study has demonstrated that the clearance of degarelix in patients with mild 
to moderate renal impairment is reduced by approximately 23%; therefore, dose adjustment in patients with 
mild or moderate renal impairment is not recommended. Data on patients with severe renal impairment is 
scarce and caution is therefore warranted in this patient population.    
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Degarelix has been investigated in a pharmacokinetic study in patients with mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment. No signs of increased exposure in the hepatically impaired subjects were observed compared to 
healthy subjects. Dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction have not been studied and caution is therefore warranted in this 
group.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Animal reproduction studies showed that degarelix caused infertility in male animals. This is due to the 
pharmacological effect; and the effect was reversible. 
In female reproduction toxicity studies degarelix revealed findings expected from the pharmacological 
properties. It caused a dosage dependent prolongation of the time to mating and to pregnancy, a reduced 
number of corpora lutea, and an increase in the number of pre- and post-implantation losses, abortions, early 
embryo/foetal deaths, premature deliveries and in the duration of parturition. 
Nonclinical studies on safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential 
revealed no special hazard for humans. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed no signs of QT prolongation. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No target organ toxicity was observed from acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies in rats 
and monkeys following subcutaneous administration of degarelix. Drug-related local irritation was noted in 
animals when degarelix was administered subcutaneously in high doses.

needle. 
Pack-size of 3 trays containing 3 powder vials, 3 solvent pre-filled syringes, 3 plunger rods, 3 vial adapters 
and 3 needles. 
FIRMAGON 120 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection 
Pack-size of 2 trays containing 2 powder vials, 2 solvent pre-filled syringes, 2 plunger rods, 2 vial adapters 
and 2 needles. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The instructions for reconstitution must be followed carefully. 
Administration of other concentrations is not recommended because the gel depot formation is influenced by 
the concentration. The reconstituted solution should be a clear liquid, free of undissolved matter. 
NOTE: THE VIALS SHOULD NOT BE SHAKEN 
The pack contains one vial of powder and one pre-filled syringe with solvent that must be prepared for 
subcutaneous injection.  
1.  Remove the cover from the vial adapter pack. 
Attach the adapter to the powder vial by pressing 
the adapter down until the spike pushes through 
the rubber stopper and the adapter snaps in place. 
2. Prepare the pre-filled syringe by attaching the plunger rod. 
3. Remove the cap of the pre-filled syringe. Attach 
the syringe to the powder vial by screwing it on 
to the adapter. Transfer all solvent to the 
powder vial. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. With the syringe still attached to the adapter, 
swirl gently until the liquid looks clear and without 
undissolved powder or particles. If the powder 
adheres to the side of the vial above the liquid 
surface, the vial can be tilted slightly. Avoid shaking 
to prevent foam formation. 
  A ring of small air bubbles on the surface of the 
liquid is acceptable. The reconstitution procedure 
usually takes a few minutes, but may take up to 15 
minutes in some cases. 
5. Turn the vial upside down and draw up to the line 
mark on the syringe for injection.  
Always make sure to withdraw the precise 
volume and adjust for any air bubbles. 
FIRMAGON 80 mg powder and solvent for solution for 
injection: withdrawn until the line marking at 4 ml. 
FIRMAGON 120 mg powder and solvent for solution 
for injection: withdrawn until the line marking at 
3 ml. 
6. Detach the syringe from the vial adapter and attach the needle for deep subcutaneous 
injection to the syringe. 
7. Perform a deep subcutaneous injection. To do so: 
grasp the skin of the abdomen, elevate the 
subcutaneous tissue and insert the needle deeply at 
an angle of not less than 45 degrees. 
FIRMAGON 80 mg powder and solvent for solution for 
injection: Inject 4 ml of FIRMAGON 80 mg slowly, 
immediately after reconstitution. 
FIRMAGON 120 mg powder and solvent for solution 
for injection: Inject 3 ml of FIRMAGON 120 mg 
slowly, immediately after reconstitution. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8. No injections should be given in areas where the patient will be exposed to pressure, e.g. 
around the belt or waistband or close to the ribs. 
  Do not inject directly into a vein. Gently pull back the plunger to check if blood is 
aspirated. If blood appears in the syringe, the medicinal product can no longer be used. 
Discontinue the procedure and discard the syringe and the needle (reconstitute a new dose 
for the patient). 
9. FIRMAGON 120 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection 
  Repeat the reconstitution procedure for the second dose. Choose a different injection site 
and inject 3 ml.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What FIRMAGON is and what it is used for 
FIRMAGON contains degarelix. 
Degarelix is a synthetic hormone blocker used in the treatment of prostate cancer and for the treatment of 
high-risk prostate cancer prior to radiotherapy and in combination with radiotherapy in adult male patients. 
Degarelix mimics a natural hormone (gonadotrophin-relasing hormone, GnRH) and directly blocks its 
effects. By doing so, degarelix immediately reduces the level of the male hormone testosterone that 
stimulates the prostate cancer. 
2.  What you need to know before you use FIRMAGON 
Do not use FIRMAGON  
− 
If you are allergic to degarelix or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Please tell your doctor if you have any of the following: 
−  Any cardiovascular conditions or heart rhythm problems (arrythmia), or are being treated with medicines 
for this condition. The risk of heart rhythm problems may be increased when using FIRMAGON. 
−  Diabetes mellitus. Worsening or onset of diabetes may occur. If you have diabetes, you may have to 
measure blood glucose more frequently. 
−  Liver disease. Liver function may need to be monitored. 
−  Kidney disease. Use of FIRMAGON has not been investigated in patients with severe kidney disease. 
−  Osteoporosis or any condition that affects the strenght of your bones. Reduced level of testosterone may 
cause a reduction in bone calcium (thinning of bones).  
−  Severe hypersensitivity. Use of FIRMAGON has not been investigated in patients with severe 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents. 
Other medicines and FIRMAGON 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIRMAGON might interfere with some medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, 
procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol) or other medicines which can have an effect on heart rhythm (e.g. 
methadone (used for pain relief and as part of drug addiction detoxification), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), 
antipsychotics). 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Driving and using machines 
Tiredness and dizziness are common side effects that may impair your ability to drive and use machines. 
These side effects may be due to the treatment or effects resulting from the underlying disease. 
3. 
How to use FIRMAGON 
This medicine is usually injected by a nurse or a doctor. 
The recommended starting dose is two consecutive injections of 120 mg. After that, you will receive a 
monthly 80 mg injection. The injected liquid forms a gel from which degarelix is released over a period of 
one month. 
FIRMAGON must be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) ONLY. FIRMAGON must NOT be given 
into a blood vessel (intravenously). Precautions must be taken to avoid accidental injection into a vein. The 
site of injection is likely to vary within the abdominal region. 
If you forget to use FIRMAGON 
If you believe your monthly dose of FIRMAGON has been forgotten, please talk to your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Instructions for proper use 
NOTE:  
•  DO NOT SHAKE THE VIALS 
The pack contains one vial of powder and one pre-filled syringe with solvent that must be prepared for 
subcutaneous injection.  
1.  Remove the cover from the vial adapter pack. 
Attach the adapter to the powder vial by pressing 
the adapter down until the spike pushes through 
the rubber stopper and the adapter snaps in place. 
2. Prepare the pre-filled syringe by attaching the plunger rod. 
3. Remove the cap of the pre-filled syringe. Attach 
the syringe to the powder vial by screwing it on 
to the adapter. Transfer all solvent to the 
powder vial. 
4. With the syringe still attached to the adapter, swirl 
gently until the liquid looks clear and without 
undissolved powder or particles. If the powder 
adheres to the side of the vial above the liquid 
surface, the vial can be tilted slightly. Avoid shaking 
to prevent foam formation. 
  A ring of small air bubbles on the surface of the 
liquid is acceptable. The reconstitution procedure 
usually takes a few minutes, but  may take up to 15 
minutes in some cases. 
5. Turn the vial upside down and draw up to the line 
mark on the syringe for injection.  
Always make sure to withdraw the precise 
volume and adjust for any air bubbles.  
6. Detach the syringe from the vial adapter and attach the needle for deep subcutaneous 
injection to the syringe. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7. Perform a deep subcutaneous injection. To do so: 
grasp the skin of the abdomen, elevate the 
subcutaneous tissue and insert the needle deeply at 
an angle of not less than 45 degrees.  
Inject 4 ml of FIRMAGON 80 mg slowly, 
immediately after reconstitution.* 
8. No injections should be given in areas where the patient will be exposed to pressure, e.g. 
around the belt or waistband or close to the ribs. 
  Do not inject directly into a vein. Gently pull back the plunger to check if blood is 
aspirated. If blood appears in the syringe, the medicinal product can no longer be used. 
Discontinue the procedure and discard the syringe and the needle (reconstitute a new dose 
for the patient). 
*  Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 2 hours at 25ºC. From a 
microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution precludes the risk of microbial 
contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times 
and conditions are the responsibility of the user.

FIRMAGON contains degarelix. 
Degarelix is a synthetic hormone blocker used in the treatment of prostate cancer and for the treatment of 
high-risk prostate cancer prior to radiotherapy and in combination with radiotherapy in adult male patients. 
Degarelix mimics a natural hormone (gonadotrophin-relasing hormone, GnRH) and directly blocks its 
effects. By doing so, degarelix immediately reduces the level of the male hormone testosterone that 
stimulates the prostate cancer.

NOTE:  
•  DO NOT SHAKE THE VIALS 
The pack contains two vials of powder and two pre-filled syringes with solvent that must be prepared for 
subcutaneous injection. Hence, the procedure described below need to be repeated a second time. 
1.  Remove the cover from the vial adapter pack. 
Attach the adapters to the powder vial by 
pressing the adapter down until the spike 
pushes through the rubber stopper and the 
adapter snaps in place. 
2. Prepare the pre-filled syringe by attaching the plunger rod. 
3. Remove the cap of the pre-filled syringe. Attach 
the syringe to the powder vial by screwing it on 
to the adapter. Transfer all solvent to the 
powder vial. 
4. With the syringe still attached to the adapter, 
swirl gently until the liquid looks clear and without 
undissolved powder or particles. If the powder 
adheres to the side of the vial above the liquid 
surface, the vial can be tilted slightly. Avoid 
shaking to prevent foam formation. 
A ring of small air bubbles on the surface of the 
liquid is acceptable. The reconstitution procedure 
usually takes a few minutes, but may take up to 15 
minutes in some cases. 
5. Turn the vial upside down and draw up to the line 
mark of the syringe for injection. 
Always make sure to withdraw the precise 
volume and adjust for any air bubbles. 
6. Detach the syringe from the vial adapter and attach the needle for deep subcutaneous 
injection to the syringe. 
7. Perform a deep subcutaneous injection. To do so: 
grasp the skin of the abdomen, elevate the 
subcutaneous tissue and insert the needle deeply at 
an angle of not less than 45 degrees.  
Inject 3 ml of FIRMAGON 120 mg slowly, 
immediately after reconstitution.* 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8. No injections should be given in areas where the patient will be exposed to pressure, e.g. 
around the belt or waistband or close to the ribs. 
  Do not inject directly into a vein. Gently pull back the plunger to check if blood is 
aspirated. If blood appears in the syringe, the medicinal product can no longer be used. 
Discontinue the procedure and discard the syringe and the needle (reconstitute a new dose 
for the patient). 
9. Repeat the reconstitution procedure for the second dose. Choose a different injection site 
and inject 3 ml.  
*  Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 2 hours at 25ºC. From a 
microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution precludes the risk of microbial 
contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times 
and conditions are the responsibility of the user.

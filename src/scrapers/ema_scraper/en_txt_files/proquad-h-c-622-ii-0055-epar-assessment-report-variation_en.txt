2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
ProQuad is a live attenuated vaccine, for the prevention of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. The 
vaccine is indicated for immunisation of individuals from 12 months of age.  
The refrigerator stable formulation of ProQuad was first authorised in the USA on 04 August 2006 and 
in Europe on 12 September 2006. 
The Marketing Authorisation was renewed in 2011.  
This variation was submitted following the CHMP assessment of Follow Up Measure P46-026 (CSR of 
the study MRV02C investigating a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad (MMRV with rHA) in different age groups 
supports the extension of the age indication to children from 9 months of age onwards under special 
circumstances, i.e. outbreak control), which has been submitted in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. 
2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Currently, ProQuad is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella and 
varicella in individuals from 12 months of age. 
In some European countries, the current official recommendations for measles, mumps and rubella 
vaccination are below 12 months of age. In France for instance, it is recommended to administer the 
measles, mumps and rubella vaccines from 9 months of age for children who attend day care centres. 
In Germany, the standing vaccination committee (STIKO) recommends measles, mumps, rubella and 
varicella vaccination from 11 months of age. Moreover, WHO recommends vaccinating children from 9 
months of age against measles. Consequently, the MAH performed study MRV02C with ProQuad to 
evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 2-dose regimen when the first dose is administered from 
9 months of age. Study MRV02C is an open-label, randomised, comparative, multi-centre study 
designed to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad manufactured with recombinant human 
albumin (rHA) administered at a 3 month interval to different age groups of healthy children at the 
time of the first dose is non-inferior in terms of antibody response rates. The study was conducted in 3 
countries (Finland, Germany, France) between November 2007 and December 2008. 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study Design 
In this study, a total of 1,620 subjects were randomised in one of 3 groups (1:1:1; 540 subjects per 
group), to receive 2 doses of ProQuad manufactured with rHA at a 3-month interval. The same interval 
of time was to be respected between Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad in each group in order to solely 
evaluate the impact of the vaccination age on a unique vaccination pattern. Group 1 received the first 
dose of the vaccine at 9 months, Group 2 at 11 months, and Group 3 at 12 months of age. 
The schedule of vaccinations and blood sample collections is shown in Table 1. Blood samples were 
obtained from subjects just prior to ProQuad dose 1 vaccination (blood sample 1), 42 days (±14) after

Vaccine 
In the manufacturing of the doses of ProQuad used in this study MRV02C, human serum albumin 
(HSA) was replaced by recombinant human albumin (rHA). 
The clinical ProQuad batch manufactured with rHA was considered representative for the licensed 
refrigerator-stable vaccine formulation, which is currently manufactured with HSA. 
Study objectives 
The objectives of study MRV02C were as follows:  
−  The first primary objective was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at 
a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age at the time of Dose 1 is as 
immunogenic as in healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1, in terms of 
antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 2. 
−  The second primary objective, which was to be evaluated only if the first primary objective was 
reached, was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at a 3-month interval 
to healthy children of 9 months of age at the time of Dose 1 is as immunogenic as in healthy 
children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1, in terms of antibody response rates to 
measles, mumps, rubella and to varicella at Day 42 following Dose 2.  
−  The third primary objective was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at 
a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age and 9 months of age at the time of 
Dose 1 is well tolerated compared to healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1.  
−  The secondary immunogenicity objectives were to describe the antibody titres to measles, mumps, 
rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad administered to healthy 
children from 9 months of age.  
−  The secondary safety objectives were to evaluate the safety profile of Dose 1 and Dose 2 of 
ProQuad administered to healthy children from 9 months of age. 
The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the antibody response rates, which were defined as: 
•  Measles antibody titre >=255 mIU/ml in subjects with baseline titre <255 mIU/ml. 
Assessment report  
EMA/164243/2013  
Page 4/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Mumps antibody titre >=10 ELISA Ab units/ml in subjects with baseline titre <10 ELISA Ab 
units/ml. 
•  Rubella antibody titre >=10 IU/ml in subjects with baseline titre <10 IU/ml. 
•  Varicella antibody titre >=5 gpELISA units/ml in subjects with baseline titre <1.25 gpELISA 
units/mL 
Serology Assays 
Antibodies to measles, mumps and rubella were determined by validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and antibodies to varicella were determined by glycoprotein enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA).  
The serostatus cut-off of the measles ELISA was 255 mIU/ml. The basis for the cut-off was a review of 
the literature in which the calculated result for the seroprotective antibody level expressed in mIU/ml 
(when compared to the World Health Organization reference standard) was reported as 255 mIU/ml. 
The serostatus cut-off used for the mumps ELISA was determined as the lowest antibody concentration 
that was distinguishable from a panel of 72 negative samples. 
For rubella the serostatus cut-off for the assay was based on the WHO standard.  
The cut-off used in the varicella gpELISA assay was internally defined as 1.25 gpELISA units/ml. 
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of 
the study vaccine and with any post vaccination immunogenicity evaluation. 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) was defined as all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol 
violations which may interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation. 
Two subsets of the Per Protocol Set were defined for the immunogenicity evaluation at the 
corresponding time point, i.e.: 
−  PPS1 consisted of all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol violation(s) which may 
interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation post-Dose 1. 
−  PPS2 consisted of all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol violation(s) which may 
interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation post-Dose 2. 
Analysis of the immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity analysis of the primary criteria was performed on the PPS in initially seronegative 
subjects (main analysis) and on the FAS (supportive analysis). 
For the Per Protocol analysis, only initially seronegative subjects were included in the analyses of the 
corresponding valence: 
− 
− 
− 
For measles, subjects with baseline (BS1) measles antibody titres <255 mIU/mL (i.e. initially 
seronegative to measles), 
For mumps, subjects with baseline (BS1) mumps antibody titres <10.0 ELISA Ab units/mL (i.e. 
initially seronegative to mumps), 
For rubella, subjects with baseline (BS1) rubella antibody titres <10.0 IU/mL (i.e. initially 
seronegative to rubella), 
Assessment report  
EMA/164243/2013  
Page 5/22 
 
 
 
 
 
− 
For varicella, subjects with baseline (BS1) varicella antibody titres <1.25 gpELISA units/mL (i.e. 
initially seronegative to varicella). 
The immunogenicity analysis of the secondary criteria was performed on both PPS in initially 
seronegative subjects and FAS. Also, descriptive statistics were provided on initially seropositive 
subjects at inclusion, if seropositive subjects represent at least 5% of the FAS.  
All subjects with serology results following Dose 2 of ProQuad were included in the FAS whatever 
antibody titres at baseline (BS1). 
In relation with the first primary hypothesis, the estimates of the between groups differences in 
response rates (Group 2 - Group 3) were calculated together with their two-sided 95% CI. If the lower 
bounds of the CI were greater than –5% for measles, mumps and rubella response rates and greater 
than -10% for varicella response rate, it was concluded that the Group 2 response rates are non-
inferior to the Group 3 response rates. 
If the first primary objective was reached, the second primary hypothesis was tested. The estimates of 
the between groups differences in response rates (Group 1 - Group 3) were calculated together with 
their two-sided 95% CI. If the lower bounds of the CI were greater than –5% for measles, mumps and 
rubella response rates and greater than -10% for varicella response rate, it was concluded that the 
Group 1 response rates are non-inferior to the Group 3 response rates. 
2.2.2.  Results 
Subject Disposition 
A total of 1,626 subjects were enrolled between 29 November 2007 and 14 April 2008. Six subjects 
were not randomised either due to protocol deviation or due to other reasons. 
Randomised subjects were enrolled in three countries: 1,290 subjects (79.6%) into 15 centres in 
Finland, 140 subjects (8.6%) into 14 centres in France, and 190 subjects (11.7%) into 19 centres in 
Germany. 
A total of 161 subjects (9.9%) were withdrawn from the study. The majority of subjects (137; 8.5%) 
were withdrawn before first vaccination, 18 subjects (1.1%) between first and second vaccination and 
six subjects (0.4%) after receiving the second vaccine dose. Given the differences in time between 
randomisation and first vaccination in the 3 groups, the number of subjects withdrew from the study 
before Dose 1 was higher in Group 2 (first dose at 11 months) and Group 3 (first dose at 12 months), 
10.4% and 12.8% of subjects respectively, than in Group 1 (first dose at 9 months), 2.2% of subjects. 
The main reason for withdrawal was for personal reason but 3 subjects were withdrawn for adverse 
event: one subject from Group 3 before Dose 1 (viral infection), and two subjects from Group 1 after 
Dose 1 due to serious adverse events assessed by the investigator as non-related to study vaccine 
(one subject for convulsion 2 months after vaccination and one subject for gastroenteritis rotavirus). 
The Full Analysis Set consisted of 1,473 subjects (90.9%): 527 subjects in Group 1, 480 subjects in 
Group 2 and 466 subjects in Group 3. 
The PPS consisted of 1,446 subjects (89.3%) and the PPS1 consisted of 1,426 subjects (88.0%) 
including 519 subjects in Group 1, 460 subjects in Group 2 and 447 subjects in Group 3.

Demographic characteristics 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were comparable between groups except for gender: 
Groups 1 and 2 were constituted of 48% of boys and 52% of girls whereas in Group 3, the gender 
distribution was 52% of boys and 48% of girls. Overall, mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) age at 
inclusion was 9.48 (+/-0.30) months, mean weight was 9.22 (+/-1.14) kg, and mean height was 
72.96 (+/-2.64) cm. At first vaccination, mean (+/- SD) age was 9.51 months (+/-0.30) in Group 1, 
11.26 months (+/- 0.23) in Group 2, and 12.32 months (+/-0.24) in Group 3. 
Regarding the serostatus at baseline, the percentage of subjects considered seropositive for measles, 
mumps and rubella at the time of first vaccination was comparable in the 3 groups (Table 2). For 
varicella the percentage of seropositive subjects decreased with increasing age indicating the 
persistence of maternal antibodies.

Antibody response in initially seropositive subjects 
Response rates and geometric means of measles, mumps, and rubella antibody titres at 6 weeks post-
Dose 1 and post-Dose 2 on antigen specific FAS in initially seropositive subjects were presented in the 
CSR. As regards measles 11 subjects in group 1 were found to be seropositive prior vaccination 
(≥255mUI/ml). Following vaccination a heterogeneous immune response against measles was 
observed within and across the different groups (see below Table 9).

2.2.3.  Discussion 
Concerning the study design, the CHMP agreed that the non-inferiority margins were appropriately 
defined for this study. The immune responses against mumps, rubella and varicella were comparable 
between the groups, and for the second primary objective, non-inferiority was reached between Group 
1 (1st dose at 9 months) and Group 3 (1st dose at 12 monts of age). However, for measles, a 
significant difference in the response rates and GMTs in baseline seronegative children is observed 
depending on the age of administration of the vaccine dose.  Moreover the increase in antibody titres 
post dose 2 was highest in the youngest age category compared to Group 2 and 3.  
In group 1, an increase from 942 mIU/ml after the first dose to 1817 mIU/ml after the second dose 
was observed, which is still lower than the GMT reported after the first dose in older infants. This low 
response might be due to interfering low circulating maternal antibodies or to the immaturity of the 
immune system.  
In summary the post dose 1 and 2 responses are significantly lower in children 9 months of age than in 
infants 11 or 12 months of age. These results corroborate the necessity of further vaccine doses when 
children are vaccinated in their first year of life against measles. Section 4.2 of the SmPC was 
therefore revised to provide clear advice on the administration of further doses. 
In view of initially seropositive subjects, all subjects in group 2 and 3 who were seropositive for 
measles (titre >255 mUI/ml) prior to vaccination had also a measles antibody titre >255 mUI/ml post 
dose 2. Only 81.8% of infants 9 months of age however were determined to have seroprotective 
Assessment report

antibody titers post dose 2. Although the number of subjects in this subgroup analysis is very low 
these results suggest interference of maternal antibodies on the immune response to measles 
vaccination.  
The CHMP considered that the data clearly demonstrate lower response rates to the measles 
component after vaccination of infants 9 months of age. This observation was considered to be likely 
due to circulating maternal antibodies or to the immaturity of the immune system of the children. 
These results confirm that a further dose of vaccine should be given later on as catch-up to ensure 
high seroprotection rates against measles for this population.  
2.3.  Clinical Safety aspects  
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The Safety Set was defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of the study vaccine and 
who had safety follow-up data. Subjects were analysed according to their real age at Dose 1. Subjects 
with an age outside group definitions were reallocated to the group with a closer age definition.  
The schedule for the evaluation of safety parameters is given below in Table 10.

Patient exposure 
The Safety Set consisted of 1,483 subjects (91.5%). One subject randomised in Group 2 (subject 
12016) was over 12 months of age at Dose 1; this subject was analysed in Group 3 for safety analyses 
(according to real age at Dose 1). The extent of exposure is summarised in Table 11

The median follow-up duration was 142 days (range 1; 189) in Group 1, 195 days (range 1; 255) in 
Group 2 and 225 days (range 1; 274) in Group 3. 
Adverse events 
Post dose 1: 
In total, 81.3% of subjects in Group 1, 81.9% in Group 2 and 81.1% in Group 3 reported at least one 
injection-site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event within 28 days following Dose 1. Most of 
these subjects experienced at least one adverse event related to the study vaccine (injection-site 
adverse reaction or vaccine-related systemic adverse event): 58.7% of subjects in Group 1, 60.8% in 
Group 2 and 63.9% in Group 3.  
Regarding fever, 8.8%, 10.3% and 14.8% of subjects reported rectal temperature ≥39.4°C in Groups 
1, 2 and 3 following the first dose of ProQuad, i.e. statistically more in Group 3 (first injection at 12 
months) compared to Group 1 (first injection at 9 months) and Group 2 (first injection at 11 months). 
Post dose 2: 
In total, 72.5% of subjects in Group 1, 75.7% in Group 2 and 72.7% in Group 3 reported at least one 
injection-site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event within 28 days following Dose 2. Most of 
these subjects experienced at least one adverse event related to the study vaccine (injection-site 
adverse reaction or vaccine-related systemic adverse event): 55.0% of subjects in Group 1, 57.8% in 
Group 2 and 54.8% in Group 3.  
As regards the occurrence of fever comparable number of subjects reported rectal temperature 
≥39.4°C in the three groups following the second dose. 
In summary the incidence and intensity of injection-site adverse reactions from Day 0 to Day 28 post-
dose 1 and post dose 2 was comparable between groups. 
Injection site adverse reactions 
The percentage of subjects reporting injection-site adverse reactions from Day 0 to Day 28 post dose 
1 and 2 was comparable between groups (Table 12). Intensity of injection-site adverse reactions from 
Day 0 to Day 28 post-dose 1 and 2 was comparable between groups, being mainly of mild intensity or 
with a diameter <2.5 cm in each group.

Fever 
After the first dose of ProQuad, the incidence of subjects with a rectal (or equivalent) temperature 
≥39.4°C from Day 0 to Day 28 was significantly higher in Group 3 (14.8%) compared to Group 1 
(8.8%) and Group 2 (10.3%). Differences between Groups 1 and 3 was -6.06 % [-10.17; -2.04] and 
between Groups 2 and 3 was -4.57 % [-8.83; -0.33]. The rate of subjects with maximal rectal (or 
equivalent) temperature ≥38.0°C or ≥39.4°C was the highest on the time period Day 5 to Day 12 for 
all study groups.

After the second dose of ProQuad, the incidence of subjects with a rectal (or equivalent) temperature ≥
39.4°C from Day 0 to Day 28 was not significantly different between the three age groups. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Before the first administration of ProQuad, no serious adverse event was reported in Group 1, 
1 serious adverse event was reported by 1 subject (0.2%) in Group 2 (gastroenteritis rotavirus), and 
10 serious adverse events were reported by 7 subjects (1.5%) in Group 3 (bronchitis, gastroenteritis, 
laryngitis and concussion were reported by 1 subject each and gastroenteritis rotavirus, otitis media 
and tonsillitis were reported by 2 subjects each). 
Serious adverse events occurring between the Dose 1 and 2 of ProQuad were more frequently reported 
by subjects from Group 1 (3.4%) than those from Group 2 and Group 3 (1.7% in each group) (Table 
16). Serious adverse events included cardiac disorders, infections and infestations (mainly 
gastroenteritis rotavirus, gastroenteritis and bronchitis), injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications, nervous system disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders.

Of note, the febrile convulsion reported by 1 subject in Group 1 occurred 23 days after the first dose of 
ProQuad and was associated with non-serious otitis media; in addition, the convulsion reported by 
another subject in Group 1 occurred 62 days after the first injection of ProQuad, in a context of 
clinically diagnosed varicella but without fever at the time of the convulsion, the subject however had 
febrile convulsion in her medical history, the event was assessed as a non-serious event by the 
investigator, but it was upgraded by the company as a serious adverse event. 
No serious adverse event occurring between Dose 1 and 2 or reported after the second dose were 
assessed by neither the investigator nor the sponsor to be related to the study vaccine. 
No death was reported during the course of the study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion 
The CHMP noted that the percentage of vaccine related systemic adverse reactions including fever 
reactions is comparable between all three age groups following the first and second vaccination with 
ProQuad. Vaccination of infants from 9-11 months of age does not result in an increase in adverse 
reactions compared with children aged 12 months at the time of first vaccination.  
Serious adverse events occurring between the Dose 1 and 2 of ProQuad were more frequently reported 
by subjects from Group 1 (3.4%) than those from Group 2 and Group 3 (1.7% in each group). 
However, no serious adverse event occurring between Dose 1 and 2 or reported after the second dose 
were assessed by neither the investigator nor the sponsor to be related to the study vaccine. In 
summary, the safety profile is comparable across the different age groups following the first and 
second vaccination with ProQuad, indicating that in principle no safety concern is anticipated by 
vaccinating children from 9 months of age onwards.The CHMP highlighted that the current safety 
profile, especially the higher risk of febrile convulsions following the first dose of ProQuad compared to 
MMR and varicella vaccines, suggests to use ProQuad in subject aged 9 months only under special 
circumstances. 
Overall, the safety data observed in this clinical trial for the two dose regimen are adequate to support 
the conclusion that ProQuad was as well tolerated in the 9 months old vaccinees as in the 11 and 12 
months old vaccinees. The younger age group of children with 9 months  at the time of Dose 1 
tolerated the two vaccinations of ProQuad with a comparable safety profile of the children aged 11 and 
12 months at the time of Dose 1. 
2.4.  Risk management plan 
No revision of the current version 4.0 of the Risk management Plan for ProQuad is required. The 
complete safety data set of study MRV02C is already considered in the current RMP. In addition no new 
safety concern was identified in children 9 to 12 months of age compared to children from 12 months 
of age onwards. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that no new pharmacovigilance 
activities in addition to those already being performed were needed to monitor the safety of the 
product. 
No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.

2.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
During  the  procedure,  the  CHMP  requested  the  following  additional  amendments  to  the  Product 
Information: 
Section 4.1 of the SmPC: 
The initial proposal from the MAH to include day-care as one of the special circumstances under which 
ProQuad  can  be  administered  from  9  months  of  age  onwards  was  not  considered  acceptable,  as  this 
term  is  likely  to  be  interpreted  differently  across  Europe.  In  addition,  the  risk  of  measles  infection  in 
day-care is not well supported by epidemiological data, e.g. in case of no outbreak.  
The complete indication approved is as follows: 
ProQuad  is  indicated  for  simultaneous  vaccination  against  measles,  mumps,  rubella  and  varicella  in 
individuals from 12 months of age. 
ProQuad can be administered to individuals from 9 months of age under special circumstances (e.g., to 
conform  with  national  vaccination  schedules,  outbreak  situations,  or  travel  to  a  region  with  high 
prevalence of measles; see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1). 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
This  section  was  revised  to  highlight  that  the  use  of  ProQuad  should  be  based  on  official 
recommendations,  to  better  clarify  the  dosage  recommendations  for  individuals  12  months  of  age  or 
older and individuals between 9 and 12 months of age, and to highlight that the safety and efficacy of 
ProQuad in children under 9 months of age has not been established. 
Package Leaflet: 
As  the  use  of  the  term  “you  or  your  child”  could  be  misleading  it  is  proposed  to  replace  it  with  “the 
person to be vaccinated”: 
Information provided in the package leaflet was aligned to the revised SmPC 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current  QRD  template,  SmPC  guideline 
and other relevant guidelines, which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The immunogenicity data from study MRV02C investigating a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad (MMRV with 
rHA) in different age groups support the extension of the age indication to children from 9 months of 
age onwards only under special circumstances as outlined above. While the immune responses against 
mumps, rubella and varicella were comparable between the groups, the data clearly indicate that 
vaccination of infants at 9 months of age results in lower antibody responses as regards measles. The 
lower antibody responses are most likely due to interfering pre-existing maternal antibodies or to the 
immaturity of the immune response of these children.  
Assessment report  
EMA/164243/2013  
Page 20/22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore additional vaccine doses are warranted later on in life and in order to provide adequate 
protection a second dose has to be administered given a minimum of 3 months apart. 
No information on the effect of an additional dose of a measles containing vaccine to the primary 
immunisation course of ProQuad is currently available and in any case the current public health effort 
to eliminate measles and congenital rubella shortly would require the use of the most efficient schedule 
providing protection with the lowest number of administrations. 
As regards to safety the incidence and intensity of adverse reactions was comparable in infants 9 
months of age with infants 12 months of age. 
The benefit risk balance is favourable for subjects aged 9 to 12 months receiving ProQuad only under 
special circumstances, when the risk of acquiring measles is particularly high. 
The MAH provided with the submission a revised product information to include immunogenicity and 
safety results of study MRV02C. During the procedure, further amendments were made for sections 
4.1 and 4.2 in line with the CHMP recommendations. 
Taking into account the available efficacy and safety data and the resulting update of the Product 
Information, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance for ProQuad remains positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension of indication to include use from 9 months of age onwards under special circumstances. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet.

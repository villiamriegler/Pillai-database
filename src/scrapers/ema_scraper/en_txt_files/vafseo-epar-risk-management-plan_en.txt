VAFSEO 
Centralised 
Chemical class: n-acyl-alpha amino acid 
Summary of mode of action: Vadadustat inhibits the 
2 isoforms of the prolyl-hydroxylase domain (PHD) 
enzymes leading to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 
stabilisation and increased cellular levels of HIF that 
in turn, stimulates endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) 
expression and improves the oxygen-carrying 
capacity of the blood by stimulating haemoglobin 
(Hb) and red blood cell (RBC) production. 
Important information about its composition: 
Vadadustat is a novel synthetic small molecule 
having the following composition:  
(2-[[5-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxypyridine-2-
carbonyl] amino] acetic acid)

Incidence and Prevalence: 
Global Prevalence of CKD 
CKD, defined as the presence of kidney damage or a decreased level of kidney function 
for 3 or more months, is a major public health problem worldwide.1 It is estimated to 
affect around 8% to 16% of the general population globally.2 The Kidney Disease 
Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines have classified CKD into five stages as 
per disease severity (as indicated in Table 2.1-1).

Incidence of CKD Patients receiving Kidney Replacement Therapy (KRT)  
KRT is either haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation. The 
incidence of kidney failure patients having KRT as per European Renal Association-
European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) Registry’s 2018 Annual 
Report was 129 per million population (p.m.p). Of this number, 62% were identified as 
male, 51% were ≥65 years of age, and 20% had diabetes mellitus as the cause of kidney 
failure. The prevalence of kidney failure (patients eligible for KRT) was 897 p.m.p, 
ranging from 229 p.m.p in the Ukraine to 2011 p.m.p in Portugal. The treatment modality 
at the onset of KRT was HD (84%), peritoneal dialysis (11%) and pre-emptive kidney 
transplantation (5%).4 
Global or European level data for the incidence rate (IR) of CKD was not available. 
Prevalence of Anaemia in CKD 
Anaemia is an important complication of CKD which contributes significantly to the 
heavy symptom burden of CKD especially poorer quality of life (QoL) and an increased 
risk of adverse clinical outcomes. It has a major impact on the lives of people with CKD 
but it is potentially reversible with appropriate treatment.1 Hb thresholds used to define 
anaemia are presented below in Table 2.1-3 .

Anaemia is relatively common in CKD patients especially in those with increasing 
disease severity, with rates of up to 90% in Stage 5 CKD patients.2 
Globally, the prevalence of anaemia is 24.8% in the general population. CKD emerges as 
an important contributor to overall anaemia burden in high-income countries (7.4%), 
Tropical Latin America (17.4%), Central Europe (9.8%), and Eastern Europe (10.8%).5 
Page 13 of 87 
Risk Factors associated with the prevalence of anaemia in CKD 
The risk factors mostly associated with the prevalence of anaemia in CKD are: 
•  CKD Stage: Prevalence of anaemia increases with CKD severity and there is a 
negative association between the prevalence of anaemia and GFR, indicating that the 
percentage of patients with anaemia increases as kidney function decreases. For 
example, the percentage of patients with Hb ≤12 g/dL increased from 26.7% to 75.5% 
as GFR decreased from ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.6 
•  Patients receiving HD have decreased RBC survival due to the HD procedure.60  
•  Etiology of CKD: The prevalence of anaemia (Hb ≤ 12 g/dL) was highest among 
patients with CKD caused by diabetes (53.8%), followed by vascular disease 
(43.6%), hypertension (42.2%), multiple myeloma/ dysproteinemia (42.1%), and 
glomerulonephritis (38.9%).6 
• 
Iron Stores in CKD: Transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin levels were significant 
predictors of anaemia. Substantial number of anaemic patients with CKD were found 
to have insufficient iron stores to support erythropoiesis. Patients with TSAT of 
<20% were associated with 2 times higher risk of developing anaemia.7 
•  Older Age: Older age is associated with greater inflammation and age-related 
comorbidities. The presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6) increases 
hepcidin expression, likely placing older patients at higher risk of developing 
anaemia. Furthermore, sex hormone regulation is also impacted with older age, and 
both testosterone and oestrogen have been shown to reduce circulating hepcidin.2 
•  Female Gender: Despite lower Hb thresholds for anaemia diagnosis in females (<12 
g/dL vs. <13 g/dL for males), female patients with CKD tend to be at higher risk 
(~two times) of developing anaemia than their male counterparts.2 
•  Race and ethnicity: Prevalence of anaemia also varies among races and ethnic groups. 
Studies reported the prevalence of anaemia in the US population is almost 2 times 
higher in African Americans with CKD stages 3-4 (34.5%) than whites with CKD 
stages 3-4 (18.2%; P < 0.001).8 
Prevalence of Anaemia in CKD patients in European countries 
Prevalence of anaemia (Hb concentration below the <11 g/dL) in CKD patients on HD 
was 49%.9 
Prevalence of anaemia in non dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD CKD) 
patients for select few European countries, is presented in below Table 2.1-4.

Natural history of anaemia in CKD in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity: 
People with CKD are prone to develop a variety of complications, which reflect loss of 
endocrine and excretory function of the kidneys and decline of metabolic functions. The 
incidence and prevalence of these complications increase with severity of CKD as 
defined predominantly by GFR categories. 
The anaemia associated with CKD is usually normocytic and normochromic and without 
iron deficiency.7 Data consistently indicated that more severe CKD was associated with 
greater prevalence of anaemia. The development of anaemia in patients with CKD is 
driven by at least two factors. First, compared to patients without CKD, the kidneys of 
patients with CKD produce less EPO and second, hepcidin a hormone that (at high 
levels) impairs dietary iron absorption, is elevated in patients with CKD.2 Several other 
mechanisms of CKD related anaemia have been implicated including decreased RBC life 
span, chronic inflammation, metabolic abnormalities and effects of medications such as 
renin angiotensin system inhibitors.10 
a)  Mortality due to Anaemia in CKD 
Population-based studies have demonstrated an increased risk of death and cardiovascular 
(CV) mortality as GFR falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or when albumin is detected on 
Page 15 of 87 
 
urinalysis.11 Studies have shown that, the absolute risk for death increased exponentially 
with decreasing renal function.12 
Anaemia in CKD is associated with higher risks of all-cause mortality and CV mortality. 
These effects tend to increase with anaemia severity, such that a Hb < 10 g/dL was linked 
to comparable or higher risk of each outcome (all-cause mortality and CV mortality) than 
when compared to a Hb of 10-12 g/dL. 
Table 2.1-5 shows the Hazard Ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality and CV mortality in 
CKD patients with anaemia.

b)  Morbidity due to Anaemia in CKD 
A substantial body of evidence incriminates anaemia as a risk multiplier in CKD patients 
for major medical conditions, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke.13 
Inadequate treatment of anaemia may negatively affect cardiac function, cognitive 
function, physical capacity, and QoL in patients with CKD. 
Table 2.1-6 shows the HR of risk of hospitalisation, major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE) and CKD progression in CKD patients with anaemia.

Locatelli, F et al found that in five selected European countries (France, Germany, Italy, 
Spain, and UK) dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (DD CKD) patients with a Hb 
<10 g/dl were 29% more likely to be hospitalized than patients with a Hb of 11-12 g/dl 
(P<0.001).9 
i.  Cardiovascular diseases 
People with CKD are more likely to experience a CV event and a worse prognosis with 
higher mortality after an acute myocardial infarction (MI), and to have a higher risk of a 
recurrent MI, heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death.1 
Anaemia has been linked to CV outcomes, both in individuals with kidney failure and in 
the general population. In chronic anaemia, hypoxia and decreased blood viscosity result 
in decreased peripheral resistance and increased venous return, both of which increase 
cardiac output. This, in turn, may lead to progressive left ventricular enlargement which 
is a risk factor for CHD events.14 
Large cohort studies have demonstrated strong and independent associations between 
cardiovascular disease [CVD] (including acute coronary syndrome, stroke, HF and 
sudden cardiac death) and CKD by category of estimated GFR (eGFR), after adjusting 
for known CVD risk factors, a history of CVD events, and proteinuria. In those with an 
eGFR of 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, risk is increased by 43% and in those with eGFR 
<15 ml/min/1.73 m2, risk is increased by 343%.15 Although people with GFR category 
G5 (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at the highest risk of a CVD event, there will be 
more events in people with GFR categories G3a-G3b (GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
because of the much higher prevalence at these categories (0.3%-0.5% for G5 vs 5%-
10% for G3 stage of CKD).16 
ii. 
Peripheral arterial diseases (PAD) 
There is a strong link between CKD and PAD. Anaemia is common in CKD patients 
hospitalized for PAD. Anaemia is independently associated with overall adverse 
Page 17 of 87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outcomes for CKD as well as for the involved limbs in PAD. The risk of major 
amputation and death increases substantially at low levels of Hb.17 Overall, prevalence of 
PAD in subjects with GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 is 16%. Prevalence of PAD increased 
from 4% in those with GFR > 60 to 22% in those with GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
iii.  Risk of Infections 
CKD is associated with significant major infectious complications, which occur at rates 3 
to 4 times than in the general population. Patients with CKD are at increased risk for 
infection (attributable to immune dysfunction), increased exposure to infectious agents, 
loss of cutaneous barriers, comorbid conditions, and treatment-related factors (e.g., HD 
and immunosuppressant therapy). Because iron plays a vital role in pathogen 
reproduction and host immunity, it is biologically plausible that iron deficiency 
influences infection risk in CKD.18 Infection is an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality among patients with kidney failure and is the second leading cause of death 
following CVD. Data from the US Renal Data System (USRDS) suggest that higher rates 
(nearly 4 times) of hospital admission have occurred because of septicaemia in people 
with CKD compared with those without CKD.19 Rates for pneumonia in CKD were 
nearly three times higher than those for non-CKD. 
iv.  Risk of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) 
CKD is considered the most consistent pre-existing condition associated with AKI. 
Because AKI frequently develops in the ischaemic conditions, anaemia (with reduced 
oxygen delivery) can be one of the reasons for the high incidence of AKI in hospital-
admitted patients. It is helpful to monitor serum Hb or anaemia to prevent worse 
outcomes of AKI. Patients with both anaemia and AKI had a higher mortality risk 
because both anaemia and AKI aggravate organ dysfunction or delay of organ recovery.20 
v.  Major Neurological Problems 
Patients with CKD are frequently afflicted with neurological complications. These 
complications can potentially affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. 
Common neurological complications in CKD include stroke, cognitive dysfunction, 
encephalopathy, peripheral and autonomic neuropathies.21 CKD has been linked to 
higher stroke risk. The combination of CKD and anaemia was associated with a 
substantial increase in stroke risk, independent of other known risk factors for stroke.22 
c)  Co-morbidities in Patients with CKD and Anaemia  
i. 
Diabetes 
Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of CKD and kidney failure. Moderate to 
severe CKD is estimated to be found in 15-23% of patients with diabetes. For 45% of 
Page 18 of 87 
patients who receive dialysis therapy, diabetes is the primary cause of their kidney 
failure.23 
ii. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension and CKD are closely associated with an intermingled cause and effect 
relationship. Blood pressure (BP) typically rises with declines in kidney function, and 
sustained elevations in BP hasten progression of kidney disease. In a large health 
screening registry, individuals with a baseline BP close to 180/100 mm Hg were 
approximately 15 times more likely to develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than 
individuals with a baseline BP close to 110/70 mm Hg.24 Hypertension is present in 80-
85% adult patients with CKD. While the prevalence of hypertension in people without 
renal dysfunction is 60%, it can be as high as 90% in patients with chronic renal failure.25 
iii. 
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) 
CHF can cause or worsen both anaemia and CKD, and CKD can cause or worsen both 
anaemia and CHF. Thus, a vicious circle exists between these three conditions, with each 
causing or worsening the other. CHF is seen in up to 64% of patients referred to 
nephrologists with moderate to severe CKD.26 
iv. 
Liver Disorders 
According to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data of 
CKD patients in the United States (US) (1999 to 2016) the prevalence of liver disease 
was 3.44% in CKD patients of all stages. The prevalence of liver disease increases with 
severity of kidney dysfunction at least through Stage 4 (Table 2.1-7).27

In general, there is evidence of an association between CKD or decreased eGFR with 
liver enzyme changes or liver dysfunction. This may be due, at least in part, to the shared 
pathogenic mechanism between kidney and liver dysfunction like insulin resistance, 
lipotoxicity, inflammation and oxidative stress.28

Chronic viral hepatitis [due to Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)] can 
cause CKD and these infections can occur as a consequence of CKD management. CKD 
patients acquiring HBV or HCV infection have higher morbidity and mortality rates.29 
There is also evidence of an association with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
with CKD. 
v. 
Lung Disease 
The lungs may be severely affected by advanced CKD. However, the prevalence of lung 
dysfunction is increased even in patients with CKD stage 1-4, to 10% for restrictive and 
16% for obstructive lung function according to the NHANES 2007-2012. As GFR falls, 
pulmonary oedema and respiratory muscle dysfunction become more common due to 
fluid retention and metabolic, endocrine and CV alterations. Not only GFR but also 
urinary protein excretion may be linked to worsening lung function.30 
vi.  Malignancies 
Acute kidney injury and CKD encompasses a complex set of diseases that can both lead 
to, and result from cancer. Kidney dysfunction creates an inflammatory 
microenvironment and oxidative stress, which can establish the ideal environment for 
cancer development. In support of this hypothesis, patients with end-stage renal disease 
have a higher risk of developing cancer than individuals with normal kidney function. 
Many of the current and newly developed cancer chemotherapeutic agents are 
nephrotoxic and can promote kidney dysfunction. Patients with cancer often have kidney 
problems, including CKD or acute kidney injury.31 
After dialysis, cancer risk increases 10 to 80%, with relative risks (RR) significantly 
higher than the general population. There is also emerging evidence for an excess risk of 
cancer in patients at early CKD stages.32

Existing Treatment Options for Anaemia in CKD 
In the last 30 years, there has been a major transition in approach to the treatment of 
anaemia in people with CKD beginning with the introduction of EPO therapy into 
clinical practice and the subsequent resurgence of interest in iron therapies.1 
The current standard of care for anaemia secondary to CKD is the use of injectable 
erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) alone, or in combination with intravenous (IV) 
or oral iron supplementation.1 While ESAs have been shown to be effective in treating 
anaemia for many patients with CKD, they have some well-recognized limitations.33,34,35 
Treatment with exogenous recombinant ESAs is associated with shortcomings like the 
need for IV and/or subcutaneous administration and the potential for an unpredictable 
uncontrolled rise in Hb. Higher ESA doses and targeting near normal Hb levels with 
ESAs have been associated with excessive CV morbidity and mortality.33,34,35,36,37,38,39 
ESAs are associated with an increased risk of cancer progression or recurrence due to 
mechanisms that may be independent of the effect on Hb. The risk may be higher when 
Hb levels above 13 g/dL are achieved. In a few reported cases, EPO alfa induced 
antibodies have resulted in pure red cell aplasia, and dependence on blood transfusions to 
maintain acceptable Hb levels.40,41,42 RBC transfusions are typically used for rescue 
therapy rather than first-line therapy due to the risks of transfusion reactions, blood-borne 
infection, iron overload and circulatory overload. In addition, use of transfused blood 
products can increase the risk of alloimmunisation and hence organ rejection, which can 
impact candidacy for kidney transplantation. 
Roxadustat (brand name: Evrenzo), a HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor was approved in 
the Europe in August 2021 [Evrenzo | European Medicines Agency (EMA)] (europa.eu) 
as an alternative oral therapy option and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD. By inhibiting HIF prolyl-hydroxylase 
2, roxadustat activates HIF2a and thereby increases endogenous production of EPO 
which stimulates production of Hb and RBC.  
2.2 
Module SII: Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification 
Vadadustat is a small molecule inhibitor of HIF-PHs, which are enzymes that degrade the 
HIF-α subunit, leading to dose-dependent increases in EPO and other HIF-regulated 
genes involved in erythropoiesis and iron homeostasis. Vadadustat inhibits PHD 
enzymes, thereby stabilizing the 2 major human isoforms of the transcription factor 
HIF-α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) and contributing to increased EPO secretion. Repeat-dosing 
of vadadustat in mice and rats resulted in dose-dependent increases in several 
haematological markers, including EPO and Hb.

Table 2.2-1 below gives a summary of the key safety findings from non-clinical studies 
and relevance to human usage 
Table 2.2-1 
SII-1: Summary of Key Safety Findings from Non-clinical 
Studies and Relevance to Human Usage 
Key safety findings (from nonclinical studies) 
Safety pharmacology: 
Safety pharmacology of vadadustat was assessed 
in vitro and in vivo in rats and dogs. 
There were no vadadustat-related adverse effects 
on the rat CNS renal and respiratory function, no 
behavioural changes. Vadadustat had no clinically 
relevant effect in the in vitro hERG assay and did 
not cause clinically relevant changes in the ECG 
(RR-interval, QRS-complex, ST-segment or T-
wave) in rats or dogs. 
General Toxicology: 
The toxicology profile of vadadustat was 
evaluated in single- and repeat-dose studies in 
multiple species (mice, rats, dogs). 
In general, toxicities observed in toxicology 
studies were dose-responsive, reversing and 
consistent across species without appreciable 
progression of effects at increase in dosage 
duration. 
The majority of the toxicologic findings were due 
to exaggerated pharmacology of vadadustat 
(polycythemia/ hyperviscosity), which resulted in 
mortalities in all species at clinically relevant dose 
levels. 
A microscopic change unique to the dog was 
noted in the adrenal glands, and consisted of non-
proliferative mononuclear cell infiltrates, 
hypertrophied multinucleated cells, and/or single 
cell necrosis in the adrenal gland cortex of males 
dosed at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day and females dosed at 
≥ 25 mg/kg/day. These findings are likely 
sub-clinical given the few number of cells 
involved and were considered non-adverse. 
Reproductive / developmental toxicity: 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
including fertility, pregnancy and breastfeeding of 
vadadustat was evaluated in rats and rabbits. 
Vadadustat was not teratogenic in the rat or the 
rabbit and had no effect on fertility or embryonic 
development in the rat. There was a decrease in rat 
fetal body weight at 160 mg/kg/day, a dose that 
caused maternal toxicity. The reduced body 
weight corresponded with an increased incidence 
of reduced skeletal ossification. A 10-week 
juvenile toxicity study in 7-Day old Sprague 
Dawley (SD) rats did not reveal any new safety 
findings. 
Relevance to human usage 
No safety concern relevant to human use has 
arisen from these conventional safety 
pharmacology studies.  
The toxicities defining the NOAEL in the animal 
studies were secondary to polycythemia, an 
exaggerated pharmacological effect of vadadustat. 
Polycythaemia is clinically monitorable and will 
be managed in the clinical setting through dose 
titration to therapeutic Hb endpoints. 
In the pivotal clinical development studies in CKD 
patients adrenal disorders including adrenal 
insufficiency occurred in < 0.1% of patients; no 
difference in frequency of adrenal disorders as 
compared to comparator treatment darbepoetin 
alfa was observed. Overall, changes in adrenal 
gland are not considered relevant to humans. 
Nonclinical studies did not identify a risk for 
fertility, pregnancy or breastfeeding. There was 
limited experience in patients who were pregnant 
or breastfeeding during the vadadustat clinical 
development program. According to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics, vadadustat should only 
be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding if the 
benefit justifies a potential risk for the foetus. 
More information will be collected during ongoing 
clinical studies and in the post-marketing setting 
via routine pharmacovigilance activities.

Table 2.2-1 
SII-1: Summary of Key Safety Findings from Non-clinical 
Studies and Relevance to Human Usage 
Key safety findings (from nonclinical studies) 
Genotoxicity: 
Genotoxicity of vadadustat was assessed in vitro 
and in vivo in rats. 
Vadadustat was negative for mutagenicity, but 
positive results were obtained in the in vitro 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell assay for 
chromosomal aberrations and the GreenScreen 
assay. However, the in vivo chromosome 
aberration assay and COMET assays tested 
negative. 
Carcinogenicity: 
Carcinogenicity of vadadustat was evaluated in 
mice and rats. 
Vadadustat was not carcinogenic in a 6-month 
study in Tg-rasH2 mice and in a 2-year study in 
SD rats. 
Relevance to human usage 
The in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in 
CHO cells and the GreenScreen assay have been 
reported to have irrelevant positive results or to be 
heavily influenced by cytotoxicity. Thus, a 
positive result is often not predictive of a positive 
carcinogenic outcome. The in vivo chromosome 
aberration assay and COMET assays tested 
negative, and the Ames assay was negative.  
Overall, the weight of evidence suggests that 
vadadustat is not genotoxic and does not represent 
a genotoxic risk to humans. 
In preclinical tests no risk of carcinogenicity was 
identified. 
More information will be collected during ongoing 
clinical studies and in the post-marketing setting 
via routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
Malignancies are included in this RMP as a 
potential risk (risks not considered important).

Module SIV: Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials 
Two of the global Phase 3 studies (INNO2VATE: Study CI-0016 and Study CI-0017) 
were conducted in adult DD CKD subjects with baseline Hb values between 8 to 11 g/dL 
in Study CI-0016 and between 8 to 11 g/dL in the US and 9 to 12 g/dL outside of the US 
in Study CI-0017.  
Study CI-0016 included subjects with incident DD CKD who initiated dialysis within 16 
weeks of beginning their study participation. Study CI-0017 included subjects on chronic 
maintenance dialysis for more than 12 weeks and were being treated with an ESA for 
anaemia. 
Two of the global Phase 3 studies (PRO2TECT: Study CI-0014 and Study CI-0015) were 
conducted in adult NDD CKD subjects with baseline Hb values less than 10 g/dL and 
who were not being treated with an ESA.

SIV.1: Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the 
Development Programme 
Table 2.4.1-1 below shows the exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies 
Table 2.4.1-1 
SIV.1-1: Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies 
Exclusion Criterion 
Reason for Exclusion 
Anaemia due to cause 
other than CKD (e.g. 
haematologic 
malignancy). 
Anaemia from causes other than 
CKD would confound vadadustat 
results in the target population of 
patients with anaemia due to CKD 
Red blood cell 
transfusion within the 
last 8 weeks. 
Recent red blood cell transfusions 
prior to start of study medication 
influences baseline conditions 
Active malignancy or 
history of active 
malignancy within 
2 years. 
Recent cardiovascular 
or thromboembolic 
event, or severe 
concomitant cardiac 
disease (CHF NYHA 
class IV, acute 
coronary syndrome). 
Serious complications of end stage 
renal disease include an increased 
frequency of cancer, making 
evaluation of vadadustat difficult. 
Furthermore, active malignancies 
frequently cause anaemia (see 
above). 
Serious complications of ESRD 
include an increased frequency of 
cardiovascular disease and 
mortality, making evaluation of 
vadadustat difficult 
ALT, AST, or total 
bilirubin >2x upper 
limit of normal. 
Because liver function affects EPO 
production, including patients with 
abnormal liver function would 
make evaluation of vadadustat 
difficult 
Is it 
considered to 
be included as 
missing 
information? 
No 
No 
No 
No 
No 
Rationale 
If not included as Missing 
Information 
Anaemia associated with CKD 
is the target indication, and 
treatment of anaemia caused 
by other diseases is not an 
indication for vadadustat 
This exclusion criterion was 
introduced to avoid 
confounding effects on 
efficacy evaluation during 
early treatment phase. During 
the study rescue therapy with 
red blood cell transfusions was 
allowed. 
Malignancies is considered as 
a potential risk and will be 
monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance. (Note: 
there was no difference in the 
frequency of malignancies 
between vadadustat and the 
comparator in the Phase 3 
clinical trials) 
CKD itself is a risk factor for 
cardiovascular and 
thromboembolic events.  
Increased mortality, 
myocardial infarction, stroke 
and thromboembolism are 
included in Section 4.4 
(Special Warnings and 
precautions for use) in the 
SmPC. Furthermore, these 
safety concerns will continue 
to be monitored as Important 
identified risk. 
Liver disorders are known 
comorbidities in CKD patients.  
Elevated liver enzymes 
(includes transaminases 
increased, ALT increased, AST 
increased, hepatic enzyme 
increased), including,

Exclusion Criterion 
Reason for Exclusion 
Is it 
considered to 
be included as 
missing 
information? 
Uncontrolled 
hypertension 
History of prior organ 
transplantation or 
scheduled organ 
transplant. 
History of 
haemosiderosis or 
haemochromatosis. 
Females who are 
pregnant breast 
feeding; females of 
childbearing potential 
w/o contraception. 
Uncontrolled hypertension is 
considered a complication of 
CKD/ESRD. Serious 
complications of ESRD include an 
increased frequency of 
cardiovascular disease and 
mortality, making evaluation of 
vadadustat difficult 
Organ transplant and subsequent 
immunosuppression after 
transplantation confounds 
evaluation of safety and efficacy 
of investigational product.  
Iron overload independent from 
effect of vadadustat treatment  
Unknown benefit-risk in pregnant 
or breast-feeding women 
INNO2VATE only: 
Incident Dialysis: 
patients with ESA 
resistance <8 weeks of 
screening. 
Hypersensitivity 
ESA resistance <8 weeks of 
screening would make evaluation 
of the effect of vadadustat on Hb 
and RBC production difficult 
(note: rescue therapy with ESAs 
was allowed according to 
protocol) 
Avoid hypersensitivity reaction to 
any excipients of vadadustat 
preparation.

occasionally elevated bilirubin 
is considered as an Identified 
risk and mentioned in Sections 
4.2 (Posology and method of 
administration (Monitoring); 
Section 4.4 (Special warnings 
and precautions for use); and 
Section 4.8 (Undesirable 
effects) of the SmPC 
Worsening of hypertension is 
an identified risk, also

SIV.2: Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial 
Development Programmes 
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse 
reactions such as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those 
caused by prolonged or cumulative exposure.  
2.4.3 
SIV.3: Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically 
Underrepresented in Clinical Trial Development Programmes 
All subjects in the global Phase 3 studies by definition, had various degrees of renal 
insufficiency. Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been conducted with 
vadadustat in pregnant women. There is no data in humans regarding the effect of 
vadadustat in human milk, on the breastfed infant, or on milk production. The 
development and health benefits for the infant should be considered along with the 
mother’s clinical need for vadadustat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed 
infant. Vadadustat has not been studied in the paediatric population. 
Table 2.4.3-1 below shows the exposure of special populations included or not in the 
clinical trial development programme

Inclusion criterion in the development program. 
Therefore, all subjects in the global Phase 3 
studies by definition had various degrees of renal 
insufficiency 
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 
Studies, a total of 993 (13.4%) subjects with a 
NYHA HF class II or III were enrolled in the 
studies. 
Immunocompromised subjects were not evaluated 
in the clinical development programme 
Patients with a disease severity different from 
inclusion criteria in clinical trials were not 
included in the clinical development programme.  
Of note, only milder forms of CKD were not 
studied.

Module SV: Post-authorisation Experience 
A marketing authorisation for vadadustat for the indication of renal anaemia was received 
in Japan by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC) on 29 Jun 2020 (IBD). 
Vadadustat, under the trade name VAFSEO™, was launched in Japan on 26 Aug 2020. 
2.5.1 
SV.1: Post-authorisation Exposure 
2.5.1.1 
SV.1.1: Method Used to Calculate Exposure 
Vadadustat is approved in Japan as a film-coated, immediate-release tablet in the 
following strengths: 150 mg, 300 mg, and 450 mg. The starting dose of vadadustat in 
adult patients is 300 mg orally once daily. Thereafter, the dose may be adjusted according 
to the patient’s condition. The starting dose 300 mg once daily could be titrated up every 
4 weeks or down titrated at any time in increments of 150 mg with a maximum dose of 
Page 32 of 87 
 
 
600 mg once daily to achieve and maintain target Hb levels. There is no standard dosage 
or duration of treatment. Therefore, estimated patient-year (PY) exposure is calculated 
for each individual formulation of vadadustat and assumes that treated patients have 
taken one full tablet of vadadustat per day, which means the number of tablets sold for 
each formulation is equal to the patient-day exposure for that particular formulation. 
Since PY exposure is equal to patient-day exposure divided by 365 days, the PY 
exposure for each individual formulation of vadadustat is equal to the number of tablets 
sold divided by 365. It is noted that not all of the vadadustat tablets have as yet been 
delivered to patients as an inestimable amount could still be in the supply chain. 
It is important to note that the estimated patient years of treatment (PYT) are not 
equivalent to the absolute number of patients treated. It should also be noted that the 
overall PYT estimates are likely to underestimate the true number of patients exposed to 
vadadustat since PYT estimates reflect the number of patients who could have been 
treated for one year based on the tablets distributed. However, since many patients do not 
stay on therapy for a whole year, even for chronic conditions, the real number of patients 
is likely to be higher. Also to be noted, that at times PYT estimate can be overestimates, 
as there might be patients who end up taking 2 tablets per day to achieve desired 
recommended dosage. 
2.5.1.2 
SV.1.2: Exposure 
Due to the building of the supply chain and other factors that were associated with the 
launch of vadadustat, it is difficult to estimate patient exposure for vadadustat accurately. 
The shipment volumes of vadadustat tablets as of 28 June 2021 were 724,400 × 150 mg 
tablets and 1,020,100 × 300 mg tablets. The calculation of exposure is as follows: 
-  Total number of Tablets sold = 724,400 + 1,020,100 = 1,744,500 
-  Total patient days exposure = 1,744,500 
-  Estimated PYT = 1,744,500 ÷ 365 = 4779 PYT

Module SVI: Additional EU Requirements for the Safety 
Specification 
Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes 
HIF stabilizers as a class, based on their erythropoietic properties, can be the subject of 
misuse in amateur and elite sports to increase athletic performance. Hence, vadadustat 
was listed by World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as a prohibited substance for athletes 
in- and out-of-competition.43 
Page 33 of 87 
There were 15 events of suspected abuse or misuse of vadadustat reported in 7 subjects, 
and these were recorded as Special Situations in the global Phase 3 studies 
(Module 2.7.4 Section 5.6). Most of these special situation cases were reported as missed 
doses or taking more than prescribed doses and none of the special situations of suspected 
abuse/misuse led to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and none of them were 
considered misuse for illegal purposes 
Post-marketing Data (Japan Only):  
As of the data cut-off date of 18 Aug 2021, no case reports of drug misuse or drug abuse 
have been received. 
More information will be collected in the post-marketing setting via routine 
pharmacovigilance (PV) activities to monitor the misuse or abuse potential of vadadustat.

Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
2.7.1 
SVII.1: Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP 
Submission 
The initial identification of safety concerns with the first submission of this RMP is 
presented in the following sections. 
2.7.1.1 
SVII.1.1: Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the 
List of Safety Concerns in the RMP 
The risks not taken forward as safety concerns are presented below. 
Reason(s) for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP: 
(a) Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the 
indication treated) 
•  Drug-drug interaction with iron supplements and phosphate binders (both 
iron and non-iron containing) (Identified Risk) 
Based on structural attributes, absorption of vadadustat may be affected due to complex 
formation with phosphate binders or iron. This could lead to reduced absorption of 
vadadustat in the presence of high doses of concomitantly administered oral iron alone or 
iron/non-iron containing phosphate binders. 
Study CI-0037 showed that there was moderate interaction when 300 mg vadadustat was 
administered with a non-iron-containing phosphate binder (1600 mg sevelamer carbonate 
and 1334 mg calcium acetate), reducing exposure up to 55%, and iron-containing 
phosphate binder (2 g ferric citrate), reducing exposure up to 90% (Module 2.7.2 
Page 34 of 87 
Section 1.3.1.6). The interaction with non-iron containing phosphate binders can be 
reduced by administering vadadustat 1 hour prior to or 2 hours after binder 
administration.44 
Study CI-0012 and Study MT-6548-J05, showed that maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the concentration curve (AUC) values for vadadustat were reduced 
by 50% up to 90% (Module 2.7.2 Sections 2.2.4.7 and Section 2.2.4.1), when dosed 
concomitantly with ferrous sulfate immediate release tablet or with the co-administration 
of oral iron or iron-containing phosphate binders (sodium ferrous citrate, ferric citrate 
hydrate, sucroferric oxyhydroxide). It is recommended that vadadustat be administered at 
least 1 hour prior to oral iron supplements, products containing iron or iron-containing 
phosphate binders.45,46 
•  Drug-drug interaction with OAT 3, OAT1/3 and BCRP substrates (Identified 
Risk) 
In vitro data suggests vadadustat is a substrate of organic anion transporter (OAT)1/3 and 
an inhibitor of the organic anion transporter OAT3 and also clinically relevant inhibitor 
of the drug transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). (Module 2.7.2 Sections 
2.2.4.4).47 
Exposure of sulfasalazine (a BCRP substrate) increased 4.5-fold48 and furosemide (an 
OAT1/OAT3 substrate) increased 2-fold49 when co-administered with vadadustat in 
healthy subjects (Module 2.7.2 Section 2.2.4.4 and Section 2.2.4.5). However, no effect 
was observed on the exposure of adefovir (an OAT1 substrate) (Module 2.7.2 Section 
2.2.4.5) indicating, that clinically, vadadustat is an OAT3 inhibitor.49 Exposure of 
vadadustat increased approximately 2-fold when co-administered with probenecid (a 
general UGT and OAT1/3 inhibitor).(Module 2.7.2 Section 2.2.4.3).50 
In the above drug-drug interaction studies none of the observed TEAEs were serious or 
led to discontinuation from study drug or led to death. 
Available information regarding the risk of interaction with vadadustat and the drugs 
acting on OAT3 or BCRP substrate has not impacted the overall positive benefit-risk 
balance for vadadustat. 
It is recommended to monitor for signs of excessive effects of the co-administered OAT3 
and BCRP substrates. If co-administrated with strong or moderate OAT1 or OAT3 
inhibitors, patients should be managed cautiously and evaluated for excessive effects of 
vadadustat. See Section 4.5 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
(Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction).

•  Elevated Liver Enzymes (Identified Risk) 
Elevated liver enzymes were captured in the development programme in two separate 
ways, (i) as adverse events reported by investigators or (ii) as specific elevations of liver 
enzymes above the upper limit of normal (ULN). 
In the pooled DD-CKD Population, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) preferred terms (PTs) for elevated liver enzymesb were reported in 3.2% of 
subjects receiving vadadustat and 3.7% of subjects receiving darbepoetin alfa treatment. 
Based on laboratory data, in the pooled DD-CKD population the elevated serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) (3x ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (3x ULN), and 
bilirubin (2x ULN) were seen in 1.8%, 1. 4% and 0.3% of patients treated with 
vadadustat, respectively and in pooled CKD population 
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 Studies, MedDRA PTs for elevated 
liver enzymes were reported in 3% of subjects receiving vadadustat and 3.2% of subjects 
receiving darbepoetin alfa treatment.Based on laboratory data, elevated serum ALT (3x 
ULN), AST (3x ULN), and bilirubin (2x ULN) were seen in 1.8%, 1.8% and 0.1% of 
patients treated with vadadustat, respectively in the pooled CKD population. 
All of the liver enzyme abnormalities resolved or were resolving, and no instances of 
acute liver failure, death attributed to vadadustat or the development of chronic liver 
disease were observed. Although incidence of elevated liver enzymes was similar 
between the two treatment groups, per investigator assessment, more events were 
considered related to vadadustat than darbepoetin alfa. 
Based on the data from clinical development and post-marketing reports, elevated liver 
enzymes (includes transaminases increased, ALT increased, AST increased, hepatic 
enzyme increased), including, occasionally elevated bilirubin is considered an identified 
risk for vadadustat. Elevated liver enzymes and increased blood bilirubin are listed in 
Section 4.8 and are mentioned in Section 4.2, Section 4.4 of the SmPC. Routine risk 
communication and minimisation measures will ensure the overall public health impact 
of this risk is low. 
•  Worsening of Hypertension (Identified Risk) 
In the pooled DD-CKD Population, a total of 333 (14.3%) subjects experienced an event 
of hypertension [Standardised MedDRA query (SMQ) Hypertension, broad] in the 
b Alanine aminotransferase increased, Aspartate aminotransferase increased, Transaminases increased, Hepatic enzyme 
increased, Liver function test abnormal 
Page 36 of 87 
 
vadadustat treatment group compared with 389 (18.4%) subjects in the darbepoetin alfa 
treatment group (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a).  
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 Studies, a total of 663 (18.0%) subjects 
experienced an event of hypertension [Standardised MedDRA query (SMQ) 
Hypertension, broad] in the vadadustat treatment group compared with 776 (21.0%) 
subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group. The RR (95% CI) of 
vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa was 0.86 (0.78, 0.94). The most frequently reported PTs for 
hypertension adverse events of special interest (AESI) were hypertension, hypertensive 
urgency, hypertensive crisis, and increased blood pressure. (ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). 
Most events in both treatment groups (77.8%) had an outcome recovered/resolved. 
Ninety-six percent of events in the vadadustat treatment group were reported as unrelated 
compared to 95.4% of events reported as unrelated in the darbepoetin alfa treatment 
group. 
Most patients had several confounding factors and co-morbidities associated with the 
worsening BP control, including smoking, underlying CKD, diabetes mellitus, peripheral 
arterial occlusive disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), CHF, and inadequately 
controlled hypertension at baseline. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): As of 18 Aug 2021, 22 spontaneous case reports with 
22 MedDRA PTs under the SMQ Hypertension (broad) were reported. With an estimate 
of 4779 PYT of exposure this calculates to a reporting rate of 0.460 adverse events / 100 
PYT. The reported terms were hypertension (10 case reports), BP increased (11) and BP 
systolic increased (1). Two case reports were serious (one report each of hypertension 
and BP increased) and no case with fatal outcome was reported. In 12 cases in which 
information about the patients’ medical history was available, the patients had underlying 
hypertension. 
This safety concern is considered as an identified risk with low public health impact 
because of possible early detection and management. According to the SmPC 
Section 4.4, administration of vadadustat in patients with CKD may be associated with 
worsening of hypertension. Hypertension is also listed in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Routine risk communication and minimisation measures will ensure the overall public 
health impact of this risk is low. 
•  Malignancies (Potential Risk) 
CKD and cancer are interconnected in many ways: cancer can cause CKD directly or 
indirectly, through cancer therapy (chemotherapy nephrotoxicity) whereas CKD may 
conversely be a risk factor for cancer. Based on US Renal Data System (1998 to 2002) 
Page 37 of 87 
cancer prevalence data, 31% of subjects with ESRD had a diagnosis of cancer at least 2 
years before start of ESRD treatment. Cancers most strongly associated with dialysis 
include Kaposi sarcoma, tumours of the oral cavity, kidney, bladder, stomach, liver, lung, 
cervix, and thyroid.32 
In the global Phase 3 clinical studies in DD CKD and NDD CKD, 132 malignancies 
related events were reported in 121 subjects out of 3686 subjects (PY=6335.3) exposed to 
vadadustat treatment. The IR of malignancies related events in the global Phase 3 clinical 
studies was 3.3% (2.1 events per 100 PY) (ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). In the Phase 3 clinical 
trials the most frequently reported malignancies were non-melanoma skin cancers [basal 
cell carcinoma (0.4%) and squamous cell carcinoma (0.4%)]. 
Pooled DD CKD Population for the Phase 3 Studies: 
A total of 47 (2.4%) subjects experienced an event of malignant or unspecified tumours 
in the vadadustat treatment group compared with 66 (3.4%) subjects in the darbepoetin 
alfa treatment group. The RR (95% CI) of vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa was 0.72 [0.49, 
1.03]). Cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were reported for 0.1% of subjects in the 
vadadustat treatment group and 0.2% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group. 
(ISS Table 14.3.1.13a). 
Pooled NDD CKD Population for the Phase 3 Studies: 
A total of 74 (4.3%) subjects experienced an event of malignant or unspecified tumours 
in the vadadustat treatment group compared with 83 (4.8%) subjects in the darbepoetin 
alfa treatment group. The RR (95% CI) of vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa was 0.89 [0.65, 
1.21). The most frequent PTs were non-melanoma skin cancer [basal cell carcinoma 
(BCC): 0.8% and 0.7% of subjects in the vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa treatment 
groups, respectively and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin: 0.8% and 0.6% of 
subjects, respectively]. Cases of RCC were reported for 0.0% of subjects in the 
vadadustat treatment group and 0.1% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group. 
(ISS Table 14.3.1.13b). 
Pooled CKD Population for the Phase 3 Studies: 
A total of 121 (3.3%) subjects experienced an event of malignant or unspecified tumours 
in the vadadustat treatment group compared with 149 (4.0%) subjects in the darbepoetin 
alfa treatment group. The RR (95% CI) of vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa was 0.81 [0.64, 
1.03). Cases of RCC were reported for 0.1% of subjects in the vadadustat and 
darbepoetin alfa treatment groups. (ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). 
Page 38 of 87 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): As of 18 Aug 2021, four cases of malignancies (SMQ 
Malignant or Unspecified Tumors, broad) have been reported (0.0837 AE / 100 PYT; 4 
were serious and 2 had a fatal outcome). The adverse events (AEs) reported were acute 
myeloid leukaemia, renal cancer (recurrence), hepatic cancer (recurrence), hepatic 
neoplasm. All reported malignancies were reported with a short latency (few months) to 
start of vadadustat treatment and/or were reoccurrences of pre-existing malignancies. As 
such a causal relationship between vadadustat and the reported malignancies is 
implausible. 
At this time, there is little evidence suggesting that the transient stabilization of HIF-α via 
the pharmacological inhibition of PHD enzymes correlates with tumorigenesis. While the 
existing clinical and nonclinical data for vadadustat do not suggest that the transient and 
temporal pharmacologic activation of HIF through the inhibition of PHDs causes 
tumorigenesis, a link cannot be ruled out.  
In consideration of this and high background incidence of malignancies in the target 
population the public health impact is considered to be low. This safety concern is 
considered as a potential risk and will be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance. 
All cases of malignancy will be evaluated and included in Periodic Safety Update 
Reports (PSUR). 
•  Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with concomitant use of specific statins 
(rosuvastatin and simvastatin) (Potential Risk): 
In vitro data indicates that vadadustat is an inhibitor of BCRP and OATP1B1, which are 
liver uptake transporters. Rosuvastatin is a substrate for BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3. 
Simvastatin is a substrate for BCRP and OATP1B1. However, vadadustat had no 
interaction with the OATP1B1/3 substrate pravastatin. Interactions with vadadustat via 
BRCP may result in increased blood levels of the simvastatin and rosuvastatin 
(Module 2.7.2 Section 2.2.4.4).47 
In the global Phase 3 clinical studies for subjects taking vadadustat concomitantly with 
any statins (1998 subjects; PY=3590.2), there were a total of 14 subjects (IR: 0.7%; 
0.4 event per 100 PY) who experienced rhabdomyolysis (13 subjects) or myopathy 
(1 subject) (ISS Table 14.3.1.2.6c). Seven of the subjects received atorvastatin 
concomitantly, 4 simvastatin, 2 pravastatin and 1 rosuvastatin. However, cases of 
rhabdomyolysis (as identified with the SMQ rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, narrow) were 
also observed in patients who did not receive concomitant statins and/or in patients 
randomized to darbepoetin alfa. An overview of the incidence of 
rhabdomyolysis/myopathy in Global Phase 3 studies is provided in Table 2.7.1.1-1.

Pooled DD CKD Population for the Phase 3 Studies: 
In the pooled DD CKD population for the Phase 3 studies, 943 subjects (PY=1644.8), 
were exposed to vadadustat concomitantly with any statins. Of these, 850 subjects 
(90.1%) experienced any TEAE. For darbepoetin alfa 969 subjects (PY=1667.5) were 
exposed to any statin concomitantly. Of these 894, subjects (92.3%) experienced any 
TEAE (ISS Table 14.3.1.2.6a). The distribution of these TEAEs were qualitatively 
similar in both the treatment arms.  
In the DD CKD population in the Phase 3 studies of vadadustat cases of rhabdomyolysis 
(SMQ rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, narrow) were observed in both (darbepoetin and 
vadadustat) study arms as well as in subjects with and without concomitant statin. An 
overview of the incidence of rhabdomyolysis/myopathy in the pooled DD-CKD 
population is outlined in Table 2.7.1.1-2.

A search for TEAEs belonging to the SMQ rhabdomyolysis/myopathy (narrow) revealed 
a total of 5 TEAEs of rhabdomyolysis in 5 unique subjects (no case report of myopathy). 
There was 1 TEAE reported by the investigator as SAE (severe; outcome was recovered). 
The remaining 4 TEAEs were reported as non-serious adverse events (NSAEs) (3 were 
moderate and 1 was mild in severity). Action taken with vadadustat was no change in 4 
subjects and was not applicable for remaining 1 subject. Causality for the reported events 
rhabdomyolysis was assessed as not related with vadadustat treatment by the study 
investigator.

Pooled NDD CKD Population for the Phase 3 Studies: 
In the pooled NDD CKD population for the Phase 3 studies, 1055 subjects (PY=1945.4) 
were exposed to vadadustat concomitantly with any statins. Of these 976 subjects 
(92.5%) experienced any TEAE. For darbepoetin alfa 1042 subjects (PY=1949.4) were 
exposed to any statin concomitantly. Of these 966 subjects (92.7%) experienced any 
TEAE (ISS Table 14.3.1.2.6b). The distribution of these TEAE were qualitatively similar 
in both the treatment arms.  
In the NDD CKD population in the phase 3 Studies of vadadustat cases of 
rhabdomyolysis (SMQ rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, narrow) were observed in both 
(darbepoetin alfa and vadadustat) study arms as well as in subject with and without 
concomitant statin. An overview of the incidence of rhabdomyolysis/myopathy in the 
pooled NDD CKD population is outlined in Table 2.7.1.1-4.

Of the 976 TEAEs in the vadadustat treatment arm, a search for TEAEs belonging to 
SMQ rhabdomyolysis/ myopathy (narrow), revealed a total of 9 TEAEs in 9 unique 
subjects. There were 8 TEAEs of rhabdomyolysis, out of which 5 were reported as 
serious adverse events (SAEs) by investigator (2 were severe and 3 were of moderate 
severity) and 3 were reported as NSAEs(1 was moderate and 2 were mild in severity). 
One TEAE was non-serious myopathy (moderate in severity). All these 9 events of 
rhabdomyolysis or myopathy recovered and were assessed as unrelated to vadadustat. 
Study drug vadadustat was withdrawn in 2 subjects, was interrupted in 1 subject, while in 
5 subjects no change was made to vadadustat dosage regimen. In the remaining 1 subject, 
action taken with study drug was not applicable.

* Only case of Myopathy, remaining 8 cases were for rhabdomyolysis 
Investigator determined causality for all cases were `not-related’ with the use of vadadustat; all 
events were resolved 
Outcome in all the cases of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy was `recovered’ 
Pooled CKD Population for the Phase 3 Studies: 
In the pooled CKD population for the Phase 3 studies, in vadadustat treatment arm, a 
search for TEAEs belonging to SMQ rhabdomyolysis/myopathy (narrow) revealed a total 
of 14 TEAEs in 14 unique subjects (IR: 0.7%; 0.4 event per 100 PY). There were 13 
TEAEs of rhabdomyolysis and 1 TEAE of myopathy. All these 14 events of 
rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were assessed by the study investigator as unrelated to 
vadadustat and had confounding factors such as co-existing illnesses and concomitant 
medications. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): In the post-marketing setting no case of 
rhabdomyolysis (SMQ rhabdomyolysis/ myopathy, narrow) in patients with concomitant 
statin use was reported. 
Considering low observed frequency in clinical program and appropriate routine risk 
minimisation measures and communication, the overall impact on the public health is 
considered to be low. This safety concern is considered as a potential risk and will be 
monitored through routine pharmacovigilance. All cases of myopathy and 
Page 43 of 87 
rhabdomyolysis with concomitant use of specific statins (rosuvastatin and simvastatin) 
will be evaluated and included in PSUR. 
Thromboembolic Events (Including Myocardial Infarction and Stroke) (Identified 
Risk) 
Vascular thrombosis is a theoretical risk from stabilisation of HIF-α and the resulting 
increase in erythropoiesis. In nonclinical toxicology studies, vascular thrombosis was 
attributed to the exaggerated pharmacological response resulting in polycythemia, blood 
hyperviscosity, and the formation of fibrin thrombi in multiple organs. Adverse 
consequences associated with the exaggerated pharmacology in rodents included 
increased mortality, accompanied by haemorrhage, thrombosis, and organ infarction due 
to increased blood viscosity. In mice, associated fibrin thrombosis or necrosis in the 
kidney and heart were seen. 
Pooled DD CKD Population for the Phase 3 Studies: 
In the pooled DD CKD population for the Phase 3 studies, 267 thromboembolic events 
were reported for 1947 subjects (IR: 13.7%; 11.5 events per 100 PY) in vadadustat 
treatment arm compared to 234 thromboembolic events for 1955 subjects (IR: 12%; 11.3 
events per 100 PY) in darbepoetin alfa treatment group. Acute myocardial infarction 
(4.5%), cerebrovascular accident (0.8%), and transient ischaemic attack (0.8%) were 
reported in the vadadustat treatment group, along with other thromboembolic events. 
(ISS Table 14.3.1.3a). 
Pooled NDD CKD Population for the Phase 3 Studies: 
In the pooled NDD CKD population for the Phase 3 studies, 120 thromboembolic events 
were reported for 1739 subjects (IR: 6.9%; 4.5 events per 100 PY) in vadadustat 
treatment arm compared to 118 thromboembolic events for 1732 subjects (IR: 6.8%; 4.5 
events per 100 PY) in darbepoetin alfa. The most frequently reported PTs for vadadustat 
treatment group were acute myocardial infarction (4%), cerebrovascular accident (0.9%) 
and transient ischaemic attack (0.8%). 
(ISS Table 14.3.1.3.1.2b) 
Pooled CKD Population for the Phase 3 Studies: 
In the pooled CKD population for the Phase 3 studies, 387 thromboembolic events were 
reported for 3686 subjects (IR:10.5%; 8.1 events per 100 PY) in vadadustat treatment 
arm compared to 352 thromboembolic events for 3687 subjects (IR: 9.5%; 7.9 events per 
100 PY) in darbepoetin alfa. The most frequently reported PTs for vadadustat treatment 
Page 44 of 87 
group were acute myocardial infarction (4.2%), cerebrovascular accident (0.9%) and 
transient ischaemic attack (0.8%). (ISS Table 14.3.1.3.1.2c) 
Major Adverse Cardiac Events: 
In the global Phase 3 clinical studies, composite MACE including CV and thrombotic 
events were analysed as a primary safety endpoint. The MACE analysis was conducted in 
the safety data from the global Phase 3 CKD patient population who received at least 1 
dose of study drug. 
An independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) was implemented to ensure 
that all potential endpoints were judged on a blinded basis and uniformly using the same 
criteria. The EAC adjudicated all potential AEs that met the criteria of a MACE (death, 
stroke, myocardial infarction) or other events requiring adjudication (hospitalisation for 
heart failure, thromboembolic event), in the adjudication database. A programmatic 
review of the reported AE terms was utilised to determine whether there were any AEs 
that may be potential events for adjudication that were not reported. 
The MACE analyses focused on statistical evaluation of major cardiac events including 
death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke (primary MACE endpoint), as well as other CV 
related events, and sensitivity analyses were performed using the intent-to-treat 
population. (Combined MACE report) 
The adjudication database differs from the clinical database regarding investigator-
reported terms and included potential endpoints that were manually entered as identified 
by the EAC or SMQ reconciliation process, that may or may not have been 
acknowledged by the site. 
Overall, thromboembolic events were reported at low frequency in the pivotal Phase 3 
clinical development programme. The frequency of thromboembolic events was lower in 
NDD CKD patients (2%) than in DD CKD patients (8.1%) in the respective pooled 
global Phase 3 trials. 
•  MACE Analysis of Pooled NDD CKD Phase 3 Population 
In the NDD CKD population, thromboembolic events [including PTs: vascular access 
thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE)] 
were reported for 1.9% of subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and 2.2% of 
subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group. In addition, non-fatal MI was reported in 
3.9% and nonfatal stroke was reported in 2% subjects in vadadustat treatment arm 
compared with 2.8% non-fatal MI and 1.6% non-fatal stroke in darbepoetin alfa treatment 
arm. 
Page 45 of 87 
The number of subjects with any MACE, and MACE per 100 PY for the individual 
components of MACE (death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke) were higher in the 
vadadustat treatment group (382 subjects out of 1739 subjects, IR 22%; 13.9 events per 
100 PY) than the darbepoetin alfa treatment group (344 subjects out of 1732 subjects, IR 
19.9%; 12.4 events per 100 PY).  
In the NDD CKD studies, non-inferiority was not met for the primary safety outcome of 
time to first MACE, as the upper limit of the 95% CI was 1.355. For all key secondary 
MACE end points the upper bound of the 95% CI was below the non-inferiority limit of 
<1.30 except for the composite endpoint of time to CV MACE, i.e., CV death, non-fatal 
MI, and non-fatal stroke (HR 1.16; 95% CI: 0.947, 1.420). (Module 2.5 Table 16) 
For composite CV MACE, the incidence of `CV death’ was lower in vadadustat treatment 
arm (7.3%) compared with the darbepoetin alfa treatment group (7.6%). However, 
subjects with non-fatal MI (3.9% vs 2.8%) and non-fatal stroke (2%vs 1.6%) were higher 
for the vadadustat treatment group compared with the darbepoetin alfa treatment group.57 
Regional differences in treatment care were observed between the US and ex-US 
populations impacting the overall HR. The NDD CKD population in the US region is 
more homogenous, with a consistent standard of care, and had consistent MACE results 
between studies CI-0014 (correction) and CI-0015 (conversion). Marked inconsistencies 
were observed in the regions of Europe and ROW between studies CI-0014 and CI-0015. 
These data are confounded by a heterogeneous population at baseline, differences in 
regional treatment care, and a pre-selection of subjects stable on darbepoetin alfa at 
baseline in Europe.  
The observed MACE rate with darbepoetin alfa showed wide variability, MACE rate in 
darbepoetin alfa treated patients was 22.7% in the US and 18.4% in ROW. However, in 
Europe, the most notable observation was that MACE rate for darbepoetin alfa treated 
subjects was lower (14.2%) which impacted the overall HR for vadadustat compared to 
darbepoetin alfa. This lower rate increased the overall HR for the NDD CKD population 
and was influenced by the fact that 61% of subjects in Europe had previously received 
darbepoetin alfa prior to being enrolled into the conversion trial under the NDD CKD 
program. Subjects that converted from a low dose of ESA to a same or equivalent dose of 
darbepoetin alfa may have been more clinically stable. These differences may have 
contributed to the unexpectedly low rate of MACE (11.4%) in the darbepoetin alfa group, 
given that ESAs are standard of care for patients with anaemia of CKD, physicians are 
familiar with managing ESA changes and there are well-established conversion 
algorithms.

•  MACE analysis of Pooled DD CKD Phase 3 Population 
In DD CKD patient population, thromboembolic events were reported for 8.7% of 
subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and 7.6% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa 
treatment group. In addition, non-fatal MI was reported in 4.2% and non-fatal stroke was 
reported in 1.6% subjects in vadadustat treatment arm compared with 4.5% non-fatal MI 
and 2.2% non-fatal stroke in darbepoetin alfa treatment arm. 
The number of subjects with any MACE, and MACE per 100 PY for the individual 
components of MACE (death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke) were similar in the 
vadadustat (355 subjects out of 1947 subjects, IR 18.2%; 13.2 events per 100 PY) and 
darbepoetin alfa (377 subjects out of 1955 subjects, IR 19.3%; 14.2 events per 100 PY) 
treatment groups. 
The HR 95% [CI]) for the time to first MACE for vadadustat compared to darbepoetin 
alfa was 0.96 (0.833, 1.113). The upper bound of the 95% CI of the HR was below the 
prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.30 for the EMA, thereby establishing 
non-inferiority of vadadustat to darbepoetin alfa. The analyses of key secondary 
endpoints using expanded MACE (MACE plus hospitalisation for heart failure or 
thromboembolic events excluding vascular access thrombosis), CV MACE, CV deaths, 
and all-cause mortality also demonstrated non-inferiority of vadadustat to darbepoetin 
alfa (HR [95% CI]: 0.96 [0.840, 1.096], 0.95 [0.795, 1.144], 0.96 [0.766, 1.195], and 0.95 
[0.812, 1.118], respectively.58 
The safety profile of vadadustat was comparable to that of darbepoetin alfa in the DD 
CKD population and demonstrated non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa in time to first 
MACE, regardless of geographic region. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): As of 18 Aug 2021, thirteen post-marketing cases were 
reported with 13 thromboembolic adverse events (SMQ Embolic and Thrombotic 
Events). Twelve of these cases reported serious adverse events, and 2 had a fatal outcome 
(2 myocardial infarctions; see Table 2.7.1.1-78). With an estimate of 4779 PYT this 
calculates to an estimate of 0.272 adverse events / 100 PYT. 
The reported serious events were myocardial infarction/acute myocardial infarction (4), 
cerebral infarction (6), pulmonary embolism (1), pulmonary infarction (1) Two cases 
with serious and fatal thromboembolic events are discussed below.

With routine risk minimisation measures and appropriate communication, the overall 
impact on the public health is considered to be low. 
(b) Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a 
low frequency and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the

•  Hypersensitivity (Identified Risk) 
In the pooled DD-CKD Population, a total 8.0% of subjects in the vadadustat treatment 
group and 8.7% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group experienced an event 
of hypersensitivity (SMQ Hypersensitivity, broad) (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 Studies a total 7.7% of subjects in the 
vadadustat treatment group and 7.9% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group 
experienced an event of hypersensitivity (SMQ Hypersensitivity, broad). The RR (95% 
CI) of vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa was 0.97 (0.83, 1.13) (ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). Most of 
these events (93%) were NSAEs and were assessed as unrelated (94.6%) to study drug. 
Reports of anaphylactic reaction were rare in both the vadadustat treatment group (3 
subjects) and darbepoetin alfa treatment group (2 subjects). All reported anaphylactic 
reactions were assessed as unrelated, except one case with vadadustat where possibility 
of reasonable causal relationship could not be ruled out. However, in this case there were 
possible confounders including the subject’s medical history of allergy and underlying 
systemic lupus erythematosus, which predisposes patients to higher level of 
hypersensitivity to exogenous antigens. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): As of 18 Aug 2021, 39 spontaneous case reports with 
42 adverse events (MedDRA PTs) under the SMQ Hypersensitivity (broad) were 
Page 49 of 87 
 
 
reported. With an estimate of 4779 PYT of exposure this calculates to a reporting rate of 
0.879 adverse events / 100 PYT.  
Two cases reported 3 serious adverse events (MedDRA PTs of shock, drug reaction with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and drug eruption); one of these cases had 
a fatal outcome: 
-  A 
 patient was reported with 
) and approximately 3 months after start of treatment with 
vadadustat; the reporting physician considered the AE not related to vadadustat and 
the event is suggestive of an accident. 
-  A patient with a medical history of 
 was reported with a serious adverse 
 and 
events of 
with vadadustat. The events were considered causally related to vadadustat by the 
reporter as well by the Marketing Authorisation Holder.  
 approximately 2 months after start of treatment 
Based on above data from clinical development and post-marketing setting, 
hypersensitivity will continue to be monitored as an identified risk of vadadustat. 
Vadadustat is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or 
any of the excipients of the product (SmPC Section 4.3). Routine risk communication and 
minimisation measures will ensure the overall public health impact of this risk is low. 
(c) Other reasons for considering the risks not important 
•  Adrenal disorders 
In the pooled DD-CKD Population, adrenal disorders, including events of adrenal 
insufficiency, were rare (0.1%) and occurred in the same proportion of subjects in both 
vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa treatment groups (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
Adrenal gland histologic findings (non-proliferative mononuclear infiltrates, 
hypertrophied multinucleated cells, and single cell necrosis) have been noted in 
vadadustat dog toxicology studies of ≥14 days duration, which were considered 
subclinical, reversible, non-adverse and unique to dog adrenal glands. 
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 Studies, adrenal disorders, including 
events of adrenal insufficiency, were rare (<0.1%) and occurred in the same proportion of 
subjects in both vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa treatment groups (ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). 
Within adrenal disorder medical topic [High Level Term (HLT)- Adrenal Gland 
Disorders] a total of 4 cases of adrenal mass were seen in the vadadustat treatment group, 
all were assessed as non-serious and mild. Events were assessed as not related and 
attributed to incidental findings or ESRD. In addition, a total of 2 serious events of 
Page 50 of 87 
 
adrenal insufficiency (out of 5) were seen in the vadadustat treatment group. Both events 
were assessed as unrelated as they were attributed to either low cortisol at baseline or 
weaning of ongoing cortisol treatment. There were no reports of decreased sodium or 
chloride, or increased potassium. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): As of 18 Aug 2021, no case with events from the 
MedDRA HLT adrenal gland disorders has been reported. 
In view of the above findings adrenal disorders do not impact the overall risk benefit 
profile of vadadustat. 
•  Retinopathy 
In in vitro and animal studies, HIF stabilisation has been demonstrated to increase the 
serum levels of the pro-angiogenic protein vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF).52,53 Retinal-related TEAEs including deterioration of the pre-existing retinal 
disorders, may theoretically be associated with HIF stabilisation. In humans, higher 
intraocular levels of HIF and VEGF have been associated with retinopathy. However, 
minimal evidence is available, from clinical studies, to support the theory of retinal 
effects due to HIF stabilisation and subsequent increase in VEGF. 
Fundoscopic examinations performed in the regional Phase 3 Japanese studies revealed 
retinal haemorrhage reported for 2 (4.8%) vadadustat-treated subjects, and macular 
degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, and macular fibrosis reported for 1 (2.4%) subject 
each in Study MT-6548-J02 (single-arm study of vadadustat) (MT-6548-J02 
Appendix 16.2.7). 
In the pooled DD-CKD Population, adverse events under the SMQ Retinal Disorders 
(narrow) were reported for 2.6 % of subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and 2.4% 
of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group (RR 1.107, CI 0.7652, 1.6014). A total 
of 77 events were reported for vadadustat under medical topic retinal effects due to 
VEGF expression from 61 unique subjects (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 Studies, adverse events under the SMQ 
Retinal Disorders (narrow) were reported for 2.0% of subjects in the vadadustat treatment 
group and 2.1% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group (RR 0.937, CI 0.6846, 
1.2823; ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). A total of 91 events were reported for vadadustat under 
medical topic retinal effects due to VEGF expression from 74 unique subjects. Of these 
majority (~95%) of events were non-serious. No evidence was found to support an 
association between vadadustat and retinal-related TEAEs. 
Page 51 of 87 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): As of 18 Aug 2021, four spontaneous case reports with 
4 events under the SMQ Retinal Disorders (broad) were reported. With an estimate of 
4779 PYT of exposure this calculates to a reporting rate of 0.084 adverse events reports / 
100 PYT. Of the 4 case reports, there was 1 serious case, and no case had a fatal 
outcome. 
The reported PTs were retinal vascular occlusion, retinal haemorrhage, visual acuity 
reduced and diabetic retinal oedema.  
One case reported 1 serious adverse event of 
 patient, approximately two months 
after start of vadadustat therapy. No additional information was available for this case. 
) in a 
Overall, the frequency of the adverse event retinopathy reported in patients using 
vadadustat both in clinical trials and in post-marketing setting is low. Patients with CKD 
have a high risk of retinopathy due to a high incidence of concomitant diabetes mellitus 
and hypertension. Therefore, the risk of retinopathy is not considered to alter the overall 
benefit-risk profile of vadadustat. 
•  Hyperkalemia 
In the nonclinical development of vadadustat, hyperkalemia was noted in the 14-, 28-, 
and 91-day dog toxicology studies. Hyperkalemia resolved following the non-dosing 
period in each study (Module 2.6). 
In the pooled DD-CKD Population, hyperkalemia (MedDRA PTs: hyperkalemia, blood 
potassium abnormal, and blood potassium increased) was reported for 7.4% of subjects in 
the vadadustat treatment group and 9.9% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment 
group (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 Studies, hyperkalemia (MedDRA PTs: 
hyperkalemia, blood potassium abnormal, and blood potassium increased) was reported 
for 9.9% of subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and 11.9% of subjects in the 
darbepoetin alfa treatment group. The relative risk (95% CI), vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa 
was 0.829 (0.7274, 0.9457) (ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). There were no clinically meaningful 
increases in potassium levels from baseline observed in vadadustat compared to 
darbepoetin alfa-treated subjects. The majority of hyperkalemia events in the vadadustat 
treatment arm (76%) were NSAEs. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): 
As of 18 Aug 2021, two spontaneous case reports with 2 adverse events (one each with 
hyperkalaemia and blood potassium increased) were reported. With an estimate of 4779 
Page 52 of 87 
 
PYT of exposure this calculates to a reporting rate of 0.042 adverse events / 100 PYT. 
There was one serious case report (hyperkalaemia), and no case had a fatal outcome. 
The serious adverse event of hyperkalaemia started approximately 4 months after start of 
vadadustat therapy and resolved after 11 days with vadadustat ongoing. The underlying 
chronic kidney disease is a plausible alternative explanation of the adverse event. 
Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte imbalance associated with the underlying medical 
condition of CKD, especially in the dialysis population. Therefore, hyperkalaemia as a 
safety concern does not impact the benefit-risk profile of vadadustat. 
•  Cardiac valve disorders 
Heart valvular histopathology findings were noted in the 28- and 90-day rat studies only 
at doses/exposures which caused polycythemia. The valvular lesions were not considered 
clinically relevant because: 1) observations were rat-specific (no corollary in mouse or 
dog studies); 2) findings were identified only in the presence of polycythemia; 3) 
polycythemia, even if it develops, is reversible in patients treated with vadadustat; 4) 
heart valve lesions were also noted with EPO in nonclinical studies but has not been seen 
in patients despite being marketed globally for more than 30 years. 
In the pooled DD-CKD Population, cardiac valve disorders [MedDRA High Level Group 
Term (HLGT) cardiac valve disorders] were reported in 2.1% of vadadustat and 2.8% of 
the darbepoetin alfa treatment groups (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 Studies, cardiac valve disorders 
[MedDRA HLGT cardiac valve disorders] were reported in 2.3% of both vadadustat and 
darbepoetin alfa treatment groups (ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). Most events were NSAEs 
(87%); and mild to moderate in severity (82%). All the cardiac valve disorders events 
(NSAEs and SAEs) were assessed as not related to either drug (vadadustat and 
darbepoetin alfa) as most patients had a history of hypertension, advanced age, worsening 
of CKD, previous history of cardiac related issues-cardiomyopathy and pre-existing 
valvular disorders. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): 
As of 18 Aug 2021, no case report with a PT from the MedDRA HLGT cardiac valve 
disorders has been reported.  
Cardiac valve disorders are therefore not considered to alter the overall benefit-risk 
profile of vadadustat. 
Page 53 of 87 
•  Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
In the pooled DD-CKD Population, CHF (SMQ Cardiac failure, narrow) was reported for 
8.3% subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and 10.1% of in the darbepoetin alfa 
treatment group (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 Studies, CHF (SMQ Cardiac failure, 
narrow) was reported for 10.3% subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and 11.5% of 
in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group. The relative risk (95% CI), 
vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa: 0.897 (0.7870, 1.0217) (ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). The most 
frequent PTs were cardiac failure congestive (3.9%), pulmonary oedema (2.4%), cardiac 
failure acute (1.6%), cardiac failure (1.4%), and acute pulmonary oedema (1.0%). Most 
of the cases reported underlying CKD as etiology. There was no case with investigator 
determined causality as related to the study drug. No evidence was found to support an 
association between vadadustat and CHF. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): 
As of 18 Aug 2021, 20 spontaneous case reports with 21 adverse events under the SMQ 
Cardiac Failure (narrow) were reported. With an estimate of 4779 PYT of exposure this 
calculates to a reporting rate of 0.439 adverse events / 100 PYT. All 21 adverse events 
were serious and 12 had fatal outcome. The reported terms were: 
-  Cardiac failure  
-  Cardiac failure congestive 
-  Cardiac failure acute   
18 AEs 
2 AEs 
1 AE 
The 12 fatal cases of cardiac failure occurred mostly in old patients (all were 80 years or 
older, and 7 were above 90 years of age). In 50% of the patients a cardiac or vascular 
disease was reported as concomitant condition. Patients with CKD are more likely to 
experience a cardiovascular event and have a higher risk of heart failure and sudden 
cardiac death. As such underlying CKD especially in old patient provides for an 
alternative explanation for the above observations. 
Overall, the case reports of cardiac failure during clinical development and in the post-
marketing setting do not change the benefit-risk profile of vadadustat. 
•  Pulmonary hypertension  
In the pooled DD-CKD Population, pulmonary hypertension (MedDRA SMQ Pulmonary 
hypertension, narrow) was reported for 2.1% of subjects in the vadadustat treatment 
group and 2.6% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group. The relative risk 
(95% CI), vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa: 0.810 (0.5558, 1.1809) (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
Page 54 of 87 
 
In the pooled CKD Population for Global Phase 3 Studies, pulmonary hypertension 
(MedDRA SMQ Pulmonary hypertension, narrow) was reported for 2.4% of subjects in 
the vadadustat treatment group and 2.6% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment 
group. The relative risk (95% CI), vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa: 0.916 (0.6873, 1.2208) 
(ISS Table 14.3.1.13c).  
Equal distribution of the events among the vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa treatment 
groups were suggestive of no association between vadadustat with pulmonary 
hypertension, but rather supported the association of the pulmonary hypertension with the 
underlying CKD and comorbidities that are common characteristics of the CKD 
population. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): As of 18 Aug 2021 one spontaneous case report with 
an adverse event under the SMQ Pulmonary hypertension (narrow) was reported. This 
was a case report of an 
 patient who experienced 
. The patient had medical history 
 and received carvedilol `for heart 
protection. The event started approximately 4 months after start of vadadustat. 
Concomitant conditions of this patient provide for an alternative explanation for the 
reported adverse event. 
Overall, the case reports of pulmonary hypertension during clinical development and in 
the post-marketing setting do not change the benefit-risk profile of vadadustat. 
2.7.1.2 
SVII.1.2: Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of 
Safety Concerns in the RMP 
Important Identified risk: 
There are no important identified risks for Vadadustat. 
Important Potential Risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Risk-benefit impact: 
In pooled DD-CKD population, hepatotoxicity was reported for 6.0% of subjects in the 
vadadustat treatment group and 6.9% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group. 
Overall, 288 subjects (141 vadadustat, and 147 darbepoetin alfa) were identified having 
TEAEs (serious and non-serious), that were suggestive of hepatic dysfunction identified 
by Drug related hepatic disorders comprehensive search, broad SMQ and lab related 
findings (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
In pooled CKD population, hepatotoxicity was reported for 6.8% of subjects in the 
vadadustat treatment group and 6.5% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group. 
Page 55 of 87 
 
 
Overall, 338 subjects (164 vadadustat, 173 darbepoetin alfa, and 1 epoetin alfa-treated 
subjects) were identified having TEAEs (serious and non-serious), that were suggestive 
of hepatic dysfunction identified by Drug related hepatic disorders comprehensive search, 
broad SMQ and lab related findings (ISS Table 14.3.1.13c). 
Taking into consideration the totality of data from the clinical program, the overall 
hepatic profiles of vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa appear to be similar. 
No cases met the biochemical criteria for Hy’s Law (Hepatic Expert Report). 
Hepatotoxicity is considered as important potential risk. With routine risk minimisation 
measures and appropriate communication, the overall impact on the public health is 
considered to be low.

Risks, and Missing Information 
2.7.3.1 
SVII.3.1: Presentation of Important Identified Risks and 
Important Potential Risks 
Important Identified risk: 
There are no important identified risks for Vadadustat. 
Important Potential Risk: Hepatotoxicity 
MedDRA terms: SMQ Drug related hepatic disorders comprehensive search (narrow) 
Potential mechanisms: 
No potential mechanism has been identified from the nonclinical studies regarding the 
risk of hepatotoxicity. Moreover, vadadustat is a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-
hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) which leads to increased cellular levels of HIF. Most 
evidence points towards a tissue protective role of HIFs during acute liver injury, while in 
conditions of chronic liver disease, inhibition of HIFs may be desirable. Pharmacologic 
approaches to enhance hepatic stabilization of HIFs during liver disease can be achieved 
by pharmacologic inhibitors of PHDs.59 
Evidence sources and strength of evidence: 
The sources of evidence were from hepatic events data from clinical studies. 
Page 56 of 87 
Hepatotoxicity was reported for 6.0% of subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and 
6.9% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group, in pooled DD-CKD population 
(ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
Hepatotoxicity was reported for 6.8% of subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and 
6.5% of subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group, in pooled CKD population. (ISS 
Table 14.3.1.13c). 
Characterization of the risk: 
Frequency 
AESI of hepatotoxicity (SMQ Drug related hepatic disorders comprehensive search, 
broad) was reported for 6.0% of subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and 6.9% of 
subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group, in the pooled DD-CKD population. 
Overall, 288 subjects (141 vadadustat, and 147 darbepoetin alfa) were identified having 
TEAEs (serious and non-serious), that were suggestive of hepatic dysfunction identified 
by Drug related hepatic disorders comprehensive search, broad SMQ and lab related 
findings (ISS Table 14.3.1.12a). 
AESI of hepatotoxicity (SMQ Drug related hepatic disorders comprehensive search, 
broad) was reported in 6.8% of subjects in the vadadustat treatment group and in 6.5% of 
subjects in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group, in the pooled CKD population. (ISS 
Table 14.3.1.13c). Overall, in the clinical development programme 338 subjects (164 
vadadustat, 173 darbepoetin alfa, and 1 epoetin alfa-treated subjects) were identified to 
have TEAEs (serious and non-serious), that were suggestive of hepatic dysfunction 
identified by SMQ Drug related hepatic disorder comprehensive search (broad) and/or 
lab related findings. 
These hepatic events were adjudicated in an unblinded manner while the clinical 
development progressed and then subsequently underwent blinded hepatic expert 
assessment after the clinical development was completed, to minimize bias. 
During a Phase 2 development, one vadadustat-treated subject experienced a drug-related 
treatment-emergent SAE of abnormal hepatic parameters. Initially an external hepatic 
expert assessed this case to have met the biochemical criteria for Hy’s law based on ALT 
>3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN, although the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 
also elevated >5 × ULN. Later upon re-assessment by Hepatic Expert Committee 
(Unblinded), it was determined that this case was suggestive of mixed-type hepatobiliary 
injury with a cholestatic component and was assessed as non-classic case of Hy’s Law. 
After the Global Phase 3 clinical development for vadadustat completed, Blinded Expert 
Committee (BEC) re-adjudicated this case (Sep 2020) and did not report this as a Hy's 
Page 57 of 87 
Law case but rather determined it as a `severe hepatic injury event’ probably related to 
vadadustat. No other cases met biochemical criteria for Hy’s Law. (Hepatic Expert 
Report)51 
All the liver enzyme abnormalities resolved or were resolving at the time of last follow-
up, and no instances of acute liver failure, death attributed to vadadustat or the 
development of chronic liver disease were observed. Overall, the risk of serious 
hepatotoxicity from vadadustat is considered low and not different from that seen with 
darbepoetin alfa which is not known to cause hepatotoxicity. 
Post-marketing data (Japan only): A search by use of the SMQ Drug related hepatic 
disorders comprehensive search (narrow) with a cut-off date of 18 Aug 2021 identified 
10 spontaneous reports with potential liver injury (MedDRA PTs: hepatic function 
abnormal (6 reports), liver disorder, hepatitis, hepatic cancer recurrent, hepatic neoplasm 
(1 report each). Three reports were assessed as serious (1 report each of hepatitis, hepatic 
cancer recurrent and hepatic neoplasm.) and no case had a fatal outcome. Hepatic 
neoplasm and hepatic cancer recurrent were diagnosed approximately 1 month after start 
of vadadustat therapy, and were considered unrelated by the reporter. The 10 reports 
calculate to a reporting rate of 0.209 adverse events / 100 PYT. 
Seriousness and Reversibility: 
Hepatic parameter changes (includes transaminases increased, ALT increased, AST 
increased, hepatic enzyme increased, and liver function test abnormal) have been 
observed in global Phase 3 studies. The majority of the events were non serious, and all 
resolved or were resolving after drug discontinuation. 
Post marketing Data (Japan only): As of 18 August 2021, there has been 10 case reports 
of potential liver injury, 3 were serious. No case had a fatal outcome. 
Risk factors and risk groups:  
In general, known risk factors for hepatotoxicity include age, gender, drug interactions, 
high alcohol intake, malnutrition, HCV, HBV, HIV infections, and genetic 
predisposition. Patients with hepatic steatosis, alcohol liver disease, and other acquired or 
inherited liver diseases may be at a higher risk for developing hepatotoxicity. Patients 
Page 58 of 87 
pre- or concomitantly treated with other medications associated with hepatotoxicity may 
be at higher risk for hepatotoxicity. 
Preventability:  
As a cautionary measure, ALT, AST, and bilirubin must be evaluated prior to the 
initiation of vadadustat, monthly for 3 months after initiation and as clinically indicated 
thereafter. 
Instructions for discontinuation: Vadadustat must be discontinued if ALT or AST 
elevations > 3x ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase > 2x ULN, or if there is 
persistent ALT or AST > 3x ULN. 
The Section 4.2 and Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that Vafseo is not recommended for 
use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) as the safety and 
efficacy has not been evaluated in this population. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Taking into consideration the totality of data from the clinical programme, the overall 
hepatic profiles of vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa appear to be similar. Darbepoetin alfa 
does not have a known hepatotoxicity profile or warning provided in the label. 
Vadadustat doses are titrated from 300 mg according to the Hb response to be within the 
Hb target range. Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended based on age, sex or 
race, renal impairment or mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
Hepatotoxicity may have a significant impact on the patient requiring hospitalization or 
be life-threatening in serious cases. However, as hepatotoxicity can be minimized in 
clinical practice through monitoring of liver enzymes, it is not expected to change the 
favourable benefit-risk of vadadustat that is used to treat a for the treatment of 
symptomatic anaemia associated with CKD in adults on chronic maintenance dialysis. 
Available information regarding the risk of hepatotoxicity does not impact the overall 
positive benefit-risk ratio of vadadustat. More data will be collected regarding this risk 
through proposed routine PV activities (special clinical measures for hepatotoxicity, 
targeted follow up questionnaire for hepatotoxicity, hepatotoxicity specific Summary 
Safety Reports) beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection and any potential 
impact to the benefit-risk ratio will continue to be evaluated. 
Public health impact: 
No clear pattern of liver test abnormalities, nor time to onset of these biochemical events 
was apparent based on the entire hepatic AE and SAE dataset. All the liver enzyme 
Page 59 of 87 
abnormalities resolved or were resolving where data were available, and no instances of 
acute liver failure, death attributed to vadadustat, or the development of chronic liver 
disease were observed. The overall clinical impression, based on the totality of the 
available data, that the risk of serious hepatic injury, appears to be very low and not 
different from darbepoetin alfa. With routine risk minimisation measures and appropriate 
communication, the overall impact on the public health is considered to be low.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
6.1 
VI.1:  Summary of the Risk Management Plan for VAFSEO 
(vadadustat). 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for VAFSEO. The RMP details 
important risks of VAFSEO, how these risks can be minimised, and how more 
information will be obtained about VAFSEO's risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
VAFSEO's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how vadadustat should 
be used.  
This summary of the RMP for VAFSEO should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
VAFSEO’s RMP. 
6.1.1 
I. The Medicine and What it is Used for 
VAFSEO is authorised for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) in adults on chronic maintenance dialysis (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains vadadustat as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Pharmaceutical forms and strengths are as follows. 
VAFSEO (vadadustat) is approved as a film-coated, immediate-release tablet in 150 mg, 
300 mg, and 450 mg dosage strengths. 
Further information about the evaluation of VAFSEO’s benefits can be found in 
VAFSEO’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage. <link to the EPAR summary landing page>. 
6.1.2 
II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise 
or Further Characterize the Risks  
Important risks of VAFSEO, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about VAFSEO's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
Page 65 of 87 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The authorised pack size  the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly 
•  The medicine’s legal status  the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of VAFSEO is not yet available, it is 
listed under `missing information’ below. 
6.1.2.1 
II.A: List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of VAFSEO are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of VAFSEO. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of 
the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
The sources of evidence were from non-clinical 
studies, and hepatic events data from clinical studies. 
In general, known risk factors for hepatotoxicity 
include age, gender, drug interactions, high alcohol 
intake, malnutrition, HCV, HBV, HIV infections, and 
genetic predisposition. Patients with hepatic steatosis, 
alcohol liver disease, and other acquired or inherited 
liver diseases may be at a higher risk for developing 
hepatotoxicity. Patients pre- or concomitantly treated 
with other medications associated with hepatotoxicity 
may be at higher risk for hepatotoxicity.

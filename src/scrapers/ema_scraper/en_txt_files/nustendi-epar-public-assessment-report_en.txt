1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant FGK Representative Service GmbH submitted on 12 February 2019 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Nustendi, through the centralised 
procedure under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 December 2017. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Nustendi is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-
familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum 
tolerated dose of a statin alone, 
• 
in combination with a statin in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum 
tolerated dose of a statin in addition to bempedoic acid or ezetimibe, 
• 
• 
alone in patients who are either statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated, 
alone in patients who are either statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated, and 
are unable to reach LDL-C goals with bempedoic acid alone or ezetimibe alone. 
• 
in patients already being treated with the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe as 
separate tablets with or without statin. 
Ezetimibe 10 mg has been shown to reduce the frequency of cardiovascular events. The effect of 
bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
EMEA-002200-PIP01-17 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver for the paediatric population 
from birth to less than 18 years of age.

Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance bempedoic acid contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 26 May 2016 
(EMEA/H/SA/3294/1/2016/SME/II) and 31 May 2018 (EMEA/H/SA/3294/1/FU/1/2018/SME/II) for the 
development programme supporting the indication granted by the CHMP. The Scientific Advices 
pertained to the following clinical aspects: 
•  Definition of statin intolerance and the approach to identify a statin intolerant (SI) population. 
•  Agreement on the design of the phase 3 studies 1002-044 and 1002-046. 
• 
• 
The size of the overall safety database, duration of exposure, and plan to evaluate potential 
signals for CV risk. 
The proposed cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT study 1002-043) in SI patients to support 
the indication for CV risk reduction, including the design, acceptability of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary endpoint, plan for adjudication of clinical endpoints, the 
proposed 4-week placebo run-in period, background therapy during the CVOT, safety 
monitoring/risk management plan, long-term exposure in the CVOT, strategy to enroll 
patients in a 1:1 randomisation of bempedoic acid compared to placebo, sample size/effect 
size/power calculations, analysis for time-to-event endpoints, definition and proposed 
statistical analysis of secondary endpoints, and interim analysis. 
• 
The revision to the inclusion criteria for study 1002-043 to expand the eligibility criteria to 
include patients who are unwilling to attempt a second statin or low dose statin, and whether, 
with the expanded eligibility criteria, the CVOT will continue to provide the clinical data 
necessary to support the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary hypercholesterolemia by definition is any hypercholesterolemia which is caused by a 
disorder (either familial- or nonfamilial) in lipid metabolism and is not caused by another condition, 
such as hypothyroidism, or a drug effect. The heterozygous familial form of this condition (HeFH) is 
more rare and is estimated to occur between 1:200 and 1:500 individuals globally. LDL-C levels in 
affected individuals are elevated, and in spite of aggressive statin use, there is still a 2-fold excess of 
CHD-related deaths relative to age-matched controls within this population. 
Hyperlipidemia is the heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an excess of lipids (ie, 
cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides) in the bloodstream. Hypercholesterolemia, specifically refers 
to the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Primary hyperlipidemia is usually due to 
genetic causes (monogenetic or polygenetic) and environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle. 
Primary nonfamilial hyperlipidemia is hyperlipidemia that is not due to a specific genetic disorder, 
although there are polygenetic influences. Mixed dyslipidemia is generally defined as elevated LDL-C 
and high triglycerides and/or low HDL-C. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Cardiovascular disease and high cholesterol 
CVD remains the leading cause of death among Americans, Europeans, and other populations around 
the world (World Health Organization [WHO], 2015).  Currently, over 93 million adults in the US have 
some form of CVD (Centers for Disease Control, 2018), which is responsible for one in every 4 deaths 
in the US (Centers for Disease Control, 2015). Across the European region, CVD causes more than half 
of all deaths (WHO, 2018). CVD is a tremendous economic burden to society in both the US and Europe 
In Europe, CVD costs are €210 billion per year with approximately 53% due to health care costs, 26% 
associated with productivity losses, and 21% related to non-hospital related care (European Heart 
Network, 2017). 
The approval of the FCMP for use as an add-on treatment to other LMTs, including maximally tolerated 
statins, and/or in patients who are statin intolerant would be consistent with global treatment 
guidelines for patients with hyperlipidemia who require additional LDL-C lowering. 
CVD risk factors are well established and include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, smoking, 
diabetes, physical inactivity, obesity, and increasing age; the first 3 are the key risk factors.  Lowering 
cholesterol has been proven to reduce the risk of CVD.  In the most recent report by the WHO, the 
global prevalence of elevated TC in adults (≥ 5.0 mmol/l or 193 mg/dL) was 39%; the prevalence is 
higher in both Europe (54%) and the Americas (48%) (WHO, 2018). Hypercholesterolemia that is a 
result of the genetic disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), increases the risk of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) both in untreated and treated patients (Slack, 1969; Scientific 
Steering Committee, 1991; Kjaerggard et al, 2017). 
Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study indicated that 29% of global ischemic heart 
disease burden is attributable to high TC, the second leading risk factor after high blood pressure, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 11/239 
 
 
 
which was responsible for 53% of global ischemic heart disease (Lim et al, 2012).  During 2005–2012, 
an estimated 37% of US adults met 2013 AHA/American College of Cardiology (ACC) criteria for 
needing cholesterol lowering medication or were receiving cholesterol-lowering medication (Mercado et 
al, 2015).  A meta-analysis of over 30 studies evaluating diet, drugs, or surgery to lower LDL-C has 
shown that for every 1 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C, total mortality is reduced by 1% (2.1.3.  
CVD related mortality in both the US and Europe has been decreasing (Benjamin et al, 2017; Wilkins 
et al, 2017).  Improvements in overall cardiovascular health are projected to reduce CHD deaths by 
30% between 2010 and 2020; although by 2030, there will still be 43.9% of the US population 
projected to have some form of CVD.  Several studies have attributed the declining heart disease 
mortality rates to improved risk factor control (44% to 58% of the decline) and medical and surgical 
therapies (23% to 47% of the decline) (Ford et al, 2007; Laatikainen et al, 2005; Unal et al, 2004).  
Cholesterol reduction was the leading contributor to the decline in CVD mortality in 2 of these studies 
(Laatikainen et al, 2005; Ford et al, 2007) and the second leading contributor in the third study (Unal 
et al, 2004).  An analysis estimated that of the 316,100 fewer deaths attributable to all risk factor 
declines (cholesterol, smoking, blood pressure), 79% were attributed to risk factor declines in 
asymptomatic individuals (primary prevention) and 21% were in patients with CHD (secondary 
prevention).  Cholesterol reduction accounted for the most significant proportion of CHD deaths 
prevented in primary prevention patients (Young et al, 2010).  These data emphasize the importance 
of targeting cholesterol reduction for both primary and secondary prevention of reducing CV events.  
This is supported by current US and EU recommendations that recognize LDL-C goals are not always 
achievable with statin therapy alone and thus there remains an unmet medical need to provide 
additional LDL-C lowering therapies for patients with elevated LDL-C who are receiving maximally 
tolerated statin therapy (which may mean no statin at all) (Grundy et al, 2018; Catapano et al, 2016).  
Collectively, these data suggest that if the prevalence of elevated LDL-C was more widely reduced, this 
would lead to even greater declines in ASCVD-associated morbidity and mortality. 
Add-On Therapy 
A recent review of guidelines and clinical trials evaluating non-statin agents (Russell et al, 2018) 
confirms the growing base of evidence and expert opinion supporting the use of combination lipid-
lowering therapies and the need for additional therapies.  While the recommended first-line treatment 
is a statin monotherapy, combination therapies represent an opportunity for an individualized, patient-
centered approach to LDL-C lowering and ASCVD risk reduction in patients intolerant of statins and/or 
unable to reach individualized serum LDL-C levels.   
The 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines on 
the treatment of cholesterol focus on the benefits of statin therapy, but in certain circumstances, 
recommend non-statin therapies, specifically bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors 
(Catapano et al, 2016).  For patients at very high CV risk, the ESC/EAS recommends an LDL-C treatment 
target of < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or a reduction in LDL-C of 50% from baseline.  Also, several US 
healthcare organizations including the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of 
Cardiology (ACC) recently announced 2018 guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol 
(hereafter referred to as AHA/ACC guidelines). These guidelines focus on the benefits of statin therapy 
but recommend considering adding non-statin therapies (ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and PCSK9 
inhibitors) to maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with multiple ASCVD events or at least 1 
ASCVD event plus additional risk factors if LDL-C is ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L).  In patients with 
primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL) who have LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL with statin therapy, 
non-statin therapies may be needed (Grundy et al, 2018). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 12/239 
 
 
 
Additionally, the ACC expert consensus documents provide decision pathways for selection of add-on 
non-statin therapies if the patients in the 4 statin benefit groups experience unacceptable adverse 
effects or insufficient LDL-C lowering when taking the recommended intensity of statin (Lloyd-Jones 
et al, 2016; Lloyd-Jones et al, 2017). In each of these 4 patient management groups, ezetimibe was 
recommended as second-line treatment options for patients who required additional LDL-C lowering 
beyond their statin. 
Current therapeutic guidelines identify the following 4 patient management groups for whom the 
evidence for ASCVD risk reduction with LDL-C lowering clearly outweighs the risk of adverse events 
from statin therapy: 
•  Adults with clinical ASCVD 
•  Adults with severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-Cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]) 
•  Adults with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C 70 mg/dL to 189 mg/dL (1.8-4.9 mmol/L) 
•  Primary prevention for adults with elevated risk for ASCVD 
Patients requiring additional LDL-C lowering and patients eligible for non-statin LDL-C lowering 
therapies would benefit from FCMP therapy. 
Statin Intolerance 
In the UK, the National Institute of Care and Clinical Excellence (NICE) released a new guideline in 
February 2016 entitled Ezetimibe for Treating Primary Heterozygous-Familial and Non-Familial 
Hypercholesterolaemia (NICE, 2016). This guideline sought to provide formalized guidance on the use 
of ezetimibe in light of the evidence from the IMPROVE-IT trial. Ezetimibe monotherapy was 
recommended as an option for treating primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia [HeFH] and nonfamilial) in patients in whom statin therapy was contraindicated, 
or in patients who were unable to tolerate statin therapy.  The ESC produced, in conjunction with other 
societies on CVD prevention, updated guidelines on CVD prevention in June 2016.  These guidelines 
suggest the use of ezetimibe monotherapy when patients are intolerant of statins (Piepoli et al, 2016).  
Therefore, current major clinical applications center on the use of ezetimibe monotherapy in patients 
intolerant of statins or in whom they are contraindicated (Serban et al, 2016). 
As many as 10% of patients are unable to tolerate statins at any dose due to dose-limiting toxicities 
and adverse effects that result in intolerance and/or contraindications (Thompson et al, 2016; 
Jacobson et al, 2014), and as many as 15-20% of all patients on statins may experience statin-
associated adverse events that may limit the dosage needed to reach LDL-C goals (Banach et al, 
2015).  In the EU statin intolerance language is included in label indications for LDL-C lowering drugs 
(Repatha SmPC, 2018; Praluent SmPC, 2015).   
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
LDL-C as a surrogate for CVD 
Bempedoic acid is seeking marketing approval for an LDL-C lowering indication. Lowering LDL-C has 
been accepted as a surrogate endpoint for the reduction of CV events by clinicians and regulatory 
authorities for many years (Cannon al, 2002; Jacobson et al, 2014; Ference et al, 2017a).  To date, all 
cholesterol lipid-lowering drug approvals in the US and EU have been initially based on LDL-C lowering

without confirmed CV outcomes benefits. Initial approvals of PCSK9 inhibitors, based on an LDL-C 
lowering mechanism through the LDL receptor and validation by human genetics, are the most recent 
evidence of the continued acceptance of LDL-C lowering as a validated surrogate (Repatha 
[evolocumab] US Prescribing Information, 2017; Repatha SmPC 2018; Silverman et al, 2016; Ference 
et al, 2016).   
In 2017, the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) released a consensus statement to confirm the 
“LDL-C hypothesis” by stating that “there is a dose-dependent, log-linear association between absolute 
LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, and this association is independent of other cardiovascular risk 
factors and is consistent across the multiple lines of evidence" (Ference et al, 2017a). Guidelines for 
LDL-C generally consider LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) as optimal for adults (Jellinger, et al, 
2017; Grundy et al, 2018). In specific risk populations, the threshold of initiating or intensifying 
treatment is at LDL-C levels > 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) (Jellinger et al, 2017; Catapano et al, 2016; 
Stone et al, 2014; Grundy et al, 2018). Across the bempedoic acid Phase 3 clinical program, mean % 
change in LDL-C was the primary efficacy endpoint. All Phase 3 study eligibility criteria included 
patients having hyperlipidemia with at least LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) on stable background 
lipid-modifying therapy (LMT). 
Evidence for the direct correlation between LDL-C and CVD comes from 4 different categories of 
studies: preclinical, epidemiological, genetics, and interventional (Feig, 2014; Williams et al, 2008; 
Zadelaar et al, 2007) (Taylor et al, 2002; Taylor et al, 2004; Tardif et al, 2006; Stamler et al, 1986; 
Kannel et al, 1971) (Chen et al, 1991).   
FH is a genetic condition that strongly supports the unique role of elevated LDL-C in the risk of major 
CV events. Patients with single gene (typically in the LDL receptor) mutations (heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) have untreated LDL-C levels usually in the range of 200 to 500 mg/dL.  
HeFH increases the risk of ASCVD both in untreated and treated patients (Slack, 1969; Scientific 
Steering Committee, 1991; Kjaerggard et al, 2017). Given the younger age of this at-risk population, 
patients with FH typically do not have an accumulation of the other traditional risk factors associated 
with CVD, such as hypertension, cigarette smoking, or diabetes typically seen in the general 
population, demonstrating the singular role that elevated LDL-C can have in the progression of 
atherosclerosis and the development of premature major CV events.   
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Over 30 CVOTs in several LDL-C lowering drug therapies (including statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 
inhibitors) have validated LDL-C as a surrogate endpoint of CV events (Baigent et al, 2010; Cannon et 
al, 2015; Sabatine et al, 2017; Silverman et al, 2016; Schwartz et al, 2018).  A patient-level meta-
analysis of statins including 26 large CVOTs and involving 170,000 participants showed a consistent 
relationship between LDL-C reduction and CV outcomes. This meta-analysis demonstrated that a 
38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) lowering of LDL-C was associated with a 22% reduction in the 5-year incidence 
of MACE, coronary revascularizations, and ischemic strokes (Baigent et al, 2010). This large meta-
analysis has also demonstrated a consistency of the relationship between LDL-C lowering and reduction 
in CV event risk across a wide variety of patient populations including patients with primary and 
secondary prevention, patients with diabetes, patients with hypertension, and across a wide range of 
baseline LDL-C levels. Similar CV risk reductions have been reported for PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab 
and alirocumab (Sabatine et al, 2017; Schwartz et al, 2018). There is no evidence for a threshold 
below which LDL-C lowering is not beneficial. Most recent CVOTs have achieved LDL-C levels of 35 to 
40 mg/dL, and recent trials have identified no apparent risk to achieving levels of LDL-C < 25 mg/dL 
(Boekholdt et al, 2014; Robinson et al, 2017). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 14/239 
 
 
 
Results from some earlier CVOTs that have tested drug candidates in the cholesteryl ester transfer 
protein (CETP)-inhibitor class have suggested a potential lack of relationship between changes in LDL-C 
with this class of drug and lack of CV benefit. However, the most recent trial to complete in this class, 
REVEAL with anacetrapib, indicated a CV benefit that aligns with the absolute reduction in LDL-C that 
was observed.  In the REVEAL study, there was an 11 mg/dL difference in LDL-C that translated to a 
CV event hazard ratio of 0.91 (p < 0.004) (Bowman et al, 2017). These results further support the 
relationship between absolute reduction in LDL-C and reductions in major CV events as observed with 
statins. The 3 previous trials testing CETP-inhibitors likely suffered from extraneous issues that 
impeded or inhibited the ability to demonstrate this LDL-C/CV event relationship ranging from off-
target toxicity (torcetrapib; ILLUMINATE), lack of LDL-C efficacy (dalcetrapib; dal-OUTCOMES), and a 
short patient follow-up period combined with a low baseline LDL-C (evacetrapib; ACCELERATE). When 
looking at the CETP-inhibitor data as a whole and understanding the basis for the results in these 
trials, the science still provides an overall supportive relationship to LDL-C and CV events. 
A consistent role for lowering LDL-C to reduce the risk of major CV events has been established.  
Together, this evidence shows that lowering LDL-C with bempedoic acid meets the criteria as a valid 
surrogate endpoint for reducing CVD risk. 
Data to support the relationship between LDL-C and CV events and specifically the relationship with 
inhibition of ACL has been shown in genetic studies of variations in the genes that influence LDL-C 
(Mendelian randomization studies) and from studies in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia 
(FH), a genetic form of hyperlipidemia. In Mendelian randomization studies evaluating multiple genetic 
targets that impact LDL-C levels, variants in genes that regulate LDL-C levels (eg, HMG CoA reductase, 
LDL-R, PCSK9) have demonstrated lowering of LDL-C is associated with a lower risk for CV events 
(Kathiresan et al, 2008; Ference et al, 2016). Several publications and reports summarize the findings 
from a portfolio of Mendelian randomization studies aimed to approximate the effect of ACL inhibition 
by bempedoic acid alone and in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies.  Similar to findings 
mediated by polymorphisms in HMG CoA reductase, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and PCSK9, 
reductions in LDL-C mediated by polymorphisms in ACL were causally associated with a similar relative 
risk reduction in major vascular events per unit change in LDL-C. Furthermore, lower LDL-C and the 
associated CV risk mediated by polymorphisms in ACL were additive when combined with 
polymorphisms in HMG CoA reductase and NPC1L1. These findings suggest that treatment with any 
combination of an ACL inhibitor, statins, ezetimibe, or a PCSK9 inhibitor should have therapeutically 
equivalent effects on the risk of CV events per unit reduction in LDL-C in all adult patients with 
hyperlipidemia (Ference et al, 2017b). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Available lipid lowering therapies include: 
•  Statins (oral tablets), as a cornerstone therapy, for which CV benefits have extensively been 
proven across a wide range of patients with different CV risk profiles. 
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/EAS guidelines on the treatment of cholesterol focus on 
the benefits of statin therapy. Non-statin therapies, specifically ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors 
(Catapano et al, 2016) could provide additional benefit or be used as alternative when patients are 
intolerant to statins or contra-indications to statins exist. 
• 
Ezetimibe (oral tablets), can be used as additional therapy when treatment goals have not been 
achieved with statins or when statins are not tolerated or contraindicated. Cardiovascular benefits 
have been demonstrated in patients with ACS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 15/239 
 
 
 
• 
PCSK9 inhibitors (injectable biologics), can be used as additional therapy when treatment goals 
have not been achieved with statins or when statins are not tolerated or contraindicated. 
Cardiovascular benefits have been demonstrated in patients with established cardiovascular 
disease. 
Despite the positive safety and high potency of the PCSK9 inhibitor class, these products are 
biologic injectable products with proven access issues (pricing and reimbursement) despite having 
broad labelling, including CV risk reduction, and are still not widely used even with a first line 
monotherapy indication for both CV risk reduction and LDL-C lowering (Baum et al, 2017; Cohen et 
al, 2017; Navar et al, 2017; Whayne, 2018).   
• 
Fibrates (oral tablets), omega-3 fatty acids (oral capsules), and bile acid sequestrants (oral 
tablets).  Cardiovascular benefits have not been demonstrated.   
Bile acid sequestrants and fibrates are generally less efficacious than statins at LDL-C lowering, 
have recently demonstrated more neutral CV outcomes, and each have their own side effect profile 
that may limit their use, as is reflected in prescribing data (National Health Service, 2006).  
Fibrates have been relegated to a minimal role in recent medical guidelines (Grundy et al, 2018; 
Catapano et al, 2016). For omega-3 fatty acids (oral capsules), cardiovascular benefits have not 
(anymore) been accepted based on recent CHMP decision. 
Results of a simulation model using data from a large US claims database showed that 31% of patients 
with ASCVD were unable to achieve an LDL-C of < 70 mg/dL with maximized statin therapy.  This only 
dropped to 14% when ezetimibe was added to the maximized statin therapy in this model (Cannon et 
al, 2017). It is important to note that this model assumed maximal levels of patient compliance and 
adherence with the statin and ezetimibe and therefore represents the “best case scenario” for the 
treatment effect of these therapies.  Any issues of partial or total intolerance of these therapies would 
create a treatment gap greater than 14%. The percentage of patients inadequately treated with statin 
therapy alone is even higher with real world use.  A study of the US National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey 2011-2012 estimated that 70.7% of overall statin-eligible patients were on a 
statin and not at LDL-C goals; this included 79.7% of patients with ASCVD, 98% of patients with an 
LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL, 42.3% of patients with diabetes and an LDL-C of 70 to 189 mg/dL, and 46.8% of 
patients with an estimated CV risk ≥ 7.5% and an LDL-C of 70 to 189 mg/dL (Wong et al, 2016). 
As many as 10% of patients are unable to tolerate statins at any dose due to dose-limiting toxicities 
and adverse effects that result in intolerance and/or contraindications (Thompson et al, 2016; 
Jacobson et al, 2014), and as many as 15% to 20% of all patients on statins may experience statin-
associated adverse events that may limit the dosage needed to reach LDL-C goals (Banach et al, 
2015).  All regions/countries recognize the importance of statin intolerance; however, 
regions/countries vary in their perspectives on defining “statin intolerance” and on prescription drug 
labelling using this terminology. For example, in the EU statin intolerance language is included in label 
indications for LDL-C lowering drugs (Repatha SmPC, 2018). 
About the product 
Bempedoic acid and ezetimibe lower LDL-C by distinct, but complementary mechanisms of action 
described below and in Figure 1. 
Bempedoic Acid Mechanism of Action 
Bempedoic acid is an ACL inhibitor that lowers LDL-C by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver.  
ACL is an enzyme upstream of HMG-CoA reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.  
Bempedoic acid requires coenzyme A (CoA) activation by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 16/239 
 
 
 
(ACSVL1) to ETC-1002-CoA (Pinkosky et al, 2016). Inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in 
decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver and lowers LDL-C in blood via upregulation of low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. ETC-1002-CoA (via ACL inhibition) and statins (via HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibition) both inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver; however, bempedoic acid is inactive in skeletal 
muscle.  Additionally, inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in concomitant suppression of hepatic 
fatty acid biosynthesis. 
Ezetimibe Mechanism of Action 
The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 
1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. Ezetimibe 
localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to 
a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic 
cholesterol stores and an increase in LDL receptors, resulting in clearance of cholesterol from the 
blood. This distinct mechanism is complementary to that of bempedoic acid.  Ezetimibe undergoes 
enterohepatic recirculation with minimal systemic exposure, where it again can inhibit the NPC1L1 
protein (Ezetrol SmPC, 2018; Zetia USPI, 2013; Nutescu et al, 2003; Toth et al, 2005; and Toth, 
2010). 
Figure 1: 
Mechanism of Action of Bempedoic Acid + Ezetimibe 
Schematic overview of the mechanism of action of bempedoic acid (ETC-1002) and ezetimibe. (1) Bempedoic acid is converted to 
ETC-1002-Coenzyme A (ETC-1002-CoA) in the liver and (2) inhibits ATP citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway.  Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis (3) 
reduces intracellular cholesterol levels, which (4) triggers the upregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity in the 
liver resulting in (5) increased clearance of LDL particles and reduced LDL-C in the blood.   
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The Applicant  received  European national scientific advice regarding bempedoic acid development in 
June 2015 with the following National Agencies: 
•  Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (Reference 943/ETC-1002-
bempedoic acid)

•  Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) (Reference JV/1570716) 
•  Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM) (Reference 62-3320 1497 26/15) 
A Scientific Advice meeting with the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) was held in May 2016.  In 
a follow-up European Medicines Agency (EMA) Scientific Advice in March 2018 expanded eligibility 
criteria for statin intolerance were agreed with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP). 
A Scientific Advice meeting with the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) was held in May 2016. 
This included discussion on the statin intolerance in which SAWP concluded that this should be defined 
as follows: patients not tolerating at least 2 different statins at the lowest approved daily dose, or to 
patients not tolerating at least 1 statin because of a severe safety effect that can be specifically 
attributed to statin use which precludes administration of a second statin. Patients tolerating statin 
doses below the approved dose range may be included. The proposed database size was supported. 
Other questions related to the outcome trial. 
In a clarification letter (24 June 2016), the SAWP accepted the definition of statin intolerance as: the 
inability to tolerate at least 2 statins, one statin at the lowest daily dose (defined as rosuvastatin 5 mg, 
atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg, or 
pitavastatin 2 mg), AND another statin at any dose, due to skeletal muscle-related symptoms, other 
than those due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, weakness, or cramping, that began or 
increased during statin therapy and stopped when statin therapy was discontinued.

2.2.2.  Active substances 
Bempedoic acid 
General information 
The chemical name of bempedoic acid is 8-hydroxy-2,2,14,14-tetramethylpentadecanedioic acid 
corresponding to the molecular formula C19H36O5. It has a relative molecular mass of 344.49 g/mol and 
the following structure: 
Figure 2: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of bempedoic acid was elucidated by a combination of 1H- and 13C- NMR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS-MS), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and UV 
spectroscopy.  The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by X-ray powder 
diffraction (XRPD), and single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). 
Bempedoic acid is a white to off-white, crystalline powder. There are no chiral centres in the molecule. 
Only one crystalline form of bempedoic acid has been identified. This form has been the only form used 
in all toxicology and clinical studies. The solubility of bempedoic acid is pH-dependent, with solubility 
increasing with increasing pH over the normal physiological pH range. It is insoluble at low pH values, 
and solubility increases rapidly above pH 6. Based on its low solubility and high permeability, 
bempedoic acid is a BCS Class II compound.  
Based on the review of the data provided by the applicant, it has been adequately substantiated that 
the active substance bempedoic acid contained in the medicinal product Nilemdo is considered to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Bempedoic acid is synthesized using 3 well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
During the assessment some questions were devoted to the setting of the impurity specifications for 
the three starting materials. The overall control strategy for impurities from the starting materials is 
now adequate. The same is true for the control strategy for the GMP process, adequate understanding 
of the formation, fate and control of actual and theoretical impurities was demonstrated. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on the chemistry of active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Of 
the organic impurities, some have been detected in drug substance batches and are controlled in the 
drug substance in accordance with ICH Q3A (R2) “Impurities in New Drug Substances” (2006). 
Potential degradation products arising from the synthesis have been identified. However, they have not 
been detected in the batches manufactured. In addition, no degradation of the bempedoic acid drug 
substance has been observed in stability testing performed to date. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 19/239 
 
 
 
 
 
In accordance with ICH M7, the compounds structure-based alert were evaluated for potential 
genotoxicity. These are controlled at 0.15% as per ICH Q3A(R2) as they were found not to be 
mutagenic following Ames testing. The active substance is tested for elemental impurities, lithium 
content and residue on ignition, at release to detect and quantify inorganic impurities. The results from 
all the batches manufactured to date are below the limits of quantitation / detection. 
The synthesis strategy for the bempedoic acid manufacturing process has remained unchanged 
throughout development and for commercialisation. The process has been optimized for efficiency and 
process controls have been amended. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified.  
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in polyethylene (PE) liners that are crimped closed and capped with a 
crimping system. The outer container (e.g., a PE or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum with a 
secure fitting lid or equivalent) is used as packaging to prevent damage to the primary container. The 
polyethylene liners comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment and design of experiment (DOE) studies.  
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed NORs and PARs. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (FT-IR, HPLC-UV), assay 
(HPLC-UV), impurities (HPLC-CAD), acid acetic (IC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), 
elemental impurities (ICP), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur. 2.9.31 ), 
microbial content (Ph. Eur.2.6.12) and E. Coli (Ph. Eur. 2.6.13). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Forced degradation studies are described in S.7.1. HPLC CAD and HPLC UV analytical methods were 
used to evaluate the degradation products of the active substance following exposure to stressed 
conditions. Both methods are considered stability indicating. Organic impurities have been studied, and 
most of them are purged from the process. Identified and unidentified impurities are limited by the DS 
specification in line with ICH Q3A. 
No relevant degradation products from bempedoic acid have been detected. Potential genotoxic 
impurities have been adequately discussed. The specification requirements for elemental impurities, 
lithium, residue on ignition, and particle size have been sufficiently justified in S.4.5. (The PDE for 
lithium is 550 µg/day, so the proposed 500 ppm limit for lithium is suitable.) The arguments as 
provided for reduced testing (one batch per year) on microbial limit testing are acceptable. 
Analysis data from 12 commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 20/239 
 
 
 
guidelines were provided. Additionally, supporting stability data from 10 batches, manufactured at 
different previous facilities ranging from pilot to commercial scale, for up to 60 months were provided. 
These batches were representative of the commercial process.  The following parameters were tested: 
appearance, assay, impurities, water content, and microbial examination. No significant changes were 
observed in the bempedoic acid primary stability samples stored after 18 months of long-term and 6 
months of accelerated storage conditions. In addition, no significant changes were observed in the 
supporting active substance batches after 60 months. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Bempedoic acid 
samples were exposed to oxidative, basic, acidic, thermal, and light stress conditions. The active 
substance is stable under basic aqueous conditions and is photostable, but degrades under the other 
conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months at controlled 
room temperature of 20°C to 25°C in the proposed container. 
Ezetimbe 
General information 
The chemical name of ezetimbe is (3R,4S)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[(3S)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-
hydroxypropyl]-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)azetidin-2-one corresponding to the molecular formula 
C24H21F2NO3. It has a relative molecular mass of 409.43 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 3: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of ezetimbe was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, 
UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The solid-state 
properties of the active substance were measured by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC). 
Ezetimibe is a white to off-white crystalline powder.  It is practically insoluble in water, and freely 
soluble in organic solvents like ethanol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol and acetone. It contains a chiral 
centre and exhibits optical isomerism. The other potential isomer (R-isomer) is in the release 
specifications. Ezetimibe exhibits polymorphism as per the available literature. However, based on the 
XRD spectra, it is found that crystalline Form–X is routinely produced by the ezetimibe proposed 
commercial manufacturer.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
Ezetimibe is synthesized using two commercially available well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation 
of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised.  
The active substance is packaged in polyethylene a bag which complies with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The primary pack is then placed into a black polyethylene 
bag with silica gel bag and tied.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, solubility, identity (IR, XRD, HPLC), 
water content (KF), specific optical rotation (polarimeter), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), chiral purity (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), particle size (dynamic light 
scattering), bulk density, tapped bulk density and specific microorganisms. 
Microbial tests on specified micro-organisms are included, but not the usual TAMC and TYMC. The 
applicant was asked either to demonstrate that a specification on microbial purity is not needed (Note 
for Guidance Specifications – Q6A (CHMP/ICH/ 367/96), Decision Tree #6), or to apply a usual routine 
specification (TAMC, TYMC, E. coli). Finally, the applicant introduced Ph. Eur. requirements (methods 
2.6.12 and 2.6.13) for routine release. 
The absence of genotoxic impurities is sufficiently discussed. A risk assessment on elemental impurities 
was performed as per ICH Q3D guidelines. No class 1 or 2A elemental impurities were detected in 
tested batches and it can be concluded that no tests are needed in the active substance specification. 
All analytical methods have been adequately described. Quantitative methods are considered 
adequately validated. Compliance with the pre-defined acceptance criteria of ICH Q2 R1 has been 
shown. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to number 60 months under long term conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. Supporting data from 9 more commercial scale batches under long 
term and accelerated conditions was also provided.  The following parameters were tested: description, 
identity, water content, impurities, assay, chiral purity and particle size.  
All tested parameters were within the specifications. The accelerated data did not reveal any significant 
change during the study period of 6 months. The long-term study of 60 months did not show any 
significant change in the impurity profile and other characteristics studied. No clear up- or downward

trends are observed, under accelerated or long term conditions, for all batches up to the maximum 
period tested.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Ezetimibe is not 
photosensitive. 
Results from forced degradation studies under stress conditions (heat, acid and basic hydrolysis, 
aqueous and oxidation) were also provided on one batch. Degradation is observed under aqueous 
conditions (heated, acid, base) but no significant degradation was observed under oxidative conditions 
or when the sample was exposed to heat in the solid state. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months stored in the 
proposed container under nitrogen in order to protect from moisture. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as blue oval film-coated tablets containing 180 mg of bempedoic acid 
and 10 mg of ezetimibe. The tablets are debossed with ‘818’ on one side and ‘ESP’ on the other side. 
The tablet dimensions are 15.00 mm x 7.00 mm x 5.00 (±0.30) mm. 
The pharmaceutical development has been well described in the dossier. Pharmaceutical development 
of the finished product contains QbD elements. The development of the FDC tablets is based on QTTP 
of the tablets, and iterative risk assessments for the two drug substances and their potential impact on 
the critical quality attributes (CQAs)., as well as iterative risk assessments of formulation variables on 
CQAs of the drug product. CQAs were defined as appearance, assay, content uniformity, degradation, 
stability, disintegration, dissolution of both APIs, hardness, friability, water content and microbiology. 
Iterative risk assessments were conducted to identify the potential impact of formulation variables on 
the CQAs and used to guide development activities.  
The FDC formulation development was adequately described including FDC development focused on 
optimizing the ezetimibe granulation, choice between mono- or bilayer tablet formulations, and 
biostudies on the monolayer and bilayer tablets in a clinical study as a formulation-screening tool. The 
two active substances have different physicochemical properties which requires them to be granulated 
separately. The two granulation processes were optimised separately and then combined into a single 
tablet separately in a bilayer, or pre-mixed in a monolayer. Both tablets had acceptable properties in 
vitro so a clinical study was conducted to assess relative bioavailability which led to the selection of the 
monolayer tablet for further development and subsequent commercialisation. The FDC tablet was 
bridged to the individually administered single API tablets (Zetia and bempedoic acid) in a randomised 
controlled pivotal study in accordance with the EMA’s FDC Guideline. 
The applicant described the manufacturing process development for bempedoic acid and ezetimibe 
granulations in detail, based on QTTP, risk assessments of drug substance and formulation attributes, 
and earlier drug product experiences. 
In the final risk assessment all identified initial high and medium risks were downgraded by mitigating 
the risks based on the formulation optimisation studies and setting of proven acceptable ranges.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.

The dissolution method development has been adequately described in full detail. The discriminatory 
power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/PCTFE/aluminum  blisters.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  3  main  steps.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard 
manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing steps are adequately described. Critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process 
controls (IPCs) have been clearly indicated in the process descriptions. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  test  for  appearance,  dimensions,  identity  (HPLC), 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC) dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content 
(KF), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product specifications are considered to be adequate.  
The applicant has provided a satisfactory risk assessment report on elemental impurities in accordance 
with guideline ICH Q3D. Based on the presented risk assessment and available results, it can be 
concluded that there is no need to specify any elemental impurities in the final product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for 3 batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Additional data from 
supporting batches were also provided. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 15 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Additional data from 2 supportive stability 
batches were also provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for assay (both actives), bempedoic acid and ezetimibe related impurities, 
dissolution (both actives), uniformity of dosage units (both actives), water content, and microbial 
purity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. All test results remain within the 
acceptance limits and no changes were observed. No significant changes in appearance, assay, 
degradation products, dissolution, water content, or microbial limits were observed in the FDC tablet 
primary stability samples at long-term and at accelerated storage conditions.  
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. Nustendi is not photosensitive. 
Additionally, one finished product batch was exposed to oxidative, basic, acidic, and thermal stress. 
Significant degradation occurs under basic and acidic aqueous conditions but not under oxidative 
conditions or heat stress.

Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
Magnesium Stearate used does not contain, nor is manufactured with any raw material containing 
bovine or other animal related products. These Stearates are derived from edible vegetable sources. 
The fatty acid used in production are derived from palm and produced from the fruit of Elaeis 
guineensis. 
Post approval change management protocol 
A post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) has been proposed to facilitate the addition of 
alternate suppliers for the designated regulatory starting materials (RSMs) used in the manufacture of 
bempedoic acid drug substance.  This protocol is acceptable and therefore, new manufacturers can be 
introduced by Type 1AIN variation provided that the steps and conditions in the protocol are met. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing processes. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress 
and to investigate the risk of presence of nitrosamine in their medicinal products, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
It is recommended that an updated risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in (name active substance + finished product) is conducted within six months of the 
marketing authorisation. In the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a 
result of the risk evaluation, confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 25/239 
 
 
 
validated and sensitive methods within a year after the marketing authorisation or at an earlier 
time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk 
mitigation steps should be implemented. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GLP 
Pivotal repeat-dose toxicology, genetic toxicology, carcinogenicity, and developmental and 
reproductive toxicology studies and safety pharmacology studies were conducted in compliance with 
US FDA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and ICH guidelines. Based on memos of 
understanding or mutual recognition agreements, studies conducted under US FDA GLP regulations are 
considered compliant in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-member 
and European Union (EU), member countries. 
The GLP status for test facilities was in general in compliance but the status GLP status of the ChanTest 
Corporation (Cleveland, OH USA; 2008-2009) performing the hERG assay could not be confirmed. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Bempedoic acid 
Bempedoic acid is a novel orally active small molecule with a molecular weight of 344.5 Da that upon 
activation by very long chain acyl-Coenzyme A synthetase 1 (ACSLV1) into bempedoyl-CoA (ETC-1002-
CoA) functions as a competitive inhibitor of adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL). ACL is an enzyme 
upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) and of acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 
the cholesterol biosynthesis  ACL converts citrate into acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which then is 
formed into HMG-CoA by ACC. S, this HMG-CoA is converted into mevalonic acid by HMG-CoA reductase. 
Selective inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, such as statins, decrease sterol (cholesterol) synthesis, while 
inhibitors of ACC reduce fatty acid synthesis and catabolism. An inhibition of ACL may therefore inhibit 
both cholesterol as fatty acid synthesis. An inhibition of cholesterol synthesis has been shown to result in 
an upregulation of hepatic LDL-R protein expression and increased clearance of LDL-C by LDL-R from 
plasma. 
Ezetimibe 
Ezetimibe, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-3(R)-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3(S)-hydroxypropyl]-4(S)-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-
azetidinone has the empirical formula C24H21F2NO3 and a molar mass of 409.4 g/mol. The substance is 
highly soluble in ethanol, methanol, and acetone but practically insoluble in water.  
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacodynamics: In vitro 
Bempedoic acid 
The Applicant demonstrated, using radiolabeled substrates, such as [14C]acetate, [3H]H2O, 
[14C]pyruvate, and [14C]glucose, as a metabolic precursors, that bempedoic acid inhibited de novo 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 26/239 
 
 
 
 
sterol and fatty acid synthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures and in livers of treated rats. The 
[14C]acetate incorporation into fatty acids and sterol fractions was reduced with an IC50 of 8.5 μM and 
3 μM, respectively. Inhibition of lipid synthesis was also demonstrated in primary human liver cells, 
where bempedoic acid blocked both fatty acid and sterol synthesis using labelled precursors. In 
addition, in both primary human hepatocytes and rat hepatoma cells, bempedoic acid increased sterol 
response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) gene transcription, LDL-R expression and LDL-R related 
uptake, which was also found with statin treatment. 
To determine the enzyme in the lipid synthesis pathway targeted by bempedoic acid, a quantitative 
assessment of multiple metabolic intermediates of lipid synthesis was conducted and bempedoic acid 
was found to reduce several metabolites including the product of ACL, acetyl-CoA, while transient 
increases in its substrate, citrate, were observed suggesting that bempedoic acid inhibited the lipid 
synthesis pathway at the point of ACL.  
Enzyme kinetic analyses in a cell free recombinant human ACL enzyme assay, however, demonstrated 
that not bempedoic acid but bempedoyl-CoA inhibited the ACL enzyme and that  bempedoic acid-CoA 
acted as a competitive inhibitor of ACL with respect to CoA competition (Ki = 2 μM) and not on ATP 
competition. The formation of CoA ester of bempedoic acid was shown to occur in rat liver microsomes 
incubated with bempedoic acid (10 μM) and up to 100 μM CoA. 
With respect to the other rate limiting enzymes within in the lipid biosynthetic pathway, neither 
bempedoic acid nor bempedoic acid-CoA inhibited HMG-CoA reductase and bempedoic acid did not 
inhibit ACC, while bempedoic acid-CoA demonstrated a weak inhibition of  ACC with an IC50 at 29 ± 5 
μM. In line with the absence of inhibition of sterol synthesis downstream of HMG-CoA reductase, 
bempedoic acid did not inhibit [14C]mevalonolactone incorporation in primary rat hepatocytes, which is 
consistent with an inhibition of sterol synthesis at the point of ACL and/or ACC . 
Using selective inhibitors, ACSVL1 was found to be the specific acylCoA synthetase (ACS) isoform that 
catalyzes the CoA activation of bempedoic acid. In primary human liver microsomes (n=8) a mean 
activity of 784.8 ± 124 pmol/mg/min was found. In addition, gene silencing of ACSVL1, using siRNA, 
strongly reduced bempedoic acid-CoA formation and the effect of bempedoic acid on de novo lipid 
synthesis in McArdle (rat hepatoma) cells.  
Ezetimibe 
Ezetimibe is a selective inhibitor of the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein, 
which is involved in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and related phytosterols. NPC1L1 is 
localized at the brush-border of the small intestine; and inhibition of NPC1L1 results in decreased 
absorption of biliary and dietary cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal 
cholesterol to the liver. 
Primary pharmacodynamics: in vivo 
Bempedoic acid 
The effects of bempedoic acid on lipid synthesis was studied in the diet-induced and cholestyramine 
fed Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat models of enhanced lipogenesis. The 14C-acetate incorporation in lipids 
(sterol and fatty acid) in serum and liver was dose-dependently reduced by bempedoic acid (3 - 
100 mg/kg, po). Such an inhibition of lipid synthesis was not found in a (fasted) model with non-
enhanced lipid synthesis. In high-fat high-cholesterol (HFHC)-fed male golden Syrian hamsters, 
bempedoic acid (30 mg/kg/day, po QD, 3 wks) induced a reduction in LDL-C and VLDL-C, triglycerides 
and cholesterol, while HDL-C levels remained unchanged.  
Bempedoic acid was also administered daily to normal chow-fed male SD rats (2 weeks) and Golden 
Syrian Hamsters (3 weeks) to assess the effects on normal, non-enhanced, lipid metabolism. The 
initial changes (Week 1), such as a decrease  in VLDL-C and triglyceride, were no longer observed after 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 27/239 
 
 
 
2 weeks due to a metabolic compensatory “rebound” response. In hamsters an increase in HDL-C 
levels without an effect on non-HDL-C levels was found.  
The obese Zucker Fatty rat has a mutation in the leptin receptor that induces hypertriglyceridemia with 
increased VLDL-C and decreased HDL-C levels. Bempedoic acid dose dependently increased HDL-C and 
β-HBA and decreased non-HDL-C, triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids, indicative of decreased 
de novo synthesis of fatty acids and increased metabolic utilization of triglycerides. 
In the apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mouse,  a model of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis in 
mice, bempedoic acid treatment (30 mg/kg, po, daily for 14 days) decreased LDL by 61% and 
increased HDL (+300%) and VLDL (+23%), while total cholesterol did not change. The cholesteryl 
ester content in vascular tissues was not significantly changed. After long-term bempedoic acid 
treatment (30 mg/kg, po, daily for 12 weeks) to ApoE mice, only LDL was reduced (38%), while no 
HDL or VLDL or total cholesterol change was seen. In addition to a reduction in plasma liver cholesterol 
(-28%) and liver triglycerides (-74%), a 2-fold upregulation of LDL-R in the liver was seen with 
bempedoic acid treatment. Whole aorta cholesterol content and vascular atherosclerotic lesion size, 
which were increased 2.5-fold and 7-fold, respectively, were attenuated 38% and 21%, respectively, 
by bempedoic acid treatment. In the ApoE & AMPKβ1 Double Knock-Out (DKO) mice similar lipid and 
LDL-R responses were seen with bempedoic acid treatment as found in the ApoE KO mouse although 
no liver AMPK activity was detected, suggesting independence of AMPK pathway.  
In both LDLR+/- and LDLR-/- Yucatan miniature pigs fed a HFHC diet, plasma cholesterol and LDL-C 
increased over the course of 160 days. Bempedoic acid treatment (120 or 240 mg/day, orally) reduced 
LDL-C leading to a ~50% and ~30% reduction in LDLR+/- and LDLR-/-, respectively, as compared to 
placebo after 160 days of treatment. No consistent effects of bempedoic acid were observed on HDL-C, 
VLDL, liver lipids or triglycerides. Bempedoic acid treatment decreased aortic and abdominal lesion size 
in these minipigs with about 50% as compared to placebo. 
Ezetimibe 
Cell culture and knock-out experiments in mice confirmed that ezetimibe reduces the small intestinal 
enterocyte uptake and absorption of cholesterol by binding to Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1), which 
keeps cholesterol in the intestinal lumen for excretion. Furthermore, the uptake of structurally related 
phytosterols seems to be mediated by the same mechanism. 
In rodent studies, ezetimibe was a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, potently inhibiting the 
absorption of biliary and dietary cholesterol from the small intestine without affecting the absorption of 
fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, fatty acids, progesterone, ethinyl estradiol, or bile acids irrespective 
of pancreatic function. Data in rats suggest that ezetimibe does discriminate by blocking the movement 
of exogenous cholesterol in the enterocyte before it reaches the intracellular cholesterol pool to be 
incorporated into intestinal lipoproteins, without affecting the incorporation of newly synthesized 
cholesterol into intestinal lipoproteins. 
Ezetimibe has been shown to be most potent preclinically in cholesterol-fed rhesus monkeys, where a 
dose-dependent effect occurred at a dose of 10 μg/kg, having a significant decrease in total cholesterol 
from 275 mg/dL to normal levels (approximately 150 mg/dL). A significant decrease in plasma 
concentrations of LDL-C from 140 to about 50 mg/dL was also noted. Furthermore, crossover studies 
(in which animals were first fed a high-cholesterol diet without ezetimibe and then switched to a high-
cholesterol diet with the compound, and vice versa) found that plasma cholesterol and LDL-C declined 
toward normal levels with the addition of the drug and rose when it was not administered. 
When intestinal cholesterol absorption is decreased the chylomicrons formed by the intestine contained 
less cholesterol and thus the delivery of cholesterol from the intestine to the liver was reduced in 
experiments using miniature pigs. This resulted in a decrease in the cholesterol content of the liver, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 28/239 
 
 
 
leading to the activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), which enhance the 
expression of LDL receptors resulting in an increase in LDL receptors on the plasma membrane of 
hepatocytes. Thus, a key element of the mechanism of action of ezetimibe is to decrease the levels of 
cholesterol in the liver resulting in an increase in the number of LDL receptors leading to the increased 
clearance of circulating LDL-C. In addition, the decreased cholesterol delivery to the liver may also 
decrease the formation and secretion of the precursor very-low density lipoprotein. 
Experiments in mice showed that, in addition to NPC1L1 expression in the intestine, this protein is also 
expressed in the liver where it mediates the transport of cholesterol from the bile back into the liver. 
The inhibition of NPC1L1 in the liver resulted in the increased secretion of cholesterol in bile and 
thereby could also contribute to a decrease in the cholesterol content of the liver and an increase in 
LDL receptor expression and a decrease in VLDL-C production. 
Primary pharmacodynamics: Metabolites 
Bempedoic acid 
ESP15228 (M1) is the 8-keto metabolite of bempedoic acid and is in humans a major metabolite. 
Therefore, also the pharmacological properties of this metabolite on lipid synthesis were analysed. 
ESP15228 inhibited the synthesis of both sterols and fatty acids in the primary rat hepatocyte model 
with an IC50 for both pathways of less than 3 μM, similar to bempedoic acid. In contrast to bempedoic 
acid or ESP15228, the glucuronides of bempedoic acid (M11) and of ESP15228 (M15) did not inhibit 
lipid synthesis in vitro at 100 μM in primary mouse hepatocytes, which corresponds to 7- and 50-times 
the circulating human Cmax. 
In vivo in cholestyramine-primed rats, ESP15228 displayed reduced hepatic fatty acid and sterol 
synthesis in the liver and in the obese Zucker Fatty rat model similar effects were found with 
ESP15228 as with bempedoic acid.  
ESP15228, however, did not inhibit ACC activity nor did ESP15228 activate the AMPK pathway.  
Ezetimibe 
After oral administration, ezetimibe is rapidly and extensively metabolised to a pharmacologically 
active phenolic glucuronide in humans and animal species. Ezetimibe undergoes glucuronidation to a 
single metabolite and localizes at the intestinal wall, where it binds with higher affinity for NPC1L1 to 
prevent cholesterol absorption. Enterohepatic recirculation of ezetimibe and/or its glucuronide ensures 
repeated delivery to the intestinal site of action and limited peripheral exposure. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics: in vitro 
Bempedoic acid 
Bempedoic acid had no significant effect (IC50 <100 μM) in an in vitro binding screen using a broad 
panel of isolated human receptors, ion channels, transporters, and enzymes. 
It was shown that ACSVL1 is not expressed in microsomes preparations from human skeletal muscle, 
or in primary human myotubes, or L6 myotubes, while ACSVL1 expression was highest in liver 
microsomes and expression in human kidney microsomes was only 10% of that observed in liver. 
Consistent with the lack of ACSVL1 expression in skeletal muscle, bempedoic acid-CoA was not formed 
in these tissues, and bempedoic acid did not suppress sterol synthesis or promote cytoxicity in rat and 
human myotube cultures. In addition, no signs of muscle-related toxicological effects were seen in rat, 
mouse or monkey upon long-term dosing. The muscle related complaints found with statins, myalgia, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 29/239 
 
 
 
may be related to its effect in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (mevalonate depletion leading to 
subsequent myotoxicity). Bempedoic acid, however, does not seem to impact cholesterol synthesis in 
muscle.  
Another difference with statins is its inhibitory effects on fatty acid biosynthesis. The coordination 
between fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation occurs at the level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
(ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis. ACC produces malonyl-CoA which is a potent 
allosteric inhibitor of the mitochondrial long chain fatty acid transporter protein carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I). In vitro studies with primary rat hepatocytes using a cofactor for CPT-I 
activity and a CPT-I  inhibitor suggest that the suppression of fatty acid synthesis by bempedoic acid 
activates CPT-I-dependent import of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for subsequent 
β-oxidation, and that bempedoic acid does not adversely affect intra-mitochondrial oxidation pathways. 
In vitro and in vivo studies showed that treatment with bempedoic acid coincided with increases in 
AMPKα phosphorylation, a marker of AMPK activation, which was found to be due to a direct, allosteric, 
interaction of bempedoic acid-CoA but not bempedoic acid with AMPK complexes in a β1-dependent 
manner. The contribution of AMPK activation to the pharmacodynamic effect of bempedoic acid in 
humans, if any, is expected to be low as the liver predominately expresses not β1 but AMPK 
β2-containing complexes and ACSVL1 is mainly expressed in the liver. 
In human monocyte-derived macrophages, bempedoic acid partially blocked the LPS-induced 
decreases in AMPK phosphorylation, which coincided with decreased production of some 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In vivo, bempedoic acid attenuates homing of leukocytes 
into inflammatory sites and inhibits adipose tissue inflammation in a mouse model of diet-induced 
obesity but whether these specific effects are observed in humans remains to be demonstrated. 
Given the low binding affinity, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activation was not 
considered a viable molecular target responsible for the effects of bempedoic acid on the lipid 
biosynthesis pathway. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics: In vivo 
Bempedoic acid 
In mice, daily bempedoic acid treatment (30 mg/kg/day, po, QD) for seven days slightly increased 
faecal neutral cholesterol excretion and increased gallbladder biliary cholesterol compared to vehicle, 
without affecting gallbladder biliary phospholipid content. Bempedoic acid had no effect on fractional 
cholesterol absorption, while ezetimibe (10 mg/kg/day, po, QD) completely blocked cholesterol 
absorption.  
LDL-R deficient mice maintained on high cholesterol containing diets develop hyperlipidemia, hepatic 
steatosis, and atherosclerosis. Treatment with bempedoic acid (po, QD, 10 - 100 mg/kg) for 12 or 16 
weeks induced strong reductions in diet-enhanced serum lipids, had profound reductions in aortic lipid 
content and dose-dependently reduced atherosclerotic lesions and an attenuation of the diet-induced 
inflammatory response in liver, plasma and aorta.  
The effects of bempedoic acid on triglycerides, glycemic control (glucose, insulin) and body weight 
were investigated in the hypertriglyceridemic obese KKAy mouse model of insulin resistance, diet-
induced obese (DIO) mice, male golden Syrian hamsters, on a fructose diet to induce hyperglycemia. 
In these rodent models, bempedoic acid was found to reduce triglycerides, and partly improve 
glycemic control. But given that these effects seem to be dependent on diet and bempedoic acid most 
of the times reduced body weight gain, the relevance of these effect for humans are unclear. 
Following 12 weeks of oral daily dosing in KKAy mice, which are hypertriglyceridemic, spontaneously 
obese and insulin resistant, bempedoic acid (10 & 60 mg/kg) reduces circulating and hepatic 
Assessment report

triglycerides, and partly improved glucose tolerance. The combined effects observed in the KKAy 
mouse model suggests bempedoic acid acts as a metabolic regulator of lipid and carbohydrate 
imbalances. 
DIO mice develop obesity, hyperinsulinemia, mild hyperglycemia, impaired insulin sensitivity, impaired 
glucose tolerance, and elevated hepatic triglycerides in response to the high (60%) fat diet. Treatment 
of these mice with bempedoic acid for 9 weeks, dose-dependently attenuated body weight gain and 
resulted in reductions in hepatic (46%) and plasma (26%) triglyceride content, fasting glucose (16%), 
and fasting insulin (92%). Reductions in HOMA-IR suggest reduced insulin resistance, while increases 
in QUICKI scores and reductions in insulin tolerance test glucose indicate improved insulin 
sensitization. Glucose tolerance tests demonstrated that DIO mice had impaired glucose tolerance 
relative to lean diet fed mice. Bempedoic acid, however, had no impact on glucose tolerance in this 
study.  
In male golden Syrian hamsters, on a 60% fructose diet to induce hyperglycemia (acute insulin 
resistance marked by impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity), bempedoic acid treatment 
resulted in improved postprandial glucose, improved glucose tolerance, and improved insulin sensitivity 
unrelated to fasting glucose or insulin levels. Bempedoic acid treatment reduced body weight gain and 
produced reductions in hepatic and plasma triglycerides although no changes in plasma total 
cholesterol or ApoB were observed.  
Finally, the effects of bempedoic acid on elevated blood pressure was investigated in female 
spontaneously hypertensive obese (SHROB) Koletsky rats but given that the SHROB rat model is a 
hyperphagic obesity driven model of hypertension, and that bempedoic acid was associated with 
reduced food consumption, it was not possible to determine whether the anti hypertensive effects or 
improvements in other outcomes observed in this study were directly and/or indirectly related to 
bempedoic acid treatment. 
Ezetimibe 
Ezetimibe inhibited the development of carotid artery (decrease of 97%) and aortic (decrease of  
71–87%) atherosclerosis in animal models. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Bempedoic acid 
In safety pharmacology studies, bempedoic acid administration was not associated with adverse effects 
on CNS, pulmonary, or cardiovascular function.  
Bempedoic acid had no significant effects on the inhibition of the hERG current at concentrations up to 
300 μM, while a slight increase (5.4%) was found at 1000 μM (345 μg/mL), which is at 575 times the 
anticipated Cmax of unbound bempedoic acid (0.6 μg/mL) at the proposed human dose of 180 mg. 
Therefore, no hERG-related effects on QT interval would be expected in humans. Furthermore, up to 
100 mg/kg given orally to male monkeys, bempedoic acid did not produce any significant change in 
cardiovascular parameter such as heart rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial), or ECG 
parameters (QRS duration, or PR, RR, or QT intervals). Thus, bempedoic acid did not affect 
cardiovascular function in monkeys. 
Bempedoic acid did not have any physiologically significant acute or residual effects on 
arousal/activity, autonomic, neuromuscular, or physiological functions but significant decreases in 
thermal response was observed in the rat at 100 mg/kg 4 and 24 hours postdose. 
Assessment report

There were no bempedoic acid related changes in any respiratory function parameters (respiratory 
rate, tidal volume, minute volume) in rats given single oral doses up to 100 mg/kg. Thus, bempedoic 
acid had no effect on pulmonary function. 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies have been performed concerning the potential effects of 
bempedoic acid to affect renal function/urinary parameters but this is evaluated in the general toxicity 
studies (rat/monkey).  
Ezetimibe 
From Halleck et al (2009) it is clear that safety pharmacology studies have been performed to evaluate 
neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory safety in animals. Considering that the large clinical 
experience to date with ezetimibe products, it is not expected that new safety concerns may be 
identified. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Bempedoic acid & Ezetimibe 
No apparent and consistent pharmacodynamic interactions with respect to LDL-C lowering in LDL-R 
deficient mice was observed when 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid was given for 2 weeks 
alone or in combination with atorvastatin at 10 or 30 mg/kg/day as the LDL baseline levels and 
changes were highly variable, not consistent over the different doses, and troubled by rebound effects 
on lipogenesis. 
In conclusion, bempedoic acid acts as a prodrug that requires activation by ACSLV1 to form 
bempedoic acid-CoA (ETC-1002-CoA), which mediates competitive inhibition of ACL. Inhibition of ACL 
decreases cholesterol synthesis in the liver leading to increased SREBP2 and LDL-R expression and LDL 
clearance from the blood. Inhibition of ACL by bempedoic acid-CoA decreases LDL-C via the same 
pathway as HMG-CoA reductase inhibition by statins but at an upstream enzyme step. In addition, 
unlike statins, an inhibition of liver fatty acid biosynthesis and a reduction in triglycerides was seen.  
Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine. 
The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 
1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. Ezetimibe 
localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to 
a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic 
cholesterol stores and an increase in LDL receptors, resulting in clearance of cholesterol from the 
blood. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bempedoic acid 
The PK profile of bempedoic acid was investigated following oral administration of 14C-bempedoic acid 
to rats, rabbits and monkeys. Toxicokinetic studies were performed in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. 
Methods of analysis 
Bempedoic acid and its active metabolite ESP15228 were analysed in serum of mice, rats, rabbits and 
monkeys using validated LC-MS/MS methods. Regarding selectivity, carry-over, calibration, accuracy, 
precision, dilution integrity, matrix effect and stability, the methods were sufficiently validated. 
Validated LC-MS/MS methods were also used for the measurement of ezetimibe and ezetimibe 
Assessment report

glucuronide in serum of rats and atorvastatin, and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin in 
serum of monkeys in combination studies. In distribution studies in rats, radioactivity in tissues was 
analysed by whole body autoradiography (single dose studies) or liquid scintillation counting (repeated 
dose study). Metabolite profiling in plasma, urine, bile (rats only), liver and feces of rats and monkeys 
and in plasma of rabbits was performed by HPLC. The metabolites were identified using LC-MS/MS on 
all peaks accounting for > 2% of sample radioactivity. Radioactivity in excreta was analysed using 
liquid scintillation counting. 
Absorption 
Bempedoic acid was highly permeable through Caco-2 cell monolayers. The efflux ratio of 0.7 indicates 
that bempedoic acid permeates Caco-2 cell monolayers primarily by a passive mechanism. 
In repeated dose studies in mice, exposure increased approximately dose-proportionally. Exposure 
decreased with time.  
In rats, Tmax was 8 h and elimination half-life was 27 h after oral administration of a single dose of 
100 mg/kg bempedoic acid.  After administration of 10 mg/kg of 14C-bempedoic acid, Tmax of 
radioactivity was 2 h and elimination half-life was 18 h, suggesting delayed absorption at the higher 
dose. Volume of distribution of bempedoic acid was 123 mL/kg, indicating that it was not distributed 
beyond the extracellular fluid in rats. Comparison of intact and bile duct-cannulated rats showed the 
occurrence of enterohepatic recirculation (contributing approximately 39% to the total AUC). No study 
with IV administration was performed and therefore, oral bioavailability could not be calculated. 
However, the mass balance study demonstrated that bioavailability was at least 90% in rats. In 
repeated dose studies in rats, concentrations of bempedoic acid and ESP15228 increased more than 
dose-proportionally up to 100 mg/kg/day, while it increased less than dose-proportionally at higher 
doses, suggesting saturation of the absorption mechanism at the higher doses. Exposure decreased 
with time, except in pregnant rats, where this effect was less. In juvenile rats, Cmax at 10 mg/kg/day 
was comparable to adult rats. AUC0-24h on day 1 in juvenile rats was slightly higher than in adult 
rats; afterwards, it was comparable. 
After oral administration of 20 mg/kg of 14C-bempedoic acid to rabbits, Tmax was 4 hours. Elimination 
half-life of radioactivity was 10-13 h. In pregnant rabbits, exposure increased in time from gestation 
day 6 to 18. Accumulation ratio was ≤ 2 for bempedoic acid and 2.6-4.0 for ESP15228 (based on 
AUC0-24h).   
After oral administration of 10 mg/kg of 14C-bempedoic acid to cynomolgus monkeys, Tmax was 1 
hour. Elimination half-life of total radioactivity from plasma was 18 h. No evidence of enterohepatic 
recirculation was found. No study with IV administration was performed and therefore, oral 
bioavailability could not be calculated. From the mass balance study it can only be concluded that the 
bioavailability was at least 49%. In repeated dose studies in monkeys, AUC of bempedoic acid and 
ESP15228 increased more than dose-proportionally at doses from 10 to 60 mg/kg/day and 
approximately dose-proportionally from 50 to 500 mg/kg/day. Cmax increased approximately dose-
proportionally in monkeys. Exposure increased in time. Accumulation ratio in monkeys was 2.0-2.4 for 
bempedoic acid and 2.0-2.9 for ESP15228. 
No consistent gender effects were observed in mice and monkeys. In rats, no gender effect was 
observed in the exposure to bempedoic acid. Exposure to ESP15228 was slightly lower in females than 
in males in adult rats, but not in juvenile rats.  
Food effect was not studied in the non-clinical studies.

Distribution 
Protein binding of bempedoic acid was high and similar between species (mouse, rat, monkey and 
human) up to 100 µg/mL (94-97%). ESP15228 and bempedoic acid glucuronide were also highly 
protein bound in human plasma (99%). Radioactivity was quickly distributed in tissues of rats with 
maximal tissue concentrations at 2 h post-dose. For most tissues, except liver and kidney, the tissue-
blood (T/B) ratio was found to be <1. The highest concentrations were found in liver, kidney and lung 
and in contents of the GI tract. The liver is the main target organ of toxicity in rats (see section 4.2). 
There was no retention in melanin-containing tissue. At 168 h after administration, only low 
concentrations were found in liver, kidney and the GI tract. After 14 days dosing with 10 mg/kg/day, 
maximal concentration in the liver was approximately 2-fold higher compared to single dose, while 
concentrations in kidney, skeletal muscle and whole blood were comparable to those after single 
dosing. Bempedoic acid-related radioactivity did not preferentially partition into red blood cells of rats, 
rabbits and monkeys. Placental transfer and excretion in milk have not been studied. 
Metabolism 
In hepatocytes of mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey and human, the largest metabolite found was 
bempedoic acid glucuronide conjugate and to a lesser extent ESP15228-glucuronide conjugate. In 
addition, 11 minor metabolites were found. A study in human hepatic microsomes showed that P450 
enzymes are not involved in the metabolism of bempedoic acid and ESP15228. In human hepatic 
microsomes, UGT2B7 was identified as the enzyme responsible for the glucuronidation of bempedoic 
acid and ESP15228. Some induction of CYP2C8 activity by bempedoic acid was found at 300 µM in 
human hepatocytes of 3 donors. An increase in CYP2C8 mRNA content was found in 1 donor. At 300 
µM, also some induction of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 was observed, but to a lower extent than 
CYP2C8 and with no increase in mRNA content. Since 300 µM corresponds to approximately 5x the 
human Cmax at a dose of 180 mg/day, and no significant induction was observed at 30 µM, these 
effects are not expected to be clinically significant. In human hepatic microsomes, no significant 
inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 by 
bempedoic acid was observed. UGT1A1 was inhibited by bempedoic acid and bempedoic acid 
glucuronide by ≥ 50%. UGT1A3 was inhibited by bempedoic acid by approximately 50%. Because the 
study was performed using concentrations of 10x human Cmax, the potential for UGT inhibition at 
clinically relevant concentrations is expected to be low. 
The parent compound bempedoic acid was the major component in plasma of rats, rabbits and 
monkeys. The most important metabolic pathway is conjugation, mainly with glucuronide but also (to a 
minor extent) with glutathione, taurine and glycerol. A minor pathway found in all investigated species 
was the formation of the keto-metabolite ESP15228. In rats, a relevant pathway was the formation of 
hydroxylated or acid metabolites of which the most important (rats) was M2, mono-hydroxymethyl 
bempedoic acid. In monkey, also a glucuronide of ESP15228 was formed (M15), while M2 could not be 
found in plasma of monkeys. Metabolism in monkeys corresponded well to metabolism in humans, with 
the parent compound comprising the major part of radioactivity in plasma and the formation of 
ESP15228, bempedoic acid glucuronide (M11) and ESP15228 glucuronide (M15), though in humans, 
larger parts are converted into M11 and M15 than in monkeys. Metabolism in rats corresponded less 
well to human metabolism since M11 and M15 were not found in plasma of rats and ESP15228 in lower 
amounts than in humans and monkeys. There are no unique major human metabolites. However, M15 
was found only in low amounts in plasma of monkeys (1.8-2.7% of sample radioactivity between 4 and 
24 h after dosing) and it was not found in rats. This is not expected to be a problem for safety though, 
because M15 is the glucuronide conjugate of ESP15228, which was formed in sufficient amounts in 
monkeys and can be considered sufficiently investigated, and the glucuronide of ESP15228 is not 
expected to be more toxic than ESP15228.

Excretion 
Following oral administration of 14C-bempedoic acid to rats, excretion of total radioactivity occurred 
primarily via the bile (86% of dose) and to a lesser extent via urine (17% of dose). The rat data show 
that bempedoic acid was well-absorbed in rats (oral bioavailability was at least 90%). Total recovery 
was high in rats (97% after 120 h in intact rats and 93% after 48 h in bile duct-cannulated rats) and 
slightly lower in monkeys (86% after 120 h). Following oral administration of 14C-bempedoic acid to 
cynomolgus monkeys, excretion occurred for a larger part in urine (49% of dose) than in feces (29% 
of dose) at 120 h post-dose. Regarding oral bioavailability in monkeys, it can only be concluded that it 
was at least 49%. Excretion in humans occurred primarily via urine (~70% of the dose) and therefore, 
in this respect, the monkey is a more clinically relevant animal model than the rat. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
A combination of bempedoic acid (30 mg/kg/day) and ezetimibe (750 mg/kg/day in male rats, 250 
mg/kg/day in non-pregnant female rats and 183-720 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats) had no effect on the 
exposure to bempedoic acid and ESP15228 in rats (males and non-pregnant females as well as 
pregnant rats), compared to administration of bempedoic acid alone. Effects of the combination on 
ezetimibe exposure were not consistent, most likely due to extensive enterohepatic cycling of 
ezetimibe/ezetimibe glucuronide. When ezetimibe was combined with 30 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid, 
exposure to ezetimibe + ezetimibe glucuronide increased at least 2 times. In combination with 10 
mg/kg/day bempedoic acid, only a slight increase in exposure to ezetimibe + ezetimibe glucuronide 
(approximately 10-30%) was observed. The exposures to bempedoic acid, ESP15228, atorvastatin and 
2-hydroxyatorvastatin in cynomolgus monkeys were not significantly affected by the combination 
compared to when bempedoic acid (20 mg/kg/day) or atorvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) were administered 
alone. 
Ezetimibe 
Ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed from the intestinal lumen and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism 
(>95% glucuronidation) in the intestinal wall to form the active metabolite. After oral administration of 
5 mg/kg ezetimibe for 14 days, wild type rats showed a mean (± standard deviation [SD]) area under 
the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24h) of 74.6 ± 26.3 ng·h/mL for 
ezetimibe and 556 ± 591 ng·h/mL for the glucuronide. In bile duct-cannulated rats, ezetimibe was 
glucuronidated, moved through the intestinal wall, into portal plasma, through the liver, and into bile.  
Via bile, the drug was then delivered back to its intestinal site of action.  The glucuronidated ezetimibe 
localises more avidly to the intestine than ezetimibe itself.  Ezetimibe is primarily metabolised in the 
small intestine and liver via glucuronide conjugation (a phase II reaction) with subsequent biliary and 
renal excretion.  Minimal oxidative metabolism (a phase I reaction) has been observed in all species 
evaluated. The major part of ezetimibe is conjugated to the benzylic glucuronide by uridine 
diphosphate (UDP) -glucuronosyltransferases 1A1, 1A3, and 2B15.  A minor amount of ezetimibe is 
conjugated to the phenolic glucuronide by UDP -glucuronosyltransferase 2B7. Ezetimibe is 
predominantly excreted via faeces.    
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Bempedoic acid 
Bempedoic acid showed low oral acute toxic potential in rats and monkeys. The oral LD50 was > 1000 
mg/kg in rats and >2000 mg/kg in monkeys. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020

In rats, body weight gain was decreased in males 14 days after dosing. In monkeys, body weight loss 
and emesis was observed in both sexes, but without a clear dose-relation. Food consumption was 
decreased at ≥500 mg/kg. Slight increases in liver and kidney related parameters and decreases in 
glucose were noted in both species. 
Ezetimibe  
Although it is indicated by the applicant that in the original marketing application for ezetimibe acute 
oral gavage and intraperitoneal studies in rats and mice were performed, as well as an oral capsule 
study in dogs, no results are included in the dossier. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Bempedoic acid 
In mice, treatment with bempedoic acid by oral gavage was associated with decreased plasma glucose 
levels (starting at 300 mg/kg) and adverse effects on the liver (hepatocellular degeneration; 
hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration; diffuse vacuolation; increased Kupffer cell pigment and 
centrilobular to panlobular hepatocellular hypertrophy at all doses, and increased ALP, AST and ALT 
levels and individual hepatocyte necrosis at doses ≥300 mg/kg/day). In addition, testes and seminal 
vesicle weight were decreased, associated with seminiferous tubule degeneration/atrophy. At the 
highest dose (1000 mg/kg), 3 females were found dead or  were euthanatized in extremis due to poor 
condition and clinical signs. At this dose, erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were also 
decreased. 
Bempedoic acid induced liver toxicity in rats, shown by increased liver enzymes (ALP, GGT, ALT, AST), 
accompanied by increased liver weight and microscopic findings (centrilobular to panlobular 
hepatocellular hypertrophy, individual hepatocyte necrosis, hepatocellular vacuolation, bile duct 
hyperplasia). The microscopic effects in the liver were not completely reversed after  4 weeks 
recovery. According to the applicant, hepatocellular hypertrophy without further microscopic hepatic 
changes such as necrosis is not considered adverse. However, there is a clear dose-relationship in all 
studies, with hepatocellular hypertrophy as the first sign of liver damage, which progresses at 
increasing doses. Therefore, according to the assessor, hypertrophy should be considered as the first 
sign of adverse liver damage. 
Reduced erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and haematocrit were also observed in rats, as well as increased 
numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. In addition, decreases in prothrombin time 
(PT) and in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were observed.  
High dose levels induced clinical signs, as moribundity, impaired limb function, hunched posture, thin 
appearance, decreased activity, ataxia, tonic convulsions, prostration, skin cold to the touch, lateral 
recumbency, and abnormal breathing. 
Furthermore, bempedoic acid treatment in rats resulted in decreased body weight and increased 
glucose, calcium, and cholesterol levels. Only at the highest dose in the 6 month study, a decrease in 
glucose levels was observed. Considering the pharmacologic effect of bempedoic acid, an increase in 
cholesterel is unexpected. However, this can be explained by a metabolic compensatory response at 
low doses (see 2.1.2). 
Kidney effects (increased creatinine and increased incidence and severity of the renal tubular 
dilatation) were observed in the 3 month study, but not in the 1 and 6 month studies. An enlarged 
spleen, accompanied by extramedullary hematopoiesis was only observed in the 1 month study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020

In the monkey, decreased body weight, reduced circulating red cell mass, prolonged APTT and PT were 
observed. The effects on the liver were less prominent in the monkey compared to adverse liver effects 
in rodents, and were restricted to increased liver weight, centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy and 
periportal hepatocellular vacuolation. This can be explained by the fact that bempedoic acid 
metabolism in rodents occurs predominantly via the liver, whereas in monkeys it is shifted more 
towards the kidney. It is noted that, with respect to metabolism, the monkey more closely resembles 
the human than the rodent, and therefore liver effects observed in monkey are more relevant for 
humans.  
Increased creatinine levels were observed in all pivotal monkey studies, however, no related 
microscopic changes were observed in the kidney. 
In the 3 month study, morphological changes were observed in the bone marrow that were indicative 
of early myelofibrosis and cytotoxicity. 
In all species, overall, adverse effects seemed to be slightly more pronounced in females. 
Combination studies with bempedoic acid and ezetimibe in rats up to 3 months resulted in similar 
effects and with similar magnitude as bempedoic acid alone. 
Combined administration of bempedoic acid and atorvastatin in monkeys resulted in mortality at dose 
levels where either of the products alone did not result in severe toxic effects. Combination resulted in 
exaggeration of effects observed with atorvastatin alone and included gastrointestinal effects 
(red/watery feces, hemorrhage/inflammation in large intestine) and findings consistent with 
inflammation (increased neutrophils and/or monocytes and fibrinogen), correlating with bone marrow 
granulocytic hyperplasia at high doses. Depletion of splenic red pulp was also observed. 
Hepatic toxicity, including an increase in liver enzymes, panlobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, 
centrilobular hepatocellular vacuolation and necrosis were also observed in the animals receiving 
combination treatment.  
The results indicate that atorvastatin in combination with bempedoic acid can result in excessive 
toxicity. However, according to the applicant, no adverse effects were observed at a combination of 20 
mg/kg bempedoic acid and 5 mg/kg atorvastatin, however, red and watery feces was observed in all 
treatment groups receiving atorvastatin (alone or in combination with bempedoic acid) which were not 
fully reversed in the recovery period.  
Ezetimibe 
Exposure to high doses (20x and 8-10x the human exposure in rats and dogs) of ezetimibe induce 
toxicity in heart and lymph nodes in rats and dogs and in kidney and bone marrow in rats. The 
combination with statins also induces liver effects in rats and dogs, but such effects are not observed 
in humans receiving combination therapy with ezetimibe and statins. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
Bempedoic acid 
Bempedoic acid was not mutagenic in the Ames test. Increases in chromosome aberration were 
observed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro, but only in the presence of S9 and at a 
concentration associated with a level of cytotoxicity that approached or exceeded the maximum 
permissible. No DNA damage in liver (rat) and genotoxic effects in bone marrow in rats and mice were 
observed. It can therefore be concluded that these studies indicate that bempedoic acid is not 
genotoxic. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 37/239 
 
 
 
The carcinogenic potential of bempedoic acid was evaluated in a 2-year study in mice and rats. In mice 
bempedoic acid was administered daily orally at doses of 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg/day. In males, an 
increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was observed at mid dose and higher 
in a dose responsive manner. 
In a 2-year study, rats were administered daily oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid. 
Treatment was associated with an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and thyroid follicular 
cell adenomas  in male rats. In both rats and mice, no carcinogenic potential was observed in females. 
The applicant suggests that the bempedoic acid-related increases in tumor incidence are attributable to 
PPARα activity. Indeed, this theory is consistent with the results observed in the repeated dose studies 
in rats (but not monkeys) and in vitro studies showing low potency activation of PPARα in liver, but 
absence of PPAR-mediated adverse effects in other organs (heart, skeletal muscles and bone marrow). 
Furthermore, the carcinogenic response is similar to that observed in mice and rats treated with other 
PPARα agonists. Since it is known that PPARα activation-mediated mechanism of tumor development is 
rodent-specific, the observed carcinogenesis in liver is not considered relevant for humans. In addition, 
the development of thyroid tumors in rats is considered to be secondary to increased liver metabolism 
of thyroid hormone (related with PPARα activators) and is therefore also not considered relevant for 
humans. 
Ezetimibe 
A standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays did not indicate any genotoxic potential 
for Ezetimibe. Overall, it is not likely that ezetimibe alone or in combination with statins, is 
carcinogenic. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Bempedoic acid 
In the repeated dose toxicity study in mice with bempedoic acid, testes and seminal vesicle weight 
were decreased, associated with seminiferous tubule degeneration/atrophy. 
In the combined oral fertility Study with bempedoic acid in rats, treated males were mated with 
treated females from the same dose group. Although no effects were observed on fertility indices, a 
decreased number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, viable embryos, and litter size was observed at 
the mid dose and an increase in estrous cycle length and pre-implantation loss as well as a decrease in 
sperm count (16%) were observed at the high dose. 
Extrapolation from rat TK repeat dose studies indicate that exposures at the NOAEL was 5 times below 
those obtained in humans. These findings are likely relevant for humans. 
In the rat embryo-fetal development study, maternal toxicity was evident from the mid-dose on, 
which, according to the applicant, resulted in foetal toxicity in the form of reduced fetal weight and an 
increased number of skeletal malformations and variations. These effects can be considered as skeletal 
retardations, associated with delays in ossification, and are transient and reversible after birth.  
In the rabbit embryo-fetal development study, maternal toxicity was evident at the high dose, 
however, no effects on fetal development or induction of malformations or variations were observed in 
the rabbit. The NOAEL for development was 80 mg/kg (AUC0-24 of ETC-1002 plus ESP15228 3906 
μg
hr/mL), associated with approximately 12 times human exposure at 180 mg/day. 
In the pre- and postnatal development study in the rat, bempedoic acid produced excessive maternal 
⋅
toxicity and increased neonatal mortality at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg. The NOAEL for F1 pup growth, survival, 
and behavioural assessments (slower learning) was 5 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL for the postweaning 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 38/239 
 
 
 
maturation and reproductive performance of the F1 generation was 20 mg/kg/day. Extrapolation from 
other studies indicate that exposures at the NOAEL for the postweaning maturation and reproductive 
performance were similar to those obtained in humans. These findings are likely relevant for humans. 
In a dose range finding study in juvenile rats, toxicity leading to excessive body weight loss and 
moribundity was seen at a dose of 60/30 mg/kg/day. A dose of 10 mg/kg/day was therefore chosen as 
the high dose in in the pivotal juvenile Study. 
In the dose range finding study and the pivotal Study, a similar toxicological profile compared to that 
found in adult rats was observed, including decreased body weight gain, decreased red cell mass, 
increased cholesterol and reversible, adaptive liver changes. Exposures at the NOAEL in juvenile rats 
(10 mg/kg/day) were approximately 0.2 times exposure in humans at 180 mg/day, comparable to 
exposures in adult rats at the NOAEL. 
Ezetimibe 
In rats, increased incidences of common fetal skeletal findings (extra pair of thoracic ribs, unossified 
cervical vertebral centra, shortened ribs) were observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times 
the human exposure).  Extra thoracic ribs were also observed in high dosed rabbits (150 times the 
human dose). Studies in rats and rabbits showed that ezetimibe can cross the placenta and is 
transferred to the milk. 
Bempedoic acid & ezetimibe 
Similar effects were observed in the rat embryo-fetal development study with bempedoic acid plus 
ezetimibe as in the study with only bempedoic acid. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Bempedoic acid 
Maximal exposure multiples achieved in the toxicology studies were in general sufficient: Based on 
AUC0-24h, for bempedoic acid it was up to 26x, 18x, 11x and 16x human AUC (at MRHD) in mice, 
rats, rabbits and monkeys respectively. For ESP15228 it was up to 14x, 7.8x, 2.9x and 18x human 
AUC in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys respectively. In juvenile rats, the exposure was low, maximally 
1.2x the (adult) human exposure to bempedoic acid and below human exposure for ESP15228. It is 
noted that the applicant uses human systemic exposures (AUC0-24) of 289 and 51.2 μg∙hr/mL for  
bempedoic acid and ESP15228, respectively (sum 340 μg∙hr/mL). Since the origin of these values is 
not clear, the assessor has used the values derived from Study 1002-035 instead to calculate exposure 
margins.   
The metabolite ESP15228 was a minor metabolite in mice, rats and rabbits (around 5% of bempedoic 
acid or less). ESP15228 was a larger metabolite in monkeys (around 10% of bempedoic acid or more).  
In mice, rats and monkeys, mortality was observed starting at exposures between 7 and 14 times the 
systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. The proposed mechanism for the mortality is severe 
hypoglycaemia occurring at exposures in excess of those required for the pharmacologic activity of 
bempedoic acid. 
Effects on red blood cell mass in mice, rats and monkeys and were observed already at low dose 
levels, corresponding to 0.15 (rat) to 6.2 times the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. The 
effects were moderate (≤15%) and no meaningful effects were observed in the clinical studies and are 
therefore not considered relevant for humans. However, decreases in APTT and PT were also observed 
in rats at exposure levels ≥ 0.15 the systemic exposure in humans at MRHD.  Although the findings 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 39/239 
 
 
 
lack microscopic correlates, we do not agree with the applicant that changes up to 38% are not 
clinically relevant. Especially in combination with anticoagulants risks due to interactions cannot be 
excluded. 
Bempedoic acid also results in hepatic toxicity, starting with increased levels of hepatic enzymes and 
progressing via hepatocellular hypertrophy and vacuolation and in rats also to necrosis. The effects are 
more pronounced in rats and mice than in monkeys which can be explained by the known adaptive 
response of rodents as well as by the fact that bempedoic acid metabolism is shifted more towards the 
liver in rodents than in monkeys and humans. In the monkey, the most relevant species for humans, 
periportal or diffuse vacuolation in liver was observed in the 12 month study at exposure levels twice 
the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. 
Increased plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels were also observed in the 12 month starting at 
exposure levels twice the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. However, up to 13 times human 
exposure at 180 mg, no microscopic changes in the kidney were observed. 
In the reproductive toxicity studies in rats, decreased corpora lutea and implantation sites, increased 
post-implantation loss and resorptions and reduced foetal body weight were observed at exposures 4 
times the systemic exposure in humans at 180 mg. In addition, increased incidence of foetal skeletal 
findings in the scapula and long bones as well as reductions in numbers of live pups and pup survival, 
pup growth and learning were observed at exposures below the systemic exposure in humans at 180 
mg. Considering the low or absent exposure margins, it is concluded that these effects might be 
relevant for humans. 
Bempedoic acid & ezetimibe 
A combination of bempedoic acid (30 mg/kg/day) and ezetimibe (750 mg/kg/day in male rats, 250 
mg/kg/day in non-pregnant female rats and 183-720 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats) had no effect on the 
exposure to bempedoic acid and ESP15228 in rats (males and non-pregnant females as well as 
pregnant rats), compared to administration of bempedoic acid alone. 
Effects of the combination on ezetimibe exposure were not consistent, most likely due to extensive 
enterohepatic cycling of ezetimibe/ezetimibe glucuronide. When ezetimibe was combined with 30 
mg/kg/day bempedoic acid, exposure to ezetimibe + ezetimibe-glucuronide increased at least 2 times. 
In combination with 10 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid, only a slight increase in exposure (approximately 
10-30%) was observed. 
In the 3 month study in rats with the combination treatment of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe, no 
adverse effects were observed up to 30/750 mg/kg/day (males) and 30/250 mg/kg/day (females). At 
these dose levels, systemic exposure (based on AUC0-24) to ezetimibe plus ezetimibe glucuronide is 
23 times (males) or 191 times (females) exposure in humans at 10 mg/day. Systemic exposure to 
ETC-1002 plus ESP15228 at these doses is 1.5-2.5 times exposure in humans at 180 mg/day. This is 
considered sufficient. 
Bempedoic acid & statins 
The exposures to bempedoic acid, ESP15228, atorvastatin and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin in cynomolgus 
monkeys were not significantly affected by the combination compared to when bempedoic acid (20 
mg/kg/day) or atorvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) were administered alone. 
In the pivotal 3 month study in monkeys with combination treatment of bempedoic acid and 
atorvastatin, red and watery feces was observed in all treatment groups receiving 5 mg/kg 
atorvastatin. At this dose level, systemic exposure to atorvastatin plus 2-hydroxyatorvastatin is 0.8 
times exposure in humans at 80 mg/day, which means that there is no safety margin. No bempedoic 
acid-related adverse effects were observed in the groups receiving up to 20 mg/kg bempedoic acid, a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 40/239 
 
 
 
dose that resulted in systemic exposure levels to ETC-1002 plus ESP15228 of 3-4 times exposure in 
humans at 180 mg/day, which is considered small, but sufficient. 
Local Tolerance  
Bempedoic acid is intended for oral route of administration, and therefore local tolerance studies are 
not needed. 
Other toxicity studies 
Interspecies comparison 
Bempedoic acid 
Bempedoic acid was absorbed moderately fast (Tmax 1-3.5 h in humans, 2 h in rats at 10 mg/kg, 4 h 
in pregnant rabbits, 1 h in monkeys). In rats at 100 mg/kg, Tmax was 8 h, but at that dose there was 
probably saturation of an absorption mechanism. Oral bioavailability was not directly investigated. It 
was at least 90% in rats and at least 49% in monkeys. Exposure to bempedoic acid increased dose-
proportionally in mice. In rats and monkeys, exposure increased more than dose-proportionally at 
lower doses (rat up to 100 mg/kg/day, monkey up to 60 mg/kg/day) and less than dose-proportionally 
at higher doses. In humans, steady-state pharmacokinetics were generally linear over a range of > 60 
mg to 220 mg.  
No consistent gender effects were observed in mice and monkeys. In rats, no gender effect was 
observed in the exposure to bempedoic acid. Exposure to ESP15228 was slightly lower in females than 
in males in adult rats, but not in juvenile rats. In humans, females had a 41% greater increase in 
steady-state AUC compared with males. 
In mice and rats, upon multiple dosing, exposure generally decreased with time. In pregnant rabbits, 
monkeys and humans, exposure increased with time (accumulation ratio ≤ 2, 2.0-2.4 and 2.3 in 
pregnant rabbits, monkeys and humans respectively). 
Protein binding of bempedoic acid was high and similar between species (mouse, rat, monkey, human) 
up to 100 µg/mL (94-97%). In rats, bempedoic acid distributed to a volume less than the extracellular 
fluid (Vd/F was 123 mL/kg). In humans, Vz/F was 18 L, corresponding approximately to the 
extracellular fluid (Davies & Morris, 1993). In all species, bempedoic acid did not preferentially 
partition into red blood cells. 
The major circulating metabolites in monkeys and humans were bempedoic acid, bempedoic acid 
glucuronide, ESP15228 and ESP15228 glucuronide. In rat plasma, the glucuronides of bempedoic acid 
and ESP15228 were not present. Instead, mono-hydroxymethyl bempedoic acid was present in plasma 
of rats. 
Elimination half-life was comparable in rats (18-27 h), monkeys (18 h) and humans (16-33 h). In 
pregnant rabbits elimination half-life was shorter (10-13 h). In monkeys and humans, the largest part 
of a radioactive dose was excreted in urine (49% and 70% respectively), while in faeces, 29% and 
30% of the dose was excreted respectively. In rats only 17% of the dose was excreted in urine while 
86% was excreted in bile.  
Bempedoic acid & ezetimibe 
In combination studies with ezetimibe in rats and humans, ezetimibe had no effect on the exposure to 
bempedoic acid. In rats, exposure to ezetimibe + ezetimibe-glucuronide increased at least 2 times in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 41/239 
 
 
 
combination with 30 mg/kg/day bempedoic acid but not in combination with 10 mg/kg/day bempedoic 
acid. In humans, total ezetimibe increased 1.6-1.8 times in combination with bempedoic acid. 
Bempedoic acid & atorvastatin 
In combination studies with atorvastatin in monkeys and humans, atorvastatin had no effect on the 
exposure to bempedoic acid. In monkey, bempedoic acid had no effect on atorvastatin exposure while 
in humans only a small increase (1.4x) was observed. 
Impurities  
Three alkyl compounds in the synthesis of bempedoic acid contain halides and may therefore be 
mutagenic. The starting material 1-bromo-5-chloropentane and a synthetic intermediate heptanoic 
acid, 2,2-dimethyl-7-iodo-ethyl ester (CION-02) were evaluated in bacterial mutagenicity assays. No 
evidence for mutagenicity was observed. The third compound (CION-01) is similar to CION-02 
(contains chlorine instead of iodine) was considered to be not mutagenic given the results for CION-02. 
In addition, the potential impurity CION-08-diol was evaluated for mutagenic potential using in silico 
methods. No structural alerts associated with mutagenicity were found. 
Other 
Bempedoic acid  
The applicant performed several in vitro Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Assays. The results 
indicate that bempedoic acid binding has low potential to activate the PPARα or PPARγ pathways and 
no potential to activate the PPARδ pathway. 
Exploratory mechanisms of toxicity 
Studies towards the mechanism of toxicity of bempedoic acid were performed in rats and monkeys. In 
those studies, high doses of bempedoic acid (100-300 mg/kg) resulted in dose- and time-dependent 
decreases in plasma glucose in both species, with a reduction of up to 72%-80% in surviving animals, 
but even more in animals that needed to be euthanised. In addition, hypoglycemia-induced clinical 
signs were observed in rats and monkeys, including decreased activity, emesis and vomiting (repeated 
and occurring in primates only), hunched posture, pallor and tremors. All these effects were reversed 
during recovery. Further studies indicated that glucose uptake and utilization pathways remain intact. 
In rat, mild increases in lactate and pyruvate were observed. Nevertheless, increased glucose oxidation 
as the mechanism for hypoglycemia is not likely to be a major contributor since analysis of lactate and 
pyruvate do not indicate a change in glucose oxidation in monkeys. Therefore, it is concluded that the 
mechanism leading to decreases in glucose after exposure to high doses of bempedoic acid likely is 
decreased gluconeogenesis. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bempedoic acid  
Bempedoic acid is considered to be not PBT, nor vPvB. A risk to the STP, surface water, groundwater, 
sediment and terrestrial compartment is not anticipated based on the prescribed use of bempedoic 
acid.  
Ezetimibe  
An ERA has not yet been provided for ezetimibe, but will be provided to EMA by 31 July 2020, 
assuming that required laboratory testing is limited. In the event terrestrial testing is triggered, the 
ERA report will be completed in January 2021.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Bempedoic acid  
In general, the non-clinical pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid have been adequately investigated. 
However, in the validation of the LC-MS/MS methods which were used to analyse bempedoic acid and 
ESP15228 in serum, medium QC was chosen consequently lower than recommended in the Guideline 
on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev 1 Corr 2) (at approximately 
10% of the calibration curve range instead of at 30 – 50% as recommended in the guideline). The 
applicant has performed additional partial validations of the LC-MS/MS methods, including QCs at 
around 30 to 50% of the calibration curve range as recommended by the EMA guidance. Reported 
intra-run accuracy and precision values are adequate. 
The results indicate that atorvastatin in combination with bempedoic acid can result in excessive 
toxicity. According to the applicant, no adverse effects were observed at a combination of 20 mg/kg 
bempedoic acid and 5 mg/kg atorvastatin. However, in the pivotal 3 month study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys (RR 1002-500-065), red and watery feces was observed in all treatment groups receiving 
atorvastatin (alone or in combination with bempedoic acid), which were not fully reversed in the 
recovery period. According to the applicant, changes in stool are common, stress related effects in 
monkeys. The fecal abnormalities were already observed in all groups before treatment started. 
Moreover, the discoloured feces in recovery animals were grey or green, but not red or bloody and the 
lack of clinical chemistry changes as well as the absence of gross or microscopic findings in the 
histological analysis at termination, indicates that no intestinal injuries were present. Since also in the 
clinical studies no meaningful gastrointestinal adverse events were observed, it can be concluded that 
the observed fecal abnormalities in monkeys do not raise concern for humans. 
The bempedoic acid-dependent hypoglycemia and clinical signs of moribundity were evident with 
high dose exposure in non-clinical repeat-dose toxicity studies in rodent and monkeys. However, such 
effects occur only at exposure levels not relevant for humans. In addition, the biochemical changes 
leading to morbidity and death were reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, and upon 
administration of high carbohydrate nutritional supplements. 
Decreases in APTT and PT were observed in rats at exposure levels ≥ 0.15 the systemic exposure in 
humans at 180 mg.  The changes in coagulation parameters in the non-clinical studies were not 
consistent across species and no microscopic correlates were observed. More importantly, in clinical 
studies, APTT and PT were found not to be affected. The effects on coagulation as observed in animals, 
are therefore considered not relevant for humans. 
In the rat embryo-fetal development study, maternal toxicity was evident from the mid-dose (30 
mg/kg) on, which, according to the applicant, resulted in foetal toxicity in the form of reduced foetal 
weight and an increased number of skeletal malformations and variations. However, starting at the low 
dose (10 mg/kg), there was a statistically significant increase in bent scapula and bent ribs, without 
any evidence of maternal toxicity. These effects can be considered as skeletal retardations, associated 
with delays in ossification, and are transient and reversible after birth. 
Ezetimibe 
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of ezetimibe have been adequately 
described. However, no ERA has been submitted for ezetimibe. The present application is made 
under Art. 8(3) – full application where the full data set has to be provided, including ERA for both 
active substances. 
The argumentation for a non-increase in environmental exposure due to fixed combination was 
considered not appropriate. The product literature does not state explicitly its use as substitution for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 43/239 
 
 
 
the active substances previously given concomitantly in single products. Furthermore, an increase in 
consumption of ezetimibe is indicated for EU5 with a significant increase of 16.5% according to the 
data provided by the applicant. Thus an increase in environmental exposure can be expected indeed 
and an ERA would be necessary. It was recommended to submit the ERA for ezetimibe for assessment 
when it is completed in January 2021.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that bempedoic acid 
mediates its effects on cholesterol metabolism via ACL-dependent inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. 
From the pharmacokinetic point of view, the rats and monkeys were the most relevant species for non-
clinical efficacy and safety studies.  
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of ezetimibe have been adequately 
described. 
Overall, the nonclinical safety profile of FDC bempedoic acid/ezetimibe has been adequately 
characterized. It was recommended to submit the ERA for ezetimibe for assessment when it is 
completed in January 2021. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Study 1002FDC-053 
The FCMP Phase 3 program included 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study. Study 1002FDC-053 enrolled patients with documented ASCVD and/or HeFH and/or multiple CV 
risk factors and who required additional LDL-C lowering therapy despite already receiving maximally 
tolerated statin background therapy. 
Following database lock, a careful review of the data including PK data at the per patient level (plasma 
bempedoic concentrations and plasma ezetimibe concentrations), it became apparent that an unusual 
number of patients who reported routinely ingesting IMP had no detectable IMP in their PK blood 
samples. Subsequent investigation of this data revealed that of the 78 sites included in this study, 
most of these patients referenced above were from 3 sites.  Based on this finding, a detailed 
investigation root cause analysis (RCA) was conducted by the study Sponsor to determine the cause, 
and,  data from these sites were excluded in a post hoc sensitivity analysis. In the clinical overview, 
data from both the original and post hoc sensitivity analysis are presented. The post hoc sensitivity 
analyses with all data from these sites  removed also produced efficacy results that were statistically 
and clinically significant and generally recapitulated the safety findings of the original analysis. It is the

position of the Applicant that the post hoc sensitivity analysis most accurately reflects the efficacy and 
safety profile of the FCMP within the context of a clinical study.   
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of bempedoic acid administered once 
daily (OD) were evaluated in a comprehensive clinical pharmacology programme, which included 17 
studies (15 Phase 1 and 2 Phase 2), as well as 13 Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that assessed trough 
plasma concentrations for population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses. An overview of the clinical 
pharmacology programme is provided in Figure 2, Table 1 and Table 2. Three additional clinical 
pharmacology studies were conducted for the fixed-dose combination Table 3.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe are described in section 2.4.2.2 and in section 
2.4.2.3, respectively. The pharmacokinetic aspects of the FCMP are described in section 2.4.2.4.  
2.4.2.1.  Methodology 
Bioanalytical method 
Three bioanalytical methods were used for the quantitation of bempedoic acid (ETC-1002) and 
ESP15228 in plasma throughout the clinical development programme. Both ETC-1002 as ESP15228 
were measured in plasma using LC-MS/MS. Protein precipitation with acetonitrile or solid phase 
extraction was used to extract both analytes from plasma. The concentrations of ECT-1002-glucuronide 
have not been quantified. 
The applicant used a validated LC-MS/MS method for the analysis for Ezetimibe and Ezetimibe – 
glucuronide in plasma. Bioanalytical reports were also submitted for several drugs used in the DDI 
studies. 
Statistical analysis 
Standard pharmacokinetic parameters have been estimated using both non-compartmental methods 
and population pharmacokinetic analyses. In the statistical comparison of most studies, a mixed effects 
model was used with subject within sequence as random effect. The applicant also provided additional 
re-analysis for several bioequivalence and DDI studies using fixed-effects for sequence, subject within 
sequence, period, and formulation/treatment as a sensitivity analysis. 
Two population pharmacokinetic analyses were submitted by the applicant. The first population 
pharmacokinetic analysis characterised the pharmacokinetics of both ETC-1002 and ESP15228 in 11 
phase 1 and 2 studies. Mainly densely sampled studies were included in the analysis. The 
pharmacokinetics were best described using a 3-compartment model (central and peripheral 
compartment for the parent, and a central compartment for the metabolite). A model with parallel 
linear and non-linear formation of the metabolite was considered the base model with the lowest 
objective function value. Pre-defined covariates were fitted simultaneously with a pre-specified 
structure. Due to long runtimes, the model was reduced to a linear formation pathway of the 
metabolite. This is considered acceptable as the non-linear component appears to be primarily involved 
in the lower concentration range and not in the therapeutic exposure range. 
The second population pharmacokinetic analysis quantified the pharmacokinetics of the parent, ETC-
1002, in 22 phase 1 to 3 studies. The final popPK dataset included 2232 subjects with 10347 
quantifiable PK samples, 184 (8.2%) were healthy subjects, 1689 (75.6%) were hyperlipidemia 
patients and 359 (16%) had T2DM. Both dense and sparse sampled studies were included in the 
analysis. The pharmacokinetics of ETC-1002 were best described using a 2-compartment model 
(central and peripheral). A transit compartment was used to describe the absorption phase of

EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 49/239 
 
 
 
 
bempedoic acid. Pre-defined covariates were fitted simultaneously with a pre-specified structure. 
Backward elimination was used to reduce the model. Main covariates were body weight and renal 
function. Also, covariate effects of atorvastatin on bioavailability (12.6% increase) and simvastatin on 
V2/F (15.2% decrease) were identified.  
Also, a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was submitted based on data from 15 
phase 1 to 3 studies. This model quantified the relationship between ETC-1002 and LDL-C lowering. A 
sequential based analysis for the PK/PD modelling was intended, where the PK/PD analysis was 
conditioned upon the fitting of the PK using the individual PK parameters. An indirect response model 
describing inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, incorporating serum LDL-C turnover with inhibitory drug 
effect on the production of serum LDL-C concentration (Kin), was used (Figure 3). Concomitant 
therapy with statins or ezetimibe influenced the Imax (lower) and baseline LDL-C parameters.  
Figure 5. Indirect Response Base Model 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid 
Absorption 
Bempedoic acid has pH dependent aqueous solubility, that is low below pH 6 but increases at higher 
pH levels. Bempedoic acid is classified as a BCS class 2 compound. Bempedoic acid and its active 
metabolite were not found to be substrates for intestinal efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP in vitro.   
Bempedoic acid is absorbed with a median time to a maximum concentration of 3.5 hours when 
administered orally as 180 mg tablets. Bempedoic acid is partially converted to an active metabolite 
ESP15228, which has a median tmax of 7.0 hours. Concomitant food administration had no effect on 
the oral bioavailability of bempedoic acid, a minor influence on Cmax (-12%) and decreased the 
absorption rate constant by approximately 78%. No absolute bioavailability studies were conducted.  
After absorption, bempedoic acid is activated in the liver by ACSVL1 to ETC-1002-CoA, which 
subsequently inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxyl-
3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. 
Concomitant food administration did not affect the oral bioavailability of bempedoic acid and had a 
minor influence on Cmax. The food effect study, an FDA-defined high-fat, high-calorie breakfast, was 
given. 
Bempedoic acid clinical program included four drug formulations, bioequivalence between developed 
formulations and to-be-marketed 180 mg immediate release tablet has been established.

Steady state  
Steady state is reached in approximately 7-14 days. Steady-state bempedoic acid AUC and average 
plasma concentrations in patients from the three placebo-controlled phase 3 studies were consistent 
across bempedoic acid formulations used in phase 3 studies, with an AUCss, 0-24hours of about 
310h.µg/mL for bempedoic acid, Figure 5.  
Figure 7. Model predicted AUCss for studies 1002-046, 1002-047 and 1002-048 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution following oral administration of bempedoic acid was approximately 
16-18L. The in vitro protein binding was high ranging from 95% for ETC-1002 (parent compound) to 
99% for both ESP15228 (active metabolite) and ETC-1002-glucuronide (inactive metabolite). The 
extent of protein binding was independent of drug concentrations. The average blood: plasma ratio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 51/239 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
was found to be 0.5 indicating limited distribution to the blood cells. Plasma protein binding was 
slightly affected by the degree of renal impairment. 
Elimination 
The ADME study indicated that renal clearance is the main route of elimination of bempedoic acid 
(predominantly as glucuronide metabolites), approximately 62.1% and 25.4% of the radioactivity was 
recovered from urine and faeces respectively. Metabolism accounts for more than 95% of the 
elimination of bempedoic acid after oral administration. The primary route of elimination for bempedoic 
acid is through metabolism to the acyl glucuronide (Figure 6). Bempedoic acid is also reversibly 
converted to an active metabolite (ESP15228). Mean plasma AUC metabolite/parent drug ratio for 
ESP15228 following repeat-dose administration was 18% and remained constant over time.

ECT1002 and ESP15228 are both converted to inactive glucuronide conjugates in vitro by UGT2B7. 
After administration of a single dose of bempedoic acid ECT1002 and, ESP15228 and their respective 
conjugated forms were detected in plasma with ECT1002 accounting for the majority (46%) of the 
AUC0-48h and its glucuronide being the next most prevalent (30%). ESP15228 and its glucuronide 
represented 10% and 11% of the plasma AUC0-48h, respectively. In the ADME study, the unchanged

parent and its active metabolite could be detected in faeces but accounted for less than 2% of total 
administered radioactivity. In urine, the majority of the sample radioactivity was associated with an 
acyl glucuronide of bempedoic acid. Three additional metabolites: an acid metabolite of ETC-1002, 
mono hydroxymethyl-ESP15228, and a taurine conjugate of ETC-1002 were described in faeces. 
The apparent steady-state clearance (CL/F) of bempedoic acid was 11.2 mL/min and the mean half-life 
was 19 hours at steady-state.  The terminal half-life of ESP15228 was approximately 30 hours. In the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of ESP15228 appeared to be formation rate 
limited and best described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 
The steady state concentrations of the major inactive metabolite, ETC-1002-glucuronide, have not 
been determined yet, but will be determined post marketing, see recommendations section VII.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Bempedoic acid AUC0-24, ss and Cmax appear to increase more than proportional with increasing 
dose>120 mg to 250 mg.  
No time dependency has been observed for bempedoic acid. Accumulation ratios were approximately 2 
for ETC-1002 and approximately 3 for ESP15228.  
Inter-individual variability  
The inter-individual variability (CV%) of Cmax and AUCt values for bempedoic acid was moderate 
(30% and 33%, respectively) when 180 mg QD dosing regimen was used in healthy subjects. Similar 
inter-individual variability was reported for ESP15228 exposure parameters. Intra-individual variability 
is approximately 34%. Intra-individual variability is comparable between healthy subjects and 
patients; however inter-individual variability is higher in patients as indicated by the estimates of the 
population pharmacokinetic model 
In a popPK analysis, the inter-individual variability estimates for apparent drug clearance (CL/F), 
apparent central distribution volume (V2/F) and absorption rate constant (Ka) were 29.7%, 100.0% 
and 73.9%, respectively. 
2.4.2.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Overall, steady state PK properties of bempedoic acid 180 mg appeared to be consistent across trials in 
the patient population. Bempedoic acid trough concentrations in patients with hyperlipidemia are 
approximately 10 ug/mL after the administration of 180 mg bempedoic acid. 
2.4.2.2.2.  Special Populations 
Bempedoic acid and ESP15228 exposure as measured by AUC increased with increasing degree of 
renal impairment; Cmax (after a single dose) was not substantially affected by renal impairment. The 
same trends have been observed for the unbound fractions of ETC-1002 and ESP15228. The clearance 
of ETC-1002 and ESP15228 is decreased in patients with renal impairment. An approximately 1.4-fold 
increase in AUC for patients with mild renal impairment and 1.9-fold increase in AUC for patients with 
moderate renal impairment have been observed in population PK analysis. No studies on patients with 
ESRD or on hemodialysis were performed. 
Total bempedoic acid (ECT1002 and ESP15228) exposure was reduced by 27% and 21% in subjects 
with mild (Child-Pugh A) and moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment relative to subjects with 
normal hepatic function. This decrease is not expected to be clinically relevant, no dose adjustments 
are required for subjects with hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment was not studied. The 
lack of data in patients with severe hepatic impairment is appropriately reflected in proposed SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 53/239 
 
 
 
From the population PK model, it can be determined that patients with a lower body weight will have 
an increased exposure. This is also confirmed by the additional analysis in which the applicant 
evaluated the relationship between observed trough concentrations with bodyweight. As the difference 
was relatively small, no dose adjustments are necessary. Females had a 40% higher exposure to 
bempedoic acid. However, this is most likely caused by weight differences between both genders.  
There appears to be a trend for increasing exposure with age in the population pharmacokinetic model 
and greater variability in the black subject and a trend lower exposure in Hispanic subjects. However 
the influence of age, race and ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid should be 
interpreted with caution as there are issues with the selection of covariates in the population 
pharmacokinetic model. The influence of age race and ethnicity should, therefore, be re-evaluated 
after model refinement.

2.4.2.2.3.  Interactions 
In vitro 
Bempedoic acid inhibits renal transporter OAT3 with IC50 values of about 40µg/mL. Bempedoic acid 
also inhibited the hepatic and renal transporter OAT2, but different IC50 values were observed for 
different substrates. The estimates IC50 was 1.24 µg/mL for uric acid, 88.9µg/mL for creatinine and 
142 µg/mL for cGMP. The substrate dependency is not understood and will be further evaluated post 
marketing, see section VII.  
The IC50 bempedoic acid concentrations were 119 µg/mL for the hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and 
152 µg/mL for OATP1B3 and the Inlet Cmax(u)*25 was 48 µg/mL so weak inhibition is expected. ETC-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 54/239 
 
 
 
 
1002 glucuronide inhibits OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 at IC50 concentrations of 43 and 43 µg/mL, 
respectively. 
No significant in vitro inhibition or induction of the of Cytochrome P450 enzymes by bempedoic acid or 
its active metabolite ESP15228 was observed.  
Bempedoic acid is not an inducer of UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations, 
however some induction of UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 has been observed at supra therapeutic 
concentrations. These results are in line with the results of clinical DDI studies. 
Further, the applicant has conducted vitro study to investigate the potential interactions of the inactive 
ETC 1002-glucuronide. The interactions with Cytochrome P450 enzymes, the transporters OAT1, OAT3, 
and OCT2 and the transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, and P-glycoprotein were investigated. ETC-
1002-glucuronide was not a reversible or time dependent inhibitor in vitro of the CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A enzymes in the concentration range 
of 0 to 133 μM. No final conclusions on these studies can be drawn due to the lack of steady state 
concentration data on ETC 1002-glucuronide.  
In vivo 
The applicant conducted two drug-drug interaction studies with a statin in which the effect of steady-
state bempedoic acid 180mg (Study 1002-037) or 240 mg (study1002-012) on the single-dose plasma 
pharmacokinetics of different statins was investigated. Study subjects were included in cohorts and 
treated with different statins (12 subjects per cohort). Elevations in systemic statin exposure as 
assessed by the steady-state AUC ratio were observed for the different statins in studies 1002-037 and 
1002-012 (See table 3). In the study with the higher 240mg dose of bempedoic acid a 2-fold increase 
for pravastatin, 1.7-fold for rosuvastatin and 2-fold for simvastatin was observed. In the study with the 
180 mg bempedoic acid an increased exposure of simvastatin of 2-fold, atorvastatin of 1.4-fold (with 
increases of relevant active metabolites of 1.5- and 2.2-fold), pravastatin 1.5-fold, and rosuvastatin 
1.5-fold has been observed. Statin Cmax concentrations were also increased by a similar extent, 
suggesting that not only the excretion but also the first pass effect of statins is affected. According to 
the applicant, the interaction can probably be attributed to inhibition of OATP transport.  
Steady state concentrations of bempedoic acid were not affected by a single dose administration of any 
of the statins. The effect of steady state statin on the exposure of bempedoic acid has not been 
estimated.

The pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid was not affected in the presence of ezetimibe at steady state. 
Increases in AUC and Cmax for unconjugated ezetimibe were observed, but these increases were less 
than 20% during steady-state exposure of bempedoic acid. Total ezetimibe (ezetimibe and its 
glucuronide form) and ezetimibe glucuronide AUC and Cmax increased approximately 1.6-fold and 1.8-
fold, respectively. Due to inhibition of OATP1B1 by BA the hepatic uptake of ezetimibe-glucuronide is 
decreased and subsequently its elimination is decreased.  
The DDI study with the general UGT and OAT1/OAT3 inhibitor probenecid showed an increased 
exposure of 1.7- and 1.95-fold for ETC-1002 and ESP15228. 
Although, in vitro studies indicated that there may be a clinically relevant interaction with the OAT3 or 
OAT2 transporters, no clinical interaction studies with substrates of OAT3 or OAT2 were conducted. In 
the clinical studies, elevations of uric acid and creatinine were observed. According to the applicant, 
these elevations can possibly be attributed to inhibition of OAT2. 
The applicant proposes to further investigate the DDI liability of bempedoic acid as the precipitant of 
OAT2 interactions with clinically relevant drugs and the role of OAT2 in explaining the effects of 
bempedoic acid on creatinine and uric acid in five additional in vitro studies (see section VII) and one 
NC study. Bempedoic acid did not influence the pharmacokinetics of hormonal contraceptives and 
metformin. Also, no effect was observed on the pharmacodynamics of metformin. 
Based on popPK analysis, concomitant medications (statins, metformin, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 
inhibitors) had no significant impact on bempedoic acid PK. 
2.4.2.2.4.  Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The median maximal concentration of approximately 20 µg/mL observed after the administration of a 
180 mg dose of bempedoic acid at steady can be used for the safety evaluation. However, it should be 
taken into account that some individuals demonstrated concentrations as high as 70 µg/mL after the 
administration of 180 mg bempedoic acid at steady state. 
2.4.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics of ezetimibe 
The pharmacokinetics of ezetimibe were mainly described using literature review and have briefly been 
described below.  
After oral administration, ezetimibe was absorbed and extensively conjugated to a phenolic glucuronide 
form (ezetimibe-glucuronide) that is at least as pharmacologically active as the parent drug. Ezetimibe 
undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. Multiple peaks of unconjugated ezetimibe are observed. 
Ezetimibe-glucuronide constitutes 80-90% of plasma drug levels with unconjugated ezetimibe the 
remaining 10-20%. After a single dose of ezetimibe 10 mg in fasting adults, mean ezetimibe Cmax was 
3.4 to 5.5 ng/mL, with tmax of 4 to 12 hours, and ezetimibe-glucuronide mean Cmax was 45 to 71 
ng/mL and tmax was 1 to 2 hours. 
The in vitro human plasma protein binding ranged from 99.5% to 99.8% and 87.8% to 92.0% for 
ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide, respectively. 
Ezetimibe is metabolized primarily in the small intestine and liver via glucuronide conjugation with 
subsequent biliary and renal excretion. In vitro studies identified intestinal and hepatic contribution by 
UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT2B15 to the formation of the phenolic glucuronide. The half-life for 
ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide is approximately 22 hours.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 56/239 
 
 
 
Following oral administration of 14C-ezetimibe (20 mg) to human subjects, total ezetimibe (ezetimibe 
and ezetimibe-glucuronide) accounted for approximately 93% of the total radioactivity in plasma. 
Approximately 78% and 11% of the administered radioactivity were recovered in the feces and urine, 
respectively. 
The mean AUC for total ezetimibe after a single dose of 10 mg increased approximately 1.7-fold in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), compared with healthy subjects; and 
in a multiple-dose study in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the mean AUC values for total 
ezetimibe and ezetimibe were increased approximately 4-fold compared with healthy subjects. 
Ezetimibe is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment due to the 
unknown effects of these increases in exposure. 
No adjustment to ezetimibe dose is needed when administered as a monotherapy in patients with renal 
impairment.  
The inter-individual variability of ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide was characterized as moderate.  
with published %CV values of 49% and 53% for Cmax and AUC, respectively, in a meta-analysis across 
a wide range of studies. For variability of the FDC was moderate as well with values of Cmax (%CV 48% 
to 65%) and AUC (%CV 45% to 65%). 
Ezetimibe is reported to exhibit dose-proportional exposure for both Cmax and AUC across a dose range 
from 5 to 20 mg following a single dose and across a dose range of 10 to 50 mg following multiple 
doses. 
For the exposure relevant for safety The Cmax and AUC for ezetimibe-glucuronide and total ezetimibe 
observed in the FDC studies using a 10 mg QD ezetimibe regimen in combination with bempedoic acid 
were similar to steady-state levels in historical studies with 20 mg QD regimen of ezetimibe because of 
the known interaction between bempedoic acid and ezetimibe-glucuronide.  Published values for the 20 
mg dose for total ezetimibe Cmax and AUC are 103 ng/mL and 1314 ng·h/mL, respectively  
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacokinetics of fixed dose combination 
In study 1002FDC-034, the relative bioequivalence of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe was compared 
between the FCMP and the single components. According to the Guideline on the clinical development 
of fixed combination medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/158268/2017), demonstration of similar 
pharmacokinetics of the fixed combination medicinal product versus its individual active substances 
can be used to bridge clinical data establishing the contribution of each active substance and the 
positive risk balance. Therefore, study 1002FDC-034 is considered a pivotal study for the MAA of the 
FCMP. 
The bioequivalence results of study 1002FDC-034 are displayed below in Table 5 for bempedoic acid 
(ETC-1002) and the active metabolite (ESP15228) and in Table 6 for ezetimibe unconjugated and 
ezetimibe-glucuronide. The ANOVA analysis has been conducted on subjects with evaluable data for 
both Test and Reference product, in line with the bioequivalence guideline.

Bempedoic acid and the active metabolite are within the acceptance criteria of 80.00 – 125.00%. 
However, the AUC0-inf and Cmax of ezetimibe (unconjugated), ezetimibe-glucuronide and total ezetimibe 
are outside the acceptance criteria of 80.00-125.00%. We consider the clinical Study 1002FDC-053 as 
primary evidence. This study demonstrated a positive benefit/risk for the FDC. Therefore, we do not 
expect a clinical difference from switching from the monocomponents to the FDC. 
Study 1002FDC-055 demonstrated that for bempedoic acid mean Cmax was reduced 30% after fed 
relative to fasted administration and median tmax was delayed 2 hours. Similarly, ezetimibe mean 
AUCs were not affected by a high-fat meal; mean ezetimibe Cmax was reduced 12% and median tmax 
was prolonged 2.5 hours under fed relative to fasted conditions. For ezetimibe-glucuronide, AUCinf and 
Cmax were decreased by 12% and 42%, respectively, under fed relative to fasted conditions. 
In study 1002FDC-053, trough plasma concentrations were collected for bempedoic acid and 
ezetimibe. These concentrations were compared with the other study. After exclusion of three clinical 
sites, the trough concentrations appeared to be similar for bempedoic acid between studies. Mean 
trough concentrations for ezetimibe-glucuronide were higher with administration of the FCMP (85.2 to 
109 ng/mL) than when ezetimibe was administered as monotherapy (49.2 to 52.8 ng/mL). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Bempedoic Acid Mechanism of Action 
In the liver, bempedoic acid is activated to ETC-1002-Coenzyme A (ETC-1002-CoA), which 
subsequently inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxyl-
3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Inhibition of 
cholesterol synthesis triggers the upregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) 
expression in the liver resulting in increased clearance of LDL particles and lowering of LDL-C in the 
blood.   
Bempedoic acid requires coenzyme A (CoA) activation by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 
(ACSVL1) to ETC-1002-CoA (Pinkosky et al, 2016).  Inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in 
decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver and lowers LDL-C in blood via upregulation LDL-Rs ( Figure 
8).  ETC-1002-CoA (via ACL inhibition) and statins (via HMG-CoA reductase inhibition) both inhibit 
cholesterol synthesis in the liver; however, bempedoic acid is inactive in skeletal muscle.  Additionally, 
inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in concomitant suppression of hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis 
and it is this aspect of activity that is thought to lead to improvements in glycemic control in 
hyperglycemic animal models.

Figure 10. Mechanism of Action bempedoic acid 
Schematic overview of the mechanism of action of bempedoic acid (ETC-1002). (1) Bempedoic acid is 
converted to ETC-1002-Coenzyme A (ETC-1002-CoA) in the liver and (2) inhibits ATP citrate lyase 
(ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase in the 
cholesterol synthesis pathway.  Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis (3) reduces intracellular cholesterol 
levels, which (4) triggers the upregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity in the liver 
resulting in (5) increased clearance of LDL particles and reduced LDL-C in the blood.  
Ezetimibe Mechanism of Action 
The molecular target of ezetimibe inhibits the absorption of cholesterol by inhibition of the Niemann-
Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) receptor leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the 
liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in LDL receptors, resulting 
in clearance of cholesterol from the blood. This distinct mechanism is complementary to that of 
bempedoic acid.   
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Bempedoic Acid PD effect 
The mechanism of action could not be formally tested in any clinical setting, only the eventual PD 
result in terms of LDL-C could be demonstrated.  
Phase 1 PK/PD studies 
Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ascending multiple-dose studies evaluated fasting 
lipid parameters in healthy subjects. Subjects (n=53) received bempedoic acid 20, 60, 100, or 120 mg 
or placebo QD in a 3:1 ratio (Study 1002-002, Cohorts 1-4); or (n=24) bempedoic acid 140, 180, 200 
mg, or placebo (Study 1002-004) QD for 14 days.  In both studies, blood samples for fasting lipids 
(calculated LDL-C, TC, HDL-C, and TGs) were collected predose and on Day 1, 4, 8, and 15.   
Percent change from baseline to Day 15 in calculated LDL-C is illustrated in Figure 9 and Table 7 
below. LDL-cholesterol lowering was evident starting at Day 4 and near maximum LDL-C lowering 
appear to have been achieved by Day 15.

Interaction with PCSK9 inhibitors 
Phase 2 Study 1002-039 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to 
assess 2-month efficacy of bempedoic acid 180 mg/day vs placebo in the reduction of LDL-C in 
patients onto (PCSK9i) therapy (evolocumab). Following a washout period of all LMT, patients received 
run-in treatment with evolocumab for 3 months, after which they were randomized 1:1 to add on

bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo QD for 2 months. Basic fasting lipids, apo B, hsCRP, and trough 
plasma concentrations of ETC-1002 (parent compound) and ESP15228 (active metabolite) were 
assessed at baseline, Month 1, and Month 2.   
An additive reduction in LDL-C was observed when bempedoic acid was added to evolocumab, with a 
LS mean change from baseline of -27.5% compared with 2.8% in the placebo + evolocumab group; 
the LS mean difference from placebo (-30.3%) was statistically significant (p <0.001), Figure 10.

Secondary pharmacology: QT prolongation 
A thorough QT study was performed to assess the potential effects of bempedoic acid on the QT 
interval. Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of the following oral QD treatments on 
Days 1 through 9: (A) bempedoic acid 240 mg + matched to moxifloxacin placebo; (B) matched to 
bempedoic acid placebo + 1 matched to moxifloxacin placebo; or (C) moxifloxacin 400 mg and 
matched to bempedoic acid placebo.  
Based on the unadjusted and mixed-effects regression models using both time-matched and predose 
baselines, bempedoic acid did not affect QTcF. The expected extent and pattern of change in QTcF 
during moxifloxacin treatment was observed, with statistically significant elevations in time-matched, 
placebo- and baseline-adjusted QTcF (ddQTcF) from 1 to 16 hours postdose on Day 9, Figure 11.    
The QTcF interval did not exceed 450 msec at any time point in the bempedoic acid group and change 
from baseline in QTcF did not exceed 30 msec in any bempedoic acid-treated subject. There were no 
clinically significant changes in heart rate, PR interval, or QRS duration in subjects who received 
bempedoic acid.

Ezetimibe PD effect 
Evidence of effectiveness of ezetimibe as a single-agent product comes from previous findings of 
efficacy for ezetimibe, including published information on ezetimibe available in the scientific literature 
(Ezetrol SmPC, 2018; Zetia USPI, 2013). 
Bempedoic Acid with Ezetimibe PD effects 
The PD effects of the FCMP are discussed in the efficacy section. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In general, the pharmacokinetics were adequately characterised in the clinical pharmacology 
programme of bempedoic acid. The pharmacokinetics of ezetimibe were characterised in the FDC 
studies and summarised based on literature review. 
Bempedoic acid 
The submitted bioanalytical methods are validated and in general suitable for the analysis of ETC-1002 
and the active metabolite ESP15228 in plasma, ultrafiltrate and urine. ETC-1002-glucuronide, the main 
metabolite (21-36% in plasma), was not analysed in the clinical development programme of 
bempedoic acid.  The company committed to measure steady state concentrations of ETC-1002-
glucuronide to enable correct interpretation of the in vitro interaction studies.  
The bioanalytical methods for ezetimibe are validated and generally acceptable for the analysis of 
ezetimibe in plasma. The analytical methods for the drugs used in the DDI studies were appropriately 
validated.  
In the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models, some issues 
needed to be clarified during the procedure but the clarifications were accepted by the CHMP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020

For all models developed by the applicant, covariates were fit simultaneously with a pre-defined 
structure but without a formal covariate step (e.g. backwards elimination). Additional analyses were 
conducted by the applicant using a more formal covariate step (e.g. backwards elimination, forward-
selection procedure). There appears to be misspecification present in the VPC, mainly in the early time 
course of the trials. Therefore, the model predicted influence of the covariates should be interpreted 
with care. The model is not fit for extrapolation. 
With respect to the population PK/PD model, individual ETAs for CL, V2 and KA were used for the 
prediction of exposure. It was unclear how the PK model, which is mainly fixed due to the sequential 
approach, influences the PD model. On top of that, the applicant stated that the structural PK model 
from the second population pharmacokinetic analysis was used in the PK/PD analysis. However, the 
PK/PD model included estimates (K25 and K52) for a third compartment from a model that was not 
submitted. The applicant was asked to submit the report of the PK model used in PK-PD analysis 
including model development, GOF plots, VPCs, parameter estimates and model code to allow correct 
interpretation of the PK/PD model. The applicant submitted the requested information and conducted 
an additional sensitivity analysis, in which the PK/PD model was estimated using different PK model 
structures. The results indicated that the different structural model of the PK model only demonstrated 
a minimal influence on the parameter estimates. Therefore, this issue was sufficiently addressed. From 
the provided goodness-of-fit plots, there remain signs of structural model misspecification as most of 
the variability seems to be solved using interindividual random effects (IPRED vs DV and PRED vs DV 
plots, see population PK/PD report). The applicant performed additional outlier analysis (n = 37), 
however these outliers were not expected to influence the model structure.  
This population PK/PD model has been used to justify that statin use was a significant covariate on 
bempedoic acid maximum inhibitory effect (Imax) and was associated with a reduction of LDL-C 
lowering when bempedoic acid was added to a stable statin regimen.  The magnitude of the effect on 
Imax was dependent on statin-intensity, ie, higher statin intensities decreased the bempedoic acid 
Imax on LDL-C.  Low-, moderate- and high-intensity statins were predicted to result in a typical 
maximum LDL-C lowering of -25%, -23% and -19%, respectively. The population PK/PD model cannot 
adequately describe the structural trends after inclusion of significant covariates. However, the DDI 
studies with statins demonstrated a similar trend as the population PK/PD, although the magnitude 
of the effects are slightly different. The DDI studies showed that a higher statin dose resulted in a 
lower LDL reduction by bempedoic acid. Therefore, the DDI studies are considered pivotal in this 
argumentation. Bempedoic acid peak plasma concentration are observed after 3.5 hours when 
administered as 180 mg tablets. Median tmax for the active metabolite ESP15228 was 7 hours. 
Bempedoic acid is extensively metabolised, to mainly to glucuronide conjugates. No pharmacokinetic 
profile of bempedoic acid-glucuronide, the most predominant metabolite, has been submitted.  
The aqueous solubility of bempedoic acid is pH dependent - being low below pH 6 but increasing at 
higher pH levels. Although bempedoic acid exhibits pH-dependent solubility in vitro, the high oral 
absorption in vivo (of approximately 90%) and a lack of food effect support it can be assumed that 
impact of increasing pH induced by co-administrated medicinal products is not expected to have an 
effect on bempedoic acid absorption. 
In patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, bempedoic acid exposure increases by 2-
fold. At this stage as the exposure-response relationship of bempedoic acid has only been determined 
for LDL-C and no clear influence on other markers and safety parameters. The applicant discussed the 
mechanisms involved in the impaired elimination of bempedoic acid in patients with renal impairment. 
Possible explanations are a reduced activity of UGT2B7 or a possible higher contribution of 
enterohepatic cycling of the ETC-1002-glucuronide metabolite. These mechanisms still need to be 
confirmed.  No studies on patients with ESRD/on hemodialysis were performed. Lack of data on these 
patient’s groups is reflected in proposed SmPC. The slightly higher exposure for renally excreted drug 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020

in >75yrs patients compared to the patients < 65yrs is expected due to the well-described relationship 
between age and renal function. 
Bempedoic acid mainly undergoes direct glucuronidation via UGTs and is not metabolised by CYP450 
enzymes. Glucuronidation by UGT2B7 is the main route of elimination of bempedoic acid and 
ESP15228. As UGT2B7 is considered to be a highly polymorphic gene, no clear effects on clearance are 
however observed as indicated by the distribution of CL/F in the population pharmacokinetic model. 
In vitro studies indicated that bempedoic acid and its active metabolite ESP15228 do not inhibit 
CYP450 enzymes and has minimal potential to induce CYP450 enzymes at clinically relevant 
concentrations.  
Elevations of in systemic statin exposure as assessed by the steady-state AUC ratio were 
observed for the different statins in two drug-drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers in which 
the effect of steady state bempedoic acid 180mg (Study 1002-037) or 240 mg (study1002-012) on the 
single-dose plasma pharmacokinetics of different statins was investigated. An increase of 1.5- to 2- 
fold for pravastatin, 1.5- to 1.7- fold for rosuvastatin, 1.4-fold for atorvastatin (with increases of 
relevant active metabolites of 1.5- and 2.2-fold increase) and 2-fold for simvastatin was observed. 
These studies are in line with the requirements of the EMA Guideline on the investigation of drug 
interactions [CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**] and would generally be acceptable as this 
approximately reflects the steady state interaction in clinical situations. The pharmacokinetic 
interaction between statins and bempedoic acid is probably caused by OATP1B1 inhibition. In in vitro 
studies, bempedoic acid and its glucuronide weakly inhibited OATP1B1 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. OATP1B1 is an uptake transporter expressed on the hepatocytes and involved in the 
hepatic uptake of statins. The hepatocyte is the site of action of statins and statins are metabolised in 
the hepatocyte. Due to a high first-pass effect (the absolute bioavailability is 5% for simvastatin, 12% 
for atorvastatin 17% for pravastatin and 20% for rosuvastatin) and efficient first uptake into the 
hepatocyte OATP inhibition may not only impact the systemic absolute bioavailability but also the 
pharmacodynamics of statins. OATP is not expressed in myocyte and therefore not involved in the 
uptake of statins into the myocyte. As the impact of the interaction with bempedoic acid appears to be 
dose dependent (a higher increase of rosuvastatin and pravastatin exposure was observed with the 
higher dose of bempedoic acid) the impact may potentially be higher in patients with a higher 
bempedoic acid exposure (e.g. patients with renal impairment).  
In clinical studies, the total LDL-C reduction was a combined effect of statin and bempedoic acid. 
As both active substances act on the same pathway the contribution of the individual active substances 
to the lipid lowering effect cannot be measured accurately but has been estimated via modeling. These 
estimations should be interpreted with caution as dose-exposure-response relationships is not 
proportional, linear and similar for each statin. The observed interaction between bempedoic acid and 
statins may also contribute to tolerability issues observed.  
The combined administration of ezetimibe and bempedoic acid resulted in an increase in 
exposure of 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold for total ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide, respectively. Some 
difference in efficacy is noticed in the subgroup analyses in the clinical studies, but the interaction was 
not significant (see clinical efficacy section). Further, it is known that the dose response relationship of 
ezetimibe is rather flat. The impact on clinical safety limited, no dose dependent safety issues are 
known for ezetimibe within the clinical dose range and no notable differences in adverse events profile 
could be identified between patients concomitantly treated with or without ezetimibe.  
In in vitro studies bempedoic acid inhibits renal transporter OAT3 with IC50 values of about 40µg/mL 
In vitro data predict a weak inhibition of OAT3 and also by the limited impact of bempedoic acid on the 
pharmacokinetics of the OAT3-OATP1B1 substrate pravastatine. In DDI study 1002-037, a 1.46 fold 
increase of pravastatin exposure has been observed when coadministered with 180mg bempedoic acid

and up to 2 fold increase with the supra therapeutic 240mg dose. Potential interaction mechanisms 
include interaction with hepatic uptake (via OATP1B1) and renal elimination (via OAT3) of pravastatin. 
Bempedoic acid has a combined effect on both mechanisms but the impact is limited.  
Bempedoic acid also inhibited the hepatic and renal transporter OAT2, but different IC50 values were 
observed for different substrates. The estimates IC50 was 1.24 µg/mL for uric acid, 88.9µg/mL for 
creatinine and 142 µg/mL for cGMP. The substrate dependency is not understood. The applicant 
committed to further investigate the role of OAT2 inhibition by bempedoic acid in five in vitro studies 
and one animal model to elucidate the role of OAT2 in explaining the effects on creatinine and uric acid 
and potential interactions with other substrates of OAT2. The NC animal study is not to be considered 
of sufficient value with regard to the translation to humans, therefore the conduction of this study is 
not recommended. The company proposed to investigate different types of OAT2 expressing in vitro 
systems (MDCK-II and liver), different endogenous and drug substrates, and time and dose dependent 
inhibition. The proposed interaction program is expected to contribute to greater understanding of any 
potential clinical role of OAT2 inhibition by bempedoic acid in the disposition of endogenous and 
administered substrates. As the observed increases of uric acid and creatinine were mild and reversible 
within 4 weeks, it was agreed that the role of OAT2 inhibition is elucidated post registration.   
The applicant proposed to use PBPK to investigate inhibition of OAT2 and OATP1B1. Caution is 
recommended on the use of PBPK, given the acknowledged lack of data and hence uncertainties in the 
model, it should not be used in place of clinical data. However, it is accepted that a model may assist 
with the understanding of the interplay between transporters. Category 3 studies investigating OAT2 
inhibition were added to the agreed version of the RMP.  
Ezetimibe  
The pharmacokinetics of ezetimibe is well known and were adequately summarised by the applicant.  
FCMP 
The demonstration of bioequivalence is necessary to bridge the benefit-risk balance of the individual 
components of both bempedoic acid and ezetimibe to the FCMP. In the pivotal study 1002FDC-034, 
bioequivalence between the FCMP and the mono components bempedoic acid and ezetimibe could not 
be demonstrated for ezetimibe. However, the clinical study 1002FDC-053 was considered as primary 
evidence. This study demonstrated a positive benefit/risk for the FDC. Therefore, it was agreed a 
clinical difference is not expected when switching from the monocomponents to the FDC.  
Exposure of ezetimibe increased after the coadministration with the OATP1B1 inhibitor bempedoic acid. 
It is known that the dose response relationship of ezetimibe is rather flat and the impact on clinical 
safety is limited as no dose dependent safety issues are known for ezetimibe within the clinical dose 
range and no notable differences in adverse events profile could be identified between patients 
concomitantly treated with or without ezetimibe. Therefore the FDC can be administered safely. 
In the food effect study, the AUCinf and Cmax of ezetimibe-glucuronide decreased 12% and 42%, 
respectively, under fed relative to fasted conditions. These changes were not considered to significantly 
impact the safety and efficacy of the FCMP. Therefore, the FCMP can be administered irrespective of 
food intake.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Bempedoic acid 
Regarding the mechanism of action for bempedoic acid it appears that bempedoic acid inhibits 
adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl 
Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway to inhibit cholesterol synthesis

in the liver which triggers upregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) expression in 
the liver thereby increasing LDL-C uptake and reducing LDL-C in the blood. This specific mechanism 
could not be formally tested in any clinical setting, only the eventual PD result in terms of LDL-C could 
be demonstrated. However, some support comes from Mendelian randomised studies showing that 
absence of ACL gene expression results in the lowering of LDL-C. The PD marker of LDL-C lipid-
lowering effect was demonstrated in several phase I studies in healthy volunteers, several phase 2 
studies in a diseased population (see also efficacy section) and confirmed in several phase 3 studies 
(as discussed in the efficacy section). Two small short-term (15 days) phase I randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study in healthy subjects tested the LDL-C lowering effect of 
bempedoic acid in a dose range of 20 mg to 220 mg in small cohorts of 6 subjects each. Dose-
dependent reduction was observed from a 60 mg QD dose or higher and started at 4 days after start of 
treatment with maximum effect achieved after 15 days at the end of the study. No consistent patterns 
could be observed for other lipid parameters including TC, HDL-C and TG. The phase 2 studies (and 
phase 3 studies) provide further support for the primary PD effect as described in the efficacy section. 
In vitro hERG data and nonclinical safety pharmacology studies indicate an absence of effect 
potential QTc prolongation. Further evaluation of a potential pro-arrhythmic effect was performed 
by a thorough QT study. A slightly higher dose than the intended to be registered dose (240 mg vs 180 
mg) was investigated and compared to the positive moxifloxacin control. No indication for a QT 
prolonging effect of bempedoic acid was observed after multiple dosing with the 240 mg dose. These 
data do not raise any need for closer QT observation during the phase 3 studies. 
The effect of PK/PD in renal impairment was studied by a PK/PD model. The PK/PD model suggests an 
absence of a significant effect of renal impairment on the bempedoic acid LDL-C lowering effect. This is 
in line with the observation in the clinical studies. 
The effect of statins on the PD treatment effect of bempedoic acid has been explored using a PK/PD 
model. The model used the data from 3 phase 3 studies (studies 040, 047 (high risk, long term pool) 
and 046). It appeared that the model slightly overestimated the LDL-C lowering effect and thus may 
not exactly fit the observed effect. Bempedoic acid has an incremental effect on LDL-C reduction when 
added onto statin therapy. In the exposure-LDL-C response modelling, the additive LDL C lowering by 
bempedoic acid decreased with increasing statin dose. This is in line with the subgroup analyses in the 
clinical studies demonstrating the lowest effect with the highest statin intensity. 
Further, one study specifically evaluated the PK and PD effect of bempedoic acid added to PCSK9 
treatment (evolocumab). Both products have a different mode of action. Bempedoic acid showed an 
additional significant LDL-C lowering effect on top of PCSK9 treatment of -30.3% after 2 months of 
treatment, which thus appears even slightly greater than the LDL-C lowering effect of bempedoic acid 
monotherapy. 
As may be expected, no interaction was observed when metformin was co-administered with steady 
state bempedoic acid for lipid levels and postprandial and fasting glucose. 
The PD marker of LDL-C lipid-lowering effect was sufficiently demonstrated in several short term 15 
days phase I studies in healthy volunteers, several phase 2 studies (6 to 12 weeks) in a diseased 
population, and confirmed in several phase 3 studies. 
Specific evaluation of the QT effect has been explored in a thorough QT study (in addition to non-
clinical evaluation) and did not suggest any pro-arrhythmic effect of bempedoic acid. For ezetimibe this 
has not been specifically investigated, although there is sufficient experience with ezetimibe in clinical 
practice to conclude that no specific effect is identified, and QT prolongation has not been identified as 
an adverse drug reaction.

Ezitimibe 
Ezetimibe inhibits the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine by inhibition of the Niemann-Pick 
C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) sterol transporter, as described. 
FCMP 
There is sufficient rationale to combine bempedoic acid with ezetimibe as both products have a distinct 
but complementary mechanism of action. Bempedoic acid is an ACL inhibitor that lowers LDL-C by 
inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver, while ezetimibe inhibits the absorption of cholesterol in 
the small intestine by inhibition of the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) sterol transporter. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Bempedoic acid 
In general, the pharmacokinetics of bempedoic acid have been adequately characterised.  
A pharmacokinetic interaction between bempedoic acid and statins has been observed. The impact of 
this increased exposure of statins on the increased LDL-C lowering is not exactly clear as this has not 
been clinically tested, although subgroup analyses and additional modelling of the clinical data suggest 
that the relative contribution of bempedoic acid to the overall LDL lowering effect is highest with lower 
statin doses (see clinical efficacy and clinical safety section).  
The mechanism behind the increase in ezetimibe, uric acid, and creatinine are currently not well 
established and will be further investigated post marketing as reflected in agreed RMP. 
The potential interactions of the major inactive metabolite ECT-1002-glucuronide is not exactly clear as 
its steady state concentrations are unknown. The applicant committed to measure steady-state 
concentrations of ETC-1002-glucuronide to evaluate the interaction potential of ETC-1002-glucuronide 
post-authorisation. 
The mode of action of bempedoic acid is reasonably well established. Lowering of the LDL-C has been 
demonstrated. Further, no interaction exists with PCSK9 inhibitors or metformin. There is no sign of a 
pro-arrhythmic effect. The LDL-C effect has been further explored with a PK/PD model. 
Ezetimibe 
The PK and PD effects of ezetimibe have adequately been summarised.  
FCMP 
Bioequivalence between the FCMP and the monocomponents has only been demonstrated for 
bempedoic acid. Although the pharmacokinetic parameters of ezetimibe are currently outside the 
80.00-125.00% bioequivalence acceptance criteria, the FDC can be accepted as the pivotal clinical 
study 1002FDC-053 is considered as primary evidence. This study demonstrated a positive benefit/risk 
for the FDC.  
Exposure of ezetimibe increased approximately 2- fold after the coadministration with the OATP1B1 
inhibitor bempedoic acid, however, as it has been shown that the FCMP can be administered safely this 
increase is considered acceptable. 
From a pharmacodynamic point of view, the mode of action of bempedoic acid has reasonably well 
established. LDL-C lowering has been demonstrated. There is no sign of any proarrhythmic effect for 
both products.

A pooled analysis of 6 phase 2 studies in 832 patients (580 on bemepdoic) demonstrated a dose 
dependent effect up to 180 mg QD dose; see Table 9 below. Higher doses than the 180 mg QD dose 
did not provide an additional lipid lowering effect versus placebo. Also, on top of statins, the 180 mg 
dose provided the largest effect (-21.7%) with no additional effect with the 240 mg dose (-21.7%). Of 
note, the (additional) effect of bempedoic acid on top of statin was lower than compared to the 
bempedoic effect without statin background therapy. The effect of bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe 
versus placebo showed the largest treatment effect (-45.6% BA 120 mg + 10 mg eze, -50.1% BA 180 
mg +10 mg.

2.5.2.  Main clinical studies of bempedoic acid 
There are 4 phase 3 main studies that provided evidence of the effectiveness of bempedoic acid as 
monocomponent. These included two studies on top of maximum tolerated statins (studies 1002-040 
and 1002-047) and two studies in statin intolerant patients (none or low dose statin)(studies 1002-046

These studies are discussed below. 
Methods 
All phase 3 studies were double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (2:1), parallel-group, 
multicenter studies with bempedoic acid 180 mg per day or placebo in adult patients at risk for CV 
events with primary hyperlipidemia. 
Studies on top of maximum tolerated statins 
The largest study 040 used a 2 week screening period before randomsiation. Patients who met all 
enrollment criteria were instructed to continue their therapy(s) for lipid regulation and to maintain 
consistent diet and exercise patterns throughout the study. Other lipid lowering medication was 
allowed after 24 weeks of treatment. 
In study 047 patients were screened about 5 weeks before randomization. The 1-week screening could 
have been extended for an additional 4 weeks if needed, to adjust background medical therapy or for 
other reasons A single-blind placebo run-in period was used. Patients who met all enrollment criteria 
continued their allowed stable background LMT and maintained consistent diet and exercise patterns 
throughout the study. 
Studies in statin intolerant patients 
In study 046 patients were screened about 5 weeks before randomization. The 1-week screening could 
have been extended for an additional 4 weeks if needed, to adjust background medical therapy or for

other reasons A single-blind placebo run-in period was used. Patients who met all enrollment criteria 
continued their allowed stable background LMT and maintained consistent diet and exercise patterns 
throughout the study. 
In study 048 patients were screened about 5 weeks before randomization. The 1-week screening could 
have been extended for an additional 4 weeks if needed, to adjust background medical therapy or for 
other reasons. Eligible patients began the single-blind, placebo run-in period with study-supplied and 
labeled ezetimibe and placebo 4 weeks prior to randomisation. If a patient was already taking 
ezetimibe, they stopped taking their personal supply of ezetimibe and began taking study-supplied 
ezetimibe. The effect was evaluated prior to randomization. 
Lipid sample collection  
In the Phase 3 studies, samples were collected and analyzed for basic fasting lipids (calculated LDL-C, 
HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, and TGs), apo B and hsCRP at a central clinical laboratory in each study.  
Blood draws for lipids were required to be taken after a minimum 10-hour fast (water was allowed).  
LDL-C was calculated, or if TGs were > 400 mg/dL or LDL-C was < 50 mg/dL, LDL-C was measured 
directly. 
Data monitoring and CV events adjudication 
An unblinded independent data monitoring committee monitored accumulating patient safety and 
efficacy data until the last patient completed study treatment. A blinded independent expert Clinical 
Events Committee (CEC) adjudicated clinical endpoints including CV events.

CV risk definition 
High risk was defined as a diagnosis of HeFH or ASCVD (with established CHD or CHD risk 
equivalents).  Established CHD included 1 or more of either MI, silent MI, unstable angina, coronary 
revascularization procedure, or clinically significant CHD diagnosed by invasive or non-invasive testing.  
Risk of CHD included 1 or more of either peripheral arterial disease, previous ischemic stroke with a 
focal ischemic neurological deficit that persisted ≥ 24 hours.  Diagnosis of HeFH must have been made 
by either genotyping or by clinical assessment using either the World Health Organization (WHO) 
criteria/Dutch Lipid Clinical Network Criteria with a score that was > 8 points or the Simon Broome 
Register Diagnostic Criteria with an assessment of Definite HeFH. 
Maximum tolerated statin therapy 
Maximally tolerated statin use needed to be at stable doses for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. 
Maximally tolerated statin included statin regimens other than daily dosing, including no to very low 
doses, with documented reasons for not using high-intensity statin dosing.  Gemfibrozil was prohibited 
in patients taking a statin.  
Statin intolerance 
Statin intolerance defined in Study 1002-046 as inability to tolerate 2 or more statins, one at a low 
dose, due to an adverse safety effect that started or increased during statin therapy and resolved or 
improved when statin therapy was discontinued and in Study 1002-048 as inability to tolerate 1 or 
more statins. 
Relevant other exclusion criteria 
Liver disease or dysfunction, ALT/AST ≥2 × ULN, bilirubin ≥1.2 × ULN; creatine kinase (CK) >3 × 
ULN, and within 3 months CV disease or intervention.

1 Statins were allowed at specific doses in Study 1002-046 and Study 1002-048.  In Studies 1002-046 and 1002-
048, very low-dose statin therapy was allowed defined as an average daily dose of rosuvastatin < 5 mg, 
atorvastatin < 10 mg, simvastatin < 10 mg, lovastatin < 20 mg, pravastatin < 40 mg, fluvastatin < 40 mg, or 
pitavastatin < 2 mg.  In Study 1002-048, low-dose statin therapy was also allowed defined as an average daily 
dose of rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 
40 mg, or pitavastatin 2 mg. At average daily doses < 40 mg 
2 At average daily doses ≤ 40 mg prior to Amendment 5 and < 40 mg after Amendment 5. 
3 Patients who were already receiving ezetimibe were switched to study supplied ezetimibe at the time of the run-in 
period.  LDL C after the ezetimibe run-in period had to be ≥ 70 mg/dL.  
4 Gemfibrozil was excluded in patients on a statin per statin Rx.  All others allowed but required to be stable for at 
least 6 weeks prior to screening.  
5 Prohibited within 4 weeks prior to screening, but allowed as adjunctive therapy starting at Week 24. 
Statin therapy 
Baseline statin intensity (high intensity statin, moderate intensity statin, low intensity was determined 
for each patient based on the patient’s average daily dose at baseline. 
High-dose statin was defined as rosuvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, or simvastatin 40 or 80 mg 
per day.  With the implementation of Amendment 5 in study 040, simvastatin at doses ≥ 40 mg/day, 
including simvastatin-containing therapies, was prohibited, due to a bempedoic induced increase of 
exposure of simvastatin considered to be  of clinical relevance; at the time of the amendment, 98 
patients were receiving daily doses of simvastatin of ≥ 40 mg and were discontinued for this reason.  
Gemfibrozil was prohibited during the study. 
 Low-dose statin was defined as an average daily dose of rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, 
simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg, or pitavastatin 2 mg.  
Very low dose statin therapy was defined as an average daily dose of rosuvastatin < 5 mg,

a  Simvastatin doses ≥ 40 mg/day were prohibited. 
b  Low intensity statins also included those patients taking low-dose statins using an alternate regimen (ie, every 
other day, or for a specified number of times per week) and in Study 1002-047, those unable to tolerate a statin 
at any dose. 
Objectives 
Study 1002-040: To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid versus placebo in 
patients with hyperlipidemia (with underlying heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH] 
and/or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD]) who were at high risk for a CV event and who 
had elevated LDL-C, despite receiving treatment with maximally-tolerated statin therapy with and 
without other LMT.  
Study 1002-047: To assess the 12-week efficacy of bempedoic acid 180 mg versus placebo in 
decreasing LDL-C in high CV risk patients with hyperlipidemia (with atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease [ASCVD] and/or underlying heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) who are not 
adequately controlled with their maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy, defined as maximally-
tolerated statin therapy with and without other LMT. 
Study 1002-046: to assess the 12-week efficacy of bempedoic acid 180 mg/day vs placebo in 
decreasing LDL-C in patients with elevated LDL-C who are statin intolerant. 
Study 1002-048: To assess the 12-week efficacy of bempedoic acid 180 mg/day vs placebo in 
decreasing LDL-C when added to ezetimibe therapy in patients with elevated LDL-C.

Primary endpoint was safety in Study 1002-040; however, percent change from 
i 
baseline to Week 12 in LDL-C was the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Sample size 
A total of 1950 patients were planned to be enrolled in study 1002-040. The sample size was selected 
to determine the absolute risk with at least 95% power to detect adverse events that occur at rates 
similar to those seen in the placebo group for AESIs in the recently completed long-term safety study 
in the PCSK9i, alirocumab (Robinson et al, 2015). 
In study 1002-046 (n=300), study 1002-047 (n=750) and study 1002-048 (n=225), the sample size 
was determined to provide more than 95% power to detect a difference of 15% in the percent change 
from baseline to Week 12 in calculated LDL-C between the bempedoic acid treatment group and the 
placebo group. This calculation was based on a 2-sided t-test at the 5% level of significance and a 
common standard deviation of 15%. 
and a common standard deviation of 15%. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to bempedoic acid or matching placebo using an interactive web 
response system (IWRS). For studies on top of statins, randomization was stratified by CV risk 
(whether the patient had a diagnosis of HeFH) and baseline statin intensity. 
In all studies, study medication was administered in a double-blind fashion. The Sponsor, all clinical 
site personnel (eg, investigator, pharmacist), other vendor personnel, and patients were blinded to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 85/239 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment group for each patient. Patients were also blinded to the treatment they received. Unblinded 
user(s) were designated for each clinical site and at the Sponsor (or designee) as needed to perform 
emergency unblinding of treatment for an individual patient e.g. in case the safety of the patient might 
have been at risk.  
Post-randomization values for LDL-C, TGs, TC, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo B, and hsCRP, including any 
plasma concentration of the bempedoic acid analyte (ETC-1002) and its metabolite (ESP15228), were 
not available to personnel from the clinical site, the patient, the Sponsor, or CRO. 
Statistical methods 
The following populations were defined for analysis purposes (Table 15): 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS), also known as the intention-to-treat set, was used for all of the efficacy 
analyses and was defined as all randomized patients. Patients in the FAS were included in their 
randomized treatment group, regardless of their actual treatment. 
• The Safety Analysis Set, used for all of the safety summaries, was defined as all randomized patients 
who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Patients in the Safety Analysis Set were included in 
the treatment group that they actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment. 
• The PK analysis set included all patients in the Safety Analysis Set who had at least one PK 
assessment. These patients were included in plasma concentration summaries unless major protocol 
deviations identified during the protocol deviation review or if key dosing or sampling information was 
missing. 
• In studies 046 and 048, a completer Analysis Set, used as a sensitivity analysis for the primary and 
secondary efficacy analyses, was defined as all patients in the FAS who completed both IMP and 
ezetimibe treatment per the end of treatment CRF page and had non-missing Week 12 LDL-C values.

Study 048: 269 patients enrolled and randomized, 268 patients treated.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
In patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy reduction from baseline in LDL-C at week 12 for 
bempedoic acid compared with placebo was -15.1% vs 2.4%, respectively, in Study 1002-047 
and -16.5% vs -1.6%, respectively, in Study 1002-040.   
In the statin intolerant studies, reduction from baseline in LDL-C for bempedoic acid versus placebo 
was -22.6% vs -1.2%, respectively in Study 1002-046 and –23.5% vs 5.0%, respectively in 
Study 1002-048.   
Secondary endpoints 
For LDL-C at Week 24, difference between bempedoic acid and placebo was -14.8% for 
Study 1002-047, -16.1% for Study 1002-040, and -18.9% for Study 1002-046. 
For non-HDL-C at week 12, this was -13.0% for Study 1002-047, -13.3% for Study 1002-040, -17.9% 
for Study 1002-046, and -23.6% in Study 1002-048. 
For TC at week 12, this was -11.2% for Study 1002-047, -11.1% for Study 1002-040, and -14.8% for 
Study 1002-046, and -15.1% in Study 1002-048. 
For Apo B at week 12, this was -13.0% for Study 1002-047, -11.9% for Study 1002-040, and -15.0% 
for Study 1002-046, and -19.3% in Study 1002-048. 
For hsCRP at week 12, median percent change from baseline was -18.7% and -9.4% for 
Study 1002-047, -22.4% and 2.6% for Study 1002-040, -25.4% and 2.7% for Study 1002-046, and -
32.5 and 2.1% in Study 1002-048.

Changes were made to the background therapy after week 24 as indicated below. Background LLT 
therapy was slightly less intensified the bempedoic acid treatment arm than in the placebo arm (8.8% 
vs 10.1%; n= 278). This was mainly adjunctive therapy of statins (7.0% vs 8.0%), while evolocumab 
and alirocumab use was very limited (5 (0.2%) vs 4 (0.4%) and 3 (0.4%) vs 1 (0.1%)).

Phase 3 open label ongoing extension study (study 1002-050) 
In the ongoing phase 3 open label study 050 the results are displayed in Table 23 below (as of 
28 September 2018). Efficacy was assessed as a secondary objective.  Patients who received either 
bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo daily for the duration of Study 1002-040 receive bempedoic acid 
180 mg daily in the OLE Study 1002-050 for 78 weeks followed by a 4-week follow-up period off study 
drug.  For patients randomized to bempedoic acid 180 mg in the parent study 1002-040, total patient 
exposures from the combined treatment in Study 1002-040 and Study 1002-050 are up to 2.5 years. 
To maintain the integrity of the parent study, which was ongoing at the time enrollment into 
Study 1002-050 began, investigators, site staff, patients, and the study team were masked to study 
lipid levels until the Week 12 study visit, after which time lipid values were made available to sites. 
Visit occur at every 3 months.

Main clinical studies of Ezetimibe 
For ezetimibe monotherapy, a meta-analysis covering eight randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trials (all 12 weeks) in individuals (over 18 years of age) with heterozygous familial 
and nonfamilial hypercholesterolaemia (Pandor et al, 2009) was used to present efficacy and safety 
data (see Table 1 for details on the trials).  In total, 2,722 individuals were enrolled into these trials.  
For ezetimibe combination therapy with statins, the lipid lowering efficacy is presented based on a 
meta-analysis of 27 published clinical trials (n = 21,794) conducted between 1999 and 2008.  All 
studies were randomized, double-blind, active- or placebo-controlled trials that randomised 
hypercholesterolaemic adults to either statin (simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin; 
n = 10,517) or statin plus ezetimibe (n = 11,714) for 6 to 24 weeks (Morrone et al, 2012).  Thirteen 
trials evaluated first-line therapy, while 14 trials evaluated second-line treatment.  The results on 
efficacy in the prevention of cardiovascular events was mainly based on the IMPROVE-IT study 
(Cannon et al, 2015).  This was a study spanning 10 years, that assessed the impact of ezetimibe 
therapy in conjunction with simvastatin compared with simvastatin monotherapy on the rate of major 
cardiovascular events in high-risk patients (n = 18,144 patients).  Additional meta-analyses including 
up to 109,244 patients in 11 randomized clinical trials were used to substantiate efficacy in the 
prevention of cardiovascular events (Ip et al, 2015).

CV risk: patients with the following diseases were 
excluded: congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or IV), 
uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, history of unstable or 
severe peripheral artery disease within 3 months, unstable 
angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass

For 7 % of patients overall, a history of CHD was 
confirmed, and 57% of patients had risk factors or a 
history of CVD. 
The % change from baseline compared with placebo in LDL-C in the individual studies varied from -
16.70% (Bays et al, 2004) to -24.30% (Ballantyne et al, 2003).  
In the pooled set of patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia, ezetimibe monotherapy significantly 
(p <0.00001) reduced LDL-C concentrations by -18.58% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -19.67 
to -17.48) compared with placebo.  Ezetimibe monotherapy also significantly (p <0.00001) improved 
total cholesterol (-13.46%, 95% CI: -14.22 to -12.70), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 
(3.00%, 95% CI: 2.06–3.94) and triglyceride concentrations (-8.06%, 95% CI: -10.92 to -5.20) 
compared with placebo. 
Ezetimibe combination therapy 
(Morrone et al, investigated 2012) the lipid-altering efficacy of ezetimibe/statin combination therapy 
versus statin monotherapy based on 27 published clinical trials (n = 21,794) conducted between 1999 
and 2008.  All studies were randomized, double-blind, active- or placebo-controlled trials that 
randomised hypercholesterolaemic adults to either statin (simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, 
rosuvastatin; n = 10,517) or statin plus ezetimibe (n = 11,714) for 6 to 24 weeks. 
Thirteen trials evaluated first-line therapy, enrolling patients who were either drug naïve or underwent 
washout of previous lipid-modifying therapy.  An additional 14 trials evaluated second-line treatment in 
patients previously on statins or receiving statins during the run-in period.  Baseline characteristics 
were generally well balanced across the treatment overall population as well as within first- and 
second-line therapy subgroups.  The mean age of study participants was 60 years with 36% ≥65 and 
9% ≥75 years of age.  The majority of participants were Caucasian (84%), there were slightly more 
men than women (52% vs. 48%), approximately 1/3 were diagnosed with CHD (34%) or diabetes 
mellitus (30%).  Subjects enrolled in first-line studies had higher mean baseline levels for LDL-C, non-
HDL-C, total C, and triglycerides than participants in second-line studies with prior statin therapy.  
HDL-C baseline levels were generally similar across all study populations. 
In the large pool of patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia, ezetimibe+statin treatment showed 
significant additional improvements in lipid levels compared with statin monotherapy.  The treatment 
difference for percent change from baseline, ie, the effect of ezetimibe on top of the statin treatment 
effect, was -15.1% (p <0.0001) for LDL-C concentrations, -13.5% (p <0.0001) for non-HDL 
cholesterol levels, -10.1% (p <0.0001) for total cholesterol, -4.7% (p <0.0001) for triglycerides, -
8.6% (p <0.0001) for hs-CRP, and 1.6% (p <0.0001) for HDL cholesterol. 
In addition, the percentage of patients achieving lipid concentration goals were higher in the group 
receiving ezetimibe+statin treatment compared with statin monotherapy.  An LDL-C concentration goal 
of <100 mg/dL was achieved by 75.3% vs 51.9% in the ezetimibe+statin and the statin monotherapy 
groups, respectively.  An LDL-C concentration goal of <70 mg/dL was achieved by 33.3% vs 15.1% in 
the ezetimibe+statin and the statin monotherapy groups, respectively.  A non-HDL cholesterol 
concentration goal of <130 mg/dL was achieved by 75.3% vs 52.9% in the ezetimibe+statin and the 
statin monotherapy groups, respectively.  A non-HDL cholesterol concentration goal of <100 mg/dL

was achieved by 40.6% vs 20.7% in the ezetimibe+statin and the statin monotherapy groups, 
respectively. 
Efficacy in the prevention of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events 
IMPROVE-IT (Cannon et al, 2015) was the landmark trial, spanning a 10-year period, which assessed 
the impact of ezetimibe therapy in conjunction with simvastatin 40 mg (ezetimibe/simvastatin; 
n = 9067 patients) compared with simvastatin 40 mg monotherapy (n = 9077 patients) on the rate of 
major cardiovascular events in high-risk adult patients (n = 18,144 patients).  Eligible patients were 
those who had been hospitalized within the preceding 10 days for a myocardial infarction or an ACS, 
who had an LDL-C <125 mg/dL (3.2 mmol/ L) for patients not receiving lipid lowering therapy or <100 
mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) for patients who were receiving lipid lowering therapy.  The patients were 
followed for a median of 6 years during which time they were assessed for major cardiovascular 
events, assessed as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring 
hospital admission, coronary revascularization (
 30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke.  
The study found that the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin 40 mg resulted in a significant reduction 
in LDL-C (median time-weighted average LDL-C during the study of 53.7 mg/dL [1.4 mmol/L] in the 
⩾
simvastatin/ezetimibe group versus 69.5 mg/dL [1.8 mmol/L] in the simvastatin-monotherapy group; 
p <0.001) and that the cardiovascular event rate at 7 years was 32.7% in the simvastatin/ezetimibe 
group compared with 34.7% in the simvastatin monotherapy group (absolute risk reduction 2.0%; HR 
0.936; 95% CI 0.89-0.99; p = 0.016).  This reduction in serious adverse outcomes was against a 
control group already demonstrating a very well treated lipid profile with a mean LDL-C of 69.5 mg/dL 
(1.8 mmol/L), which is well below current target guidelines.  Adverse effects were similar in the two 
groups, demonstrating the safety profile of ezetimibe.  This study provided evidence that ezetimibe 
conferred a protective benefit against major cardiovascular events when used in addition to a statin in 
high-risk patients through further reducing serum LDL-C levels (Banach et al, 2016).   
The PRECISE-IVUS trial assessed patients with coronary artery disease, adopting a different approach 
to assess the effect of ezetimibe on atherosclerotic plaque burden.  This randomized, controlled, 
prospective study compared ezetimibe in combination with atorvastatin with atorvastatin monotherapy, 
utilizing serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound studies to assess and compare coronary plaque 
burden and subsequent plaque regression between the two treatment arms at baseline, 9- and 12-
month intervals after commencing treatment.  There was a superior absolute change in percent 
atheroma volume (PAV) in the atorvastatin/ezetimibe arm compared with the atorvastatin 
monotherapy arm (−1.4% [95% CI: −3.4 to −0.1] vs. −0.3% [95% CI: −1.9% to 0.9%] with 
atorvastatin monotherapy; p = 0.001].  For PAV, a significantly greater percentage of patients in the 
atorvastatin/ezetimibe arm showed coronary plaque regression (78% versus 58%; p = 0.004) (Tsujita 
et al, 2015).  This study therefore demonstrated that ezetimibe in combination with atorvastatin 
induced greater coronary plaque regression than atorvastatin monotherapy in patients with coronary 
artery disease.  
The first major trial assessing the impact of ezetimibe on cardiovascular outcomes was the Study of 
Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) trial (Baigent et al, 2011).  This double blind, randomized trial 
assessed a group of patients with chronic kidney disease, investigating whether treatment with 
simvastatin 20 mg daily plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily had an impact on the incidence of major 
cardiovascular events compared with placebo.  The study confirmed simvastatin/ezetimibe therapy 
significantly reduced both the LDL-C levels and the rate of cardiovascular events.  However, it was 
unclear how much of this beneficial effect was attributed to ezetimibe versus simvastatin.

stable, maximally-tolerated statin therapy. 
Statin intolerance (non-responders study) 
•  Study 1002-048: This is a phase 3 randomized, controlled bempedoic acid study that compared 
bempedoic acid with placebo as add-on therapy to ezetimibe (and no or no more than low doses of 
statins) for 12 weeks. 
Both studies are discussed below. Study 1002-048 has already been discussed above in the context of 
no or-low-dose statin pool ( see section “main studies of bempedoic acid as monocomponent”), 
however, this study is also discussed separately in the context of the effectiveness of the FCMP below.    
Factorial design study 1002FDC-053 (on top of statins) 
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Bempedoic 
Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe 10 mg Fixed Dose Combination Compared to Bempedoic Acid, Ezetimibe, and 
Placebo Alone in Patients Treated with Maximally Tolerated Statin Therapy (1002FDC-053) 
(ClinicalTrials.gov No. NCT03337308) 
Methods 
The primary support for efficacy of the FCMP is provided by Study 1002FDC-053, a 4-arm, randomized, 
double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study of the FCMP compared with bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, 
and placebo as individual components QD added on to a background of maximally tolerated statins in 
patients with high CV risk and hyperlipidemia. 
Screening occurred approximately within 2 weeks prior to randomization. It was planned to randomize 
approximately 350 eligible patients from approximately 125 sites in North America in a 2:2:2:1 ratio 
on Day 1/Week 0 to receive either bempedoic acid 180 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg FCMP (n = 100), 
bempedoic acid 180 mg (n = 100), ezetimibe 10 mg (n = 100), or placebo (n = 50) for 12 weeks. 
Randomized patients returned for clinic visits at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12, see Figure 16. Patients 
who withdrew from study drug treatment were asked to continue to be followed for safety and efficacy. 
Patients were required to be on maximally tolerated statin therapy with doses stable for at least 
4 weeks prior to screening.  Patients may have continued to use stable doses of TG-lowering 
medications (except fibrates and niacin including its derivatives) during the study.  Post-randomization, 
pre-defined TG thresholds were set to notify investigators to provide an opportunity to adjust the 
patient’s standard of care regimen.  To control for effects of diet and exercise on efficacy endpoints, 
patients were counseled to follow a lipid-lowering diet as per local or regional guidelines and 
encouraged to participate in a regular exercise program throughout the study.  Baseline LDL-C was 
defined as the mean of the values from Week -2 and pre-dose at Day 1/Week 0.  Post-randomization, 
LDL-C and other efficacy endpoint results were masked to investigators and all study staff to maintain 
the blind.

Figure 18. Study Flow Chart 
Study Participants 
Patients were included if they had a high/very high CV risk (ASCVD, HeFH and/or multiple CV risk 
factors) with hyperlipidemia defined as LDL-C at Week -2: ≥100 mg/dL if ASCVD and/or HeFH 
≥130 mg/dL if multiple CV risk factors were present. 
CV risk definition 
High risk was defined as diagnosis of HeFH or ASCVD (with established CHD or CHD risk equivalents).  
Established CHD included 1 or more of either MI, silent MI, unstable angina, coronary revascularization 
procedure, or clinically significant CHD diagnosed by invasive or non-invasive testing.  Risk of CHD 
included 1 or more of either peripheral arterial disease, previous ischemic stroke with a focal ischemic 
neurological deficit that persisted ≥ 24 hours.  Diagnosis of HeFH must have been made by either 
genotyping or by clinical assessment using either the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria/Dutch 
Lipid Clinical Network Criteria with a score that was > 8 points or the Simon Broome Register 
Diagnostic Criteria with an assessment of Definite HeFH. 
Multiple cardiovascular risk factors defined as diabetes + 1 other risk factor or 3 risk factors that may 
have included, increased age (>45 men, >55 women), family history, smoking, hypertension, low 
HDL-C, coronary calcium score >95% for age/sex. 
Relevant other exclusion criteria 
TGs ≥500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), eGFR (MDRD) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, liver disease or dysfunction, 
ALT/AST ≥2 × ULN, bilirubin ≥1.2 × ULN; creatine kinase (CK) >3 × ULN, and within 3 months CV 
disease or intervention. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized to receive either bempedoic acid 180 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg FCMP, 
bempedoic acid 180 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg, or placebo QD by mouth with or without food in a 2:2:2:1 
randomisation for 12 weeks.

Objectives 
The co-primary objectives were to assess LDL-C lowering efficacy in patients receiving maximally 
tolerated statin therapy and treated for 12 weeks with bempedoic acid 180 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg 
FCMP vs placebo, bemepdoic acid 180 mg, and ezetimibe 10 mg. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary efficacy endpoints consisted of 3 comparisons of the percent change from baseline to week 
12 in LDL-C for the FCMP versus placebo, FCMP versus ezetimibe, and FCMP versus bempedoic acid.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percent change from baseline to Week 12 in hsCRP, non-
HDL-C, apo B, and TC.   
Sample size 
The assumed treatment difference in percent change in LDL-C at Week 12 between FDC and ezetimibe 
or bempedoic acid would be 13% with a standard deviation (SD) of 25%, and versus placebo 33% with 
SD of 25%. A sample size of 100 patients per active treatment group and 50 patients in the placebo 
arm (2:2:2:1) was selected to provide 95% power to detect a difference between FDC and ezetimibe 
or bempedoic acid at an alpha level of 0.05 using a 2-sided t-test, and >99% power to detect a 
difference between FDC and placebo. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomized by an interactive web response system (IWRS) in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. The 
randomization was stratified by baseline statin intensity (high intensity (atorvastatin 40 to 80 mg/day 
and rosuvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day) vs other) and disease characteristics (ASCVD and/or HeFH vs 
multiple cardiovascular risk factors).  
Statistical methods 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group and randomization stratification as factors 
and baseline LDL-C as a covariate were performed to compare treatment groups (LDL-C: FDC vs 
placebo, FDC vs ezetimibe, and FDC vs bempedoic acid) for the primary endpoint using the FAS. In 
cases where the number of patients within a stratum was too small for a meaningful analysis, the 
strata were combined to obtain a larger cell size. The LS mean and SE, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
and associated p values for each treatment group, as well as for each treatment group comparison are 
provided. To account for the possibility of unequal variances between the groups, the ANCOVA model 
was implemented within a mixed model framework, where the <repeated/group=> option was used to 
allow separate estimation of residual variances for different groups. 
Each of the comparisons within the co-primary endpoint family was conducted at a significance level of 
0.05. If all 3 tests within the co-primary endpoint family achieved statistical significance, the 
hypothesis testing continued to the secondary endpoints; otherwise, all statistical comparisons for 
secondary endpoints were to be considered descriptive only. 
Missing data was primarily handled using a pattern mixture model. Patients with missing lipid data that 
also discontinued study medication had their data imputed using placebo based imputation. Patients 
with missing data who were still taking study medication had data imputed using active arm 
imputation. Sensitivity analyses were performed using observed cases only, using on-treatment, 
completer and observed data analysis.

In the post hoc analysis that excluded three sites, a total of 301 patients were enrolled into the study 
and randomized, as follows: 86 patients in the FCMP group, 88 patients in the bempedoic acid group, 
86 patients in the ezetimibe group, and 41 patients in the placebo group Table 32.  Most patients 
(94.4%) completed the study (ie, completed all protocol-defined visits).  IMP was discontinued in 
13.6% of patients (11.6% FCMP, 14.8% bempedoic acid, 15.1% ezetimibe, 12.2% placebo).  The most 
common reason for IMP discontinuation across all groups was adverse event (8.1% FCMP, 10.2% 
bempedoic acid, 11.6% ezetimibe, 4.9% placebo).

Study 1002FDC-053: 382 patients enrolled and randomized, 381 patients treated. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Treatment with the FCMP resulted in significantly greater reductions from baseline for LS mean LDL-C 
(-31.5%) compared with placebo (-2.5%), compared with ezetimibe (-21.0%), and compared with 
bempedoic acid (-17.7%). The differences from placebo, ezetimibe and bempedoic acid for LS means 
were -29.0 % (p<0.001), -10.5% (p=0.001), and -13.8% (p<0.001), respectively.  Mean absolute 
changes from baseline to Week 12 in LDL-C were -1.32, -0.70, -0.85, and -0.13 mmol/L for the FCMP, 
bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, and placebo groups, respectively (observed data). 
For the post-hoc (sensitivity) analysis treatment with the FCMP resulted in significantly greater 
reductions from baseline for LS mean LDL-C (-36.2%) compared with placebo (+1.8%) (p <0.001),

Results of sensitivity analyses for key secondary endpoints were as follows. 
The LS mean difference with the FDC was statistically significantly different from ezetimibe, bempedoic 
acid, and placebo for non-HDL-C (-33.7% vs plb, -12.1% vs eze, -17.8% vs bempedoic acid) , TC (-
27.1%, -10.4%, -14.2%), and apo B (-30.1%, -9.3%, -12.8%) for all 3 comparisons. 
Results for percent change from baseline in Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL C) at Week 12 
excluding three sites, were comparable to the results from the overall population as shown below in

Methods 
Figure 25. 1002-048 Study Design 
Screening period 
Patients on low-dose or less than low-dose statin therapy (including patients unable to tolerate a statin 
at any dose) and who required additional LDL-C lowering were eligible for screening. 
Patients started screening at Week -5, approximately 5 weeks prior to randomization. Patients must 
have had LDL-C of ≥100 mg/dL (or ≥120 mg/dL if not on ezetimibe). The 1-week screening could have 
been extended for an additional 4 weeks if needed, to adjust background medical therapy or for other 
reasons. Eligible patients returned to the clinical site at Week -4 to begin treatment with study-
supplied ezetimibe and single-blind placebo. 
Placebo and Ezetimibe Run-in Period 
Patients were treated in the single-blind, placebo run-in period with study-supplied and labelled 
ezetimibe and placebo at Week -4 (Day -28 to ±3 days). If a patient was already taking ezetimibe, 
they stopped taking their personal supply of ezetimibe and began taking study-supplied ezetimibe. 
Patients were assessed to determine if they still met all enrollment criteria. At Week -1, patients 
returned (Day -7 to ±3 days) for continued determination of enrollment criteria. 
Lipid sample collection  
Samples were collected and analyzed for basic fasting lipids (calculated LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, 
and TGs), apo B and hsCRP at a central clinical laboratory in each study.  Blood draws for lipids were 
required to be taken after a minimum 10-hour fast (water was allowed).  LDL-C was calculated, or if 
TGs were > 400 mg/dL or LDL-C was < 50 mg/dL, LDL-C was measured directly. 
Data monitoring  
In this study, 2 committees monitored data during study conduct.  An unblinded independent data 
monitoring committee monitored accumulating patient safety and efficacy data until the last patient 
completed study treatment.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 131/239 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Participants 
Patients were required to have a fasting LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) when already on ezetimibe 
on stable background LMT (≥4 weeks prior to screening), or LDL-C ≥120 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L) on 
stable background LMT (≥4 weeks prior to screening) when not on ezetimibe, 5 weeks before 
randomization. All patients had to have had fasting LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) 1 week before 
randomisation. 
Patients could have received stable (≥4 weeks prior to screening) background statin dose that did not 
exceed low-dose statin therapy. Patients had to have reported attempting statin therapy and being 
unable to tolerate it due to an adverse safety effect that started or increased during statin therapy and 
resolved or improved when statin therapy was discontinued or the dose lowered. 
Relevant other exclusion criteria 
TGs ≥500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), eGFR (MDRD) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, liver disease or dysfunction, 
ALT/AST ≥2 × ULN, bilirubin ≥1.2 × ULN; creatine kinase (CK) >3 × ULN, and within 3 months CV 
disease or intervention. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive bempedoic acid 180 mg or placebo QD. Study-supplied 
ezetimibe was started at week -4. 
Objectives 
To assess the 12-week efficacy of bempedoic acid 180 mg/day vs placebo in decreasing LDL-C when 
added to ezetimibe therapy in patients with elevated LDL-C. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline to week 12 in LDL-C. 
The secondary outcomes were percent change from baseline to Week 12 in non-HDL-C, TC, apo B, 
hsCRP, TGs and HDL-C 
Sample size 
The estimated sample size of 150 randomized patients in the bempedoic acid group and 75 randomized 
patients in the placebo group was determined to provide more than 95% power to detect a difference 
of 15% in the percent change from baseline to Week 12 in calculated LDL-C between the bempedoic 
acid treatment group and the placebo group. This calculation was based on a 2-sided t-test at the 5% 
level of significance and a common standard deviation of 15%. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to bempedoic acid or matching placebo using an interactive web 
response system (IWRS). 
In all studies, study medication was administered in a double-blind fashion. The Sponsor, all clinical 
site personnel (eg, investigator, pharmacist), other vendor personnel, and patients were blinded to the 
treatment group for each patient. Patients were also blinded to the treatment they received. Unblinded 
user(s) were designated for each clinical site and at the Sponsor (or designee) as needed to perform 
emergency unblinding of treatment for an individual patient e.g. in case the safety of the patient might 
have been at risk.

Post-randomization values for LDL-C, TGs, TC, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo B, and hsCRP, including any 
plasma concentration of the bempedoic acid analyte (ETC-1002) and its metabolite (ESP15228), were 
not available to personnel from the clinical site, the patient, the Sponsor, or CRO. 
Statistical methods 
For study 048, The primary efficacy endpoint was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
with treatment group as a factor and baseline LDL-C as a covariate. The ANCOVA was performed using 
the FAS, with patients included in their randomized treatment group regardless of the treatment they 
actually received. To account for the likelihood of unequal variances between the treatment groups, 
the robust variance estimator was used to allow estimating the residual variances separately between 
the treatment groups. Model assumptions for performing ANCOVA were assessed and if the 
assumptions were severely violated, non-parametric method was considered. 
Multiplicity due to the multiple endpoints was handled by testing the endpoints in a stepdown 
approach. 
Missing data was primarily handled using a pattern mixture model. Patients with missing lipid data that 
also discontinued study medication had their data imputed using placebo based imputation. Patients 
with missing data who were still taking study medication had data imputed using active arm 
imputation. Sensitivity analyses were performed using observed cases only, using on-treatment, 
completer and observed data analysis.

Outcomes and estimation 
Reduction from baseline in LDL-C for bempedoic acid versus placebo was -23.5% vs 5.0%, 
respectively, which was significantly different (p < 0.001).  The absolute difference from placebo was -
0.93 mmol/L at Week 12.   
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses are provided in Figure 24 below. 
Figure 26. Forest Plot of Percent Change from Baseline to Week 12 in LDL-C by Subgroups 
(Full Analysis Set) 
The sensitivity analysis using an on-treatment approach (FAS) was performed for the primary 
endpoint; the difference in LS means between bempedoic acid and placebo was -31.49% (p <0.001). 
In the Completer Analysis Set, all patients were required to comply with protocol-defined treatment of 
double-blind IMP and ezetimibe, as well as having a non-missing LDL-C value at Week 12. The 
difference in LS means between bempedoic acid and placebo was -31.28% (p <0.001). The third 
sensitivity analysis included observed data only with no imputation for missing data (assumed missing 
completely at random). The difference in LS means between bempedoic acid and placebo was -29.31% 
(p <0.001). 
Summary of main efficacy results 
The summary of main efficacy results is already presented in Table 27 (page 101). These

Pooled phase 3 studies post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup in patients with background 
statin therapy (selected patient on ezetimibe background therapy from studies 040 
and 047) 
The 4 pivotal phase 3 studies as part of the bempedoic acid monotherapy MAA (Studies 1002-047, 
1002-040, 1002-046, and 1002-048) were double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-
group, multicenter studies with bempedoic acid 180 mg per day in 3621 adult patients at risk for CV 
events with primary hyperlipidemia when used alone and in combination with HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitors (statins) and/or other stable lipid-modifying therapy, including ezetimibe and PCSK9 
inhibitors. Data from these studies included coadminstration with ezetimibe. Study 048 is discussed 
separately as bempedoic acid was compared to placebo on a study supplied background therapy of 
ezetimibe in statin intolerant patients. 
In the 2 Phase 3, 52-week studies (1002-040 and 1002-047), patients on maximally tolerated statin 
could continue their other LMTs, including ezetimibe.  Of the 2010 patients randomized to bempedoic 
acid in these studies, 150 patients reported ezetimibe background therapy; of the 999 patients 
randomized to placebo, 76 patients were also on ezetimibe background therapy.  In post hoc subgroup 
analyses by ezetimibe use at baseline, the mean reduction from baseline to Week 12 in LDL-C for 
bempedoic acid compared with placebo was -16.2% vs -2.8%, respectively (p <0.001) in patients 
taking ezetimibe, and -16.7% vs 2.1%, respectively (p <0.001) in patients not taking ezetimibe.  
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Two placebo-controlled studies (046 and 048) were performed to investigate and confirm the LDL-C 
lipid lowering treatment effect of bempedoic acid in statin-intolerant patients. Patients with high CV 
risk eligible for further lipid lowering therapy based on their LDL-C level were included.   
The general design of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (2:1), parallel-group studies 
should allow for the primary objective of an adequate evaluation of the bempedoic acid treatment 
effect on LDL-C reduction. The studies were limited in duration with respectively 24 and 12 weeks of 
treatment and included a relatively limited number of patients. In study 048 no PCSK9 inhibitors were 
allowed, limiting interpretation in terms of reflecting clinical practice options in lipid lowering 
treatment. A 2:1 randomisation is acceptable to optimise exposure to the investigational product. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 140/239 
 
 
 
 
 
 
primary endpoint of LDL-C lowering was assessed at 12 weeks, which is sufficiently long to establish 
the maximum stable LDL-C treatment effect. The secondary endpoints of the Week 24 percentage LDL-
C reduction (as evaluated in study 046) can be supportive for the primary endpoint and is acceptable. 
Other parameters of the lipid profile (nonHDL-C, TC, apoB) were evaluated as secondary endpoints, 
which is considered relevant and supported. The relevance of evaluation of hsCRP as the secondary 
endpoint is considered of less importance as the clinical implication is less clear. A 4 week run-in period 
is relatively short but acceptable to stabilise for background diet/exercise and LLT therapy. Specific 
stabilisation periods have been included for fibrates (6 weeks) and PCSK9 inhibitors (at least 3 
injections), which is appropriate. To establish baseline LDL-C levels in phase 3 studies based on week -
1 and 0 is appropriate.  
Identification of patients eligible for lipid lowering therapy was based on the combination of CV 
risk classification and LDL-C level. In study 046, LDL-C had to be ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) at baseline. 
Although that for study 048 inclusion was only based on LDL-C level LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) at 
baseline without any CV risk level requirement, post-hoc analyses demonstrate that these patients 
satisfy to lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) treatment criteria. 
Whether the population could be defined as a population with hypercholesterolemia as proposed in 
the requested indication, screening criteria before entering the run-in phase of the studies needs to be 
considered. For studies 046 and 048 the screening inclusion criteria were meeting the definition of 
hypercholesterolemia. At screening, this was an LDL-C level of ≥ 130 mg/dL in primary prevention 
patients and ≥ 100 mg/dL in secondary prevention while in study 046, and ≥ 100 mg/dL in patients 
taking ezetimibe and ≥ 120 mg/dL in patients not taking ezetimibe in study 048. 
Definition of statin intolerance for study 046 was defined as an inability to tolerate 2 or more 
statins, one at a low dose, due to an adverse safety effect that started or increased during statin 
therapy and resolved or improved when statin therapy was discontinued. In this respect, to consider 
patient statin intolerant who are treated with lower than the defined very-low dose can be acceptable. 
Whether patients in study 048 would be statin intolerant based on the inclusion criteria was less clear. 
Patients had to have attempted one statin treatment and were unable to tolerate it due to an adverse 
safety effect that started or increased during statin therapy and resolved or improved when statin 
therapy was discontinued or the dose lowered. The exclusion criteria are generally acceptable to 
optimize study adherence and reduce potential dropouts, comply with inclusion criteria, reduce 
potential tolerability issues with background medication, and exclude any possible relevant 
confounding. 
Lipid sample collection by a centralised laboratory is appropriate and according to current study 
standards. Sample sizes were calculated to provide 95% power to observe a difference of 15% on the 
percent change from baseline in LDL-C, which is considered clinically relevant. The statistical analysis 
plans for the studies were considered acceptable. 
On top of statins 
Two placebo-controlled studies (047 and 040) were performed to investigate and confirm the LDL-C 
lipid lowering treatment effect of bempedoic acid. In these studies the effect was evaluated on top of 
maximum tolerated statin therapy with other lipid lowering therapy. Patients with high CV risk eligible 
for further lipid lowering therapy based on their LDL-C level were included. The larger study 040 was 
limited in the sense that no PCSK9 inhibitors treatment was allowed as background therapy in contrast 
to the considerable smaller study 047, including comparable study patients and with comparable study 
evaluation period (52 weeks). Overall, these studies potentially allow for a short- and intermediate 
term evaluation of the lipid lowering effect of bempedoic acid in patients eligible for lipid lowering 
therapy according to current guideline standards. An open-label long-term study which is currently 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 141/239 
 
 
 
 
ongoing should provide additional data on the maintenance of effect beyond one year of therapy. 
Although, data will be limited as the study is currently ongoing. 
The general design of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (2:1), parallel-group studies  
should allow for the primary objective of an adequate evaluation of the bempedoic acid treatment 
effect on LDL-C reduction either on top of lipid lowering therapy including maximum tolerated statin 
therapy or in patients who are statin intolerant. A 2:1 randomisation is acceptable to optimise 
exposure to the investigational product. The primary endpoint of LDL-C lowering was assessed at 12 
weeks, which is sufficiently long to establish the maximum stable LDL-C treatment effect. The 52 
weeks treatment period should support for longer maintenance of effect. However, it was not fully 
understood why the largest 040 study is primarily designed as a safety study, although the efficacy 
was evaluated in a comparable method as the other studies. The secondary endpoints of the Week 24 
percentage LDL-C reduction can be supportive for the primary endpoint and is acceptable. Other 
parameters of the lipid profile (nonHDL-C, TC, apoB) was evaluated as secondary endpoints, which is 
considered relevant and supported. The specific 2 week run-in for the largest 040 study is very short to 
exclude any possible confounding of background therapy on the efficacy treatment evaluation, 
however, patients needed already be on stable therapy prior to this run-in phase. To establish baseline 
LDL-C levels in phase 3 studies based on week -1 and 0 is appropriate. Adjunctive LMT could be 
initiated after 24 weeks in both 52 weeks studies per investigator discretion if protocol-defined LDL-C 
threshold criteria were met, which is acceptable and would not favour any study treatment outcomes.  
Identification of patients eligible for lipid lowering therapy was appropriately based on the combination 
of CV risk classification and LDL-C level, and in accord with treatment guidelines of learned societies 
(ESC, AHA). Patients were included based on LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL at Week -2 (study 040) or baseline 
(study 047) and high CV risk (diagnosis of HeFH or ASCVD [established CHD or CHD risk equivalent]).  
Whether the population could be defined as a population with hypercholesterolemia as proposed in the 
requested indication, screening criteria before entering the run-in phase of the studies needs to be 
considered.  For study 047, the screening inclusion criteria were meeting the definition of 
hypercholesterolemia. At screening, this was a LDL-C level of ≥ 100 mg/dL. However, for study 040 in 
patients on stable maximum tolerated statin dose, LDL-C had to be ≥ 70 mg/dL at Screening (Week -
2), which is not necessarily hypercholesterolemia, but these patients would likely had 
hypercholesterolemia at start of statin therapy in the past (start of therapy unknown). The exclusion 
criteria are generally acceptable to optimize study adherence and reduce potential dropouts, comply 
with inclusion criteria, reduce potential tolerability issues with background medication, and exclude any 
possible relevant confounding. 
Lipid sample collection by a centralised laboratory and data monitoring and CV events adjudication by 
independent committees is appropriate and according to current study standards. 
Sample sizes were calculated to provide 95% power to observe a difference of 15% on the percent 
change from baseline in LDL-C, which is considered clinically relevant. The statistical analysis plans for 
the studies are considered acceptable. 
Phase 2 studies 
Several phase 2 studies were performed to evaluate the lipid lowering effect of bemepdoic acid either 
as monotherapy (1) including dose finding studies (3), concomitantly with other lipid lowering therapy 
of atorvastatin (1) and atorvastatin+ezetimibe (1), and on top of statin therapy with one being a dose 
finding study (3) or PCSK9 therapy (1). Study treatment including other LLT of atorvastatin and/or 
ezetimibe was controlled by a washout period of LLT prior to evaluation in the studies. Almost all 
studies used LDL-C lowering as the primary endpoint with evaluation after 4 weeks to 12 weeks. Only 
study 007 (study on top of statins) was a safety study but LDL-C lowering efficacy was evaluated after

8 weeks of treatment. These studies allow for a first evaluation of the treatment effect of bempedoic 
acid either alone or in combination with other lipid lowering therapies and to identify the optimal dose 
for the phase 3 confirmatory phase. 
Ezetimibe 
Literature data identified relevant placebo controlled randomised studies investigating the lipid 
lowering effect of ezetimibe as monotherapy, in combination with statins, and investigating the effect 
on CV outcomes. 
FCMP 
Factorial design study on top of statins (study1002FDC-053)  
A 4-arm factorial design study was performed comparing the FCMP with bempedoic acid alone, 
ezetimibe alone, and placebo added on to stable maximally-tolerated statin therapy. Patients with high 
CV risk eligible for lipid lowering treatment were included.  
The general design of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group should allow for an 
adequate evaluation of the bempedoic acid with or without ezetimibe treatment effect on LD-C 
reduction. The 2:2:2:1 randomisation as applied in this study is acceptable to optimise exposure to the 
investigational products. The primary endpoint of percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 
can be acceptable to evaluate the maximum and stable change in LDL-C lowering effect of bempedoic 
acid with ezetimibe compared to the monocomponents. Other parameters of the lipid profile (non-HDL-
C, TC, apoB, TG, HDL-C) will also be evaluated as secondary endpoints, which is considered relevant 
and supported. The relevance of evaluation of hsCRP as secondary endpoint is considered of less 
importance as the clinical implication is less clear. A 2 week screening period is appropriate, as 
patients had to be stable on statin therapy already for at least 4 weeks prior screening. This study is 
only performed in the US which could limit interpretation for the EU situation. To establish baseline 
LDL-C levels based on week -1 and 0, or -2 and 0 is appropriate. Lipid sample collection by a 
centralised laboratory is appropriate and according to current study standards. 
Identification of patients eligible for lipid lowering therapy was based on the combination of CV risk 
classification and LDL-C level in accord with treatment guidelines for learned societies. Patients were 
included at screening when they had established CV disease and or HeFH and ≥100 mg/dL (2.6 
mmol/L), or when they had multiple CV risk factors and LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L), despite 
being on maximum statin therapy. Although, commonly in clinical practice such patients would not 
start to be treated with a combination of two lipid lowering drugs rather with a single lipid lowering 
drug additional treatment to statins. General exclusion criteria are acceptable to optimize study 
adherence and reduce potential dropouts, to comply with inclusion criteria, reduce potential tolerability 
issues with background medication, and exclude any possible relevant confounding. 
Sample size was calculated to provide sufficient power to observe a difference of 13% on the percent 
change from baseline in LDL-C for the FCMP versus ezetimibe or bempedoic acid and a difference of 
33% versus placebo. This difference is considered clinically relevant. In general, the statistical analysis 
plans are considered acceptable. However, the sensitivity analyses are considered optimistic, as they 
rely on on-treatment data.  
Study in statin intolerant patients as add-on to ezetimibe (study 1002-048)  
A randomized controlled phase 3 study in statin intolerant patients was performed to compare 
bempedoic acid with placebo as add-on therapy to ezetimibe.  
The general design of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group should allow for an 
adequate evaluation of the bempedoic acid with ezetimibe treatment effect on LD-C reduction. The 2:1

randomisation as applied in this study is acceptable to optimise exposure to the investigational 
product. The primary endpoint of percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 can be acceptable 
to evaluate the maximum and stable change in LDL-C lowering effect of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe 
compared to the monocomponents. Other parameters of the lipid profile (non-HDL-C, TC, apoB, TG, 
HDL-C) will also be evaluated as secondary endpoints, which is considered relevant and supported. The 
relevance of evaluation of hsCRP as secondary endpoint is considered of less importance as the clinical 
implication is less clear. The 4-week placebo or ezetimibe run-in period is relatively short but 
acceptable to stabilise for study supplied ezetimibe therapy. To establish baseline LDL-C levels based 
on week -1 and 0, or -2 and 0 is appropriate. Lipid sample collection by a centralised laboratory is 
appropriate and according to current study standards. 
The screening inclusion was meeting the definition of hypercholesterolemia, with ≥ 100 mg/dL in 
patients taking ezetimibe (≥4 weeks prior to screening), and ≥ 120 mg/dL in patients not taking 
ezetimibe (≥4 weeks prior to screening), 5 weeks before randomization. After the placebo and 
ezetimibe run-in of 4 weeks. Identification of patients eligible for randomization was based on LDL-C 
level LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) at baseline without any CV risk level requirement.  
General exclusion criteria are acceptable to optimize study adherence and reduce potential dropouts, 
to comply with inclusion criteria, reduce potential tolerability issues with background medication, and 
exclude any possible relevant confounding. 
Sample sizes for 048 study were calculated to provide at least 95% power to observe a difference of 
15% on the percent change from baseline in LDL-C. This difference is considered clinically relevant. In 
general, the statistical analysis plans for the studies are considered acceptable. However, the 
sensitivity analyses are considered optimistic, as they rely on on-treatment data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Phase 2 studies 
Four dose finding phase 2 studies were performed in hyperlipidemic patients with either normal or 
elevated TGs designed as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 studies. These studies 
included 177 with hyperlipidemia, 56 (statin-intolerant), 349 (with or without statin intolerance) and 
134 patients (stable statin dose), respectively.  
An LDL-C lowering effect was observed in the range of 40 to 120 mg bempedoic acid dose after 12 
weeks (-15.7%, -22.9%, and -24.5%; p<0.001), 60 mg uptitrated to 120 mg and 180 mg uptitrated 
to 240 mg (each dose 2 weeks) ((60 mg, -18.0%; 120 mg, -30.0%; 180 mg, -28.8%, 240 mg -
28.5%). In another study, the LS mean difference from ezetimibe monotherapy for percent change in 
LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 was -6.5% for bempedoic acid 120 mg (p = 0.0008), -8.91% for 
bempedoic acid 180 mg (p <0.0001), -21.86% for bempedoic acid 120 mg + ezetimibe (p <0.0001), 
and -26.5% for bempedoic acid 180 mg + ezetimibe (p <0.0001). In a study of 120 and 180 mg 
bempedoic acid on top of statins after 12 weeks, the LS mean relative to placebo was -13.1% 
(p = 0.0055), and -20.1% (p <0.0001), respectively. 
A pooled analysis of 6 phase 2 studies in 832 patients (580 on BA) also demonstrated a dose 
dependent effect up to 180 mg QD dose; placebo adjusted LDL-C: -18.3%, -25.5%, -29.8%, -32.4%, 
and -28.8% with bempedoic acid 60, 80, 120, 180, and 240 mg QD, respectively. Higher doses than 
the 180 mg QD dose did not provide an additional lipid lowering effect versus placebo. Also, on top of 
statins, the 180 provided the largest effect (-21.7%) with no additional effect with the 240 mg dose (-
21.7%). The (additional) effect of bempedoic acid on top of statin was lower than compared to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 144/239 
 
 
 
 
bempedoic effect versus placebo. The effect of bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe obviously showed the 
largest treatment effect (-45.6% BA 120 mg + 10 mg eze, -50.1% BA 180 mg +10 mg eze). Overall, 
these data reasonably support the choice for the 180 mg QD dose as evaluated in the phase 3 studies. 
Statin intolerance  
All studies represent a study population of primarily Caucasians at high or very high CV risk and at 
relative increased age (mean 64 to 65 years of age; Caucasian 85% to 91%). CV risk estimation was 
distributed across patients with ASCVD (39-40%) and patients at increased CV risk based on CV risk 
factors including e.g. hypertension (58-68%), diabetes (19-27%) and (history of) smoking 
(approximately 40%). The 046 study in statin intolerant patients was only performed in US and 
Canada, and thus may be less representative for the EU situation, although these patients would also 
be eligible for LMT according to EU criteria.  In these studies, 8-10% in study 046 used statins, and in 
study 048 28-33% used statins with most patients below low dose and some at a low dose. Further, 
these studies largely present a hypercholesterolemic patient population as baseline mean LDL-C level 
ranged from 123.0 (27.20) to 158.5 (40.39) mg/dL (3.18 – 4.1 mmol/L). Screening levels also 
represent those of a hypercholesterolemic population. 
Randomisation was successful, with only slight differences between treatment groups for almost all 
patient characteristics. Efficacy analysis based on the FAS is an acceptable approach. 
A significant reduction (p<0.001) on the primary endpoint of percent LDL-C reduction after 12 weeks 
of treatment was observed with -21.4% (95%CI -25.1, -17.7%) and -28.5% (95%CI -34.4, -22.5%) 
for study 046 and 048, respectively. The effect on LDL-C reduction was slightly diminished during 24 
weeks in study 046 (-18.9%; p<0.001). The primary LDL-C lowering effect was supported by 
secondary analysis demonstrating significant reductions for other lipid parameters including non-HDL-
C, TC, and apoB (p<0.001) after 12 weeks of treatment. Some significant percent reduction was also 
observed in the hsCRP level, being assessed as a secondary endpoint. Results on the proportion of 
patients achieving hsCRP levels of < 2 mg/L showed that more patients met this criterion in the statin 
intolerant pool (43.3% vs 16.7% at week 12, p<0.001). However, the clinical meaning of these results 
is unclear. 
Comparable results across many of the subgroups were noticed for the treatment effect of bempedoic 
acid after 12 weeks. However, differences in effect on LDL-C were noticed for some subgroups 
including non-Hispanic vs Hispanic (ethnicity; <0.001), diabetes (0.032) and statin use (0.032). Also, 
the effect was larger when ezetimibe was present compared to no ezetimibe use. This effect is mainly 
driven by the difference in effect on LDL-C between study 046 and 048. Because in study 048 all 
patients used ezetimibe while in study 046 approximately 14% used ezetimibe and the overall LDL-C 
effect in study 048 was larger. Furthermore, for the age subgroups of age categories of < 65, 65 to 75 
and ≥ 75 and <85 and ≥ 85 years no substantial differences or trends for the difference in effect was 
noticed, although the number of patients in the ≥ 85 years of age group was very limited.  
On top of statins 
For the phase 3 studies on top of maximum tolerated statin therapy, a large number of patients were 
included with 2230 patient in the largest 040 study, and 779 patients in the 047 study. A large 
proportion of patients completed the study, this was comparable for bempedoic acid (93-94%) versus 
placebo (95-97%). Main reasons for discontinuations of treatment were adverse events and withdrawal 
by the patient. Discontinuation of study treatment was higher for bempedoic acid than for placebo 
(20.5%-23.2% vs 16.7-19.1%). Adverse events were a main cause of study drug discontinuation 
(10.3-10.8% vs 7.4-8.2%). Other reasons that contributed most but in variable proportion across the 
different studies were patients withdrawals, patient decision and sponsor decision.

Several amendments were made in these studies. Most of these amendments likely have a low impact 
on the overall results, while sensitivity analyses were proposed to check on the consequences of these 
amendments. Increase of sample size to increase the overall numbers to further support the safety 
assessment is acceptable. Amendment 5 in study 040 and amendment 3 in study 047 were relevant 
(considering the non-allowance of doses of simvastatin of 40 mg or higher). Those patients treated 
with a 40 mg dose (n=98) have discontinued in study 040. This amendment was introduced as a 
significant increase in simvastatin exposure was observed that was induced by bempedoic acid. 
Currently in the labelling it is proposed to limit the simvastatin dose to 20 mg in general and 40 mg for 
high risk patients prior to introducing bempedoic acid therapy (see further safety discussion).  
All studies represent a study population of primarily Caucasians at high or very high CV risk and at 
relatively increased age (mean age range 64 to 67 years; Caucasian 94% to 97%). In these studies, 
50-53% were on high intensity statin, and 31-43% on medium intensity statin. Very high CV risk was 
mainly identified based on the presence of ASVCD (93-95%) while few patients with HeFH were 
included (5-6%). Also, these studies were largely performed within Europe (66-72%) and thus are 
representative for the EU situation. In these studies, high intensity statins of atorvastatin (55-67%,) 
and rosuvastatin (17-33%) were used most, especially the 40 mg dose of atorvastatin (29%). 
Although PCSK9 inhibitors were allowed in study 047, there use was minimal (0.2-0.4%), which could 
be due to the timing of the studies, when CV outcome was not yet available. The studies largely 
include a hypercholesterolemic patient population as baseline mean LDL-C level ranged from 102.3 
(30.05) mg/dL (2.63 mmol/L) to 122.4 (38.30) mg/dL (3.15 mmol/L) as a result of the specific 
inclusion criteria for these trials. LDL-C at screening also indicate that patients were well above the 2.6 
mmol/L threshold to consider them to be hypercholesterolemic. 
Randomisation was successful, with only slight differences between treatment groups for almost all 
patient characteristics. Efficacy analysis based on the FAS is an acceptable approach. 
A significant reduction (p<0.001) on the primary endpoint of percent LDL-C reduction after 12 weeks 
of treatment was observed. This reduction was clinically relevant with -18.1% (95%CI -20.0, -16.1%) 
and -17.4% (95%CI -20.9, -13.8%) for the 040 and 047 studies, respectively, although this was lower 
than for the statin intolerant study pool. The relative lower effect in patients on background maximum 
tolerated statin therapy may partly be explained by the lower LDL-C baseline levels (more optimally 
treated) than the statin intolerant studies. However, the net effect is also the sum of the likely 
diminished PD effect due to inhibition in the similar pathway of bempedoic acid and statins, and the 
likely increased PD effect of bempedoic acid induced increased exposure of statins. The effect on LDL-C 
reduction was maintained during 24 weeks in the studies 040 and 047 on top of statins (-19.5%, -
18.2%, respectively; p<0.001). The LDL-C lowering treatment effect resulted in significantly more 
patients meeting the LDL-C < 70 mg/dL goal (28.9% vs 8.0% at week 12 and 26.2% vs 9.1% at week 
52). The primary LDL-C lowering effect was supported by secondary analysis demonstrating significant 
reductions for other lipid parameters including non-HDL-C, TC, and apoB (p<0.001) after 12 weeks of 
treatment.   
These primary and secondary evaluations were supported by additional analyses on the maintenance 
of effect and effects according to subgroups. In the studies with maximum tolerated statin background 
therapy (study 040, 047) the LDL-C lowering treatment effect of bempedoic acid was maintained, 
although slightly diminished up to 52 weeks (-13.6% and -12.3%, respectively). The slightly 
diminished effect could have been partly caused by the allowance of change of the background therapy 
(9.2% of the patients) after 24 weeks. More specifically, background LLT therapy was slightly less 
intensified in the bempedoic acid treatment arm than in the placebo arm (8.8% vs 10.1%; n= 278). 
This was mainly adjunctive therapy of statins (7.0% vs 8.0%), while evolocumab and alirocumab use 
was very limited (5 (0.2%) vs 4 (0.4%) and 3 (0.4%) vs 1 (0.1%)) and the latter may likely not have 
significantly contributed to the diminished effect. Of notice, the addition of statin therapy could be of

interest to substantiate the additional effect of statin in combination with bempedoic acid to provide 
some support for the current dose recommendation for statins in the labelling; these data have 
currently however not been presented.  Further support for the maintenance of effect is provided in the 
ongoing open-label extension study where the LDL-C lowering effect after one year (2 years in total) 
was -16.8% (23.4%) in the former placebo patients (n = 131) and -15.8% (24.6%) in the former 
bempedoic acid patients from study 040 (n = 288)). 
Further, comparable results across many of the subgroups were noticed for the treatment effect of 
bempedoic acid after 12 weeks. However, differences were noticed for some subgroups: the effect was 
increased for female vs male (gender; p interaction 0.044), different for BMI categories (0.007), and 
lower with increased statin intensity (0.060). A difference was also noted with background ezetimibe 
therapy (lower with ezetimibe), however, p for interaction was apparently not significant. Differences 
in exposure between male and female may have contributed to the different treatment effect. For 
background, statin intensity findings may comply with what can be expected. In line with the phase 2 
studies, the treatment effect appears less in case of (increased intensity) statin use compared to less 
or no statin use at baseline. Moreover, this complies with PK/PD modelling data demonstrating statin 
intensity to be a significant factor for LDL-C reduction. In the studies with background statin therapy, 
no obvious differences in effect were observed between the individual different statins. Furthermore, 
for the age subgroups of age categories of < 65, 65 to 75 and ≥ 75 and <85 and ≥ 85 years no 
substantial differences or trends for the difference in effect was noticed, although the number of 
patients in the ≥ 85 years of age group was very limited. 
Ezetimibe 
The efficacy of ezetimibe has sufficiently been described based on literature data including relevant 
placebo controlled randomised studies investigating the lipid lowering effect of ezetimibe as 
monotherapy, in combination with statins, and investigating the effect on CV outcomes. 
FCMP  
Factorial design study on top of statins (study 1002FDC-053) 
An acceptable proportion of patients completed the study (95-96%) and completed the study period on 
study drug (87-90%). The primarily reason for study drug discontinuation was AEs (3.6%-9.2%). In 
general, disposition was approximately comparable between treatment groups allowing for an 
acceptable comparison between treatment groups. In the sensitivity analysis excluding 3 sites, a lower 
number of patients were included in each treatment group (approximately 20% of the patients), 
although dispositions were fairly similar. This should allow for a reasonably acceptable comparison 
between treatment groups for efficacy and safety. 
The study population is at high or very high CV risk with approximately 62% with ASCVD and/ or HeFH 
and represents a Caucasian population at relative increased age (mean age range 62 to 65 years; 
Caucasian 85% to 90%). About half of the patients had diabetes (40-50%). The patient can be 
identified to be hypercholesterolemic with LDL-C baseline levels of mean 150 mg/dL (3.8 mmol/L). 
Despite that patients needed to be on maximum tolerated statin therapy, 25 to 30% did not use any 
statin, and only 30% used high intensity statin. The sensitivity patient population was not substantially 
different from the whole study population, except that the proportion of Latino was lower. The Asian 
population was underrepresented (1%). Randomisation was reasonably successful considering the size 
of the study.  
The FCMP of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe demonstrated a significant difference in LDL-C reduction to 
be substantial in comparison to placebo (-29.0%; p<0.001), and only moderate in comparison to 
ezetimibe (-10.5%; p<0.001) and bempedoic acid (-13.8%; p<0.001). The post-hoc sensitivity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 147/239 
 
 
 
 
analyses excluding the three sites yielded comparable results as the whole study population with 
significant differences of -38.0%, -13.1%, and -19.0%.  Mean absolute changes according to each 
treatment group were -1.3, -0.70, -0.87, and -0.13 mmol/L, with an LDL-C <70 mg/dL at Week 12 of 
27.6%, 9.7%, 7.8%, 1.9%, respectively, assessed as exploratory endpoint. Significant reductions were 
also obtained for other lipids assessed as secondary endpoint including non-HDL-C (-25.4%, -10.9%, -
12.3%), TC (-20.6%, -9.1%, -9.8%), apoB (-21.7%, -6.9%, -8.4%). The effects on hsCRP were less 
clear (-37.2%, -19.0%, -7.2%, last difference non-significant p=0.321).  
Within subgroups of gender, race, age, CV risk category, statin intensity, LDL-C baseline level, history 
of diabetes, and BMI, an approximately similar beneficial treatment effect of the FCMP in comparison 
to placebo, BA and EZE was observed. Slight differences could be due to the small number of patients 
within each subgroup). 
Study in statin intolerant patients as add-on to ezetimibe (study 1002-048) 
A large number of patients completed the study, with more patients in the BA group (97%) than the 
placebo group (92%). Patients who completed the study on study drug was more balanced (90.6% vs 
89.8%). AEs were the main reason for drug discontinuation and slightly higher for BA (7.2%) vs PLB 
(5.7%).  
The study population represents primarily a Caucasian population (85-91%) at relative increased age 
(mean age 64 years) with more female than male patients (61-63%). CV risk estimation was 
performed post-hoc and identified 24% to have ASCVD. Other CV risk factors mentioned is 
hypertension (60 vs 54%), diabetes (19%) and tobacco use (11-13% current and 25-26% former). In 
this study, 27-32% used statins. The patient can be identified to be hypercholesterolemic with LDL-C 
baseline levels of mean 127 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). The Asian population was underrepresented (1.5%). 
Randomisation was reasonably successful considering the size of the study.  
Bempedoic acid demonstrated a significantly larger reduction in LDL-C in comparison to placebo on a 
background of ezetimibe therapy (-23.46% vs 4.99%; -28.35%, p<0.001) with an absolute reduction 
of 0.94 mmol/L. Sensitivity analysis using observed cases and an on-treatment approach supported 
the primary analysis but are considered optimistic. Significant reductions were also obtained for other 
lipids assessed as secondary endpoint including non-HDL-C (-23.56%), TC (-17.99%), apoB (-
19.32%), and hsCRP (-32.5% vs 2.09%). 
Approximately similarly treatment effects were observed for the comparison of bempedoic acid vs 
placebo on top of ezetimibe within subgroups of LDL-C baseline level, history of diabetes, age, race 
and gender. Slight differences could be due to the small number of patients within each subgroup. 
Supportive studies 
The phase 2 study 1002-008 provided additional support for the additional efficacy of the combination 
of bempedoic acid 180 mg QD and ezetimibe (LDL-C difference from baseline -47.7%) in parallel 
comparison to ezetimibe (-21.2%) or bempedoic acid 180 mg QD (-27.5%), although the difference of 
the combination versus ezetimibe was only formally tested (p<0.0001). Of note, in this study, the 
effect of the combination is the sum of the effects of the individual components, in contrast to the 
FDMC study. 
Further, in the 52-week phase 3 studies (1002-040 and 1002-047), as being part of the bempedoic 
acid monotherapy dossier as the pivotal studies, patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy 
provides additional support for the additional effect of bempedoic acid on top of ezetimibe therapy, 
although these data are not stratified and non-randomised for this ezetimibe subgroup; the LDL-C 
reduction was -13.4% (p <0.001) for bempedoic acid vs placebo in patients taking ezetimibe (n=217).

2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Bempedoic acid monocomponent 
Bempedoic acid has demonstrated the capacity to lower the LDL-C, although this effect was only 
moderate and declined with the highest doses of statin background therapy. In the absence of 
background statin therapy the effect of bempedoic acid on LDL-C reduction was larger than with statin 
background therapy. Further, a larger LDL-C lowering effect was observed in females as compared to 
male subjects. The long-term reduction of the LDL-C appeared to slightly diminish, although 
background therapy may have played a role. Bempedoic acid induced increase in statin exposure that 
was of relevance and this significant interaction was appropriately reflected in the SmPC.  
Ezetimibe 
Efficacy data for ezetimibe have sufficiently been described based on literature data. 
FCMP 
On top of statins 
The lipid lowering treatment effect was consistently demonstrated for the FCMP of bempedoic acid and 
ezetimibe in comparison to the placebo and the monocomponents in the factorial design study on top 
of maximum tolerated statins, although the effect was only moderate when the FCMP was compared to 
ezetimibe or bempedoic acid. Apparently, the effect of the FCMP in the FCMP study was not the sum of 
the effects of the monocomponents, although this was observed in the phase 2 study. The lipid 
lowering treatment effect for the combination was further supported by the phase 3 studies of the 
bempedoic acid monocomponent dossier. Subgroup analyses generally showed a consistent effect.  
Statin intolerance 
The LDL-C lowering effect of bempedoic acid on top of ezetimibe background therapy observed in 
statin intolerant patients was substantially higher compared with the effect for the FCMP in comparison 
with ezetimibe which may be explained by the differences in statin background therapy between both 
studies (no or low dose statin therapy vs maximum tolerated statin therapy). This is also in line with 
the difference observed for the bempedoic acid treatment effect between “on top of statin” and “in 
statin intolerance”. Subgroup analyses generally showed consistency in effect.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.1.  Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Patient exposure 
In the bempedoic acid clinical program, 3627 subjects/patients received bempedoic acid, including 383 
healthy subjects, 34 otherwise healthy subjects with hepatic or renal impairment, and 3210 patients 
with hyperlipidemia.  In addition, 1628 subjects/patients participated in clinical studies and did not 
receive bempedoic acid but received placebo and/or other investigational medicinal product. 
In the studies on top of statins (high risk pool) mean days of exposure to IMP was similar between the 
bempedoic acid and placebo groups (308.9 days and 322.4 days, respectively).  Median days of IMP 
exposure was the same for both placebo and bempedoic acid groups (364.0 days).

In the statin intolerant studies, mean days of exposure to IMP was similar between the bempedoic acid 
and placebo groups (117.8 days and 122.4 days, respectively).  Median days of IMP exposure was 
lower for the bempedoic acid group (91.0 days) compared with the placebo group (112.0 days). 
In the ongoing extension Study 1002-050 includes 1462 patients, mean exposure to IMP as of 28 
September 2018 was 318.3 days.

Treatment related adverse events were 24.5% for bempedoic acid and 21.5% for placebo in the 
studies on top of statins (Table 48). The most common treatment related adverse events were myalgia 
(3.1% , 3.7%), muscle spasm (2.2%, 1.3%), diarrhea (1.3%, 1.1%) and headache (1.3%, 1.7%). For 
the statin intolerant studies this was 21.7% vs 14.1% and the most common treatment related 
adverse events were myalgia (3.0% , 3.8%), muscle spasm (2.3%, 1.7%), headache (1.3%, 1.5%), 
blood uric acid increased (1.2%, 0.2%), diarrhea (1.2%, 0.9%), and dizziness (1.1%, 1.1%).   
The most common treatment related adverse events by system organ class (SOC) and for adverse 
events of specific interest are mentioned in the table below. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders were the SOCs with highest frequencies and higher for 
bempedoic acid than the comparator group.

-  New onset diabetes/hyperglycemia 
Based on experience with statins drugs, new onset diabetes/hypoglycemia was analyzed as an adverse 
event of special interest, see tables Table 49and Table 50 below.  This was reported to be 7.1% for 
bempedoic acid vs 8.9% for placebo in patients with diabetes at baseline, and 3.1% vs 4.7% in 
patients without diabetes in the studies on top of statins. This was reported to be 5.1% for bempedoic 
acid vs 9.3% for placebo in patients with diabetes at baseline, and 1.9% vs 2.6% in patients without 
diabetes in the statin intolerant pool.

Hepatic enzyme elevations 
Liver abnormalities were higher for bempedoic acid than for placebo with 2.8% vs 1.3% overall, 2.5% 
vs 1.5% on top of statins, and 3.9% vs 0 in statin-intolerance, mainly due to AST/ALT increases with 
more increased of > 3 x ULN, but no cases of potential Hy’s law (Table 51). No difference in 
hepatobiliary disorders (SOC) was observed in each pool between both treatment arms (2.0% each 
and 0.5% each in both pools, respectively).

Muscular Disorders 
Because statins are associated with muscle-related adverse effects, muscular disorders were evaluated 
as an AESI in Phase 3 clinical studies based on a prespecified list of preferred terms and associated 
changes in CK. Muscular disorders were higher for bempedoic acid vs placebo on top of statins (13.2% 
vs 10.2%). The highest frequency and largest difference in the SOC term musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (Table 53) was observed in low intensity statins (37.6% vs 23.7%), which 
made up 6.1% of the population at baseline. No difference was found for muscular disorders in statin 
intolerance (11.3% vs 11.6%), see Table 52 and Table 53.  
Myositis was reported in 3 patients (0.1%) in Study 1002-040.  One serious adverse event in a patient 
receiving bempedoic acid on a background of 40 mg simvastatin (CK levels were > 10 × ULN ) 
resolved after discontinuation of IMP.  One in a patient receiving 20 mg atorvastatin and one in a 
patient receiving 80 mg atorvastatin were moderate with peak elevations in CK levels were < 3 × ULN 
in these 2 patients. These patients completed the study.

A consistent slight increase in skeletal muscle adverse events is observed for atorvastatin (25.5% 
(287) vs 23.6% (127) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissues; 13.3% vs 9.8% Any Muscular 
Disorders ), rosuvastatin (22.5% (87) vs 21.1% (45); 12.4% vs 8.0%), simvastatin (25.8% (70) vs 
23.7% (32); 12.2% vs 7.4%), and  pravastatin (30.7% (35) vs 21.5% (14); 17.5% vs 15.4%), while 
a lower rate in the BA group was observed for the other statins (n=75). For the largest subgroups the 
increase was seen in atorvastatin 40 mg dose (24.8% (148) vs 19.9% (56); 12.9 (77) vs 7.1% (20)) 
and somewhat in the rosuvastatin 20 mg dose (22.4% (39) vs 23.4% (22); 12.0% (21) vs 7.4 (7)), 
while no increase was seen in the simvastatin 20 mg dose (24.5% (38) vs 31.4% (27); 10.3% (16) vs 
10.5% (9)). For the highest doses only an increase in simvastatin 40 mg dose was observed (22.0% 
(18) vs 5.9% (2); 11.0% (9) vs 2.9% (1)), while no such increase was seen for atorvastatin 80 mg 
(28.1% (47) vs 34.1% (28); 14.4% (24) vs 14.6% (12)) or rosuvastatin 40 mg (16.0% (13) vs 15.4% 
(8); 6.2% (5) vs 5.8% (3)), although these data are limited.

In study 048, adverse events related to muscular safety events occurred in 6.1% of patients in the 
bempedoic acid group, compared with 5.7% in the placebo group. In study 1002-048, Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders was 4 (6.8%) and 1 (4.2%) for bempedoic acid and for placebo in 
patients treated with statins background therapy, and 15 (12.3%) vs 8 (12.7%) for patients on other 
lipid lowering background therapy. 
Neurocognitive disorders 
Based on a possible association between statins and cognitive impairment, neurocognitive disorders 
were evaluated as an AESI in Phase 3 clinical studies using a prespecified list of preferred terms. There 
have been anecdotal reports of cognitive impairment linked to statin use.  However, a meta-analysis of 
statin clinical studies did not demonstrate an increased incidence of cognitive impairment. In the phase 
3 studies comparable low frequencies were observed between treatment arms (0.7% vs 0.8%), Table

Hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis 
Hypoglycemia with associated metabolic acidosis was initially identified as a potential risk based on 
findings in nonclinical toxicology studies of bempedoic acid.  Hypoglycemia was reported with 
comparable frequency (1.7% vs 2.1%), Table 57.

Renal disorders 
Based on nonclinical findings and minimal mean increases in creatinine reported in Phase 1 and Phase 
2 studies, renal disorders were assessed as an AESI in Phase 3 studies, based on a prespecified list of 
adverse event preferred terms and associated laboratory parameters.

Renal disorders were higher for bempedoic acid versus placebo (2.8% vs 1.3%), with difference in 
renal failure (0.8% vs 0.2%), renal impairment (0.5% vs 0.3%), and blood creatinine increased (0.8% 
vs 0.3%), Table 58.

Based on increases in mean serum uric acid levels observed in patients who received bempedoic acid 
in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, uric acid increases were evaluated as an AESI in Phase 3 clinical 
studies based on a prespecified list of preferred terms and associated changes in serum uric acid 
levels. More blood uric acid increased, hyperuricemia and gout was found for bempedoic acid (see 
Table 59).

In the open-label extension Study 1002-050, 13.5% of patients reported a serious adverse event.  The 
most frequent serious adverse events were coronary artery disease (11 patients [0.8%]), angina 
pectoris (9 patients [0.6%]), and unstable angina, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial ischemia

The imbalance in fatal events (safety set) was 19 (0.9%) vs 4 (0.4%) and all occurred within the high 
risk pool (on top of statins). Fourteen bempedoic acid and 4 placebo patients had treatment-emergent 
deaths within 30 days of the last dose of IMP and were adjudicated by a CEC; these deaths were 
adjudicated as CV deaths (10 bempedoic acid, 3 placebo) or non-CV deaths (4 bempedoic acid, 1 
placebo), see MACE events table below; 5 remaining death events (all bempedoic acid) were part of 
the safety population (non-CEC adjudicated) as they were outside the 30 days treatment –emergent 
time frame (but started within this time frame).  
Adjudicated CV deaths (10 vs 3) could be explained by the cardiac disorder SOC in study 040 (5 
(0.3%) vs 0) and study 047 (3 (0.6%) vs 2 (0.8%)), ischaemic cerebral infarction (1 vs 0) and death 
(with unknown origin) (1 vs 1). 
Imbalance in neoplasm SOC were only observed in study 040 (5 (0.3%) vs 0). Of these, 4 cases were 
adjudicated as non-CV death (see MACE events table). Three out of five events occurred within 90 
days of study period. 
Fatality rate was substantially higher in the placebo controlled pool in comparison to the open-label 
extension phase; For the placebo controlled pool this was 0.9 per 100 person-years based on a mean 
exposure of 306 days in 1487 patients for bempedoic acid and was 0.3 per 100 person-years in 742 
placebo patients based on a mean exposure of 319 days. This was 0.5 patients per 100 person-years 
with a mean exposure to bempedoic acid of 456.2 days during the open-label study 050 (second 
interim analysis of Study 1002-050 (15 March 2019)).

In study 050, fatal events were 1 each for myocardial infarction, accidental death, brain death, death, 
b-cell lymphoma, metastatic gastric cancer, fall, haemorrhagic intracranial), with 8 of 9 events not 
considered related to study drug and patients suffered from multiple risk factors that could have 
contributed to the fatal event. 
MACE events 
The number of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events and analyses on hazard ratios are 
provided below in Table 63 and Table 64, and were lower for bempedoic acid (5.0% vs 5.7%).

Discontinuation due to AES 
In the Overall Phase 3 Pool, the most frequent adverse events that led to discontinuation of study drug 
are provided below in Table 71. Also, most frequent adverse events that led to discontinuation 
according to SOC are provided, differentiated for the studies on top of statins and studies in statin 
intolerant patients. More patients on bempedoic acid discontinued due to an AE (11.3% vs 7.8%), 
mostly due to GI disorders (1.5% vs 0.7%) or musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2.8% 
vs 1.9%) on top of statins, Table 72 and Table 73.

2.6.2.  Ezetimibe 
Safety information is presented for ezetimibe monotherapy based on a meta-analysis covering 
8 clinical trials and 2,722 patients (Pandor et al, 2009).  Safety information on the combination of 
ezetimibe and statin therapy is presented based on the large IMPROVE-IT study (Cannon et al, 2015) 
including more than 18,000 patients.  Further safety information is presented based on a meta-
analysis of 27 additional double-blind, placebo-controlled or active comparator studies investigating 
statin monotherapy (atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin) versus ezetimibe 
combination therapy with a statin in more than 20,000 patients.  Treatment durations were between 6 
and 24 weeks.  Thirteen studies evaluated first-line therapy and 14 studies evaluated second-line 
therapy (Toth et al, 2012).  A further meta-analysis (partly overlapping with the above) covering 20 
randomised studies investigated ezetimibe combination therapy with a statin (simvastatin, 
atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin) versus statin monotherapy in almost 
15,000 patients treated for 6 to 12 weeks (Luo et al, 2015).  
Adverse events 
Pandor et al, 2009 present safety data of eight randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical 
trials (all 12 weeks).  In total, 2,722 individuals were included in these studies. In the eight short-term 
studies, ezetimibe monotherapy was found to have a similar adverse event profile to placebo.  Adverse 
events (any) ranged from 53–74% in the ezetimibe monotherapy groups and 54-72% in the placebo 
groups.  Of these, 9–18% in the ezetimibe monotherapy group and 9-24% in the placebo group were 
considered treatment-related (mainly gastrointestinal adverse events or musculoskeletal disorders).  
Clinically important elevations in creatine phosphokinase (≥10 x upper limit of normal) and liver 
enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≥3 x upper limit of normal) were 
not influenced by treatment (<1% in both groups).  Discontinuation rates were comparable between 
both arms and serious adverse events were rare and occurred with similar frequency in the ezetimibe 
monotherapy and placebo groups.  No cases of hepatitis, jaundice, or other clinical signs of liver 
dysfunction were reported and no deaths were attributable to ezetimibe monotherapy in any of the 
included studies.  
In the IMPROVE-IT study (Cannon et al, 2015), involving 18,144 patients treated with either 
ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg (n = 9067; of whom 6% were uptitrated to ezetimibe/simvastatin 
10/80 mg) or simvastatin 40 mg (n = 9077; of whom 27% were uptitrated to simvastatin 80 mg), the 
safety profiles were similar during a median follow-up period of 6.0 years.  Discontinuation rates due to 
adverse experiences were 10.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe/simvastatin and 10.1% for 
patients treated with simvastatin.  The incidence of myopathy was 0.2% for ezetimibe/simvastatin and 
0.1% for simvastatin, where myopathy was defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a 
serum creatinine kinase (CK) ≥10 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or two consecutive observations of CK 
≥5 and <10 x ULN.  The incidence of rhabdomyolysis was 0.1% for ezetimibe/simvastatin and 0.2% 
for simvastatin, where rhabdomyolysis was defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a 
serum CK ≥10 x ULN with evidence of renal injury, ≥5 x ULN and <10 x ULN on two consecutive 
occasions with evidence of renal injury or CK ≥10,000 IU/L without evidence of renal injury.  The 
incidence of consecutive elevations of transaminases (≥3 x ULN) was 2.5% for ezetimibe/simvastatin 
and 2.3% for simvastatin.  Gallbladder-related adverse effects were reported in 3.1% vs 3.5% of 
patients allocated to ezetimibe/simvastatin and simvastatin, respectively.  The incidence of 
cholecystectomy hospitalisations was 1.5% in both treatment groups.  Cancer (defined as any new 
malignancy) was diagnosed during the trial in 9.4% vs 9.5%, respectively.

In the meta-analysis conducted by Toth et al, 2012, study-level data were combined from 27 double-
blind, placebo-controlled or active comparator studies conducted between 1999 and 2008 (Suhop et al, 
2005; Davidson et al, 2002; Gaudiani et al, 2005; Feldman et al, 2004; Ballantyne et al, 2004; Stein 
et al, 2004; Bays et al, 2004; Pearson et al, 2005; Ballantyne et al, 2005; Catapano et al, 2006; 
Goldberg et al, 2006; Conard et al, 2008; Leiter et al, 2008; Robinson et al, 2009; Zieve et al, 2010; 
Kerzner et al, 2003; Melani et al, 2003; Ballantyne et al, 2003; Dobs et al, 2003; Brohet et al, 2005; 
Farnier et al, 2005; Cruz-Fandez et al, 2005; Barrios et al, 2005; Constance et al, 2007; Farnier et al, 
2009; Gagne et al, 2002; Rodney et al, 2006).  In these studies adult hypercholesterolemic patients 
were randomized to statin (atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin) or statin 
plus ezetimibe combination treatment for 6 to 24 weeks with a mean follow up duration of 9 weeks.  
Thirteen studies evaluated first-line therapy and 14 studies evaluated second-line therapy.  A total of 
34% of the patients had CHD at baseline.  In the full cohort, the only significant difference between 
treatments was in consecutive AST or ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN.  Although the incidence (0.35% vs. 
0.56%, statin vs. statin ⁄ ezetimibe) was small in both treatment groups, there were significantly more 
reports of elevations in subjects treated with ezetimibe ⁄ statin therapy (p = 0.017).  Otherwise, both 
treatments had generally similar tolerability and safety profiles, ie, there were no between-treatment 
differences in the proportion of subjects reporting at least 1 AE, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, serious 
drug-related AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, or CK elevations ≥ 10 x ULN. 
Luo et al, 2015 conducted a meta-analysis of 20 randomised clinical trials (Ballantyne et al, 2003; 
Melani et al, 2003; Kerzner et al, 2003; Feldman et al, 2004; Bays et al, 2004; Goldberg et al, 2004; 
Cruz-Fernandez et al, 2005; Barrios et al, 2005; Ballantyne et al, 2005; Farnier et al, 2005; Catapano 
et al, 2006; Zubaid et al, 2008; Conard et al, 2008; Leiter et al, 2008; Robinson et al, 2009; Farnier et 
al, 2009; Foody et al, 2010; Averna et al, 2010; Bays et al, 2011; Hing Ling et al, 2012), that partly 
overlapped with the one from Toth et al, 2012; about 2,000 patients were considered in the 5 studies 
not included in the Toth et al, 2012 meta-analysis.  The analysis included 14,856 patients >18 years of 
age diagnosed with hypercholesterolaemia, whose LDL-C levels were above NCEP ATP III guidelines.  
The studies included comparisons of safety of co-administation of ezetimibe and statins versus statin 
monotherapy and treatment durations between 6 and 12 weeks.  The aim of the meta-analysis was to 
evaluate the evidence associated with the safety of co-administration of ezetimibe with statins.  
A fixed-effects model was used for meta-analysis to assess the safety of combination therapy.  In 
summary, co-administration of ezetimibe and statins did not result in significant increases in total 
adverse events compared with statin monotherapy (30% vs 29%, p = 0.34), serious adverse events 
(2% vs 1.6%, p = 0.81), treatment discontinuations (3.5% vs 2.9%, p = 0.22), gastrointestinal 
adverse events (5% vs 4%, p = 0.08), allergic reactions or rashes (0.9% vs 1.3%, p = 0.33), creatine 
kinase >10 × ULN (0.2% vs 0.2%, p = 0.86), alanine aminotransferase >3 × ULN (0.5% vs 0.4%, p = 
0.96) and aspartate aminotransferase >3 × ULN (0.4% vs 0.4%, p = 0.58).  In conclusion, the 
incidence of adverse events was similar between ezetimibe–statin combination therapy and statin 
monotherapy. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
In the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe for the Treatment of Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study (Rossebø et al, 
2008) cancer occurred more frequently in the ezetimibe/simvastatin group (105 versus 70, p = 0.01).  
The clinical relevance of this observation is uncertain as in the bigger SHARP trial (Baigent et al, 2011) 
the total number of patients with any incident cancer (438 in the ezetimibe/ simvastatin versus 439 
placebo group) did not differ.  In addition, in the IMPROVE-IT trial (Cannon et al, 2015) the total 
number of patients with any new malignancy (853 in the ezetimibe/simvastatin group versus 863 in 
the simvastatin group) did not differ significantly, and therefore, the finding of SEAS trial could not be 
confirmed by SHARP or IMPROVE-IT (see Peto et al, 2008 for a meta-analysis of the 2 trials compared 
to the SEAS trial).  In the registry-based observational follow-up study of the original SEAS study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 178/239 
 
 
 
 
patient population, treatment with ezetimibe/simvastatin was not associated with an increased risk for 
cancer or mortality in the 21-month period after the completion of the original SEAS study (Green et 
al, 2014).  
Alsheikh-Ali et al, 2009 investigated all adverse event reports listing "cancer" or "malignancy" filed 
with the FDA (July 2004 to March 2008) of patients taking ezetimibe or ezetimibe/simvastatin 
combination, and compared those to reports of patients taking simvastatin, atorvastatin, or 
rosuvastatin.   
Prescriptions for all drugs totalled 559 million (approximately 52 and 55 million prescriptions of 
ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin, respectively), and cancer adverse event reports totalled 2334.  
There were 2.9 and 1.3 cancer-associated adverse event reports per million ezetimibe or 
ezetimibe/simvastatin prescriptions, respectively, compared to a range of 3.1 to 5.1 per million 
prescriptions for the other drugs.  The proportions of reports listing cancer relative to all adverse event 
reports were 2.0% and 1.9% for ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin, respectively, compared to a 
range of 1.3% to 3.9% for the other drugs.  In conclusion, this large-scale post-marketing analysis of 
reported adverse events does not support that ezetimibe or ezetimibe/simvastatin increase the risk of 
cancer. 
Serious Adverse Events  
Nußbaumer et al, 2016 conducted a meta-analysis of SAE reporting in 3 randomised (Feldman et al, 
2004; Gaudiani et al, 2005; Cannon et al, 2015; Blazing et al, 2014), controlled trials including 19,068 
patients.  SAEs included death, life-threatening events and events resulting in hospitalisation, 
congenital anomaly or disability or permanent damage.  Under ezetimibe-statin combination therapy, 
38% of the 9628 patients experienced serious adverse events compared with 39% of the 9440 
patients treated with statin monotherapy (RR 1.09 [0.77; 1.55]).  
A further meta-analysis of 20 randomised clinical trials and 14,856 patients, Luo et al, 2015 found SAE 
reporting in 13 trials, with 76 events occurring in 3997 patients (2%) treated with ezetimibe and 
statins, compared with 69 events in 4301 patients (1.6%) treated with statins alone.  This end point 
was not higher with combination therapy compared with statin monotherapy (95% CI, 0.75 – 1.45; p 
= 0.81). 
Deaths 
In the meta-analysis of clinical trials investigating ezetimibe monotherapy, no deaths were attributable 
to ezetimibe monotherapy in any of the included studies (Pandor et al, 2009).   
For ezetimibe combination therapy studies, cardiovascular deaths were usually included in the efficacy 
analyses of clinical studies.  None of the evaluated meta-analyses presented an analysis of deaths for 
ezetimibe combination therapy versus statin monotherapy.  
In the IMPROVE-IT study, no differences between simvastatin monotherapy and combination treatment 
with simvastatin and ezetimibe were detected for deaths.  Death from any cause was reported for 
15.3% and 15.4% of patients receiving monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively.  Hazard 
ratios (95% CI) for death from any cause, cardiovascular deaths, and CHD deaths were 0.99 (0.91–
1.07), 1.00 (0.89–1.13), and 0.96 (0.84–1.09), respectively (Cannon et al, 2015). 
Post marketing experience

With the exception of an investigation of malignancies during post-marketing treatment with 
ezetimibe/simvastatin combination vs. statin monotherapies (Alsheikh-Ali et al, 2009), no summaries 
of post-marketing safety data for ezetimibe treatment were found during the literature search for this 
clinical summary. 
2.6.3.  FCMP  
In the pivotal FCMP study, 382 patients (2:2:2:1 ratio) received study drug for a median exposure of 
84.0 days. Median exposure to IMP (excluding the three sites) was 84.0 days for the FDC, bempedoic 
acid, and ezetimibe treatment groups and 85.0 days for the placebo group. 
In study pivotal study 1002-048 in statin intolerant patients, 268 patients (2:1 ratio) received study 
drug for a median exposure of 84.0 days. 
In the supportive phase 2 study 1002-008, 24 patients received bempedoic acid 180 mg QD+ezetimibe 
(median 77.6 days), 99 patients ezetimibe (79.2 days) and 100 patients bempedoic acid 180 mg QD 
(77.7 days). 
In the supportive phase 3 pool, 150 patients received bempedoic acid and 76 patients placebo on a 
background of ezetimibe. Exposure data are not available.

In the phase 2 study 1002-008, constipation and nasopharyngitis were the most frequently reported 
adverse events in the bempedoic acid 180 mg + ezetimibe group (8.3%) and occurred more frequently 
than in other groups. 
In the phase 3 ezetimibe subgroup analysis, the most frequently reported adverse event in each 
treatment group was nasopharyngitis (14.0% bempedoic acid, 6.6% placebo).  
Adverse events of special interest 
•  Hypoglycemia/metabolic acidosis 
In any of the pivotal studies the numbers were not larger than 1 patients and no metabolic acidosis 
was reported. 
•  New onset diabetes/hyperglycemia

In the supportive phase 3 ezetimibe subgroup analysis, the percentage of patients who had new onset 
diabetes/hyperglycaemia adverse events was similar in patients who received ezetimibe background 
therapy in the bempedoic acid group (2.0%) and the placebo group (6.6%).

•  Hepatic enzyme elevations 
In the FCMP study, hepatic adverse events occurred in 2 patients (2.4%) in the FCMP group, 1 patient 
(1.1%) in the bempedoic acid group, and no patients in the ezetimibe or placebo groups.  This was 
similar in the sensitivity analysis excluding the three sites. 
Further, 2 patients (1.9%) in the FCMP group had an AST value >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), 
neither of these patients demonstrated repeated and confirmed ALT and/or AST levels >3 × ULN that 
had increased from baseline.  No patient had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3 × ULN or 
increased total bilirubin (TB) >2 × ULN, and there were no potential cases that met the criteria for Hy’s 
Law. 
In study 1002-048, hepatic events and liver enzyme abnormalities were more frequent in bempedoic 
acid plus ezetimibe, see tables below.

In the supportive phase 2 study 1002-008, mild increases in AST and ALT were seen in the bempedoic 
acid groups. 
In the supportive phase 3 ezetimibe subgroup analysis, hepatic enzyme elevation were higher for 
bempedoic acid (7 (4.7%) vs 1(1.3%)). 
•  Muscular disorders 
In the FCMP study, muscular disorders were reported as indicated below. Further, 1 patient (0.9%) in 
the ezetimibe group had a single CK level >5 × ULN  that was not confirmed upon repeat assessment.  
No patients in the FCMP, bempedoic acid, or placebo group had a CK level >5 × ULN and there were 
no incidences of CK > 10 × ULN.

In the supportive phase 2 study 1002-008, muscular disorders were reported in 6 patients (6.0%) in 
the bempedoic acid 180 mg group, 12 patients (12.1%) in the ezetimibe group, and 3 patients 
(12.5%) in the bempedoic acid 180 mg + ezetimibe group. 
In the phase 3 ezetimibe subgroup analysis, muscular disorders were 23 (15.3%) for bempedoic acid 
and 11 (14.5%) for placebo. 
•  Neurocognitive disorders 
No adverse events were reported in the pivotal studies. 
•  Renal disorders 
In the FCMP study, renal disorder occurred overall in 4 (3.7%) patients in the FCMP group (3 blood 
creatinine increased, 1 acute kidney injury),  and 2 (1.8%) of patients in the bempedoic acid group (2 
blood creatinine increased), and no patients in the ezetimibe or placebo groups.  The AKI event was 
considered mild and not related to treatment; treatment was continued and the patient recovered.

Mean creatinine increased slightly postbaseline in the FCMP and bempedoic acid groups, with mean 
changes from +0.022 to +0.044 mg/dL (FCMP group) and +0.062 to +0.072 mg/dL (bempedoic acid 
group) by Week 4 and remained stable through Week 12. In the FCMP, bempedoic acid, and ezetimibe 
groups at all timepoints, a larger percentage of patients shifted to a worse eGFR category than to a 
better category.  For example, at Week 12, 17 patients (16.2%) in the FCMP group shifted to a worse 
eGFR category and 7 patients (6.7%) shifted to a better eGFR category.  In the bempedoic acid group, 
18 patients (17.5%) shifted to a worse eGFR category and 8 patients (7.8%) shifted to a better eGFR 
category.  In the ezetimibe group, 12 patients (11.7%) shifted to a worse eGFR category and 6 
patients (5.8%) shifted to a better eGFR category.  In the placebo group, the percentage of patients

who shifted to a worse eGFR category was generally similar to the percentage of patients who shifted 
to a better eGFR category. 
In Study 1002-048, renal disorders occurred in 7 (3.9%) patients (4 GFR decrease, 3 blood creatininen 
increase, 2 renal failure, 1 renal impairment) in the bempedoic acid group, compared with 1 (1.1%) 
(renal failure) patient in the placebo group. Mean creatinine increased slightly postbaseline in the 
bempedoic acid group, with mean percent changes from 3.6% to 4.1%, compared with -0.11% to 
1.1% in the placebo group. Shifts from normal to high (>ULN) creatinine levels occurred in a higher 
proportion of patients in the bempedoic acid group than in the placebo group (at Week 12: bempedoic 
acid, 10.8%; placebo, 6.1%) 
In the supportive phase 3 ezetimibe subgroup analysis, renal disorders were 2 (1.3%) for bemepdoic 
acid and 1 (1.3%) for placebo.

Three patients (2.8%) in the FCMP group (treatment related) and 2 patients (1.8%) in the bempedoic 
acid group (not treatment related) had adverse events of blood uric acid increased. No event of gout 
were reported. 
In study 1002-048, mean uric acid increased slightly increased in the bempedoic acid group, with 
mean percent changes from 8.3% to 9.8%, compared with -0.28% to -2.7% in the placebo group. 
Shifts from normal to high (>ULN) uric acid levels were for bempedoic acid 16.6% and placebo, 7.3%

placebo group (of which 1 [1.1%] treatment related). 
In the supportive phase 2 study 1002-008, a mild increase in mean uric acid from baseline was seen 
with bempedoic acid treatment. 
In the supportive phase 3 ezetimibe subgroup analysis, 2 patients (1.3%) in the bempedoic acid group  
and 1 patient (1.3%) in the placebo group had blood uric acid increased, and 3 (2.0%) vs none had 
gout. 
•  Hemoglobin decreased 
In the FCMP study, mean hemoglobin decreased slightly from baseline in the FCMP and bempedoic acid 
groups, with mean changes of -0.04 to -0.29 g/dL (-0.20% to -2.02%) in the FCMP group, -0.13 
to -0.30 g/dL (-0.92% to -2.04%) in the bempedoic acid group, and +0.03 to +0.06 g/dL (mean 
0.32% to 0.60%) in placebo.  One patient (0.9%) in the FCMP group and no patient in the placebo 
group had decreases in hemoglobin of at least 2 g/dL from baseline and none  with decrease in 
hemoglobin to < 8 g/dL. One patient (0.9%) in the FCMP group and 2 patients (3.6%) in the placebo 
group had adverse events of anemia. 
In study 1002-048, mean hemoglobin decreased slightly from baseline in the bempedoic acid 
group, -0.23 to -0.29 g/dL (-0.47% to 0.51 %) compared with mean increases of 0.06 to 0.07 g/dL 
(1.60% to 1.92%) in the placebo group, 8 patients (4.4%) vs none had decreases in hemoglobin of at 
least 2 g/dL from baseline and no adverse events of anemia were observed.   
In the supportive phase 2 study 1002-008, a mild decrease in hemoglobin was seen with bempedoic 
acid treatment. 
In the supportive phase 3 ezetimibe subgroup analysis, no patients in the bempedoic acid group and 1 
(1.3%) patient in the placebo group had anaemia.

In the supportive phase 3 ezetimibe subgroup analysis,  serious adverse event were 11.3% for 
bempedoic acid, placebo 13.2%.  The most common serious adverse event was angina pectoris (1.3% 
bempedoic acid, 1.3% placebo). 
Deaths 
No patients died in the pivotal studies. One patient died in the phase 2 study 1002-008, and one 
patient on ezetimibe background therapy died in the supportive phase 3 study pool. 
MACE events 
These were not adjudicated in the pivotal studies. 
MACE analyses were also not conducted for the subgroup of patients who received ezetimibe in the 
bempedoic phase 3 studies,. In the overall phase 3 pool, the analysis of 3-, 4-, and 5-component 
MACE demonstrated HRs, analyzed with and without hospitalization for heart failure, yielded HR of 
0.85-1.03 with upper limits of the 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.271 to 1.577. These 
findings have also been discussed in the bempedoic acid monocomponent MAA. 
Laboratory findings 
Specific laboratory findings have already been discussed under specific adverse events. Vital signs, 
including mean heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were essentially unchanged.

Discontinuation due to AES 
In the FCMP study, 7 patients (6.5%), 9 patients (8.2%), 10 patients (9.2%), and 2 patients (3.6%) in 
the FCMP, bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, and placebo groups, discontinued due to an adverse event. In 
the FCMP study excluding the 3 sites, 7 patients (8.2%), 9 patients (10.2%), 10 patients (11.6%), and 
2 patients (4.9%) in the FCMP, bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, and placebo groups, discontinued due to an 
adverse event. 
In study 1002-048, 6.1% of bempedoic acid and 5.7% of placebo discontinued due to an adverse 
event.

Bempedoic acid monocomponent 
Statin intolerance 
In the statin intolerant pool a limited number of 613 were included. In the statin intolerant pool of 
studies 046 (lipid lowering therapy and no or lower than lowest approved dose of statins) and 048 (no 
or low dose statins and study medication of ezetimibe) the median exposure was limited to 91 and 112

days for study treatment and placebo, due to the shorter follow-up period (24 weeks and 12 weeks, 
respectively).  
TEAEs were slightly higher for bempedoic acid compared to placebo (57.3% vs 51.5%) as well as for 
serious AEs (4.6% vs 3.5%, respectively) and treatment related AEs (21.7% vs 14.1%).  
Adverse events were mostly reported in the infection and infestations (15.2% vs 19.2%), and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (17.1% vs 18.7%) categories. The most frequent 
adverse events were urinary tract infections (3.1% vs 7.1%), myalgia (3.4% s 5.1%), and arthralgia 
(4.1% vs 2.5%).  
The frequency of serious AEs was slightly higher (4.6% vs 3.5%). However, these were without 
substantial differences (<0.5% and without meaningful absolute differences in numbers) or any 
notable pattern. Therefore, these data do not allow for any meaningful conclusions. Cardiovascular 
events and deaths are of major interest (see also below in on top of statin discussion). MACE events 
were very rarely observed but higher for bempedoic acid (9 vs 0). This was mainly attributed to 
coronary revascularisation. All patients had a history of ASCVD and thus such events may not be 
unexpected and likely to be imbalanced due to chance finding. Any fatal events were not observed in 
the statin intolerant study pool, which is reassuring.  
Specific attention has been given to reporting on known adverse events from treatment with 
statins including new-onset diabetes/hypoglycaemia, hepatic enzyme elevations, muscular disorders, 
and neurocognitive disorders as discussed below. Further, specific attention was also given to some 
other AEs due to non-clinical findings and findings observed in phase 1 and 2 studies including 
hypoglycaemia (and associated metabolic acidosis), renal disorders, uric acid increases/gout, and 
decreased haemoglobin. 
Although based on limited numbers, there is no sign that treatment with bempedoic acid would 
increase diabetes risk. Worsening of hyperglycemia was reported to be 5.1% for bempedoic acid vs 
9.3% for placebo in patients with diabetes at baseline, and new-onset diabetes was reported to be 
1.9% vs 2.6% in patients without diabetes at baseline. Further support for an absence of an effect on 
diabetes with bempedoic acid comes from data on the changes in HbA1c and fasting glucose, which 
showed no risk of increase or shifts in these parameters for bempedoic acid. Mean change was in HbA1c 
was -0.03% vs 0.20%. No shifts from ≤ 5.5% to ≥ 6.5% were observed and shifts from 5.5%-6.4% to 
≥ 6.5% were lower in bempedoic acid (5.4% vs 11.3%), although shifts from ≤ 5.5% to 5.5%-6.4% 
were higher (6.3% vs 1.9%) based on limited numbers.  
As with statins, laboratory hepatic enzyme elevations were observed with a higher frequency with 
bempedoic acid than placebo (16 (3.9%) vs 0), with AST increased (4 (1.0%) vs 0) and ALT increased 
(4 (1.0% vs 0) being higher. ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN elevation occurred in 5 (1.2%) vs 0, while no 
cases of potential Hy’s Law were observed.  
Muscular disorders were observed at a comparable frequency between bempedoic acid and placebo 
(11.3% vs 11.6%) and for treatment related AEs (7.7% vs 9.1%) and there was an absence of any 
increase according to specific definition of muscular disorders (myalgia, muscle spasm, pain in 
extremity). Although, the highest frequency of discontinuations due to AEs (although generally relative 
low) was in the SOC of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders in the statin intolerant studies 
(25 (6.0%) vs 11 (5.6%)). Levels of > 5x ULN or > 10 x ULN were rarely observed, only for one 
patient treated with bempedoic acid a >5 x ULN was observed.  
Neurocognitive disorders were very rarely observed (2 (0.5%) vs 1 (0.5%)), although this was not 
specifically evaluated. Similarly, adverse events of hypoglycaemia were only observed in one patient 
treated with bempedoic acid.

Similar to phase 1 and 2 study findings, the suggested reversible increase in creatinine effect 
observed in the phase 1 and 2 program can also be observed in the phase 3 studies with difference in 
(mean) change in baseline to week 12 in creatinine of 0.039 vs 0.003, and blood creatinine increased 
(3 (0.7%) vs 0) and GFR decreased (4 (1.0%) vs 0). Further, comparable limited patients (6 patients 
(0.6%) vs 1 patients (0.5%)) dropped below the eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 level. Further, an 
increase in renal disorders was observed for bempedoic acid treatment (10 (2.4%) vs 2 (1.0%)). 
This was consistently observed across some different AEs reported including renal failure (4 (1.0%) vs 
1 (0.5%)), and renal impairment (2 (0.5%) vs 0), but not for acute kidney injury (0 vs 1 (0.5%), 
although data were rare. Treatment related renal disorders and urinary disorders were rarely reported 
(2 (0.5% vs 0). 
As in the phase 1 and 2 studies an increased frequency of uric acid (18 (4.3%) vs 2 (1.0%), 
hyperuricemia (3 (0.7%) vs 0) and gout (4 (1.0%) vs 1 (0.5%)) were observed in the phase 3 studies. 
Treatment related hyperuricemia (2 (0.5%) vs 0), blood uric acid increased (12 (2.9%) vs 1 (0.5%)) 
and gout (1 (0.2%) vs 0) were also systematically higher for bempedoic acid treatment though based 
on limited numbers. 
In the phase 1 and 2 studies, a decrease in haemoglobin was observed. During the phase 3 studies, 
an increased frequency of anaemia (3 (0.7%) vs 0), decreased haemoglobin (1 (0.2%) vs 0) and 
decreased haematocrit (1 (0.2%) vs 0) was observed with bempedoic acid treatment, although cases 
were rare. The level of decrease of haemoglobin was however limited, as this was particularly observed 
for ≥ 2g/dL and < LLN decrease (2.2% vs 0), while higher decreases were more rare (1.2% vs 0 for 
≥ 3g/dL and < LLN, and 0.5% for ≥ 5g/dL and < LLN). 
Bempedoic acid was relatively well tolerated with 13.0% vs 9.1% who discontinued due to an AE. 
The slightly higher discontinuation rate in comparison to the studies on top of statins may be (partly) 
explained by the history of generally less tolerant patients (confounded by indication). The highest 
frequency of discontinuations due to AEs was in the SOC of musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (25 (6.0%) vs 11 (5.6%)). Also, gastrointestinal problems were reported with one of the 
highest frequencies (1.7% vs 0.5%). 
Treatment related AEs were more reported for bempedoic acid than for placebo (21.7% vs 14.1%). 
Apart from the uric acid increased (12 (2.9% vs 1 (0.5%)), no other adverse events definitions clearly 
and substantially contributed to the higher treatment related AEs. 
Incidence of adverse events according to age (18-65, 65 to 75 and over 75 years of age categories) 
did not indicate any increase in AEs with increased age. Number of patients over 85 years of age are 
very limited. A slightly higher incidence of AEs was observed for females (60.3%) than for males 
(53.2%). 
On top of statins 
The studies with statin background therapy were substantially larger (n=3008) than the statin 
intolerant pool (n=613). The studies (040, 047) with background statin therapy had a one year of 
controlled follow-up with a median exposure to study treatment of 364 days. In these studies, 1558 
patients have been treated for more than 48 weeks, which may still be considered limited for an 
intended life-long therapy. Further data will be obtained from the ongoing 1002-050 open-label 
extension study in which 1462 patients have been included from the largest 040 study, with 416 
patients currently treated with bempedoic acid for more than 52 weeks (2 years in total for those on 
bempedoic acid in the 040 study). Also, a cardiovascular outcome study is currently recruiting statin 
intolerant patients who are at increased risk of CV events to obtain an estimated 12600 patients. 
TEAEs were frequently reported, although the number of AEs were approximately similar between 
bempedoic acid and placebo (76.3% vs 76.7%). A consistent slightly higher frequency was also 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 199/239 
 
 
 
 
observed for serious AEs (16.0% vs 15.2%), related AEs (24.5% vs 21.5%), and severe AEs (13.2% 
vs 10.7%), while moderate and mild AEs were approximately similar.  
Adverse events were mostly reported in the infection and infestations (32.8% vs 32.4%), and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (25.5% vs 23.4%) categories. The most frequent 
adverse events were nasopharyngitis (8.6% bempedoic acid, 10.0% placebo), myalgia (5.2% and 
5.3%), urinary tract infection (4.8% and 5.2%, respectively), and arthralgia (4.1% and 5.2%). 
Approximately similar types of AEs in the ongoing open-label study were reported as most frequently 
observed AEs including nasopharyngitis (4.7%), urinary tract infection (3.6%), arthralgia (2.8%), 
dizziness (2.7%), and upper respiratory tract infection (2.3%).  
The frequency of serious AEs was slightly higher for bempedoic acid (16.0% vs 15.2%). The higher 
incidence was likely mainly due to cardiac disorders and most likely as a result of the high 
cardiovascular risk characteristics of these patients. The numbers for each specific individual cardiac 
serious AEs was limited (30 or less) and without substantial differences (<0.5% and without 
meaningful absolute differences in numbers) or any notable pattern. Therefore, these data do not allow 
for any meaningful conclusions. 
Cardiovascular events and deaths are of major interest, as a harmful effect should at least be 
excluded prior to marketing authorisation for a new pharmacological product according to the EMA 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of lipid disorders 
(EMA/CHMP/748108/2013) and the EMA Reflection paper (RP) on assessment of cardiovascular risk of 
medicinal products for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases 
(EMA/CHMP/50549/2015). A lower frequency of independent committee adjudicated MACE events were 
reported for bempedoic versus placebo (120 (5.0%) vs 68 (5.7%)), primarily attributed to a lower 
incidence of nonfatal MI (26 (1.1%) vs 22 (1.8%)) (and coronary revascularization (66 (2.7%) vs 40 
(3.3%)). Although not formally powered, this resulted in a numerical beneficial effect on the 3 
component MACE (CV death, MI, stroke) in the studies on maximum statin background therapy (HR 
0.80 (95%CI 0.491, 1.292) and overall phase 3 studies (HR 0.85 (95%CI 0.529, 1.373; additional 9 
events from the statin intolerant pool included) as well as other MACE definitions (except for those 
including hospitalisation for heart failure (HR 1.03 and 1.01 for 4 MACE + HF and 5 MACE + HF). An 
adequate number of patients was studied to obtain a lower than the 1.8 upper limit of the confidence 
interval mentioned in the above-mentioned RP to reasonably exclude any possible off target risk of 
cardiovascular safety.   
Although the frequency for treatment-emergent fatal adverse events was higher for bempedoic acid 
(n=19; 0.8%) than for placebo (n= 4; 0.3%), the number was very limited with 23 among 3621 
patients, making any conclusions on this imbalance uncertain. Further, this is likely an outlier result as 
this fatality rate was substantially higher than observed in the ongoing single arm open-label study 
(0.9 per 100 person-years based on a mean exposure of 306 days in 1487 bempedoic acid patients 
and 0.3 per 100 person-years in 742 placebo patients based on a mean exposure of 319 days, versus 
0.5 patients per 100 person-years with a mean exposure to bempedoic acid of 456.2 days during the 
open-label study). Furthermore, the imbalance was largely explained by the imbalance in CV events 
(10 (0.5%) vs 3 (0.3%) adjudicated) and likely due to the high CV risk profile of these patients. Of 
note, a lower frequency was observed for bempedoic acid vs placebo in study 047 (3 (0.6%) vs 2 
(0.8%)), although numbers were limited. Further, although an imbalance in the fatal AEs of the SOC of 
Neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) of 5 (0.2%) vs 0 was 
observed, events were very rare and thus any conclusion on this issue remains uncertain. Moreover, 
these are unlikely to be associated with bempedoic acid as 3 out of 5 events occurred within 90 days 
after start of the study. Also, in the ongoing open-label study, any consistent pattern for the 9 fatal 
events with association to study drug could not be observed, which is reassuring.  As already 
Assessment report

mentioned specific attention has been given to reporting on known adverse events from treatment with 
statins AEs due to non-clinical findings and findings observed in phase 1 and 2 studies. 
There is no sign that treatment with bempedoic acid would increase diabetes risk. Worsening of 
hyperglycemia was reported to be 7.1% for bempedoic acid vs 8.9% for placebo in patients with 
diabetes at baseline, and new-onset diabetes was reported to be 3.1% vs 4.7% in patients without 
diabetes at baseline. Further support for a likely absence of an effect on diabetes with bempedoic acid 
comes from data on the changes in HbA1c and fasting glucose, which showed no risk of increase or 
shifts in these parameters for bempedoic acid in both study pools. Mean change was of HbA1c was -
013% vs 0.07%. No shifts from ≤ 5.5% to ≥ 6.5% were observed and shifts from 5.5%-6.4% to 
≥ 6.5% were lower in bempedoic acid (7.2% vs 12.4%) and ≤ 5.5% to 5.5%-6.4% (2.0% vs 2.5%).  
As with statins, laboratory hepatic enzyme elevations were observed with a higher frequency with 
bempedoic acid than placebo (2.5% vs 1.5%), with AST increased (1.3% vs 0.3%) and ALT increased 
(0.9% vs 0.2%). ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN elevation occurring in 13 (0.6%) vs 3 (0.3%) , while no 
cases of potential Hy’s Law were observed. Treatment related hepatic disorders numbers were limited 
but higher for bempedoic acid (3 (0.1%) vs 1 (0.1%)) and with higher frequency for laboratory values 
(ALT increased (0.6% vs 0.1%) and AST increased (0.7% vs 0.1%)).  
Muscular disorders are known to be dose dependently associated with statins. A higher frequency of 
muscular disorders is found for bempedoic acid vs placebo in the patients treated on top of statin 
therapy (13.2% vs 10.2%), while no increase was present in the statin intolerant study pool (see 
above). A bempedoic acid induced increase in exposure of statins by 1.2 to 2 in AUC for the different 
statins as observed in two small dedicated PK studies where a single dose statin dose was added to 
steady state bempedoic acid, could be the main driver of this observation. Due to this increased 
exposure, an amendment in both studies was implemented limiting the dose of (only) simvastatin 
to less than 40 mg. Those patients who were already on 40 mg (n=98) were discontinued treatment. 
Currently, a dose recommendation and warning statement in the SmPC has been proposed to limit the 
simvastatin dose to 20 mg in general, and 40 mg in more high CV risk patients. The low intensity 
statin category showed the highest frequency and highest difference versus placebo in muscular 
disorders (37.6% vs 23.7%; 24.7% vs 24.0%; 24.3 vs 22.5% - low, moderate, high). This may be 
likely explained by possibly relative statin intolerability in these patients with patients likely to be more 
sensitive to muscle disorders upon increased statin exposure induced by concomitant bempedoic acid 
use (confounding by indication). Further, a consistent slight increase in any muscle adverse events is 
observed for atorvastatin (13.3% vs 9.8%, rosuvastatin  12.4% vs 8.0%), simvastatin (12.2% vs 
7.4%), and pravastatin (17.5% vs 15.4%), while a lower rate in the bempedoic acid group was 
observed for the other statins (n=75). An increase in muscle related events was observed in the 
limited subgroup patients on 40 mg simvastatin (muscle disorders 11.0% (n=9) vs 2.8% (n=1); 
musculoskeletal disorders (22.0% (n=18) vs 5.9% (n=2)). Three cases of myositis (0.1%) were 
reported all with statin background therapy, one resolved after discontinuation of study medication, 
while the other 2 non-serious cases in 2 patients continued treatment. Consistent increased levels and 
shifts in CK levels for bempedoic acid were also found. AEs of increased CK levels were higher (1.9% 
vs 1.3%). Although levels of > 5x ULN or > 10 x ULN were rarely observed, a higher frequency for 
bempedoic acid was found compared to placebo (4 (0.2%) and 1 (0.1%)), supporting the increased 
incidence of muscular disorders. Further, a higher incidence was observed in treatment related AEs in 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (7.8% vs 6.9%), although with a less clear pattern for 
the individual related AEs of muscle spasm (2.2% vs 1.3%), pain in extremity (0.7% vs 0.4%), 
myalgia (3.1% vs 3.7%), arthralgia (0.6% vs 1.1%) and blood CK increased (0.7% vs 0.9%). Based 
on these data it is proposed to limit the dose of simvastatin (including a contra-indication for >40 mg 
simvastatin) and include a warning statement for other statins when muscle related events occur.

There was no increased frequency of neurocognitive disorders with the treatment of bempedoic acid 
versus placebo (14 (0.7%) vs 8 (0.8%)), although this has not been specifically investigated. 
In contrast to non-clinical findings, no increased frequency of hypoglycaemia with treatment of 
bempedoic acid was observed in the clinical studies (2.0% vs 2.5%). Also only one patient in each 
randomised group had impaired fasting glucose. 
Similar to phase 1 and 2 study findings, a reversible increase in blood creatinine observed in the 
phase 1 and 2 program can also be observed in the phase 3 studies with difference in (mean) change 
in baseline to week 12 in creatinine of 0.048 vs -0.002, and blood creatinine increased (16 (0.8%) vs 4 
(0.4%)), GFR decreased (12 (0.6%) vs 1 (0.1%)), and blood urea increased (3 (0.1%) vs 1 (0.1%)). 
Also, the proposed mechanism of interference with the renal OAT2 pathway appears not well justified 
(see PK). Further, more patients treated with bempedoic acid (23 patients (1.1%)) vs 6 patients 
(0.6%) dropped below the eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 level. Further, an increase in renal disorders 
was observed for bempedoic acid treatment (2.9% vs 1.3%). This was consistently observed across all 
different AEs reported including renal failure (16 (0.8%) vs 1 (0.1%)), renal impairment (11 (0.5%) vs 
4 (0.4%), and acute kidney injury (6 (0.3%) vs 3 (0.3%)). Treatment related renal disorders and 
urinary disorders were also systematically reported at a higher frequency for bempedoic acid than 
placebo (1.5% vs 0.9%) also on an individual AE level (GFR decrease 0.2% vs 0, renal failure 0.3% vs 
0.1%, but not renal impairment (0.3% vs 0.3%)), although numbers were limited. These findings were 
explained by the creatinine increase effect. For the other events other comorbidities may have been 
involved. 
As in the phase 1 and 2 studies an increased frequency of uric acid (1.6% vs 0.4%), hyperuricemia 
(1.8% vs 0.7%) and gout (1.4% vs 0.4%) were observed. Treatment related hyperuricemia (0.3% vs 
0), blood uric acid increased (0.9% vs 0.1%) and gout (0.2% vs 0) were also systematically higher for 
bempedoic acid treatment though based on limited numbers. 
In the phase 1 and 2 studies a decrease in haemoglobin was observed. During the phase 3 studies, 
especially an increased frequency of anaemia was observed with bempedoic acid treatment (2.8% vs 
1.9%), while decreased haemoglobin (8 (0.4%) vs 3 (0.3%)) or decreased haematocrit (1 vs 0) was 
rarely observed. The level of decrease of haemoglobin was however limited, as this was particularly 
observed for ≥ 2g/dL and < LLN decrease (5.1% vs 2.3%), while higher decreased were more rare 
(1.4% vs 1.3 % for ≥ 3g/dL and < LLN, and 3 (0.1%) vs 2 (0.2%) for ≥ 5g/dL and < LLN). 
Bempedoic acid was relatively well tolerated with 10.9% vs 7.5% who discontinued treatment due to 
an AE. The highest frequency of discontinuations due to AEs was in the SOC of musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (75 (2.8%) vs 19 (1.9%))). Also, gastrointestinal problems (1.5% vs 
0.7%) and cardiac disorders (1.2% vs 0.8%) were reported with one of the highest frequencies. 
Discontinuation due to specific AEs of muscle spasms, diarrhoea, nausea, and pain in extremity were 
more frequent for bempedoic acid. For the open-label phase discontinuations due to AEs were 4.1% 
and occurred less than in the controlled studies. This may indicate better tolerability during longer 
term. 
Treatment related AEs were more reported for bempedoic acid than for placebo (24.5% vs 21.5%). For 
several of the AEs of specific interest frequencies were low and comparable between treatment groups 
including hypoglycaemia, blood glucose increase and diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, haemoglobin 
decreased. While for others including muscular disorders, hepatic disorders and enzyme elevations, 
renal disorders, and uric acid elevations treatment related AEs were systematically increased in line 
with the increased reporting of TEAEs for bempedoic acid. Musculoskeletal disorders and 
gastrointestinal disorders were treatment related adverse event reported at a relatively high frequency 
and were higher for bempedoic acid (7.8% vs 6.9% (on top of statins) and 4.7% vs 3.8% (overall 
study pool)).

Incidence of adverse events according to age has been provided for the 18-65, 65 to 75 and over 75 
years of age categories. Adverse events were slightly higher with increasing age category. Data on 
patients over 85 years of age were very limited. The frequency of AEs was slightly higher in women in 
the studies with statin background therapy, which could be related to the higher exposure.   
Ezetimibe 
The (known) safety profile of ezetimibe has sufficiently been described based on a summary of the 
published data.  
FCMP  
General comments 
The factorial design study 1002FDC-053 compares the safety of the FCMP with the monocomponents 
and placebo treatment and is therefore of relevance. Also, study 048 is of relevance as the safety of 
the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe are compared to ezetimibe in a randomised fashion 
in statin intolerant patients. Further, data on the phase 2 study 1002-008 could be of relevance as the 
combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe is compared to monocomponents, although the data are 
more limited than the phase 3 studies. 
The post-hoc analyses of the phase 3 pool in patients treated on top of statin use is of less relevance 
as data are from a subgroup of patients on a background treatment that included ezetimibe which are 
in principle not randomised. However, these data could provide some insight in longer term use with 
the combination. The post-hoc analyses of the phase 3 pool in statin intolerant patients is not relevant 
as this mainly represents the data of the 048 study, with little data on study 046 as very few patients 
on ezetimibe were included in this study. These data should be separately presented. The data in the 
phase I studies are of limited relevance due to the single-dose administration and in healthy 
volunteers. 
Factorial design study on top of statins (study 1002FDC-053) 
The overall exposure comparing the FCMP of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe with the monocomponents 
and placebo in a randomised fashion are limited both in terms of follow-up with 12 weeks as in terms 
of numbers, since the exposure is limited to 107 FCMP treated patients, 110 bempedoic acid patients, 
109 ezetimibe patients and 55 placebo patients with a mean exposure of 80 days in each group. This 
was 85 FCMP treated patients, 88 bempedoic acid patients, 86 ezetimibe patients and 41 placebo 
patients excluding the three sites. 
Despite the limited number of patients, a slightly higher incidence of AEs and treatment related AEs 
was observed for FCMP (62.4%, 15.3%) and BA (65.9%, 13.6%) in comparison to EZE (54.7%, 
10.5%) or PLB (43.9%, 9.8%). No substantial differences in serious AEs (except versus placebo) and 
discontinuations due to AEs were observed, although data were limited to draw meaningful 
conclusions. The sensitivity analysis excluding the three sites provided a similar pattern. Furthermore, 
the study is too small to differentiate for any possible patterns on individual AEs. Urinary tract infection 
(5.9%, 3.4%, 2.3%, 2.4%), nasopharyngitis (4.7%, 6.8%, 4.7%, 0%), constipation (4.7%, 0, 2.3%, 
0), back pain (3.5%, 3.4%, 2.3%, 4.9%) and hypertension (3.5%, 5.7%, 2.3%, 0) were the most 
frequently observed AEs. 
Relative low proportions of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs (7 (8.2%) FCMP, 9 (10.2%) BA, 
10 (11.6%) EZE, and 2 (4.9%) PLB), without any clear differences between study groups except for 
placebo. Absolute numbers on a single AE level ranged from 1 to 3 not allowing for any conclusions.

Also limited numbers of serious AEs were observed with 8 patients (9.4%) in FCMP, 7 (8.0%) in BA, 10 
(9.5%) in EZE, and 1 patient (2.4%) in PLB; all occurred at similar frequency across the treatment 
groups (except for placebo). None were considered related to study medication. Most of these serious 
AEs were cardiac disorders (14) and infections and infestations (4). Most of the AEs reported only 1 on 
a single level definition of the AEs not allowing to observe any particular pattern. 
Specific attention has been given to reporting on known adverse events from treatment with statins 
including new-onset diabetes/hyperglycaemia, hepatic enzyme elevations, muscular disorders, and 
neurocognitive disorders as discussed below. Further, specific attention was also given to some other 
AEs due to non-clinical findings and findings observed in phase 1 and 2 studies including 
hypoglycaemia (and associated metabolic acidosis), renal disorders, uric acid increases/gout, and 
decreased haemoglobin. In general, the numbers according to single adverse events definitions were 
limited complicating interpretation of the data.   
For new-onset diabetes, very limited data reported a slightly higher incidence of new-onset or 
worsening of DM with the FCMP (4 (4.7%) FCMP, 1 (1.1%) BA, 2 (2.3%) EZE and 0 PLB), not allowing 
for any conclusions. A comparable pattern could be observed for fasting glucose in patients with a 
history of diabetes but not for patients without a history of diabetes.  For hepatic abnormalities, 3 
hepatic events occurred (2 (2.4%) in the FCMP and 1 (1.1%) in the BA group). In contrast to an 
increased frequency of muscular disorders with bempedoic acid when given on top of statins, these 
were reported with approximately similar frequency between treatment groups in this study, although 
numbers were limited (6 (7.1%) FCMP, 7 (8.0%) BA, 7 (8.1%) EZE, and 3 (7.3%) PLB).  Renal 
disorders were slightly higher for FCMP and BA, although numbers were very limited (4 (4.7%) FCMP, 
2 (1.1%) BA, 0 EZE, and 0 PLB). The mean creatinine levels slightly increased during the start of 
therapy for FCMP and BA compared to EZE and PLB. Moreover, more patients shifted to a worse eGFR 
category (17 (16%) FCMP, 18 (17%) BA, 12 (11.7%) EZE, 3 (5.4%) PLB). A slightly higher mean 
change in uric acid levels was observed (approximately 0.5 mg/dL) resulting in slightly higher mean % 
change for FCMP (11.8%) and BA (16.1%) versus EZE (1.5%) and PLB (-1.3%) and higher abnormal 
uric acid levels from 4 weeks onward (40 (37%), 47 (42%), 19 (17%) and 9 (16%)) with 3 patients 
(3.5%) in the FCMP group and 1 patient (1.1%) in the bempedoic acid group experienced adverse 
events of blood uric acid increased of which 2 events in the FCMP were considered treatment related. 
No AEs of gout were reported. Furthermore, no events of neurocognitive disorders were reported.  
Mean haemoglobin decreased slightly with the FCMP (-0.31 g /dL) and BA (-0.28) compared to EZE (-
0.11) and PLB (0.15) at week 12. AEs of haemoglobin decreased and anaemia were very limited. 
No meaningful differences in vital signs, including hypertension, were observed in this study. 
A slightly higher incidence of AEs was found for females than for males across all the treatment 
groups. Only data for the difference between < and >65 years of age have been provided, not 
indicating substantial differences in AE frequency between these categories. Data on the age 
categories according to <65 years, 65-74, 75-84 and >85 years of age have been provided but are too 
limited to draw meaningful conclusions. 
Study in statin intolerant patients as add-on to ezetimibe (study 1002-048)  
In study 048 in statin intolerant patients, the exposure is rather limited, as 181 patients were exposed 
to the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe and 87 patients on ezetimibe in a randomised 
fashion for 12 weeks.  
A (slightly) higher incidence of AEs and treatment related AEs with BA (48.6%, 21.5%) versus placebo 
(44.8%, 9.2%) was observed, while numbers in serious AEs (total 8) and discontinuation due to AEs 
(10) were too limited to draw any meaningful conclusions. Although numbers were limited, a higher 
incidence of blood uric increased (14 (7.7%) vs 2 (2.3%)), headache (8 (4.4%) vs 3 (3.4%)), and liver

function test increased (7 (3.9%) vs 0) were most frequently observed and higher for BA versus PLB. 
These were also reported most frequently and with a higher incidence for BA as treatment related AEs. 
Relative low proportions of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs and comparable between BA 
and PLB (11 (6.1%) vs 5 (5.7%)). Absolute numbers on a single AE level were not larger than 1, not 
allowing for any conclusions. 
Five patients (2.8%) in BA and 3 patients (3.4%) in PLB experienced serious AEs, limiting 
interpretation for any potential treatment difference. None were considered related to study 
medication. No deaths were reported. 
With regard to AEs of specific interest, no differences were found for new-onset or worsening DM (6 
(3.3%) BA vs 3 (3.4%) PLB), but this was based on very limited data. Some difference could be 
observed for high levels of fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL in patients with a history of diabetes (19 
(54%) vs 12 (70%) but this was in contrast to  patients without a history of diabetes (12 (8.2%) vs 1 
(1.4%)), while HbA1C was comparable. A higher percentage of 13 (7.2%) hepatic events in BA vs 0 in 
PLB occurred, all which can be notified as liver enzyme elevations, 5 with > 3 x ULN in ALT, 1 >5 x 
ULN in ALT and 5 > 3 x ULN in AST and none with potential Hy’s law. For muscular disorders, a slightly 
higher incidence for BA was observed compared to PLB (11(6.1%) vs 5 (5.7%)) and CK increases (3 
(1.7%) vs 0). For renal disorders, a slightly higher incidence for BA was observed (7(3.9%) vs 1 
(1.1%)), but numbers were very limited. The mean creatinine levels slightly increased during the start 
of therapy for BA compared to PLB. Likewise, more patients shifted from mild to moderate eGFR 
category (19 (11%) BA, 5 (6.2%) PLB at week 12). Increases in uric acid were observed for BA vs PLB 
(0.54 mg/dL vs -0.28 mg/dL), shifts in uric acid, and AEs of blood uric acid increased (10 (5.5%) vs 2 
(2.3%)), however, no gout AEs were reported. Furthermore, no events of neurocognitive disorders 
were reported.  
No meaningful differences in vital signs, including hypertension, were observed in this study. 
Safety data according to subgroups do not show meaningful differences. 
Phase 2 study 1002-008 and post-hoc analysis of the phase 3 pool  
Although data are limited, the phase 2 study 1002-008 could be of relevance as the combination of 
bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mgQD were received by 24 patients compared to 100 
patients on bempedoic acid 180 mg QD and 99 patients on ezetimibe 10 mg treated for approximately 
78 days. For longer term exposure, only data of 150 bempedoic acid treated patients and 76 placebo 
patients in the subgroup of patients with background ezetimibe use are available from the post-hoc 
analyses of the 52 weeks phase 3 pool in patients treated on top of statin use. Further, some patients 
in the 24 weeks 046 study in statin intolerant patients used ezetimibe as background therapy resulting 
in 34 patients treated with bempedoic acid with ezetimibe background therapy and 15 patients on 
ezetimibe background therapy. Specific data on this 046 study according to ezetimibe use are too 
limited to draw conclusions on. Further, these subgroups were not randomised, therefore the 
comparison of these data should be taken with caution.  
In the phase 2 study, a higher incidence of AEs and treatment related AEs with BA/EZE (70.8%, 
41.7%) was observed in comparison to BA (55.0%, 18.0%) as well as EZE (53.5%, 19.2%), although 
only 24 patients were treated with the combination including the dose of 180 mg QD. Contrasting 
results were observed for the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies in patients 
with background statin therapy showing less AEs with BA (78.7%) versus placebo (90.8%), and similar 
incidence in treatment related AEs (24.0% vs 23.7%). Also, discontinuation due to AEs was lower for 
BA (n=12, 8.0%) versus placebo (n=9, 11.8%), although numbers were limited. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 205/239 
 
 
 
 
In the phase 2 study, numbers were limited not allowing for any clear patterns in individual AEs. 
Constipation (2 (8.3%) BA/EZE, 1 (1.0%) BA and 1 (1.0%) EZE) and nasopharyngitis (2 (8.3%), 5 
(5.0%) and 4 (4.0%)) were most frequently reported. In the ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 
3 studies in patients with background statin therapy the most frequently observed AEs observed to be 
higher for BA vs PLB (on a background of EZE) were nasopharyngitis  (21 (14.0%) vs 5 (6.6%)), upper 
respiratory tract infection (5.3% vs 2.6%), bronchitis (4.0% vs 1.3%), gastroenteritis (2.7% vs 0) and 
blood CK increased (3.7% vs 0), although data for some of these AEs were also limited. 
In the phase 2 study, relatively low proportions of patients discontinued treatment (1 (4.2%) BA/EZE, 
6 (6.0%), 8 (8.1%) EZE) with relative low absolute numbers which do not allow for any conclusions. 
For the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies in patients with background statin 
therapy, discontinuations rates due to AEs were relatively low and comparable (8.0% vs 11.0%). 
The 4 cases of serious AEs in the phase 2 study are also too limited to draw any conclusions. For the 
post-hoc non-randomised data of pooled phase 3 studies in patients with background statin therapy, 
frequencies of serious AEs across treatment groups are comparable (11.3% BA, 13.2% PLB).  The 
overall number of deaths was very limited with one in the phase 2 study and one in the ezetimibe 
subgroup of the phase 3 studies. Likewise, for these datasets it was not useful to analyse for MACE 
events. 
With regards to AE of specific interest, for the ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies in 
patients with background statin therapy, new onset diabetes was observed in 8 patients total. These 
data do not indicate a clear pattern for the risk of diabetes, although the number was too limited to 
allow for meaningful conclusions. In the phase 2 study 008, events of liver enzyme increases were 
very rare and observed in 10 patients in total across the different treatment groups. For the post-hoc 
ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies in patients with background statin therapy, hepatic 
enzyme elevation were rarely noticed but with a higher incidence for BA (7 (4.7%) vs 1(1.3%)). In the 
phase 2 study, muscle related AEs were also slightly higher for BA/EZE (3(12.5%) vs BA (6 (6.0%)) 
but comparable to EZE (12 (12.1%)). For the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup of pooled phase 3 studies 
in patients with background statin therapy, muscular disorders were only slightly higher for BA (23 
(15.3%) vs 11 (14.5%)). Myalgia was mostly reported, but with a higher frequency in PLB (11 (7.3%) 
vs 9 (11.8%)). Across the different studies, no clear pattern of increased muscle related disorders for 
the bempedoic acid ezetimibe combination could be observed, although the limited numbers do not 
allow for meaningful conclusions. In the phase 2 study, renal disorders were not specifically 
investigated, and were very rarely observed. Also, for the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled 
phase 3 studies in patients with background statin therapy, renal disorders were very rare (n=3), not 
allowing for any conclusions. For the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies in 
patients with background statin therapy, only 3 events of uric acid increase were observed. Very 
limited numbers of neurocognitive disorders were reported, only in the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup 
data of pooled phase 3 studies (0.3% and 1.1% BA and PLB), not allowing for any firm conclusions.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Bempedoic acid monocomponent 
As it has been evaluated in a relatively limited database of statin intolerant patients, bempedoic 
acid was well tolerated although some specific side effects occurred including an increase in uric acid 
with a risk of gout, increase in serum creatinine and decrease in haemoglobin with a risk of anaemia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 206/239 
 
 
 
 
Also, some side effects known from statin use were seen also with bempedoic acid including an 
increase in liver enzymes and renal disorders.  
The safety profile was also characterised in the much larger database of patients treated on top of 
maximum tolerated statin therapy. An increased incidence of muscle disorders was seen when used 
on top of statins. This was likely driven by the increase in exposure of statin that was induced by 
bempedoic acid as identified in two dedicated PK studies. With the available numbers, CV harm can 
currently be excluded in accordance with the requirements detailed in the Reflection paper on 
assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products [EMA/CHMP/50549/2015]. The 
imbalance found in the very limited number of MACE events in the statin intolerant pool is likely a 
chance finding in association with the high baseline risk of the patients. The slight imbalance in fatal 
events is likely to be an outlier result not supported by any clear pattern in reasons for fatality. 
Overall, the clinical database is sufficient to characterise the safety profile of bempedoic acid although 
long term data is still limited and will be provided post-authorisation.  
The ongoing long term CVOT study (Study 1002-043) in 12600 statin intolerant patients treated for 
3.5 years should provide further data regarding impact of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality.  
Ezetimibe 
The (known) safety profile of ezetimibe has sufficiently been described based on a summary of the 
published data.  
FCMP 
On top of statins 
The clinical safety database of the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe is limited in terms of 
the number of patients and follow up time, especially for the randomised data comparing the 
combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe to the monocomponents or placebo. Overall, (treatment 
related) adverse events were higher with the use of the combination or bempedoic acid in comparison 
to ezetimibe or placebo. Moreover, similar to the bempedoic acid component, specific bempedoic acid 
induced effects of increase in uric acid, increase in serum creatinine, slightly increased in frequency of 
renal disorders and increase in liver enzymes were observed. No other particular pattern in adverse 
events could be observed likely due to the limited database. Some non-randomised data on long term 
use of the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe comes from the subgroup of ezetimibe 
background treated patients in the pivotal phase 3 studies of the monocomponent dossier. These data 
are generally in line with the observations of the FCMP study. 
Statin intolerance 
The clinical safety database of the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe as compared to 
ezetimibe background therapy is also limited in terms of the number of patients and follow up time. 
Generally, these data generally display similar results as for the combined use of bempedoic acid and 
ezetimibe on top of statin therapy. Although, conclusions are generally difficult to draw based on the 
observed data. Therefore, reliance on the safety profile of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe 
monocomponents is also warranted.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of bempedoic acid / ezetimibe with active substances contained 
in authorised medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, 
isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers bempedoic acid / ezetimibe to be a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary hypercholesterolemia by definition is any hypercholesterolemia which is caused by a 
disorder (either familial- or nonfamilial) in lipid metabolism and is not caused by another condition, 
such as hypothyroidism, or a drug effect. The heterozygous familial form of this condition (HeFH) is 
more rare and is estimated to occur between 1:200 and 1:500 individuals globally. LDL-C levels in 
affected individuals are elevated, and in spite of aggressive statin use, there is still a 2-fold excess of 
CHD-related deaths relative to age-matched controls within this population. 
Hyperlipidemia is the heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an excess of lipids (ie, 
cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides) in the bloodstream. Hypercholesterolemia, specifically refers 
to the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Primary hyperlipidemia is usually due to 
genetic causes (monogenetic or polygenetic) and environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle. 
Primary nonfamilial hyperlipidemia is hyperlipidemia that is not due to a specific genetic disorder, 
although there are polygenetic influences. Mixed dyslipidemia is generally defined as elevated LDL-C 
and high triglycerides and/or low HDL-C. 
A large body of epidemiological evidence exists demonstrating a strong positive correlation and causal 
relationship between LDL-C levels and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Other clinical 
manifestations of atherosclerosis also appear linked to LDL-C levels such as cerebrovascular disease 
(i.e. stroke) or peripheral vascular disease. In addition, clinical trials have shown that LDL-C lowering 
therapy especially with statins reduces risk for CHD. The relationship between LDL-C levels and CHD 
risk holds over a broad range of LDL levels. Epidemiologic data indicate a continuous increasing 
relative risk from very low to “normal” and high levels of LDL-C, but with higher absolute risk in 
patients at the higher end of LDL-C levels. 
Bempedoic acid is an oral small molecule that is activated in the liver to ETC-1002-Coenzyme A 
(ETC-1002-CoA), which subsequently inhibits adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme 
upstream of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol 
synthesis pathway. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis triggers the upregulation of low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) expression in the liver resulting in increased clearance of LDL 
particles and lowering of LDL-C in the blood. Additionally, inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in 
concomitant suppression of hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of 
the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol via the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick 
C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This 
causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in LDL receptors, resulting in clearance 
of cholesterol from the blood. This distinct mechanism is complementary to that of bempedoic acid.   
The proposed indication for bempedoic acid with ezetimibe fixed combination medicinal 
product (FCMP) was the following: 
Treatment in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or 
mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated 
dose of a statin alone, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 213/239 
 
 
 
 
• 
in combination with a statin in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated 
dose of a statin in addition to bempedoic acid or ezetimibe, 
•  alone in patients who are either statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated, 
•  alone in patients who are either statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated, and are 
unable to reach LDL-C goals with bempedoic acid alone or ezetimibe alone, 
• 
in patients already being treated with the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe as 
separate tablets with or without statin. 
The FCMP contains ezetimibe and bempedoic acid.  Ezetimibe 10 mg has been shown to reduce the 
frequency of cardiovascular events.  The effect of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality has not been determined. 
Elevated cholesterol as indicated by definitions of hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and 
non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Lowering LDL-C has 
been accepted as a surrogate endpoint for the reduction of CV events. 
The proposed indication statement covered the three therapeutic scenarios described in the “Guideline 
on clinical development of fixed combination medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/158268/2017)”: 
• 
‘’first line indication’’ after statins 
o 
in combination with a statin in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum 
tolerated dose of a statin alone;  
o  alone in patients who are either statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is 
contraindicated),  
•  add-on indications either to non-responders of bempedoic acid or ezetimibe  
o 
in combination with a statin in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum 
tolerated dose of a statin in addition to bempedoic acid or ezetimibe;  
o  alone in patients who are either statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is 
contraindicated, and are unable to reach LDL-C goals with bempedoic acid alone or 
ezetimibe alone),  
• 
substitution indication  
o 
in patients already being treated with the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe 
as separate tablets with or without statin. 
The Fixed Combination Medicinal Product (FCMP), administered as a single tablet, is intended to 
facilitate the correct use of the medicine in terms of daily dosing to improve overall patient 
adherence. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Statins are the cornerstone therapy for patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous 
familial and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet to reduce low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C).  Statins have robustly demonstrated CV benefits in patients at increased CV risk. 
Clinical guidelines strongly recommend the use of statins in patients with elevated LDL-C levels. If 
baseline levels are between 1.8 mmol/L and 3.5 mmol/L (70 mg/dL and 135 mg/dL) then treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 214/239 
 
 
 
 
aims are to reduce LDL-C levels  below 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or at least reduce LDL-C by 50%. In 
patients at very high-risk of CV events, a need exists for additional therapies for LDL-C lowering and 
CVD prevention, because some patients who are already receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a 
statin or have limitations in statin tolerability and are not reaching LDL-C goals. It is well known that 
patients may experience statin-associated adverse effects (e.g. muscular adverse effects) that limit 
their ability to take a statin or a high enough dose of statin to reach their LDL-C goal. Statin-intolerant 
patients are at higher risk of not achieving target LDL-C levels appropriate to their level of CV risk 
given that non-statin therapies, other than PCSK9 inhibitors, typically provide only about a 15-20% 
reduction in LDL-C. 
Ezetimibe could provide additional LDL-C lowering and is indicated in adults with primary 
hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to 
diet to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), in combination with a statin or statin with 
other lipid lowering therapies when additional LDL-C lowering is needed (according to learned society 
guidelines as mentioned).  Moreover, ezetimibe is indicated in patients alone or in combination with 
other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or in patients for whom a statin is 
not considered clinically appropriate or contraindicated. In clinical guidelines ezetimibe is 
recommended to be used as second-line therapy in association with statins when the therapeutic goal 
is not achieved at the maximal tolerated statin dose or in patients intolerant to statins or with 
contraindications to these drugs. These recommendations are based on the demonstrated CV benefit of 
ezetimibe in the IMPROVE-IT trial, even if the absolute CV benefit from adding ezetimibe was limited in 
line with its modest effect. 
Other available therapies could include PCSK9 inhibitors which have shown very effective LDL-C 
lowering effect and are indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial 
and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet to reduce low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C), in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies when 
additional LDL-C lowering is needed (according to learned society guidelines as mentioned). PCSK9 
inhibitors have also demonstrated CV benefit in established cardiovascular disease. PCSK9 inhibitors 
are, however, not widely used (<5% of lipid lowering treatment) which may be (partly) due to these 
products being relatively new and primarily pricing and reimbursement issues. Further, PCSK9 
inhibitors should be administered by injection (every 2 or 4 weeks) instead of orally, which may either 
be perceived as an advantage or a limitation depending on the patient's preferences.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Statin intolerance 
The Phase 3 program included 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies 
in patients with hyperlipidemia who are at risk of CV disease and were SI (used no or low dose of 
statins): 
•  Study 1002-046 (n=345): a 24 weeks randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid (etc-1002) 180 mg compared to placebo 
added to background lipid-modifying therapy in patients with elevated ldl-c who are SI 
•  Study 1002-048 (n= 269): a 12 weeks randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid (etc-1002) as add-
on to ezetimibe therapy in patients with elevated ldl-c on low-dose or less than low-dose statins

On top of statins 
The Phase 3 program included 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies 
in patients with hyperlipidemia who are at risk of CV disease on top of maximum tolerated statin 
therapy: 
•  Study 1002-047 (n= 779): a 52 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
study to evaluate the efficacy of bempedoic acid (etc-1002) in patients with hyperlipidemia at high 
cardiovascular risk not adequately controlled by their lipid-modifying therapy. 
•  Study 1002-040 (n= 2230): a 52 weeks randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicentered long-term safety and tolerability study of etc-1002 in patients with hyperlipidemia at 
high cardiovascular risk who are not adequately controlled by their lipid-modifying therapy. 
•  One Phase 3 OLE study (Study 1002-050) assessing 1 year safety and efficacy is ongoing.  This 
document includes interim data for 1462 enrolled patients from study 1002-040 based on a last 
patient visit of 28 September 2018.  
FCMP  
The main studies in which the combination of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe was compared in a 
randomised fashion to the monocomponents were the following phase 3 studies: 
On top of statins 
•  Study 1002FDC-053: A phase 3 factorial design pivotal 4-arm (2:2:2:1) Phase 3 (n=382), 
randomized, 12-week, controlled study comparing the Fixed Combination Medicinal Product 
(BA+ezetimibe) with bempedoic acid alone, ezetimibe alone, and placebo as add on to stable, 
maximally-tolerated statin therapy. 
Statin intolerance 
•  Study 1002-048: a phase 3 randomized, controlled bempedoic acid study (n=269) that compared 
bempedoic acid with placebo as add-on therapy to ezetimibe (and no or no more than low doses of 
statins) for 12 weeks.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Study 1002FDC-034: a phase 1, randomised, open-label, single-dose, 3-period crossover study in 
healthy subjects including 6 treatment sequences in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, to compare the oral 
bioavailability of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe with two different formulations of the FCMP  to the 
bioavailability of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe with 1 bempedoic acid 180 mg tablet and 1 ezetimibe 
10 mg tablet coadministered. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Statin intolerance 
Bempedoic acid at a dose of 180 mg/day demonstrated a significant placebo-corrected reduction at 
12 weeks in LDL-C from baseline of approximately -21% to -28%  in patients using no statin or very 
low to low doses of statins, and/or using other lipid lowering therapy.  The patients in these trials had 
baseline LDL-C levels between 3.2 – 4.1 mmol/L. Efficacy was supported by significant and beneficial 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 216/239 
 
 
 
 
changes in other relevant parameters of the cholesterol profile, i.e. non-HDL (-17% to -24%), 
TC (-15%) and ApoB (-15% to -19%). 
The LDL-C effect of bempedoic acid was consistent across several subgroups, i.e. age, race, gender, 
ethnicity, region, history of diabetes, baseline BMI, baseline LDL-C, ezetimibe use, and baseline GFR 
category. 
On top of statins 
Bempedoic acid at a dose of 180 mg/day demonstrated a modest placebo-corrected reduction at 12 
weeks in LDL-C from baseline of -17% to -18% on top of maximum tolerated statin background 
therapy (2010 patients on bempedoic acid and 999 patients on placebo, respectively). The patients in 
these trials had baseline LDL-C levels between 2.6-3.2 mmol/L. Patients were at high to very high CV 
risk based on their established cardiovascular disease or equivalent CV risk estimation, or presence of 
HeFH and eligible for (additional) lipid lowering therapy according to learned societies guidelines 
criteria (ESC, AHA). Efficacy was supported by significant and beneficial changes in other relevant 
parameters of the cholesterol profile, i.e. non-HDL (-13%), TC (-11%) and ApoB (-12% to -13%). 
The LDL-C effect of bempedoic acid was consistent across several subgroups, i.e. age, race, 
ethnicity, region, history of diabetes, baseline LDL-C, HeFH status, prior ASCVD, ezetimibe use, 
baseline GFR category.  
A sustained effect of LDL-C reduction has been demonstrated up to 52 weeks in the 2 placebo 
controlled studies on top of statin therapy, although the effect slightly diminished over time in the 
ongoing open label long term study including patients from the largest controlled study 040 on top 
of statin therapy. The LDL-C lowering treatment effect resulted in significantly more patients reaching 
the LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L goal (28.9% vs 8.0% at week 12 and 26.2% vs 9.1% at week 52 on top of 
statins). 
Ezetimibe 
The efficacy of ezetimibe has been described based on literature data including relevant placebo 
controlled randomised studies investigating the lipid lowering effect of ezetimibe as monotherapy, in 
combination with statins, and investigating the effect on CV outcomes. 
FCMP  
Factorial data on top of statins  
The FCMP of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe demonstrated a significant reduction in LDL-C in 
comparison to placebo (-38.0%), and a moderate reduction in comparison to ezetimibe (-13.1%) or 
bempedoic acid (-19.0%) in the primary analysis of mean percent change in LDL-C after 12 weeks of 
treatment in high CV risk patients with mean baseline LDL-C of 3.85 mmol/L on top of statins . This 
translated into 31.3%, 10.0%, 6.1%, and 0% of the patients meeting the LDL-C < 70 mg/dL 
treatment goal, in the BA+ezetimibe, ezetimibe, BA and placebo groups respectively. Efficacy was 
supported by significant and beneficial changes in other relevant parameters of the cholesterol profile, 
i.e. non-HDL-C (-33.7%, -12.1%, -17.8%), TC (-27.1%, -10.4%, -14.2%), and apoB (-30.1%, -9.3%, 
-12.8%).  
The LDL-C effect of the FCMP of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe was consistent in several subgroups 
of gender, race, age, CV risk category, statin intensity, LDL-C baseline level, history of diabetes, and 
BMI in comparison to placebo, bempedoic acid and ezetimibe.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 217/239 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A small phase 2 study and data from the subgroup of patients on ezetimibe background therapy from 
other phase 3 studies in patients treated with maximum tolerated statin therapy provided additional 
support for these findings. 
Add-on to ezetimibe in statin intolerance  
For statin intolerant patients, bempedoic acid demonstrated a significant reduction in LDL-C in 
comparison to placebo (-29%) on top of study supplied ezetimibe treatment, in the primary analysis of 
mean percent change in LDL-C after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with mean baseline LDL-C of 
3.3 mmol/L. Efficacy was supported by significant and beneficial changes in other relevant parameters 
of the cholesterol profile, i.e. non-HDL-C (-23.6%), TC (-18.0%), apoB (-19.3%). Also an effect on 
hsCRP was observed (-32.5% vs 2.09%).  
The effect was consistent in several subgroups of gender, race, age, LDL-C baseline level, and 
history of diabetes.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Statin intolerance 
Bempedoic acid has demonstrated to reduce LDL-C level, an established surrogate marker for CV 
disease, but its impact on clinical outcomes has not been formally tested yet. MACE events were 
very rarely observed. Although this was higher for bempedoic acid (9 vs 0; mainly attributed to 
coronary revascularisation), all patients had a history of ASCVD and thus such events may not be 
unexpected and likely to be imbalanced due to chance finding. This does not likely meet the 
requirement of the upper limit of the CI to be below 1.8 which could exclude any sign of CV harm 
(Reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products 
[EMA/CHMP/50549/2015]. However, this requirement was met for the overall phase 3 program.  
Maintenance of effect has not been demonstrated. The phase 3 studies were only 12 weeks and 24 
weeks. Moreover, only patients from the studies on top of statins have been enrolled in the ongoing 
long term open label study. 
Differences in efficacy were noted in some subgroup analyses including ethnicity, and (low dose) 
statin. The use of background low statin dose showed smaller reductions in LDL-C than patients not 
using any statin (p for interaction 0.032). Furthermore, subgroup analyses were presented across the 
following age categories of < 65 years, 65 to 75 and ≥ 75 with no substantial differences in effects 
observed. Data in patients over 85 years of age were very limited.  
Relevant subgroups of patients with HeFH (0-1.7%), and patients with severe renal impairment (0-
0.6%) were underrepresented. 
On top of statins 
Bempedoic acid has demonstrated to reduce LDL-C level, an established surrogate marker for CV 
disease, but its impact on clinical outcomes has not been formally tested yet. Reassuringly, a 
numerical beneficial effect on the 3 component MACE (CV death, MI and stroke)  in the statin 
background studies (HR 0.80 (95%CI 0.491, 1.292) and overall phase 3 studies (HR 0.85 (95%CI 
0.529, 1.373) was observed. The upper limit of the CI was well below 1.8 and this excludes any sign of 
CV harm (Reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products 
[EMA/CHMP/50549/2015].  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020

A bempedoic induced increase in exposure of AUC (and Cmax) of statins. Administration of a 
single dose of simvastatin 40 mg with steady-state bempedoic acid 180 mg resulted in a 2-fold 
increase in simvastatin acid exposure. Elevations of -of 1.4-fold for rosuvastatin, 1.5-fold for 
atorvastatin, and 1.5-fold for pravastatin (administered as single doses) and/or their major metabolites 
were observed when coadministered with bempedoic acid 180 mg. (study 1002-073) Higher elevations 
have been observed when these statins were coadministered with a supratherapeutic 240mg dose of 
bempedoic acid(study 1002-012). Bempedoic acid exposure was increased in patients with renal 
impairment, for these patients the impact of the pharmacokinetic interaction with statins may be 
higher. Patients who were on maximum tolerated statin therapy were not down-titrated prior to 
randomisation in the phase 3 studies The impact of this increased exposure on the contribution of 
statins to the increased LDL-C lowering is not exactly clear as this has not been clinically tested, 
although subgroup analyses and additional modelling of the clinical data suggest that the relative 
contribution of bempedoic acid to the overall effect is highest with lower statin doses.  Data  on the 
addition of statin therapy after 24 weeks of therapy as allowed by protocol (7.0% bempedoic acid vs 
8.0% placebo) may have likely provided some support to substantiate the additional effect of statin in 
combination with bempedoic acid, however, data on this have not been provided and are likely very 
limited.  
Differences in efficacy were noted in some subgroup analyses. Females had larger reductions in LDL-C 
than males in the statin background studies. Differences in exposure between males and females may 
have contributed to these different treatment effects. For BMI a slightly different effect was observed, 
but these differences are clinically manageable. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were presented 
across the following age categories of < 65 years, 65 to 75 and ≥ 75 with no substantial differences in 
effects observed. Data in patients over 85 years of age are very limited.  
The treatment effect is smaller, as observed also in the phase 2 studies, in patients treated with higher 
intensity statin therapy compared to low/moderate or no statin use at baseline (p for interaction 
0.060). Equally, for patients using any statin in the SI studies, even low dose showed smaller 
reductions in LDL-C than patients not using any statin (p for interaction 0.032). No obvious differences 
in effect were observed between the individual different statins in those studies where patients 
received bempedoic acid on top of statin therapy, but the specific doses used have not been 
mentioned.  
Relevant subgroups of patients with HeFH (4.9-6.2%), Asians (0-1.1%), and patients severe renal 
impairment (0-0.4%) were underrepresented. 
FCMP 
Pharmacokinetics 
In the pivotal study 1002FDC-034, bioequivalence between the FCMP and the mono components 
bempedoic acid and ezetimibe could not be demonstrated for ezetimibe. However, the clinical study 
1002FDC-053 was considered as primary evidence. This study demonstrated a positive benefit/risk for 
the FDC. Therefore, it was agreed a clinical difference is not expected when switching from the 
monocomponents to the FDC.  
Factorial data on top of statins  
The LDL-C lowering effect of the FCMP of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe (-36.2%) appears not to be 
the sum of the effect observed of the monocomponents (ezetimibe (-23.2%) or bempedoic acid (-
17.2%)) for the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C after 12 weeks of treatment in the FCMP 
study. However, the phase 2 study data do show that the sum of the effect of the mono-components is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 219/239 
 
 
 
 
 
comparable to the effect of the FCMP (LDL-C difference from baseline -47.7%) vs ezetimibe (-21.2%) 
or bempedoic acid (-27.5%)). 
Data on longer term effect on LDL-C of FCMP on top of statin therapy are not available as the study 
was only performed for 12 weeks. 
In the factorial design study, 3 study sites were identified with GCP issues. These 3 study sites have 
been excluded in the FDC study due to potential GCP issues. Sensitivity analyses excluding these sites 
(81 of the 382 patients) resulted in fewer patients from Hispanic origin. A post-hoc sensitivity analyses 
excluding these sites yielded comparable results. 
Sensitivity analysis using observed cases and an on-treatment approach supported the primary 
analysis.  
Add-on to ezetimibe in statin intolerance   
Data on longer term effect on LDL-C of BA on a background of ezetimibe therapy are not available 
as the study was only performed for 12 weeks. 
Sensitivity analysis using observed cases and an on-treatment approach supported the primary 
analysis. 
The LDL-C lowering effect of bempedoic acid on top of ezetimibe background therapy observed in 
statin intolerant patients was substantially higher compared with the effect for the FCMP in comparison 
with ezetimibe which may be explained by the differences in statin background therapy between both 
studies (no or low dose statin therapy vs maximum tolerated statin therapy). This is also in line with 
the difference observed between on top of statin and statin intolerance for the bempedoic acid 
treatment effect. Subgroup analyses generally showed consistency in effect.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Statin intolerance 
The exposure to assess clinical safety is limited in patients who are SI. A total of 415 SI patients were 
treated with bempedoic acid with 332 treated for 12 weeks or more.   
While the total percentage of patients with adverse events was approximately similar between 
bempedoic acid and placebo groups; 57.3% respectively 51.5%, a consistent and slightly higher 
frequency of serious adverse events was observed; 4.6% vs 3.5%, treatment related adverse 
events (21.7% vs 14.1%), and severe adverse events (4.6% vs 3.5%), while moderate and mild AEs 
were approximately similar.  
Bempedoic acid was reasonably well tolerated as relatively few patients discontinued treatment due 
to adverse events, although more patients on bempedoic acid discontinued than in the control 
group (13.0% vs 9.1%), with only a clear difference in gastrointestinal problems (1.7% vs 0.5%) and 
cardiac disorders (1.0% vs 0) based on limited numbers. 
As with statins, laboratory hepatic enzyme elevations were observed with a higher frequency with 
bempedoic acid than placebo (3.9% vs 0%), with AST increased (1.0% vs 0%) and ALT increased 
1.0% vs 0%. ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN elevation occurring in 5 (1.2%) vs 0, while no cases of 
potential Hy’s Law were observed.  
In the phase 3 studies in SI patients, no deaths were reported.

On top of statins 
An adequate number of patients has been evaluated for safety according to ICH guideline on the 
extent of population exposure to assess clinical safety for drugs intended for long-term treatment of 
non-life-threatening conditions (ICH E1). A total of 3008 patients were treated with bempedoic acid or 
placebo on a background of maximum tolerated statin therapy. Among those who received bempedoic 
acid, 1681 patients were treated for at least 24 weeks, and 416 patients were treated for more than 2 
years.   
While the total percentage of patients with adverse events was approximately similar between 
bempedoic acid and placebo groups; 76.3% respectively 76.7%, a consistent and slightly higher 
frequency of serious adverse events was observed; 16.0% respectively 15.2% in patients using 
statins. Treatment related adverse events (24.5% vs 21.5%), and severe adverse events (13.2% vs 
10.7%) were also all slightly higher in bempedoic acid- than placebo-treated patients, respectively, 
while moderate and mild AEs were approximately similar.  
Bempedoic acid was reasonably well tolerated as relatively few patients discontinued treatment due 
to adverse events, although more patients on bempedoic acid discontinued than in the control 
group (10.9% vs 7.5%). This was mainly due to muscular disorders (2.8 vs 1.9%), gastrointestinal 
problems (1.6% vs 0.7%), and cardiac disorders (1.2% vs 0.8%). An incidence of discontinuations due 
to AEs of 4.1% during the first and 2 years of treatment were reported. 
The number of muscular disorders, a known dose dependent adverse effect of statin treatment, is 
increased when bempedoic acid is used on top of statins (13.2% vs 10.2% all AEs; 7.8% vs 6.9% 
treatment related). Increases in confirmed CK levels > 5 x ULN was 7 (0.3%) vs 2 (0.2%) and > 10 x 
ULN was 4 (0.2%) vs 1 (0.1%), supporting the muscular disorders adverse event profile. The low 
intensity statin category (n= 184) showed the highest frequency and highest difference versus placebo 
in musculoskeletal disorders compared to moderate (n=1214) and high intensity (n=1526) statins 
(37.6% vs 23.7%; 24.7% vs 24.0%; 24.3 vs 22.5%). Consistent slightly increased muscle related 
adverse events is observed for atorvastatin (13.3% vs 9.8%, rosuvastatin  12.4% vs 8.0%), 
simvastatin (12.2% vs 7.4%), and pravastatin (17.5% vs 15.4%), while a lower rate in the bempedoic 
acid group was observed for the other statins (n=75). Also, in the limited subgroup of simvastatin 40 
mg an increased incidence of muscle related adverse events was observed (muscle disorders 11.0% 
(n=9) vs 2.9% (n=1); musculoskeletal disorders (22.0% (n=18) vs 5.9% (n=2)).  
As with statins, laboratory hepatic enzyme elevations were observed with a higher frequency with 
bempedoic acid than placebo (2.5% vs 1.5%), with AST increased (1.3% vs 0.3%) and ALT increased 
0.9% vs 0.2%. ALT and/or AST > 3 x ULN elevation occurring in 13 (0.6%) vs 3 (0.3%), while no 
cases of potential Hy’s Law were observed.  
Ezetimibe 
The (known) safety profile of ezetimibe has been described based on a summary of the published data.  
FCMP  
Factorial data on top of statins 
An appropriate number of patients have been evaluated to allow the assessment of safety of the 
bempedoic acid monocomponent. Further, the safety profile of ezetimibe is well known. However, 
the overall exposure for the FCMP is limited to 107 patients treated for 12 weeks (median 
exposure 80 days). For longer term exposure only data of 150 bempedoic acid treated patients and 76

placebo patients in the subgroup of patients with background ezetimibe treatment are available from 
the post-hoc analyses of the 52 weeks phase 3 pool in patients treated on top of statin use. 
Despite the limited number of patients, a slightly higher incidence of adverse events and 
treatment related adverse events was observed for the FCMP (58.9%, 12.1%) and bempedoic acid 
(61.8%, 11.8%) in comparison to ezetimibe (53.2%, 8.3%) or placebo (43.6%, 7.3%). The sensitivity 
analysis excluding the three sites provided a similar pattern. The small phase 2 study supported these 
findings (BA/EZE (70.8%, 41.7%), BA (55.0%, 18.0%), EZE (53.5%, 19.2%)), while no such increase 
was found in the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies in patients with 
background statin therapy (BA (78.7%, 24.0%) versus placebo (90.8%, 23.7%)).  
A consistent increase in liver enzymes for treatment with bempedoic acid in combination with 
ezetimibe was observed, although this was based on limited data. For hepatic abnormalities, in the 
FCMP study 3 hepatic events occurred. For the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 
studies in patients with background statin therapy, hepatic enzyme elevation were rarely noticed but 
with a higher incidence for bempedoic acid than placebo (7 (4.7%) vs 1(1.3%)).  
Add-on to ezetimibe in statin intolerance   
The overall exposure for the combination of bempedoic acid as monocomponent when added to 
background of ezetimibe for 12 weeks in SI patients is limited (median exposure 80 days). 
Despite the limited number of patients, a slightly higher incidence of adverse events and 
treatment related adverse events was observed for bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe (48.6%, 21.5%) 
versus ezetimibe (44.8%, 9.2%).  
A consistent increase in liver enzymes for treatment with bempedoic acid in combination with 
ezetimibe is observed, although this was based on limited data. A higher percentage of 13 (7.2%) 
hepatic events in bempedoic acid vs 0 in placebo occurred, all which can be notified as liver enzyme 
elevations (5 with > 3 x ULN in ALT, 1 >5 x ULN in ALT and 5 > 3 x ULN in AST and none with 
potential Hy’s law). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Statin intolerance 
The long-term exposure is very limited as both phase 3 studies were no longer than 12 and 24 
weeks. 
The number of adjudicated cardiovascular events within the phase 3 SI patient studies are very 
limited but higher for bempedoic acid than for placebo with 9 vs 0. This was mainly attributed to 
coronary revasularisation. All patients had a history of ASCVD and thus such events may not be 
unexpected and likely to be imbalanced due to chance finding. No specific MACE analysis has been 
provided for the SI pool, although the 3 component MACE in the overall phase 3 program was 0.85 
(95% CI 0.53, 1.37). 
No relevant effect on incidence of new onset of diabetes or HbA1C, suggested to be associated 
with statin therapy, was found for bempedoic acid. Worsening of hyperglycemia was reported to be 
5.1% for bempedoic acid vs 9.3% for placebo in patients with diabetes at baseline, and new-onset 
diabetes was reported to be 1.9% vs 2.6% in patients without diabetes at baseline. Mean change for 
HbA1c was -0.03% vs 0.20%. This was based on limited data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 222/239 
 
 
 
 
A reversible increase in creatinine is observed mainly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with 
bempedoic acid (mean change in baseline to week 12 in creatinine of 0.039 vs 0.003, and blood 
creatinine increased (3 (0.7%) vs 0), GFR decreased (4 (1.0%) vs 0). Based on in vitro tests it is 
suggested that bempedoic acid interferes with the renal pathway (OAT2 excretion pathway) and that 
the effect is reversible, however, clinical interaction data to support this are lacking. Further, an 
increase in renal disorders was observed for bempedoic acid treatment (2.4% vs 1.0%), although 
data were limited. Renal failure was 4 (1.0%) vs 1 (0.5%)), renal impairment (2 (0.5%) vs 0). 
There was a reversible increased frequency of uric acid (4.3% vs 1.0%), hyperuricemia (0.7% vs 0%) 
and gout (1.0% vs 0.5%) although data are limited. It is suggested that bempedoic acid interferes 
with the renal pathway (OAT2 excretion pathway), however, data on reversibility and support for this 
proposed mechanism have not  been clearly presented.  
Adverse events of anaemia were observed with bempedoic acid treatment (3 vs 0), decreased 
haemoglobin (1 vs 0) and decreased haematocrit (1 vs 0) although rarely observed.  
No effect on neurocognitive adverse events were found (2 (0.5%) vs 1 (0.5%)), although this was 
not specifically investigated and numbers of spontaneous reported neurocognitive AEs are few. 
The adverse events profile according to subgroups of all relevant age categories and according to 
renal status have not been presented.  
On top of statins 
A bempedoic induced increase in exposure of AUC (and Cmax) of statins of 1.4-1.7 for 
rosuvastatin, 1.5 for atorvastatin, 1.5-2.0 for pravastatin and 1-9-2.0 for simvastatin acid is observed 
after single dose administration of the statin on top of steady state bempedoic acid as evaluated in two 
specific PK studies (study 1002-012 low-mid dose statin, 240 mg bempedoic acid; study 1002-037 
high dose statin, 180 mg bempedoic acid). This could likely be the main driver of the observed 
increased incidence of muscular disorders as observed for the most used statins (atorvastatin, 
rosuvastatin and simvastatin) during the studies.  
The long term exposure is still limited to 416 patients treated for 2 years, while 1558 patients have 
been treated for more than 48 weeks with bempedoic acid. 
The number of adjudicated cardiovascular events within the phase 3 program are still limited with 
188 in 3621 patients, although the event frequency was slightly lower in the bempedoic acid versus 
control groups, with 111 (5.5%) vs 68 (6.8%) in the studies on top of statins and 120 (5.0%) vs 68 
(5.7%) in the overall phase 3 studies. This analysis is primarily driven by coronary revascularisations 
(66 (2.7%) vs 40 (3.3%) in the overall Phase 3). Although the studies were not powered for analysis 
of adjudicated MACE events, a relative risk analysis excludes evidence of cardiovascular harm for 
bempedoic acid with an observed hazard ratio (95% CIs) on the 3 component MACE in the statin 
background studies of 0.80 (0.49, 1.29) and overall phase 3 program of 0.85 (0.53, 1.37). Analyses in 
SI patients separately have not been provided. Any signs of harm were also not noticed for any 
analyses on other MACE definitions. 
In the phase 3 studies, a limited number of 23 deaths have been reported. Although the frequency 
was higher for bempedoic acid (n=19; 0.8%) than for placebo (n= 4; 0.3%), the number of events 
was very limited. This is likely an outlier result as this fatality rate in the controlled phase was 
substantially higher than in the ongoing single arm open-label study (0.9 per 100 person-years based 
on a mean exposure of 306 days in 1487 bempedoic acid patients and 0.3 per 100 person-years in 742 
placebo patients based on a mean exposure of 319 days, versus 0.5 patients per 100 person-years 
with a mean exposure to bempedoic acid of 456.2 days during the open-label study). Furthermore, the 
imbalance is largely explained by the imbalance in CV events (10 (0.5%) vs 3 (0.3%) adjudicated) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 223/239 
 
 
 
 
likely due to the underlying high CV risk of the patients. This observation is not consistent across 
studies as a lower frequency was observed for bempedoic acid vs placebo in study 047 (3 (0.6%) vs 2 
(0.8%)), which is reassuring.  
Further, although an imbalance in benign and malignant neoplasm was observed (5 (0.2%) vs 0), 
the numbers are very limited making any conclusions on this issue uncertain. Further, any association 
with therapy is unlikely as 3 out of 5 events occurred within 90 days after start of the study. Also, in 
the ongoing open-label study, any consistent pattern for the 9 fatal events with association to study 
drug could not be observed, which is reassuring.    
No relevant effect on the incidence of new onset of diabetes or HbA1C, suggested to be associated 
with statin therapy, was found for bempedoic acid. Worsening of hyperglycemia was reported to be 
7.1% for bempedoic acid vs 8.9% for placebo with diabetes at baseline, and new-onset diabetes was 
reported to be 3.1% vs 4.7% in patients without diabetes at baseline. Mean change for HbA1c was-
0.13% vs 0.07%.  
A reversible increase in creatinine was observed mainly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with 
bempedoic acid. Mean change from baseline to week 12 in creatinine was 0.048 vs -0.002, and blood 
creatinine increased (16 (0.8%) vs 4 (0.4%)), GFR decreased (12 (0.6%) vs 1 (0.1%)). Some in vitro 
data suggested that bempedoic acid interferes with the renal pathway (OAT2 excretion pathway), 
however, these in vitro data are inconsistent and clinical data to support this proposed mechanism 
have not been clearly presented. The applicant has committed to further investigate the role of OAT2 
in the renal excretion of creatinine and uric acid (PAM)Further, an increase in renal disorders was 
observed for bempedoic acid treatment (2.9% vs 1.3%). Renal failure was 16 (0.8%) vs 1 (0.1%)), 
renal impairment (11 (0.5%) vs 4 (0.4%), but acute kidney injury was 6 (0.3%) vs 3 (0.3%). 
There was a reversible increased frequency of uric acid (1.6% vs 0.4%), hyperuricemia (1.8% vs 
0.7%) and gout (1.4% vs 0.4%) and treatment related hyperuricemia (0.3% vs 0), and blood uric acid 
increased (0.9% vs 0.1%).  
Adverse events of anaemia were observed with bempedoic acid treatment (2.8% vs 1.9%), while AEs 
of decreased haemoglobin (8 (0.4%) vs 3 (0.3%)) or decreased haematocrit (1 vs 0) were rarely 
observed.  
No effect on neurocognitive adverse events was found (14 (0.7%) vs 8 (0.8%)), although this was 
not specifically investigated and numbers of spontaneous reported neurocognitive AEs are few. 
The adverse events profile according to subgroups of all relevant age categories and according to 
renal status have not been presented.  
The potential interactions of the major inactive metabolite ETC-1002-glucuronide is not exactly clear 
as its steady state concentrations are unknown and will be investigated post-authorisation.  
Decreases in bleeding time (APTT and PT) were observed in rats at exposure levels equivalent to 
the human dose. Data in two short term phase 2 studies did not show such an effect. The effect is 
likely to be an artefact of alterations in blood cell to plasma ratios due to the anemia. 
FCMP  
Pharmacokinetics 
In the pivotal study 1002FDC-034, bioequivalence between the FCMP and the mono components 
bempedoic acid and ezetimibe could not be demonstrated for ezetimibe. However, the clinical study 
1002FDC-053 was considered as primary evidence. This study demonstrated a positive benefit/risk for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 224/239 
 
 
 
 
 
the FDC. Therefore, it was agreed a clinical difference is not expected when switching from the 
monocomponents to the FDC.  
Factorial data on top of statins 
The study was limited to evaluate differences between treatment arms for single term adverse 
events. In the FCMP study, the most frequently observed adverse events for the FCMP 
(BA+ezetimibe), bempedoic acid, ezetimibe and placebo groups respectively were urinary tract 
infection (5.9%, 3.4%, 2.3%, 2.4%), nasopharyngitis (4.7%, 6.8%, 4.7%, 0%), constipation (4.7%, 
0, 2.3%, 0), back pain (3.5%, 3.4%, 2.3%, 4.9%) and hypertension (3.5%, 5.7%, 2.3%, 0). These 
events were also reported most frequently and with a higher incidence as treatment related adverse 
events. In the ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies in patients with background statin 
therapy, the most frequently observed adverse events observed to be higher for bempedoic acid 
versus placebo (on a background of ezetimibe) were nasopharyngitis  (21 (14.0%) vs5 (6.6%)), upper 
respiratory tract infection (5.3% vs 2.6%), bronchitis (4.0% vs 1.3%), gastroenteritis (2.7% vs 0) and 
blood CK increased (3.7% vs 0). 
The FCMP study was too small to provide meaningful conclusions of any patterns in serious adverse 
events. In the FCMP study this was 8 (9.4%) for the FCMP, 7 (8.0%) for bempedoic acid, 10 (9.5%) 
for ezetimibe, and 1 patient (2.4%) for placebo, mostly related to cardiac disorders (8) and none 
considered treatment related. For the post-hoc non-randomised data of pooled phase 3 studies in 
patients with background statin therapy, frequencies across treatment groups are comparable (11.3% 
bempedoic acid, 13.2% placebo). The number of deaths were very limited with one in the phase 2 
study and one in the ezetimibe subgroup of the phase 3 studies. For these datasets it was not useful to 
analyse for MACE events.  
Overall, relative low proportions of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Any 
difference in frequency could not be noticed possibly due to the limited numbers observed. In the 
FCMP this was 7 (8.2%) for the FCMP, 9 (10.2%) for bempedoic acid, 10 (11.6%) for ezetimibe, and 2 
(4.9%) for placebo. For the phase 2 study and the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 
studies in patients with background statin therapy, comparable low rates were observed. 
No clear pattern for risk of diabetes could be observed for the combined use of bempedoic acid with 
ezetimibe, although the numbers were too small to allow for meaningful conclusions. In the FCMP 
study very limited data reported a slightly higher incidence of new onset or worsening of diabetes 
mellitus (4 (4.7%) FCMP, 1 (1.1%) bempedoic acid, 2 (2.3%) ezetimibe and 0 placebo). Some 
difference could be observed for high levels of fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL in patients with a history of 
diabetes (19 (54%) vs 12 (70%) in contrast to patients without a history of diabetes (12 (8.2%) vs 1 
(1.4%)), while HbA1C was comparable. For the ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies in 
patients with background statin therapy, new onset diabetes was observed in 8 patients total.  
In contrast to observation in the data of the monocomponent, no clear pattern of increased muscle 
related disorders for the bempedoic acid ezetimibe combination could be observed based on limited 
numbers. In the FCMP study, muscular disorders were reported with approximately similar frequency 
between treatment groups (6 (57.1%) FCMP, 7 (8.0%) bempedoic acid, 7 (8.1%) ezetimibe, and 3 
(7.3%) placebo). In the phase 2 study, muscle related AEs were also slightly higher for bempedoic acid 
with ezetimibe (3(12.5%) vs bempedoic acid(6 (6.0%)) but comparable to ezetimibe (12 (12.1%). For 
the post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup of pooled phase 3 studies in patients with background statin therapy, 
this was only slightly higher for bempedoic acid (23 (15.3%) vs (11 (14.5%). Myalgia was mostly 
reported, but with a higher frequency in placebo (11 (7.3%) vs 9 (11.8%)).  
Limited data showed a bempedoic acid induced increase in serum creatinine (with currently 
insufficient clarified mechanism of action) starting at beginning of therapy and slightly increased 
Assessment report

frequency of renal disorder with the bempedoic acid with or without ezetimibe. The mean creatinine 
levels slightly increased during the start of therapy for the FCMP and bempedoic acid compared to 
ezetimibe and placebo. Moreover, more patients shifted to a worse eGFR category (17 (16%) FCMP, 18 
(17%) BA, 12 (11.7%) EZE, unknown PLB). Renal disorders were slightly higher for the FCMP (4 
(3.7%)) and bempedoic acid (2 (1.8%)) vs none in ezetimibe or placebo.  
A bempedoic acid induced increase in uric acid (with currently insufficient clarified mechanism of 
action) was observed, in rare cases resulting in adverse events reported increased uric acid levels, but 
no adverse events of gout were reported, likely due to the limited database. A slightly higher mean 
change in uric acid levels was observed (approximately 0.5 mg/dL) resulting in slightly higher mean 
percent change (11.8% FCMP, 16.1% bempedoic acid) versus ezetimibe (1.5%) and placebo (-1.3%) 
and higher abnormal uric acid levels from 4 weeks onward (40 (37%), 47 (42%), 19 (17%) and 9 
(16%)) with 3 patients (2.8%) in the FCMP group and 2 patients (1.8%) in the bempedoic acid group 
who experienced adverse events of blood uric acid increased (2 in FCMP treatment related). For the 
post-hoc ezetimibe subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies in patients with background statin 
therapy, only 3 events of uric acid increase were observed.  
Very limited numbers of neurocognitive disorders were reported, only in the post-hoc ezetimibe 
subgroup data of pooled phase 3 studies (0.3% and 1.1% bempedoic acid and placebo). This does not 
allow for any conclusions. 
Mean haemoglobin decreased slightly with the FCMP (-0.31 g /dL) and bemepdoic (-0.28) compared 
to ezetimibe (-0.11) and placebo (0.15) at week 12. Adverse events of haemoglobin decreased and 
anaemia were very limited. 
No meaningful differences in vital signs, including hypertension, were observed in the studies. 
In the FCMP study, for the subgroup of gender, a slightly higher incidence of adverse events was 
found for females than for males. Only data for the difference between <>65 years of age have been 
provided, not indicating substantial differences in AE frequency between these categories. Data on the 
age categories according to <65 years, 65-74, 75-84 and >85 years of age are currently not available.  
In the FCMP study, 3 study sites were identified with potential GCP issues. Sensitivity analyses 
excluding these sites did not substantially alter the safety findings. 
Add-on to ezetimibe in statin intolerance   
The add-on to ezetimibe non-responders study (study 048) in patients who are SI was limited to 
evaluate differences between treatment arms for single term adverse events. The most frequently 
observed adverse events that had a higher incidence in the bempedoic acid/ezetimibe combination 
than in the ezetimibe group were; blood uric increased (14 (7.7%) vs 2 (2.3%)), headache (8 (4.4%) 
vs 3 (3.4%)), and liver function test increased (7 (3.9%) vs 0). These events were also reported most 
frequently and with a higher incidence as treatment related adverse events.  
The study was too small to provide meaningful conclusions of any patterns in serious adverse 
events. Numbers of serious adverse events were 8 (5 vs 3). No deaths were observed.  
Overall, relative low proportions of patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Any 
difference in frequency could not be noticed possibly due to the limited numbers observed. This was 11 
(6.1%) for bempedoic acid and 5 (5.7%) for placebo.  
No clear pattern for risk of diabetes could be observed for the combined use of bempedoic acid with 
ezetimibe, although the numbers were too small to allow for meaningful conclusions. No differences 
were found for new onset or worsening DM (6(3.3%) bempedoic acid vs 3 (3.4%) placebo).  
Assessment report

A slightly higher incidence for bempedoic acid was observed for muscle related disorders (11(6.1%) 
vs 5 (5.7%)) and CK increases (3 (1.7%) vs 0), although data are limited to draw meaningful 
conclusions.  
Limited data showed a bempedoic acid induced increase in serum creatinine starting at beginning of 
therapy and slightly increased frequency of renal disorder with the bempedoic acid. The mean 
creatinine levels slightly increased during the start of therapy for bempedoic acid compared to placebo. 
Also, more patients shifted from mild to moderate eGFR category (19 (11%) BA, 5 (6.2%) PLB at week 
12). Further, a slightly higher incidence of renal disorders for bempedoic acid was observed (7(3.9%) 
vs 1 (1.1%)).  
A bempedoic acid induced increase in uric acid was observed, in rare cases resulting in adverse 
events reported increased uric acid levels, but no adverse events of gout were reported, likely due to 
the limited database. Increases in uric acid were 0.54 mg/dL vs -0.28 mg/dL for bempedoic acid and 
placebo, shifts in uric acid and adverse events of blood uric acid increased were 14 (7.7%) vs 2 
(2.3%).  
No neurocognitive disorders were evaluated or reported. 
Haemoglobin decreased was only observed in one patient. 
No meaningful differences in vital signs, including hypertension, were observed. 
Data according to subgroups do not show meaningful differences.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Statin intolerance 
Bempedoic acid used in patients with hypercholesterolaemia, mixed dyslipidaemia and in patients with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who were SI has demonstrated a significant consistent 
reduction in LDL-C and other relevant lipid parameters like non-HDL, TC and ApoB. Furthermore, the 
effect was robust across several subgroups including age, race, gender, ethnicity, region, history of 
diabetes, baseline BMI, baseline LDL-C, ezetimibe use, and baseline GFR category.  Bempedoic acid 
displays an acceptable safety profile, with a relatively low number of patients discontinuing treatment 
and/or suffering a serious adverse event. However, bempedoic acid has some specific adverse effects 
including reversible increases in uric acid and gout, and a sustained increase in serum creatinine. 
Further, a decrease in haemoglobin with increased anaemia is observed for which the long-term impact 
remains uncertain. Also, bempedoic acid demonstrates some of the side effects known to be associated 
with lipid lowering therapy including liver- and renal disorders. In contrast, no association is suggested 
between the use of bempedoic acid and the risk of diabetes or muscular side effects; side effects 
associated with the use of statins. 
For SI patients, long term effects beyond 24 weeks are lacking. Despite a very limited increase in CV 
events, information about long term potential cardiovascular harm, deduced by extrapolating the 
results from the bempedoic acid MACE data on top of statins, likely excludes any trend towards the risk 
of cardiovascular harm. Further data will be provided with the ongoing CV outcome study in SI 
patients. 
On top of statins 
Bempedoic acid used in patients on top of maximum statin therapy including ezetimibe and very 
limited use of PCSK9 inhibitors has demonstrated a modest reduction in LDL-C. The effect was 
consistent for other relevant lipid parameters like non-HDL, TC and ApoB and robust across several 
subgroups including age, race, ethnicity, region, history of diabetes, baseline LDL-C, HeFH status, prior 
ASCVD, ezetimibe use, and baseline GFR category. 
Although the effect was modest, it can be considered to be clinically relevant as the reduction in 
LDL-cholesterol is an established surrogate marker for cardiovascular outcome. The 18% reduction in 
LDL-C from a baseline LDL-C level of 2.6-3.2 mmol/L could potentially translate in a clinically relevant 
risk reduction of approximately 15% of major CV events based on this relationship established for 
statin therapy (over 5 years). 
Analyses of MACE events on top of statins did exclude any trend towards cardiovascular harm, as 
required before approval (Reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal 
products [EMA/CHMP/50549/2015]). The slight increase in deaths with bemepdoic acid in the 
randomised studies is based on very limited numbers making any conclusions uncertain; this is likely  
an outlier result as the death rate on bempedoic acid treatment was substantially higher than in the 
ongoing open-label study and deaths could largely be explained by the high CV risk profile of the 
patients. Further, the higher frequency of very rare cases of neoplasms occurred mostly short after 
study start, which makes any association with bemepdoic acid treatment unlikely. The actual impact of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 232/239 
 
 
 
 
 
the long-term lipid reduction with bempedoic acid in terms of improved cardiovascular outcome is still 
missing and will be addressed in the post-authorisation phase. A long term outcome study in 12600 SI 
patients treated for 3.5 years is ongoing and should provide more insight on these uncertainties.  
Although in general a comparable safety profile of bempedoic acid is demonstrated when compared 
with the group characterized by statin intolerance, an increased frequency of muscular disorders was 
observed. This is most likely driven by the bempedoic acid induced increased exposure of statins. 
Administration of a single dose of simvastatin 40 mg with steady-state bempedoic acid 180 mg 
resulted in a 2-fold increase in simvastatin acid exposure. Elevations of 1.4-fold for rosuvastatin, 1.5-
fold for atorvastatin, and 1.5-fold for pravastatin and/or their major metabolites were observed when 
coadministered with bempedoic acid 180 mg.  The current proposed dose recommendation, to limit the 
simvastatin dose prior to use of bempedoic acid, is considered acceptable. 
Long term data of bempedoic acid on top of statins; beyond one year of treatment, can be considered 
limited since the intended treatment may be lifelong. However, the data available indicate that efficacy 
is maintained over time and safety so far does not suggest any long-term major concerns.  
FCMP 
Factorial data on top of statins 
Bempedoic acid in combination with ezetimibe in patients with hypercholesterolemia or mixed 
dyslipidaemia at increased risk for CV events and treated with maximum tolerated statin dose has 
demonstrated a consistent reduction in LDL-C and other relevant lipid parameters which was 
substantial compared to placebo (statin background therapy) but only moderate in comparison to 
bempedoic acid or ezetimibe monotherapy. Despite that the LDL-C lowering effect of the combination 
was somewhat moderate when compared to bempedoic acid or ezetimibe monocomponents, these are 
considered to be clinically relevant because the reduction in the LDL-cholesterol is an important 
surrogate marker with potential benefits in terms of cardiovascular outcome. Analyses on MACE events 
based on the phase 3 studies for the single bempedoic acid component did not indicate any trend 
towards cardiovascular harm. However, currently the impact of the bempedoic acid monocomponent 
on cardiovascular risk reduction remains unknown, while this has been demonstrated for ezetimibe in 
the IMPROVE-IT study. Further, it is not expected that improvement on cardiovascular outcome will be 
evaluated for the combination and thus such data needs to be extrapolated from the effects observed 
with the monocomponents. 
Further, the combination of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe on top of statin therapy showed an 
expected safety profile that is in line with adverse effects observed with bempedoic acid and/or 
ezetimibe, with relatively limited patients who discontinue FCMP treatment and who demonstrate 
serious adverse events. Although the safety database is still limited the FCMP patients seem to 
experience adverse events comparable in character, but slightly more, as patients using either 
ezetimibe or bempedoic acid alone. Due to the small database, a signal for an increased frequency of 
muscular disorders, most likely triggered by bempedoic acid induced increased exposure of statins, 
could not be observed but can be expected. This can be of concern in patients already treated with 
maximum tolerated statin therapy. A similar concern is applicable for treatment of bempedoic acid on 
top of maximum tolerated statins.  
Add-on to ezetimibe in statin intolerance   
In statin-intolerant patients, the addition of bempedoic acid to patients insufficiently responding to 
ezetimibe therapy to reach their target LDL-C level, shows a substantial reduction in LDL-C. In line 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 233/239 
 
 
 
 
 
with the data of the studies, as displayed in the monocomponent dossier, the effect in SI patients was 
much larger than in patients treated on top of maximum tolerated statin therapy.  
Within the study pool of statin-intolerant patients, very limited data are available on CV risk reduction, 
and thus information should be extrapolated from the MACE analyses within the pool of patients 
treated on top of statins, which demonstrated an absence of CV harm. The combination of bempedoic 
acid with ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients displays an expected safety profile that is in line with 
adverse effects observed with the monocomponents bempedoic acid and/or ezetimibe Finally, for an 
intended lifelong treatment, a follow-up treatment period of 12 weeks in the randomised study can be 
considered very limited. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Bempedoic acid as monocomponent 
Statin intolerance 
Patients included in the studies were generally in need of further treatment to reduce LDL-C levels due 
to their increased cardiovascular risk. A substantial clinically relevant lipid reduction is observed, with 
an acceptable safety profile including some statin like, but less outspoken, adverse events and some 
more specifically related to the use of bempedoic acid of which some of these appear to be reversible. 
The safety findings are based on limited data, but the findings are largely consistent with the safety 
profile observed in bempedoic acid on top of statins.  
On top of statins 
The strategy of patient inclusion was generally in agreement with clinical practice guidelines as the 
included patients had elevated LDL-C levels despite treatment with statins and other lipid lowering 
therapy. All patients were in the need for further treatment to reduce LDL-C levels due to their high 
cardiovascular risk. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors were only used in up to 15% respectively 2% of 
the patients despite proven cardiovascular benefit and being indicated for a similar patient population 
as currently proposed. This may potentially limit external validity of the currently obtained data. In 
both studies, only a modest incremental lipid reduction was seen with adding bempedoic acid to 
statins, especially on top of high intensity statins and/or on top of ezetimibe.  
The combined use of bempedoic acid and statins appears to be complex as both target a 
similar pathway for cholesterol inhibition. Bempedoic acid also increases statin exposure. 
Elevations of 2-fold for simvastatin and 1.4-fold to 1.5-fold in AUC of atorvastatin, pravastatin, and 
rosuvastatin and/or their major metabolites were observed when coadministered with bempedoic acid 
180 mg. This increased statin exposure is likely to be the main driver of the increased incidence of 
muscle disorders as observed in the pool of bempedoic acid on top of statins and seen for 
atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin as the most used statins during the studies;  a side effects 
being absent in the SI pool. However, this does not exclude any other potential factors for this 
observed safety issue. To address this potential problem, the simvastatin dose should be limited to 20 
mg generally and 40 mg for high risk patients prior to initiation of bempedoic acid treatment (section 
4.2 of the SmPC), to contra-indicate higher doses than 40 mg simvastatin, and to reduce any statin 
dose when muscle related events occur (section 4.4 of the SmPC). It is acknowledged that this 
approach has not been formally tested in the clinical studies. Data on the addition of statin therapy 24 
weeks after randomisation as allowed by protocol (7.0% bempedoic acid vs 8.0% placebo) in the 
phase 3 studies has not been provided due to the limited numbers. Nevertheless, a 2- fold dose 
reduction of simvastatin, as would be needed for patients already on a 80 mg simvastatin dose, is 
expected to result in an approximately 2-fold reduction in exposure based on the data as presented in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 234/239 
 
 
 
 
the single dose PK study and may thus match a comparable exposure as prior to bempedoic acid use. 
Differentiation in recommendations for simvastatin as compared to recommendations regarding other 
statins was considered acceptable. This risk is likely to be higher  for simvastatin (e.g. based on the 
SEARCH study), higher doses of simvastatin were largely excluded by the introduction of a specific 
amendment during the study (simvastatin use < 40 mg), and the interaction with bempedoic induced 
increase exposure is the strongest for simvastatin (2-fold vs 1.5-fold for other statins). But given that 
an increased risk is already observed with the 40 mg, although based on limited data (higher 
frequency of muscle related events with the 40 mg dose in the study with one case of myositis), and 
exclusion of higher doses than 40 mg with the proposed dose recommendation, a contra-indication for 
simvastatin > 40 mg in section 4.3 of the SmPC was included,. Currently, a warning statement for the 
potential risk of myopathy with concomitant use of other statins than simvastatin is also included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The effect of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined in 
a dedicated CV outcome trial. Although a reduction in LDL-C is considered to be a valid surrogate for 
cardiovascular risk reduction, this finding is mainly based on outcome data obtained with statins. It is 
acknowledged that more recent studies in ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors strengthen the value of LDL-
C as a surrogate marker. However, bempedoic acid has a new mechanism of action for which a 
similar relationship has eventually to be established. The cardiovascular outcome trial (Study 1002-043 
in SI patients) is already ongoing and should provide further data regarding cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality in patients treated with bempedoic acid. 
FCMP 
On top of statins 
The LDL-C lowering effect of the combined use of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe in comparison to 
ezetimibe and bempedoic acid monocomponents is only moderate although of clinical relevance. The 
data are obtained from a factorial design study, lacking clear data on the additional effect of the 
combination in those patients not sufficiently responding on ezetimibe or bempedoic acid.  Further, as 
discussed for the bempedoic acid monocomponent, similar safety issues apply to the combined use of 
the FCMP with statins although a clear pattern of increased muscle disorders could not be observed 
due to the limited database with the FCMP. The identified safety issues appear to be limited, not of 
specific concern and in line with the safety issues identified in the bempedoic acid monocomponent and 
known from ezetimibe. Although the efficacy data suggest that the balance of benefits of the FCMP 
outweighs the risks, there are several outstanding issues related to the available clinical data and the 
intended patient population to be treated with the FCMP.  
Statin intolerance 
The screening inclusion was meeting the definition of hypercholesterolemia, with ≥ 100 mg/dL in 
patients taking ezetimibe and ≥ 120 mg/dL in patients not taking ezetimibe. Identification of patients 
eligible for randomization was based on LDL-C level of ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) at baseline without 
any CV risk level requirement.  
The LDL-C lowering effect of the combined use of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe in comparison to 
ezetimibe and bempedoic acid monocomponents is substantial and of clinical relevance. In the statin-
intolerant population, insufficiently controlled with ezetimibe, a positive trade-off between benefit and 
risk of bempedoic acid has been demonstrated. Comparable safety issues can be identified for the 
combined use of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe as identified in the bempedoic acid and ezetimibe 
monocomponents. Similar to the use of the FCMP on top of statins, there is also a lack of 
cardiovascular outcome data for the combined use of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe in SI patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 235/239 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally, for an intended lifelong treatment, a follow-up treatment period of 12 weeks in the randomised 
studies and a treatment period of 52 weeks in the subgroup of patients treated with background 
ezetimibe therapy from the pivotal phase 3 studies of the bempedoic acid monocomponent can be 
considered limited. The impact of the bempedoic acid monocomponent on cardiovascular risk reduction 
remains unknown. A large outcome study in SI patients is currently ongoing and evaluates the CV 
effect of bempedoic acid. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
For the proposed combination product of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe, in line with the EMA Guideline 
on the clinical development of fixed combination medical products, (EMA/CHMP/158268/2017), the 
basic requirements for any fixed combination medicinal product are: 
• 
• 
Justification of the pharmacological and medicinal rationale for the combination. As both products 
(bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) have distinct but complementary mechanisms of action, the 
pharmacological rationale appears reasonable. Further, there is an unmet medical need to further 
lower LDL-C levels for those patients not able to reach the anticipated LDL-C goals with the 
maximum lipid lowering therapy. Also, it is reasonable to consider that an FCMP reduces pill 
burden and could improve the easiness of use. 
Establishment of the evidence base for the relevant contribution of all active substances to the 
desired therapeutic effect. The data from the factorial design study show that in patients who are 
insufficiently controlled with statin therapy, bempedoic acid alone, ezetimibe alone and the 
combination result in further reductions in LDL-C, with the FCMP resulting in the largest 
reductions overall. A similar study has not been performed in SI patients, but ezetimibe has 
previously shown to be efficacious in this population, and in study 1002-048 bempedoic acid was 
shown to reduce LDL-C further in SI patients that were insufficiently controlled by ezetimibe 
alone. 
• 
Establishment of the evidence base for the positive benefit risk for the combination in the targeted 
population. In this respect, the several proposed indications should be discussed following the 
evidentiary requirements as outlined in the FCMP and lipid-modifying guidelines. 
Treatment of insufficiently responding patients (‘add-on indication’) 
On top of statins 
The ‘add-on’ indication is defined as adding one component of the FCMP to patients not sufficiently 
responding to the other component of the FCMP (apart from other background therapy such as 
maximum tolerated statin therapy). As such, specific studies of the FCMP in patients who are on 
maximally tolerated statin doses and who do not sufficiently respond to ezetimibe or bempedoic acid 
have not been conducted. Only a factorial design study (on top of maximum tolerated statin therapy) 
has been submitted, which supports the contribution of the individual components and the combination 
to the therapeutic efficacy, but does not establish a positive benefit-risk of the FCMP in the claimed 
situations in patients not responding to either one of the FCMP monocomponents. Nevertheless, added 
benefit (and risk) of bempedoic acid in patients insufficiently controlled with ezetimibe has been shown 
in statin-intolerant patients. To support an ‘add on’ indication for the FCMP in patients on maximally 
tolerated statin doses and insufficiently responding to ezetimibe, data are present from the subset of 
226 (7.5%) patients that were also taking ezetimibe, of whom 217 patients had a week 12 LDL-C 
measurement in studies 040 and 047 on top of statins. For these patients, mean percent reduction in 
LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 was -16.2% in patients receiving bempedoic acid compared with -
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86205/2020  
Page 236/239 
 
 
 
 
 
2.8% for placebo, with a difference from placebo of -13.4% (p <0.001), comparable to the overall 
efficacy findings in these studies. Because the safety profile of these patients subsets does not 
importantly differentiate between the FCMP and the monocomponents, although the data of the 
factorial design study are limited to 12 weeks of treatment, these data reasonably support the 
indication of combination with a statin in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum 
tolerated dose of a statin in addition to ezetimibe. 
Statin intolerance 
In the statin-intolerant population, added benefit (and risk) of bempedoic acid in patients insufficiently 
controlled with ezetimibe has been shown. These data, therefore, support an ‘add on’ indication for the 
FCMP in SI patients insufficiently responding to ezetimibe.  
However, efficacy in terms of an ‘add-on’ indication of the FCMP in the context of a patient population 
not meeting treatment goals with bempedoic acid alone and in whom ezetimibe is added, has not been 
examined and was therefore not acceptable. An ‘add-on’ indication for the FCMP in patients non-
responsive to bempedoic acid in SI patients is therefore currently not approvable. Further, current 
learned society guidelines recommend ezetimibe and bile acid sequestrants in SI patients. There are 
also no major or unique reasons to exclude patients from using ezetimibe. 
Initial combination treatment 
The proposed ‘initial combination treatment” indication concerning a patient population unable to reach 
LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin alone and the patient population either 
statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated was considered not approvable. The added 
benefit in terms of reduction by lowering LDL-C by initial combining bempedoic acid with ezetimibe 
instead of following a sequential addition of the single lipid lowering product (preferably starting with 
ezetimibe) is likely to be limited and it is highly questionable whether this would translate into a 
difference in CV risk reduction. Sequential treatment allows the physician to evaluate the incremental 
contribution of each component, both in terms of efficacy as well as safety, and avoids the risk of 
overtreatment, especially knowing that the effect could be heterogeneous between patients and the 
effect needs to be monitored. Finally, although benefits on CV outcomes have been demonstrated for 
ezetimibe such impact is not established for bempedoic acid.   
Switch in patients adequately controlled with two or more active substances used in 
combination (‘substitution’) 
In principle, the factorial design study data in addition to the other clinical study data support the 
rationale for the combined use of the active substances and is considered sufficient for a substitution 
indication regarding patients already being treated with the combination of bempedoic acid and 
ezetimibe as separate tablets with or without a statin.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nustendi is positive.

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Nustendi is favourable in the following indication: 
Nustendi is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-
familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
in combination with a statin in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated 
dose of a statin in addition to ezetimibe (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4), 
alone in patients who are either statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated, and are 
unable to reach LDL-C goals with ezetimibe alone, 
in patients already being treated with the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe as 
separate tablets with or without statin.

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the

Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that bempedoic acid is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.   
Paediatric Data 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
EMEA-002200-PIP01-17 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver for the paediatric population 
from birth to less than 18 years of age.

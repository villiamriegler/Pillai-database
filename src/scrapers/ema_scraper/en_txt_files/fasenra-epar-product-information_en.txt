CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Fasenra is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with severe eosinophilic 
asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β-agonists 
(see section 5.1).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Fasenra treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of 
severe asthma.
After proper training in the subcutaneous injection technique and education about signs and symptoms 
of hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.4), patients with no known history of anaphylaxis or their
caregivers may administer Fasenra if their physician determines that it is appropriate, with medical 
follow-up as necessary. Self-administration should only be considered in patients already experienced 
with Fasenra treatment.
Posology
The recommended dose of benralizumab is 30 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for the 
first 3 doses, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. If an injection is missed on the planned date, dosing 
should resume as soon as possible on the indicated regimen; a double dose must not be administered.
2
Fasenra is intended for long-term treatment. A decision to continue the therapy should be made at least 
annually based on disease severity, level of exacerbation control and blood eosinophil counts.
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2).
Renal and hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Fasenra in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years has not been 
established. Currently limited data in children 6 to 11 years old and data in adolescents aged 12 to 17 
are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.
The safety and efficacy of Fasenra in children less than 6 years have not been established. No data are 
available.
Method of administration
This medicinal product is administered as a subcutaneous injection.
It should be injected into the thigh or abdomen. If the healthcare professional or caregiver administers 
the injection, the upper arm can also be used. It should not be injected into areas where the skin is 
tender, bruised, erythematous, or hardened.
Comprehensive instructions for administration using the pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen are provided
in the ‘Instructions for Use’.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Asthma exacerbations
Fasenra should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations.
Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens
after initiation of treatment.
Corticosteroids
Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids after initiation of Fasenra therapy is not recommended. 
Reduction in corticosteroid doses, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the 
supervision of a physician.
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Acute systemic reactions including anaphylactic reactions and hypersensitivity reactions 
(e.g. urticaria, papular urticaria, rash) have occurred following administration of benralizumab (see 
3
section 4.8). These reactions may occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a 
delayed onset (i.e. days).
A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to benralizumab may be a risk factor for anaphylaxis following 
Fasenra administration (see section 4.3). In line with clinical practice, patients should be monitored for 
an appropriate time after administration of Fasenra.
In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, Fasenra should be discontinued permanently and 
appropriate therapy initiated. 
Parasitic (Helminth) infection
Eosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients 
with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical trials. It is unknown if 
benralizumab may influence a patient’s response against helminth infections.
Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating therapy with 
benralizumab. If patients become infected, while receiving treatment and do not respond to 
anti-helminth treatment, therapy with benralizumab should be discontinued until infection resolves.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed. In a randomised, double-blind parallel-group study of 103 
patients aged between 12 and 21 years with severe asthma, the humoral antibody responses induced by 
seasonal influenza virus vaccination do not appear to be affected by benralizumab treatment. An effect 
of benralizumab on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medicinal products is not expected (see 
section 5.2).
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the 
clearance of benralizumab. There is no evidence of IL-5Rα expression on hepatocytes. Eosinophil 
depletion does not produce chronic systemic alterations of proinflammatory cytokines.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There is a limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of benralizumab in 
pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3).
Monoclonal antibodies, such as benralizumab, are transported across the placenta linearly as 
pregnancy progresses; therefore, potential exposure to a fetus is likely to be greater during the second 
and third trimester of pregnancy. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Fasenra during pregnancy. Its 
administration to pregnant women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is 
greater than any possible risk to the fetus.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether benralizumab or its metabolites are excreted in human or animal milk. A risk to 
the breast-fed child cannot be excluded.
4
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from using 
Fasenra taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman.
Fertility
There are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no adverse effects of benralizumab 
treatment on fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Fasenra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment are headache (8%) and pharyngitis
(3%). Cases of anaphylactic reaction of varied severity have been reported.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions have been reported with benralizumab during clinical studies and 
from post-marketing experience. The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following 
convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available 
data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reaction
Injection site reactions 
In placebo-controlled studies, injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, pruritus, papule) occurred at 
a rate of 2.2% in patients treated with the recommended benralizumab dose compared with 1.9% in 
patients treated with placebo. The events were transient in nature.
5
Long-term safety 
In a 56-week extension trial (Trial 4) in patients with asthma from Trials 1, 2 and 3, 842 patients were 
treated with Fasenra at the recommended dose and remained in the trial. The overall safety profile was 
similar to the asthma trials described above. Additionally, in an open-label safety extension trial (Trial 
5) in patients with asthma from previous trials, 226 patients were treated with Fasenra at the 
recommended dose for up to 43 months. Combined with the treatment period in previous studies, this 
corresponds to a median follow-up of 3.4 years (range 8.5 months – 5.3 years). The safety profile 
during this follow-up period was consistent with the known safety profile of Fasenra.
Paediatric population
There are limited data in paediatric patients. There were 108 adolescents aged 12 to 17 with asthma 
enrolled in the phase 3 trials (Trial 1: n=53, Trial 2: n=55). Of these, 46 received placebo, 40 received 
benralizumab every 4 weeks for 3 doses, followed by every 8 weeks thereafter, and 22 received 
benralizumab every 4 weeks. Adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 (n=86) from Trials 1 and 2 continued 
treatment with benralizumab in Trial 4 for up to 108 weeks. The frequency, type and severity of 
adverse reactions in the adolescent population were observed to be similar to those seen in adults.
In an open-label, uncontrolled pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of 48 weeks duration in a 
limited number of paediatric patients (n=28) with uncontrolled severe asthma, the safety profile for
patients aged 6 to 11 years old was similar to the adult and adolescent population (see section 4.2).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Doses of up to 200 mg were administered subcutaneously in clinical trials to patients with eosinophilic 
asthma without evidence of dose-related toxicities.
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with benralizumab. If overdose occurs, the patient 
should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. 
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX10
Mechanism of action
Benralizumab is an anti-eosinophil, humanised afucosylated, monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa). It
specifically binds to the alpha subunit of the human interleukin-5 receptor (IL-5Rα). The IL-5 receptor 
is specifically expressed on the surface of eosinophils and basophils. The absence of fucose in the Fc 
domain of benralizumab results in high affinity for FcɣRIII receptors on immune effector cells such as 
natural killer (NK) cells. This leads to apoptosis of eosinophils and basophils through enhanced 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which reduces eosinophilic inflammation. 
6
Pharmacodynamic effects
Effect on blood eosinophils
Treatment with benralizumab results in near complete depletion of blood eosinophils within 24 hours 
following the first dose which is maintained throughout treatment. The depletion of blood eosinophils 
is accompanied by a reduction in serum eosinophil granule proteins eosinophil derived neurotoxin 
(EDN) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and a reduction in blood basophils.
Effect on eosinophils in the airway mucosa
The effect of benralizumab on eosinophils in the airway mucosa in asthmatic patients with elevated
sputum eosinophil counts (at least 2.5%) was evaluated in a 12-week, phase 1, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled clinical study with benralizumab 100 or 200 mg SC. In this study there was a 
median reduction from baseline in airway mucosa eosinophils of 96% in the benralizumab-treated 
group compared to a 47% reduction in the placebo group (p=0.039).
Clinical efficacy
The efficacy of benralizumab was evaluated in 3 randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled clinical trials between 28 to 56 weeks duration, in patients aged 12 to 75 years. 
In these studies, benralizumab was administered at a dose of 30 mg once every 4 weeks for the first 
3 doses, and then every 4 or 8 weeks thereafter as add-on to background treatment and was evaluated 
in comparison with placebo.
The two exacerbation trials, SIROCCO (Trial 1) and CALIMA (Trial 2), enrolled a total of 2,510 
patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, 64% females, with a mean age of 49 years. Patients had a 
history of 2 or more asthma exacerbations requiring oral or systemic corticosteroid treatment (mean of 
3) in the past 12 months, Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) score of 1.5 or more at screening, 
and reduced lung function at baseline (mean predicted pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 
1 second [FEV1] of 57.5%), despite regular treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
(Trial 1) or with medium or high-dose ICS (Trial 2) and a long-acting β-agonist (LABA); at least one 
additional controller was administered to 51% and 41% of these patients, respectively.
For the oral corticosteroid (OCS) reduction trial ZONDA (Trial 3), a total of 220 asthma patients (61% 
female; mean age of 51 years) were enrolled; they were treated with daily OCS (8 to 40 mg per day; 
median of 10 mg) in addition to regular use of high-dose ICS and LABA with at least one additional 
controller to maintain asthma control in 53% of the cases. The trial included an 8-week run-in period 
during which the OCS was titrated to the minimum effective dose without losing asthma control.
Patients had blood eosinophil counts ≥150 cells/μL and a history of at least one exacerbation in the 
past 12 months. 
While 2 dose regimens were studied in Trials 1, 2, and 3, the recommended dose regimen is 
benralizumab administered every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then every 8 weeks thereafter (see 
section 4.2) as no additional benefit was observed by more frequent dosing. The results summarised 
below are those for the recommended dose regimen.
Exacerbation trials
The primary endpoint was the annual rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations in patients 
with baseline blood eosinophil counts ≥300 cells/μL who were taking high-dose ICS and LABA. 
Clinically significant asthma exacerbation was defined as worsening of asthma requiring use of 
oral/systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days, and/or emergency department visits requiring use of 
oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalisation. For patients on maintenance OCS, this was 
defined as a temporary increase in stable oral/systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days or a single 
depo-injectable dose of corticosteroids.
7
In both trials, patients receiving benralizumab experienced significant reductions in annual 
exacerbation rates compared to placebo in patients with blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL. In addition,
change from baseline in mean FEV1 showed benefit as early as 4 weeks, which was maintained 
through to end of treatment (Table 2).  
Reductions in exacerbation rates were observed irrespective of baseline eosinophil count; however, 
increasing baseline eosinophil counts was identified as a potential predictor of improved treatment 
response particularly for FEV1.

Across Trials 1 and 2 combined, there was a numerically greater exacerbation rate reduction and 
greater improvements in FEV1 with increasing baseline blood eosinophils. 
The rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation and/or emergency room visits for patients receiving 
benralizumab compared to placebo for Trial 1 were 0.09 versus 0.25 (rate ratio 0.37, 95% CI: 0.20, 
0.67, p=<0.001) and for Trial 2 were 0.12 versus 0.10 (rate ratio 1.23, 95% CI: 0.64, 2.35, p=0.538).
In Trial 2, there were too few events in the placebo treatment arm to draw conclusions for 
exacerbations requiring hospitalisation or emergency room visits.
8
In both Trials 1 and 2, patients receiving benralizumab experienced statistically significant reductions 
in asthma symptoms (Total Asthma Score) compared to patients receiving placebo. Similar 
improvement in favour of benralizumab was observed for the ACQ-6 and Standardised Asthma 
Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 Years and Older (AQLQ(S)+12) (Table 3).

Subgroup analyses by prior exacerbation history
Subgroup analyses from Trials 1 and 2 identified patients with higher prior exacerbation history as a 
potential predictor of improved treatment response. When considered alone or in combination with 
baseline blood eosinophils count, these factors may further identify patients who may achieve greater 
response from benralizumab treatment (Table 4).

Oral corticosteroid dose reduction trials
ZONDA (Trial 3), a placebo-controlled study, and PONENTE (Trial 6), a single arm, open-label 
study, evaluated the effect of benralizumab on reducing the use of maintenance OCS.
In Trial 3, the primary endpoint was percent reduction from baseline of the final OCS dose during 
Weeks 24 to 28, while maintaining asthma control. Table 5 summarises the study results for Trial 3.

Lung function, asthma symptom score, ACQ-6 and AQLQ(S)+12 were also assessed in Trial 3 and 
showed results similar to those in Trials 1 and 2.
Trial 6 enrolled 598 adult patients with severe asthma (blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/μL at entry 
or ≥300 cells/μL in the past 12 months if study entry count was <150 cells/μL) who were oral 
corticosteroid-dependent. The primary endpoints were proportion of patients who eliminated OCS 
while maintaining asthma control and proportion of patients who achieved a final OCS dose less than 
or equal to 5 mg while maintaining asthma control and taking into account adrenal function. The 
proportion of patients who eliminated maintenance OCS was 62.9%. The proportion of patients who 
achieved an OCS dose less than or equal to 5 mg (while maintaining asthma control and not limited by 
adrenal function) was 81.9%. Effects on OCS reduction were similar irrespective of blood eosinophil 
count at study entry (including patients with blood eosinophils <150 cells/μL) and maintained over an 
additional period of 24 to 32 weeks. The annualised exacerbation rate in Trial 6 was comparable to 
that reported in previous trials.
Long-term extension trials
The long-term efficacy and safety of benralizumab was evaluated in a phase 3, 56-week extension trial 
BORA (Trial 4). The trial enrolled 2123 patients, 2037 adults and 86 adolescent patients (aged 
12 years and older) from Trials 1, 2 and 3. Trial 4 assessed the long-term effect of benralizumab on 
annual exacerbation rate, lung function, ACQ-6, AQLQ(S)+12 and maintenance of OCS reduction at 
the 2 dose regimens studied in the predecessor studies.
At the recommended dose regimen, the reduction in annual rate of exacerbations observed in the 
placebo-controlled predecessor Trials 1 and 2 (in patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts 
≥300 cells/μL who were taking high-dose ICS) was maintained over the second year of treatment
(Table 6). In patients who received benralizumab in predecessor Trials 1 and 2, 73% were 
exacerbation-free in the extension Trial 4.

Predecessor Trial 3 patients who continued benralizumab treatment into Trial 4. Patients were permitted to enter a 
second extension trial after a minimum of 8 weeks in Trial 4 without completing the 56-week extension period.
In Trial 5, a second long-term safety extension study (see section 4.8), the annualised exacerbation rate 
(0.47) in patients receiving the approved dose regimen was comparable to that reported in the 
predecessor Trials 1, 2 (0.65) and 4 (0.48).
Immunogenicity
Overall, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody response developed in 107 out of 809 (13%) patients 
treated with benralizumab at the recommended dose regimen during the 48 to 56 week treatment 
period of the phase 3 placebo-controlled exacerbation trials. Most antibodies were neutralising and 
persistent. Anti-benralizumab antibodies were associated with increased clearance of benralizumab 
and increased blood eosinophil levels in patients with high anti-drug antibody titres compared to 
antibody negative patients; in rare cases, blood eosinophil levels returned to pre-treatment levels. 
Based on current patient follow-up, no evidence of an association of anti-drug antibodies with efficacy 
or safety was observed.
Following a second year of treatment of these patients from the phase 3 placebo-controlled trials, an 
additional 18 out of 510 (4%) had newly developed treatment-emergent antibodies. Overall, in patients 
who were anti-drug antibody positive in the predecessor trials, titres remained stable or declined in the 
second year of treatment. No evidence of an association of anti-drug antibodies with efficacy or safety 
was observed.
Paediatric population 
There were 108 adolescents aged 12 to 17 with asthma enrolled in the phase 3 trials (Trial 1: n=53, 
Trial 2: n=55). Of these, 46 received placebo, 40 received benralizumab every 4 weeks for 3 doses, 
followed by every 8 weeks thereafter, and 22 received benralizumab every 4 weeks. In these trials, the 
asthma exacerbation rate in adolescent patients treated with benralizumab administered at the 
recommended dose regimen was 0.70 (n=40, 95% CI: 0.42, 1.18) compared to 0.41 for placebo (n=46, 
95% CI: 0.23, 0.73) [rate ratio 1.70, 95% CI: 0.78, 3.69]. 
Adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 (n=86) from Trials 1 and 2 continued treatment with benralizumab
in Trial 4 for up to 108 weeks. Efficacy and safety were consistent with the predecessor trials.
13
 
 
In an open-label, uncontrolled pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of 48 weeks duration in a 
limited number of patients 6 to 11 years (n=28) with uncontrolled severe asthma, the magnitude of 
blood eosinophil depletion was similar to adults and adolescents. 
No conclusion can be drawn regarding asthma efficacy in the paediatric population (see section 4.2).
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with
benralizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in asthma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of benralizumab were dose-proportional in patients with asthma following 
subcutaneous administration over a dose range of 2 to 200 mg.
Absorption
Following subcutaneous administration to patients with asthma, the absorption half-life was 3.5 days. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated absolute bioavailability was 
approximately 59% and there was no clinically relevant difference in relative bioavailability in the 
administration to the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. 
Distribution
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, central and peripheral volume of distribution of 
benralizumab was 3.1 L and 2.5 L, respectively, for a 70 kg individual.
Biotransformation
Benralizumab is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is degraded by proteolytic enzymes 
widely distributed in the body and not restricted to hepatic tissue.
Elimination
From population pharmacokinetic analysis, benralizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics and no 
evidence of target receptor-mediated clearance pathway. The estimated systemic clearance (CL) for 
benralizumab was at 0.29 L/d. Following subcutaneous administration, the elimination half-life was 
approximately 15.5 days.
Special populations
Elderly (≥65 years old)
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age did not affect benralizumab clearance. However, 
no data are available in patients over 75 years of age.
Paediatric population
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis and clinical study data, the pharmacokinetics of 
benralizumab in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years were consistent with adults after 
accounting for bodyweight as applicable (see section 4.2).
Gender, race
A population pharmacokinetics analysis, indicated that there was no significant effect of gender and 
race on benralizumab clearance.
Renal impairment
No formal clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment on 
benralizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, benralizumab clearance was comparable 
14
in subjects with creatinine clearance values between 30 and 80 mL/min and patients with normal renal 
function. There are limited data available in subjects with creatinine clearance values less than 
30 mL/min; however, benralizumab is not cleared renally.
Hepatic impairment
No formal clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on 
benralizumab. IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathway; change in 
hepatic function is not expected to influence benralizumab clearance. Based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, baseline hepatic function biomarkers (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) had no 
clinically relevant effect on benralizumab clearance. 
Interaction
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, commonly co-administered medicinal products 
(montelukast, paracetamol, proton pump inhibitors, macrolides and theophylline/aminophylline) had 
no effect on benralizumab clearance in patients with asthma. 
5.3
Preclinical safety data
As benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody, no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been 
conducted.
Animal toxicology and/or pharmacology
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology or repeated dose toxicity studies in monkeys. Intravenous and subcutaneous 
administration to cynomolgus monkeys was associated with reductions in peripheral blood and bone 
marrow eosinophil counts, with no toxicological findings.
Pregnancy
In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, there were no 
benralizumab-related maternal, embryo-foetal, or postnatal effects observed.
Fertility
No dedicated animal studies have been conducted. No benralizumab-related impairment was observed 
in reproductive parameters of male and female cynomolgus monkeys. Examination of surrogate 
fertility parameters (including organ weights and histopathology of reproductive tissues) in animals 
treated with benralizumab suggested no impairment of fertility. However, in the offspring of monkeys 
dosed while pregnant, there was a reduction in eosinophils.

How to store Fasenra
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fasenra is and what it is used for   
What Fasenra is
Fasenra contains the active substance benralizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
that recognises and attaches to a specific target substance in the body. The target of benralizumab is a 
protein called interleukin-5 receptor, which is found particularly on a type of white blood cell called an 
eosinophil.
What Fasenra is used for
Fasenra is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adults. Eosinophilic asthma is a type of asthma 
where patients have too many eosinophils in the blood or lungs. 
Fasenra is used together with other medicines to treat asthma (high doses of ‘corticosteroid inhalers’
plus other asthma medicines) when the disease is not well controlled by those other medicines alone. 
How Fasenra works
Eosinophils are white blood cells involved in asthma inflammation. By attaching to the eosinophils, 
Fasenra helps to reduce their numbers and inflammation. 
What are the benefits of using Fasenra
Fasenra may reduce the number of asthma attacks you are experiencing, help you breathe better and 
decrease your asthma symptoms. If you are taking medicines called ‘oral corticosteroids’, using
Fasenra may also allow you to reduce the daily dose or stop the oral corticosteroids you need to 
control your asthma.
2. What you need to know before you use Fasenra
Do not use Fasenra:

If you are allergic to benralizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you think this applies to you.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Fasenra:
31


if you have a parasitic infection or if you live in an area where parasitic infections are common 
or you are travelling to such a region. This medicine may weaken your ability to fight certain 
types of parasitic infections.
if you have had an allergic reaction to an injection or medicine in the past (see section 4 for 
symptoms of an allergic reaction).
Also, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist when you are given Fasenra:


if your asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine.
if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction (see section 4). Allergic reactions have 
occurred in patients receiving this medicine. 
Fasenra is not a rescue medicine. Do not use it to treat a sudden asthma attack.
Look out for signs of serious allergic reactions 
Fasenra can potentially cause serious allergic reactions. You must look out for signs of these reactions 
(such as hives, rash, breathing problems, fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded and/or swelling of 
your face, tongue or mouth) while you are taking Fasenra.
It is important that you talk to your doctor about how to recognise early symptoms of serious allergic 
reactions and how to manage these reactions if they occur.
Other medicines for asthma
Do not suddenly stop taking or change the dose of your preventer medicines for your asthma once 
you have started Fasenra. 
If your response to the treatment allows it, your doctor may try to reduce the dose of some of these 
medicines, especially ones called ‘corticosteroids’. This should be done gradually and under the direct 
supervision of your doctor.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 18 because the safety and benefits of this 
medicine are not known in this population. 
Other medicines and Fasenra
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines before using 
Fasenra.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Do not use Fasenra if you are pregnant unless your doctor tells you otherwise. It is not known whether 
Fasenra could harm your unborn baby. 
It is not known whether the ingredients of Fasenra can pass into breast milk. If you are 
breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, talk to your doctor. 
Driving and using machines
It is unlikely that Fasenra will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
3.
How to use Fasenra
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist if you are not sure.
32
The recommended dose is an injection of 30 mg. The first 3 injections are every 4 weeks. After this, 
injections are 30 mg every 8 weeks. 
Fasenra is given as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). You and your doctor or nurse 
should decide if you should inject Fasenra yourself. You should not inject Fasenra yourself if you have 
not received Fasenra previously and if you had previous allergic reaction with Fasenra.
You or your caregiver should receive training on the right way to inject Fasenra. Read the 
‘Instructions for Use’ for the pre-filled syringe carefully before using Fasenra.
If you forget to use Fasenra
If you have forgotten to inject a dose of Fasenra, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as 
possible.
Stopping treatment with Fasenra
Do not stop treatment with Fasenra unless your doctor advises you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Fasenra may cause your asthma symptoms and attacks to come back.
If your asthma symptoms get worse while receiving injections of Fasenra, call your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Serious allergic reactions
Seek medical attention immediately if you think you may be having an allergic reaction. Such 
reactions may happen within hours or days after the injection.   
Not known (the frequency cannot be estimated from the available data):

anaphylaxis
symptoms usually include: 
o swelling of your face, tongue, or mouth 
o breathing problems
o fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded (due to a drop in blood pressure)
Common (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people):

Grasp the syringe body (not the plunger) to remove the pre-filled 
syringe.
Look at the liquid through the viewing window. The liquid should 
be clear and colourless to yellow. It may contain small white particles.
Do not inject Fasenra if the liquid is cloudy, discoloured, or contains 
large particles.
You may see a small air bubble in the liquid. This is normal. You do 
not need to do anything about it.

Step 4 - Choose the injection site
The recommended injection site is the front of your thigh.
You may also use the lower part of your abdomen.
Do not inject:
into the 5 cm area around your belly-button

 where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard


into scars or damaged skin
through clothing
A caregiver may inject you in the upper-arm, thigh, or 
abdomen. Do not try to inject yourself in the arm.
For each injection, choose a different site that is at least 3 cm 
away from where you last injected.
Step 5 - Clean the injection site
Wash your hands well with soap and water.
Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe in a circular motion. 
Let it air dry.
Do not touch the cleaned area before injecting.
Do not fan or blow on the cleaned area.
Step 6 - Pull off the needle cover
Hold the syringe body with 1 hand, and carefully pull the needle 
cover straight off with your other hand.
Do not hold the plunger or plunger head while removing the needle 
cover.

place or if the needle is damaged or dirty.
Do not touch the needle, or let it touch any surface. 
Go straight on to the next steps, without delay.
39
Step 7 - Inject Fasenra
Hold the pre-filled syringe in 1 hand as shown. 
Use your other hand to gently pinch and hold the area of skin 
where you want to inject. This creates a firmer surface.

Use your thumb to push down 
on the plunger head. 
Keep pushing until it is down 
as far as it will go. This is to 
make sure you inject all of the 
medication.
Keep your thumb pressed down 
on the plunger head as you take 
the needle out of the skin.
Slowly ease up on the plunger 
until the needle guard covers 
the needle.
Step 8 - Check the injection site

How to use Fasenra Pen
Possible side effects 
How to store Fasenra Pen
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fasenra is and what it is used for   
What Fasenra is
Fasenra contains the active substance benralizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
that recognises and attaches to a specific target substance in the body. The target of benralizumab is a 
protein called interleukin-5 receptor, which is found particularly on a type of white blood cell called an 
eosinophil.
What Fasenra is used for
Fasenra is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adults. Eosinophilic asthma is a type of asthma 
where patients have too many eosinophils in the blood or lungs. 
Fasenra is used together with other medicines to treat asthma (high doses of ‘corticosteroid inhalers’
plus other asthma medicines) when the disease is not well controlled by those other medicines alone. 
How Fasenra works
Eosinophils are white blood cells involved in asthma inflammation. By attaching to the eosinophils, 
Fasenra helps to reduce their numbers and inflammation. 
What are the benefits of using Fasenra
Fasenra may reduce the number of asthma attacks you are experiencing, help you breathe better and 
decrease your asthma symptoms. If you are taking medicines called ‘oral corticosteroids’, using
Fasenra may also allow you to reduce the daily dose or stop the oral corticosteroids you need to 
control your asthma.
2. What you need to know before you use Fasenra
Do not use Fasenra:

If you are allergic to benralizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you think this applies to you.
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Fasenra:
42


if you have a parasitic infection or if you live in an area where parasitic infections are common 
or you are travelling to such a region. This medicine may weaken your ability to fight certain 
types of parasitic infections,
if you have had an allergic reaction to an injection or medicine in the past (see section 4 for 
symptoms of an allergic reaction).
Also, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist when you are given Fasenra:


if your asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine.
if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction (see section 4). Allergic reactions have 
occurred in patients receiving this medicine. 
Fasenra is not a rescue medicine. Do not use it to treat a sudden asthma attack.
Look out for signs of serious allergic reactions 
Fasenra can potentially cause serious allergic reactions. You must look out for signs of these reactions 
(such as hives, rash, breathing problems, fainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded and/or swelling of 
your face, tongue or mouth) while you are taking Fasenra.
It is important that you talk to your doctor about how to recognise early symptoms of serious allergic 
reactions and how to manage these reactions if they occur.
Other medicines for asthma
Do not suddenly stop taking or change the dose of your preventer medicines for your asthma once 
you have started Fasenra. 
If your response to the treatment allows it, your doctor may try to reduce the dose of some of these 
medicines, especially ones called ‘corticosteroids’. This should be done gradually and under the direct 
supervision of your doctor.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children below the age of 18 because the safety and benefits of this 
medicine are not known in this population. 
Other medicines and Fasenra
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines before using 
Fasenra.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Do not use Fasenra if you are pregnant unless your doctor tells you otherwise. It is not known whether 
Fasenra could harm your unborn baby. 
It is not known whether the ingredients of Fasenra can pass into breast milk. If you are 
breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, talk to your doctor. 
Driving and using machines
It is unlikely that Fasenra will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
3.
How to use Fasenra Pen
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist if you are not sure.
43
The recommended dose is an injection of 30 mg. The first 3 injections are every 4 weeks. After this, 
injections are 30 mg every 8 weeks. 
Fasenra is given as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). You and your doctor or nurse 
should decide if you should inject Fasenra yourself. You should not inject Fasenra yourself if you have 
not received Fasenra previously and if you had previous allergic reaction with Fasenra.
You or your caregiver should receive training on the right way to inject Fasenra. Read the 
‘Instructions for Use’ for the Fasenra Pen carefully before using Fasenra.
If you forget to use Fasenra
If you have forgotten to inject a dose of Fasenra, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as 
possible.
Stopping treatment with Fasenra
Do not stop treatment with Fasenra unless your doctor advises you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Fasenra may cause your asthma symptoms and attacks to come back.
If your asthma symptoms get worse while receiving injections of Fasenra, call your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
4.

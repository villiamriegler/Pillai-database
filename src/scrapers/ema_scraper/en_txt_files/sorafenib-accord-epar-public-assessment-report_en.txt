2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that decreases tumour cell proliferation in vitro. Sorafenib inhibits tumour 
growth  of  a  broad  spectrum  of  human  tumour  xenografts  in  athymic  mice  accompanied  by  a  reduction  of 
tumour angiogenesis. Sorafenib inhibits the activity of targets present in the tumour cell (CRAF, BRAF, V600E 
BRAF, c-KIT, and FLT-3) and in the tumour vasculature (CRAF, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2

(VEGFR-2),  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  receptor-3  (VEGFR-3),  and  PDGFR-ß).  RAF  kinases  are 
serine/threonine  kinases,  whereas  c-KIT,  FLT-3,  VEGFR-2,  VEGFR-3,  and  PDGFR-ß  are  receptor  tyrosine 
kinases. 
The  pharmacotherapeutic  group  of  Sorafenib  is  Antineoplastic  agents,  protein  kinase  inhibitors,  ATC  code: 
L01EX02  
This centralized application concerns a generic application according to article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
for Sorafenib Accord 200 mg film-coated tablets. The applicant is Accord Healthcare S.L.U. 
The originator product is Nexavar 200 mg film coated tablets, marketed by Bayer AG and registered within the 
community  since  19  July  2006.  A  pilot  bioequivalence  (BE)  study  was  carried  out  using  the  originator  as 
reference product sourced from Germany (Study Number 0320-20).

Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 1H and 
13C NMR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, FT-IR study and mass spectrometry. The solid state properties of the 
active substance were measured by thermal analysis (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). 
The active substance, sorafenib tosilate, is a white or slightly yellowish or brownish powder. It is practically 
insoluble in water, slightly soluble in anhydrous ethanol and practically insoluble in heptane. Sorafenib tosilate 
has a non-chiral molecular structure, therefore does not show any optical isomerism. It is not hygroscopic and 
is classified as a BCS Class II compound with a low solubility and high permeability.  
According to the literature sorafenib tosilate exhibits different polymorphisms (Form I, Form II, Form III).The 
polymorphic  form  produced  by  the  active  substance  manufacturer  has  been  described.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the proposed manufacturing process consistently produces this form. This form is shown 
stable and does not convert during manufacturing process or storage. Polymorphic form is routinely controlled 
by PXRD as part of the active substance specification. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is supported by an ASMF. Sorafenib tosilate is manufactured using well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications by one manufacturer, and all steps are performed at the same site. 
The manufacturing process is described in three steps, two synthetic and one final salification step where the 
tosilate salt is formed. Micronisation is performed at the active substance manufacturer to achieve the required 
particle size. 
During the procedure, two major objections (MOs) were raised related to the control and acceptability of the 
starting materials. As a response, the overall control strategy related to the proposed starting materials has 
been significantly improved and specification limits for impurities tightened and adequately justified. Based on 
the  improved  control  strategy  and  confirmation  of  the  commercial  availability,  the  starting  materials  are 
considered justified and in line with ICH Q11 and are accepted by the CHMP.  
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. A MO was raised regarding the alkyl tosilate impurities origin, related test method 
and lack of set specifications. The applicant has provided additional information on the origin and justified the 
CHMP Assessment Report

Page 10/25 
 
 
 
 
use of in-house HPLC method instead of Ph. Eur. method. Limits have been added to the specification and skip-
test justified, leading to a resolution of the MO.  
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene bags, placed in triple laminated bag, and finally placed 
in a HDPE container. The material complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
2.2.2.3.  Specification(s) 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, solubility (Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, HPLC), 
para toluene sulfonic acid content (in-house/Ph. Eur.), water content (coulometric titration, Ph. Eur.), sulphated 
ash  (Ph.  Eur.),  related  substances  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  polymorphic  identification 
(PXRD),  particle  size  (in-house),  content  of  methyl,  ethyl  and  isopropyl  P-toluene  sulphonate  (in-house/Ph. 
Eur.). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding the  reference  standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  for  three  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  from  the  active  substance 
manufacturer  and  two  from  the  finished  product  manufacturer  are  provided.  The  results  are  within  the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. Monograph 
(04/2021:2931). The applicant adopted the Ph. Eur. monograph and its methods except for tosilate esters. For 
testing of tosilate esters, the in-house quantitative method is used and validated. The batch data comparison 
is provided, and the methods can be considered equivalent.  
The proposed active substance specification is in line with the Ph. Eur. monograph for sorafenib tosilate, or 
contains tighter limits (impurities A, D, and unspecified impurities) than stated in the monograph. Additional 
specifications  have  been  set  for  the  para  toluene  sulfonic  acid  content,  residual  solvents,  polymorphic 
identification and methyl, ethyl and isopropyl P-toluene sulphonate content. All additional methods have been 
adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2.  
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 60 months under long 
term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to 6 months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity, water content, impurities, assay and polymorphic 
identification. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications, with no noticeable trends in any of the quality attributes 
tested, including polymorphic form. is the same results are additionally confirmed by the stability data of one 
micronised batch. 
CHMP Assessment Report 
EMA/834802/2022 
Page 11/25 
 
 
 
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  performed  on  1  batch.  The  substance  is  not 
photosensitive. Results on stress conditions (elevated temperature and relative humidity, water, acid and base 
hydrolysis,  oxidation)  were  also  provided.  The  active  substance  is  found  stable  under  thermal  and  relative 
humidity  conditions  and  after  exposure  to  water  hydrolysis  and  is  sensitive  to  acid,  base  and  oxidation 
conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed container without 
specific storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a 200 mg film-coated tablet. Tablets are red, round, biconvex, bevel-edged, 12.0 mm 
in diameter, debossed with “H1” on one side and plain on other side. Each tablet contains 44.3% of the active 
substance as tosilate salt or 32% of Sorafenib. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a generic product similar to the reference 
product. The first step of the development was to explore physical and chemical characteristics of the 
reference product. The reference product Nexavar 200 mg film-coated tablets was evaluated for chemical 
characteristics such as assay, related substances and dissolution. The same excipients as those used in the 
reference product were selected and various studies performed to optimise the formulation and the process 
parameters, as summarised below.  
The  manufacturing  process  development  is  considered  as  standard,  no  Quality  by  Design  (QbD)  or  Design 
space is used. Different formulations were made where dissolution, disintegration, and resistance to crushing 
were used to guide the development. Trails were taken, observing the effect of using different quantities of 
disintegrant,  binder,  lubricant  and  water  of  granulation.  Manufacturing  process  studies  were  undertaken  to 
optimise  the  process.  Development  batches  were  made  at  different  conditions  (differences  in  granulation, 
blending  and  lubrication  time,  binder  addition,  kneading  time)  and  tested  for  physical  characteristics, 
dissolution  and  blend  uniformity.  Additionally,  the  compression  machine  speed  challenge  was  performed  to 
evaluate  the  effect  of  machine  speed  on  physicochemical  characteristics  of  the  tablets  and  the  hardness 
challenge was performed to evaluate the effect of compression force. To evaluate impact of active substance 
particle size distribution (PSD), trials were taken with active substance with different PSD. Within the specified 
PSD acceptance criteria, no significant impact on dissolution was observed. The particle size specification for 
active substance is set in line with biobatch data and trend results of the production scale active substance 
batches.  
One  of  the  main objectives  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  designing  a  suitable  and  discriminatory 
dissolution QC method. The pH-solubility profile indicated very low solubility of sorafenib tosilate in the different 
studied media.. Different concentrations of the surfactant were studied and a complete release was observed 
with the selected concentration of surfactant. Based on the studied data, the QC dissolution methods conditions 
were defined . 
The bioequivalence study was performed between the reference product Nexavar 200 mg film-coated tablets 
and the test product Sorafenib Tablets 200 mg. Based on the presented bioequivalence study the test product 
CHMP Assessment Report 
EMA/834802/2022 
Page 12/25 
 
 
 
 
is considered bioequivalent with the reference product. The formulation used in the study was the same as that 
intended for marketing and was made according to the proposed manufacturing process. The formulation of 
the test product has the same composition as the reference product, same excipients are used.   
Dissolution profiles of the products used in the bioequivalence study have been compared in 900 ml 0.1N HCl, 
acetate  buffer  (pH  4.5)  and  phosphate  buffer  (pH  6.8)  with  surfactant,  applying  f2  statistics  method.  The 
dissolution profiles of the test and reference product were demonstrated similar over the physiological range 
and in the proposed QC method. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
After submission of the MAA the Ph. Eur. finished product monograph for sorafenib tablets (01/2022:3022) 
was published, hence, a MO was raised requesting to demonstrate that the proposed method complies with 
the Ph. Eur. dissolution method or, alternatively, to adopt it. Additionally, the same MO, requested to set the 
dissolution acceptance criteria on the biobatch and in line with the EMA´s reflection paper on the dissolution 
specification for generic solid oral immediate release products with systemic action 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017. As a response, the applicant adopted the Ph. Eur. method for 
dissolution and tested the finished product in line with the Ph. Eur. method, demonstrating compliance with 
the Ph. Eur. monograph for sorafenib tablets. for release and shelf-life specifications. Adopting the Ph. Eur. 
dissolution method and tightening of the dissolution acceptance criteria resulted in resolution of the major 
objection.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, with exception of the film-coating material ferricoxide (E172), which is compliant with the EU food 
regulation. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. A detailed compatibility 
study was performed where the active substance was mixed with an excipient and stored. Compatibility has 
been sufficiently demonstrated and supported with the long term and accelerated stability data. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report.  
The  polymorphic  form  of  the  active  substance  in  the  finished  product  was  monitored  for  6  months  at 
40°C/75%RH  and  compared  with  the  placebo  and  active  substance.  It  was  confirmed  that  the  polymorphic 
form is stable and does not convert during the manufacturing process or storage. 
Primary  packaging  material  selection  was  based  on  similar  product  development  experience  and  stability 
studies. The primary packaging is Aluminium-Aluminium perforated unit dose blister as stated in the SmPC. 
The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of following main steps: co-sifting, dry mixing, wet granulation, drying, 
sifting/milling, blending, lubrication, compression, film-coating and packaging. The process is considered to be 
a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three production scale batches. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and 
pharmaceutical form.

HPLC  (Ph.  Eur.),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  by  mass  variation  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  by  HPLC  (Ph.  Eur.)  and 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
As a Ph.  Eur. monograph for the active substance and finished product are now available, a MO was raised 
regarding  the  used  in-house  analytical  methods  and  proposed  finished  product  specifications.  The  applicant 
was asked to demonstrate equivalence of the in-house methods with the Ph. Eur. methods or to adopt the Ph. 
Eur. methods. Additionally, the finished product specifications were asked to be set in compliance with the Ph. 
Eur. finished product monograph for sorafenib tablets (01/2022:3022). The MO was resolved, as the applicant 
adopted the Ph. Eur. monograph methods and specifications.  
The finished product specification covers appropriate parameters for this dosage form and comply with the Ph. 
Eur.  monograph  Sorafenib  tablets  (01/2022:3022).  The  dissolution  acceptance  criteria  are  tighter  in 
comparison to the monograph, set in line with the biobatch. The batch analysis results show that the finished 
product meets the proposed specification and the Ph. Eur. monograph. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment it can be 
concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed  considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in  line  with  the  “Questions  and  answers  for 
marketing  authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/409815/2020)  and  the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific 
control measures are deemed necessary. 
The  analytical  methods  are  adopted  from  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  for  sorafenib  tablets  (01/2022:3022), 
including quantitative methods for dissolution, assay and related substances. Satisfactory information regarding 
the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  three  production  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long 
term  conditions  (25°C  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40°C  /  75%  RH) 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  the  finished  product  are  identical  to  those 
proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples  were 
CHMP Assessment Report 
EMA/834802/2022 
Page 14/25 
 
 
 
tested  for  water  content,  dissolution,  related  substances,  assay  and  microbiological  quality.  The  analytical 
methods  used  are  stability  indicating.  No  significant  changes  have  been  observed  in  any  of  the  parameters 
tested  at  the  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions.  Minor  fluctuations  have  been  observed  for  the  water 
content; however, the values are well within the set specifications and considered stable. Further, three bulk 
storage  batches  have  been  added  to  the  stability  program,  packed  in  triple  laminated  aluminium  bag.  The 
stability data shows that the bulk is stable for 12 months at long term conditions and 6 months at accelerated 
conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. No changes were observed, the finished product is not photosensitive. A forced 
degradation study (acid, base, oxidative, heat, humidity, photolytic and metal ions degradation) was carried 
out as part of the analytical method validation in order to prove the specificity of the HPLC method for assay 
and  related  substances  in  the  finished  product,  and  therefore  the  stability  indicating  capability  of  those 
methods.  The  product  is  stable  towards  degradation,  supported  by  low  values  for  impurities.  No  significant 
degradation  was  observed  under  the  acid,  base,  oxidative,  heat,  humidity,  photolytic  and  metal  ions 
degradation  conditions.  The  results  from  the  forced  degradation  study  demonstrate  that  the  methods  are 
stability indicating.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and section 6.4) is acceptable.

N/A 
2.2.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The active substance (sorafenib tosilate) and the finished product sorafenib tablets are subject of a Ph. Eur. 
Monograph, with which they comply. The finished product has been developed as a generic of Nexavar 200 mg 
film-coated tablets.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance 
in clinical use.  
The MOs relating to the choice of starting materials were resolved based on the improved control strategy and 
confirmation of the commercial availability. The MO regarding the active substance impurities was resolved by 
providing  additional  information  on  origin,  applying  additional  control  strategy,  and  providing  adequate 
justification  of  the  used  method.  Finally,  during  the  procedure,  the  applicant  has  adopted  Ph.  Eur.  finished 
product  monograph  for  Sorafenib  tablets  and  tightened  dissolution  acceptance  criteria,  to  resolve  the  MOs 
related to the finished product.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  has  been  provided,  which  is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The  non-clinical  aspects  of  the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of sorafenib are well known. As sorafenib is a 
widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant has not provided additional studies and further studies 
are not required. Overview based on literature review is, thus, appropriate 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Sorafenib Accord by Accord Healthcare S.L.U., Spain is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase 
in the combined sales volumes for all sorafenib containing products and the exposure of the environment to 
the active substances. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is adequate. The 
application contains an adequate review of published non-clinical data.  
The non-clinical sections of the SmPC are in line to that of the brand leader product. 
There are no objections to the approval of Sorafenib Accord from a non-clinical point of view.

of the clinical phase of the study successfully. 
Analytical methods 
A validated LC-MS/MS method, using protein precipitation method for extraction, was used to determine 
Sorafenib concentrations in K2EDTA human plasma.  
The internal standard was Sorafenib 13CD3. Certificates of analysis were provided for the analyte and the 
internal standard. 
The calibration curve range during study sample analysis was from 20.003 to 6003.476 ng/ml. The quality 
control concentrations (ng/ml) were LOQ QC = 20.881, LQC = 59.660, INTQC = 180.242, LMQC = 870.737, 
MQC = 1892.906, HQC = 4792.166 and DQC = 17990.929. 
Accuracy and precision of QC samples for sorafenib obtained during analysis of subject samples is shown 
below: 
Table 1 
A total of 5592 samples were analysed. The Number of reinjections was 153. Two (02) samples (0.04%) were 
reanalysed  due  to  following  reasons:  1)  Concentration  above  highest  standard  2)  Significant  variations  in 
response of internal standard. For incurred sample reanalysis 358 samples were run. 100 % of samples were 
found to be within a variation of 20% from the mean value. Long term stability at -65 ± 10°C was proven for 
a period that spanned the time from first study sample collection to completion of ISR analysis.  
Pharmacokinetic variables 
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  calculated  from  the  plasma  concentration  vs.  time  profile  by  non-
compartmental model using Phoenix® WinNonlin® Version 8.1 (Certara L.P.) for sorafenib.  
Primary pharmacokinetic parameters were Cmax and AUC0-72 
Secondary pharmacokinetic parameter was Tmax 
Statistical methods 
PROC GLM of SAS® Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., USA) was employed for statistical analysis. ANOVA was 
performed on ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-72. 
ANOVA model included Sequence, Subject (Sequence), Formulation and Period as fixed effects. The ln-
transformed pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC0-72) of Sorafenib were analysed using an ANOVA 
model at alpha 0.05.

Bioequivalence criteria: 
Based on the statistical results of 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the geometric least squares means 
for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-72; conclusion was drawn for Test Product-T 
vs. Reference Product-R for Sorafenib with following considerations: 
For AUC0-72: If the 90% confidence interval of geometric least square mean ratio of Test to Reference falls 
within the acceptance range of 80.00–125.00% for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter AUC0-72. 
For Cmax: 
1) If within-reference intra-subject CV of ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax ≤ 30% then 
bioequivalence of the test product with that of the reference product was concluded, if the 90% confidence 
interval fell within the acceptance range of 80.00–125.00% for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter 
Cmax. 
2) If within-reference intra-subject CV of ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax > 30% then BE 
limit was widen using scaled-average bioequivalence. Under scaled-average-bioequivalence, [U, L] = exp 
[±k·SWR], where U was the upper limit of the acceptance range, L was the lower limit of the acceptance 
range k was the regulatory constant set to 0.760 and SWR was the within-subject standard deviation of the 
ln transformed values of Cmax of the reference product. 
3) If within-reference intra-subject CV of ln-transformed Cmax ≥ 50% then Cmax limit was widen maximum 
up to 69.84 to 143.19%. 
Bioequivalence of the test product with that of the reference product was concluded for Cmax, if both of the 
following conditions were satisfied: 
i) 
The 90% confidence interval for ln-transformed data of Cmax fell within the newly widen range 
[U, L] = exp [±k·SWR], which was based upon the within-subject variability of reference product 
observed for Cmax. 
ii) 
ii) The geometric least square mean ratio (GMR) of test to reference for Cmax fell within the 
acceptance range of 80.00–125.00%.

The acceptance criteria for Cmax were widened based on the extent of the intra-subject standard deviation of 
the ln-transformed value of Cmax of the reference product observed. The study confirmed high intra-subject 
variability of Cmax for the test and reference product. However, widened acceptance criteria were not necessary 
as all results fell within the conventional acceptance criteria of 80.00-125.00% for Cmax.  
In addition, the test to reference ratio of geometric least squares means with corresponding 90% CI was within 
the  acceptance  range  of  80.00  to  125.00%  for  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic  parameter  AUC0-72  for 
Sorafenib. 
The bioequivalence of test product Sorafenib Tablets 200 mg and reference product Nexavar® tablets 200 mg 
of Bayer AG, Germany has formally been shown.

2.4.2.2.  Pharmacokinetic conclusion   
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  the  test  product  Sorafenib  Tablets  200  mg  is  considered 
bioequivalent with reference product Nexavar® tablets 200 mg of Bayer AG, Germany.   
2.4.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.2.4.  <Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
One  bioequivalence  study  was  submitted  for  the  one  strength  of  200  mg  film-coated  tablets  of  sorafenib 
applied. The study was open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence, single 
oral  dose,  fully  replicate,  crossover,  and  conducted under  fasting  conditions  in  line  with  product-specific  BE 
guidance  for  Sorafenib  film-coated  tablets  200  mg.  The  analysis  was  done  on  the  parent  analyte,  with  a 
validated LS-MS/MS method, according to the Guideline on bioanalytical method validation.  
The acceptance criteria for Cmax were widened based on the extent of the intra-subject standard deviation of 
the ln-transformed value of Cmax of the reference product observed. The study confirmed high intra-subject 
variability of Cmax for the test and reference product. However, widened acceptance criteria were not necessary 
as  all  results  fell  within  the  conventional  acceptance  criteria  of  80.00-125.00%  for  Cmax.  Also,  the  test  to 
reference ratio of geometric least squares means with corresponding 90% CI was within the acceptance range 
of 80.00 to 125.00% for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter AUC0-72 for Sorafenib. 
The study sites have been extensively inspected. The Applicant has discussed the critical and major findings 
observed in recent inspection by AEMPS, Spain in 2019 and the relevance for the submitted study. No impact 
has been identified to current study.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data and the bioequivalence has formally been 
shown between the test product Sorafenib Tablets 200 mg and the reference product Nexavar® tablets 200 
mg of Bayer AG, Germany.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of sorafenib (as tosilate) 200 mg film coated tablets. The reference 
product Nexavar is indicated for: 
Hepatocellular carcinoma 
Nexavar is indicated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma 
Renal cell carcinoma 
Nexavar  is  indicated  for  the  treatment of  patients with  advanced  renal  cell  carcinoma  who have  failed prior 
interferon-alpha or interleukin-2 based therapy or are considered unsuitable for such therapy. 
Differentiated thyroid cancer 
Nexavar  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patinets  with  progressive,  locally  advanced  or  metastatic, 
differentiated (papillary/follicular/Hurthle cell) thyroid carcinoma, refractory to radioactive iodine.  
CHMP Assessment Report 
EMA/834802/2022 
Page 23/25 
 
 
 
-  However orphan drug exclusivity has been granted for follicular thyroid cancer and papillary thyroid 
cancer till May 27, 2024. Hence the thyroid cancer related indication was carved out from the proposed 
product information and this application.  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available non-
clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered enough. From a clinical perspective, 
this  application  does  not  contain  new  data  on  the  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  as  well  as  the 
efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on 
information from published literature is considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, 
four-period,  two-sequence,  single  oral  dose,  fully  replicate,  crossover,  bioequivalence  study  comparing  two 
sorafenib  200  mg  film-coated  tablet  formulations  in 64  healthy  adult  subjects under  fasting  conditions.  The 
study  was  conducted  under  standardised  conditions.  Sorafenib  was  measured  in  human  plasma  using  a 
validated LC-MS/MS method. 
The  application  contains  adequate  quality  data  and  adequate  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  and  the 
bioequivalence has been shown.  
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
Having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen  reference  medicinal 
product,  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Sorafenib Accord is favourable in the following indication: 
Hepatocellular carcinoma 
Sorafenib Accord is indicated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma  
Renal cell carcinoma 
Sorafenib Accord is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have failed 
prior interferon-alpha or interleukin-2 based therapy or are considered unsuitable for such therapy.

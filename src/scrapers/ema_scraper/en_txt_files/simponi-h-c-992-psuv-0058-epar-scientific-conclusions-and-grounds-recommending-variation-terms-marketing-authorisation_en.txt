Scientific conclusions  
The MAH reviewed within this PSUR reported cases of device failures and adverse events related to the 
auto-injector and maladministration. The vast majority of the 566 cases were non-serious (553/566), 
and all of the device-related events were non-serious. The most frequently reported PTs were Device 
malfunction (75.2%; 497/661) and inappropriate schedule of drug administration 10.6%; (70/661). 
Among the 566 cases, 389 (68.7%) cases also reported the PT Drug dose omission and 57 (8.6%) cases 
also reported Underdose for most events that potentially occurred as a result of the device malfunction. 
The most frequently reported device malfunction or failure issue was the firing of the device, followed by 
issues  with  the  auto-injector  button.  It  was  noted  that  in  at  least  one  case,  there  was  uncertainty 
regarding how to interpret the yellow indicator: “the yellow indicator was only half way up the window 
after  the  injection  and  the  reporter  was  unsure  if  the  full  dose  was  delivered”.  This  issue  has  been 
discussed thoroughly within a PRAC signal procedure regarding Humira (adalimumab), and resulted in 
an  update  of  the  Package  Leaflet,  clarifying  the  functioning  of  the  auto-injector.  The  PRAC 
recommended that a smilar update is implemented for Simponi in the “instructions for administration” 
section  of  the  Package  Leaflet  under  the  heading  “Check  the  window  –  a  yellow  indicator  confirms 
proper administration” by adding the following as bullet points:  
•  The yellow indicator is connected to the plunger of the pre-filled pen. If the yellow indicator is not 
shown in the window, the plunger has not advanced adequately, and the injection has not 
occurred. 
•  The yellow indicator will fill about half of the viewing window. This is normal. 
Therefore, in view of available data, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were 
warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Simponi, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance golimumab is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

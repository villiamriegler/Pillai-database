Kalydeco 
ivacaftor 
On 24 September 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted two positive 
opinions recommending changes to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Kalydeco. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Europe) 
Ltd. 
For the currently available 150 mg film-coated tablets, the CHMP recommended extending the indication to 
include: 
“treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 18 years and older who have an R117H mutation in the 
CFTR gene (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
In addition, the CHMP recommended extending the marketing authorisation for Kalydeco to include two new 
presentations: 50 mg and 75 mg granules in sachet. The granules are for use in children aged 2 years and 
older in the previously authorised indication.  
For information, the full indication for Kalydeco tablets will be: 
“treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older and weighing 25 kg or more  who have 
one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, 
G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
“treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 18 years and older who have an R117H mutation in the 
CFTR gene (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
The full indication for Kalydeco granules will be: 
“treatment of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 2 years and older and weighing less than 25 kg who have 
one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, 
G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).”

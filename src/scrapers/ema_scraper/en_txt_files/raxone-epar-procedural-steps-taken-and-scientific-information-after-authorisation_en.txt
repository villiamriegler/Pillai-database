This is a follow-up study of patients in the Expanded 
Access Program (SNT-EPA-001) for Raxone in the 
treatment of patients with Leber's Hereditary Optic 
Neuropathy (LHON). The goal is to collect further 
long-term real-world efficacy and safety data. Annex 
II is modified accordingly. An updated RMP version 
1.9 submitted accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Annex II and to the Risk Management Plan 
(RMP).

SmPC and PL 
In vivo idebenone is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Data from 
warning in relation to CY3A4 substrates based on the 
final report of study SNT-I-017: An open-label study 
to assess the potential for pre-systemic inhibition of 
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A) by idebenone in 
healthy male subjects using midazolam as a 
substrate. The Package Leaflet was updated 
accordingly. An updated RMP version 1.5 was 
submitted as part of the application. The provision of 
the study report addresses the post-authorisation 
measure MEA 005.1. 
a drug-drug interaction study in 32 healthy volunteers 
indicate that on the first day of oral administration of 300 
mg idebenone t.i.d., the metabolism of midazolam, a 
CYP3A4 substrate, was not modified when both drugs were 
administered together. After repeated administration Cmax 
and AUC of midazolam were increased by 28% and 34%, 
respectively, when midazolam was administered in 
combination with 300 mg idebenone t.i.d. Therefore, 
CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic 
index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, 
cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus,

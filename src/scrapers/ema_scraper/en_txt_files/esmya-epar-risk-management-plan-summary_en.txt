Summary of Risk Management Plan for Esmya (ulipristal acetate) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan  (RMP) for Esmya. The RMP details important 
risks of Esmya, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Esmya's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Esmya's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Esmya should be used.  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of  Esmya's 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Esmya is authorised for intermittent treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids 
in women for whom surgical procedures are contraindicated or have already failed (see Product 
Information for the full indication). It contains ulipristal acetate as the active substance and it is 
given by oral route, 5 mg tablet. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Esmya’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Esmya’s  EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage:

II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks 
Important  risks  of  Esmya,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Esmya's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size, the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The  medicine’s  legal  status,  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Esmya,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Esmya  is  not  yet  available,  it  is  listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Esmya  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
1 
 
 
 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Esmya.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The small number of cases in the clinical trial programme does not allow 
identification of any additional risk group or risk factor (beyond the 
presence of fibroids). In particular, these cases did not display especially 
large myomas nor marked endometrium thickening during treatment. 
The administration of repeated intermittent treatment courses has not shown 
to increase that risk.

Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
- 
Study  PGL18-002,  retrospective,  cohort  study  in  multinational  databases,  an  updated 
feasibility report. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Purpose of the study: to estimate the absolute and relative risk of liver injury with Esmya 
treatment and compare with patients with uterine fibroids not taking Esmya. The feasibility 
assessment of various EU national databases is ongoing, e.g. in United Kingdom (Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)). Based on the feasibility assessment result, the study 
will be conducted or cancelled due to lack of statistical power. 
-  Observational  study  using  EU  registries  with  biomarker  data  e.g.  Pro-EURO  DILI  registry 
and Spanish registry. 
Purpose of the study:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
to describe trends in biomarkers for hepatic injury following exposure to Esmya, 
to  estimate  the  proportion  of  patients  exposed  to  Esmya  that  develop  clinically 
relevant increases in biomarkers for hepatic injury, 
to describe adherence to monitoring of biomarkers for hepatic injury, 
to identify risk factors for DILI. 
-  Genetic analysis (HLA) study using data from EU registries with biomarker data in patients 
with severe DILI in registries such as Spanish registry and the Pro-EURO DILI registry.  
Purpose of the study: to identify patients at risk of DILI. 
- 
- 
PREMIUM (PGL14-001), a prospective, non-interventional study to evaluate the long-term 
safety  of  Esmya,  in  particular  the  endometrial  safety,  and  the  current  prescription  and 
management patterns of Esmya in a long-term treatment setting. 
Purpose of the study: to investigate Esmya use in a ‘real world’ practice. 
Study  PGL18-001,  retrospective  drug  utilisation  study  through  a  chart  review  across  four 
major EU countries. 
Purpose of the study: to measure effectiveness of monitoring of liver parameters in patients 
treated  with  Esmya  in  regular  clinical  practice,  also  an  effectiveness  of  adherence  to 
modified indication and the new contraindication of underlying hepatic disorder.

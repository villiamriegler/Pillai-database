1.  Introduction 
On 03 December 2021, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
Type 1 with One or Two SMN2 Copies, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, 
as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  study  AVXS-101-CL-306,  Phase  3,  Open-Label,  Single-Arm,  Single-Dose  Gene 
Replacement Therapy Clinical Trial for Patients With Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 With One or Two 
SMN2 Copies Delivering AVXS-101 by Intravenous Infusion, is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
AVXS-101  is  a  gene  therapy  biological  product  that  encodes  for  the  human  SMN  (hSMN)  protein. 
AVXS-101  is  comprised  of  a  non-replicating,  non-integrating  recombinant  self-complementary  adeno-
associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) capsid shell containing the cDNA of the human SMN gene under the 
control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/chicken-β-actin-hybrid promoter (CB) as well as 2 AAV 
inverted terminal repeats (ITR) from the AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) DNA. The SMN gene present in AVXS-
101 is designed not to integrate into the patient chromosome, but rather to reside as a DNA episome 
in  the  nucleus  of  transduced  cells.  AVXS-101  contains  no  DNA  from  the  wild-type  AAV9,  rendering 
AVXS-101 incapable of replicating itself. AVXS-101 is designed to increase the expression levels of the 
SMN protein in the motor neurons before the onset of irreversible motor neuron loss.   
AVXS-101 infusion was administered under sterile conditions in a paediatric intensive care unit or other 
appropriate  setting  (e.g.,  interventional  suite,  operating  room,  dedicated  procedure  room)  with 
immediate access to acute critical care management. 
Investigational product provided is listed in Table 1.

•  AVXS-101-CL-306; Phase 3, Open-Label, Single-Arm, Single-Dose Gene Replacement Therapy 
Clinical  Trial  for  Patients  with  Spinal  Muscular  Atrophy  Type  1  with  One  or  Two  SMN2  Copies 
Delivering AVXS-101 by Intravenous Infusion 
2.3.2.  Clinical study  
Description 
This  was  a  Phase  3,  open-label,  single-arm,  single-dose,  gene  replacement  therapy  study  to 
investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  a  single  IV  infusion  of  AVXS-101  (also  known  as  OAV101)  in 
patients  with  SMA  Type  1  with  1  or  2  copies  of  the  SMN2  gene.  Eligible  patients  were  <  6  months 
(< 180 days) of age at the time of administration of AVXS 101 (Day 1). The  study was conducted in 
Asia.  
Methods 
Study participants 
Main Inclusion criteria:  
1.  Patients with SMA Type 1 as determined by diagnosis of SMA based on gene mutation analysis 
with  bi-allelic  SMN1  mutations  (deletion  or  point  mutations)  and  1  or  2  copies  of  SMN2 
(inclusive of the known SMN2 gene modifier mutation (c.859G>C)).  
2.  Patients must be < 6 months (< 180 days) of age at the time of AVXS-101 infusion.  
3.  Patients  must  have  a  swallowing  evaluation  test  performed  prior  to  administration  of  gene 
replacement therapy. 
Main Exclusion criteria:  
1.  Previous, planned or expected scoliosis repair surgery/procedure prior to 18 months of age 
2.  Use  of  invasive  ventilatory  support  (tracheotomy  with  positive  pressure)  or  pulse  oximetry 
< 95% saturation at screening 
a.  Pulse oximetry saturation must not decrease ≥ 4 percentage points between screening 
and dosing with confirmatory oximetry reading 
b.  Patients may have been put on non-invasive ventilatory support for less than 12 hours 
per day at the discretion of their physician or trial staff 
3. 
 Use or requirement of non-invasive ventilatory support for 12 or more hours daily in the two 
weeks prior to dosing 
4. 
 Patient with signs of aspiration based on a swallowing test or whose weight-for-age fell below 
the 3rd percentile based on WHO Child Growth Standards (WHO-MGRS 2006a) and unwilling to 
use an alternative method to oral feeding 
5.  Anti-AAV9  antibody  titre  >  1:50  as  determined  by  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay 
(ELISA)  binding  immunoassay.  If  a  potential  patient  demonstrated  anti-AAV9  antibody  titre 
> 1:50, he or she may have retested within 30 days of the screening period and been eligible 
to participate if the anti-AAV9 antibody titre upon retesting was ≤ 1:50 
6.  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (GGT, ALT, AST, total bilirubin > 2× the ULN, 
creatinine ≥ 1.0 mg/dL, haemoglobin < 8 or > 18 g/dL; WBC > 20,000 per cmm) prior to gene

replacement therapy. Patients with an elevated bilirubin level that was unequivocally the result 
of neonatal jaundice should have not been excluded.  
7.  Patients < 35 weeks gestational age at time of birth 
CHMP comments 
The main inclusion criteria for study CL-306 were identical to the inclusion criteria for the pivotal study 
of the initial MAA (CL-303), which is appreciated. 
The main exclusion criteria are largely comparable to the exclusion criteria used in the pivotal study. 
However, slight differences were observed in exclusion criteria with respect to oxygen saturation and 
use of non-invasive ventilatory support: pulse oximetry could be <95% in the current CL-306 study 
compared to <96% in the pivotal study and use of non-invasive ventilatory support for 12 or more 
hours daily in the 2 weeks prior to screening in the current study compared to <6 hours/day in the 
pivotal trial. This could potentially allow slightly worse patients to be included in the current study, 
which could impact the treatment outcome.  
Of note, the exclusion criteria used in the current study are identical to the exclusion criteria used in 
study AVXS-101-CL-302, which was designed as the European counterpart of the pivotal study CL-303. 
Treatments 
AVXS-101 was delivered one time through a venous catheter inserted into a peripheral limb vein (arm 
or leg) at a dose of 1.1E14 vg/kg. AVXS-101 was slowly infused over approximately 60 minutes.  
In the original protocol, patients were to be given prophylactic prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day starting on 
Day  -1  until  at  least  30  days  post-AVXS-101  infusion.  Patients  enrolled  per  Global  Protocol  v4.0 
Amendment 3 and afterward were to be given prophylactic prednisolone at approximately 2 mg/kg/day 
or an equivalent dose of another glucocorticoid if prednisolone was unavailable or in the opinion of the 
Investigator  prednisolone  was  not  tolerated,  on  Day  -1,  Day  1,  and  Day  2,  and  then  1  mg/kg/day 
starting  on  Day  3  and  until  at  least  30  days  post-AVXS-101  infusion.  After  30  days  post-AVXS-101 
infusion,  the  dose  of  prednisolone  was  tapered  for  patients  whose  GGT,  ALT,  and  AST  values  were 
below the threshold of 2 × ULN. 
CHMP comments 
Patients received a single dose of AVXS-101 at a dose of 1.1 x 1014 vg/kg, which is identical to the 
posology recommended in the SmPC.  
Prophylactic prednisolone treatment in the study was altered during the study to align with the urgent 
safety measure implemented March 2019. Prophylactic prednisolone is used to dampen the immune 
response to the adeno-associated virus (AAV) derived therapy. The SmPC recommends the use of 
1 mg/kg/day prednisolone from 24 hours prior to AVXS-101 treatment to 30 days post infusion. At the 
MAA, it was not considered sufficiently substantiated that a higher dose was more effective in 
suppressing anti-AAV immunity and therefore, the 1 mg/kg/day dose was included in the SmPC, 
however, investigation of a higher dose of prednisolone pretreatment (2 mg/kg/day for the first 3 
days) was agreed. It is expected that if and when evidence to substantiate the 2 mg/kg/day dose is 
available, the applicant will assess whether an amendment of the SmPC is necessary. 
Objectives/Endpoints 
Primary

•  Determine  efficacy  by  demonstrating  achievement  of  developmental  milestone  of  sitting  without 
support  for  at  least  10  seconds  at  18  months  of  age  as  defined  by  WHO  Motor  Developmental 
Milestones. 
Secondary 
•  Determine  efficacy  based  on  survival  at  14  months  of  age.  Survival  is  defined  by  the  avoidance  of 
combined endpoint of either (a) death or (b) permanent ventilation which is defined by tracheostomy 
or  by  the  requirement  of  ≥  16  hours  of  respiratory  assistance  per  day  (via  non-invasive  ventilatory 
support)  for  ≥  14  consecutive  days  in  the  absence  of  an  acute  reversible  illness,  excluding 
perioperative ventilation. Permanent ventilation, so defined, is considered a surrogate for death. 
Exploratory 
• Achievement of motor milestones, CHOP-INTEND scores and Bayley’s scale scores are amongst the 
exploratory endpoints of this study.  
CHMP comments 
The endpoints included in the study are agreed. Scientific advice on the design of Study CL-303 
received on 26 JAN 2017, considered that a primary endpoint of “Independent sitting for at least 10 
seconds at the 18-month study visit” was clinically relevant. In addition, the secondary endpoint of 
event-free survival, with events defined as either death or permanent (≥16 hours per day) ventilatory 
support, at 14 months of age, is a widely recognized and clinically meaningful endpoint.   
The endpoints defined in the current study are identical to the endpoints used for study CL-302.  
Sample size 
The  study  was  originally  designed  to  have  sufficient  power,  when  combined  with  an  identically 
designed  study  AVXS
101
CL
302  (COAV101A12301),  to  establish  efficacy  with  regard  to  the  primary 
and  secondary  endpoints.  Due  to  the  narrowed  scope  in  sample  size  and  change  in  data  analysis  of 
‑
‑
‑
AVXS-101-CL-306 (COAV101A12304), no combined analysis or stand-alone analysis were conducted.  
CHMP comments 
As scope of the study changed and no statistical analysis was planned anymore, sample size 
calculation became superfluous.  
The study changed to an exploratory study. Sample size is limited, but can be accepted based on rarity 
of the disease. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable as this was an open-label, single arm study. 
CHMP comments 
The open-label design without a comparator arm was considered acceptable given the expected effect 
size and well characterized natural history.  
Statistical Methods 
The final analysis was primarily composed by individual data listings and patient profiles after the final 
database lock. No inferential statistical approaches were performed.

CHMP comments 
Only descriptive analyses were performed. Based on sample size (n=2) this is acceptable. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 2 patients were enrolled and received AVXS-101 treatment; both enrolled patients completed 
the study. Three patients failed to be enrolled due to screen failure. No enrolled patients had the SMN2 
gene modifier mutation (c.859G>C) based on genetic reconfirmation. 
CHMP comments 
It is reassuring that both participants enrolled in the study completed the study. 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 1 study centre. in. 
First participant first visit was on 31 May 2019 and last subject last visit took place on 29 Jun 2021. 
Baseline data 
The demographic and baseline characteristic for the Safety population are summarized in Table 2. 
Both patients had biallelic deletion mutations of SMN1 (exon 7/8 common homozygous deletions) and 
2  copies  of  SMN2.  Subject  displayed  hypotonia  at  baseline,  while  subject  displayed  both  absence  of 
deep tendon reflex and hypotonia. 
Table 2 Demographic and baseline characteristics 
CHMP comments 
Both participants were symptomatic at baseline, had bi-allelic deletion of the SMN1 gene and 2 copies 
of the SMN2 gene. Both displayed symptoms from birth and were diagnosed within 2 weeks of birth.  
Based on the more extensive surgical history for subject, subject appeared to have a more severe SMA 
phenotype. This could impact outcome measures. 
Number analysed 
The ITT population consisted of symptomatic patients with biallelic deletion mutations of SMN1 (exon 
7/8 common homozygous deletions) and 2 copies of SMN2 without the known gene modifier mutation 
(c.859G>C) who receive an IV infusion of AVXS-101 at less than 180 days of age.

Page 7/19 
 
 
 
 
The All Enrolled population and safety population consisted of all patients who received an IV infusion 
of AVXS-101. 
The All Enrolled, ITT, and Safety populations are equivalent and included 2 enrolled patients. 
CHMP comments 
All participants were analysed. 
Efficacy results 
Primary efficacy results 
Patient achieved the primary endpoint of ‘sitting without support’ at the age of 12.7 months (380 
days), which was outside of the normal developmental window (age ≤ 279 days); Patient did not 
achieve the primary endpoint during the study. 
CHMP comments 
One patient reached the primary endpoint and 1 did not. These numbers are too small to draw any 
meaningful conclusions. This result is in line with the results of study CL-302 in which 43.8% of the ITT 
population achieved the primary endpoint of sitting without support for at least 10 seconds at any visit 
up to and including the 18 month visit. 
During the pivotal study, 63.6% of participants achieved sitting without support for at least 10 
seconds. 
Secondary efficacy results 
Both patients survived event-free, defined as avoidance of either death or permanent ventilation, 
≥ 14 months of age; both patients survived event-free at 18 months of age.  
CHMP comments 
The result of event-free survival to ≥ 14 months of age is in line with the results of study CL-302 in 
which 96.9% of the ITT population achieved this endpoint. In addition, it is also in line with study CL-
303, in which 20 out of 22 enrolled patients (90.9%) survived event-free to both 14 and 18 months of 
age. 
Exploratory efficacy results 
Developmental milestones: 
• 
• 
Patient achieved the developmental milestone of ‘rolls from back to sides’ as defined by Bayley 
criteria. 
Patient  achieved  developmental  milestones  of  ‘head  control’,  ‘rolls  from  back  to  sides’,  ‘sits 
without support’ as defined by Bayley criteria; and ‘sitting without support’ (primary endpoint) 
as defined by WHO-MGRS criteria. 
Bayley scales of infant and toddler development fine and gross motor subtests: 
• 
Patient  showed  a  23-point  improvement  in  Fine  Motor  subtest  raw  score  from  3  points  at 
baseline  to  26  points  at  Age  18  Month  Visit.  The  patient’s  Gross  Motor  subtest  raw  score 
increased from 0 at baseline to 8 points at Age 18 Months Visit.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CAT/66683/2022  
Page 8/19 
 
 
 
• 
Patient  showed  a  32-point  improvement  in  Fine  Motor  subtest  raw  score  from  3  points  at 
baseline  to  35  points  at  Age  18  Month  Visit.  The  patient’s  Gross  Motor  subtest  raw  score 
increased from 4 points at baseline to 29 points at Age 18 Months Visit. 
CHOP INTEND: 
• 
• 
Patient showed a 31-point improvement in CHOP INTEND score from 20 total score at baseline 
to 51 total score at Age 18 Months Visit. 
Patient showed a 14-point improvement in CHOP INTEND score from 46 total score at baseline 
to 60 total score at Age 18 Months Visit 
Independence of ventilation support: 
• 
• 
Patient  received  non-invasive  ventilatory  support  (BiPAP)  starting  on  Day  61  and  ongoing  at 
the  last  study  visit.  The  reason  for  ventilatory  support  was  due  to  progression  of  disease 
without acute cause. Patient also received cough assist during Day 362 to Day 461 
Patient  achieved independence of ventilatory support at all timepoints through the study. 
Independence of nutritional support: 
• 
• 
Patient received feeding support of nasogastric tube from Day -6 to Day 465 and gastrostomy 
tube from Day 466 and ongoing at the last study visit. 
Patient did not require any feeding support during the study. 
Ability to thrive 
The ability to thrive was defined as the ability to tolerate thin liquids, not requiring nutrition through 
mechanical support, and maintaining weight consistent with age. Using this definition, no patients 
achieved the ability to thrive at any post-dose time points including the Age 18 Months Visit. 
CHMP comments 
First and foremost, the number of participants, 2, is too small to draw any firm conclusions. 
Both patients achieved motor milestone(s), confirmed by independent central video review. Both 
patients achieved “rolls from back to sides”, while only the participant who achieved the primary 
efficacy endpoint also achieved developmental milestones of ‘head control’, ‘sits without support’ as 
defined by Bayley criteria. In both studies CL-303 and CL-302 patients achieved motor milestones.  
Both participants showed an improvement in performance on both the Bayley Scales gross motor and 
fine motor subtests. This is in line with the previous studies CL-303 and CL-302. Absent gene 
replacement therapy, few untreated children with SMA type 1 would ever achieve a raw score greater 
than zero on the gross motor subtest. Both participants achieved higher raw scores on the gross motor 
subset: achieved a raw score of 8 at End of study Visit and subject achieved a score of 29. However, 
the scaled score, reflecting performance according to age as compared with other, normally-developing 
children of the same age, was 1 for both patients. As the mean score is 10, with SD of ± 3 points; this 
indicates that they fell outside the 2SD of normal development. 
Both patients achieved a CHOP-INTEND score ≥50 at age 18 months. Patients with untreated SMA 
Type 1 almost never achieve a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 40. Again, the results are in line with the both 
study CL-303 and CL-302, in which improvement of CHOP-INTEND scores were seen: with 63.6% of

patients achieving a CHOP-INTEND score of ≥50 during study CL-303 and 42.4% of patients during 
study CL-302.  
Of note, the CHOP-INTEND baseline score of 46 at baseline for patient is considered high, however, 
based on natural history the CHOP-INTEND score should decline over time as irreversible damage 
increases. Therefore, the increase in CHOP-INTEND score is still considered a clinical benefit of the 
treatment.  
Of the 2 patients in the current study, 1 did not require any form of ventilation support while the other 
receive BiPAP during the study. These results are in line with study CL-302, as 42.4% did not require 
ventilatory support and 57.6% used BiPAP, and study CL-303, as 15 of 22 patients (68.1%) did not 
require any non-invasive ventilatory support at any point during the study. 
Of the 2 patients in the current study, 1 did not require any feeding support while the other received 
feeding support by nasogastric tube and gastrostomy (with Nissen fundoplication). During study CL-
302 12 patients (36.4%) received feeding support. 
Both patients did not thrive. Subject received feeding support and did not maintain weight ≥3rd 
percentile. Subject was not able to maintain weight ≥3rd percentile. During study CL-303, 40.9% of 
patients were able to thrive, defined as the ability to tolerate thin liquids, to not receive nutrition 
through mechanical support, and to maintain weight consistent with age.  
Safety results 
The safety of IV administration of AVXS-101 in patients with SMA Type 1 has been assessed in the 
completed Study AVXS-101-CL-306. 
CHMP comments 
The  study  was  open-label  and  patients  received  a  single  infusion  intravenous.  The  patients  were 
followed up to an age of 18 months, indicating a relatively limited follow-up time.  
The  assessment  of  safety  in  this  study  is  limited,  as  only  2  patients  were  included  in  the  study.  In 
addition, the assessment of safety is hampered by the fact that the AE’s reported could also be related 
to SMA type 1 and it’s complications and, due to common childhood diseases or both.    
Patient exposure 
AVXS-101 was administered as an IV infusion under the supervision of the investigational site 
personnel. The treatment compliance - as determined by total volume administered/planned weight-
adjusted dose administered - was 100% for each patient, see Table 3.

CHMP comments 
Patients were treated with AVXS-101 according to posology recommended in the SmPC.   
Adverse Events 
All patients experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study, with an overall total of 30 TEAEs. An 
overview of TEAEs is provided in Table 4. None of the TEAEs, SAE, or AESI was considered related to 
AVXS-101 by the Investigator. 
Table 4 Overview of TEAEs (Safety population) 
CHMP comments 
Both  patients  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE.  In  total  30  TEAEs  were  observed.  Most  being  mild  to 
moderate in intensity, as only 1 ≥ grade 3 TEAE occurred during the study.  
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events 
A summary of TEAEs by SOC and PT is provided in Table 4. The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT 
were dysphagia, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection. 
None of the TEAEs were considered related to the treatment

Table 5 TEAEs overall by system organ class and preferred term (Safety 
population) 
CHMP comments 
Both  patients  were  reported  to  experience  any  adverse  event  (AE).  When  compared  at  the  MedDRA 
system organ class level, most AE’s were reported for the domain Gastrointestinal disorders, Infections 
and  Infestations,  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and  Mediastinal  Disorders  and  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue 
Disorders (see Table 5). This is comparable to the AEs observed in the studies submitted during MAA. 
Some  of  the  observed  AE’s  may  fit  with  the  normal  development  of  infants;  like  common  childhood 
infections (e.g. pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection), dermatitis diaper and rash. Others may 
also be disease related such as failure to thrive, respiratory events or dysphagia.   
In  subject,  the  first  reported  TEAE  (respiratory  distress)  occurred  14  days  after  treatment.  All  TEAEs 
were considered unrelated. Pyrexia occurred at the earliest 90 days after treatment for this patient. It

is agreed that this is considered unrelated. All TEAEs, except for 1 occurrence of dysphagia (grade 3), 
were mild (grade 1) in intensity. All TEAEs resolved, except for failure to thrive and dysphagia. 
In subject, the first reported TEAE (acute upper respiratory infection) occurred 9 days after treatment. 
All TEAEs were considered unrelated by the investigator. This can be agreed. However, the first TEAE  
of  acute  upper  respiratory  infection  could  potentially  be  related  to  prednisolone  treatment.  All  TEAEs 
were mild in intensity. Three TEAEs were considered unresolved at study termination: failure to thrive, 
submucosal cleft palate and dysphagia. 
Adverse Events of special interest 
Five categories of AESIs were assess in this study: hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, cardiac adverse 
events, thrombotic microangiopathy, and sensory abnormalities suggestive of ganglionopathy. 
No treatment-emergent AESIs were identified in hepatotoxicity, cardiac adverse events, thrombotic 
microangiopathy, and sensory abnormalities suggestive of ganglionopathy related SMQs. 
Patient experienced a thrombocytopenia-related AESI of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (Day 326 
to Day 448) by PT (Listing 16.2.7.8.2). The event was Grade 1 (mild) in severity; it was resolved and 
considered not related to the study treatment by the Investigator. The event of upper gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage was not associated with a low platelet value as the platelet counts for this patient were 
within the normal range of 189-459 × 109/L during this period. 
CHMP comments 
The  AE  of  upper  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  mapped  to  the  thrombocytopenia  category  and  was 
therefore considered an AESI. The narrative detailed the following: 
On 06-Jun-2019 (Day -1), the local laboratory value included platelet counts of 425 × 109/L (RR: 229-
597  ×109/L).  On  27-Apr-2020  (Day  326),  the  subject  developed  upper  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage 
(grade 1, no laboratory values reported). No treatment was reported. On 27-Aug-2020 (Day 448), the 
subject  recovered  from  upper  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage.  On  the  same  day,  the  local  laboratory 
value included platelet counts of 319 × 109/L (RR: 189-459 × 109/L). 
Based  on  the listings  of  clinical  haematology  values,  platelet  counts  were  within  normal  range during 
the period that the upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred. It is therefore agreed that this AESI 
does not indicate sign of thrombocytopenia and is not considered related to the treatment. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Patient experienced an SAE of dysphagia that led to a hospitalization. The event occurred on Day 462 
and was resolved on Day 470 without treatment. The SAE was considered not related to the study 
treatment by the Investigator. 
No patient died during the study. 
CHMP comments 
On  02-Dec-2019  (Day  179),  subject  developed  dysphagia  (grade  1,  non-serious),  which  worsened  to 
grade  3  on  10-Sep-2019  (Day  462).  The  patient  underwent  gastrostomy  and  laparoscopic  nissen 
fundoplication  surgery.  On  19-Sep-2019,  dysphagia  improved  to  grade  1.  It  is  agreed  that  the 
dysphagia is most likely caused by the underlying disease.

Laboratory Findings 
Haematology 
High levels of haemoglobin that were outside of normal range were observed in both patients. At Visit 
13 (Month 8), Patient (age 9.3 months) had a haemoglobin value of 157 g/L (normal range: 101-127 
g/L) that was flagged as PCS (> 155 g/L). 
CHMP comments 
Both  patients  showed  transient  increased  haemoglobin  and  haematocrit  values  at  numerous  times 
during  the  study,  however  they  were  more  consistently  seen  in  patient.  Patient  had  high  levels  of 
haemoglobin (above normal range of 101-127 g/L) starting Month 6, which returned to within normal 
range  after  Month  17  and  was  ≥155  g/L  only  at  Month  8.  Due  to  the  delayed  onset  (Month  6),  the 
abnormal  post-baseline  haemoglobin  levels  are  most  probably  related  to  the  underlying  disease 
(oxygenation and ventilation requirements).  
Patient  had  high  levels  of  leukocytes  (18.9  *109/L;  normal  range  6-14.99*109/L)  at  Month  4  (PCS; 
>17.5), which returned to normal level the following visit. 
Considering  the  fact  that  increases  were  transient  in  nature  and  seen  in  previous  studies,  these 
findings were not considered a new safety signal. 
Clinical chemistry 
Transient elevations in transaminase values were observed. No patients with a Grade 3 ALT, AST, 
alkaline phosphatase or total bilirubin were reported. No patients meeting the ALT ≥ 3× ULN and total 
bilirubin value ≥ 2× ULN criterion were reported. 
High levels of troponin were flagged for both patients:  
• 
• 
Patient had troponin values of 0.098 ug/L at screening, 0.114 μg/L at Day 7, and 0.121 μg/L at 
Day  30  that  were  outside  of  the  normal  range  (0-0.039  μg/L)  and  flagged  as  potentially 
clinically significant (PCS; > 0.05 μg/L).  
Patient    had  a  troponin  value  of  0.067  μg/L  (normal  range:  0-0.039  μg/L)  at  screening  that 
was flagged as PCS (> 0.05 μg/L). 
High level of bilirubin was also flagged for patient at screening; this patient had a bilirubin value of 
166.72 μmol/L (normal range: 5.13-17.1 μmol/L) that was marked as PCS (>33.4 μmol/L). This event 
was considered to be neonatal jaundice by the Investigator and documented in the medical history. 
CHMP comments 
Both  patients  had  increased  levels  of  alkaline  phosphatase  from  screening  (grade  1)  that  remained 
high throughout the study period. This increase is therefore not considered transient. As it was present 
at screening, it is not considered related to the treatment.  
Transient  increases  in  ALT  and  AST  were  observed  (all  not  over  grade  1)  for  patient.  Patient  did  not 
show  any  increases  in  ALT,  while  AST  was  increased  from  Month  7  until  end  of  the  study,  all 
measurements not over CTCAE grade 1. As the AST was ongoing at end of study it is not considered 
transient.  However,  similar  increases  in  AST  that  were  ongoing  at  study  end  were  observed  in  the 
pivotal study CL-303. This is not considered a new safety signal.

Levels  of  troponin-I  outside  protocol  criterion  (>  0.05  μg/L)  were  observed  for  both  patients  from 
screening up till Month 2. Of note, a study of 869 healthy infants defined the upper reference limit for 
cardiac troponin I in healthy term new-borns as 0.183 μg/L. None of the patients in Study CL-306 had 
cardiac troponin I levels exceeding this value. 
Transient increases and decreases in bilirubin and direct bilirubin were observed for patient. In patient, 
a  potentially  clinically  relevant  increase  in  bilirubin  was  observed  at  screening,  considered  related  to 
neonatal  jaundice,  which  is  agreed.  The  levels  of  bilirubin  and  direct  bilirubin,  decreased  to  normal 
values at Day 7 after treatment with AVXS-101. Transient decreases in bilirubin were seen throughout 
the study. 
The  only  potentially  clinically  relevant  findings,  outside  screening,  were  on  troponin  I,  which  
considering these findings were within the reference value of 0.183 µg/L, obtained from a study using 
869 infants, is not considered clinically relevant.  
None  of  the  laboratory  values  were  considered  an  AE  of  grade  3  of  higher.  None  of  the  patients had 
ALT ≥ 3x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN. The clinical chemistry did not reveal any new safety signals.  
Urinalysis 
No clinical meaningful findings in urinalysis were noted. 
CHMP comments 
For patient, an AE of glucose in urine was reported at Day 476. In the urinalysis listing at Day 476 a 
glucose  result  of  2000  (4+)  was  reported  (no  normal  range  presented),  where  it  was  negative 
previously. The AE is considered resolved at Day 478, however at end of study glucose measures 250 
(2+). The MAH is asked to present the corresponding unit for glucose for the test to determine whether 
the measurement of 250 is considered within normal range (OC). 
Discontinuations due to AEs 
No study discontinuation is reported. 
CHMP comments 
None of the participants discontinued.   
Immunological events  
Both  treated  patients  had  anti-AAV9  antibody  titres  of  ≤  1:50  at  screening  as  required  by  the  study 
protocol, and patients’ biological mothers also had anti-AAV9 antibody titres of ≤ 1:50 at screening. 
Both treated patients had a treatment-induced anti-AAV9 antibody response:  
• 
• 
Patient had anti-AAV9 antibody titres of <1:50 on Day 7, 1:800 on Day 14, 1:3200 on Day 21, 
and 1:6400 on Day 30. 
Patient had anti-AAV9 antibody titres of 1:1600 on Day 7 and 1:800 on Day 14, Day 21, and 
Day 30.  
All  patients had  an  anti-hSMN  titre of  <  1:12.5  at baseline.  No post-treatment  increases in  anti-SMN 
antibody titres were observed.

CHMP comments 
Anti-AAV9  titres  >  1:50  at  baseline  was  one  of  the  exclusion  criteria.  Both  patients  had  anti-AAV9 
antibody  titres  of  ≤  1:50;  patient  037-001  1:12.5  and  patient  037-002  ≤  1:12.5.  At  follow-up, 
increase in Anti-AAV9 titres was observed as expected after a pseudo-viral infection.  
No  immunological  response  was  observed  for  hSMN.  This  is  expected  since  SMN1  is  an  endogenous 
protein also present in SMA although in insufficient amounts.    
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
For  this  Article  46  procedure,  the  MAH  submitted  the  final  report  for  study  AVXS-101-CL-306,  which 
was a phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose gene replacement therapy study to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of a single IV infusion of AVXS-101 (also known as OAV101) in patients with SMA 
Type 1 with 1 or 2 copies of the SMN2 gene. 
Design of the study 
The design of the study was identical to study AVXS-101-CL-302, which was designed as the European 
counterpart  for  study  AVXS-101-CL-303  (the  pivotal  study  included  in  the  MAA  submission).  Patients 
received a single dose of AVXS-101 at a dose of 1.1 x 1014 vg/kg, which is identical to the posology 
recommended  in  the  SmPC.  The  SmPC  recommends  the  use  of  1  mg/kg/day  prednisolone  from 
24 hours  prior  to  AVXS-101  treatment  to  30  days  post  infusion,  however,  during  the  current  study  a 
dose  of  2  mg/kg/day  was  used.  The  investigation  of  a  higher  dose  of  prednisolone  pre-treatment  (2 
mg/kg/day for the first 3 days) has been agreed during the MAA procedure.  
The  scope  of  the  study  changed,  as  the  results  of  the  current  study  were  supposed  to  be  combined 
with  the  results  of  study  AVXS-101-CL-302  which,  over  the  course  of  the  study,  was  not  considered 
relevant  anymore  due  to  sufficient  evidence  of  efficacy  in  study  AVXS-1014-CL-302  alone.  The  study 
changed to an exploratory study.  
Sample size is extremely limited with 2 participants. The sample size precludes any conclusions being 
drawn from this study. Only descriptive analyses were performed. 
Both participants were symptomatic at baseline, had bi-allelic deletion of the SMN1 gene and 2 copies 
of the SMN2 gene. Both displayed symptoms from birth and were diagnosed within 2 weeks of birth (at 
day  8  and  at  day  11).  Based  on  the  more  extensive  surgical history  for  subject,  subject  appeared  to 
have a more severe SMA phenotype, which could potentially impact outcome measures. 
Efficacy results 
As stated previously, due to the limited sample size (n=2) no firm conclusions can be drawn based on 
this study.  
Patient achieved the both primary and secondary endpoints, while patient only achieved the secondary 
endpoint of event-free survival. Compared to patient, patient overall developed better achieving more 
motor  milestones,  higher  improvement  on  Bayley  Scales  gross  motor  and  fine  motor  subtests  and 
higher CHOP-INTEND scores. Patient did not require any type of ventilation or feeding support, while 
patient  required  BiPAP  and  feeding  support.  This  might  be  due  to  the  fact  that  patient  appeared  to 
have a less severe phenotype at baseline.  
Overall,  treatment  benefit  was  shown  by  the  fact  that  both  patients  achieved  event-free  survival  at 
both 14 months and 18 months of age. In addition, both patients achieved a CHOP-INTEND score ≥50

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

at age 18 months. Patients with untreated SMA Type 1 almost never achieve a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 
40. 
However,  both  patients  showed  a  failure  to  thrive.  Subject  received  feeding  support  and  did  not 
maintain weight ≥3rd percentile. Subject was not able to maintain weight ≥3rd percentile. In addition, 
the  scaled  Bayley  score,  reflecting  performance  according  to  age  as  compared  with  other,  normally 
developing children of the same age, was 1 for both patients. As the mean score is 10, with SD of ± 3 
points; this indicates that both patients fell outside the 2SD of normal development.  
Overall,  the  efficacy  results  of  study  AVXS-101-CL-306  were  in  line  with  the  results  of  study  AVXS-
101-CL-302. 
Safety 
The  assessment  of  safety  in  this  study  is  limited,  as  only  2  patients  were  included  in  the  study  and 
patients were followed up to an age of 18 months reflecting a limited follow-up time. In addition, the 
assessment  of  safety  is  hampered  by  the  single-arm  design  which  makes  it  difficult  to  disentangle 
whether an AE is due to treatment with AVXS-101 and accompanied corticosteroid use, due to SMA1 or 
its complications or due to natural occurring background childhood diseases.    
The safety profile observed in study AVXS-101-CL-306 is comparable to the safety profile presented in 
the submitted data for the original MAA.  
Both  patients  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE.  Of  the  30  TEAEs  observed,  most  were  considered  mild  to 
moderate  in  intensity  and  were  reported  for  the  domain  Gastrointestinal  disorders,  Infections  and 
Infestations,  Respiratory,  Thoracic  and  Mediastinal  Disorders  and  Skin  and  Subcutaneous  Tissue 
Disorders.  All  AE’s  were  considered  unrelated  to  the  treatment  by  the  investigator,  which  can  be 
agreed.  However,  the  first  TEAE  reported  in  patient,    of  acute  upper  respiratory  infection  could 
potentially be related to prednisolone treatment. 
One patient experienced upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, recorded as an AESI, as it mapped to the 
thrombocytopenia  category.  The  AE  was  mild  in  severity  and  resolved.  This  AESI  was  not  considered 
related  to  the  treatment,  as  according  to  the  haematology  listings  platelet  values  at  the  time  of  the 
bleeding event were normal. No treatment-emergent AESIs were identified in other AESI categories. 
One  SAE  of  grade  3  dysphagia  occurred  during  the  study.  This  SAE  was  considered  unrelated  to 
treatment, and more likely caused by the underlying disease. None of the patients died or discontinued 
study treatment. 
The clinical chemistry did not reveal any new safety signals. One transient event of glucosuria occurred 
in one patient which is likely unrelated to the study drug given the late onset on day 476.  
Overall, AVXS-101 was shown to be relatively safe. No new safety signals were identified. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The efficacy and safety results of study AVXS-101-CL-306 were in line with the results obtained during 
the identically designed study AVXS-101-CL-302. As only 2 patients were included in the currently 
submitted study and no new safety signals were observed, it is agreed that the SmPC does not need to 
be updated with this information.

5.  Assessment  of  the  MAH  responses  to  Request  for 
supplementary information 
Question 1 
The MAH is asked to present the corresponding unit for glucose for the test to determine whether the 
measurement of 250 (+2) at end of study for patient is considered within normal range. 
Novartis response 
The  MAH  would  like  to  confirm  that  the  corresponding  unit  for  the  urine  test  strip  (dipstick)  results 
refer  to  glucose  concentration  in  mg/dL.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  would  like  to  highlight  that  the  test 
methodology  (dipstick)  used  is  based  on  a  threshold  analysis  with  detection  threshold  concentration 
corresponding  to  >  100  mg/dL  (1+).  In  line  with  this,  any  report  of  glucosuria  (i.e.  a  detectable 
concentration of glucose in urine by a clinical test including urine dipstick) is considered abnormal. As 
summarized in CL-306 Clinical Study Report [Listing 16.2.7.1], patient had a nonserious adverse event 
(AE) of urine glucose increase reported on study Day 476 which had resolved on Day 478. In addition, 
another non-serious AE of glucosuria was reported on study day 511 with the event ongoing at the end 
of the study. Both the events were mild, considered unrelated to the study treatment by investigator 
with no treatment administered for any of the events.   
Assessment of the response 
The applicant has clarified that a positive dipstick measurement per definition is abnormal. Given the 
transient nature of the glucosuria, which could be caused by several different factors including a high 
carbohydrate meal, the event does not raise a safety concern. In addition, the occurrence of the event 
476 days after dosing indicates that it is not likely to be related to the study drug.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for exenatide, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
Thirtytwo  cases  of  pancreatitis  have  been  reported  cumulatively  with  once  weekly-treated  patients. 
25/32  cases  were  reported  during  the  period  of  review  for  this  PSUR,  of  which  positive  de-challenge 
was  reported  in  13  of  the  cases.  Therefore  as  data  is  now  available  for  patients  treated  with  once-
weekly exenatide (Bydureon), section 4.8 of the SmPC of Bydureon  should be updated  to add “acute 
pancreatitis”  under  the  SOC  Gastrointestinal  disorders  with  a  frequency  “not  known”  (as  post-
marketing  experience  for  Bydureon,  table  1,  while  removing  “acute  pancreatitis”  as  reflecting 
experience from Byetta only, table 2). The Package leaflet should be updated accordingly.   
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Bydureon the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance exenatide is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information of Bydureon. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation of Bydureon should be varied.

2. Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  is  a  disease  affecting  more  than  180 million  people  worldwide  and 
particularly in the industrialised countries the incidence of this disorder is increasing. The prevalence is 
expected to rise to 300 million people by the year 2025. T2DM is characterised by multiple metabolic 
Jentadueto 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 6/134
 
 
 
 
abnormalities involving insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased glucose production. 
Morbidity  and  mortality  associated  with  T2DM  is  caused  by  macrovascular  complications  such  as 
cardiovascular  disease  and  microvascular  complications  such  as  retinopathy,  neuropathy,  and 
nephropathy.  In  addition  to  diet  and  exercise,  a  number  of  medications  are  available  to  lower  blood 
sugar levels. However, all of the established therapies have limitations including a range of safety and 
tolerability  issues,  limited  extent  and/or  durability of  efficacy,  and  inconvenience  in  dosing.  The  most 
common adverse events associated with currently used agents are hypoglycaemia (with sulfonylureas, 
meglitinides, insulin), weight gain (with sulfonylureas, meglitinides, insulin, thiazolidinediones [TZDs]), 
and gastrointestinal intolerance (with metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors). Dipeptidyl-dipeptidase-
4  (DPP-4)  inhibitors  are  generally  well  tolerated;  treatment  with  the  currently  marketed  DPP-4 
inhibitors  (sitagliptin,  saxagliptin,  vildagliptin)  was  however  associated  with  elevated  incidences  of 
infections  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (compared  with  placebo).  Sitagliptin,  vildagliptin,  and 
saxagliptin  are  either  not  indicated  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  renal  impairment  or  require 
dose adjustments in this patient population.  
About the product 
Jentadueto is a fixed dose combination of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. 
Linagliptin  (BI  1356)  is  a  selective,  orally  administered,  xanthine-based  inhibitor  of  dipepti-
dylpeptidase-4  (DPP-4)  with  a  50%  Inhibitor  Concentration  (IC50)  of  1  nM.  DPP-4  inhibitors  are 
antidiabetic agents that lower blood glucose by extending the short half life of glucagon-like peptide 1 
(GLP-1),  which  is  secreted  by  intestinal  L-cells  in  response  to  a  meal,  and  glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic peptide (GIP), both of which exert glucose-dependent insulinotropic effects and thereby 
contribute  to  the  maintenance  of  post-meal  glycaemic  control.  GLP-1  lowers  blood  glucose  by 
increasing  the  glucose-stimulated  insulin  release  and  by  limiting  glucagon  secretion  to  slow  gastric 
emptying  and  to  induce  satiety.  DPP-4  inhibitors  maintain  long-term  β-cell  function,  which  has  been 
demonstrated in animal models. Inhibition of DPP-4 bears little risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with 
diabetes  mellitus  because  GLP-1  activity  ceases  when  plasma  glucose  concentration  falls  below 
55 mg/dl.  Linagliptin  is  predominantly  excreted  unchanged  via  the  faeces.  Renal  excretion  is  a  minor 
pathway  of  elimination  of  linagliptin  at  therapeutic  doses.  A  Marketing  Authorisation  for  linagliptin 
(Trajenta 5mg) was granted in the EU by the EC on the 24th of August 2011.

Metformin  has  been  used  in  Europe  for  over  50  years  and,  together  with  lifestyle  modification,  is 
recommended by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) as the first-line treatment 
for T2DM. The immediate release dosage forms are widely approved with tablet strengths of 500 mg, 
850 mg and 1000 mg approved in several countries. Although its mechanism of action is not yet fully 
understood,  metformin lowers  blood  glucose levels  primarily  by  suppressing  hepatic  gluconeogenesis. 
It is believed that this is achieved through metformin-induced activation of adenosine monophosphate-
activated protein kinase, an energy-regulating enzyme in the liver. Furthermore, metformin improves 
the  insulin  sensitivity  of  peripheral  tissues,  decreases  gastrointestinal  tract  glucose  absorption,  and 
acts  as  an  insulin  sensitiser  without  exerting  any  direct  effect  on  pancreatic  β-cell  insulin  secretion. 
Through these mechanisms, metformin therapy typically leads to substantial reductions in glycosylated 
HbA 1c but it does not promote weight gain or increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
The combination of linagliptin with metformin may provide clinically meaningful treatment benefits by 
lowering glucose and reducing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) further than monotherapy with either 
component  at  corresponding  doses.  Combining  linagliptin  with  metformin  hydrochloride  simplifies  the 
antidiabetic  therapy  by  decreasing  the  number  of  tablets  to  be  taken  and  is  expected  to  improve 
patients’  compliance  with  medication;  fixed-dose  combination  therapy  has  resulted  in  improved 
compliance in patients previously treated with oral antidiabetics. 
The Applicant applied for the following strengths: 2.5 mg/500 mg, 2.5 mg/850 mg, and 2.5 mg/ 1000 
mg. The recommended starting dose of Jentadueto for patients not adequately controlled on metformin 
alone  is  2.5  mg  of  linagliptin  twice  daily  (5  mg  daily  dose)  plus  the  dose  of  metformin  already  being 
taken. For patients switching from co-administration of linagliptin and metformin, Jentadueto should be 
initiated at the dose of linagliptin and metformin already being taken. The applicant therefore proposed 
to recommend a starting dose of Jentadueto for patients inadequately controlled on dual combination 
therapy  with  the  maximal  tolerated  dose  of  metformin  and  a  sulphonylurea  is  2.5  mg  of  linagliptin 
twice  daily  (5  mg  total  daily  dose)  and  a  dose  of  metformin  similar  to  the  dose  already  being  taken. 
When  linagliptin  plus  metformin  is  used  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea,  a  lower  dose  of  the 
sulphonylurea may be required due to the risk of hypoglycaemia. For the different doses of metformin, 
Jentadueto  is  available  in  strengths  of  2.5 mg  linagliptin  plus  850 mg  metformin  hydrochloride  and 
2.5 mg linagliptin plus 1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The clinical development program of linaglipin/metformin was designed to demonstrate the safety and 
efficacy  of  linagliptin  as  monotherapy,  metformin  as  monotherapy  and  linagliptin  and  metformin  as 
FDC  in  patients  with  T2DM.  The  program  included  24  phase  I  studies,  4  phase  II  and  9  phase  III 
studies for linagliptin as monotherapy, 6 phase I, 2 phase II and 4 phase III studies for the FDC. No 
dedicated studies with metformin as monotherapy were conducted. The pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
efficacy profiles of metformin as monotherapy are well known and well established in the literature. 
The  development  programme  of  linagliptin/metformin  complies  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  “Note  for 
guidance  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  for  the  treatment  of  diabetes  mellitus 
(CPMP/EWP/1080/00)”. This guideline is currently under revision.  
Scientific advice was provided by the CHMP in September 2008 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/ 472394/2008) on 
the non-clinical and clinical aspects of the development program. The CHMP requested a clinical study 
to  show  equivalence  of  twice  daily  dosing  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg  with  once  daily  dosing  of  linagliptin  5 
mg.  This  study  was  subsequently  conducted  by  the  Applicant  and  its  results  are  presented  in  this 
Marketing Authorisation application.  
A product-specific waiver (P/3/2010) has been agreed for linagliptin/metformin by the PDCO.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1. Introduction 
Jentadueto  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  two  active  substances  linagliptin  and 
metformin  hydrochloride.  Two  strengths  of  the  product  with  the  same  amount  of  linagliptin  (2.5 mg) 
but with different amounts of metformin hydrochloride (850 mg or 1000 mg) were developed. 
The  tablets  are  oval  and  biconvex.  The  2.5 mg/850 mg  tablets  are  light  orange,  debossed  with 
"D2/850" on one side and the company logo on the other. The 2.5 mg/1000 mg tablets are light pink, 
debossed with "D2/1000" on one side and the company logo on the other. 
Excipients  used  in  the  formulation  of  Jentadueto  are  well  known  excipients  commonly  used  in  tablet 
formulations, such as arginine, copovidone, magnesium stearate, maize starch and colloidal anhydrous 
silica.  These  excipients  are  used  to  manufacture  the  tablet  cores  which  are  then  coated  with  film 
coating  consisting  of  hypromellose,  titanium  dioxide  (E171),  talc,  propylene  glycol  and  iron  oxides, 
yellow and red (E172) (coating for the 2.5 mg/850 mg strength) or iron oxide, red (E172) (coating for 
the 2.5 mg/1000 mg strength). 
The tablets are packed either in perforated unit dose blisters consisting of an aluminium lidding foil and 
a  PVC/polychlorotrifluoro  ethylene/PVC  based  forming  foil  (alu/PVC/PCTFE/PVC  blisters),  or  in  high-
density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with plastic screw caps. 
Initially the applicant applied for 3 strengths of the product 2.5 mg/500 mg, 2.5 mg/850 mg, and 2.5 
mg/1000 mg, all to be taken twice daily (bid). However during the evaluation the lowest strength (2.5 
mg/500 mg) was withdrawn.  
2.2.2. Active Substance 
Linagliptin 
Linagliptin  is  chemically  designated  as  8-[(3R)-3-aminopiperidin-1-yl]-7-(but-2-yn-1-yl)-3-methyl-1-
[(4-methylquinazolin-2-yl)methyl]-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione and has the following structure: 
It is a white to yellowish crystalline solid substance, slightly hygroscopic. It is very soluble in aqueous 
media (> 1 mg/ml) over the entire physiological pH range. It is soluble in methanol, sparingly soluble 
in  ethanol  and  very  slightly  soluble  in  isopropanol  and  acetone.  Linagliptin  is  classified  as  class  III 
compound  according  to  the  Biopharmaceutics  Classification  System  (BCS)  due  to  its  incomplete  oral 
systemic bioavailability and the moderate permeability observed in Caco-2 cells. 
Linagliptin  has  one  chiral  centre  at  the  3-aminopiperidine  moiety.  The  substance  used  for  the 
manufacture of Jentadueto tablets is the (R) enantiomer. 
Jentadueto 
CHMP assessment report

Linagliptin  simultaneously  exists  in  two  polymorphic  forms  The  two  polymorphic  forms  do  not  differ 
with  regard  to  relevant  physicochemical  properties  and  therefore  the  solid-state  differences  are 
unlikely to have any impact on bioavailability. 
The  chemical  structure  of  linagliptin  has  been  confirmed  by  means  of  UV,  IR,  1H-  and  13C-NMR 
spectroscopy and mass spectrometry  (MS). The content of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen have been 
determined  by  elemental  analysis.  The  absolute  configuration  of  the  active  substance  at  the  chiral 
carbon has been determined by means of X-ray crystallography. The solid state properties of linagliptin 
were  characterised  using  light  microscopy,  thermal  analysis  (TG  and  DSC)  and  X-ray  powder 
diffraction. 
Manufacture 
The synthetic process for linagliptin consists of three steps during which simple commercially available 
molecules are used as starting materials. The synthesis is followed by milling process. 
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail including suitable reaction schemes. 
The amounts of raw materials, yields, and equipment have been specified, and the in-process controls 
have  been  well  described.  Appropriate  specifications  for  starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been 
established.  
Potential impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. The levels of the 
impurities  with  an  acceptance  criterion  higher  than  max.0.15%  were  supported  by  the  results  of 
toxicological studies and appropriate specification limits have been set.  
The  synthetic  process  does  not  involve  Class  1  solvents  or  metal  catalysts.  The  Class  2  solvents  and 
the  Class  3  solvents  used  in  the  synthesis  have  been  shown  to  be  efficiently  removed  during  the 
process  and  appropriate  specifications  have  been  set  in  accordance  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on 
Impurities: Residual Solvents. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specifications  include  tests  with  suitable  limits  for  appearance  (visually), 
identification (IR, HPLC and melting point), impurities (GC, HPLC, Chiral-HPLC), residual solvents (GC), 
water content (KF), sulphated ash (weighing), particle size (laser-beam diffraction) and assay (HPLC).  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  sufficiently  described  and  validated  in  accordance  with  the 
Note for Guidance on Validation of Analytical Methods.  
Batch analysis results have been provided for 14 commercial scale batches manufactured according to 
the  proposed  synthetic  process.  All  results  were  consistent  from  batch  to  batch  and  demonstrated 
compliance with the proposed active substance specifications. 
Stability 
Stability studies have been performed in accordance with ICH requirements on three commercial scale 
batches  manufactured  by  the  proposed  route  of  synthesis.  The  samples  were  stored  for  up  to  36 
months  under  the  conditions  for  long  term  storage  (25°C/60% RH)  and  up  to  6  months  under 
accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH). The stability results presented were satisfactory and supported 
the proposed retest period.

In addition, one batch was subjected to forced degradation studies at elevated temperature, humidity, 
pH,  oxidative  conditions  and  light  in  the  solid  state  and  in  solution.  Photostability  testing  of  the  solid 
active substance was also performed according to ICH guideline Q1B. The results of the stress studies 
demonstrated  that  in  solid  form,  the  active  substance  is  very  stable  at  elevated  temperatures,  high 
humidity and the combined effect of both conditions. During photostability testing, only a slight change 
in  colour  was  observed,  but  no  change  in  impurity  profile  leading  to  the  conclusion  that  the  active 
substance is not sensitive to light. 
Metformin hydrochloride 
Metformin  hydrochloride  is  chemically  designated  as  1,1-dimethylbiguanide  monohydrochloride 
according to the IUPAC nomenclature and has the following structure: 
This active substance is described in the Ph. Eur. 
It  is  a  white  or  almost  white  crystalline  powder.  The  substance  is  freely  soluble  in  water,  slightly 
soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in acetone and methylene chloride. Metformin hydrochloride 
is classified as BCS class III compound. 
The chemistry, manufacturing and control information on metformin hydrochloride has been evaluated 
by  the  EDQM  and  a  European  Certificate  of  Suitability  of  the  Monograph  of  the  European 
Pharmacopoeia  (CEP)  has  been  issued.  A  copy  of  the  CEP  has  been  provided.  The  CEP  includes  an 
additional test for a residual solvent used during the last step of synthesis. The retest period and type 
of the container for storing the substance are also included in the certificate. In addition holder of the 
certificate has declared the absence of use of material of human or animal origin in the manufacturing 
process of the metformin hydrochloride. 
Batch  analysis  data  of  the  five  commercial  scale  batches  of  metformin  hydrochloride  were  provided. 
The  results  were  within  the  specification  limits,  consistent  from  batch  to  batch  and  demonstrated 
compliance with the Ph. Eur. monograph for this substance. 
2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The objective of the product development was to obtain an immediate release solid oral dosage form. 
A  twice-a-day  dosing  regimen  was  chosen  due  to  the  pharmacokinetics  of  metformin  hydrochloride. 
The  therapeutic  dose  of linagliptin  of 5  mg  once  a  day  was  divided  into  two  doses  of  2.5  mg  each  in 
order to match this dosing regimen. 
Initial  compatibility  studies  with  the  active  substances  showed  degradation  of  linagliptin  when 
combined with metformin hydrochloride. Several concepts to overcome this instability were considered 
for  the  final  formulation,  including  physical  separation  in  the  pharmaceutical  form  (bilayer  tablets)  or 
addition of a stabilizer. Screening trials with excipients with a potentially stabilising effect on linagliptin 
were  performed  in  order  to  find  a  suitable  stabilizer  for  the  formulation.  The  selection  of  excipients 
including their corresponding levels in the finished product is based on formulation experiments where 
Jentadueto 
CHMP assessment report

the  resulting  tablets  were  assessed  with  regard  to  mechanical  tablet  properties,  dissolution,  assay, 
content uniformity, chemical and physical stability as well as in vivo bioavailability studies. 
The  manufacturing  process  is  based  on  a  granulation  process.  Glidant  and  lubricant  are  added  in  a 
blending  step  followed  by  tablet  compression.  The  tablet  cores  are  than  film-coated.  During 
development of the product the blending time and the tablet compression process were optimised. 
The proposed commercial formulation was used practically unchanged from the very beginning of the 
development.  Only  a  minor  adjustment  was  made  in  the  pigments  in  the  film  coat  to  meet  the 
requested  colours  prior  to  the  manufacture  of  the  primary  stability  batches,  which  also  served  as 
supplies for the three pivotal clinical bioequivalence trials. Pivotal clinical studies were performed with 
combinations of tablets containing linagliptin (2.5 mg and 5 mg) and metformin hydrochloride tablets 
(500  mg  and  1000  mg).  The  applicant  performed  bioequivalence  studies  to  compare  the  mono  dose 
products  to  the  proposed  fixed  dose  combination  products  for  all  three  strengths.  The  test  products 
were full scale batches manufactured at the intended commercial manufacturing site. In parallel to the 
bioequivalence  studies,  in  vitro  dissolution  of  the  test  and  reference  products  was  compared  at  three 
pH.  The  dissolution  profiles  were  similar  with  regard  to  linagliptin  and  dissimilar  with  regard  to 
metformin hydrochloride. As bioequivalence was shown in vivo, this prevailed over the in vitro findings. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used for Jentadueto are of animal or human origin. 
Magnesium stearate used is of vegetable origin, arginine is manufactured by fermentation methods. 
Manufacture of the product 
Jentadueto film-coated tablets are manufactured using conventional process consisting of granulation, 
tablet  compression  and  coating.  Operating  parameters  and  in-process  controls  were  studied  to 
evaluate  their  effects  on  the  final  drug  product  properties.  Based  on  this  analysis,  critical  steps  were 
identified and IPC acceptance criteria were defined. 
Due to the low content of linagliptin per unit dose and in accordance with the NfG on Process Validation, 
manufacture of this product was regarded as a non standard process for which validation data on full-
scale batches are needed. No formal process validation data have been provided by the applicant and 
only  a  process  evaluation  report  for  all  strengths  of  the  finished  product.  The  data  presented  in  the 
process evaluation report were obtained from process evaluation trials at full production scale based on 
the  intended  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  the  tablets.  The  results  indicated  that  the 
manufacturing  process  was  reproducible  and  provides  product  that  complies  with  the  in-process  and 
finished product specifications. 
In  addition  the  applicant  confirmed  that  formal  process  validation  will  be  performed  on  three 
consecutive  commercial  scale  batches  per  tablet  strength  prior  to  marketing  of  the  product  and 
provided the validation protocol. This was accepted by the Committee.

Product specification 
The product specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification of both active substances 
and  arginine  (HPLC),  loss  on  drying  (weighing),  dissolution  (HPLC/UV),  uniformity  of  dosage  units: 
content  uniformity  of  linagliptin  (HPLC)  and  mass  variation  of  metformin  hydrochloride  (weighing), 
assay (HPLC) and degradation products (HPLC). 
The  analytical  methods  used  for  testing  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated  in  accordance 
with ICH guidelines. 
Batch  analysis  data  have  been  provided  on  nine  commercial  scale  batches  from  the  proposed 
commercial  manufacturing  site,  demonstrating  compliance  with  the  proposed  release  specification.  In 
addition,  batch  analysis  data  from  two  smaller  batches  produced  at  the  development  site  were 
provided. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  three  batches  of  each  strength  2.5  mg/500  mg  and  2.5  mg/1000  mg  film-coated 
tablets  and  one  batch  of  2.5  mg/850  mg  film-coated  tablets  were  submitted  in  support  of  the 
application.  The  batches  were  packaged  in  both  proposed  commercial  container/closure  system.  The 
stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  according  to  ICH  requirements.  A  bracketing  approach  was 
applied to different dosage strengths and bottle sizes. 
No significant changes were observed during the primary stability studies. Statistical evaluation of the 
assays  of  linagliptin,  metformin  hydrochloride,  and  arginine  supported  the  proposed  shelf-life  in  both 
container closure systems. 
In  addition  to  the  primary  stability  studies,  the  tablets  were  subjected  to  stress  stability  testing 
investigating the effects of elevated temperature, humidity, and light. The finished product was stable 
with  respect  to  elevated  temperature  and  light  and  susceptible  to  humidity.  The  proposed  storage 
conditions for the blisters and bottles with regard to protection from moisture are therefore justified. 
In-use  stability  studies  were  also  performed  for  the  product  packed  in  bottles.  The  largest  bottle 
contains 180 tablets. Based on a twice daily dosage regimen, this bottle will be kept for 90 days. The 
in-use  stability  studies  were  performed  with  two  primary  stability  batches  of  each  strength  stored  at 
long term conditions for nine and twenty four months prior to the study. No significant changes were 
observed. Loss on drying increased during storage but remained well within the shelf-life limit. On the 
basis  of  the  provided  in-use  stability  data,  no  temperature  storage  condition  is  necessary  for  the 
bottles after opening. 
On the basis of the provided stability data, the assigned shelf life and storage conditions as defined in 
the SmPC is well supported.  
2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  quality  of  Jentadueto  has  been  adequately  established.  In  general,  satisfactory  chemical  and 
pharmaceutical  documentation  has  been  submitted  in  support  of  the  marketing  authorisation 
application. 
The  active  substances  are  well  characterised  and  documented.  Although  linagliptin  simultaneously 
exists in two polymorphic forms, this does not have an impact on relevant physicochemical properties. 
The  quality  of  metformin  hydrochloride  is  assured  by  a  European  Certificate  of  Suitability  of  the 
Monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP).

The  excipients  are  commonly  used  in  these  types  of  formulations  and  comply  with  Ph.  Eur. 
requirements.  The  packaging  material  is  commonly  used  and  well  documented.  The  manufacturing 
process  of  the  finished  product  is  a  standard  process  that  has  been  adequately  described.  Stability 
tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the  proposed 
shelf life. 
2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory manner. There 
are  no  unresolved  quality  issues,  which  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Benefit  Risk  balance  of  the 
product. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1. Introduction 
A  comprehensive  non-clinical  development  was  conducted  to  support  the  chronic  use  of  linagliptin  in 
humans. Metformin is considered a well known active substance indicated for treatment of T2DM, with 
an established non-clinical and clinical safety profile. There is a limited amount of non-clinical data on 
metformin,  and  no  new  original  data  was  submitted.  The  applicant  performed  an  extensive  review  of 
the  literature.  In  the  light  of  the  longstanding  clinical  use  of  metformin,  this  was  considered  to  be 
acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  Non-clinical  studies  conducted  with  the  combination  of  linagliptin  and 
metformin were limited to repeat-dose toxicity studies and reproduction toxicity studies in line with the 
Guideline  on 
the  non-clinical  development  of 
fixed  combinations  of  medicinal  products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Pivotal studies regarding linagliptin and the combination of linagliptin and metformin were performed in 
compliance  with  GLP.  Metformin  is  a  well-established  substance.  It  is  not  known  whether  published 
studies with metformin were performed in compliance with GLP. 
2.3.2. Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Linagliptin 
In  vitro,  linagliptin  potently  and  selectively  inhibited  DPP-4  activity,  whereas  its  main  metabolite, 
CD1790, was pharmacologically inactive. 
In  both  normal  and  diabetic  mice  and  rats,  the  results  of  the  PD  studies  showed  that  oral 
administration of linagliptin significantly inhibits plasma DPP-4 activity accompanied by improvements 
in  glucose  homeostasis  and  glucose  tolerance.  In  diabetic  rats,  linagliptin  also  significantly  increased 
glucose-induced  elevations  of  GLP-1  and  insulin.  Although  efficacious  in  diabetic  animals,  the 
magnitude  of  decreasing  blood  glucose  is  dependent  on  the  severity  of  insulin  resistance  in  these 
animals. In Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats, linagliptin reduced less significantly blood glucose levels than in 
normal animals.  
Jentadueto 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 14/134
 
 
 
 
In Rhesus monkeys and Beagle dogs, linagliptin inhibited DPP-4 activity by >70% within 30 min which 
was  maintained  for  at  least  7  hours.  However,  no  blood  glucose  levels  were  measured  to  strengthen 
these  results.  The  IC50  values  of  0.23  nM  for  cynomolgus  DPP4  and  0.20  nM  for  the  human  DPP-4 
show  that  potency  is  comparable  in  both  species.  This  demonstrates  the  suitability  of  cynomolgus 
monkeys as animal model. 
Long duration of action in terms of both inhibition of DPP-4 and glycaemic control was, demonstrated 
in  mice  and  rats  orally  dosed  with  linagliptin.  The  results  of  these  studies  suggest  that  a  once  daily 
dosing  frequency  is  adequate  to  maintain  an  appropriate  degree  of  DPP-4  inhibition  that  exerts 
therapeutic effects on glucose.  
Long-term  treatment  of  diabetic  mice  reduced  fed  plasma  glucose  HbA1c  after  14  and  28  days.  This 
improved hyperglycaemia could not be explained by improved insulin sensitivity by linagliptin.  
Metformin 
Metformin  belongs  structurally  to  the  biguanides  and  is  an  insulin  sensitizing  drug,  which  improves 
fasted and postprandial plasma glucose in patients with T2DM. The mechanism of action of metformin 
is  still  not  fully  elucidated.  However  its  anti-diabetic  action  is  based  on  decreased  hepatic  glucose 
production  via  suppressed  gluconeogenesis,  decreased  absorption  of  glucose  from  the  intestine  and 
improved  insulin  sensitivity.  In  addition,  metformin  was  shown  to  increase  GLP-1  release  in  obese 
patients with or without type 2 diabetes. 
The pharmacological action of metformin has minor or no effect on insulin secretion, but reduces the 
demand  of  insulin  due  to  its  insulin  sensitizing  effect  by  increasing  peripheral  uptake  of  glucose.  The 
pharmacological  actions  of  metformin  are,  therefore,  targeted  towards  the  liver,  the  muscle  and  the 
adipose tissue. Further, metformin is not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
The  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  the  combination  of  linagliptin  and  metformin  were  studied  in  vitro. 
This study, which was not performed with the fixed-dose combination product, was conducted in order 
to  evaluate  additive  or  synergistic  effects  of  the  free  combination  of  linagliptin  and  metformin.  Male 
db/db  mice  were  orally  dosed  once  daily  for  one  week  with  either  vehicle,  linagliptin  (1  mg/kg), 
metformin (200 mg/kg), or a combination of linagliptin (1 mg/kg) and metformin (200 mg/kg). An oral 
glucose  tolerance  test  (oGTT)  was  performed  16  h  after  the  last  compound  administration.  The 
baseline  values  for  fasting  glucose  before  the  glucose  challenge  were  lower  in  all  treatment  groups 
than in the control group (-25% with linagliptin; -40% with metformin; - 44% with the combination). 
To  assess  the  effect  of  the  different  treatments  on  glucose  excursion,  the  baseline  value  was 
subtracted from all glucose measurements and an AUC was calculated. The AUC for glucose excursion 
was  reduced  by  13%  with  linagliptin  and  by  19%  with  metformin.  The  combined  treatment  of 
linagliptin and metformin resulted in a significant reduction of the AUC for glucose excursion by 37%.  
No  additional  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  submitted  for  the  fixed  dose  combination 
linagliptin/metformin which was considered acceptable.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Linagliptin 
Secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  (non-GLP)  were  performed  to 
investigate  neurological, 
cardiovascular,  pulmonary,  gastrointestinal  and  renal  effects.  Single  doses  were  given.  A  modified 
Irwin  test  was  performed  in  mice  at  oral  dosages  of  up  to  30  mg/kg  for  testing  potential  effects  of 
linagliptin  on  the  Central  Nervous  System  (CNS).  No  compound-induced  effect  was  seen  suggesting 
the absence of any influence of linagliptin on overt behaviour at the tested dosages. 
For assessing effects on renal function and clinical chemistry parameters, rats were treated orally with 
a  dose  of  3,  10  or  30  mg/kg  linagliptin.  Based  on  the  endpoints  of  the  study  linagliptin  did  not 
influence kidney function or integrity. 
Metformin 
No  secondary  pharmacodynamic  assays  were  performed  with  metformin.  These  studies  were  not 
considered necessary in view of the extensive clinical experience accumulated over the many years on 
the market. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  performed  on 
the 
fixed  dose  combination 
linagliptin/metformin based on the data available for each compound which was considered acceptable.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Linagliptin 
The core battery studies (ICHS7A and ICHS7B) were all conducted according to GLP except for the in 
vitro assays. Single doses were given if not stated otherwise. 
Potential effects on the CNS were investigated in rats after oral administration of 6, 60 or 600 mg/kg 
linagliptin.  In  a  modified  Irwin  study,  no  marked  or  consistent  behavioural  or  physiological  changes 
were  seen.  In  addition,  no  significant  effects  on  body  temperature  or  spontaneous  locomotor  activity 
were observed. 
Jentadueto 
CHMP assessment report

A  comprehensive  cardiovascular  profiling  was  performed  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.  Linagliptin  had  no 
effect  on  the  hERG-mediated  potassium  current  at  concentrations  up  to  10  μM.  In  the  Guinea  pig 
papillary muscle assay, concentrations up to  10 μM did not affect resting  membrane  potential, action 
potential  amplitude  and  overshoot,  and  maximal  upstroke  velocity.  There  was  a  concentration 
dependent shortening of the action potential beginning at 0.3 μM that increased up to a 7% shortening 
(of APD90) at 10 μM. These in vitro studies indicated that linagliptin has a low proarrhytmic potential 
based  on  a  delayed  ventricular  repolarization.  Potential  in  vivo  effects  of  linagliptin  on  the 
cardiovascular system were studied in the telemetered Cynomolgus monkey at dosages of 12, 60 and 
150  mg/kg.  High  plasma  concentrations  of  up  to  18900  nM  (1703x  clinical  Cmax)  were  reached  at  a 
dose of 150 mg/kg. There were no relevant treatment-related changes in the ECG (lead II) at doses up 
to 150 mg/kg. Cardiovascular investigations were also conducted in repeat-dose toxicity studies. In the 
4-week  toxicity  study  in  Beagle  dogs,  doses  up  to  9  mg/kg/day  (210x  clinical  Cmax)  were  free  from 
any  relevant  effect  of  linagliptin  on  blood  pressure,  heart  rate  and  ECG.  Changes  seen  at  45 
mg/kg/day  (955x  clinical  Cmax)  were  considered  to  be  pseudo-allergy  related.  In  Cynomolgus 
monkeys, which did not show any signs of pseudo-allergy after oral administration with linagliptin, no 
treatment-related changes were detected in the ECG and blood pressure measurements in the toxicity 
studies  up  to  12  months  duration  and  at  dosages  up  to  and  including  300  mg/kg/day  (2523x  clinical 
Cmax). In conclusion, the preclinical safety data did not indicate any linagliptin-related cardiovascular 
risk. 
Effects  on  respiratory  function  were  tested  in  rats  given  oral  dosages  of  0,  6,  60  or  600  mg/kg 
linagliptin.  Oral  dosages  of  6  or  60  mg/kg  produced  no  effect  on  respiratory  rate,  tidal  volume  and 
minute  volume.  At  a  dosage  of  600  mg/kg,  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  tidal  volume  and  a 
significant decrease in respiration rate and minute volume at 30 min post-dose were seen. A dose level 
of  600  mg/kg  was  associated  with  a  plasma  level  of  3099x  clinical  Cmax.  Therefore,  the  slight  and 
isolated  respiratory  effects  seen  at  600  mg/kg  are  considered  to  be  without  relevance  for  human 
safety. 
In  conclusion,  the  safety  pharmacology  assessment  of  neurological,  cardiovascular  and  respiratory 
effects supports the clinical development of linagliptin.  
Metformin 
No  formal  safety  pharmacology  studies  have  been  performed  on  metformin.  These  studies  were  not 
considered  necessary  by  the  CHMP  in  view  of  the  extensive  clinical  experience  accumulated  over  the 
many years on the market. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination  linagliptin/metformin 
based on the data available for each compound which was considered acceptable as well.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug 
interaction 
studies  were 
submitted 
for 
the 
combination 
linagliptin/metformin based on the data available for each compound which is considered acceptable.

2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Linagliptin 
The  HPLC-MS/MS  assay  for  the  quantification  of  linagliptin  has  been  validated  adequately  in  rat 
plasma.  Acceptable  linearity,  precision,  accuracy  and  specificity  of  linagliptin  were  observed  over  the 
concentration range 0.100 to 100 nmol/L. 
Metformin 
The  HPLC-MS/MS  method  for  the  measurement  of  metformin  has  been  validated  adequately  in  rat 
plasma. Acceptable linearity, precision, accuracy and specificity of metformin were observed over the 
concentration range 50 to 25000 nM. 
Absorption 
Linagliptin 
In  vitro  studies  showed  that  linagliptin  is  a  moderately  permeable  drug  and  a  substrate  for 
P-glycoprotein.  Linagliptin  is  a  substrate  for  OATP8,  OCT2,  OAT4,  OCTN1  and  OCTN2,  suggesting  a 
possible  OATP8-mediated  hepatic  uptake,  OCT2-mediated  renal  uptake  and  OAT4-,  OCTN1-  and 
OCTN2-mediated renal secretion and re-absorption of linagliptin in vivo. 
Oral bioavailability of linagliptin appeared to be moderate in mice (18-44%), rats (51-55%), monkeys 
(41-69%)  and  humans  (30%).  Maximum  blood  concentrations  of  linagliptin  were  generally  reached 
between  5 minutes  and  1  h  post-dose  in  mice,  rabbits  and  monkeys.  In  the  rat,  the  maximum  blood 
concentration  was  between  0.5  and  4  h  post-dose  following  oral  administration.  After  oral 
administration  of  5  or  15  mg/kg  linagliptin  in  mice,  AUC0-∞  and  C max  increased  more  than 
proportionally with dose. This indicates non-linear mechanisms in the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin in 
mice  in  this  dose  range.  Non-linear  pharmacokinetic  behavior  of  linagliptin  was  also  observed  in  rats 
and rabbits, which may be due to a saturation of P-glycoprotein mediated active secretion and DPP-4 
binding.  Food  had  a  moderate  influence  on  the  plasma  profiles  of  linagliptin  but  not  on  the  overall 
extent of absorption in rats. 
Metformin 
Metformin  hydrochloride  is  highly  soluble  but  lowly  permeable.  Thus,  metformin  can  be  classified  as 
BCS class III drug. The oral bioavailability in rats was low to moderate (about 30%) in the dose range 
between 50 and 200 mg/kg. Passive permeation, active uptake by cation transporters (e.g. PMAT) or 
other saturable processes may play a role in oral absorption of metformin. This could cause non-linear 
pharmacokinetics. However metformin showed a linear PK profile between 50 and 900 mg/kg in rats. 
This  may  be  due  to  the  investigated  dose  range,  where  transport  mechanisms  are  already  saturated 
and non-linear PK could be expected at markedly lower doses only. Although the overall contribution of 
metabolic  transformation  of  metformin  is  low,  a  slight  entero-hepatic  first  pass  metabolism  was 
suggested in rats. No studies addressing the absorption of metformin have been performed to support 
this application. The above data are based on published literature and this was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP.

Toxicokinetic  studies  with  linagliptin/metformin  combination  administration  in  rats  showed  that  the 
exposure  to  linagliptin  increased  less  than  dose-proportional,  whereas  the  exposure  to  metformin 
increased dose proportionally between 500 and 1000 mg/kg but less than dose proportionally between 
1000  and  2000  mg/kg.  The  dose-proportionality  of  linagliptin  is  in  contrast  with  earlier  findings  after 
administration  of  linagliptin  alone,  where  the  exposure  increased  more  than  dose-proportional.  The 
CHMP  agrees  with  the  Applicant  that  this  could  be  explained  by  the  different  dose  ranges  used.  At 
doses lower than 10 mg/kg, the disposition of linagliptin is mainly determined by saturable binding to 
plasma and tissue DPP-4. However, it should be noted that in case of high doses or overdosing of the 
linagliptin/metformin combination the AUC may increase more than dose-proportional.  
No effect of linagliptin on metformin kinetics was observed. However, co-administration with metformin 
did  affect  linagliptin  kinetics:  the  AUC  of  linagliptin  was  higher  (1.4-  to  2-fold)  with  metformin  (800 
mg/kg) compared to administration without metformin at day 1 in both male and female rats.  
It was shown in rats that the feeding status only influenced the shape of the plasma level time curve 
and  not  the  oral  absorption  of  linagliptin.  The  exposure  (AUC)  to  linagliptin  was  unaffected  by  the 
feeding conditions. As stated in the SmPC, food decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption 
of metformin hydrochloride. Some accumulation (up to a factor 1.9) of both linagliptin and metformin 
was  observed  after  repeated  doses  in  the  2-week  combination  toxicity  study  in  rats,  while 
accumulation was not consistently found in the 13-week combination toxicity study in rats. Thus, some 
accumulation of linagliptin in rat plasma after repeated dosing can not be excluded.  
Distribution 
Linagliptin 
The distribution of linagliptin was dominated by the binding to its target DPP-4 in plasma and tissues at 
low  doses.  A  pronounced  concentration-dependency  was  observed  in  the  plasma  protein  binding  of 
linagliptin.  A  very  high  binding  percentage  of  about  99%  at  concentrations  up  to  about  1  nM  was 
observed.  At  concentrations  beyond  about  30  nM,  the  plasma  protein  binding  was  constant  with  a 
moderate  bound  fraction  between  70  and  80%.  The  concentration  dependency  was  shown  to  be 
caused by high affinity saturable binding to soluble DPP-4 in plasma. Thus, the plasma concentration of 
soluble  DPP-4  may  have  an  influence  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  linagliptin  and  changes  in  plasma 
protein  binding  are  expected  at  therapeutic  plasma  levels  in  humans  (Cmax,ss  of  11.1  nM). 
Additionally,  it  should  be  noted,  that  plasma  concentrations  achieved  in  toxicology  studies  were 
generally  in  a  range  where  DPP-4  binding  of  linagliptin  in  plasma  is  saturated.  Thus,  plasma  protein 
binding  of  linagliptin  in  toxicology  studies  was  lower  than  in  humans  during  therapeutic  treatment 
adding an additional safety margin in terms of unbound exposure.

Extensive tissue distribution was indicated by high volumes of distribution in all species (>4 l/kg). This 
was confirmed by whole body autoradiography in rats. Linagliptin is extensively distributed into tissues 
and  long  retention  times  are  observed  in  DPP-4  containing  tissues,  in  particular  the  kidneys  and  the 
liver. Alike plasma protein binding, also tissue distribution of linagliptin is dominated by DPP-4 binding 
as  shown  in  mice  and  rats.  Kidney  and  liver  were  shown  to  contain  the  major  fraction  of  total  body 
DPP-4  in  mice  and  rats  and  therefore  the  high  and  persistent  tissue  levels  of  linagliptin  even  at  low 
doses  are  due  to  high-affinity  binding  to  DPP-4.  Once  DPP-4  is  saturated,  tissue  concentrations 
increased  linearly  with  dose  due  to  nonspecific  binding.  This  is  in  line  with  the  still  high  volumes  of 
distribution  observed  in  DPP-4  deficient  rats  which  indicate  DPP-4  independent  tissue  distribution. 
Complete saturation of DPP-4 in tissue can be assumed in all toxicology studies and high exposure to 
linagliptin was demonstrated in Cynomolgus monkey liver and kidney tissue sampled from the animals 
of the 52 week toxicity study. Despite the long residence times in tissues and the long terminal half-life 
in  plasma,  steady  state  is  achieved  quickly  after  repeated  dosing  and  only  a  limited  accumulation  in 
tissues  occurs.  Thus,  during  chronic  use  of  low  doses  of  linagliptin,  steady  state  in  tissue  will  be 
achieved  quickly  once  DPP-4  is  saturated.  Traces  of  covalently  bound  radioactivity  were  found  in 
plasma  of  animals  and  humans,  which  were  regarded  as  of  negligible  importance  considering  the 
exceptionally low levels and the low therapeutic dose of linagliptin.  
Linagliptin crosses the placenta barrier in rats and rabbits. Foetal exposure in rats reached about 50% 
of  the  maternal  exposure,  whereas  2-5%  was  found  in  foetuses  of  rabbits.  Foetal  exposure  differs 
between rats and rabbits, but the foetal exposure in humans is unknown. Placental transfer in humans 
is expected based on the results in rats and rabbits. 
Metformin 
The plasma protein binding of metformin is very low. In rat plasma, only about 15% were reported to 
be protein bound in vitro. In addition, a bound fraction of about 10% was determined in a solution of 
4% human serum albumin. 
In rat blood, metformin is distributed slightly more into plasma than into or onto blood cells. The mean 
plasma-to-blood  cell  partition  ratio  was  reported  to  be  about  1.3  independent  of  concentrations 
between  1  and  20  μg/mL  (7.7-230  μM)  metformin.  Metformin  showed  a  slow  association  but  also  a 
slow disappearance from erythrocytes. 
Metformin  showed  a  moderate  to  high  volume  of  distribution  (2-3  l/kg)  in  rats,  indicating  extensive 
tissue distribution. This was confirmed experimentally by dosing [14C]radiolabelled metformin to mice 
and rats. High radioactivity concentrations were found in the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver and 
the  salivary  glands  at  concentrations  higher  than  in  blood.  Lower  levels  were  observed  in  the  heart, 
skeletal muscle, white fat and brain, the latter indicating that metformin and/or metabolites may cross 
the blood brain barrier. Liver concentrations of metformin in rats were about 3 - 4 times higher than 
plasma concentrations of metformin. The distribution into the isolated perfused rat liver was shown to 
be  permeability  limited  and  that  in  the  organic  cation  transporter  OCT1  knockout  mice  the  liver 
concentrations were about 30 times lower than in wild type mice (study  R10-2435). Thus, OCT1 was 
suggested to be responsible for hepatic uptake of metformin. The same study also demonstrated that 
OCT1  was  also  involved  in  the  intestinal  uptake  of  metformin.  In  a  comparative  study,  it  was 
demonstrated  that  the  tissue  uptake  clearance  of  metformin  in  rats  is  markedly  higher  in  the  kidney 
than in the liver. It was concluded that metformin transport by renal OCT2 plays a dominant role for its 
pharmacokinetics whereas OCT1, which is expressed in both liver and kidney in rats and expressed in 
human liver is of subordinate importance. 
Metformin crosses the blood-placenta-barrier in humans and the foetus is exposed to metformin.

Linagliptin/metformin 
No  distribution  PK  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination  linagliptin/metformin  which 
was considered acceptable based on the data provided for the individual compounds.  
Metabolism 
Linagliptin 
The  elimination  of  linagliptin  in  mice,  rats  and  female  rabbits  was  governed  by  non-metabolic 
mechanisms.  Unchanged  parent  compound  was  the  most  abundant  component  in  urine,  faeces,  bile 
and  plasma  of  animals  except  for  Cynomolgus  monkeys.  In  monkey  bile  and  faeces  metabolites  of 
linagliptin  dominated.  Linagliptin  is  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  in  humans.  There  was  no  indication  for  a 
contribution  of  other  CYP  enzymes  in  the  metabolism  of  linagliptin.  After  oral  dosing,  the 
pharmacologically  inactive  metabolite  CD1790  was  the  only  circulating  metabolite  with  a  systemic 
exposure in human plasma of >10% of parent compound systemic exposure at steady state. CYP3A4 is 
involved  into  formation  of  CD1790  in  humans.  Thus,  co-administered  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  may 
influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of linagliptin  and  decrease  formation  of CD1790.  Linagliptin is  a weak 
competitive and a weak to moderate mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not 
inhibit other CYP isozymes. It is not an inducer of CYP isozymes. 
Linagliptin is not an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450. However, linagliptin weakly inhibited CYP3A4 
activity  in  human  liver  microsomes  competitively.  Additionally,  weak  to  moderate  mechanism  based 
(irreversible)  inhibition  of  CYP3A4  by  linagliptin  was  observed  (IC50=36.3  μM  (testosterone  6ß-
hydroxylation);  IC50=41.6  μM  (erythromycin  N-demethylation);  IC50>100  μM  (midazolam  1-
hydroxylation and nifedipine oxidation)). Considering the very low plasma concentrations of linagliptin 
in  humans  (C max,ss  of  11.1  nM)  and  its  high  plasma  protein  binding  at  therapeutic  plasma  levels  in 
humans, it is very that linagliptin interacts on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered drugs. 
Metformin 
No  relevant  inhibition  of  CYPs  by  metformin  was  observed.  The  overall  contribution  of  metabolic 
transformation  of  metformin  to  its  elimination  is  low.  However,  in  a  recent  study  it  was  shown  that 
metformin  is  metabolized  via  CYP2C11,  2D1  and  3A1/2  in  rats.  A  slight  first  pass  metabolism  was 
observed in rats. Thus, although excretion of unchanged parent compound is the determining route of 
elimination,  additional  metabolic  transformation  of  metformin  is  indicated.Co-administration  with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers could affect the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin. There was no indication 
of  a  mechanism-based  inhibition  of  CYP3A4  by  metformin.  Therefore,  metabolic  interactions  between 
linagliptin and metformin, based on inhibition of CYP3A4 are not expected.  
Linagliptin/metformin 
Metabolism  of  the  FDC  linagliptin/metformin  is  described  below  under  Pharmacokinetic  drug 
interactions.

Excretion 
Linagliptin 
Across species, the dominant excretion route was via the faeces. The urinary excretion was shown to 
be  dose-dependent  in  mice  and  rats.  At  an  oral  dose  of  1  mg/kg,  less  than  1%  of  the  dose  was 
excreted  in  urine,  whereas  up  to  about  20%  of  the  dose  was  excreted  with  urine  at  30  mg/kg.  As 
demonstrated in mice, the dose-dependency of renal excretion can be attributed to a saturable binding 
of linagliptin to its target DPP-4 in tissue and plasma. Biliary excretion is prominent and P-glycoprotein 
was  shown  to  be  involved  into  elimination  with  bile.  Despite  a  prominent  biliary  excretion  of  parent 
drug, the entero-hepatic recirculation of linagliptin was lower than expected. This was attributed to a 
negative effect of bile on its absorption in anaesthetised rats. Besides the biliary excretion (about 80% 
within  6  hours  after  iv  administration  of  1  mg/kg  linagliptin),  about  12%  of  the  dose  was  directly 
secreted  into  the  intestinal  lumen,  independently  of  biliary  excretion.  It  is  likely  that  P-gp  mediated 
efflux  is  involved  into  active  secretion  of  linagliptin  from  the  blood  into  the  gut  lumen  in  rats.  In 
comparison  to  biliary  excretion,  direct  secretion  into  gut  represents  a  minor  route  of  elimination. 
Nevertheless, it may become more important in case of hepatic (and renal) elimination impairment. 
Metformin 
The  by  far  dominating  excretion  pathway  is  renal  elimination  of  unchanged  parent  compound.  Active 
secretion involving hMATE2-K and hOCT2 in the proximal tubules of the kidney is suggested in addition 
to  glomerular  filtration.  Biliar  excretion  was  low.  As  mentioned  previously,  the  compound  is  mainly 
excreted unchanged. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No excretion PK studies were performed on the fixed dose combination linagliptin/metformin which was 
considered acceptable.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Linagliptin 
No  in  vivo  drug-drug  interaction  studies  were  performed  in  animals.  For  drug  transporters  or  drug 
metabolizing enzymes where linagliptin was identified as inhibitor, relevant inhibition only occurs in the 
micromolar  range.  Considering  the  very low  plasma  concentrations  of linagliptin in  humans  (Cmax,ss  of 
20  nM)  and  its  high  plasma  protein  binding  at  the  therapeutic  plasma  levels  in  humans,  it  is  very 
unlikely, that linagliptin interacts on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered drugs. The same applies 
for the main metabolite CD 1790.  
Linagliptin is a substrate for P-gp. In addition, linagliptin undergoes a minor metabolism in humans and 
the  main  metabolite  CD  1790  is  formed  by  CYP  3A4.  Thus,  co-administered  drugs  which  act  on  P-gp 
and/or CYP 3A4 may have an influence on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin.  
Metformin 
Metformin  is  mainly  excreted  unchanged  via  urine.  However,  it  was  shown  that  metformin  is 
metabolized via CYP2C11, 2D1 and 3A1/2 in the rat. Several rat studies demonstrated pharmacokinetic 
interactions  with  metformin  and  co-administered  drugs  which  are  substrates  for  CYP3A1/2  e.g. 
telithromycin  or  DA-8159  leading  to  decreased  metformin  clearance  in  rats.  In  addition,  altered 
pharmacokinetics  of  metformin  were  described  in  disease  models,  where  hepatic  expression  levels  of 
these CYPs are changed, e.g. streptozotocin induced diabetes in rats  or challenge of E. coli LPS in rats.

Linagliptin/metformin  
Metabolism by CYP enzymes 
In vitro, it was demonstrated that metformin does not inhibit any of the investigated CYP isoforms in 
vivo.  Thus,  as  the  only  CYP  isoform  involved  into  the  metabolism  of  linagliptin  is  CYP3A4,  co-
administration  of  metformin  should  not  alter  the  metabolism  of  linagliptin.  This  was  confirmed  in  a 
clinical  study  where  no  clinical  meaningful  interaction  was  observed.  The  contribution  of  metabolic 
transformation to the overall elimination of metformin in human is very low if at all present. Linagliptin 
was  shown  to  be  a  moderate  to  poor  mechanism  based  (irreversible)  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  in  vitro. 
However,  in  a  clinical  study  no  clinically  relevant  interaction  was  observed  between  linagliptin  and 
simvastatin,  a  known  model  substrate  for  CYP3A4.  No  consistent  or  relevant  interactions  have  been 
observed in the toxicokinetic studies, where also supratherapeutic doses of both compound were dosed 
repeatedly in rats. Thus, drug-drug-interactions between linagliptin and metformin on a CYP level are 
extremely unlikely to occur. 
Binding to plasma proteins 
Metformin  does  not  bind  notably  to  plasma  proteins  in  rats  and  humans  and  therefore,  linagliptin 
cannot  influence  metformin  pharmacokinetics  by  interaction  on  the  plasma  protein  binding  level.  In 
addition, the plasma protein binding of linagliptin at therapeutic doses is characterised by a very high 
affinity  and  high  specifity  as  it  binds  to  soluble  plasma  DPP-4.  On  the  other  hand,  it  was  shown  that 
metformin does not inhibit DPP-4 in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, drug-drug interactions between 
metformin and linagliptin with respect to plasma protein binding are unlikely. 
Transport by drug-transporters 
Linagliptin  and  metformin  are  both  substrates  for  OCTs.  In  addition,  linagliptin  was  identified  as  an 
inhibitor  of  OCT1  with  and  IC50  value  of  47.2  μM.  Thus,  upon  oral  administration  of  5  mg  linagliptin 
local  intestinal  concentrations  in  the  range  of  the  IC50  might  be  produced.  However,  such  high 
concentrations  of  linagliptin  in  the  gut  would  only  be  present  for  a  transient  period  and  thus,  OCT1 
inhibition in the gut would be limited if at all present. In all other tissues where OCT1 is expressed and 
also  in  plasma,  the  unbound  concentrations  of  linagliptin  are  far  below  the  IC50  value  for  OCT1 
inhibition, considering the low therapeutic plasma levels. Finally, the role of OCT1 mediated transport 
of metformin is recognized as of minor importance. In addition, in particular OCT2, which is expressed 
on  the  basolateral  membrane  of  the  renal  proximal  tubule  cells,  was  shown  to  play  a  central  role  in 
renal  elimination  of  metformin.  Due  to  low  therapeutic  plasma  concentration  of  linagliptin  and 
linagliptin  being  not  an  inhibitor  of  OCT2,  a  competitive  inhibition  of  OCT2  mediated  metformin 
transport  by  linagliptin  in  the  kidney  can  be  excluded  although  linagliptin  was  shown  to  distribute 
extensively into kidneys. 
Metformin is reported to be a substrate of MATE and PMAT which are expressed on the brush boarder 
membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. Kidney distribution of linagliptin is due to high affinity binding 
to  kidney  DPP-4.  Thus,  even  in  tissues  with  high  concentrations  of  total  linagliptin,  only  a  very  low 
unbound concentration can be expected as most of the compound is bound tightly to DPP-4. Hence, a 
competitive inhibition of MATE and PMAT mediated metformin transport by linagliptin in the kidney can 
be excluded. On the other hand, the high doses of metformin may theoretically lead to a competitive 
inhibition  of  uptake  or  efflux  transporters  for  linagliptin.  However,  no  indications  were  found,  that  an 
active uptake is involved in the gastrointestinal absorption of linagliptin.

CHMP assessment report

Furthermore,  it  was  demonstrated  in  rats,  that  oral  absorption  and  biliary  excretion  of  linagliptin  is 
influenced by P-gp. However, metformin most likely is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-gp and 
therefore P-gp mediated interactions are not expected. 
In  addition,  linagliptin  was  shown  to  be  a  substrate  for  OCT2  (but  not  OCT1).  Thus,  metformin  could 
theoretically  influence  the  pharmacokinetics  of  linagliptin  by  competing  for  OCT2  in  the  kidney 
decreasing  the  renal  clearance  of  linagliptin.  However,  renal  excretion  of  linagliptin  is  of  almost 
negligible  importance  for  its  elimination.  Thus,  clinically  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interactions  at  an 
OCT2  mediated  mechanism  are  not  expected,  which  was  confirmed  in  the  clinical  study.  Taken 
together,  based  on  the  available  non-clinical  data,  clinically  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interaction 
between metformin and linagliptin at the respective therapeutic dose levels is not expected in humans. 
2.3.4. Toxicology 
The  toxicity  of  linagliptin  has  been  evaluated  in  an  extensive  non-clinical  program.  The  toxicology 
program included single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, in vivo 
and  in  vitro  genotoxicity  studies,  reproduction  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  and  carcinogenicity 
studies.  Although  metformin  has  been  marketed  for  many  years,  there  are  only  limited  non-clinical 
data  available  in  published  literature.  Therefore,  the  general  and  reproductive  toxicity  of  metformin 
was  investigated  in  additional  rat  studies.  Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  and  reproduction  toxicity 
studies  were  conducted  with  the  FDC  linagliptin/metformin.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the 
non-clinical 
development 
of 
fixed 
combinations 
of 
medicinal 
products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).

Oral  acute  toxicity  studies  in  mice  and  rats  were  repeated  with  a  different  batch  of  linagliptin  due  to 
differences  in  the  impurity  profile  between  the  batches  used  in  early  toxicological  investigations  and 
the one produced for an early clinical study. The acute toxicity of linagliptin in mice and rats was low 
as indicated by a maximum non-lethal dose of ≤1000 mg/kg. 
Metformin 
Acute toxicity of metformin was not studied in single-dose studies, but information about this endpoint 
was  obtained  from  short-duration  toxicity  studies  in  rats.  These  data  indicated  that  the  ALD  of 
metformin is above 1000 mg/kg.  
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination  linagliptin/metformin 
which was considered acceptable based on the data available for each compound.

Liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract were identified as the principal target organs of toxicity in mice 
and  rats  at  high  doses  of  linagliptin  at  repeat  doses  (≥100  mg/kg/day,  >300x  Maximum 
Recommended  Human  Dose  (MRHD)  based  on  AUC).  In  rats  also  effects  on  reproductive  organs, 
thyroid  and  the  lymphoid  organs  were  seen  (≥60  mg/kg/day,  >150x  MRHD).  No  relevant  and 
consistent gender differences were observed. 
Strong  pseudo-allergic  reactions  were  observed  in  dogs  at  medium  doses  (≥15  mg/kg/day,  450x 
clinical  Cmax),  secondarily  causing  cardiovascular  changes,  which  were  considered  dog-specific. 
Therefore, no further repeat-dose testing has been performed with dogs. 
At  high  doses  of  linagliptin  (>1000x  MRHD,  based  on  AUC)  liver,  kidneys,  stomach,  reproductive 
organs,  thymus,  spleen,  and  lymph  nodes  were  target  organs  of  toxicity in  Cynomolgus monkeys.  At 
medium  dose  (>100x  MRHD)  irritation  of  the  stomach  is  the  major  finding.  No  important  gender 
difference is observed. Necrotic skin lesions, which were observed after administration of other DPP-4 
inhibitors, were not seen. The NOAEL of the longer oral toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys is 10 
mg/kg/day (40-66x MRHD).

Intravenous  administration  of  linagliptin  to  Cynomolgus  monkeys  at  high  dose  (40  mg/kg/day),  was 
associated with first degree atrioventricular block and signs indicative of pseudo-allergy. Because there 
was  no  relationship  between  the  signs  of  pseudo-allergy  and  histamine  plasma  concentrations,  this 
effect was not as clear as in dogs. Also this route of administration will not be used in human therapy; 
therefore, these findings will not be relevant for human use.

The  exposure  increased  almost  proportionally  with  dose.  Mean  metformin  plasma  AUC0-24h  values  at 
dose levels of 100, 200 or 1000 mg/kg/day were 178, 374 and 2790 μM·h. The respective Cmax values 
were 38.2, 70.1 or 204 μM. There was no gender related effect. 
No  adverse  findings  were  seen  at  100  and  200  mg/kg/day  (2.4x  MRHD)  metformin.  At  1000 
mg/kg/day (17.5x MRHD), body weight gain was slightly decreased (terminal body weight 0.9x relative 
to control). The organ weights of the heart (1.3x relative to control), liver (1.3x) and adrenals (1.2x) 
were increased. In addition, a statistically significant increase in pituitary weights (1.2x) was noted in 
females.  Thymus  weights  were  reduced  (0.8x).  In  correlation  with  the  increased  heart  weights,  a 
concentric  hypertrophy  of  the  ventricle  myocardium  was  observed.  The  adrenal  medulla  (zona 
fasciculata)  was  affected  by  a  minimal  to  slight  cytoplasmic  vacuolation.  Hyperplasia  of  the  pituitary 
gland  (pars  distalis)  was  found  in  females,  atrophy  of  the  seminal  vesicles  was  seen  in  males.  There 
were  also  alterations  of  the  parotid  salivary  gland  and  size  reduction  of  the  cortical  areas  of  the 
thymus.  In  addition,  depletion  of  pancreatic  zymogen  granules  was  found,  a  finding  which  often 
correlates with under nutrition. 
At  high  dose  (17.5  x  MRHD)  the  target  organs  of  metformin  in  the  rat  are  heart,  liver,  adrenals, 
pituitary and thymus. The NOAEL is found at 200 mg/kg (2.4 x MRHD).

* This non-GLP study has been designed to comply with international guidelines on repeated dose toxicity studies, 
e.g. “Note for Guidance on Repeated Dose Toxicity”, CPMP/SWP/1042/99 and Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Oral 2-week dose range finding study in rats  
At the 2.5/500 mg/kg/day dose level (2.9x MRHD for linagliptin, 11x MRHD for metformin), increases 
in heart weight (1.3x relative to control) and adrenals weight (1.2x) were observed. Histopathological 
changes  were  seen  in  heart  (inflammation),  the  thymus  (apoptosis),  adrenal  gland  (cytoplasmic 
vaculoation) and parotid salivary gland (vacuolation). 
Dosages  of  5/1000  mg/kg/day  linagliptin/metformin,  led  to  slight  decrease  in  body  weight  gain 
(terminal body weight 0.9x relative to control). The weights of the heart (1.4x relative to control), liver 
(1.3x)  and  adrenals  (1.5x)  were  increased.  Thymus  weights  were  reduced  (0.6x).  Histopathological 
changes  were  noted  in  heart  (hypertrophy  of  the  myocardium),  liver  (cytoplasmic  vacuolation  in 
females),  salivary  glands  (vacuolation), 
thymus  (apoptosis),  adrenal  medulla  (cytoplasmic 
vacuolation), seminal vesicles (atrophy), and pancreas (depletion of zymogen granules).

Linagliptin/metformin  given  at  dosages  of  10/2000  mg/kg/day  exceeded  the  MTD.  Mortality  occurred 
already after a single administration and the remaining animals were prematurely sacrificed. 
Oral 2-week toxicity study in rats  
There  were  no  drug  related  findings  in  all  dose  groups.  In  conclusion,  the  NOAEL  of  the  2-week 
combination  study  in  rats  was  set  at  1/200  mg/kg/day  linagliptin/metformin  (1.9x  MRHD  for 
linagliptin/2.8x MRHD for metformin). 
Oral 3-month toxicity study in rats 
Linagliptin and metformin showed a different dose-exposure relationship in the tested dose range. The 
exposure to linagliptin increased less than proportionally with dose between 0.5 and 4.0 mg/kg/day. In 
contrast,  the  exposure  to  metformin  at  steady  state  increased  more  than  proportionally  with  dose 
between 100 and 800 mg/kg/day.  
At 800 mg/kg/day metformin alone or in combination with linagliptin (linagliptin/metformin at a dosage 
of 0/800, 2.0/800 or 4.0/800 mg/kg/day, associated with 20.9x, 23.3 or22.8 x MRHD for metformin,) 
the  organ  weights  of  the  heart  (up  to  1.6x  relative  to  control),  liver  (1.6x),  kidneys  (1.4x),  and 
adrenals (1.6x) were increased. Thymus weights were reduced (0.6x). The ovarian (1.4x) and pituitary 
(0.9x) weights were affected in females. Plasma glucose was reduced (0.7x) and ALT slightly increased 
(up to 1.8x). Histopathological changes were noted in the heart (hypertrophy of the myocardium), liver 
(hepatocellular  hypertrophy),  kidneys  (basophilic  tubules),  salivary  glands  (hypertrophy),  thymus 
(apoptosis),  adrenals  (hypertrophy),  ovaries  (increased  number  of  corpora  lutea),  stomach  (erosion) 
and  intestine.  As  the  findings  were  seen  in  a  comparable  grading  in  all  groups  receiving  800 
mg/kg/day metformin alone or in combination with linagliptin, all adverse effects were attributable to 
metformin. This also indicates that there was no enhancement of metformin-related toxicity, which is 
caused by the co-administration of linagliptin. 
The only observed interaction between linagliptin and metformin was related to body weight gain. The 
decrease  of  body  weight  gain  induced  by  metformin  was  magnified  by  linagliptin.  At  800  mg/kg/day 
metformin the terminal body weight was 0.9x relative to control. Co-administration of 4.0 mg/kg/day 
linagliptin  enhanced  this  effect  to  0.8x  relative  to  control.  This  effect  is  considered  not  adverse  but 
rather an additive pharmacodynamic effect of the two anti-diabetic compounds. 
Linagliptin/metformin  at  2.0/400  mg/kg/day  also  decreased  body  weight  gain  (terminal  body  weight 
0.9x control). In addition, similar effects on organ weights and histology described for the animals at 
0/800, 2.0/800 and 4.0/800 mg/kg/day were seen but at a lower degree.  
In conclusion, a NOAEL for linagliptin/metformin of 0.5/100 mg/kg/day (1.0x MRHD for linagliptin, 1.4x 
MRHD for metformin) was derived. All adverse findings seen in the study were attributed to metformin. 
The only combination effect attributable to the linagliptin/metformin combination itself was related to 
body  weight  gain.  There  was  no  enhancement  of  metformin-related  organ  toxicity  due  to  the  co-
administration of linagliptin.

The potential genotoxicity of the main metabolite CD 1790 of linagliptin was also assessed in the Ames 
test and in the chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes.  
No specific in vivo test with CD 1790 was performed as this metabolite is present in all animal species 
used for toxicological testing. In the rat the plasma level of CD 1790 was about 3-5% compared to the 
parent  compound  linagliptin  based  on  AUC.  In  the  rat  bone  marrow  micronucleus  test,  in  which 
dosages of up to 600 mg/kg/day of linagliptin were administered, an exposure of approximately 20000 
nM.h  CD  1790  (corresponding  to  1000-fold  clinical  exposure  of  CD  1790)  was  calculated.  It  can 
therefore be concluded that CD 1790 is also negative in the rat bone marrow micronucleus assay.

Metformin 
The  Ames  test,  gene  mutation  test  (mouse  lymphoma  cells),  chromosomal  aberrations  test  (human 
lymphocytes) and in vivo mouse micronucleus tests were negative with metformin.  
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  genotoxicity  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  combination  linagliptin/metformin  which  is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.

In  a  2-year  carcinogenicity  mouse  study,  linagliptin  did  not  induce  carcinogenic  effects,  except  for  a 
significant  increase  in  malignant  lymphomas  in  females  at  80  mg/kg/day  (242x  MRHD  for  linagliptin, 
27x MRHD for metabolite CD 1790). This was attributed to a high background of lymphomas in mice, 
and because linagliptin is not genotoxic, lymphoid hyperplasia in spleen and thymus was not increased 
in female mice, exposure in females was lower than in males, and occurred only at a very high dose, it 
was concluded that this finding is not relevant for humans. 
Oral administration of linagliptin up to 60 mg/kg/day to Wistar rats for 2 years revealed no evidence of 
a  carcinogenic  potential.  A  dosage  of  60  mg/kg/day  corresponds  to  418-times  clinical  exposure  for 
linagliptin and 185-times clinical exposure for the main metabolite CD 1790 at MRHD. 
Metformin 
Long-term  carcinogenicity  studies  with  metformin  have  been  performed  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats  at 
doses  of  150,  300,  and  450  mg/kg/day  in  males  and  150,  450,  900,  1200  mg/kg/day  in  females. 
These  doses  were  approximately  2,  4,  and  8  times  in  males,  and  3,  7,  12,  and  16  times  the 
therapeutic exposures based AUC values with the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 
mg/kg/day. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in neither male nor female rats.  
Linagliptin/metformin 
The  fixed  dose  combination  of  linagliptin/metformin  contains  two  compounds  assessed  as  non 
carcinogenic.  The  carcinogenic  potential  is  thus  fully  assessed.  Hence  other  studies  assessing 
carcinogenic potential with the combination are not needed in accordance with the requirements of the 
“Guideline  on  the  Non-Clinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combinations  of  Medicinal  Products 
“(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).

Fertility and early embryonic development 
Linagliptin 
In  rat  studies  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development,  a  NOAEL  of  30  mg/kg/day  (49x  MRHD) 
was  derived  for  paternal  and  maternal  toxicity.  No  effects  on  early  embryonic  development,  mating, 
fertility  and  bearing  live  young  were  observed  up  to  and  including  the  high  dosage  group  given  240 
mg/kg/day (943x MRHD). 
Metformin 
Fertility  of  male  or  female  rats  was  not  affected  by  metformin  when  administered  at  dose  up  to  600 
mg/kg/day,  which  is  approximately  3  times  the  maximum  recommended  human  daily  dose  based  on 
body surface area comparisons. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  combination 
linagliptin/metformin which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Linagliptin 
No teratogenic effects occurred in Wistar rats up to and including the high dose of 240 mg/kg/day 
linagliptin (943x MRHD). The NOAEL for both maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal toxicity was 30 
mg/kg/day (49x MRHD). 
No teratogenic effects were observed in Himalayan rabbits up to and including the high dose of 150 
mg/kg/day (1943x MRHD). A NOAEL of 25 mg/kg/day (78x MRHD) was derived for embryo-foetal 
toxicity. For maternal toxicity the NOAEL was 4 mg/kg/day (2.1x MRHD). 
Metformin 
Metformin  was  not  teratogenic  in  rats  and  rabbits  at  doses  up  to  600  mg/kg/day,  which  represent  3 
and  6  times  the  maximum  recommended  human  daily  dose  of  2000  mg  based  on  body  surface  area 
comparison for rats and rabbits, respectively. 
Maternal findings: data from GD 7 demonstrated a trend for dose related decrease of glucose levels 4, 
8  and  24  h  after  treatment  with  doses  of  500  mg/kg  and  1000  mg/kgThe  data  from  GD  16  did  not 
provide an indication for a trend to changed glucose levels in the 200 and 500 mg/kg dose groups at 
any time point. In the 1000 mg/kg dose group mean body weight during treatment period fluctuated 
on a slightly lower level than in the Control group. Mean body weight gain of the 200, 500 and 1000 
mg/kg dose groups was decreased.Fetal data: In the viscera shortened truncus brachiocephalicus and 
small  kidney  at  1000  mg/kg  were  seen.  The  skeleton  showed  delayed  ossification  indicating 
developmental retardation. Most variations occurred at 1000 mg/kg and three (parietal bone partly not 
ossified, orbitosphenoidal bone not ossified and calcaneus not ossified) at 500 mg/kg. At 1000 mg/kg 
split sternebra lateral axis, flat and thickened rib (unilateral and bilateral), and rib z-shaped (bilateral) 
as  well  as  single  unilateral  anophthalmia  and  single  unilateral  polydactylia  were  seen.  Flat  and 
thickened rib (bilateral) were also seen at 500 mg/kg. Scapula bent inwardly at 500 and 1000 mg/kg 
at  increased  incidence  and  in  all  cases  in  combination  with  flat  and  thickened  rib.  At  1000  mg/kg 
additionally combination with rib z-shaped was seen.

Linagliptin/metformin 
The  exposure  to  linagliptin  increased  less  than  proportionally  with  the  dose  between  1  and  5  mg/kg 
linagliptin.  The  AUC0-24h  of  metformin  increased  dose  proportionally  on  GD  7  and  more  than 
proportionally on GD 16. The mean exposure to metformin on GD 16 at 5/1000 mg/kg/day was about 
30 % higher than at 0/1000 mg/kg/day. 
Treatment  with  linagliptin  alone  showed  no  changes  in  blood  glucose  levels.  In  contrast,  reduction  of 
blood glucose concentrations (up to 0.6x relative to control) was noted at all exposures to formulations 
containing 500 and 1000 mg/kg metformin.  
In  all  dose  groups  treated  with  1000  mg/kg/day  metformin  alone  or  in  combination  with  linagliptin, 
means  of  body  weight  gain  were  significantly  decreased.  In  the  metformin  mono  group  (0/1000 
mg/kg/day),  this  effect  was  less  pronounced  than  in  the  2.5/1000  and  5/1000  mg/kg/day 
linagliptin/metformin combination groups. This indicates an additive pharmacodynamic effect on body 
weight gain induced by the administration of the two antidiabetic compounds.  
Findings  at  hysterectomy:  There  was  no  effect  on  the  mean  number  of  corpora  lutea,  implantations, 
viable fetuses, resorptions as well as fetal sex and group means of preimplantation loss and resorption 
rate.  Mean 
fetal  body  weight  was  significantly  decreased 
in 
the  5/1000  mg/kg/day 
linagliptin/metformin dose group, but the individual weights were still within the spontaneous historical 
range.  In  some  fetuses  with  ossification  delay  in  the  groups  given  2.5/1000  and  0/1000  mg/kg/day 
linagliptin/metformin,  individual  fetal  body  weights  were  slightly  decreased.  Most  skeletal  variations 
seen  at  1000  or  500  mg/kg/day  metformin  alone  or  in  combination  with  linagliptin  were  ossification 
delays pointing to developmental retardation which is regularly balanced during later development. 
At  a  dosage  of  1000  mg/kg/day  metformin  given  alone  or  in  combination  with  linagliptin  (animals 
dosed with linagliptin/metformin at 0/1000, 2.5/1000 and 5.0/1000 mg/kg/day, associated with 23.1x, 
24.1x and 30.3x MRHD for metformin), skeletal malformations (cleft thoracal vertebral body, flat and 
thickened  rib  and  scapula  bent  inwardly,  thickened  rib,  rib  zshaped)  were  observed.  Most  skeletal 
malformations  and  findings  without  classification  occurred  at  lower  incidences  than  in  the  1000 
mg/kg/day  metformin  mono  group  of  the  associated  embryo-foetal  development  study.  All  treatment 
related  adverse  effects  on  the  embryo  were  attributed  to  the  administration  of  1000  mg/kg/day 
metformin  and  there  was  no  indication  of  an  additive  teratogenic  effect  attributed  to  the  co-
administration  of  2.5  or  5.0  mg/kg/day  linagliptin.  One  single  visceral  malformation,  hydronephrosis, 
was  diagnosed  in  the  linagliptin/metformin  group  given  5.0/1000  mg/kg/day.  The  relationship  to 
treatment  is  uncertain.  Incidences  of  treatment  related  changes  in  the  linagliptin/metformin  group 
given 2.5/500 mg/kg/day were low. The comparison of this group with the 500 mg/kg/day metformin 
mono group of the associated embryo-foetal study did not reveal any differences which would suggest 
an additive adverse effect of linagliptin. No relevant foetal alterations and no teratogenicity occurred in 
animals  dosed  with  linagliptin/metformin  at  a  dosage  of  1.0/200  mg/kg/day  and  this  combination 
dosage  was  considered  to  be  the  NOAEL  (1.5x  MRHD  for  linagliptin,  3.3x  MRHD  for  metformin).  As 
mentioned  previously,  dosages  of  500  or  1000  mg/kg/day  metformin  (given  alone  or  in  combination 
with linagliptin) affected blood glucose levels. No effect on blood glucose was seen at 200 mg/kg/day 
metformin.  Therefore,  dysglycemia  and  foetal  morphological  changes  induced  by  metformin  may  be 
connected.  No  relevant  fetal  alterations  and  no  teratogenicity  occurred  in  the  linagliptin  mono  group 
given 5 mg/kg/day (3.0x MRHD). 
There were no embryo-toxic findings, which were related to linagliptin. There was no indication of an 
additive or even synergistic teratogenic effect of both compounds.

Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
Linagliptin 
In the pre- and postnatal development study, the NOAELs for maternal and offspring toxicity were 30 
mg/kg/day  (49x  MRHD).  Linagliptin  produced  maternal  toxicity  at  300  mg/kg/day  (1506x  MRHD).  At 
this dosage, there was also an influence of linagliptin on body weight and body weight development of 
the offspring. However, the offspring's fertility was not changed. 
Toxicokinetic studies in pregnant rats and rabbits showed that linagliptin and the main metabolite CD 
1790 crosses the placenta and is distributed into the embryo and fetus. Linagliptin was also shown to 
be excreted into maternal milk. 
Metformin 
Animal data of excretion of metformin in milk was not provided, but it has been found that metformin 
is excreted in human milk. The concentrations of metformin in breast milk were generally low and the 
mean  infant  exposure  to  the  drug  was  only  0.28%  of  the  weight-normalized  maternal  dose.  No  data 
regarding pre- and postnatal development after metformin administration are available. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  prenatal  and  post-natal  development  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  combination 
linagliptin/metformin which is considered acceptable by the CHMP based on the data available on both 
compounds 
Local Tolerance  
Linagliptin 
To  evaluate  the  tolerance  for  linagliptin  as  an  injection  solution,  several  studies  were  performed. 
Injectable  solutions  (0.5  mg/mL)  of  linagliptin  were  well  tolerated  after  a  single  paravenous,  intra-
arterial,  intravenous,  or  intramuscular  injection.  Linagliptin  was  also  well  tolerated  subsequent  to 
topical  application  on  rabbit  skin.  In  an  ex  vivo  study,  injectable  solutions  (0.5  mg/mL)  of  linagliptin 
induced no relevant hemolysis in human blood. 
Metformin 
No local tolerance studies have been performed with metformin. As Jentadueto is only intended for oral 
use this is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  local  toterance  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  combination  linagliptin/metformin  which  is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Linagliptin 
All  relevant  toxicity  studies  for  linagliptin  have  been  performed.  Antigenicity/immunotoxicity 
measurements were included in toxicological studies and no cause for concern was identified.  
Metformin 
No antigenic / immunotoxicity potential is known for metformin.

Linagliptin/metformin 
In  accordance  with  the  “Note  for  Guidance  on  Immunotoxicity  Studies  for  Human  Pharmaceuticals” 
(CHMP/167235/2004),  no  additional  information  is  considered  necessary  for  the  fixed  dose 
combination linagliptin/metformin as the individual components show no cause for concern. 
Studies on impurities 
Linagliptin 
In the proposed drug substance specification, the acceptance criteria of the linagliptin impurities were 
set  at  levels  above  the  qualification  threshold.  These  impurities  were  qualified  before  in  general 
toxicity, carcinogenicity and genotoxicity studies, and found negative. 
In  the  proposed  drug  product  specification,  the  acceptance  criteria  of  a  degradation  product  of 
linagliptin, was set at a level above the identification threshold. Although formally not needed, toxicity 
studies were performed to demonstrate the biological safety of this degradation product.

The  new  gene  mutation  study  of  the  degradation  product  caused  neither  base-pair  substitutions  nor 
frameshift  mutations  in  different  strains  of  S.  typhimurium  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  metabolic 
activation  when  tested  up  to  insoluble  concentrations.  Based  on  these  results  it  was  concluded,  that 
the test substance is "Ames negative".  
The  degradation  product,  using  the  chromosomal  aberration  test  in  human  lymphocytes  in  vitro,  did 
not  induce  an  increase  in  the  number  of  structural  and  numerical  chromosomal  aberrations  when 
tested  up  to  cytotoxic  and  insoluble  concentrations  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  metabolic 
activation.  Based  on  these  results  it  was  concluded,  that  the  test  substance  is  negative  in  this 
chromosomal aberration test. 
In  a  13-week  toxicity  study  in  the  rat,  the  degradation  product  was  spiked  in  at  a  concentration  of 
2.93%. The NOAEL derived in the study was 0.5 mg/kg/day linagliptin and a safety margin to human 
use of 35 for the degradation product was derived.

Metformin 
For  metformin  hydrochloride,  the  Applicant  makes  reference  to  a  CEP  from  the  manufacturer  of 
metformin  hydrochloride.  Metformin  hydrochloride  used  for  the  manufacture  of  linagliptin/metformin 
hydrochloride film coated tablets is released in accordance with the Ph. Eur. monograph as well as the 
CEP. There were no impurities in Meformin DS or DP which had to be qualified. 
2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) submitted for Jentadueto was prepared in compliance with 
the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). The two active substances linagliptin and metformin have been assessed 
separately. Predicted environmental concentrations exceeded the threshold value of 0.01 μL, triggering 
a Phase II – Tier A for both active substances. 
Linagliptin 
A  Phase  I  environmental  risk  assessment  was  performed  to  evaluate  potential  environmental  risks  of 
linagliptin. The log K ow was determined according to study OECD 122 with a value of 1.7. Based on the 
log  K ow  value  being  below  3,  linagliptin  is  not  expected  to  be  a  bio-accumulative  substance.  A 
PEC surfacewater  of  0.025  µg/L  was  calculated  using  the  default  Fpen  of  0.01.  Since  the  PEC surfacewater 
exceeded the threshold value of 0.01 μg/L, a phase II ERA was performed.  
The  outcome  of  the  phase  II  assessment  shows  that the  PEC/PNEC  ratios for  all  three  compartments 
are clearly below the trigger values of 1 and 0.1, respectively (see table below).

Therefore,  the  use  of  linagliptin  as  active  ingredient  with  the  use  pattern  as  given  above  can  be 
considered  to  result  in  insignificant  environmental  risk  for  the  three  aquatic  compartments.  Thus,  an 
extended  environmental  fate  and  effects  analysis  for  the  three  compartments  in  Tier  B  is  not 
considered to be necessary. 
Since  the  log  K ow  of  the  undissociated  compound  was  determined  to  be  below  3,  linagliptin  is 
considered  to  have  no  potential  to  bio-accumulate.  Therefore,  bio-concentration  does  not  have  to  be 
considered in Tier B.

The OECD 106 adsorption study was conducted with three different soils and two sewage sludges. The 
study  shows  that  the  normalisation  to  the  organic  carbon  (OC)  content  of  the  soils/sludges  is  not 
feasible due to the lack of direct correlation between adsorption of the substance and the OC content 
of the soils/sludges. Therefore, a Kd-trigger for sludge of 3700 L/kg (corresponding to the Koc-trigger 
of 10000 L/kg assuming a default OC content in sludge) is considered to be more reasonable than the 
Koc-trigger as proposed in the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). For the sludges, the OECD 106 adsorption study resulted 
in a Kd of 190 L/kg. Since this is below the trigger of 3700 L/kg, a terrestrial risk assessment was not 
considered in Tier B. 
The criterion for significant shifting to the sediment (10% of the substance at any time point after or at 
14  days  is  present  in  sediment)  is  exceeded  for  linagliptin.  Therefore,  effects  on  sediment  organisms 
were  considered  in  Tier  B  and  a  toxicity  study  on  chironomids  was  conducted.  Since  the  PEC/PNEC 
ratio is below the trigger of 1, it can be concluded that the use of linagliptin as active ingredient with 
the  use  pattern  as  given  above  can  be  considered  to  result in insignificant environmental  risk  for  the 
compartment sediment. 
Considering the above data, linagliptin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Metformin 
A  Phase  I  environmental  risk  assessment  was  performed  to  evaluate  potential  environmental  risks  of 
metformin.  The  log  K ow  was  determined  according  to  study  OECD  107  with  a  value  of  1.1  at  pH  7. 
Based  on  the  log  K ow  value  being  below  4.5,  metformin  is  not  expected  to  be  a  bio-accumulative 
substance. Using the default Fpen and the maximum daily dose to be given in humans of 2000 mg of 
metformin (corrected for molar mass of hydrochloride), a PECsurface water of 7.8 µg/L was calculated.  
In  conclusion  of  the  OECD  308  study,  metformin  dissipated  rapidly  from  the  water  phase  via 
adsorption  to  the  sediment.  Additionally,  metformin  rapidly  degraded  via  the  formation  of  several 
minor  or  transient  degradation  products  to  CO2.  On  the  basis  of  the  distribution  of  total  radioactivity 
between  the  water  phase  (overlying  plus  pore  water)  and  the  sediment  (extractable  and 
nonextractable), K d-values for sediment can be calculated for each sampling date. From day 1 to day 7, 
a period with little initial degradation and with levels of about 50% of the applied radioactivity in water 
and  around  50%  in  sediment,  Kd  values  of  in  maximum  7.2  (river)  and  6.9  (pond)  were  obtained. 
These are in line with the low values determined for soil in the adsorption test. 
The criterion for significant shifting to the sediment (10% of the substance at any time point after or at 
14 days is present in sediment) is exceeded for metformin. Therefore, effects on sediment organisms 
were considered in Tier B and a toxicity study on chironomids was conducted.

The  combination  of  the  glucose-dependent  insulin  secretagogue  linagliptin  with  the  insulin  sensitizing 
drug metformin is considered a good principle for diabetes therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. An 
additive effect on glucose reduction of linagliptin and metformin was shown in a mouse disease model 
for  diabetes  (diabetic  db/db  mice).  There  was  no  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between 
metformin and linagliptin. 
As  shown  in  the  linagliptin  non-clinical  development  program,  signs  of  linagliptin-related  toxicity 
occurred at doses far in excess of those recommended for therapy. In the 2-week and 13-week toxicity 
studies  in  the  rat,  the  liver,  kidneys,  thyroid,  lymphoid  organs  and  lungs  were  identified  as  target 
organs  of  toxicity.  In  the  2-week  rat  toxicity  study,  no  adverse  findings  were  seen  up  to  100 
mg/kg/day  (associated  with  an  AUC0-24h,ss  of  291  times  human  AUC0-24h,ss  at  the  MRHD  =  291x 
MRHD).  In  the  13-week  rat  toxicity  study  a  NOAEL  of  30  mg/kg/day  (95.6x  MRHD)  was  derived. 
Linagliptin was not teratogenic in rats up to and including a dosage of 240 mg/kg/day (943x MRHD).  
Metformin-related toxicity in the rat was observed in the heart, liver, kidneys, salivary glands, ovaries, 
thymus,  gastrointestinal  tract  (stomach,  small  and  large  intestine)  and  adrenal  glands  at  dosages 
associated  with  an  exposure  of  7.4x  MRHD  or  higher.  In  addition,  body  weight  gain  was  reduced.  A 
NOAEL  of  200  mg/kg/day  (2.4x  MRHD)  was  derived  in  the  2-week  rat  toxicity  study.  Metformin  was 
not  teratogenic  and  not  embryotoxic  in  the  rat  at  a  dosage  of  200  mg/kg/day  (4.0x  MRHD). 
Teratogenicity  of  metformin  in  the  rat  was  observed  at  500  mg/kg/day  (10.9x  MRHD,  beginning 
effects) and 1000 mg/kg/day (23.2x MRHD). At these dosages, blood glucose levels were affected and 
dysglycaemia and fetal morphological changes induced by metformin in the rat may be connected.  
In  all  linagliptin/metformin  toxicity  studies,  linagliptin  and  metformin  were  tested  in  clinical  relevant 
dose ratios of 1:200 and 1:400. In the general toxicity studies, the only observed interaction between 
linagliptin  and  metformin  was  a  reduction  of  body  weight  gain.  This  effect  is  considered  not  adverse 
but  rather  an  additive  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  the  two  antidiabetic  compounds.  In  the  13-week 
combination  toxicity  study  in  the  rat,  a  NOAEL  for  linagliptin/metformin  of  0.5/100  mg/kg/day  (1.0x 
MRHD for linagliptin, 1.4x MRHD for metformin) was derived based on metformin related findings. All 
adverse findings in the combination studies were attributed to metformin at dosages of 400 mg/kg/day 
(7.4x  MRHD)  or  higher  and  no  linagliptin  related  toxicity  was  observed.  There  was  no  indication  of  a 
teratogenic  effect  attributable  to  the  co-administration  of  linagliptin  and  metformin.  The  individual 
compounds were shown to be not genotoxic and not carcinogenic.

2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  developmental  plan  of  the  combination  linagliptin/metformin  was  limited  to 
necessary  studies.  This  is  considered  acceptable.  The  available  non-clinical  data  including  the  results 
obtained  from  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  and  reproduction  toxicity  studies  with  Jentadueto  and  the 
environmental risk assessment did not identify any new safety issues. The non-clinical safety profile of 
linagliptin/metformin  appears  to  be  consistent  with  those  established  for  linagliptin  and  metformin 
when used as monotherapy. Based on the available non-clinical safety data with the two monotherapy 
compounds, linagliptin and metformin, it is concluded that the FDC should be well tolerated when used 
in human at the proposed dosage.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
The  Applicant  is  seeking  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  linagliptin/metformin  film-coated  tablets  as  an 
adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients inadequately controlled on 
their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone, or those already being treated with the combination 
of linagliptin and metformin, also in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e. triple combination therapy) 
in patients inadequately controlled on their maximum tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
For  patients  switching  from  co-administration  of  linagliptin  and  metformin,  Jentadueto  should  be 
initiated at the dose of linagliptin and metformin already being taken. The recommended starting dose 
of  Jentadueto  for  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  dual  combination  therapy  with  the  maximal 
tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea is 2.5 mg of linagliptin twice daily (5 mg total daily 
dose)  and  a  dose  of  metformin  similar  to  the  dose  already  being  taken.  When  linagliptin  plus 
metformin  is  used  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea,  a  lower  dose  of  the  sulphonylurea  may  be 
required due to the risk of hypoglycaemia. For the different doses of metformin, Jentadueto is available 
in  strengths  of  2.5 mg  linagliptin  plus  850 mg  metformin  hydrochloride  and  2.5 mg  linagliptin  plus 
1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride.  
The clinical development program of Jentadueto was designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy 
of linagliptin, metformin and linagliptin/metformin as FDC in patients with T2DM. No dedicated studies 
with metformin as monotherapy were conducted. The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy profiles of 
metformin  as  monotherapy  are  well  known.  The  clinical  development  programs  for  linagliptin  and 
linagliptin/metformin are presented in table 14 and 15.. 
Scientific advice was provided by the CHMP in September 2008 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/ 472394/2008) on 
the  clinical  aspects  of  the  development  program.  The  CHMP  requested  a  clinical  study  to  show 
equivalence of twice daily dosing of linagliptin 2.5 mg with once daily dosing of linagliptin 5 mg. This 
study  was  subsequently  conducted  by  the  Applicant  and  its  results  are  presented  in  this  Marketing 
Authorisation application. The advice given has been followed in all essential parts.

2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics 
Although  this  application  concerns  a  fixed  dose  combination  (FDC)  tablet,  most  clinical  studies 
supporting  the  application  were  conducted  with  separate  tablets  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg  and  metformin 
(Glucophage  1000  mg,  500  mg  and  850  mg  tablets).  Therefore  the  Applicant  performed  three 
bioequivalence  studies  (1288.1,  1288.2  and  1288.3)  to  justify  the  extrapolation  of  the  results  of  the 
studies  conducted  with  the  mono  components  to  the  FDC  tablets.  Furthermore,  the  applicant 
conducted  one  bioequivalence  study  with  the  European  and  US  metformin  reference  products.  In 
addition,  study  1218.45  was  conducted  to  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics 
of  2.5  mg  linagliptin  twice  daily,  in  order  to  support  BID  dosing  of  linagliptin  in  combination  with 
metformin. 
Plasma and urine concentrations of linagliptin and its metabolite CD 1790 were measured using specific 
and highly sensitive HPLC-MS/MS methods. Plasma concentrations of metformin were measured using 
validated  liquid  chromatography  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  bioanalytical  methods. 
Analytical methods for linagliptin and metformin were well described and validated.  
Jentadueto 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 51/134
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
For  the  statistical  analysis  of  bioequivalence  studies  two  different  methods  were  used.  The  initial 
analysis included  all  subjects  who  had  been  dispensed  study  medication,  the  treated  set.  The  second 
analysis  was  a  sensitivity  analysis  using  a  per  protocol  set  for  evaluation  of  Bioequivalence  (PPS-BE 
set),  the  PPS-BE  set  complies  with  the  current  Guideline  on  the  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev1). In this document he ratio of the geometric means of T/R of the PPS-
BE set are presented.  
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
Linagliptin 
After  oral  administration  of  a  5  mg  dose,  linagliptin  is  rapidly  absorbed,  with  peak  plasma 
concentrations  occurring  1.5  to  2.5  hours  post  dose  (median  tmax),  suggesting  pre-dominant 
absorption  in  the  upper  intestine.  Linagliptin  has  an  oral  systemic  bioavailability  of  30%  and  a 
moderate  permeability.  Additionally,  linagliptin  is  a  highly  soluble  drug.  Therefore,  linagliptin  can  be 
considered a Class 3 drug substance  according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS). 
In  vitro  data  in  Caco-2  cells indicated  that  linagliptin is  a  substrate  for  P-gp.  After  once-daily  dosing, 
steady-state  plasma  concentrations  of  5  mg  linagliptin  are  reached  by  the  third  dose.  Plasma  AUC  of 
linagliptin  increased  approximately  33%  following  5  mg  doses  at  steady-state  compared  to  the  first 
dose 
Metformin 
The  absolute  bioavailability  o
f  a  metformin  500  -850  mg  tablet  given  under  fasting  conditions  is 
approximately 50% to 60
%.  
Linagliptin/metformin 
In study 1218.47 the relative oral bioavailability of a pilot scale fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet of 
linagliptin  2.5  mg/metformin  1000  mg,  was  compared  with  single  linagliptin  2.5  mg  and  metformin 
1000 mg tablets administered together to 20 healthy male and female subjects.  The pharmacokinetic 
properties of these pilot scale tablets wer
e similar to the properties of the single linagliptin and single 
metformin tablets given 
in combination.  
Bioequivale
nce 
Linagliptin 
Bioequivalence  of  2.5  mg  linagliptin  twice  daily  (bid)  and  5  mg  linagliptin  once  daily  (qd)  has  been 
established in study 1218.45. Sixteen healthy men and women were entered 
in the trial, one subject 
discontinued due to an AE and was completel
y excluded from the
 PK analysis.  
The primary endpoint in this study was AUC0-24,ss for linagliptin. The secondary endpoints were the PK 
of 
parameters  Cmax,ss,  C pre,  N,  AUC0-12,ss,  AE t1-t2,ss,  fet1-t2,ss,  tmax,ss,  CL/F,ss,  and  the  PD  parameters

min,ss  .  Safety  was  monitored 
  E
The extent of exposure over the 24-h interval at steady-state (AUC0-24,ss) was comparable between the 
5  mg  once  daily  and  2.5  mg  twice  daily  regimens  (132  vs.  124  nmol·h/L).  The  AUC0-24,ss  values 
generally  showed  a  low  interindividual  variability  with  geometric  coefficients  of  variat
ion  (gCV)  of 
14.2%  (2.5  mg  twice  daily)  and  18.0%  (5  mg  once  daily).  Median  tmax,ss  was  comparable  for  both 
dosage regimens and the morning dose and the evening dose of the twice daily regimen.

The  adjusted  gMean  T/R  ratio  of  AUC0-24,ss  was  93.89%  with  a  90%  CI  of  89.49-98.51%.  DPP-4 
inhibition was comparable for both dosage regimens over the whole 24-h interval at steady-state. The 
average DPP-4 inhibition was 85.3% for the 5 mg once daily regimen and 85.8% for the 2.5 mg twice 
daily regimen. The plasma concentration-time profiles of this study are presented in the figure below.

Metformin 
Clinical study 1218.46 was conducted with a metformin tablet from the US market. To allow bridging of 
the  results  of  this  study,  the  Applicant  conducted  bioequivalence  study  1218.57,  with  metformin 
tablets from the European and the US market. 
In this bioequivalence study, two different metformin tablets of two different strengths administered to 
56  (28  for  each  study  part)  healthy  male  and  female  subjects  in  an  open,  randomised,  single  dose, 
two-period crossover trial under fasting conditions design.

Linagliptin/metformin 
The  applicant  conducted  three  bioequivalence  studies  1288.1,1288.2  and  1288.3  with  the  three  
different linagliptin/metformin FDC tablet strengths. These three bioequivalence studies have a similar 
design (open-label, randomised, single dose, two-way crossover, trials in healthy volunteers).  
A  single  dose  of  the  test  product  (linagliptin/metformin  FDC  tablet)  or  reference  products  (linagliptin 
tablet  plus  metformin  tablet)  were  administered  after  an  overnight  fast  of  at  least  10  h,  in  each 
treatment period separated by a washout phase of at least 35 days. The blood samples were collected 
in each period as per the following times: pre-dose and at 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 1 , 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 
8, 12, 24, 34, 48 and 72 hours post dose in each of two periods.  
The  primary  endpoints  were  AUC0-72  and  C max  for  linagliptin  and  AUC 0-tz,  AUC 0-∞  and  C max  for 
metformin.  Secondary  endpoints  were  AUC0-∞  and  AUC0-tz  for  linagliptin  and  %AUC tz-,  AUC t1-t2,  tmax, 
λ z, t1/2, MRTpo, CL/F, Vz/F for both analytes. Safety was monitored descriptively.

Influence of food 
Linagliptin 
Intake  of  food  prolonged  the  time  to  reach  maximum  plasma  concentrations  by  2  hours  and  lowered 
the C max by 15%. No influence on the AUC0-72 was observed. The other pharmacokinetic parameters of 
linagliptin were comparable under fasted and fed conditions. Food has no clinical relevant influence on 
the pharmacokinetics of the linagliptin and linagliptin itself can be administered with and without food.  
Metformin 
Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, a 40% lower Cmax and a 
25%  lower  AUC  is  observed  when  given  with  food;  the  clinical  relevance  of  these  decreases  is 
unknown. Metformin can be administered with and without food. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
The  Applicant  conducted  study  1288.4  to  investigate  the  effect  of  food  on  the  PK  of  linagliptin/ 
metformin  FDC  tablet.  A  single  dose  of  a  FDC  tablet  with  linagliptin  2.5  mg  and  metformin  1000  mg 
was  administered  to  32  healthy  volunteers  after  an  overnight  fast  (Reference)  and  after  a  high  fat, 
high caloric meal (Test) with a wash out period of at least 35 days. The AUC0-72 and C max for linagliptin 
and AUC 0-∞ and C max for metformin were evaluated as primary endpoints. The results of the study are 
summarised in table below.

Administration  of  2.5  mg  linagliptin  and  1000  mg  metformin  as  FDC  tablet  after  food  intake  had  no 
relevant  effect  on  the  relative  bioavailability  of  linagliptin  with  regard  to  AUC 0-72  and  C max.  The 
exposure to metformin was similar under fed and fasted conditions with regard to AUC0-∞ and AUC 0-tz, 
while C max was reduced. This reduction is smaller than reported in the literature for metformin... Food 
is not expected to have a relevant influence on the efficacy of the linagliptin and metformin FDC tablet.

Distribution 
Linagliptin 
Plasma  protein  binding  of  linagliptin  in  human  plasma  is  concentration-dependent,  decreasing  from 
99%  at  1  nM  to  83%  at  20  nM.  Consequently  the  protein  unbound  fraction  of  linagliptin  in  plasma 
increases  with  increasing  total  plasma  concentrations.  This  is  probably  reflecting  the  saturation  of 
binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentrations of linagliptin. As a result, linagliptin shows non-linear 
distribution kinetics both after oral and intravenous administration. After single oral administration of 5 
mg linagliptin the apparent volume of distribution, Vz/F was approximately 12700 L.  
Metformin 
Metformin protein binding in plasma is negligible, metformin partitions into erythrocytes. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  linagliptin/metformin  FDC  which  is  considered 
acceptable.  
Elimination 
Excretion 
Linagliptin 
Plasma  concentrations  of  linagliptin  decline  in  a  triphasic  manner  with  a  long  terminal  half-life 
(terminal  half-life  for  linagliptin  more  than  100  hours),  that  is  mostly  related  to  the  saturable,  tight 
binding of linagliptin to DPP-4 and does not contribute to the accumulation of linagliptin. The effective 
half-life  for  accumulation  of  linagliptin,  as  determined  from  oral  administration  of  multiple  doses  of  5 
mg  linagliptin,  is  approximately  12  hours.  Plasma  AUC  of  linagliptin  increased  in  a  less  than  dose-
proportional manner. 
Following administration of an oral [14C] linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of the 
administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. Renal 
clearance at steady state was approximately 70 mL/min.  
Metformin 
Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 
hours. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  linagliptin/metformin  FDC  which  is  considered 
acceptable.

Metabolism 
Linagliptin 
Most  of  the  parent  compound  was  excreted  unchanged  in  urine  and  faeces  with  76%  (61%  out  of 
81%) of excreted radioactivity after intravenous dosing and with 90% (78% out of 87%) of excreted 
radioactivity  after  oral  dosing.  In  vitro  studies  indicated  that  linagliptin  is  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  to 
form  its  major  metabolite  CD1790.  All  metabolites  contributed  to  less  than  10  %  of  the  excreted 
radioactivity.  A  total  of  the  seven  metabolites  were  identified,  only  two  were  formed  at  quantifiable 
amount,  namely  oxidation  in  the  quinazoline  moiety  and  CD1790.  In  plasma  16.9%  of  sample 
radioactivity in pooled samples after oral administration was identified as CD1790. 
Metformin 
Metformin does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans). 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  for  the  FDC  linagliptin/metformin  which  is  considered 
acceptable. 
Special populations 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Linagliptin 
The PK of linagliptin after single and multiple rising oral doses of 1 mg to 10 mg and 2.5 mg to 10 mg 
linagliptin  were  evaluated  in  T2DM  patients  using  a  non-compartmental  approach  in  studies  1218.2, 
1218.3  (Caucasian  patients), in  study 1218.12  (Japanese  patients), in  study 1218.26  (T2DM  patients 
with  normal  and  impaired  renal  function,),  and  in  study  1218.55  (Black  patients).  The  PK  of  patients 
with T2DM were also evaluated by a Pop-PK analysis using rich sampling data from trials 1218.2 and 
1218.3  as  well  as  sparse  sampling  data  from  the  phase  IIb  studies  1218.5  and  1218.6.  The 
pharmacokinetics  of  linagliptin  was  generally  similar  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  patients  with  type  2 
diabetes.  
Metformin 
No additional studies have been conducted for metformin which is considered acceptable. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No  additional  studies  in  special  populations  have  been  conducted  for  the  linagliptin/metformin  FDC 
tablets. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Renal impairment 
Linagliptin 
The  influence  of  renal  impairment  is  only  moderate  for  the  parent  compound  as  well  as  for  the  main 
metabolite. The increase in exposure in severe renal impairment is less than 2 -fold and the exposure 
in  T2DM  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  is  comparable  with  “healthy”  impaired  patients.  No 
dose adjustment is considered necessary in these patients. 
Jentadueto 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 59/134
 
 
 
 
Metformin 
In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and 
the  renal  clearance  is  decreased  in  proportion  to  the  decrease  in  creatinine  clearance.  Metformin  is 
therefore  contraindicated  in  patients  with  a  creatinine  clearance  <  60  ml/min  and  the  creatinine 
clearance should be determined before initiating treatment and regularly thereafter. 
Linagliptin/meftormin 
Jentadueto  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine 
clearance < 60 ml/min) due to the metformin component. As metformin hydrochloride is excreted by 
the  kidney,  serum  creatinine  levels  should  be  determined  before  initiating  treatment  and  regularly 
thereafter.  
Hepatic impairment 
Linagliptin 
In  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  insufficiency  (according  to  the  Child-Pugh 
classification),  mean  AUC  and  C max  of  linagliptin  were  similar  to  healthy  matched  controls  following 
administration  of  multiple  5  mg  doses  of  linagliptin.  The  exposure  to  the  main  metabolite  is 
significantly  reduced,  however  the  elimination  of  linagliptin  by  metabolism  is  small  (less  than  13%). 
Although  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  indicated  that  the  exposure  to  linagliptin  is  not  affected  by 
hepatic impairment, clinical experience with linagliptin in patients with hepatic insufficiently is lacking. 
Metformin 
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Impaired hepatic function has been 
associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
Jentadueto is not recommended in patients with hepatic insufficiency due to both components and this 
is reflected in the SmPC.  
Gender and race 
Linagliptin 
Gender  had  no  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  linagliptin  based  on  a  population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data. The difference in exposure was not more than 
9% higher in female than in male subjects. No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. 
Race had no obvious effect on the plasma concentrations of linagliptin based on a composite analysis 
of available pharmacokinetic data, including patients of Caucasian, Hispanic, African, and Asian origin. 
In  addition  the  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  linagliptin  were  found  to  be  similar  in  dedicated 
phase  I  studies  in  Japanese,  Chinese  and  Caucasian  healthy  volunteers.  No  dosage  adjustment  is 
necessary based on race.  
Metformin 
Although  dedicated  studies  on  the  influence  of  gender  or  race  are  not  available,  there  are  no 
indications that the pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of metformin are substantially influenced by 
these factors.

Linagliptin/metformin 
No additional studies have been conducted for the linagliptin/metformin FDC tablets. This is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
Weight 
Linagliptin 
The  influence  of  weight  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  linagliptin  was  less  than  20%  and  therefore  not 
clinically relevant effect. No dosage adjustment is necessary based on BMI. 
Metformin 
No additional studies have been conducted with metformin. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No additional studies have been conducted for the linagliptin/metformin FDC tablets. This is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP.  
Elderly population 
Linagliptin 
No dosage adjustment is required based on age, as age did not have a clinically relevant impact on the 
pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II 
data.  Elderly  subjects  (65  to  80)  had  comparable  plasma  concentrations  of  linagliptin  compared  to 
younger subjects.  
Metformin 
Due to the potential for decreased renal function in elderly subjects, the metformin dosage should be 
adjusted based on renal function. Regular assessment of renal function is necessary. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
As  metformin  is  excreted  by  the  kidney,  Jentadueto  should  be  used  with  caution  as  age  increases. 
Monitoring  of  renal  function  is  necessary  to  aid  in  prevention  of  metformin-associated  lactic  acidosis, 
particularly  in  the  elderly.  Clinical  experience  with  patients  > 80  years  of  age  is  limited  and  caution 
should be exercised when treating this population. 
Paediatric population 
Linagliptin 
Studies  characterizing  the  pharmacokinetics  of  linagliptin  in  paediatric  patients  have  not  yet  been 
performed. 
Metformin 
Metformin  is  indicated  in  children  from  10  years  of  age  and  adolescents,  and  may  be  used  as 
monotherapy or in combination with insulin. The usual starting dose is 500 mg or 850 mg metformin 
hydrochloride  once  daily,  given  during  meals  or  after  meals.  The  diagnosis  of  T2DM  should  be 
confirmed before treatment with metformin hydrochloride is initiated. 
Jentadueto 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 61/134
 
 
 
 
No  effect  of  metformin  hydrochloride  on  growth  and  puberty  has  been  detected  during  controlled 
clinical  studies  of  one-year  duration  but  no  long-term  data  on  these  specific  points  are  available.  
Therefore,  a  careful  follow-up  of  the  effect  of  metformin  hydrochloride  on  these  parameters  in 
metformin hydrochloride-treated children, especially pre-pubescent children, is recommended. Only 15 
subjects  aged  between  10  and  12  years  were  included  in  the  controlled  clinical  studies  conducted  in 
children and adolescents. Although efficacy and safety of metformin hydrochloride in these children did 
not differ from efficacy and safety in older children and adolescents, particular caution is recommended 
when prescribing to children aged between 10 and 12 years. 
After  single  doses  of  metformin  hydrochloride  500  mg,  paediatric  patients  have  shown  similar 
phamacokinetic  profile  to  that  observed  in  healthy  adults.  The  data  on  the  use  of  multiple  doses  of 
metformin  are  restricted  to  one  study.  After  repeated  doses  of  500  mg  twice  daily  for  7  days  in 
paediatric patients the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC0-t) were reduced 
by  approximately  33%  and  40%,  respectively  compared  to  diabetic  adults  who  received  repeated 
doses  of  500  mg  twice  daily  for  14  days.  As  the  dose  is  individually  titrated  based  on  glycaemic 
control, this is of limited clinical relevance. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
No paediatric studies have been conducted for the linagliptin/metformin FDC tablets.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Linagliptin 
In  vitro  data  indicate  that  linagliptin  is  a  substrate  for  CYP3A4  and  P-gp,  OATP8-,  OCT2-,  OAT4-, 
OCTN1- and OCTN2.  
No relevant inhibition of CYPs or transporter proteins at clinically plausible concentrations of linagliptin 
or its major metabolite CD 1790 was found. Linagliptin is a competitive inhibitor of MAO-B and a weak 
inhibitor  of  CYP3A4/3A5  but  clinical  relevance  of  the  MAO-B  and  CYP3A4/3A5  inhibition  is  considered 
unlikely.  Furthermore,  no  hints  on  enzyme  induction  (CYP  1A2,  2B6  and  3A4)  were  found  in  human 
hepatocytes. 
Based on the in vitro data, the effects of ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) and the effects 
of rifampicin (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer) on linagliptin pharmacokinetics as well as the effects 
of linagliptin on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (a sensitive P-gp substrate) and simvastatin (sensitive 
CYP3A4  substrate)  were  investigated.  Co-administration  with  ritonavir  led  to  a  two  fold  increase  in 
exposure (AUC) and multiple co-administration of linagliptin with rifampicin resulted in an about 40% 
decreased  linagliptin  steady-state  AUC  presumably  by  increasing/decreasing  the  bioavailability  of 
linagliptin  by  inhibition/induction  of  P-glycoprotein.  Linagliptin  did  not  have  a  clinically  relevant  effect 
on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin or digoxine.  
In  addition  to  in  vitro  data  based  studies  also  common  co-medications  of  T2DM  patients  were 
investigated. This included DDI studies with several antidiabetic agents. Linagliptin’s pharmacokinetics 
were  not  affected  to  a  clinical  relevant  degree  by  co-administration  of  glyburide,  metformin  and 
pioglitazone  and  linagliptin  did  not  have  a  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
glyburide , metformin and pioglitazone.  
Co-administration with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) and a combination product of ethinylestradiol and 
levonorgestrel  was  also  evaluated.  Linagliptin  did  not  have  a  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of warfarin and oral contraceptives.

Metformin 
Drug  interactions  of  metformin  were  reported  for  glyburide,  furosemide,  nifedipine,  and  are  likely  for 
cationic  drugs  that  are  eliminated  by  renal  tubular  secretion  (e.g.  amiloride,  cimetidine,  digoxin, 
morphine,  procainamide,  quinidine,  quinine,  ranitidine,  triamterene,  trimethoprim,  or  vancomycin). 
Certain  drugs  tend  to  produce  hyperglycaemia  and  may  cause loss  of  glycaemic  control. These  drugs 
include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, 
oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium-channel-blocking drugs, and 
isoniazid.  In  healthy  volunteers,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  metformin  and  propranolol,  and  metformin 
and ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose interaction studies. Metformin is 
negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound 
drugs  such  as  salicylates,  sulfonamides,  chloramphenicol,  and  probenecid,  as  compared  to  the 
sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.  
Linagliptin/metformin 
In  study  1218.4,  the  bioavailability  of  linagliptin  and  of  metformin  after  concomitant  multiple  oral 
administration of 10 mg linagliptin tablets and 3 x 850 mg metformin in comparison to linagliptin and 
metformin given alone was investigated.

Co-administration of multiple TID doses of 850 mg metformin with 10 mg linagliptin once daily resulted 
in a 20% increase of linagliptin steady-state AUC, but did not affect linagliptin Cmax. These results are 
in  line  with  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  where  an  equal  19.8%  increase  in  linagliptin 
exposure  in  combination  with  metformin  was  found.  The  increase  is  considered  not  clinically 
meaningful.  Linagliptin  co-administration  had  no  clinical  meaningful  effect  on  metformin  exposure. 
Steady-state AUC and Cmax of metformin were unchanged during linagliptin co-administration. 
The interaction potential of linagliptin and metformin has been sufficiently characterised for both drugs 
individually. Linagliptin does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin 
or vice versa.

2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Linagliptin 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  linagliptin  is  DPP-4  inhibition.  Nutrient  intake  stimulates  the  secretion  of 
the  gastrointestinal  incretin  hormones,  glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1)  and  glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic  polypeptide  (GIP),  both  of  which  exert  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  effects  and 
assist pancreatic insulin and glucagon in maintaining glucose homeostasis.  GLP-1 lowers blood glucose 
levels  by  augmenting  the  glucose-stimulated  insulin  release.  Moreover,  GLP-1  inhibits  glucagon 
secretion, slows gastric emptying, and induces satiety. The plasma half-life of GLP-1 is limited to a few 
minutes  because  of  rapid  proteolytic  degradation  by  the  enzyme  DPP-4.  Inhibition  of  DPP-4  prolongs 
the  half-life  of  active  GLP-1  and  thereby  increases  plasma  insulin  levels  and  lowers  plasma  glucose 
levels. Since GLP-1 activity ceases when the glucose concentration falls below 55 mg/dL, prolongation 
of the half-life of GLP-1 by DPP-4 inhibitors bears little risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Metformin 
The principal metabolic effects of metformin consist of a decrease of hepatic glucose production/output 
and  improvement  of  insulin-mediated  glucose  utilisation  (i.e.  increased  insulin  sensitivity),  thereby 
targeting  two  of  the  primary  metabolic  defects  contributing  to  both  fasting  and  postprandial 
hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM. 
This implies that  with  metformin  treatment, insulin  secretion is not  directly affected,  although  fasting 
insulin  levels  decrease  as  a  result  of  improved  insulin  sensitivity.  Through  these  mechanisms, 
metformin  therapy  typically  leads  to  substantial  reductions  in  glycosylated  HbA1c,  but  it  does  not 
promote weight gain or increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Linagliptin 
Inhibition  of DPP-4  was  considered  the  most  relevant  biomarker  for  the  effectiveness  of  linagliptin.  A 
median  DPP-4  inhibition  of  80%  at  trough  was  assumed  as  a  threshold  based  on  published  data. 
Plasma  glucose  and  active  GLP-1  were  other  markers  for  effectiveness.  Exploratory  biomarkers 
included  glucagon,  C-peptide,  insulin,  fructosamine,  1,5-Anhydroglucitol  and  glycated  haemoglobin 
(HbA1c). 
DPP-4 inhibition 
Linagliptin treatment resulted in a rapid, potent and long-lasting inhibition of plasma DPP-4 in clinical 
studies.  Already  after  a  single  dose  of  linagliptin,  DPP-4  was  effectively  inhibited  as  shown  by 
maximum  DPP-4  inhibitions  of  72%  and  88.5%  for  2.5  and  5  mg,  and  >95%  for  doses  ≥25  mg.  At 
steady-state, plasma DPP-4 activity was inhibited over 24 h by >80% in most patients receiving 5 mg 
or  10  mg  linagliptin  once  daily  but  not  in  patients  receiving  2.5  mg  linagliptin  or  lower  doses.  A 
consistent  DPP-4  inhibition  more  than  80%  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  interval  (i.e.  trough)  with  5  mg 
linagliptin q.d. was also seen in Japanese T2DM patients, as well as in Caucasian and Japanese healthy 
adult subjects.

Plasma Glucose and GLP-1 
The  effects  of  linagliptin  on  incretin  and  glucose  concentrations  in  T2DM  patients  were  investigated 
during  meal  (MTT)  and  oral  glucose  tolerance  tests  (OGTT).  Treatment  with  5  mg  linagliptin  over  28 
days  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  increase  of  active  glucagon  like  peptide  1  (GLP-1) 
concentrations  of  18.1  pmol*h  /L  (p<0.0001)  after  a  MTT  compared  to  placebo  and  a  statistically 
significant  reduction  of  weighted  mean  daily  glucose  and  postprandial  plasma  glucose  AUEC0-3h  of 
−19.9  mg/dL  (p<0.0001)  and  −106.5  mg*h/dL  (p<0.0001),  respectively.  Linagliptin  dosing  for  28 
days  also  resulted  in  a  relevant  decrease  in  fasting  plasma  glucose  concentrations  of  −10.8  mg/dL 
compared to placebo. 
Short term biomarkers 
As  expected  from  the  mechanism  of  action,  multiple  administration  of  linagliptin  resulted  in  a 
significant  increase  in  ß-cell  indices  based  on  fasting  and  postprandial  insulin  and  C-peptide 
concentrations. 
Treatment  with  5  mg  linagliptin  caused  an  increase  in  insulin  secretion,  as  evidenced  by:  a  placebo-
adjusted  insulin  secretion  change  (HOMA-%B)  from  baseline  of  24.2;  and  a  statistically  significant 
placebo  corrected  change  from  baseline  in  insulin  secretion  rate  (ISR)  to  glucose  ratio  of  28.7 
pM/(mg/dL·h)(p=0.0004) after 28 days of treatment. Also peak glucagon concentrations after 4 week 
linagliptin  treatment  were  reduced  by  −16.8  pg/mL  (95%  CI:  −28.7,  −4.9;  p=0.0064)  compared  to 
placebo. 
Intermediate term biomarkers 
Fructosamine  and  1,5-Anhydroglucitol  were  measured  during  linagliptin  development  as  intermediate 
term  markers  of  glucose  control,  reflecting  glucose  control  over  a  period  of  two  to  three  weeks. 
Fructosamine  is  formed  by  the  reaction  of  the  carbonyl  group  of  glucose  with  an  amino  group  of  a 
protein,  whereas  1,5-Anhydroglucitol  is  a  naturally  occurring  monosaccharide  contained  in  nearly  all 
foods,  which  is  found  in a  relatively  constant  amount  in  the  blood  and  tissues.  1,5-Anhydroglucitol  is 
filtered  in  the  kidney,  but  nearly  completely  re-absorbed  by  a  glucose  transporter.  Thus  glucose  and 
1,5-Anhydroglucitol  compete  for  reabsorption  during  periods  of  high  glucose  concentrations  (>180 
mg/dL)  and  consequently  1,5-Anhydroglucitol  blood  concentrations  decrease  during  times  of 
hyperglycaemia above 180 mg/dL). 
The  observed  effect  on  glucose  control  also  translated  in  an  effect  on  intermediate  term  markers  of 
glucose control, fructosamine and 1,5-Anhydroglucitol. As fructosamine was generally more variable in 
linagliptin trials, 1,5-Anhydroglucitol is assumed to be a better marker for intermediate glucose control. 
Treatment  with  5  mg  linagliptin  over  4  weeks  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  increase  of  1,5-
Anhydroglucitol  concentrations  of  1.8  μg/mL  (p<0.0001)  compared  to  placebo  (1.0  μg/mL  vs.  -0.8 
μg/mL)  and  thus  indicate  that  glucose  excursions  during  linagliptin  treatment  are  substantially 
reduced.  The  concentration  of  10  μg/mL  at  week  4  also  indicates  that  nearly  no  glucose  excursions 
above 180 mg/dL occurred, as this was found to be the reference value in optimally controlled patients 
with T2DM.

Long term biomarkers 
HbA1c  was  measured  in  3  early  trials  with  4  week  treatment  duration.  Despite  the  short  term 
treatment  period,  which  does  not  allow  HbA1c  to  reach  a  new  equilibrium  to  display  maximum 
treatment effects, dosing of linagliptin generally resulted in statistically significant decreases in HbA1c 
of  up  to  -0.48%  compared  to  placebo.  The  observed  effects  were  similar  in  Caucasian  and  Japanese 
T2DM  patients.  HbA1c  was  the  primary  efficacy  parameter  used  in  the  studies  of  >4  weeks  duration 
and thus also for the pivotal studies. In these studies consistent clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c 
compared to placebo. 
A thorough QT study was performed  to demonstrate that linagliptin does not lead to QT prolongation 
compared  to  placebo  (study  1218.32).  The  primary  analysis  demonstrated  that,  compared  with 
placebo, the mean changes in the QTcI interval over 1 to 4 hours were −1.1 ms for the 5 mg dose and 
−2.5  ms  for  the  100  mg  dose  of  linagliptin.  The  upper  bound  of  the  two-sided  90%  confidence 
intervals was 0.5 ms for 5 mg linagliptin and −0.9 ms for 100 mg linagliptin. This was well below the 
predefined  non-inferiority  margin  of  10  ms,  indicating  there  was  no  clinically  relevant  increase  in  the 
QTcI interval following administration of 5 mg and 100 mg linagliptin compared with placebo. Similar 
results  were  obtained  for  the  secondary  endpoints.  Assay  sensitivity  was  demonstrated  by  the 
comparison of the mean QTcI interval changes from baseline over 1 to 4 hours between moxifloxacin 
(single administration of 400 mg) and placebo. 
Metformin 
Effects on Hepatic Glucose Production and Glycogenolysis 
The  predominant  glucose-lowering  mechanism  of  action  of  metformin  is  to  reduce  excessive  rates  of 
hepatic  glucose  production.  Metformin  inhibits  gluconeogenesis  by  increasing  hepatic  sensitivity  to 
insulin  and  decreasing  the  hepatic  extraction  of  certain  gluconeogenic  substrates  (e.g.  lactate). 
Metformin reduces gluconeogenesis by 0.6 mg/kg per minute, in effect leading to a 75% reduction in 
hepatic glucose output. It is believed that this effect is achieved through metformin induced activation 
of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, an energy regulating enzyme expressed in the 
liver. Hepatic glycogenolysis is also decreased by metformin. 
Effects on Peripheral Insulin Sensitivity 
The  extrahepatic  actions  of  metformin  include  improved  glucose  transport  and  utilisation  by  skeletal 
muscle due to improvements in non-oxidative glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis. These actions 
result  in  an  enhanced  insulin-stimulated  glucose  uptake  in  the  skeletal  muscle.  This  involves  an 
increase  in  the  movement  of  insulin-sensitive  glucose  transporter  molecules  to  the  cell  membrane. 
Additional  pharmacologic  actions  of  metformin  include  increased  glucose  oxidation  and  storage  in 
glycogen  and  fat,  and  inhibition  of  fatty  acid  oxidation.  Taken  together,  metformin  acts  as  an  insulin 
sensitizer without exerting any direct effect on pancreatic β-cell insulin secretion. 
Effects on the Rate of Intestinal Glucose Absorption 
The  rate  of  intestinal  glucose  absorption  is  also  reduced  with  metformin,  further  contributing  to  its 
blood glucose–lowering effects.

Effects on the GLP-1 
In a small study in obese non-diabetic male patients it was shown that a 14-day high-dose treatment 
(i.e.  2.550  mg/day)  with  metformin  was  associated  with  a  significant  increase  in  circulating  GLP-1 
plasma  levels  after  an  oral  glucose  load  [R10-5241,  Module  2.7.5].  As  subjects  were  studied  during 
euglycaemic  hyperinsulinaemic  clamp  conditions,  the  results  of  this  study  indicate  that  metformin 
determines a relevant elevation of oral glucose–stimulated GLP-1, which is not dependent on variations 
in  circulating  insulin  or  glucose.  The  mechanism  for  the  observed  increase  in  oral  glucose  stimulated 
GLP-1  levels  determined  by  metformin  treatment  could  have  been  principally  due  to  either  a 
stimulation of secretion or an inhibition of peptide inactivation, and was matter of debate over the last 
decade. The results of this study were confirmed by a recent study in healthy non-diabetic subjects, in 
whom  a  2-day  treatment  with  1.000  mg  metformin/day  increased  postprandial  total  GLP-1  plasma 
concentrations (4-h weighted mean) by about ~1.8-fold relative to placebo. It was also shown by the 
authors that metformin did not inhibit plasma DPP-4 activity either in vitro or in vivo. Based on these 
data  it  was  concluded  that  metformin  is  not  a  DPP-4  inhibitor  but  rather  enhances  precursor  GCG 
expression  in  the  large  intestine,  thereby  increasing  total  GLP-1  plasma  concentrations,  possibly  by 
enhancing GLP-1 secretion from enteroendocrine L-cells. 
Other Pharmacologic and Metabolic Effects 
In  addition  to  metformin’s  ability  to  lower  blood  glucose  concentrations,  it  has  been  shown  to  exert 
beneficial  effects  on  dyslipidemia,  hypofibrinolysis,  and  obesity  in  patients  with  T2DM.  Metformin  has 
been  reported  to  produce  10%  to  20%  reductions  in  plasma  TG  levels  in  nonhypertriglyceridemic 
patients  and  up  to  50%  TG  reductions  in  hypertriglyceridemic  patients  due  to  decreased  hepatic 
synthesis of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Total cholesterol (TC) levels have been reported 
to decrease a mean of 10%, with increases in HDL-C levels of up to 17% and decreases in LDL-C levels 
of up to 25%. Free fatty acid (FFA) levels have also been reported to decrease with metformin therapy. 
In  contrast  to  patients  receiving  sulfonylurea  therapy  for  diabetes,  those  who  receive  metformin 
generally maintain or loose body weight, with loss of adipose tissue accounting for most of the weight 
loss.  Metformin  therapy  is  associated  with  a  5%  net  difference  in  weight  reduction  compared  with 
sulfonylurea therapy. 
Effects on Plasma Glucose and HbA1c Levels 
A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluated metformin’s efficacy in achieving glycaemic 
control,  as  well  as  its  effects  on  body  weight.  In  10  placebo-controlled  studies  (with  treatment 
durations  ranging  between  1  to  36  months),  metformin  monotherapy  reduced  fasting  blood  glucose 
(FBG) concentrations by 2.0 mM compared with placebo (95% CI, –2.4 to –1.7) and HbA1c values by 
0.9 percentage points (95% CI, –1.1 to –0.7). In 9 studies comparing metformin and a sulfonylurea, 
both agents lowered blood glucose concentrations and HbA1c values equally. 
Linagliptin/metformin 
Linagliptin  in  combination  with  metformin  represents  a  pharmacologically  meaningful  therapeutic 
combination  approach,  because  different  pathophysiological  features  of  T2DM  (e.g.  impaired  ß-cell 
function,  increased  hepatic  glucose  output/gluconeogenesis,  and  peripheral  insulin  resistance)  are 
addressed by the complementary modes of action of both moieties. 
This principle pharmacological consideration is supported by consistent clinical evidence demonstrating 
that novel GLP-1 based therapies display additive glucose/HbA1c lowering effects in combination with 
metformin. This was shown to apply to both pharmacological approaches, i.e. the strategy of activating 
the  GLP-1  receptors  by  exenatide  or  liraglutide,  and  by  the  strategy  of  preventing  the  inactivation  of 
endogenous GLP-1 by inhibiting DPP-4.

Regarding  the  primary  PD  variable  DPP-4  inhibition  it  was  shown  by  a  7-day  repeat-dose  study  in 
healthy adult subjects that the linagliptin 5 mg q.d. and 2.5 mg b.i.d. treatment regimens resulted in a 
comparable  PD  response  as  shown  by  a  median  DPP-4  inhibition  of  about  80%  at  trough.  Moreover 
DPP-4 inhibition was comparable for both dosage regimens over the entire 24-h (i.e. 24-h for q.d. and 
2  x  12-h  for  b.i.d.  regimen)  dosing  interval  at  steady-state.  The  mean  average  DPP-4  inhibition  was 
85.3% and 85.8% for the 5 mg q.d. and the 2.5 mg b.i.d. regimens, respectively (study 1218.45). 
These findings were confirmed for HbA1c in study 1218.62. This study was a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled,  3  parallel  group  efficacy  and  safety  study  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg  b.i.d.  versus  5  mg 
q.d. over 12 weeks as add-on therapy to a b.i.d. dose regimen of metformin in patients with T2DM and 
insufficient glycaemic control. According to the pre-specified criterion in the protocol, non-inferiority of 
linagliptin 2.5 mg b.i.d. treatment was established versus linagliptin 5 mg q.d treatment. The adjusted 
mean treatment difference in HbA1c from baseline to Week 12 with linagliptin 2.5 mg b.i.d. compared 
to linagliptin 5 mg q.d. was 0.06% (95% CI -0.07, 0.19). 
2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  linagliptin  were  studied  in  29  Phase  I/II  trials, 
involving healthy subjects, patients with T2DM, and special populations (renal or hepatic impairment, 
Japanese subjects). DPP-4 inhibition was considered the primary pharmacodynamic parameter, with an 
inhibition of 80% or more over 24 hours related to maximum effects in incretin response and glucose 
reduction.  
Extrapolation  of  the  pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic  data  of  the linagliptin  5  mg tablet  to  the 
2.5 mg is justified by study 1218.45, in which it was shown that a dosage regimen of linagliptin 2.5 mg 
twice  daily  can  be  considered  bioequivalent  with  linagliptin  5  mg  once  daily,  based  on  the  exposure 
data  over  24  hours  AUC0-24  hours.  In  this  study  DPP-4  inhibition  >80%  over  24h  was  achieved  with 
multiple  dosing  of  2.5  mg  linagliptin.  In  healthy  individuals,  linagliptin  2.5  mg  twice  daily  was 
bioequivalent to linagliptin 5 mg once daily. 
The  applicant  conducted  three  bioequivalence  studies.  Based  on  these  studies  the  to  be  registered 
linagliptin  2.5  mg/metformin  1000  mg,  linagliptin  2.5  mg/metformin  850  mg,  linagliptin  2.5 
mg/metformin  500  mg  FDC  tablets  can  be  considered  bioequivalent  with  the  single  dose  formulation 
with linagliptin 2.5 mg tablet and metformin 1000 mg, 500 mg and 850 mg respectively.  
Results on secondary parameters such as active GLP-1, glucose, insulin and glucagon were consistent 
with  the  primary  parameter.  In  general,  linagliptin  plasma  concentrations  correlated  well  with  DPP-4 
activity/inhibition.  Although  age  has  been  investigated  as  covariate,  the  number  of  elderly  subjects 
>75 in all clinical studies was small, and pharmacodynamics has not been studied in elderly patients. 
In a thorough QT study, single doses of 5 mg or 100 mg linagliptin did not prolong QT interval of the 
ECG.  
2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Bioequivalence of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily with linagliptin 5 mg once daily has been appropriately 
demonstrated.  In  addition  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  linagliptin  2.5  mg/metformin  1000  mg, 
linagliptin  2.5  mg/metformin  850  mg  and  linagliptin  2.5  mg/metformin  500  mg  FDC  tablets  are 
bioequivalent with the linagliptin 2.5 mg tablet given concomitantly with metformin 1000 mg, 850 mg 
and 500 mg respectively.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1. Dose response studies 
Linagliptin 
The  optimum  daily  linagliptin  dose  of  5  mg  was  determined  in  the  linagliptin  mono  development 
programme  and  was  primarily  based  on  HbA1c  reduction  and  DPP-4  inhibition  in  the  2  dose-finding 
trials 1218.5 and 1218.6. Tolerability was excellent on all dose levels tested in these 2 trials (0.5 mg, 1 
mg,  2.5 mg, 5 mg,  and  10  mg),  and no  dose-dependent  increase  in  adverse  events  was  observed.  A 
median DPP-4 inhibition of at least 80% was only reached with the 5 mg and 10 mg linagliptin doses, 
but  not  with  lower  doses.  The  10  mg  dose  did  not  result  in  a  substantially  greater  median  DPP-4 
inhibition or HbA 1c reduction than the 5 mg dose, and hence, the 5 mg dose was used in phase III. In 
the entire phase III program, linagliptin 5 mg once daily was shown to provide consistent and clinically 
meaningful  improvements  in  glycaemic  control,  as  assessed  by  HbA 1c,  FPG,  or  postprandial  glucose 
levels.  Together  with  the  favourable  safety  profile  observed,  the  risk-benefit  ratio  of  linagliptin  is 
considered optimal for a daily dose of 5 mg linagliptin. 
Because the pharmacokinetics of metformin require an at least twice daily dosing, for the development 
of  the  FDC  the  once  daily  dosing  of  5  mg  linagliptin  was  split  into  2  daily  doses  of  2.5  mg.  In  trial 
1218.45,  a  phase  I-study  comparing  once  daily  and  twice  daily  dosing  in  healthy  subjects,  the  2 
linagliptin  dosing  regimens  were  shown  to  be  bioequivalent  in  regard  to  AUC  at  steady  state.  The 
average DPP-4 inhibition was 85.3% for the 5 mg once daily regimen and 85.8% for the 2.5 mg twice 
daily  regimen.  The  clinical  equivalence  of  both  posologies  was  demonstrated  in  a  large,  placebo-
controlled,  12-week  trial  1218.62  that  investigated  linagliptin  2.5  mg  bid  +  metformin  versus 
linagliptin 5 mg qd + metformin. 
Metformin 
Metformin  in  immediate  release  formulation  is  approved  as  tablet  for  oral  administration  in  the  dose 
strengths of 500 mg, 850 mg, and 1000 mg. In case of tolerability issues, the metformin dose should 
be  reduced.  is  the  Applicant  therefore  proposed  to  provide  FDC  tablets  with  linagliptin  and  all  3 
metformin  dose  strengths  to  offer  patients  maximal  flexibility  in  attaining  their  individual  daily 
metformin dose.  
For the key trials in this submission (1218.17, 1218.20, 1218.62, and 1218.18) the protocols specified 
that  the  daily  metformin  dose  should  be  1500  mg  or  above.  The  actual  unit  dose  strength  and  the 
actual  posology  was  at  the  investigator’s  discretion  and  depending  on  the  patient’s  need  and 
tolerability of metformin. The majority of patients in the 4 studies received a daily dose of 1500 mg to 
2000  mg  metformin  at  baseline;  a  considerable  proportion  of  patients  took  less  than  1500 mg 
metformin  per  day  (range  6.3%  to  8.6%).  In  trial  1218.46,  two  treatment  groups  with  metformin 
mono therapy of 500 mg bid and 1000 mg bid were evaluated.

Linagliptin/metformin 
The applicant proposed 3 FDC dose strengths, namely linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg, linagliptin 
2.5  mg  /metformin  850  mg,  and  linagliptin  2.5  mg/metformin  1000  mg.  To  substantiate  the 
effectiveness  of  these  3  dose  strengths,  the  placebo-controlled  trials  (1218.17,  1218.62,  1218.46, 
1218.18)  were  analysed by  metformin  dose  and  posology. Emphasis  was  placed  on  the  posologies  of 
500 mg  bid,  850 mg  bid  and  1000  mg  bid.  However,  except  in  study  1218.46,  in  which  all  patients 
took  either  metformin  500  mg  bid  or  1000  mg  bid,  the  proportions  of  patients  who  received  other 
doses  or  other  posologies  were  between  42.1%  (1218.62)  and  58.9%  (1218.17).  For  each  of  the 
studies  (1218.17,  1218.18,  1218.20,  1218.62),  the  analyses  that  comprised  all  ‘other’  metformin 
doses  demonstrated  that  the  linagliptin  treatment  effect  was  similar  to  the  efficacy  observed  for  the 
planned FDC combinations. 
Independent  of  metformin  dose,  the  addition  of  linagliptin  either  once  daily  or  twice  daily  led  to  a 
substantial and clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c. The magnitude of the combination treatment 
effect  was  largely  consistent  across  the  different  metformin  doses  with  adjusted  mean  changes  from 
baseline  of  -0.51%  to  -0.70%  after  24  weeks  of  treatment.  Only  for  the  850  mg  group  in  study 
1218.62  no  difference  between  metformin  850  mg  and  linagliptin  +  metformin  850  mg  could  be 
established. This was likely a consequence of the small number of patients in this analysis (metformin 
850 mg n=9; linagliptin 5 mg qd + metformin 850 mg n=55, linagliptin 2.5 mg bid + metformin 850 
mg,  n=57).  In  addition,  study  1218.46  showed  that  the  combination  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg  bid  + 
metformin 500 mg bid was at least as effective in reducing HbA 1c as metformin 1000 mg bid (-1.22% 
vs. -1.07%), adjusted mean difference -0.14%, p=0.1903. Thus, the linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 
mg FDC could be considered a useful alternative to metformin monotherapy for patients intolerant to 
the recommended daily metformin dose.  
For  all  placebo-controlled  trials,  ANCOVA  analyses  demonstrated  that  there  was  no  treatment-by-
metformin  dose  effect  for  the  reduction  of  HbA1c  (treatment-by-dose  p-values  0.2172  to  0.9846).  In 
the active-controlled study 1218.20, the adjusted mean changes (SE) from baseline in HbA1c after 104 
weeks of treatment were -0.10% (0.08) for linagliptin + metformin 850 mg bid and -0.12% (0.06) for 
linagliptin + metformin 1000 mg bid; the treatment-by-dose interaction p-value was 0.8056. Thus, it 
can  be  concluded  that  each  of  the  proposed  posologies  of  linagliptin  +  metformin  combinations  are 
efficacious in the reduction of HbA1c. A summary of the results by metformin dose is shown below.

For  the  850  mg  group  in  study  1218.62  no  difference  between  metformin  850  mg  and  linagliptin  + 
metformin  850  mg  could  be  established.  The  CHMP  is  in  agreement  with  the  Applicant  that  this  was 
likely  a  consequence  of  the  small  number  of  patients  in  this  analysis.  In  addition,  study  1218.46 
showed that the combination of linagliptin 2.5 mg bid + metformin 500 mg bid was at least as effective 
in reducing HbA1c as metformin 1000 mg bid (-1.22% vs. -1.07%). However, the proposed strength 
2.5 mg/500 mg was not considered acceptable by the CHMP. The minimal metformin dose assessed in 
the clinical studies was 1500 mg per day, which is in line with clinical practice. This is also in line with 
the  results  from  the  UKPDS.  In  this  study,  the  efficacy  of  metformin  in  reducing  T2DM  complications 
was  demonstrated,  but  the  great  majority  of  the  patients  were  treated  with  metformin  doses  >1700 
mg  per  day.  Although  there  might  be  a  minority  of  patients  who  cannot  tolerate  metformin  at  doses 
higher  than  1000  mg,  it is  unlikely  that  the  linagliptin  2.5  mg/metformin  500  mg  FDC  tablet  offers  a 
meaningful  benefit  compared  to  the  administration  of  the  separate  components.  In  addition,  the  low 
dose  FDC  tablet  could  promote  initial combination therapy  which  is  not  approved  and  not  covered  by 
current diabetes treatment guidelines.  
2.5.2. Main studies 
Linagliptin 
Four  pivotal  efficacy  studies  were  submitted  to  support  the  registration  of  linagliptin  5  mg  (Trajenta) 
(1218.15,  1218.16,  1218.17  and  1218.18).  These  studies  were  randomized,  multinational,  double-
blind,  placebo-controlled,  24  week  efficacy  studies.  Randomisation  was  stratified  by  HbA1c  (<8.5% 
versus ≥8.5%) and by the number of previous antidiabetic treatments as described below. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
  Adult  male  and  non-pregnant  female  patients  with  T2DM  either  on  previous  or  no  previous 
antidiabetic  agent  and  pre-defined  HbA1c  values  at  screening  and  randomisation,  (depending 
on previous AHA, for details see individual studies) 
  Age ≥18 to ≤80 years of age, 
  BMI ≤40 kg/m2,.  
Main exclusion criteria 


Treatment with insulin, GLP-1 analogues/agonists, or anti-obesity drugs within past 3 months; 
diabetic ketoacidosis within past 6 months; 
  heart failure NHYHA class III or IV; CV event within the past 6 months, 
 
 
 


Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  testing  the  superiority  hypothesis  of  linagliptin  versus  placebo  (as 
monotherapy or add-on) or the non-inferiority of linagliptin versus active control in decreasing HbA1c. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  all  the  studies  was  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  to  the  last  on-
treatment visit. 
Secondary  glycaemic  endpoints  included:  FPG,  proportion  of  patients  reaching  HbA1c  <  7.0%  or 
<6.5 %  or  HbA1c  reduction  of  at  least  0.5%.  Some  studies  included  a  meal  tolerance  test  (MTT,  in 
studies 1218.16, 1218.17).  
Other  relevant  endpoints  included:  use  of  rescue  therapy,  change  from  baseline  in  body  weight  after 
24  weeks  treatment  (presented  in  safety  part),  change  from  baseline in  waist  circumference  after  24 
weeks  of  treatment  (presented  in  safety  part)  and  change  from  baseline  in  lipid  parameters  after  24 
weeks of treatment (presented in safety section). 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was stratified by the HbA1c value at the beginning of the placebo run-in period (<8.5% 
versus ≥8.5%). Randomisation was also stratified by the number of oral antidiabetic drugs at the time 
of enrolment in most of the trials, except for study 1218.18. 
Blinding (masking) 
Access  to  the  randomisation  code  was  restricted  to  dedicated  randomisation  personnel.  Neither  the 
patient nor the investigator was aware of the identity of a patient’s treatment.  
Statistical methods 
The primary statistical analysis in all pivotal studies analyzed the change from baseline in HbA1c after 
24  weeks  of  treatment  using  an  ANCOVA  model  with  'treatment'  as  well  as  'prior  use  of  antidiabetic 
agents'  as  categorical  covariates  and  'baseline  HbA1c'  as  continuous  covariate.  The  primary  analysis 
was  conducted  at  the  2-sided  5%  level  of  significance  and  based  on  the  FAS  data  set.  Missing  data 
were  imputed  using  LOFC  (with  observations  obtained  under  rescue  medication  not  being  replaced) 
and additional sensitivity analyses were performed.  
Statistical methods employed are generally considered appropriate. 
Below are described aspects that were study specific: 
Study 1218.15 
This was a study in patients with T2DM to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg as initial 
combination  with  pioglitazone  30  mg  in  comparison  with  placebo  as  initial  combination  with 
pioglitazone 30 mg.  
Patients  were  treated  in  43  centers  in  Europe  and  Asia:  Japan  (24.9%),  Spain  (23.1%),  Hungary 
(21.9%), Romania (18.8%), Greece (6.4%), Austria (4.4%), Portugal (0.5%).  
The study period was from 15 April 2008 to 19 June 2009.

Methods 
Design 
This was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, consisting 
of  an  open-label,  2-week  placebo  run-in,  followed  by  a  24-week  double-blind  treatment  period  and  a 
1-week follow-up after termination of study medication. 
Study participants 
Patients  with  T2DM,  either  drug-naive  or  pre-treated  with  any  antidiabetic  agent  as  monotherapy  or 
combination therapy were recruited in this study. 
HbA 1c  at  screening  was  7.5%  to  11.0%  in  treatment  naïve  patients  and  7.0%  to  9.5%  in  pretreated 
patients. HbA1c at start of run-in: between 7.5% and 11.0%.  
Treatments 
Patients eligible after the run-in period were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to 24 weeks of treatment with 
either  5  mg 
linagliptin  or  placebo  as 
initial  combination  with  30  mg  pioglitazone 
(linagliptin+pioglitazone and placebo+pioglitazone respectively).  
Results  
Participant flow  
A total of 707 patients were enrolled and 389 were randomized (see table below). The most common 
reason for not being randomized was the HbA1c results before randomisation (42.5 %).

Conduct of the study 
There were three global and two local protocol amendments to the original clinical trial protocol. These 
amendments were considered not influencing the study results. 
No interim analysis was planned or performed for this study. 
Baseline data 
At study start, main demographic characteristics were as follows [mean (range)]: 
  Age: 57.5 y (25-79), 25.4 % of patients were ≥ 65, 
  BMI: 29.0 kg/m2 (16.8- 39.7), 42.2 % had a BMI ≥ 30,  
  Diabetes duration: 25.5 % had duration of diabetes up to 1 year, 42.4% >5 years. 
A  total  of  31.8%  of  the  patients  had  taken  one  antidiabetic  agent  and  18.4%  had  taken  ≥  2 
antidiabetic  agents.  Pre-treated  patients  were  mainly  on  metformin  monotherapy  (22.1%)  or  SU 
monotherapy (7.9%) or the combination of both (9.5%).  
Overall, 60.9% of patients were male, 74.6% were Caucasian and 24.9% Asian. 
Numbers analyzed 
In both groups, over 97.0% of patients were included in the primary FAS analysis and over 95% in the 
PPS analysis (see table below). 
Table 23.  Number of patients by analysis set –Randomized set 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Treatment  with  5  mg  once  daily  linagliptin  +  pioglitazone  was  superior  to  treatment  with  placebo  + 
pioglitazone in lowering HbA1c with a statistically significant difference of −0.51%. 
The unadjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c showed similar results.

Table 24.  Adjusted means for the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline at Week 24 – FAS 
(LOCF) 
In both treatment groups, HbA1c levels decreased until week 18 and remained stable thereafter. 
The secondary analysis PPS supports the results of the primary analysis, although the placebo adjusted 
treatment effect was smaller: -0.48 [-0.69; -0.28, 95 % CI] for HbA1c (mean difference).   
The  FAS-completers  showed  an  even  smaller  placebo  adjusted  treatment  effect:  -0.35  [-0.56;  -0.14, 
95 % CI] for HbA1c (mean difference).   
Adjusted mean HbA1c changes from baseline were similar between Asian and European populations (-
0.96  %  vs.  -1.09%,  respectively),  whereas  placebo-adjusted  changes  were  not  (-0.91%  vs.  -0.37%, 
respectively). 
Secondary endpoints: 
The addition of 5 mg qd linagliptin to pioglitazone was superior to placebo in addition to pioglitazone in 
lowering  FPG  resulting  in  a  treatment  difference  of  -14.2  mg/dL  (3.5  mmol/L).  The  results  were 
confirmed by the secondary FAS-completer analysis.  
A  larger  proportion  of  patients  in  the  linagliptin  +  pioglitazone  group  achieved  HbA1c  levels  <7%  or 
<6.5% or an HbA1c reduction of at least 0.5%.

Page 76/134
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 25.  Number of patients with categorical HbA1c change from baseline at Week 24 − 
FAS (LOCF) 
The  proportion  of  patients  requiring  rescue  therapy  was  7.9%  in  the  linagliptin  +  pioglitazone  group 
and  14.1%  in  the  placebo  +  pioglitazone  group.  The  odds  ratio  obtained  from  the  accompanying 
logistic regression was 0.446 (p<0.05). In addition, linagliptin + pioglitazone patients required rescue 
therapy later than placebo + pioglitazone patients. 
Other endpoints 
By  week  24,  both  treatment  groups  had  an  increase  in  mean  weight,  with  an  adjusted  mean  change 
from  baseline  that  was  greater  in  the  linagliptin  +  pioglitazone  group  (2.3  kg)  than  in  the  placebo  + 
pioglitazone  group  (1.2  kg).  This  translated  to  a  statistically  significant  treatment  difference  in  mean 
change from baseline of 1.10 kg (p<0.05). 
Discussion of the study results 
Overall,  superiority  of  linagliptin  +  pioglitazone  over  placebo  +  pioglitazone  was  demonstrated  in  the 
present  study  by  the  primary  endpoint  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  after  24  weeks  of  treatment. 
However,  the  placebo  adjusted  effect  of  linagliptin  (-0.51%)  was  rather  modest  and  of  borderline 
clinical relevance. The PPS analysis showed an even smaller effect (-0.48%). Clinically relevant effects 
on HbA1c were also not reached in patients on combination therapy prior to study. 
Due  to  differences  in  placebo  response,  the  placebo-adjusted  treatment  effect  was  larger  in  Asian 
patients (-0.91%) than in European patients (-0.37%). The treatment effect observed in the European 
population is not considered clinically relevant. 
Linagliptin  aggravated  the  pioglitazone-induced  weight  gain  by  a  yet  unknown  mechanism,  which  is 
clearly undesirable. 
Overall,  the  placebo-adjusted  glucose-lowering  effect  of  linagliptin  in  this  study  was  modest  and  of 
borderline  clinical  relevance.  European  patients,  the  relevant  population  for  this  application,  did  not 
have a relevant placebo-adjusted improvement in glycaemic control. Considering these efficacy results 
and  the  observed  weight  gain,  the  combination  therapy  of  linagliptin  +  pioglitazone  appears 
unfavourable.

Study 1218.16 
This  was  a  study  in  patients  with  T2DM  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  linagliptin  5  mg  as 
monotherapy in comparison to placebo. Patients were treated in 66 centers in in Asia 50.1 % (with the 
highest proportion of 26.8 % in India and of 14.3 % in Malaysia) and Europe 49.9% (with the highest 
proportion of 17.7% in Ukraine and of 12.3% Slovakia). The study period was 15 February 2008 to 06 
May 2009. 
Methods 
Design 
This was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, consisting 
of  an  open-label,  2-week  placebo  run-in,  followed  by  a  24-week  double-blind  treatment  period  and  a 
1-week follow-up after termination of study medication. 
Study participants 
Patients  with  T2DM,  either  drug-naive  or  pre-treated  with  not  more  than  one  antidiabetic  agent 
(except for PPARγ agonist) with a stable dose for 10 weeks prior study were included in this study.  
HbA 1c  at  screening  was  7.0%  to  10.0%  in  treatment  naïve  patients  and  6.5%  to  9.0%  in  pretreated 
patients. HbA1c at start of run-in was between 7.0% and 10.0%.  
There were no limitations in the degree of renal impairment in this study.  
Treatments 
Patients eligible at start of the run-in period were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to either 5 mg linagliptin or 
placebo.  
Outcomes/endpoints  
The primary and secondary endpoints are described above in the general method section above.  
In addition, PK/PD of linagliptin (plasma concentrations at trough after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment) 
was also an endpoint. 
To support the analysis of renal function during the trial, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) 
was  categorised  according  to  the  Modification  of  Diet  in  Renal  Disease  (MDRD)  staging,  and  the 
frequency of patients with shifts in renal impairment stage was investigated. In addition, renal function 
was  categorised  based  on  the  estimated  creatinine  clearance  (eCcr)  values  calculated  using  the 
Cockcroft-Gault formula. The stages of renal function are specified in the table below.

Results  
Participant flow  
A  total  of  935  patients  were  enrolled  and  503  were  randomized.  The  most  common  reason  for  not 
being randomized was the HbA1c at screening and before randomisation (38.2%). 
The discontinuation rates were higher in the placebo group (9%) compared  with the linagliptin group 
(5.4%) without a striking difference in any specific cause.  
Table 27.  Disposition of randomised patients –Screened set  
Conduct of the study 
There were three global and two local protocol amendments to the original clinical trial protocol. These 
amendments were not considered as influencing the study results. 
No interim analysis was planned or performed for this study. 
Baseline data 
At study start, the main demographic characteristics were as follows [mean (range)]: 
  Age: 55.7 y (24-79), 20.9 % of patients were ≥ 65 y,  
  BMI: 29.5 kg/m2 (16.0- 41.2), 40.0 % had a BMI ≥ 30, 
  Diabetes duration: 36.1% had duration of diabetes up to 1 year, 25.2% >5 years. 
A total of 56.5% of the patients had not previously taken an antidiabetic agent, 43.5% had taken one 
antidiabetic  agent.  Pre-treated  patients  were  mainly  on  metformin  monotherapy  (32.3%)  or  SU 
monotherapy (10.9%).  
Overall, 48.3% of patients were male, 53.7% were Caucasian and 46.1% Asian. 
43.1% of patients had an eGFR of ≥ 90 mL/min, 3.6% had an eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min.  
There were no relevant differences in the mean baseline characteristics between the treatment groups.

Numbers analysed 
In  both  groups,  over  97.0%  of  patients  were  included  in  the  primary  FAS  analysis,  over  93%  in  the 
PPS analysis and over 90& in the FAS-completers analysis.  
Table 28.  Number of patients by analysis set 
Outcomes and estimations 
Primary endpoint 
Treatment  with  5  mg  qd  linagliptin  was  superior  to  treatment  with  placebo  in  lowering  HbA1c  with  a 
statistically significant difference of −0.69% (p<0.0001). The unadjusted mean change from baseline 
in HbA1c showed similar results.  
Table 29.  Adjusted means for the change in HbA1c (%) from baseline at Week 24 – FAS 
(LOCF) 
In  the  linagliptin  group,  HbA1c  levels  decreased  until  week  12  and  remained  relatively  stable 
thereafter. In the placebo group, HbA1c levels increased slightly over time. 
The  secondary  analysis  PPS  supports  the  results  of  the  primary  analysis,  the  placebo  adjusted 
treatment effect was: -0.69 [-0.86; -0.53, 95 % CI] for HbA1c (mean difference). The FAS-completers 
showed a smaller placebo adjusted treatment effect: -0.56 [-0.73; -39, 95 % CI] for HbA1c.   
Whereas  the  mean  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  was  similar  for  Asian  and  Caucasian 
patients  (-0.45%  vs.  -0.42%,  respectively)  the  placebo-adjusted  change  was  not  (-0.91%  vs.  -
0.52%).

Secondary endpoints 
The  treatment  of  5  mg  QD  linagliptin  was  superior  to  placebo  in  lowering  FPG  resulting  in  a  mean 
treatment  difference  of  -23.3  (3.6)  mg/dL  at  week  24.  The  results  were  confirmed  by  the  secondary 
FAS-completer analysis.  
A larger proportion of patients in the linagliptin compared to the placebo group achieved HbA1c levels 
< 7% or < 6.5% or HbA1c reduction ≥0.5%. 
Table 30.  Number of patients with categorical HbA1c change from baseline at Week 24 − 
FAS (LOCF)  
Of the MTT parameters, difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in total glucose AUC at 
24 weeks between the two treatment groups was -3.26 mmol h/L with a statistically significant p-value 
of 0.0026, further supporting the results of the primary and secondary endpoints.  
The proportion of patients requiring rescue therapy was 20.9 % in the placebo group versus 10.2% in 
the linagliptin group. Based on the regression result, the odds of requiring rescue therapy was about 3 
times lower for patients treated with linagliptin compared to those taking placebo (odds ratio = 0.316, 
p < 0.05). 
Other endpoints 
In  patients  receiving  linagliptin,  the  median  DPP-4  inhibition  at  trough  was  greater  than  80%  with 
84.18% at week 12 and 82.81% at week 24 and thus constant over time.  
No meaningful change in the body weight was observed in either group. The difference in the adjusted 
means of change from baseline to 24 weeks in body weight between treatment groups was 0.28 kg. 
Pharmacokinetic results  
Analysis of linagliptin plasma concentrations at trough  was performed on the data with original results 
(OR).  The  geometric  mean  (gMean)  plasma  concentrations  of  linagliptin  at  trough  remained  constant 
over time. 
Mean  linagliptin  trough  levels  over  time  were  comparable  between  patients  with  normal,  mildly  or 
moderately impaired renal function.

Discussion of the study results 
In  the  present  study  linagliptin  at  dose  of  5  mg  QD  provided  statistically  significant  and  clinically 
relevant  improvement  in  glycaemic  control  in  patients  with  T2DM  not  sufficiently  controlled  on 
monotherapy (PPARγ agonists excluded) and in treatment naïve patients. Due to differences in placebo 
response,  the  placebo-adjusted  treatment  effect  was  larger  in  Asian  patients  (-0.91%)  than  in 
Caucasian  patients  (-0.52%).  The  results  on  HbA1c  were  supported  by  the  results  on  the  secondary 
endpoints. 
The data of pharmacokinetic properties in patients with mild to moderate degrees of renal insufficiency 
confirm that dose adjustment in these patients is not necessary.  
Study 1218.17 
This was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg 
as add-on therapy to metformin in comparison to placebo. Patients were treated in Asia, Europe, North 
America, South America and New Zealand. The study period was 31 January 2008 to 18 May 2009. 
Methods 
Design 
This was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, consisting 
of  an  open-label,  2-week  placebo  run-in,  followed  by  a  24-week  double-blind  treatment  period  and  a 
1-week follow-up after termination of study medication. 
Study participants 
Patients  with  T2DM,  pre-treated  with  either  metformin  alone  or  metformin  in  combination  with  one 
other  antidiabetic  agent  (except  pioglitazone,  rosiglitazone,  insulin)  unchanged  for  at  least  10  weeks 
prior  to  study  were  included.  A  dose  of ≥1500  mg/day  metformin  was  required  for  inclusion  into  the 
trial.  Minimal  required  dose  of  metformin  was  1500  mg  per  day  unless  the  investigator  documented 
patients to be on their maximum tolerated dose. 
HbA1c at screening was 7.0% to 10.0% in patients pre-treated on metformin alone and 6.5% to 9.0% 
in patients pre-treated on metformin in combination with one other antidiabetic agent.  
HbA1c at start of run-in was between 7.0% and 10.0%.

CHMP assessment report  
Page 82/134
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatments 
Patients eligible after the run-in period were randomised in 3:1 to either 5 mg linagliptin or placebo. 
Outcome/endpoints  
The primary and secondary endpoints are already covered in the general methods section above.  
In addition further endpoints were: 
-  MTT:  change  from  baseline  for  2-h  post-prandial  glucose  (2hPPG),  glucose  AUC,  insulin  AUC,  C-
peptide AUC, and insulin AUC to glucose AUC ratio. 
Results  
Participant flow  
A  total  of  1268  patients  were  enrolled  and  701  were  randomized.  The  most  common  reason  for  not 
being randomized was not meeting the HbA1c criteria (36.0%). 
The  highest  percentage  of  randomized  study  participants  were  from  Asia  (39.5%),  26.1%  were  from 
Europe, 18.7% from North America and 15.7% from South America.  
The premature discontinuation rates were 7.9% in the placebo group and 7.5% in the linagliptin group. 
The  main  reason  for  premature  discontinuation  was  in  both  groups,  refused  to  continue  trial 
medication.

Conduct of the study 
There were three global and two local protocol amendments to the original clinical trial protocol. These 
amendments are not considered as influencing the study results.  
No interim analysis was planned or performed for this study.

Baseline data 
At study start, the main demographic characteristics were as follows [mean (range)]: 
  Age: 56.5 y (21-79), 22.0% of patients were ≥ 65 y,  
  BMI: 29.9 kg/m2 (19.1-52.3), 43.9 % had a BMI ≥ 30,  
  Diabetes duration: 34.0% had duration of diabetes > 1 to 5 years, 54.9% >5 years. 
Overall,  54.1%  of  patients  were  male,  76.1%  were  Caucasian  and  20.9%  were  Asian.  In  both 
treatment groups, around 20% of the patients were of Hispanic/Latino origin. 
Pre-treated patients were mainly on metformin monotherapy (68.6%) or on combination of metformin 
plus sulfonylurea (26.9%). 
59.1%  of  patients  had  an  eGFR  of  ≥  90  mL/min,  37.6%  had  an  eGFR  60  to  <  90  mL/min  and  3.3% 
had an eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min. 
There were no relevant differences in baseline efficacy variables. 
The  study  population  adequately  represents  the  intended  target  population  of  patients  with  T2DM, 
patients on metformin alone or in combination with one other oral antidiabetic agent  with insufficient 
glycaemic  control.  The  age  group  65  to  74  years  (19.8%  in  the  placebo  group  and  18.7%  in  the 
linagliptin group) was rather small to reflect the real proportion of T2DM and the group of ≥ 75 years 
(3.4% placebo and 2.9% linagliptin) was not sufficiently considered.  
Numbers analysed 
In both treatment groups, more than 97% of patients were included in the primary FAS analysis and 
more than 89% in the secondary FAS-completers and PPS analysis. Treatment compliance was 97.7% 
in the placebo and 96.8% and thus similar between both treatment groups 
Table 33.  Number of patients by analysis set 
Outcomes and estimations 
Primary endpoint 
The  add-on  of  5  mg  QD  linagliptin  to  metformin  was  superior  to  add-on  of  placebo  to  metformin  in 
lowering  HbA1c  with  an  adjusted  mean  treatment  difference  of  -0.64%  (p<  0.0001).  The  unadjusted 
mean change from baseline in HbA1c showed similar results.

Table 34.  Adjusted  means  for  the  change  in  HbA1c  (%)  from  baseline  at  Week  24  –  FAS 
(LOCF) 
In  the  linagliptin  group,  HbA1c  levels  decreased  until  week  12  and  remained  relatively  stable 
thereafter. In the placebo group, HbA1c levels increased minimally over time. 
The  secondary  analysis  PPS  supports  the  results  of  the  primary  analysis,  the  placebo  adjusted 
treatment  effect  was:  -0.68  [-0.84;  -0.53,  95  %  CI]  p<.0001  for  HbA1c  (mean  diference).  The  FAS-
completers  showed  a  smaller  placebo  adjusted  treatment  effect:  -0.57  [-0.72;  -42,  95  %  CI]  for 
HbA1c.  
Whereas  the  adjusted  mean  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  was  slightly  smaller  for  Asian  than  for 
European  patients  (-0.49%  vs.  -0.57%,  respectively),  contrasting  results  were  obtained  for  the 
placebo-adjusted changes (-0.73% vs. -0.51%). 
Secondary endpoints 
The  add-on  of  5  mg  QD  linagliptin  to  metformin  was  superior  to  add-on  of  placebo  to  metformin  in 
lowering FPG with an adjusted mean treatment difference of -21.1 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L).  
More  patients  on  linagliptin  compared  to  placebo  achieved  HbA1c  values  of  <7%  or  <6.5%  or  an 
HbA1c reduction of ≥0.5%.

Table 35.  Number  of  patients  with  categorical  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  at  Week  24  − 
FAS (LOCF)  
In the MTT subpopulation the treatment difference in adjusted mean change from baseline at week 24 
was  -67.13  mg/dL  (p<0.05)  for  2hPPG  and  -5.35  mmol  h/L  (p<0.05)  for  glucose  AUC  in  favour  of 
linagliptin.  
The proportion of patients requiring the use of rescue medication was 18.9% in the placebo group and 
7.8%  in  the  linagliptin  group  (odds  ratio  0.276,  p  <  0.05).  In  addition  linagliptin  patients  required 
rescue therapy later than placebo patients. 
Other endpoints 
The treatment difference in the adjusted means of change from baseline to 24 weeks in body weight 
was estimated to be 0.04 kg. 
Discussion of the study results 
The  results  of  this  study  showed  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  (albeit  moderate) 
superior efficacy of linagliptin 5 mg as add-on in comparison to placebo add-on in patients with T2DM 
with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  on  metformin.  Results  of  primary  and  secondary  analyses  were 
consistent.  
Due  to  differences  in  placebo  response,  the  placebo-adjusted  treatment  effect  was  larger  in  Asian 
patients (-0.73%) than in European patients (-0.51%).  
Study 1218.18 
This was a study in patients with T2DM to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg as add-
on  to  metformin  in  combination  with  a  SU  in  comparison  to  placebo.  Patients  were  treated  in  the 
following countries: Argentina, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Korea, Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, 
Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The study period was from 25 February 2008 to 21 May 2009. 
Methods 
Design 
This was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, consisting 
of  an  open-label,  2-week  placebo  run-in,  followed  by  a  24-week  double-blind  treatment  period  and  a 
1-week follow-up after termination of study medication.

Study participants 
Patients with T2DM, pre-treated only with a stable daily dose of ≥ 1500 mg per day (or  documented 
maximally tolerated dose) of metformin and a maximally tolerated dose of a SU both unchanged for at 
least 10 weeks prior to study were included. 
HbA1c at screening and after the placebo run-in period had to be between 7.0% and 10.0%.  
Treatments 
Patients  eligible  after  the  run-in  period  were  randomised  in  a  3:1  ratio  to  either  5  mg  linagliptin  or 
placebo. 
Results  
Participant flow  
A  total  of  1598  patients  were  enrolled  and  1058  were  randomized.  The  most  common  reason  for  not 
being randomized was not fulfilling HbA1c criteria (26 %). 
The  highest  percentage  of  randomized  study  participants  were  from  Asia  (50.6%),  whereas  only 
18.7% were from Europe and the lowest percentage from North America (8.7%). 
The discontinuation rates were 8.0% in the placebo group and 7.3% in the linagliptin group. The main 
reasons  for  premature  discontinuation  were  refused  to  continue  trial  medication  (3%)  in  the  placebo 
group and adverse events (2.9%) in the linagliptin group.

No interim analysis was planned or performed for this study. 
Baseline data 
At study start, the main demographic characteristics were as follows [mean (range)]: 
  Age: 58.1 y (23-79), 27.3% of patients were ≥ 65 y,  
  BMI:  28.33 kg/m2 (15.75-39.97), 32% had a BMI ≥ 30,  
  Diabetes duration: 23.9% had duration of diabetes > 1 to 5 years, 73.3% >5 years. 
Overall,  47.2%  of  patients  were  male,  46.6%  were  Caucasian  and  51.7%  were  Asian.  In  both 
treatment groups, around 22% of the patients were of Hispanic/Latino origin. 
57.0% had an eGFR ≥90 and 5% an eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min. 
There  were  no  relevant  differences  in  mean  values  of  baseline  characteristics  including  efficacy 
variables. 
The study population adequately represents the intended target population of patients with T2DM with 
an  insufficient  glycaemic  control  despite  a  background  therapy  of  metformin  and  a  SU.  However,  the 
very elderly subgroup of T2DM of ≥ 75 years (3.0% placebo and 4.8% linagliptin) was not sufficiently 
considered. 
Numbers analysed 
In both groups, over 98% of patients were included in the primary FAS analysis, over 93% in the PPS 
analysis  and  over  90%  in  the  FAS-completers  analysis  (see  table  below).  Treatment  compliance  was 
96.5% in the placebo and 97.8% in the linagliptin group.

Outcomes and estimations 
Primary endpoint 
The  add-on  of  5  mg  QD  linagliptin  to  metformin  and  a  SU  was  superior  to  add-on  of  placebo  in 
lowering HbA1c resulting in mean adjusted mean treatment difference of -0.62%.

Table 38.  Adjusted  means  for  the  change  in  HbA1c  (%)  from  baseline  at  Week  24  –  FAS 
(LOCF) 
The  secondary  PPS  analysis  supports  the  results  of  the  primary  analysis,  the  placebo  adjusted 
treatment effect was: -0.61 [-0.73; -0.49, 95 % CI] p<.0001) for HbA1c (mean difference). 
The  FAS-completers  showed  a  smaller  placebo  adjusted  treatment  effect  [95%CI]:  -0.54  [-0.66;  -
0.42] p<.0001 for HbA1c. 
HbA1c results were similar in patients on metformin doses ≥ 1500 mg and <1500 mg. 
Whereas the adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline was similar for Asian and European patients 
(-0.69%  vs.  -0.63%,  respectively),  placebo-adjusted  changes  were  not  (-0.69%  vs.  -0.47%, 
respectively). 
No significant effect of the baseline metformin dose was observed on HbA1c in this trial. 
Secondary endpoints: 
The  add-on  of  5  mg  QD  linagliptin  to  metformin  and  a  SU  was  superior  to  the  add-on  of  placebo  in 
lowering FPG  resulting with an adjusted mean treatment difference of -12.7 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L). The 
results were confirmed by the secondary FAS-completer analysis.  
A larger proportion of patients in the linagliptin compared to the placebo group achieved HbA1c levels 
< 7% or < 6.5% or HbA1c reduction ≥0.5% (see table below).

Table 39.  Number  of  patients  with  categorical  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  at  Week  24  − 
(NCF) – FAS 
The number of patients requiring rescue therapy was 34 (13.0%) in the placebo group and 42 (5.4%) 
in the linagliptin group (odds ratio: 0.361, p<0.0001). The median time to start of rescue therapy was 
shorter (119 days) for patients under placebo than for patients under linagliptin treatment (132 days).  
Other endpoints 
No meaningful change in body weight was noted in both treatment groups.  
Discussion of the study results 
In  the  present  study,  linagliptin  add-on  at  a  dose  of  5  mg  q.d.  provided  statistically  significant  and 
clinically  relevant  (albeit  modest)  improvement  in  glycaemic  control  compared  to  placebo  add-on  in 
patients  with  T2DM  not  sufficiently  controlled  on  metformin  and  a  sulfonylurea.  The  superiority  was 
reflected  in  all  glycaemic  parameters  evaluated  and  the  proportion  of  patients  requiring  rescue 
therapy.  
Due  to  differences  in  placebo  response,  the  placebo-adjusted  treatment  effect,  again,  was  larger  in 
Asian patients (-0.69%) than in European patients (-0.47%). 
Metformin 
Antidiabetic  therapy  with  metformin  is  associated  with  dose-related  reductions  in  HbA1c  and  FPG. 
According to literature data, treatment with metformin 500 to 2000 mg per day decreases HbA1c levels 
by 0.4% to 2.0% and decreases FPG levels by 5.4 to 68.4 mg/dL. 
No  additional  clinical  efficacy  studies  have  been  conducted  for  metformin  as  monotherapy  However, 
efficacy  data  for  metformin  monotherapy  are  available  from  the  placebo-controlled  trials  for  the 
combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin, where metformin was taken either as background 
therapy as in studies 1218.17 and 1218.62 or as study medication as in study 1218.46 (metformin 500 
mg  bid  or  1000  mg  bid).  Placebo-controlled  efficacy  data  for  metformin  monotherapy  from  study 
1218.46  are  shown  in  the  table  below.  After  24  weeks  of  treatment,  both  metformin  doses  led  to 
reductions in HbA 1c and FPG that were consistent with literature data.

Methods 
Design, randomisation, blinding and treatment 
This  was  a  phase  3  multinational,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group, 
factorial  design  study  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  twice  daily  administration  of  the  free 
combination of linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin 500 mg or of linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin 1000 mg, 
with the individual components of metformin (500 mg or 1000 mg, twice daily) and linagliptin (5 mg, 
once daily) over 24 weeks in drug naïve (47.5%) or previously treated (4 weeks washout and 2 weeks 
placebo  run-in)  T2DM  patients  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control.  The  study  period  was  from  5 
December 2008 to 26 May 2010. 
Patients  who  met  the  trial  eligibility  criteria  at  the  end  of  the  2-week  placebo  run-in  period  were 
randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups in a 1 (placebo):2:2:2:2:2 ratio. Randomisation was 
stratified by baseline A1C and number of prior oral antidiabetic drug (OADs). 
All  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  double  blind  study  drug  utilizing  a  double-dummy  design  to 
ensure adequate blinding.   
Subjects  with  baseline  HbA1C  of  ≥11%  were  enrolled  into  an  open-label  arm.  Details  of  the  study 
design are given in the figure below. 
Patients who regularly completed the randomised period of this study were offered to participate in an 
extension trial (study 1218.52).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint : 
The primary endpoint was change in HbA1C from baseline to week 24. 
Secondary endpoints: 
  Change from baseline in FPG at Week 24 
  Responder rates: HbA1C< 7.0% and  < 6.5%  
  Reduction in HbA1C ≥ 0.5% 
  Change from baseline in 2h PPG at Week 24 
  Use of rescue medication 
Objectives, statistical methods and sample size 
The  trial  was  designed  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  the  2  free  combination  treatments  consisting  of 
different doses of linagliptin plus metformin over the individual components with regards to change in 
HbA1C. 
Sample size was calculated to detect a true difference (deltas) in mean change from baseline A1C for 
the individual treatment-comparisons as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
Linagliptin plus metformin 500 mg vs. linagliptin: -0.8% 
Linagliptin plus metformin 1000 mg vs. linagliptin: -1.0% 
Linagliptin plus metformin 500 mg vs. metformin 500 mg: -0.5% 
Linagliptin plus metformin 1000 mg vs. metformin 1000 mg: -0.5% 
Linagliptin vs. placebo: -0.5% 
  Metformin 500 mg vs. placebo: -0.8% 
  Metformin 1000 mg vs. placebo: -1.0% 
for a two tailed test at α = 0.05 with a power of >90%. 
A standard deviation (SD) for HbA1C change from baseline of 1.1% was used for the calculation of the 
sample size.  
Randomised part 
Primary  endpoint:  4  confirmatory  hypotheses  in  regard  to  the  HbA1C  change  from  baseline  were 
tested. These hypotheses were ordered hierarchically and tested sequentially at the level of α = 0.05 
(2-sided).

A  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  approach  was  used  to  replace  missing  data.  In  general, 
baseline values were not carried forward, but could be used for interpolation.  
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed (e.g. MMRM and observed cases approach).

Conduct of the study 
In  total,  54 patients  (6.8%)  ranging  from  2  patients  (1.4%)  in  the  Met  500  mg  group  to  17  patients 
(11.6%) in the Met 1000 mg group, were reported with protocol violations (PVs) related to efficacy (no 
PVs  related  to  safety)  that  led  to  exclusion  from  the  Per-Protocol-Set  (PPS).  The  PVs  were  related  to 
entrance  criteria  not  met,  trial  medication  and  randomisation,  concomitant  medication,  and  missing 
data. In the open label arm 21 patients (31.8%) reported PVs.  
According  to  the  clinical  stuyd  report,  there  were  a  few  protocol  amendments  mainly  related  to  the 
level of HbA1C at inclusion.

During the course of the study, concerns were expressed about the overall quality of the source data 
documentation  and  study  conduct  at  one  German  site.  As  a  result  from  these  concerns,  the  site  was 
closed prematurely in the course of the extension study 1218.52. It was decided to include the data of 
these patients in the study analysis of 1218.46, as the audit findings were unlikely to affect the overall 
validity of the study data. There were no acute safety concerns for the patients. 
Study 1218.62  
This  study  was  performed  on  request  of  the  CHMP.  It  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled, 3 parallel group efficacy and safety study of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily versus 5 mg once 
daily over 12 weeks as add-on therapy to a twice daily dosing regimen of metformin in patients with 
type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  insufficient  glycaemic  control  HbA1c  ≥7.0-≤10.0%)  on  metformin  (at 
least 1500 mg/day, bid or maximum tolerated dose if lower than this). Patients had to be between 18 
and  80  years  of  age  and  had  to  have  a  BMI  up  to  45  kg/m2.  Metformin  was  administered  as 
background  therapy  in  an  unchanged  total  daily  dosage  throughout  the  trial  (including  wash-out, 
placebo run-in, 12-week randomised treatment, and follow-up phases).  
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c. The primary analysis was performed on 
the  full  analyses  set  (FAS),  with  a  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  approach  used  to  replace 
missing data. Important secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG) and the occurrence of treat-to-target response (i.e. HbA1c on treatment <7.0%). 
Subject disposition 
A  total  of  771  patients  were  enrolled,  491  patients  were  randomised  in  a  1:5:5  ratio  to  receive 
treatment with either placebo (44 patients), linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily (223 patients) or linagliptin 5 
once daily (224 patients). Of the 491 patients treated with randomised study medication, 464 patients 
(94.5%)  completed  the  planned  12-week  treatment  period  and  27  patients  (5.5%)  prematurely 
discontinued the trial medication. The rate of premature discontinuations was higher in the linagliptin 
2.5 bid group (7.2%) compared to the linagliptin 5 qd and placebo treatment groups (4.5% and 2.3%, 
respectively). In the placebo group, one of the 44 treated patients discontinued (cause: Other). In the 
linagliptin 2.5 bid group, the most frequent reasons for premature discontinuation were due to adverse 
events  (3.6%),  refusal  to  continue  trial  medication  (1.8%),  and  non-compliance  with  the  protocol 
(1.3%). In the linagliptin 5 qd group, the most frequent reasons were due to non-compliance with the 
protocol (2.2%) and adverse events (1.3%). 
Baseline data 
More  than  half  of  the  population  was  male  (total  57.0%).  Nearly  two  thirds  of  the  population  was 
White  (total  65.4%)  and  about  one  third  was  Asian  (total  33.8%).  The  mean  age  was  58.6  years 
(total) with the largest proportion of patients being 65 years of age or younger (total 69.5%). All three 
treatment groups had comparable distribution of patients across age groups. In total, the mean weight 
was  81.0  kg  and  the  mean  BMI  was  29.6  kg/m2.  Almost  three-quarters  of  the  patients  were  pre-
treated  with  metformin  monotherapy  (71.3%  total),  with  comparable  percentages  seen  across 
treatment groups. A total of 28.7% of patients were pre-treated with combination therapy (metformin 
and 1 ‘other’ OAD) prior to study entry and underwent a washout period for the ‘other’ OAD.

Outcome and estimation 
HbA1c 
In  study  1218.62,  the  baseline  mean  HbA1c  percent  values  were  comparable  between  the  treatment 
groups  and  the  overall  mean  HbA1c  was  7.97%.  The  adjusted  mean  treatment  difference  in  HbA1c 
change  from  baseline  to  Week  12  for  linagliptin  2.5  twice  daily  over  placebo  was  -0.74%  (95%  CI  -
0.97,  -0.52),  p<0.0001,  Table  5  upper  panel).  For  linagliptin  5  mg  over  placebo  the  adjusted  mean 
difference was -0.80% (95% CI -1.02, -0.58), p<0.0001). The adjusted mean treatment difference for 
linagliptin  2.5  mg  twice  daily  vs.  linagliptin  5  mg  once  daily  was  0.06%  (95%  CI  -0.07,  0.19), 
indicating  non-inferiority  as  the  upper  bound  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  was  below  the  pre-
specified margin of 0.35% (see figure below).

Study 1218.46 yielded qualitatively similar results to other studies described above (pivotal studies for 
the  linagliptin  MAA),  mean  baseline  HbA1c  values  were  comparable  between  the  treatment  groups, 
ranging  from  8.52   %  in patients  treated  with  metformin  1000  mg  to  8.71%  in  patients  treated  with 
linagliptin  2.5  mg  +  metformin  500  mg.  The  linagliptin  +  metformin  groups  were  superior  to  both 
metformin monotherapy groups and also to linagliptin monotherapy. The mean treatment difference in 
HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24  was  -0.51%  for  the  free  combination  of  linagliptin  2.5    mg  + 
metformin  1000  mg  compared  to  the  individual  component  metformin  1000  mg,  -1.14%  for  the  free 
combination of linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin 1000 mg compared to linagliptin 5mg, -0.58% for the 
free  combination  of  linagliptin  2.5    mg+  metformin  500  mg  compared  to  the  individual  component 
metformin  500  mg,  and  -0.77%  for  the  free  combination  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg+  metformin  500  mg 
compared  to  linagliptin  5  mg  (see  figure  below).  In  this  study,  linagliptin  was  investigated  in  initial 
combination with metformin. At least half of the patients was not treated with oral antidiabetic drugs 
before inclusion in the study. This is not in line with the requested indication for linagliptin/metformin 
in patients that are insufficiently controlled with metformin or metformin in combination with SU. The 
inclusion  of  treatment  naive  patients  resulted  in  an  overestimation  of  the  treatment  effects  of 
metformin in this study. Nevertheless, the treatment effects of linagliptin were similar in patients that 
were pretreated and those that were treatment naive. In this study, the treatment effect of linagliptin 
2.5 mg twice daily was smaller in Asians compared to Whites (-0.42% vs. -0.65% in combination with 
metformin 500 mg;-0. 39% vs. -0.59% in combination with metformin 1000 mg).

Results  of  other  glycaemic  parameters,  such  as  patients  reaching  their  goal  HbA1c,  fasting  plasma 
glucose, were in line with HbA1c results.

Body weight 
In study 1218.17 and 1218.18, the effect of combination therapy was shown to be neutral in regard to 
body weight. In study 1218.20, after 104 weeks of treatment, a decrease in body weight was noted in 
the  linagliptin  +  metformin  group  as  opposed  to  a  weight  gain  in  the  glimepiride  +  metformin  group 
(treatment  difference  of  -2.7  kg  (p  <0.0001)).  In  study  1218.46  and  its  extension  study  1218.52  as 
well as in study 1218.62, the mean changes in body weight were between -1.1 kg and -0.01 kg across 
all treatment groups. 
Subgroup analyses 
The 24-week trials 1218.17 and 1218.46 were pooled (n=1244). For most subgroups investigated, the 
treatment  effect  was  consistent  and  the  achieved  changes  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  were  comparable 
across  all  subcategories.  Thus,  the  factors  age,  gender,  ethnicity,  geographical  region,  baseline  BMI, 
and  baseline  HbA1c  did  not  have  an  influence  on  the  efficacy  of  the  combination  therapy  with 
linagliptin + metformin. The treatment effect of linagliptin + metformin compared with metformin was 
almost identical in Europe (n=442) and in Asia (n=446) with HbA1c changes of -0.56% (Europe) and -
0.59% (Asia), and p-values below 0.0001. Likewise, for race there was no difference between White (-
0.61%)  and  Asian  (-0.57%)  patients  in  the  efficacy  of  linagliptin  +  metformin  compared  with 
metformin (p<0.0001 for both races). Treatment effects were smaller, but acceptable in patients with 
prior OADs and a longer time since diagnosis of diabetes. Patients with hepatic impairment were also 
not investigated in sufficient amount. The number of patients aged 75 years or above was very low (in 
the  grouping  of  1218.17  and  1218.46  only  24  patients  >75  years  were  included).  It  is  difficult  to 
estimate the effect of linagliptin on HbA1c in elderly patients. During the evaluation, a study in elderly 
patients  was  submitted  (1218.63).  This  study  was  a  phase  III  multi-national,  randomised,  double-
blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group,  efficacy  and  safety  study  of  linagliptin  (5  mg),  administered 
orally  once  daily  over  24  weeks  in  type  2  diabetic  (T2DM)  patients,  age  ≥70  years,  with  insufficient 
glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥7.0%) despite metformin and/or sulphonylurea (SU) and/or insulin therapy. 
241  patients  were  randomised  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  treatment  either  with  linagliptin  5  mg  (162 
patients) or placebo (79 patients). Mean age was 74.9±4.3 years. The estimated treatment difference 
between  linagliptin  (n=160)  and  placebo  (n=78),  calculated  as  the  adjusted  mean  change  from 
baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24,  was  -0.64%  (95%  CI  [-0.81;  -0.48],  p<0.0001),  demonstrating 
superiority of linagliptin over placebo in the reduction of HbA1c.  
Trials with a longer treatment duration 
Long  term  efficacy  of  linagliptin  in  combination  with  metformin  was  investigated  in  the  double  blind 
extension  of  study  1218.46  (study  1218.52).  Throughout  the  entire  treatment  duration  of  78  weeks, 
the linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin 1000 mg combination achieved greater reductions in mean HbA1c 
than  the  metformin  1000  bid  group.  In  addition,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  required  rescue 
medication up to Week 78 was lower in the linagliptin 2.5+ metformin1000 mg bid group (12.6%) than 
in the metformin 1000 mg bid group (22.9%).

1218.46 and 1218.52 - FAS (OC) 
Long  term  efficacy  of  linagliptin  5  mg  in  combination  with  metformin  or  metformin  with  SU  was  also 
investigated  in  study  1218.40,  the  open-label  extension  of  study  1218.17  and  1218.18.  Interim 
analyses were presented in the MAA for Trajenta (linagliptin). New interim analyses provided efficacy 
data  for  linagliptin  up  to  102  weeks.  The  decrease  in  HbA1c  was  maintained  in  the  individuals  that 
continued  the  use  of  linagliptin  with  metformin.  However,  38.7%  of  the  patients  using  linagliptin  in 
combination with metformin required rescue medication, and 33.8% of the patients using linagliptin in 
combination  with  metformin  and  SU  required  rescue  medication.  The  relatively  large  proportion  of 
patients  requiring  rescue  medication  in  the  extension  trials  in  comparison  to  the  initial  trials  was  a 
concern.  However,  it  is  conceivable  that  this  is  explained  by  the  low  threshold  for  the  initiation  of 
rescue  therapy,  the  long  study  duration  and  the  fact  that  the  extension  trials  also  allowed  entry  for 
patients who already received rescue medication in the initial trials.

Analysis 
description 
Primary  Analysis:  After  24  weeks  of  treatment  an  analysis  of  covariance 
(ANCOVA)  was  performed  to  compare  the  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c. 
The model included 'treatment' and 'prior use of antidiabetic agents' as fixed 
effects and 'baseline HbA1c' as covariate. The primary analysis was conducted 
at the 2-sided 5% level of significance.

description 
Primary Analysis: after 24 weeks of treatment an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) was performed to compare the change from baseline in HbA1c. 
The model included 'treatment' as fixed effect and 'baseline HbA1c' as 
covariate. The primary analysis was conducted at the 2-sided 5% level of 
significance.

Supportive studies 
Long-term  efficacy  and  safety  were  examined  in  studies:  1218.20,  1218.23  and  1218.40.  Other 
supportive studies submitted with this application are studies 1218.35 and 1218.50. 
Study 1218.52 
This  was  a  multinational  phase  III  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  group,  extension  study  to 
investigate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  twice  daily  administration  of  the  free  combination  of  linagliptin 
2.5
 mg + metformin 500 mg or of linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin
 1000 mg versus monotherapy with 
m
etformin 1000 mg twice daily over 54 weeks in T2DM patients previously completing the double-blind 
p
art of study 1218.46 and not requiring rescue therapy. 
There  was  no  primary  endpoint  for  efficacy  in  this  study.  Instead,  safety  and  efficacy  were  assessed 
through descriptive analyses. Change in HbA1C was assessed as a secondary endpoint.  
The mean HbA1C results are displayed in the below table.

*In the observed cases (OC) analysis, missing data were not replaced. Values measured after rescue medication was set to missing. 
Mean  HbA1C  remained  fairly  stable  in  all  3  treatment  groups,  indicating  persistence  of  the  glucose-
lowering  effect  of  metformin  monotherapy  and  the  combination  of  linagliptin  and  metformin  up  to 
Week  54.  However,  one  must  bear  in  mind  that  only  a  limited  number  of  the  included  subjects  have
reached the end of the study (78 weeks) in this partial initial combination setting that differs from the 
applied add-on setting.  
Study 1218.20  
It  was  a  multinational,  randomised,  double-blind,  active-controlled  study  to  evaluate  efficacy  and 
safety  of  linagliptin  5  mg  compared  to  glimepiride  over  two  years,  in  T2DM  patients  with  insufficient 
glycaemic  control  despite  metformin  therapy.  After  52  weeks,  lnagliptin  was  associated  with  a 
decrease  in  HbA1c  of  -0.38%,  and  glimepiride  was  associated  with  a  decrease  of  -0.60%  in  the  full 
analysis  set  (FAS).  According  to  the  pre-defined  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.35%  for  HbA1c,  non-
inferior efficacy of linagliptin vs. glimepiride could be shown in the primary FAS analysis at 52 weeks 
(treatment  difference  0.22%).  The  PPS  analysis  showed  a  slightly  higher  tre
atment  difference  with  a 
mean value of 0.26%. After 104 weeks, linagliptin was associated with a decrease in HbA1c of -0.16%, 
and  glimepiride  was  associated  with  a  decrease  of  -0.36%  in  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  with  a  mean 
treatment difference of 0.20%. The PPS (LOCF) analysis again showed a larger treatment difference of 
0.28% in HbA1C. 
Study  12
18.23
  was a placebo and active-controlled study using voglibose. Voglibose is not approved 
in the EU and, therefore, the comparison with voglibose is not considered relevant for this application. 
Study  1218.40 was an open-label extension trial without a control group in patients who completed 
one of the 4 pivotal placebo-controlled trials (1218.15, 1218.16, 1218.17, or 1218.18). The objective 
was primarily to evaluate safety of 5 mg linagliptin during long-term treatment as monotherapy or in 
combination  with  metformin,  pioglitazone,  or  metformin  in  addition  to  a  sulphonylurea  drug. 
Furthermore,  the  objective  was  to  assess  efficacy  in  a  descriptive  exploratory  way.  All  patients 
received 5 mg
 linagliptin.  
Patients were analysed according to their previous exposure to linagliptin. In the group of patients who 
had  receiv
ed  linagliptin  in  the  previous  studies,  the  HbA1c  levels  achieved  during  the  24  weeks  of 
treatment  in  the  previous  trials  were  maintained  in  this  extension  stud
y  until  week  42.  Thereafter, 
HbA1c appeared to increase slightly but patient numbers were small.  
In  the  group  of  patients  who  had  been  randomised to  placebo  in  the  previous  studies,  the  maximum 
effect  of  linagliptin  on  HbA1c  was  observed  at  Week  18  of  this  extension  study  (mean  change  from 
baseline:  -0.68%).  From  Week  30  to  Week  42,  no  further  reductions  in  mean  HbA1c  values  were 
observable. Subsequently, HbA1c levels started to slightly increase again but patient number became 
smaller.

Study  1218.35  was  a  multinational,  18-week  study  investigating  efficacy  and  safety  of  5  mg 
linagliptin in combination with a SU.  
Linagliptin was superior in reducing HbA1c compared to placebo with a mean treatment difference of -
0.47%  (95%  CI  -0.7,  -0.24)  at  week  18  week.  However,  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  effect  is 
considered  questionable.  Subgroup  analysis  confirmed  that  gender  did  not  influence  the  treatment 
response. 
Asian  patients  had  a  larger  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  (-0.76%)  than  European  (-0.40%)
patients.  
The placebo-adjusted effect on HbA1c in European patients was -0.29%.

Study  1218.50  investigated  efficacy  and  safety  of  linagliptin  5  mg  compared  to  placebo  (part  1,  18 
weeks) and to glimepiride (part 2, 34 weeks) in patients intolerant to metformin therapy. 93% of study 
population did not tolerate metformin due to gastrointestinal intolerance. 
At week 18 linagliptin was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c with a mean treatment difference of -
0.57%.  Secondary  results  were  consistent.  The  mean  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  was  small  and 
similar in Asian (-0.35%) and European (-0.37%) patients. However, the placebo-adjusted treatment 
mean change in HbA1c was l
arger in Asian patients (-0.80%) than in Caucasian patients (-0.45%).  
The results of part 2 of the study (double-blind extension period, where placebo  patients switched to 
glimepiride)  were  provided  with  the  linagliptin  MAA.  The  results  showed  a  fall  in  the  mean  HbA1c 
change from baseline in the control group (glimepiride) from Week 18 to Week 30 and thereafter the 
mean  was  fairly  constant.  The  mean  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  remained  constant  for  linagliptin 
from  Week  18  throughout  the  remainder  of  the  trial.  There  were  differences  in  mean  HbA1c  from 
baseline  between  linagliptin  and  glimepiride  from  Week  30  onwards,  with  glimepiride  having  a  larger 
decrease from baseline compared with linagliptin. The treatment with glimepiride induced a decrease in 
HbA1c of 0.82%, whereas linagliptin was associated with a decrease of 0.44%. 
2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Linagliptin 5 mg has been approved in combination with metformin and metformin plus sulphonylurea. 
In  addition,  linagliptin  5  mg  has  been  approved  for  use  as  monotherapy  in  patients  inadequately 
controlled  by  diet  and  exercise  alone and  for  who
m metformin  is inappropriate  due  to  intolerance,  or 
contraindicated due to
 renal impairment.  
The Applicant now proposes a fixed dose combination of linagliptin 2.5 mg and metformin 500 mg, 850 
mg or 1000 mg bid. The lowest proposed strength, i.e. linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg, contains 
a dose of metformin with a questionable benefit in terms of effects on HbA1C and clinical outcome. In 
the UKPDS study, the efficacy of metformin in reducing T2DM complications was demonstrated, but the 
great majority of patients was treated with metformin doses >1700 mg per day. Therefore, metformin 
500 mg bid is considered only a starting dose that should be increased first before linagliptin is added. 
The  Applicant  was  requested  by  the  CHMP  to  justify  this  lowest  dosage  strength  on  the  basis  of  the 
clinical  data  of  Jentadueto  and  of  the  use  of  metformin  500  mg  bid  in  clinical 
practice  taking  into 
account  effects  on  HbA1C,  clinical  outcome  and  intolerance  of  higher  dosages  of  metformin.  The 
Applicant decided to
 withdraw this lower strength during the evaluation. 
The  clinical  development  programme  for  the  combination  therapy  comprised  several  trials.  In  total 
3529  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  received  treatment  with  linagliptin  and  metformin  (linagliptin  + 
metformin).  Overall,  2694  patients  were  treated  for  at  least  24  weeks,  2081  patients  for  at  least  52 
weeks, and 1756 patients for more than 78 weeks.  
The  pivotal  placebo-controlled  trial  1218.17  investigated  the  efficacy  of  linagliptin  5  mg  as  add-on 
therapy  to  metformin  over  24  weeks.  In  comparison  to  placebo,  linagliptin  was  associated  with  a 
significant  and  relevant  effect  on  HbA1c.  This  study  was  also  included  in  the  MAA  for  Trajenta 
(linagliptin). 
One active controlled trial was performed in which linagliptin 5 mg was compared with glimepiride (1-4 
mg) in patients treated  with metformin (1218.20). After 10
4 weeks, linagliptin was associated with a 
decrease  in  HbA1c  of  -0.16%,  and  glimepiride  was  associated  with  a  decrease  of  -0.36%.  Non-
inferiority was not reached. The results of this trial are appropriately described in the SmPC.

Studies investigating linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily 
Because the pharmacokinetics of metformin require at least a twice daily dosing, for the development 
of the FDC the once daily dosing of 5 mg linagliptin was split into 2 daily doses of 2.5 mg. This study 
was  performed  on  request  of  the  CHMP.  This  was  a  placebo-controlled  study  over  12  weeks  that 
showed comparable efficacy of the linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily regimen and the linagliptin 5 mg once 
daily  regimen  when  added  to  metformin.  The  difference  in  efficacy  was  negligible  and well  within  the 
non-inferiority boundaries.  
An additional tri
al for the establishment of efficacy of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily was study 1218.46.  
This  study  tested  2  l
inagliptin-metformin  combinations  versus  metformin  in  a  partial  first-line  setting 
(47.5%  treatment-naïve  patients).  The  treatment  effect  in  the  linagliptin-metformin  combination 
therapy groups versus metformin was -0.58% for linagliptin 2.5 mg bid in combination with metformin 
500  mg  vs.  metformin  500  mg.    For  linagliptin  2.5  mg  in  combination  with  metformin  1000  mg  vs. 
metformin 1000 mg, the treatment effect was -0.51%. The fact that at least half of the patients were 
not  treated  with  oral  antidiabetic  drugs  before  inclusion in  the study  is not in line  with  the  requested 
indication  for  linagliptin/metformin  in  patients  that  are  insufficiently  controlled  with  metformin  or 
metformin  in  combination  with  SU.  The  inclusion  of  treatment  naive  patients  resulted  in  an 
overestimation of the treatment effects of metformin in this study. Nevertheless, the treatment effects 
of linagliptin were similar in patients that were pre-treated and thos
e that were treatment naive. 
In general, the effects of linagliptin on fasting plasma glucose and treat to target proportions showed a 
pattern that was similar to the effects on HbA1c. 
Combination with SU 
Efficacy  of  linagliptin  5  mg  once  daily  in  combination  with  metformin  and  SU  over  24  weeks  was 
investigated  in  study 
1218.18,  where  linagliptin  5  mg  qd  or  placebo  were  added  to  ongoing  therapy 
with metformin and an SU. This study was also included in the MAA for Trajenta. The treatment effect 
was  clinically  relevant.  However,  the  treatment  effect  o
f  linagliptin  2.5  mg  twice  daily in  combination 
with metformin and SU was not investigated. It is unlikely that SU influences the efficacy and/or safety 
of  linagliptin  2.5  mg.  In  healthy  individuals,  bioequivalence  between  linagliptin  5  mg  once  daily  and 
linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily has been shown. In addition, the efficacy of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily 
was similar to the efficacy of linagliptin 5 m
g once daily in patients on metformin.  
Long term efficacy 
Data  on  long-term  efficacy  of  linagliptin  in  combination  with  metformin  and  SU  is  available  from 
patients  who  completed  study  1218.18  and  continued  into  trial  1218.40.  The  final  results  were 
provided  during  the  evaluation.  HbA1c  levels  remained  reasonably  stable.  Long-term  efficacy  of 
linagliptin with metformin is also studied in new data from patients who 
completed study 1218.17 and 
continued  into  the  open-label  78-week  extension  study  1218.40.  The  decrease  in  Hb
A1c  was 
maintained in the individuals that continued the use of linagliptin with metformin. However, 38.7% of 
the patients using linagliptin in combination with metformin required rescue medication, and 33.8% of 
the  patients  using  linagliptin  in  combination  with  metform
in  and  SU  required  rescue  medication. 
Nevertheless,  it  is  conceivable  that  this  is  explained  by  the  low  threshold  for  the  initiation  of  rescue 
therapy
, the  long study duration and the fact that  the extension trials also allowed entry for patients 
who already received rescue medication in the initial trials.  
Jentadueto 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 115/134
 
 
 
 
Furthermore  long-term  data
  (54  weeks,  interim  analyses)  are  available  from  study  1218.52  (final 
results  were  provided  during  the  evaluation),  which  is  a  double-blind  metformin  monotherapy-
controlled  extension  trial  in  patients  who  completed  the  24-week  treatment  period  of  study  1218.46 
without  requiring  rescue  medication.  Throughout  the  entire  treatment  duration  of  78  weeks,  the 
linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin 1000 mg combination achieved greater reductions in mean HbA1c than 
the metformin 1000 bid group. In addition, the proportion of patients who required rescue medication 
up  to  Week  78  was  lower  in  the  linagliptin  2.5+metformin  1000  bid  group  (12.6%)  than  in  the 
metformin 1000 bid grou
p (22.9%). 
Subgroups 
The efficacy of linagliptin and metformin over metformin could also be shown in relevant subgroups of 
patients. Thus factors such as age, gender, race (White vs. Asian), ethnicity, geographical region, and 
baseline BMI did not have an influence on the treatment effect. The presence of a washout period and 
the  longer  duration  of  the  disease  diabetes  did  negatively  influence  the  treatment  effect  of  the 
linagliptin/metformin combination therapy, but efficacy was acceptable. Interestingly, previous studies 
suggested  that  the  treatment  effect  of  linagliptin  was  lower  in  Whites  than  in  Asians.  However,  the
results  of  study  1218.46  suggest  the  opposite:  the  treatment  effect  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg  twice  daily 
was  smaller  in  Asians  compared  to  Whites  (-0.42%  vs.  -0.65%  in  combination  with  metformin  500 
mg;-0. 39% vs. -0.59% in combination with metformin 1000 mg). 
The number of patients aged 75 years or ab
ove was very low (in the grouping of 1218.17 and 1218.46 
only  24  patients  >75  years  were  included).  During  the  evaluation,  a  study  in  elderly  patients  was 
submitted  (1218.63).  The  estimated  treatment  difference  between  linagliptin  (n=160)  and  placebo 
(n=78),  calculated  as  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24,  was  -0.64% 
(95%  CI  [-0.81;  -0
.48],  p<0.0001),  demonstrating  superiority  of  linagliptin  over  placebo  in  the 
reduction of HbA1c.  
2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Treatment with 5 mg linagliptin once daily in combination with me
tformin resulted in a modest effect 
on  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint  (HbA1c)  with  statistically  significant  reductions  in  HbA1c,  fasting 
plasma glucose and post
prandial glucose.  
The efficacy of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily was similar to the efficacy of linagliptin 5 mg once daily in 
patients on metformin. Efficacy of the combination linagliptin 2.5 mg with metformin is acceptable.  
The  fixed  dose  combination  has  also  not  been  investigated  in  combination  with  SU,  but  this  is 
considered not necessary as efficacy of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily with metformin and SU is likely to 
be similar to that of linagliptin 5 mg once daily with metformin and SU.  
Results of long term studies with a follow up suggest that efficacy is modest, but acceptable. 
A study in elderly patients revealed that linagliptin added to ongoing treatment with glucose lowering 
drugs was superior to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. 
Patients with hepatic impairment were not investigated in sufficient amounts and this is reflected in the 
SmPC.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Generally,  the  analysis  of  safety  is  presented  separately  for  linagliptin  monotherapy,  metformin 
monotherapy,  the  combination  of  linagliptin  +  metformin,  and  the  triple  combination  of  linagliptin  + 
metformin + SU. Since metformin has been in clinical use for some 50 years in the European Union, no 
dedicated  studies  to  assess  the  safety  of  metformin  were  conducted.  However,  information  on 
metformin monotherapy is included in some of the safety analysis sets (SAFs) for the linagliptin mono 
and combination arms. 
For  the  evaluation  of  safety  of  the  linagliptin  +  metformin  combination,  14  clinical  studies  were 
analysed.  The  focus  is  on  the  safety  data  of  the  pivotal  study  1218.17  (SAF-C1)  (n=700)  which 
compared  linagliptin  with  placebo  in  patients  who  took  metformin  as  background  medication  over  24 
weeks. This safety analysis is supp
orted by data from a pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled trials 
that  used  metformin  either  as  background  medication  or  as  study  treatment  (n=1971)  (SAF-C5). 
Additionally, for the establishment of the side effect profile of linagliptin 5 mg + metformin, an analysis 
set (SEA-2, n=1905) was generated that was based on SAF-C5 but considered solely patients who took 
linagliptin 5 mg resulting in an exclusion of 66 patients from study 1218.6 who took linagliptin 10 mg. 
Data on long-term use of the linagliptin + metformin combination is available from the 24 week study 
1218.46  with  its  double-blind  extension  trial  1218.52  to  provide  data  over  78  weeks.  This  is 
supplemented  by  safety  data  from  study  1218.20  that  compared  linagliptin  +  metformin  with
glimepiride + metformin over 104 weeks.  
The safety of the triple combination therapy linagliptin + metformin + SU was evaluated based on the 
pivotal study 1218.18, a 24-week placebo-controlled trial of linagliptin added to background treatment 
of metformin + SU. 
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  were  hypoglycaemia,  hypersensitivity  reactions,  renal  events 
(including laboratory evaluations), hepatic events (including laboratory evaluations), severe cutaneous 
adverse  reactions,  and  pancreatitis.  In  addition,  the  evaluation  of  cardiovascular  risk  potentially 
associated with the use of linagliptin received particular attention. 
Patient exposure  
Overall,  median  exposures  were  similar  between  treatment  groups.  In  the  pooled  metformin 
background studies the planned study durations ranged from 12 weeks (studies 1218.6 and 1218.62) 
to  24  weeks  (studies  1218.17  and  1218.46).  In  the  active-controlled  long-term  study  1218.20,  776 
patients  received  linagliptin  +  metformin  and  775  patients  received  linagliptin  +  glimepiride.  The 
planned  study  duration  was  104  weeks.  A  large  proportion  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups 
(linagliptin  +  metformin  80.5%,  glimepiride  +  metformin  81.3%)  was  exposed  to  randomised  study 
medication  for  78  weeks  or  more.  The  mean  exposure  was  comparable:  627  days  (linagliptin  + 
metformin)  and  625  days  (glimepiride  +  metformin).  A
dditionally, long-term  safety  (n=567)  included 
patients who completed the 24 weeks of study 1218.46, did not use rescue medication, and continued 
in  the  double-blind  extension  (study  1218.52).  The  planned  treatment  duration  of  the  extension  trial 
was  54  weeks.  At  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis  about  50%  of  patients  had  been  treated  in  the 
extension trial for 24 weeks or more.

In
  the  pivotal  trial  (1218.17),  similar proportions  of  patients  in both  treatment  groups  completed  the 
study  (metformin  92.1%,  linagliptin  +  metformin  92.5%).  The  most  frequent  reason  for  premature 
discontinuation  was  refusal  to  continue  medication  (metformin  2.3%,  linagliptin  +  metformin  2.5%), 
foll
owed  by  the  occurrence  of  adverse  events  (1.7%  in  both  treatment  groups).  In  the  pooled 
metformi

The most frequent reasons for premature disconti

linagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  2.9%),  non-compliance  with  study  protocol  (metformin  +  SU

linagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  2.4%),  refusal  to  continue  trial  medication  (metformi

linagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  1.8%),  and  lack  of  efficacy  (metformin  +  SU  1.5%,  linagliptin  + 
metformin + SU 0.3%). 
A
dverse events  
In  the  pivotal  trial  1218.17  (SAF-C1)  the  incidences  of  adverse  events  were  comparable  in  the 
metformin (57.1%) and the linagliptin + metformin group (53.9%) (see table below). The incidence of 
adverse events of severe intensity was slightly higher in the linagliptin + metformin group (1.1% vs. 
2.1%). Conversely the adverse events considered related to study drug by the investigators were more 
frequent  in  the  metformin  group  (11.3%  vs.  7.3%).  The  proportions  of  patients  who  discontinued 
because  of  adverse  events  (2.3%  vs.  1.7%)  were  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  as  was  the 
incidence of serious adverse events (2.8% vs. 3.4%).

The  profile  of  adverse  events  with  the  combination  therapy  with  linagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  was 
consistent with that observed for linagiptin in combination with metformin. Overall, 61.2% (metformin 
+ SU) and 67.3% (linagliptin + metformin + SU) of patients were reported with an adverse event. The 
frequency  of  patients  with  adverse  events  of  severe  intensity  (1.5%  vs.  2.5%),  of  adverse  events 
leading to treatment discontinuation (1.9% vs. 3.2%), and of adverse events of special interest (0.4% 
vs.  1.3%)  were  generally  low  but  slightly  lower  in  the  metformin  +  SU  than  in  the  linagliptin  + 
metformin + SU groups. The incidence of serious adverse events was comparable between treatment 
groups  (metformin  +  SU  4.2%  vs.  linagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  3.2%).  The  percentage  of  patients 
with drug-related adverse events was higher in the linagliptin + metformin + SU group (18.3%) than 
in  the  metformin  +  SU  group  (12.2%).  This
  was  mainly  due  to  a  higher  incidence  of  hypoglycemia 
(metformin + SU 7.6% vs.
 linagliptin + metformin+ SU 14.5%). Due to the mode of action of insulin 
secretagogues such as SUs, patients on combination therapy are known to be at risk of hypoglycaemic 
events.  
Clinical laboratory evaluation and vital signs  
In  general,  no  clinically  relevant  findings  or  significant  differences  between  linagliptin  and  control 
groups were observed for any of the measured parameters. In the trials with a duration shorter than 
24  weeks,  there  were  no  changes  in  amylase  levels.  A  comparison  of  changes  in  amylase  values 
(normalized reference range: 30-110 U/L) over a 72 week period in patients dosed continuously with 
either  metformin  1000  mg  twice  daily,  linagliptin  2.5  mg  plus  metformin  500  mg  twice  daily,  or 
linagliptin  2.5  mg  plus  metformin  1000  mg  twice  daily  reveals  that  at  week  12  the  mean  differences 
from  baseline  were  5.7,  5.1,  and  9.9 U/L  respectiv
ely.  Fluctuations  in  amylase  values  were  noted  at 
subsequent time points, but ultimately the differences from baseline at week 78 were similar to those 
at weeks 12 and 24 (mea
n 2.1, 3.8, and 8.6 U/L respectively).   
Blood pressure and pulse rates at baseline were comparable between treatment groups. Over the 24-
week  treatment  period  only  minimal  changes  in  mean  values  were  observed  both  treatment  groups 
(<1 mmHg for blood pressure and <1 bpm for pulse rate).

Hypoglycaemic events 
The  analysis  of  hypoglycaemic  events  was  based  on  investigator-reporting.  In  the  pivotal  study 
1218.17,  the  incidence  of  hypoglycaem
ia  was  higher  in  the  metformin  group  (2.8%)  than  in  the 
linagliptin + metformin group (0.6%) and this was corroborated in the set of all metformin-controlled 
studies SAF-C5 (metformin 2.5% vs. linagliptin + metformin 1.4%). As shown by the analysis of trial 
1218.18, the addition of an SU to metformin led to a substantially higher frequency of hypoglycaemic 
events (16.0%) which was even higher in the triple combination group 
of linagliptin + metformin + SU 
(23.7%).  In  trial  1218.20,  the  difference  between  both  treatment  groups  in  hypoglycaemic  events 
(linagliptin  +  metf
ormin  7.5%  vs.  glimepiride  +  metformin  36.1%)  was  significant  and  in  favour  of 
linagliptin  (p<0.0001).  The  majority  of  patients  in  all  SAFs  did  not  require  assistance  in  case  of  a 
hypoglycaemic  episode,  and  large  proportions  of  patients  in  all  SAFs  had  an  onset  of  a  first  episode 
after  28  days.  With  combination  therapy  of  linagliptin  +  metformin  only  1  patient  had  a  severe 
hypoglycaemic  event  (requiring  assistance)  during  long-term  treatment.  However,  in  the  triple 
combination  of  linagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  the  incidence  also  of  severe  hypoglycaemic  events 
appears to be increased. 
Pancreatic disorders  
In  total,  10  cases  of  pancreas  disorders  were  reported:  8  cases  occurring  during  treatment  with 
linagliptin  +  metformin,  and  2  cases  during  treatment  with  glimepiride  +  metformin.  In  the  post-
treatment  period,  2  cases  of  pancreas  disorders  were  reported.  None  of  the  cases  has  been 
necrotising,  haemorrhagic,  or  fatal.  All  of  these  cases  but  one  (on  patient  in  trial  1218.20  with 
pancreatic  carcinoma)  were  included  in  the  linagliptin  monotherapy  SCS.  In  clinical  trials  with 
linagliptin  in  combination  with  metformin,  the  incidence  rate  per  1000  patient-years  in  3463  patients 
was  1.4.  When  the  linagliptin  plus  metformin  combination  was  compared  to  placebo  plus  metformin, 
the incidence rate per 1000 patient-years in 1322 patients treated with linagliptin plus metformin was 
2.0. No events of pancreatitis were reported in the placebo plus metformin cohort of 483 patients. The 
incidence rate of pancreatitis for linagliptin plus metformin is similar to the data found in the linagliptin 
monotherapy  development  program.  The  risk  of  pancreatitis  associated  with linagliptin  treatment  has 
been added in section 4.4 of the Jentadueto SmPC. 
Cardiovascular safety 
Eight trials with a total of 5239 patients with T2DM were included in a cardiovascular meta-analysis in 
the  MAA  for  Trajenta  (linagliptin).  The  primary  endpoint  was  based  on  adjudicated  events  and  was  a 
composite  endpoint  consisting  of  cardiovascula
r  death  (including  fatal  stroke  and  fatal  MI),  non-fatal 
MI, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalisation due to unstable angina. This analysis indicated that treatment 
with  linagliptin  was  not  associated  with  an  increased  cardiovascular  risk  compared  with  a  pooled 
comparator  group.  However,  linagliptin  in  combination  with  metformin  was  associated  with  angina 
pectoris (4 vs. 0 patients) and myoca
rdial ischaemia (2 vs 0 patients). Linagliptin was not associated 
with an increase in CV risk, and the primary endpoint for linagliptin was significantly lower than for the 
total comparators, so this may be a chance finding.

Safety in special popula
tions 
Patients at high cardiovascular risk 
A  cardiovascular  outcome  study  (study  1218.74)  is  currently  ongoing.  Patients  are  planned  to  be 
treated  with  randomised  study  medication  for  up  to  400  weeks  (i.e.  8  years),  an  interim  analysis  is 
planned to be performed based on a number of at least 80 adjudicated primary outcome events and a 
minimum duration of 1.5 years after randomisation of the first patient. 
Elderly patients 
Elderly  patients  might  be  at  a  higher  risk  of  cardiovascular  events.  During  the  evaluation,  a  study  in 
elderly  patients  was  submitted  (study  1218.63),  where  only  patients  of  at  least  70  years  of  age  are 
included. Overall, 60 patients (75.9%) were reported with AEs in the placebo group and 123 patients 
(75.9%)  were  reported  with  AEs  in  the  linagliptin  group.  The  majority  of  the  AEs  were  of  mild  or 
moderate  intensity.  Severe  AEs  were  reported  for  3  patients  (3.8%)  treated  with  placebo  and  9 
patients  (5.6%)  treated  with  linagliptin.  Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  were  reported  for  5  patients 
(6.3%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  14  patients  (8.6%)  in  the  linagliptin  group.  No  patients  died  during 
the study. Two patients, both in the linagliptin group, had confirmed cardiac or cerebrovascular events 
adjudicated by the CEC. One patient had a non-fatal ischaemic stroke, and 1 patient was hospitalised 
due to coronary artery disease (unstable angina). None of the SAEs were considered drug-related. No 
patients  ag
ed  >75  years  had  severe  hypoglycaemia.  The  proportion  of  patients  reported  with 
investigator-defined hypoglycaemia by age group was similar for the two treatment groups in patients 
younger than 75 years of age (23.3% placebo; 25.3% linagliptin), but was lower in the placebo group 
in  patients  aged  75  years  or  older  (8.3%  placebo;  22.5%  linagliptin).  Logistic  regression  of  the 
occurrence  of  hypoglycaemia  indicated  that  treatment  g
roup  was  not  associated  with  a  significant 
difference in the odds of having a hypoglycaemic event (odds ratio 1.577, p = 0.2083). Age was not a 
significant  factor  (odds  ratio  1.490,  p  =  0.2414),  whereas  background  anti-diabetes  medication 
(particularly  SU  and  insu
lin)  was  significant  (p  =  0.0005).  In  this  study  in  elderly  individuals,  it  was 
also noted that more patients in the linagliptin group had increase in amylase compared to the placebo 
SmPC.  One  case  with  contact  dermatitis  was  reported
group  (3.2%  versus  1.3%).  Increase  in  amylase  levels  is  included  in  section  4.8  of  the  Jentadueto 
  but  it  was  not  clear  whether  the  event  was 
nd  causality  between  this  event  and  study  drug  has  not  been 
contact  dermatitis  or  urticaria,  a
established.  
2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of the safety of linagliptin and linagliptin/ metformin FDC for the treatment of patients 
with  T2DM  was  based  on  6  phase  I  studies,  2  phase  II  studies,  and  6  phase  III  studies.  Data  were 
analysed in several study groupings. 
Analysis  of  the  safety  of  linagliptin  with  metformin  combination  therapy  was  initially  based  on  the 
pivotal studies (study 1218.17). This analysis was compared with data obtained from a pooled analysis 
of all metformin-controlled trials.

Most frequent adverse events 
In  the  pivotal  study,  the  most  frequent  adverse  events  were  infections  and  infestations. 
Gastrointestinal  disorders  also  occurred  with  almost  identical  incidences  in  both  treatment  groups. 
Differences  of  2%  or  more  were  observed  for  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  which 
were  more  frequent  in  the  linagliptin  +  metformin  group.  Also  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were more frequent in the linagliptin 
+ metformin group. Conversely, metabolism and nutrition disorders were su
bstantially less frequent in 
the  linagliptin  +  metformin  group  than  in  the  metformin  group  mainly  due  to  a  lower  incidence  of 
hyperglycaemia.  Also  hypoglycaemia  was  less  frequent  with  linagliptin  +  metformin  combination 
therapy  than  with  metformin  alone.  Furthermore,  investigations  and  psychiatric  disorders  were  less 
frequent  with  the  combination  therapy  than  in  the  metformin  group.  The  comparison  of  the  adverse 
event incidences in the pivotal trial with the incidences in the pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled 
trials  with  metformin  background  indicated  a  similar  safety  profile  of  the  linagliptin  +  metformin 
combination. The observed adverse events profile is in accordance with the s
afety profile of individual 
components  such  as  gastrointestinal  disorders  (e.g.  decreased  appetite,  nausea,  vomiting,  and 
diarrhoea)  and  pruritus  associated  with  metformin;  and  nasopharyngitis,  hypersensitivity,  cough,  and 
pancreatitis with linagliptin linagliptin. Hypoglycemia is identified as a side effect only when linagliptin 
and  metformin  are  combined  with  sulfonylureas.  This  is  addressed  in  sections  4.2  and  4.4  of  the 
SmPC. 
Subgroups 
The  analysis  of  the  safety  by  relevant  subgroups  indicated  that  the  safety  profile  of  the  linagliptin 
metformin  combination  was  not  influenced  by  age,  gender,  race  (White  and  Asian),  ethnicity, 
geographic region, renal im
pairment, or metformin dose. 
The  number  of  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  was
  too  low  to  yield  any  relevant  information  in  a 
subgroup  analysis;  these  patients  should  not  be  treated  wi
th  linagliptin.  This  issue  is  sufficiently 
addressed in the SmPC. 
The assessment of safety in the study in elderly patients (1218.63) did not reveal any major concerns 
for treatment with linagliptin in the elderly population. 
Adverse events of special interest 
A comparison of changes in amylas
e values (normalized reference range: 30-110 U/L) over a 72 week 
period  in  patients  dosed  continuously  with  either  metformin  1000  mg  twi
ce  daily,  linagliptin  2.5  mg 
plus metformin 500 mg twice daily, or linagliptin 2.5 mg plus metformin 
1000 mg twice daily reveals 
that  at  week  12  the  mean  differences  from  baseline  were  5.7,  5.1,  and  9.9  U/L  respectively. 
Fluctuations  in  amylase  values  were  noted  at  subsequent  time  points,  but  ultimately  the  differences 
from  baseline  at  week  78  were  similar  to  those  at  weeks  12  and  24  (mean  2.1,  3.8,  and  8.6  U/L 
respectively). In the study in elderly individuals, it was also noted that more pat
ients in the linagliptin 
group had increase in amylase compared to the placebo group. Increase in amylase levels is included 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC. In t
otal, 10 cases of pancreas disorders were reported. Although none of 
the cases has been necrotising, haemorrhagic, or fatal, this is an important issue. In clinical trials with 
linagliptin  (used  in  combination  with  metformin),  the  incidence  rate  per  1000  patient-years  in  3463 
patients  was  1.4.  When  the  linagliptin  plus  metformin  combination  was  compared  to  placebo  plus 
metformin,  the  incidence  rate  per  1000  patient-years  in  1322  patients  treated  with  linagliptin  plus 
metformin  was  2.0.  No  events  of  pancreatitis  were  report
ed  in  the  placebo  plus  metformin  cohort  of 
483  patients.  The  incidence  rate  of  pancreatitis  for  linagliptin  plus  metformin  is  similar  to  the  data 
found  in  the  linagliptin  monotherapy  development  program.  The  risk  of  pancreatitis  is  appropriately 
covered in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Photosensitivity  reactions  were  reported  by  4  patien
ts:  3  cases  occurring  during  treatment  with 
linagliptin + metfo
rmin
 and 1 case during treatment with
 m
etformin. None of the events was serious,
 1 
event  was  considered
  drug-related.  Angioedem
a  was  rep
orted  by  2  patients  during
  treatment  with 
linagliptin  +  metformi
n;  one  event
  was  serious,  both  events  were  not  assessed  as  drug-related. 
Regarding AE of special interest one case with contact dermatitis was reported in the study in elderly 
patients. However, it was no
t clear whether the event was contact dermatitis or urticaria, and causality 
between this eve
nt and
 study drug has not been establi
she
d. 
As  for  linagliptin  mono
therapy,  linagliptin  in  combina
tion 
with  metform
in  was  associated  with  angina 
pectoris  (4  vs.  0  pati
ents) 
and  myocardial  ischaemia  (2
  vs  0  patients).  Although  a  formal
  meta-
analysis  of  all  randomised  linagliptin  studies  demonstrat
ed  that  linagliptin  was  not  associated  w
ith 
cardiovascular  risk,  cardiovascular  safety  remains  an  im
portant  issue  and  is  included  as
  important 
missing  information  in  the  RMP.  Higher  frequencies  of  hypertension  (0.1%)  and  hypertensive  crisis 
(0.1%)  were  observed  in  the  linagliptin  group.  A  CV  outcome  study  (study  1218.74)  is  currently 
ongoing. The results of this study will be submitted to the 
CHMP for review.  
A  higher  incidence  of  infections  has  been  described  w
ith  other  DPP-4  inhibitors.  The 
long-term 
consequences of DPP-4 inhibition and its effects on other DPP-4 substrates, particularly with respect to 
immune  function,  are  unknown.  Although  the  incidence 
of  infections
  with  linagliptin  was  similar  to 
placebo (19.1% vs. 20.6%) and linagliptin was not associ
ated with a decrease in absolute lym
phocyte 
count, it is important  to  realize  that  these  observations  w
ere  done  in  relatively  sh

s on the clinical safety 
Overall, in the phase I
II stud
ies the incidence of adverse 
events was v
ery similar across studies, with 
linagliptin  being  mostly  comparable  to  placebo  and  active
  comparator  groups.  In  general,  the  safe
ty 
profile  appears  comparable  with  other  DPP-4  inhibitors.
  Adverse  events  are  not  different
  between 
linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily and linagliptin 5 mg once dai

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilan
ce system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  descri
bed  by  the  appli
cant  fulfills  the 
legislative  requirements  and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a 
qualified person responsible for Pharmacovigilance and ha
s the necessary means for the notificati
on of 
any adverse reaction suspected to occur either in the Unio
n or in a third country. 
Risk Management Plan 
The applicant submitted a risk management plan (version
 4.0, dated 15 May 2012), which is b
ased on 
the  RMP  for  the  single  component  linagliptin  (Trajenta)  and  complemented  with  relevant  safety 
information for metformin. The identified and potentials ris
ks and the areas of missing inform
ation that 
are proposed by the applicant are considered acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Linagliptin is a selective, orally administered, xanthine-based DPP-4 inhibitor 
that lowers blood glucose 
levels by augmenting the glucose-stimulated insulin release through GLP-1. Linagliptin 5 mg has been 
approved  in  the  EU  as  Trajenta  in  combination  with  metformin  and  metformin
  plus  sulphonylurea.  In 
addition,  linagliptin  5  mg  has  been  approved  for  use  as  monotherapy  in  patients  inadequately 
controlled  by  diet  and  exercise  alone and  for  whom metformin  is inappropriate  due  to  intolerance,  or 
contraindicated due to renal impairment.  
For  other  DPP-4  inhibitors  sitagliptin  (Januvia),  vildagliptin  (Galvus)  and  saxagliptin  (Onglyza),  fixed 
dose  combinations  with  metformin  (Janumet,  Eucras  and  Komboglyze,  respectively)  have  previously 
been approved in the European Union. 
Because the pharmacokinetics of metformin require an at least twice daily dosing, for the development 
of the FDC the once daily dosing of 5 mg linagliptin (which is the posology of Trajenta) was split into 2 
daily  doses  of  2.5  mg.  In  healthy  individuals,  linagliptin  2.5  mg  twice  daily  was  bioequivalent  to 
linagliptin  5  mg  once  daily  with  respect  to  the  exposure  data  over  24  hours  AUC0-24  hours  and  DPP-4 
inhibition  (study  1218.47).  In  its  Scientific  Advice  from  2008,  the  CHMP  requested  a  clinical  study  to 
show equivalence of twice daily dosing of linagliptin 2.5 mg with once daily dosing of linagliptin 5 mg 
(EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/472394/2008). Therefore, new clinical data were submitted. Study 1218.62 was a 
placebo-controlled  study  over  12  weeks  that  showed  comparable  efficacy  of  the  linagliptin  2.5  mg 
twice daily regimen and the linagliptin 5 mg once daily regimen when added to metformin.  
An  additional  phase  III  study  for  the  establishment  of  efficacy  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg  twice  daily  was 
study 1218.46.  This study tested 2 linagliptin 2.5 mg-metformin combinations versus metformin. The 
combination of linagliptin with metformin 500 mg twice daily as well as with metformin 1000 mg twice 
daily demonstrated a relevant effect on HbA1c in comparison to metformin only.  
The efficacy of linagliptin and metformin over metformin could also be shown in relevant subgroups of 
patients.  Factors  such  as  age,  gender,  race  (White  vs.  Asian),  e
thnicity,  geographical  region,  and 
baseline BMI did not have an influence on the treatment effect. Furthermore, the presence of washout 
of prior OADs and the time since diagnosis of diabetes did
 negatively influence the treatment effect of 
linagliptin metformin combination therapy, but efficacy was acceptable. 
The clinical study in elderly patients (>70 years) showed that the glucose lowering effect of linagliptin 
in the elderly population is similar to that in younger patients.

Most  clin
ical  studies  in  the  application  dossier  were  conducted  with  linagliptin  2.5  mg  tablets  in 
combination with metformin tablets (1000 mg, 500 mg and 850 mg tablets). The Applicant conducted 
three bioequivalence studies (
studies 1288.1,1288.2 and 1288.3) with the to be registered FDC tablets 
to  justify  the  extrapolation  of  the  results  of  the  studies  performed  with  the  mono  components  to  the 
FDC tablets. Based on the bioequivalence studies linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg, linagliptin 2.5 
mg/metformin 850 mg, linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg can be considered bioequivalent with the 
single dose formulation with linagliptin 2.5mg tablet and EU Glucophage 1000 mg, 500 mg and 850 mg 
respectively. 
Justification for the linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg strength was requested by the CHMP on the 
basis  of  the  clinical  data  of  Je
ntadueto  and  of  the  use  of  metformin  500  mg  bid  in  clinical  practice 
taking into account effects on HbA1C, clinical outcome and intolerance of higher dosages of metformin. 
The Applicant decided to withdraw this lower strength during the evaluation. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  treatment  effect  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg  twice  daily  in  combination  with  metformin  as  dual 
combination  therapy  was  investigated.  The  triple  combination  of
  linagliptin  2.5  mg  twice  daily  in 
combination with metformin and SU was not investigated as such.  
Long term efficacy of linagliptin was investigated in several trials. First, linagliptin 5 mg in combination 
with metformin or metformin with SU was investigated in study 1218.40, the open-label extension of 
studies  1218.17  and  1218.18.  Interim  analyses  were  presented  with  this  application.  New  interim 
analyses  provided  efficacy  data  for  linagliptin  over  up  to  102  weeks.  The  decrease  in  HbA1c  was 
maintained in the individuals that continued the use of linagliptin with metformin. However, 38.7% of 
the patients using linagliptin in combination with metformin required rescue medication, and 33.8% of 
the  patients  using  linagliptin  in  combination  with  metformin  and  SU  required  rescue  medication.  The 
relatively large proportion of patients requiring rescue medication in the extension trials in comparison 
to the initial trials was a concern. However, it is conceivable that this is explained by the low threshold 
for the initiation of rescue therapy, the long study duration and the fact that the extension trials also 
allowed  entry  for  patients  who  already  received  rescue  medication  in  the  initial  trials.  Second,  long-
term  data  (78  weeks)  are  available  from  study  1218.52,  which  is  a  double-blind  metformin 
monotherapy-controlled  extension  trial  in  patients  who  completed  the  24-week  treatment  period  of 
study  1218.46  without  requiring  rescue  medication.  In  the  extension  study,
  up  to  54  weeks,  mean 
HbA1c levels remained fairly stable in all 3 treatment groups. Throughout the entire treatment duration 
of 78 weeks, the linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin 1000 mg combination achieved greater reductions in 
mean  HbA 1c  than  the  metformin  1000  mg  bid  g
required  rescue  medication  up  to  Week  78  was  lower  in  the  linagliptin  2.5  +  metformin1000  mg  bid 
roup.  In  addition,  the  proportion  of  patients  who 
group (12.6%) than in the metformin 1000 mg bid group (22.9%). 
The amount of patients with hepatic impairment was low. 
Factors such as age, gender, race (White vs. Asian), ethnicity, geographical region, and baseline BMI 
did  not  have  an  influence  on  the  treatment  effect.  The  results  with  respect  to  race  were  divergent 
Previous studies suggested that the treatment effect of linagliptin was lower in Whites than in Asians, 
while  the  results  of  study
  1218.46  suggest  the  opposite:  the  treatment  effect  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg 
twice daily was smaller in Asians compared to Whites (-0.42% vs. -0.65%, respectively in combination 
with metformin 500 mg;-0. 39% vs. -0.59% respectively in combination with metformin 1000 mg).

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall,  in  the  phase  III  studies  the  overall  incidence  of  adverse  events  were  very  similar  across 
studies,  with  linagliptin  bei
ng  mostly  comparable  to  placebo  and  active  comparator  groups.  The 
observed adverse events profile is in accordance with the safety profile of individual components such 
as gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., decreased appetite, nausea, vomiti
ng, and diarrhoea) and pruritus 
associated  with  metformin;  and  nasopharyngitis,  hypersensitivity,  cough,  and  pancreatitis  for 
linagliptin.  Hypoglycaemia  is  identified  as  a  side  effect  only  when  linagliptin  and  metformin  are 
combined with sulfonylureas.  
It  is  well  known  that  metformin  is  contraindicated  for  patients  with  GFR  below  60  ml/min.  This 
contraindication is also applicable for metformin in combination with linagliptin.  
The  analysis  of  the  safety  by  relevant  subgroups  indicated  that  the  safety  profile  of  the 
linagliptin/metformin  combination  was  not  influenced  by  age,  gender,  race  (White  and  Asian), 
ethnicity, geographic region, renal impairment, or metformin dose. 
A comparison of changes in amylase values over a 72 week period in patients dosed continuously with 
either  metformin  1000  mg  twice  daily,  linagliptin  2.5  mg  plus  metformin  500  mg  twice  daily,  or 
linagliptin  2.5  mg  plus  metformin  1000  mg  twice  daily  reveals  that  at  week  12  the  mean  differences 
from  baseline  were  5.7,  5.1,  and  9.9  U/L  respectively.  Fluctuations  in  amylase  values  were  noted  at 
subsequent time points, but ultimately the differences from baseline at week 78 were similar to those 
at  weeks  12  an
d  24  (mean  2.1,  3.8,  and  8.6  U/L  respectively).  In  the  study  in  elderly  individuals,  it 
was  also  noted  that  more  patients  in  the  linagliptin  group  had  increase  in  amylase  compared  to  the 
placebo  group.  This  increase  in  amylase  levels  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  In  total,  10  cases  of 
pancreas disorders were reported. Although none of the cases has been necrotising, haemorrhagic, or 
fatal,  this  is  an  important  issue.  When  the  linagliptin  plus  metformin  combination  was  compared  to 
placebo  plus  metformin,  the  incidence  rate  per  1000  patient-years  in  1322  patients  treated  with 
linagliptin  plus  metformin  was  2.0.  No  events  of  pancreatitis  were  reported  in  the  placebo  plus 
metformin  cohort  of  483  patients.  Th
e  incidence  rate  of  pancreatitis  for  linagliptin  plus  metformin  is 
similar to the data found in the linagliptin monotherapy development program. The risk of pancreatitis 
has been added to paragraph 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”. 
The  Safety  analyses  of  the  study  in  elderly  patients  revealed  no  new  unexpected  safety  issues.  The 
overall rate of AEs was higher than in most previous clinical trials with linagliptin, but the differences 
between placebo and treatment group were small. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Photosensitivity  reactions  were  reported  by  4  patients:  3  cases  occurring  during  treatment  with 
linagliptin + metformin and 1 case during treatment with metformin. None of the events was serious, 1 
event  was  considered  drug-related.  Angioedema  was  reported  by  2  patients  during  treatment  with 
linagliptin + metformin; one event was serious, bo
th events were not assessed as drug-related. Long 
term effects are unclear.  
Angina  pectoris  (4  vs.  0  patients)  and  myocardial  ischaemia  (2  vs  0  patients)  were  associated  with 
linaglip
tin  treatment  in  combination  with  metformin.  A  formal  meta-analysis  of  all  randomised 
linagliptin  studies  was  submitted.  This  meta-analysis  demonstrated  that  overall  linagliptin  was  not 
associated  with  cardiovascular  risk.  Somewhat  higher  frequencies  of  hypertension  and  hypertensive 
crisis were observed in the linagliptin group.

A  higher  incidence  of  infections  has  been  described  with  other  DPP-4  inhibitors.  The  long-term 
consequences of DPP-IV inhibition and its effects on other DPP-IV substrates, particularly with respect 
to  immune  function,  are  unknown.  It  is  important  to  realize  that  these  observations  were  do
ne  in 
relatively short term trials.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important favourable effect of linagliptin were added to treatment with metformin is lowering 
of HbA1c. This effect is relatively small in comparison to the effects of other drug classes, such as GLP-
1  agonists,  insulin  and  SU  preparations.  A  fixed  dose  combination  of  lina
gliptin  and  metformin  was  a 
logical  next  step.  Fixed-dose  combinations  may  decrease  the  risk  of  medication  non-compliance  and 
this may translate into better clinical outcomes. 
The triple combination of linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with metformin and SU was not 
investigated.  This  may  be  a
  problem  if  SU  influences  the  efficacy  and/or  safety  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg 
twice  daily  differently  than  it  influences  linagliptin  5  mg  once  daily,  which  is  unlikely.  In  healthy 
individuals, bioequivalence of the linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin fixed dose combination posology versus 
the  separate  components  has  been  demonstrated.  In  addition,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
efficacy  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg  twice  daily  was  similar  to  the  efficacy  of  linagliptin  5  mg  once  daily  in 
patients on metformin. Therefore the CHMP considered that data submitted which include a linagliptin 
5 mg qd triple combination study sufficiently support the use of Jentadueto in triple combination with a 
sulphonylurea. 
The fact that at least half of the patients were not treated with oral antidiabetic drugs before inclusion 
in  study  1218.46  is  not  in  line  with  the  requested  indication  for  linagliptin/metformin  in  patients  that 
are  insufficiently  controlled  with  metformin  or  metformin  in  combination  with  SU.  The  inclusion  of 
treatment  naive  patients  resulted  in  an  overestimation  of  the  treatment  effects  of  metformin  in  this 
study.  Nevertheless,  the  treatment  effects  of  linagliptin  were  similar  in  patients  that  were  pretreated 
and those that were treatment naive. 
While T2DM is a progressive disease and the long term effects of linagliptin are relatively modest, long-
term  data  from  study  1218.52  demonstrated  that  the  linagliptin  2.5  mg  +  metformin 
1000  mg 
combination  achieved  greater  reductions  in  mean  HbA1c  than  the  metformin  1000  mg  bid  group.  In 
addition,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  required  res
cue  medication  up  to  Week  78  was  lower  in  the 
linagliptin  2.5  +  metformin1000  mg  bid  group  (12.6%)  than  in  the  metformin  1000  mg  bid  group 
(22.9%). 
The increase in amylase levels and the increased risk for p
ancreatitis in the long term are considered 
important  concerns.  The  incidence  rate  of  pancreatitis  for  linagliptin  plus  metformin  is  similar  to  the 
data found in the linagliptin monotherapy development program. Although none of the cases has been 
necrotising, haemorrhagic, or fatal, the risk of pancreatitis has in
cluded in section 4.4 of the SmPC and 
as an important potential risk in the RMP. In line with the SmPC guideline, increase in amylase levels 
has also been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Photosensitivity  reactions  and  ang
ioedema  were  observed  rarely.  Angioedema  (hypersensitivity 
reactions) is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC and is included in the RMP as an important potential 
risk.

A low number of CV events were ob
served with linagliptin in combination with metformin although the 
absolute  numbers  of  CV  events  were  very  low.  This  emphasizes  the  need  for  a  cardiovascular  safety 
study. A CV o
utcome study is currently ongoing (study 1218.74) and is also included in the RMP. 
The possible increased risk of infections and skin reactions and worsening of renal function have been 
included  as  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Long-term  consequences  of  linagliptin  on  immune 
function a
re unknown. If present, this is likely to be a class effect of DPP-IV inhibitors. Immunological 
adverse  reactions  are  included  as  important  missing  information  in  the  RMP  and  will  be  monitored 
closely post marketing.  
Due to its mechanism of action, linagliptin in combination with me
tformin has a relatively low risk for 
hypoglycaemia.  The  low  propensity  of  linagliptin  to  cause  hypoglycaemia  when  compared  to  SU  and 
insulin may be relevant in patients more prone to hypoglycaemic events.  
Furthermore  compared  to  most  in
sulins  and  SU  the  addition  of  linagliptin  to  metformin  does  not 
increase body weight. In an overweight population, this can be considered a valuable advantage. 
Benefit-risk bala
nce 
The  clinical  short  term  effect  of  linagliptin  2.5  mg  with  metformin
  twice  daily  is  comparable  to 
linagliptin 5 mg once daily in combination with metformin. Linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily was shown to 
be bioequivalent to linagliptin 5 mg once daily for
 AUC0-24 hours and DPP-4 inhibition. In addition it has 
been demonstrated that the to be registered linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg and linagliptin 2.5 
mg  /  metformin  850  mg  FDC  tablets  are  bioequivalent  with  the  linagliptin  2.
5  mg  tablet  given 
concomitantly with EU metformin 1000 mg and 850 mg respectively.  
Several  possible  side-effects  were  identified,  but  the  risks  were  in  general  only  mildly  elevated  in 
comparison to placebo and comparators. Cardiovascular risk and pancreatitis are of particular interest. 
A cardiovascular outcome study is currently ongoing and the results will be submitted for the CHMP fo
r 
review (as stated in the RMP). Furthermore, an increased incidence of pancreatitis is of concern, as this 
is a potential serious life threatening disease. The risk of pancreatitis has been included in section 4.4 
of the SmPC and will be further monitored. 
In  conclusion  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefits  outweigh  the  risks  of  Jentadueto  (linagliptin  2.5 
mg/metformin 850 mg and linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg) in the claimed indication. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance
The overall benefit/risk of Jentadueto is considered positive for the indication:  
“Treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
Jentadueto  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  and  exercise  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  adult 
patients inadequately controlled
 on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone, or those already 
being treated with the combination of linagliptin and metformin. 
Jentadueto  is  indicated  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  (i.e.  triple  combination  therapy)  as  an 
adjunct to diet a
nd exercise in adult patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose 
of metformin and a sulphonylurea.”

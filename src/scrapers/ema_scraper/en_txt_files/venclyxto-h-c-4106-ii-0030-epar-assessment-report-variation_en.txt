2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematologic stem-cell malignancy characterised by the 
clonal expansion of myeloblasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and occasionally extramedullary 
tissues, disrupting normal hematopoiesis.  
Noteworthy, more than 50% of AML patients are considered ineligible for intensive chemotherapy 
regimens due to age, performance status and/or comorbid conditions.  
Claimed therapeutic indication 
Venclyxto (venetoclax) in combination with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (NDAML) who are 
ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.  
Epidemiology  
The median age at diagnosis of AML is 68 years of age. The incidence is increasing as the population 
ages. In Europe, the annual incidence is 5-8 per 100,000 in adults, which triples to 15-25 per 100,000 in 
those over 70 years of age.  
Biologic features 
Less than 10% of patients > 65 are alive 5 years after the diagnosis, while the life expectancy in a 
normal population is 15 to 20 additional years. The reasons for such poor outcomes can be attributed to 
patient- and disease-related features. Older age usually is associated with lower performance status, 
frailty (a syndrome of unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, weakness and decreased physical activity), 
comorbidities and organ impairment leading to more severe toxicities (e.g. severe infections) of intensive, 
remission-oriented, regimens.  
The biological and cytogenetic profile of elderly AML patients do differ from those of younger patients, due 
to a higher incidence of unfavourable cytogenetics (lower frequency of ‘favourable’ NPM1 and FLT3 
mutations, increase of p53 gene mutations, the presence of complex and/or monosomal caryotypes), 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021 
Page 8/132 
 
 
 
 
secondary AML after previous disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative 
neoplasms or following radio-chemotherapy (known as therapy-related AML).  
Indeed, AML in older patients appears to be a biologically and clinically distinct disease with a diminished 
response to induction chemotherapy, lower remission rates, shorter disease-free survival and overall 
survival than observed with younger patients: the 5-year survival rate for patients less than age 65 years 
at diagnosis is 47.5%, while for patients age 65 years and older at diagnosis is approximately 8%.  
Management 
In the 1970s, the ‘7+3’ regimen (7 days of cytarabine and 3 days of anthracycline) became available and 
remains the mainstay of curative-intent standard of care for NDAML. In the last twenty years, new drugs 
such as hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine) have been introduced in the therapeutic arsenal 
for patients considered unfit for standard chemotherapy.  
After a stagnation of decades in the treatment of AML, the recent years witnessed a wave of approvals 
and applications in the US and EU, mostly addressing specific mutations (e.g FLT3 with midostaurin, 
quizartinib, , gilteritinib;, improved formulations of ‘old’ drugs (Vyxeos, liposomal cytarabine and 
daunorubicine at a 5:1 molar ratio), products targeting tumoral antigens (anti-CD33 gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin) or specific pathways (HH/GLI inhibitor glasdegib).Nevertheless, for NDAML patients with or 
without actionable mutations and deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy or for those who refuse it 
despite being eligible, HMAs or LDAC monotherapy are the mainstay of therapy. The prognosis remains 
poor. In this population, the reported median OS was 7.7 months for patients receiving decitabine, 10.4 
months for azacitidine, and 5 months for LDAC, when given as single agents.  
A substantial unmet need exists for ‘middle-ground’ therapies that can provide clinical efficacy translated 
into survival benefits at lower toxicities than standard chemotherapy.

2.1.2.  About the product 
B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL2) family members, including BCL2, BCL-XL and MCL1, mediate cancer 
survival by sequestering pro-apoptotic proteins and BCL2 activity promotes chemotherapy resistance and 
enhances the survival of leukemic progenitor and blast cells. Venetoclax is a potent, highly selective, 
orally bioavailable, small-molecule BCL2 inhibitor. Resistance to venetoclax may be mediated by other 
pro-survival proteins such as BCL-XL and MCL1, that sequester endogenous BH3-only activity proteins 
released by venetoclax upon BCL2 binding. Cytotoxic drugs, including cytarabine, synergize with 
venetoclax by enhancing BH3-only activity and/or suppressing MCL1 to promote apoptosis in preclinical 
models of AML. 
Approved indications for venetoclax: 
Venclyxto in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated CLL. 
Venclyxto in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who 
have received at least one prior therapy. 
Venclyxto monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of CLL: 
in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a 
B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor, 
or

in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both 
chemoimmunotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.

Analytical Methods 
Bioanalysis 
Details of specific and sensitive LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods developed and validated for the 
quantitation of venetoclax in human plasma were provided in the original application. A list of the 
validation reports and analytical method reports for the AML clinical studies are provided in Table 1.  All 
validations were conducted in compliance with internal standard operating procedures of the respective 
laboratories that performed the method validation. During sample analysis, the assay reproducibility was 
demonstrated at least once per assay using an incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) approach (Table 2). 
There was no change in analytical methods for venetoclax assays that was provided in the original 
application.

Table 2. Summary of Analytical Methods 
Population PK analysis 
Data from the 5 clinical studies in AML patients were included in the analysis (M14-358, M14-212, M14-
387, M15-656, M16-043). 
A previously developed non-linear mixed-effects population PK model of venetoclax in relapsed/refractory 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL), and Non-Hodgkin's 
Lymphoma (NHL) subjects and healthy subjects was used as a starting point for the current analysis.  
The population parameter estimates, and the variance-covariance matrix were used as informative priors 
for the analysis presented in this report. The magnitudes of the covariate effects were re-estimated. In 
addition, the effects of race (Asian vs. non-Asian), azacitidine (AZA), decitabine (DEC) and LDAC on 
venetoclax apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment (V2/F), 
and relative bioavailability (F1) were tested as covariates. 
Results 
In total, the population PK analysis included 4,575 plasma venetoclax observations from 771 subjects at 
venetoclax doses ranging from a ramp-up dose of 10 mg to a target dose of 1200 mg (Table 3).  Twenty-
seven (0.6%) concentration records > LLOQ were excluded from analysis.

Table 4. Demographic and Other Covariates Data Summary for Subjects Included in the Population PK Analysis (cont.) 
Co-administration of HMAs (AZA or DEC) and LDAC as well as race (Asian vs. non-Asian) were tested as 
covariates (without any priors) on venetoclax apparent clearance, apparent central volume of distribution, 
and relative bioavailability. The final model included race (Asian vs. non-Asian) as a statistically 
significant covariate on venetoclax relative bioavailability, with Asian subjects having 67% higher relative 
bioavailability, and co-administration of AZA as a statistically significant covariate on venetoclax apparent 
volume of distribution, increasing venetoclax apparent volume of distribution by 24% (Table 5). All 
pharmacokinetic parameters in the model were estimated precisely (RSE < 15%).  Shrinkage of the inter-
individual random effects was moderate (23 to 35%). 
The goodness-of-fit plots do not indicate systematic bias in the observed vs. individual and population 
predicted concentrations for the final model.  Most values lay near the line of identity.  The distributions 
of the conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) with population predicted concentrations and time also do 
not indicate systematic model misspecifications. 
The pcVPC plots of the simulated percentiles overlaid with the observed data showed that the model was 
able to adequately capture the variability of the data (Figure 4). A tendency to under-predict the 5th 
percentile was noted; this was also seen in the previous analysis (R&D/15/0256). However, the central 
tendency and range of observed data was described adequately.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Study M14-358 enrolled 12 subjects in Arm C as part of a drug-drug interaction (DDI) evaluation at a 
single site to assess the safety and PK of venetoclax when co-administered with posaconazole, a strong 
cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A inhibitor (Table 6). Azole antifungals, such as posaconazole, are widely used as 
prophylaxis in AML patients.   
Compared to venetoclax 400 mg administered alone, co-administration of posaconazole with venetoclax 
50 and 100 mg resulted in 61% and 86% higher venetoclax Cmax, respectively.  The venetoclax AUC24 
was 90% and 144% higher, respectively (Table 7).

The objective of the PKPD modelling analysis was to evaluate the relationship between venetoclax 
exposures and clinical response (efficacy and safety) in subjects with AML, with separate analyses for 
venetoclax in combination with hypomethylating agents (HMA) (VEN + HMA) and for venetoclax in 
combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) (VEN + LDAC), Table 8:

Table 8. Dose and combination treatment information for Subjects Included in the Exposure-Response 
Analyses 
For the exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses, the predictor variable was venetoclax exposure 
expressed as the steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCss). AUCssfor each 
subject was calculated using the designated cohort dose as well as the individual apparent clearance 
(CL/F) and relative bioavailability (F1) of venetoclax estimated using the final population PK model.  Data 
from subjects taking placebo were included in exposure-response analyses to inform the intercept (i.e., at 
zero concentrations of venetoclax). The relationships between venetoclax exposures and each of the 
response variables for efficacy or safety were evaluated graphically by quartile plots or Kaplan-Meier 
plots.  Cox proportional hazards (CPH) and logistic regression analyses were performed using efficacy and 
safety data from Studies M14-358 and M15-656 (VEN/PBO + HMA) or Studies M14-387 and M16-043 
(VEN/PBO + LDAC). Separate exposure-response (ER) analyses were conducted for VEN + HMA 
(StudiesM14-358 and M15-656) and VEN + LDAC (Studies M14-387 and M16-043).  Covariate selection 
was performed using step-wise forward addition and backward elimination procedure with significance 
levels of α = 0.01 and α = 0.001, respectively. The covariates tested for influence on exposure-efficacy 
and exposure-safety relationships included the following: 
•  Sex (Male, Female) 
•  Age (18 – 64 years, 65 – 74 years, ≥ 75 years) 
•  Race (Asian vs. non-Asian) 
•  ≥ 7 consecutive days of moderate/strong CYP3A or P-gp inhibitors (Yes, No) 
•  Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 - 1, ≥ 2) 
•  Subjects who received prior HMA for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Yes, No) 
•  Cytogenetic risk categorization (Favorable, Intermediate, Poor, Missing) 
•  Molecular markers (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2), 
tumor protein p53 (TP53), nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1); Not detected, Detected, Missing) 
•  AML with myelodysplasia related changes (AML-MRC; Yes, No, Missing) 
•  AML Type (De Novo, Secondary) 
Additionally, the following covariate was tested for VEN + HMA: 
• 
Impact of individual HMAs (AZA vs. DEC) 
In the exposure-safety analyses, the following covariates were also tested: 
•  Baseline platelet count for treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia

•  Baseline neutrophil count for treatment- emergent Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia 
Covariates were only assessed if > 50% of all subjects included in the exposure-response (ER) analyses 
had non-missing values. 
Venetoclax in Combination with Hypomethylating Agents 
A total of 575 subjects (431 subjects with VEN + HMA and 144 with PBO + HMA) were included in the 
exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses for VEN + HMA.  A total of 437 subjects (293 subjects 
with VEN + HMA and 144 with PBO + HMA) from the Phase 3 Study M15-656 were included in the 
analysis of EFS (event-free survival).  A total of 156 and 310 subjects who were transfusion dependent at 
baseline were included in the analyses of conversion to post baseline transfusion independence for 
platelets and RBCs, respectively. 
Exposure-efficacy (VEN+HMA) 
Response rates from combination therapy (VEN + HMA) were compared to those of the PBO + HMA arm 
from Study M15-656 (i.e., at zero concentrations of venetoclax). Results of the logistic regression 
analysis are illustrated in Figure 9 for the exposure metric AUCss, showing that there is a statistically 
significant exposure-response relationship (P < 0.01) between venetoclax exposure and the probability of 
response of CR + CRi and CR + CRh. The parameters of the logistic regression model are presented in 
Table 9.  Although the data for achieving CR appear to follow the same trend, the Emax model did not 
converge with stable parameter estimates and the linear model did not adequately capture the trend of 
the data. Covariate analysis identified that subjects with intermediate cytogenetic risk had a higher 
probability of achieving CR + CRi than those subjects with poor risk regardless of venetoclax exposures.

A clear trend for increased survival in subjects taking venetoclax was observed compared to those taking 
placebo, but within the venetoclax exposure quartiles, no clear exposure-response trend was observed.  
Results from the CPH model identified statistically significant (P < 0.01) exposure-response relationships 
between higher venetoclax exposures and better survival outcomes for OS and EFS (Table 10). 
Table 10. Parameter Estimates of the Cox Proportional Hazards Models for Venetoclax in Combination 
with HMA 
A trend for higher rates of conversion to post baseline platelet and RBC transfusion independence for 
subjects on VEN + HMA was observed as compared to those subjects on PBO + HMA.  Both Emax and 
linear regression models were fit to the data, but the Emax model did not converge with stable parameter 
estimates and the linear model did not adequately capture the trend of the data. Analyses excluding the 
placebo subjects showed no significant exposure-response relationship between venetoclax exposures 
and probability of conversion to transfusion independence (P = 0.53 and P = 0.71 for platelets and RBCs, 
respectively). 
Exposure-safety (VEN+HMA)

The parameters of the logistic regression model (rates of occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade≥ 3 
neutropenia in combination therapy (VEN + HMA) were compared to those of the PBO + HMA arm from 
Study M15-656), showing a statistically significant exposure-response relationship (P < 0.01), for the 
analyses of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia are presented in Table 11.  Covariate analysis 
identified that Asian subjects were more likely to have treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, 
including subjects taking PBO + HMA.  The magnitude of venetoclax effect was however similar in Asian 
and non-Asian subjects.  Model predicted incidence shows that subjects taking VEN + HMA had 
approximately 20 - 25% higher probability of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia compared to 
subjects taking PBO + HMA for both Asian and non-Asian subjects, further indicating that this is an effect 
that is not specific to venetoclax treatment 
No apparent relationship between venetoclax exposure and occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 
infections was observed.  Both Emax and linear regression models were fit to the data, but the Emax 
model did not converge with stable parameter estimates and the linear model did not adequately capture 
the trend of the data. Rates of occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 infections vs Cavg quartiles 
also showed no apparent relationship. 
No apparent relationship between venetoclax exposure and occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 
thrombocytopenia was observed.  Both Emax and linear regression models were fit to the data, but the 
Emax model did not converge with stable parameter estimates and the linear model did not adequately 
capture the trend of the data. Rates of occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia 
vs Cavg quartiles also showed no apparent relationship.

Venetoclax in Combination with Low-Dose Cytarabine 
A total of 279 subjects (211 with VEN + LDAC and 68 with PBO + LDAC) were included in the exposure-
efficacy and exposure-safety analyses for VEN + LDAC.  A total of 210 subjects (142 subjects with VEN + 
LDAC and 68 subjects with PBO + LDAC) from the Phase 3 Study M16-043 were included in the analysis 
of EFS.  A total of 96 and 205 subjects who were transfusion dependent at baseline were included in the 
analyses of conversion to post baseline transfusion independence for platelets and RBCs, respectively.  
Venetoclax target doses of 600mg and 800 mg were evaluated in this population. 
Exposure-Efficacy (VEN+LDAC) 
Results of the logistic regression of CR, CR+ CRi, and CR + CRh analysis are illustrated in Figure 11 for 
the exposure metric AUCss, showing that there is a statistically significant exposure-response relationship 
(P < 0.01) between venetoclax exposure and the probability of response.  The parameters of the final 
logistic regression models are presented in Table 12.  NPM1 mutations significantly associated with an 
increased probability of all responses tested (CR, CR + CRi, and CR + CRh) while TP53 mutations 
significantly associated with a decreased probability of response for CR + CRi and CR + CRh.

The CPH model to assess relationship between exposure and survival showed a trend for better survival 
outcomes in VEN + LDAC (P = 0.02 for both OS and EFS), although no significant exposure-response 
relationship was identified. Covariate analysis identified TP53 mutations as a negative predictor of both 
survival outcomes (OS and EFS) and that subjects with ECOG scores ≥ 2 had worse OS.

Table 13. Parameter Estimates of the Cox Proportional Hazards Models for Venetoclax in Combination 
with LDAC 
Rates of conversion to post baseline transfusion independence in combination therapy (VEN + LDAC) 
were compared to rates in subjects receiving PBO + LDAC in Study M16-043. Both Emax and linear 
regression models were fit to the data, but the Emax model did not converge with stable parameter 
estimates and the linear model did not adequately capture the trend of the data for rate of conversion to 
RBC transfusion independence.  An Emax logistic regression model best described the data for rate of 
conversion to platelet transfusion independence, and although there was a trend for higher probability of 
conversion in VEN + LDAC, there was no significant exposure-response relationship identified. 
Additionally, this analysis indicated that subjects with NPM1 mutations had higher probability of achieving 
conversion to platelet transfusion independence than those without NPM1 mutations. For both 
parameters, there was no significant exposure-response relationship when tested without subjects in the 
placebo group. 
Exposure-Safety (VEN+LDAC) 
No apparent relationship between venetoclax exposures and occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 
3 neutropenia was observed, although subjects taking VEN + LDAC had higher rates on average than 
subjects taking PBO + LDAC.  Both Emax and linear regression models were fit to the data, but the Emax 
model did not converge with stable parameter estimates and the linear model did not adequately capture 
the trend of the data. 
No apparent relationship between venetoclax exposures and occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 
3 infections was observed.  A logistic regression model using AUCss as exposure metric was fit to the 
data and indicated no statistically significant exposure-response relationship. 
No apparent relationship between venetoclax exposures and occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 
3 thrombocytopenia was observed.  A logistic regression model using AUCss as exposure metric was fit to 
the data and indicated no statistically significant exposure-response relationship (Table 14).

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The bioanalysis method for Venetoclax at AbbVie were not changed since the original application and 
have not been reassessed. In studies M15-656 and M16-043, bioanalysis of Venetoclax for subjects 
enrolled in China was performed at CRO WuXi (Shanghai, China) according to validation report 
17BAS0234. A cross-validation was performed which showed that the results from the two methods were 
comparable (AbbVie/WuXi Report R&D/18/0140). 
The pharmacokinetic data were analysed using population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling approach. 
The objectives were to evaluate whether a previously developed popPK model is able to describe 
venetoclax PK in AML subjects and to evaluate the relationship between venetoclax exposures and clinical 
response (efficacy and safety) in subjects with AML, with separate analyses for venetoclax in combination 
with hypomethylating agents (HMA) (VEN + HMA) and for venetoclax in combination with low-dose 
cytarabine (LDAC) (VEN + LDAC). In addition, the applicant conducted a drug-drug interaction (DDI) 
substudy in 12 subjects who were given venetoclax with and without posaconazole, to assess the 
interaction.  
The approach to use the previously developed model, with previously estimated parameters as priors is 
considered acceptable. The plot of dose normalized observed concentration indicate that the exposure is 
similar in the AML population compared to other populations (CLL, SLL and NHL).  It seems that the 
pcVPC indicates model misspecification in the absorption phase and that the model does not capture 
Cmax. A similar model misspecification was observed in the original application as well; this issue is not 
further pursued, and the model is in this applicant considered adequate for its purpose as the elimination 
phase appears to be sufficiently well captured. It is recommended that the model should not be used for 
simulation in the future without correction of the misspecification. 
The popPK model could well describe the individual concentration profiles of the 5 subjects with severe 
renal impairment with PK data available, supporting that there is no greater differences in exposure in 
subjects with severe renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal, mild and moderate renal 
impairment/function. This support the claims in 4.2 and 5.2 in the SmPC that no dose adjustment is 
needed in patients with severe (CrCl ≥15 ml/min and <90 ml/min) renal impairment.  
The covariate “Asian” was identified as significant on the parameter ‘relative bioavailability’ with this 
dataset. The applicant provided data that indicated a little to no additional risk of treatment-emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) at higher exposures of venetoclax in the dose range studied. Since the individual exposure in 
Asian subjects are within the same range as non-Asian subjects, and that there seems not to be any 
significantly increased risk of TEAEs at higher exposure, no dose adjustment in Asian subjects is needed.   
The results from the DDI study of venetoclax alone (400 mg) compared to a dose of 100 mg 
venetoclax+posaconazole results in an, on average, 2.4-fold higher AUC24. A dose of 50 mg venetoclax 
results in an, on average, 1.9-fold higher AUC24 compared with 400 mg venetoclax given alone.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021 
Page 30/132 
 
 
 
 
 
The proposed venetoclax dose reduction to 100 mg or less for all strong CYP3A inhibitors corresponds to 
a dose reduction of 75% for the 400 mg venetoclax dose in combination with azacitidine or decitabine, or 
83.3% for the 600 mg venetoclax dose in combination with LDAC. This is consistent with the approved 
dose reduction for the CLL indication, where the dose is reduced by at least 75% of the original dose. This 
is also in the line with the results from the popPK analysis, which showed that strong CYP3A inhibitors 
decreased venetoclax apparent clearance by 82.5%.  
To further support the proposed dosing regimen of venetoclax in combination with a CYP3A inhibitor, the 
applicant provided concentration data from 53 subjects from studies M14-358, M14-387, M15-656, and 
M16-043 during co-administration with posaconazole at venetoclax doses ranging from 10 to 600 mg. 
During ramp-up in which subjects received mostly up to 50 mg venetoclax in combination with the strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor, venetoclax concentrations were in the range of subjects receiving no or a mild CYP3A4 
inhibitor. During steady state, in which subjects received mostly 50-100 mg venetocloax in combination 
with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, venetoclax concentrations were in the range of subjects receiving no or 
a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor. Furthermore, patients experiencing persistent drug-related adverse events, such 
as neutropenia, infections, or thrombocytopenia can have further venetoclax dose modifications. In 
summary, the data provided support the proposed dosing regimens during ramp-up and at steady state 
during co-administration with a CYP3A inhibitor. These recommendations (dose reductions and 
monitoring) are adequately reflected in the SmPC (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
It is noted that strong CYP3A inhibitors are contraindicated (see SmPC section 4.3) during the titration 
phase in the CLL indication, but not in the proposed AML indication, which is considered acceptable as the 
indications and risk of side effects differ. In all patients, if a CYP3A inhibitor must be used, follow the 
recommendations for managing drug-drug interactions (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The exposure-response analysis was done separately for the venetoclax arm with different combination 
treatment (VEN+HMA or VEN+LDAC). The majority of subjects in the VEN+HMA treatment received 400 
mg (66%, n=379) venetoclax, while 25% (n=144) received placebo and only 8% (n=45) and 1% (n=7) 
received 800 mg and 1200 mg respectively. In the VEN+LDAC analysis 73% (n=203) received 600 mg 
venetoclax, 25% (n=68) received placebo and 3% (n=8) received venetoclax 800 mg. No subject 
received 1200 mg in that combination treatment group. The consequence and limitation of this is that 
very few subjects are informing the exposure response at higher doses than the proposed. 
Exposure-response VEN+HMA 
The logistic regression analysis results for AUCss showed that there is a statistically significant exposure-
response relationship (P < 0.01) between venetoclax exposure and the probability of response of CR + 
CRi and CR + CRh, however, the Emax model for CR did not converge with stable parameter estimates. 
The EC50 CI is wide in both models. The results need to be interpreted with caution. There is an 
indication towards a flat exposure-response relationship. The typical exposure range with a dose of 400 
mg VEN+HMA was not marked in the plots, and the distribution of subjects across the exposure range is 
unclear; the models for conversion to post baseline platelet and RBC transfusion independence did not 
converge..  
For all efficacy variables evaluated, venetoclax AUCss quartile plots showed a clear trend of higher 
efficacy with VEN + HMA than PBO + AZA. Within subjects receiving VEN + HMA, there were no apparent 
exposure-response relationships. Model-based analyses, excluding the PBO + AZA data, confirmed this 
lack of significant exposure-response relationships in the dose range studied (400 to 1200 mg). 
There is a statistically significant relationship between neutropenia in combination therapy (VEN + HMA) 
compared the PBO + HMA arm from study M15-656. Covariate analysis identified that Asian subjects in 
general were more likely to have treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia. The magnitude of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

venetoclax effect was however similar in Asian and non-Asian subjects. No apparent relationship between 
venetoclax exposure and occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 3 infections or treatment-emergent 
Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia was observed.  
Exposure-response VEN+LDAC 
Results of the logistic regression of CR, CR+ CRi, and CR + CRh analysis versus the exposure metric 
AUCss, showed that there is a statistically significant exposure-response relationship (P < 0.01) between 
venetoclax exposure and the probability of response. Few subjects given a dose other than 600 mg were 
included in the analysis, which limits the conclusions that can be made. NPM1 mutations were found to be 
significantly associated with an increased probability of all responses tested (CR, CR + CRi, and CR + 
CRh) while TP53 mutations were found to be significantly associated with a decreased probability of 
response for CR + CRi and CR + CRh. The confidence interval of both EC50 and Emax are wide. The 
typical exposure range with a dose of 600 mg VEN+LDAC was not marked in the plots, and the 
distribution of subjects across the exposure range is unclear. Rates of conversion to post baseline 
transfusion independence in combination therapy (VEN + LDAC) were best described with an Emax 
logistic regression model however, although there was a trend for higher probability of conversion in VEN 
+ LDAC, there are limitation to the analysis and no significant exposure-response relationship identified.  
No apparent relationship between venetoclax exposures and occurrence of treatment-emergent Grade ≥ 
3 neutropenia, infections or thrombocytopenia was observed; however, close monitoring of blood counts 
is recommended throughout the treatment (see also discussion of Clinical Safety and SmPC section 4.4.).  
Evaluation of BCL2 expression is still ongoing and the Applicant is encouraged to submit these data when 
available. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology data of venetoclax in the AML population was adequate and support relevant 
recommendations in the SmPC regarding special populations and drug-drug interaction with strong CYP3A 
inhibitors.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The current marketing application includes the following phase 1 to phase 3 studies for newly-diagnosed 
AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy:

With the exception of M14-212 (completed), all studies are ongoing at the time of the application. 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Studies M14-358 and M14-387 in relation with the pivotal studies M15-656 and M16-043, respectively 
provided information on dose – response.

Study M15-656 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of venetoclax in combination with 
azacitidine versus azacitidine in treatment naïve subjects with acute myeloid leukemia who are ineligible 
for standard induction therapy. 
First subject first visit: February 2017. 
Study participants 
Treatment-naïve subjects with AML ≥ 18 years of age and not eligible for standard induction therapy due 
to age or comorbidities were eligible for this study. Subjects must have received no prior treatment for 
AML, with the exception of hydroxyurea. Subjects must have ECOG of 0 to 2 (if ≥75 years of age) or 0 to 
3 if (≥ 18 to 74 years of age), adequate renal function, and adequate liver function. Patients with 
previous HMA therapy or chemotherapy for MDS were excluded, as well as those with favourable 
cytogenetic risk.

Treatments 
Subjects were randomized to one of the two treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio, both of which had treatment 
cycles of 28 days: 
•  Ven + Aza: Venetoclax 400 mg orally once a day (QD) on Days 1 – 28 plus azacitidine 75 
2 
mg/m
sc or iv (per local label) QD for 7 days 
• 
Placebo + Aza: Placebo orally QD on Days 1 – 28 plus azacitidine 75 mg/m
label) QD for 7 days 
2 
sc or iv (per local 
Venetoclax or placebo was administered with a 3-day ramp up beginning with 100 mg dose on day 1 to 
reach the final dose of 400 mg venetoclax on day 3 of cycle 1. Venetoclax was to be continued at 400 mg 
daily thereafter. Subjects were to receive azacitidine for 7days of each cycle, beginning on day 1 of each 
cycle. Bone marrow assessments were performed at screening, at the end of cycle 1, and every three 
cycles thereafter until two consecutive samples confirmed a complete remission or a complete remission 
with incomplete hematologic recovery. Patients continued to receive treatment until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxic effects, until they withdrew consent, or until they met any protocol-defined criteria. 
Except for patients who withdrew consent, all patients who discontinued a trial regimen were followed for 
survival. 
Survival information and post-treatment follow-up (i.e., the date and cause of death, all post treatment 
cancer therapies including stem cell transplantation, regimens, dates of initiation and completion, etc.) 
were to be collected every 2 months after the last study visit for a period of approximately 2 years after 
the last subject had been enrolled into the study.

Response criteria definition 
In addition, each subject was evaluated for transfusion independence based on the red blood cell (RBC) 
and platelet transfusion requirements, as well as CRh derived from the bone marrow and hematology lab 
values. A response of CRh is achieved when the following criteria are met: 
•  Bone marrow with <5% blasts 
• 
• 
Peripheral blood neutrophil count of > 0.5 × 103/µL* 
Peripheral blood platelet count of > 0.5 × 105/µL* 
* For a bone marrow sample collected before the last cycle of study treatment, the hematology lab results collected 
from the date of the bone marrow sample collection up to the Day 1 of a subsequent cycle of study treatment will be 
used for CRh analysis. 
* For a bone marrow sample collected during or after the last cycle of study treatment, the hematology lab results 
collected within 14 days after bone marrow sample collection date will be used for CRh analysis. 
* Subject must have platelet transfusion independence for ≥ 7 days prior to the hematology lab results. 
Stratification factors: age, region and cytogenetics.

Randomisation  
Study participants were randomised 2:1 in the Ven : Aza arms respectively. 
Blinding  
This was a double-blind study. 
Sample size 
The study includes dual-primary endpoints of CR + CRi rate and OS. The sample size calculation is based 
on the following assumptions: 
• 
The significance level (two-sided 0.05) is split to give a 0.01 significance level to the CR + CRi 
rate analysis and a 0.04 significance level to the OS analysis 
•  CR + CRi rate of 28% for placebo + Aza arm 
•  CR + CRi rate of 55% for Ven + Aza arm 
•  Median OS of 10.4 months for placebo + Aza arm 
•  Median OS of 14.9 months for Ven + Aza arm (HR of 0.7) 
• 
Interim analysis of OS at 75% of death events with O'Brien-Fleming (OBF) boundary; the interim 
data cutoff date for this analysis is determined when the 270th subject death is observed 
•  2:1 randomization ratio to Ven + Aza and placebo + Aza arms 
With the above assumptions, a total of 225 subjects (150 subjects in the Ven + Aza arm and 75 subjects 
in the placebo + Aza arm) provides 88% power to detect statistically significant differences in the CR + 
CRi rate between treatment arms at two-sided alpha levels of 0.01; a total of 360 death events will 
provide 86.7% power to detect statistically significant difference in OS between treatment arms at two-
sided alpha level of 0.04.  
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis for CR + CRi was to occur 6 months after the first 225 subjects were randomized. A 
significance level of 0.01 out of 0.05 (two-sided) was to be allocated for this analysis.  
There were 3 planned analyses for the primary endpoint of OS. 
1.  IA1: at the same time as the primary CR + CRi analysis. An administrative spending of 0.0001 (one-
sided) significance level were allocated to this analysis) 
2.  IA2: at the time of approximately 270 OS events (75% of the total 360 events). (March 2020). 
3.  Final analysis at the time of approximately 360 OS events. 
Analysis sets 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the Efficacy Analysis Set (also called Full Analysis Set), defined as all 
randomized subjects in Group 2. This group consisted of subjects randomized under Protocol Amendment 
1 and later versions. The safety analyses were performed on the Safety Analysis Set, defined as all 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (venetoclax or placebo, in combination with 
azacitidine). 
Statistical method 
All efficacy analyses were analyzed by treatment arm and strata assigned at time of randomization, based 
on IVRS/IWRS, age (18 to < 75, ≥ 75) and cytogenetic risk (intermediate, poor). For the primary OS

endpoint, the stratified log-rank test was used for the comparison of OS distributions between two arms. 
In addition, the stratified hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were 
estimated from stratified Cox proportional hazard model. The CR + Cri rate and secondary endpoints 
were compared between two arms using stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test.  
Intercurrent events - OS censoring  
If a subject has not died, then the data was censored at the date the subject was last known to be alive 
on or before the cutoff date. The date of the last known alive was determined by selecting the last 
available date of the following study procedures for a subject: adverse event start date, bone marrow 
collection, disease assessment, vital signs assessment, clinical laboratory collection, study drug 
administration, concomitant medicine start date, biospecimen sample collection, transfusion, survival 
follow-up, quality of life assessments, and performance status. 
Alternative censoring rules applied as a sensitivity analysis were censoring OS and DoR at the start of 
post-study treatment (e.g., intensive chemotherapy) if occurred prior to an event. 
Multiplicity 
The alpha split, recycling, Lan DeMets alpha spending function and hierarchical testing strategies were 
used to control the familywise error rate (FWER) at interim and final analyses. For primary efficacy 
endpoints, a significance level of 0.01 (two-sided) was allocated for the analysis of CR + CRi rate and a 
significance level of 0.04 (two-sided) was allocated for the analysis of overall survival to ensure the 
control of the FWER. If statistical test is significant for CR + CRi rate, the significance level 0.01 allocated 
to CR + CRi rate analysis is recycled to overall survival analysis. 
If statistical test is significant for the primary efficacy endpoint of OS, then the fixed sequence testing 
procedure was performed with a significance level of 0.05 for key secondary efficacy endpoints 
sequentially. If statistical test is not significant for the primary efficacy endpoint of OS, then statistical 
significance cannot be declared for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints. The hierarchical ranking and 
alpha spending for each primary and key secondary endpoint at IA1, IA2 and FA is presented below.

Results 
Participant flow 
Conduct of the study 
IA1 data cutoff date: 01 October 2018; IA2 data cutoff date: 04 January 2020 
The IDMC recommended that the study be unblinded on 16 March 2020, based on the data at IA2 and 
guided by the prespecified OBF boundary. 
Amendments to the original protocol   
•  Amendment 1 (December 2016; 2 subjects globally) NOTE: these two patients are denominated 
Group 1 by Abbvie; all consecutive patients are Group 2, with cytogenetics added to age and 
region as a stratification factor): to lower the age limit for study eligibility and enrol AML subjects 
≥ 18 years of age who are ineligible for standard induction therapies due to comorbidities instead 
of ≥ 60 years of age.  
•  Amendment 2 (February 2017; 47 subjects globally): to clarify the definitions for PD and EFS. To 
support venetoclax dose reductions during the ramp-up when co-administered with strong 
cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors exposure-response analysis from a Phase 1b study of 
venetoclax with HMAs (Study M14-358) was included. Subject stratification groups were updated 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021 
Page 39/132 
 
 
 
 
 
to include cytogenetic risk to evaluate the differences in biology of disease in younger AML 
patients. 
•  Amendment 3 (May 2017; 295 subjects globally): in response to a request during Voluntary 
Harmonisation Procedure to clarify that sponsor approval is not necessary for the investigator 
prior to unblinding a subject and to provide additional clarification of subjects with or without a 
BCR-ABL mutation within the eligibility criteria of the study.  
•  Amendment 4 (March 2018; 48 subjects globally): to add and define CRh analysis to be done on 
study data, as well as to clarify that home administration of azacitidine was not allowed and 
administration of azacitidine per the local label which was utilized at the sites.  
•  Amendment 5 (August 2018; 30 subjects globally): to ensure alignment between the protocol and 
SAP of CR + CRi rate analysis for the study, as well as clarify that OS and CR + CRi dual primary 
endpoints will be utilized for Japan, the EU, and EU reference countries while OS will be the single 
primary endpoint of analysis for the US and US reference countries. The primary efficacy endpoint 
of CR + CRi rate is to be based on investigator assessment. Additionally, the secondary endpoints 
of this study were updated to include evaluation of MRD (including MRD thresholds of < 10–3), 
CRh, transfusion independence, and molecular markers. 
•  Amendment 6 (May 2019; 0 subjects globally): to update the total number of OS events (as 
enrolment in the study was projected to continue at the anticipated time of the  survival event 
accrual for the interim survival analysis), to increase the follow up of the subjects.  
•  Amendment 7 (August 2019; 0 subjects globally): to revise the definition of CR as a neutrophil 
count > 1000/μL and platelet count of > 100,000/μL per IWG criteria and to clarify the version of 
the NCCN guidelines for AML used to assess cytogenetic risk stratification criterion. 
Amendments to SAP 
Several amendments to the SAP were performed to reflect the updates to the study protocol. SAP version 
4 change the rationale for sample size and increased the power of the study. 
•  SAP version 4, dated 30 May 2019: described the full efficacy and safety statistical analyses for 
Protocol Amendment 6, dated 15 May 2019. The total number of OS events was increased from 
302 to 360 with the number of events for 75% OS IA increased from 227 to 270 to ensure 
adequate study power for OS endpoint (from 80% to 86.7%). This proposed change in OS events 
was discussed with the FDA via teleconference meeting on 10 May 2019 with their agreement. In 
addition, confirmed and un-confirmed PD were added. Unconfirmed PD was defined as a PD 
followed by non-PD/Non-MR prior to post-treatment therapy. 
Protocol deviations 
•  Subject entered study and did not satisfy eligibility criteria: 8 in 8 subjects. 
•  Subject received wrong treatment or incorrect dose: 127 in 99 subjects. 
•  Subject received excluded concomitant medications: 9 in 9 subjects. 
• 
• 
• 
Protocol Compliance – Study Procedures: 79 in 79 subjects. 
Protocol Compliance – Subject Dosing Compliance: 14 in 10 subjects 
Investigational Product (IP) – Dispensation/Administration: 9 in 8 subjects. 
Baseline data 
Demographics: predominantly male (259 subjects [60.1%]) and White (326 subjects [75.6%]). The 
median age was 76 years (range: 49 to 91 years). The majority of subjects (60.6%) were ≥ 75 years of 
age.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 400 subjects (267 subjects in the Ven + Aza arm and 133 subjects in the placebo + Aza arm) 
were randomized into the study. 
Extent of exposure 
The median duration of exposure in the Ven + Aza arm was 7.6 months (range: 0.1-30.7) and in the Pbo 
+ Aza arm was 4.3 months (range: 0.1-24). Subjects received venetoclax for a median of 7 cycles 
(range: 1-30) versus 4.5 cycles (range: 1-26) in the comparator arm. 
In the Ven + Aza arm, 267 subjects (94.3%) had at least 1 dose interruption for any reason (including 
interruption during cycles, between 28-day cycles, and duration reduction): 17.7% had 1 interruption, 
11.7% had 2 interruptions, and 65% had > 2 interruptions. In the comparator arm, 112 subjects 
(77.8%) had at least 1 dose interruption for any reason: 23.6% had 1 interruption, 20% had 2 
interruptions, and 34% had > 2 interruptions.  
The median duration of study follow-up was 20.5 months: 20.7 months (95% CI: 20.1, 22 months) for 
subjects in the Ven + Aza arm and 20.2 months (95% CI: 19.6, 22.4 months) for the comparator.

Outcomes and estimation 
Unless otherwise specified, the primary analysis of all response-related endpoints is based on the 
investigator assessment. The analyses for the secondary endpoints are presented for the 431 subjects in 
Group 2. Due to the small number of subjects in Group 1 (n=2), no formal statistical analyses were 
performed for these subjects. 
IDMC performed 2 planned interim efficacy analyses, one for the primary CR+ CRi rate analysis with a 
data cutoff date of 01 October 2018 and a second interim analysis for the OS endpoint, with a data cutoff 
date of 04 January 2020, when 270 (75% of 360) OS events were observed.

Secondary endpoints:  
CR+CRi rate by initiation of cycle 2 
There were 124 subjects (43.4%) in the Ven + Aza arm versus 11 subjects (7.6%) in the Pbo + Aza arm 
who achieved CR + CRi by the initiation of Cycle 2. Among subjects in the Ven + Aza arm who achieved a 
best response of CR + CRi, median time to first response was 1.3 months (range: 0.6 to 9.9 months) 
compared to 2.8 months (range: 0.8 to 13.2 months) in the comparator arm. The median time to best 
response of CR + CRi was 2.3 months in the Ven + Aza arm and 3.7 months in the Pbo + Aza arm.

CR+CRh 
DOR 
•  Duration of CR 
The median duration of response for CR was 17.5 months (95% CI: 15.3, - months) in the Ven + Aza 
arm (N = 105) and 13.3 months (95% CI: 8.5, 17.6 months) in the comparator arm (N = 26). The 
number of subjects with events of MR, PD or death due to disease progression were 39/105 subjects 
(37.1%) in the Ven + Aza arm vs 13/26 subjects (50%). 
•  Duration of CR+CRi 
The median duration of response for CR + CRi was 17.5 months (95% CI: 13.6, - months) in the Ven + 
Aza arm (N = 190) and 13.4 months (95% CI: 5.8, 15.5 months) in the comparator arm (N = 41). The 
number of subjects with events of MR, PD or death due to disease progression were 84/190 subjects 
(44.2%) in the Ven + Aza arm vs 23/41 subjects (56.1%). 
•  Duration of CR+CRh 
The median duration of response for CR + CRh was 17.8 months (95% CI: 15.3, - months) in the Ven + 
Aza arm (N = 185) and 13.9 months (95% CI: 10.4, 15.7 months) in the comparator arm (N = 33). The 
number of subjects with events of MR, PD or death due to disease progression were 79/185 subjects 
(42.7%) in the Ven + Aza arm vs 17/33 subjects (51.5%). 
Transfusion independence rate  
Transfusion dependence at baseline was defined as having received RBCs and/or having received 
platelets within 8 weeks prior to study treatment (or prior to randomization if not dosed). Transfusion 
independence, defined as a 56-day or greater RBC and platelet transfusion-free period while on study 
therapy (subjects who did not receive study drug were considered transfusion dependent during the 
study), was evaluated for both groups. 
RBC 
In the Ven + Aza arm, 171 subjects (59.8%) achieved RBC transfusion independence compared to 51 
subjects (35.2%) in the Pbo + Aza arm. The median duration of RBC transfusion independence after 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021

receiving first dose of study treatment was 199 days for Ven + Aza (range: 57 to 933 days), and 193 
days for Pbo + Aza (range: 56 to 727 days). The median time to first postbaseline RBC transfusion 
independence was 29 days for Ven + Aza arm and 51 days for Pbo + Aza arm. 
Platelets 
In the Ven + Aza arm, 196 subjects (68.5%) achieved platelet transfusion independence compared to 72 
subjects (49.7%) in the Pbo + Aza arm. The median duration of platelet transfusion independence after 
receiving first dose of study treatment was 210 days for Ven + Aza (range: 56 to 933 days), and 227.5 
days for Pbo + Aza (range: 58, 730 days). The median time to first postbaseline platelet transfusion 
independence was 7 days for Ven + Aza arm and 1 day for Pbo + Aza arm. 
MRD 
MRD at 10-3 level was assessed by centralized multicolour flow cytometry. Note: this was not a formal 
test of the secondary endpoint for the US marketing application (MRD negativity rate). 
At the time of the data cutoff date (04 January 2020), 216/286 subjects in the Ven + Aza arm and 
104/145 subjects in the Pbo + Aza arm had an MRD assessment. The median MRD value for all subjects 
was lower in the Ven + Aza arm compared with the Pbo + Aza arm (0.18 and 1.60, respectively). Among 
subjects in the Ven + Aza arm, 67/286 subjects (23.4%) achieved CR + CRi responses and MRD < 10–3 
vs 11/145 subjects (7.6%) in the comparator arm. OS: for the CR + CRi and MRD < 10–3, the median 
time was not reached in the Ven + Aza arm (N = 67) and was 24.8 months in the Pbo + Aza arm (N = 
11). 
EFS  
EFS was defined as the number of days from randomization to the date of PD, confirmed MR from CR or 
CRi, treatment failure defined as failure to achieve CR, CRi, or MLFS after at least 6 cycles of study 
treatment collected on study drug completion eCRF, or death from any cause. A total of 313/360 EFS 
events were observed in IA2 and information fraction in IA2 is 87%. The two-sided alpha for EFS analysis 
at IA2 is 0.032.

Baseline data 
Of the 212 patients treated with any dose of venetoclax in combination with either of the HMAs, 195 
(92%) had discontinued venetoclax treatment by the safety data cutoff date of 30 August 2019. The most 
common primary reasons for discontinuation (≥ 10% of subjects) of any dose of venetoclax with 
azacitidine were disease progression in 40 subjects (31.5%); AEs not related to progression (24, 18.9%); 
and other, 36 (28.3%). The most common primary reasons for discontinuation (≥ 10%) of any dose of 
venetoclax with decitabine were: disease progression in 30 subjects (41.1%); AEs not related to 
progression in 10 subjects (13.7%); and other in 20 subjects (27.4%).  
The median duration of venetoclax exposure among subjects receiving 400 mg venetoclax in combination 
with azacitidine (n=84) was 6.4 months (range, 0.1 to 38.1 months). Approximately half of subjects in 
this group (45 subjects, 53.6%) received venetoclax for > 5 cycles, with a median of 6 cycles.  
For subjects receiving 400 mg venetoclax in combination with decitabine (n=31), the median duration of 
venetoclax exposure was 5.7 months (range, 0.5 to 41.8 months). Approximately half of subjects in this 
group (16 subjects, 51.6%) received venetoclax for > 5 cycles, with a median of 6 cycles.

Study M16-043 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of venetoclax co-administered with low 
dose cytarabine versus low dose cytarabine in treatment-naïve patients with acute myeloid leukemia who 
are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.  
First Subject First Visit:  24 May 2017 
Last Subject Last Visit:  not yet occurred, data cut-off for the primary analysis was 15 February 2019, 
and 15 August 2019 for the post-hoc the 6-month follow-up analysis.

Treatments 
Cycles of 28 days: 
•  Arm A (VEN + LDAC arm):  Venetoclax 600 mg orally once daily on days 1 - 28 plus LDAC 20 
mg/m2 sc days 1 – 10 
•  Arm B (PBO + LDAC arm):  Placebo 600 mg orally days 1 – 28 plus LDAC 20mg/m2 sc d 1 – 10 
Patients are treated until DP or unacceptable toxicity. FU every 2 months for 2 years after last subject is 
enrolled in the trial. 
Response assessments were performed after cycle 1 (patients with resistant disease after cycle 1 had 
repeat assessments after cycle 2 or 3 to assess initial CR/CRi response) and every 3 cycles thereafter 
(starting at the end of cycle 4 and continuing until disease progression) until 2 consecutive samples 
confirmed stable achievement of CR or CRi. Assessments were also performed if there was suspected 
relapse and/or at the final study visit. Clinical responses were defined according to modified International 
Working Group response criteria for AML. Progressive disease was defined per European LeukemiaNet 
recommendations. Treatment failure was defined as failure to achieve morphologic leukemia-free state or 
higher response (CR, CRi, partial remission) after at least 6 cycles of treatment. EFS was defined as the 
number of days from randomization to disease progression, confirmed relapse, treatment failure, or 
death.

Exploratory endpoints:

Sample size 
The primary endpoint of the study is overall survival and sample size calculation is based on the following 
assumptions: 
•  Median OS of 6 months for placebo plus LDAC arm 
•  Median OS of 11 months for venetoclax plus LDAC arm (hazard ratio of 0.545) 
• 
Interim analysis of OS at 75% of death events with O'Brien-Fleming boundary 
•  2:1 randomization ratio to venetoclax plus LDAC, and placebo plus LDAC arm 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021 
Page 61/132 
 
 
 
 
With the above assumptions, a total of 133 death events will provide 90% power to detect statistically 
significant different between treatment arms at alpha level of 0.05. A total of approximately 210 subjects 
(140 in venetoclax plus LDAC arm and 70 in placebo plus LDAC arm) will be randomized into the study to 
obtain the 133 death events. 
Randomisation: 2:1, 142:68 (actual number), stratified by AML status (secondary, de novo), age (18 – < 
75, ≥ 75) and region (US, EU, China, Japan, Rest of world). 
Blinding: double blind 
Statistical methods 
The full analysis set consisting of all randomized subjects will be used for efficacy analyses. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival (OS). Overall survival will be defined as the number of 
days from the date of randomization to the date of death. Subjects that have not died will be censored at 
the last known date to be alive. The distribution of overall survival will be estimated for each treatment 
arm using Kaplan-Meier methodology and compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test 
stratified by AML status (secondary, de novo) and age (18 – < 75, ≥ 75). 
Fixed sequence testing procedure will be used for analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints. If 
statistical test is not significant for the primary efficacy endpoint of OS, then statistical significance will 
not be declared for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Secondary endpoints that are rates will be compared between treatment arms using CMH test stratified 
by AML status (secondary, de novo) and age (18 - < 75, ≥ 75). In addition, 95% confidence interval will 
be constructed for CR + CRh. A linear mixed effects regression model with a variable covariance structure 
will be fitted to the longitudinal data to test for differences between treatment arms. 
An interim analysis will be performed at the time of the 100th death event. The Lan-DeMets alpha 
spending function with O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be used to ensure that the one-sided false positive 
rate will be 0.025 or less for overall survival. The planned efficacy stopping boundary were p<0.01 (1-
sided). Final analysis will be performed at the time of the 133rd death event. 
In addition to the final SAP, the following statistical analyses were performed (a selection). 
•  Cox proportional hazard regression models with stepwise variable selection were performed on 
OS in the whole population and in the Japan region, respectively, as sensitivity analyses to 
identify relevant prognostic factors for OS and to better understand the treatment effect on OS 
when adjusting for these factors. 
•  Overall survival was summarized for subjects who achieved CR, CR + CRi, or CR + CRh and for 
subjects who did not achieve CR + CRi or CR + CRh per investigator assessment to characterize 
the association between achieving a response and survival benefit. 
•  An additional threshold of less than 10–4 was applied in the analyses of MRD responses to 
evaluate the sensitivity of the threshold on MRD response and the relationship between MRD 
response and OS. 
• 
In the analyses of EFS, treatment failure was defined as failure to achieve CR, CRi, PR, or MLFS 
collected on the study drug completion eCRF as assessed by the investigator instead of failure to 
achieve CR, CRi, or MLFS, after at least 6 cycles of study treatment. This change was made to be 
consistent with the definition of treatment failure in the study protocol. 
•  An unplanned 6-month follow-up analysis was performed on all efficacy and safety endpoints.

Results 
Participant flow 
Primary analysis 
As of the data cut-off date for the 6-month follow-up (August 2019), 211 subjects had been randomized: 
143  in the VEN + LDAC arm (venetoclax 600 mg + LDAC) and 68 in the PBO + LDAC arm (placebo + 
LDAC);  103 and 56 patients, respectively, had completed the study.  
A total of 180 (85.3%) patients overall discontinued treatment; 117 patients (81.8%) in the VEN + LDAC 
arm and 63 (92.6%) in the PBO + LDAC arm. Primary reasons for venetoclax discontinuation for ≥ 10% 
of subjects (VEN + LDAC arm) included morphologic relapse (16.1%), treatment failure and death 
(12.6% each), progressive disease (11.9%), and AE not related to disease progression (10.5%).  The 
primary reasons for placebo discontinuation for ≥ 10% of subjects (PBO arm) included treatment failure 
(19.1%), progressive disease (17.6%), physician decision, death, and withdrew decision (11.8%, each).

Primary reasons for LDAC discontinuation for ≥ 10% of subjects overall included treatment failure 
(14.7%), progressive disease (13.7%), death (12.3%), morphologic relapse (12.3%), and AE not related 
to disease progression (10%). 
Median time on study was 17.5months for the VEN + LDAC arm and 17.7months for the PBO + LDAC 
arm. Overall, 159 subjects (75.4%) discontinued the study: 103 (72.0%) in the VEN + LDAC arm and 56 
(82.4%) in the PBO + LDAC arm. Primary reasons for study discontinuation from the VEN + LDAC arm 
included death (67.8%), withdrawn consent (2.8%), and lost to follow up; for the comparator, death 
(77.9%), and withdrawn consent (4.4%). 
Conduct of the study 
Amendments to protocol 
•  Amendment 1 (February 2017, 117 subjects): AML subjects ≥ 18 years of age. 
•  Amendment 2 (October 2017, 59 subjects): to clarify that patients previously treated with 
venetoclax or other concurrent investigational agents could not be enrolled.  
•  Amendment 3 (June 2018, 21 subjects): to add evaluation of CR + CRh as a secondary endpoint 
and of transfusion independence during any consecutive 56 days during the study treatment 
period as an exploratory endpoint. 
•  Amendment 4 (November 2018, 0 subjects): to clarify that the endpoints of transfusion 
independence rates, MRD response rate, CR + CRh by the initiation of Cycle 2 and OS in 
molecular subgroups were secondary objectives.   
•  Amendment 5 (May 2019, 0 subjects): to allow the sponsor to unblind subject treatment 
assignments following the final analysis results and provide the investigators with this information 
if requested by them or by the subjects, so that a decision could be made in regard to the 
subjects' treatment continuation. 
Amendments to SAP 
In addition to the final SAP, a number of unplanned analyses were performed to further explore the 
results, see Statistical methods. 
Protocol deviations did not impact study results. 
Baseline data 
At the 6- month follow-up, subjects were predominantly male, 117 subjects (55.5%) and white, 149 
subjects (70.6%).  Median age was 76 years (range:  36-93). he VEN + LDAC arm had a higher 
proportion of subjects ≥ 65 compared to the PBO + LDAC arm (92.3% vs 86.8%, respectively). This 
however is not indicative of an imbalance between arms.

Extent of exposure 
At the time of the time of the 6-month follow-up (15 August 2019), the median duration of venetoclax 
exposure was 4.1 months (range: 0-23.5). Median duration of placebo exposure was 1.7 months (range:  
0.1-20.2).  There were 29 patients (20.4%) with 1 venetoclax dose reduction. A total of 46 patients 
(32.4%) had 1 venetoclax dose interruption due to any reason, of which 23 (16.2%) due to count 
recovery. Overall, the median duration of LDAC exposure was 2.2 months (range: 0-23.4); 3.5 months in 
the VEN + LDAC arm and 1.3 months in the comparator arm.

Study M14-387 
Phase 1/2 Study of venetoclax in combination with low-dose cytarabine in treatment-naïve subjects with 
acute myelogenous leukemia who are ≥ 60 years of age and who are not eligible for standard 
anthracycline-based induction therapy. 
First Subject First Visit: 31 December 2014 
Last Subject Last Visit: has not yet occurred;  
Data cutoff for interim CSR: 19 July 2019 
Methods 
The study consisted of 3 portions. The first was a Phase 1 (dose-escalation portion), that evaluated the 
safety and PK profile of venetoclax administered with LDAC with the objectives of defining the MTD and 
generating data to support a RPTD. A subsequent initial Phase 2 portion evaluated whether the RPTD had 
sufficient efficacy and acceptable toxicity to warrant further development of the combination therapy. 
Subsequently, a Phase 2, Cohort C was enrolled to evaluate the ORR for subjects who were allowed 
additional supportive medications (e.g., strong CYP3A inhibitors), if medically indicated. 
Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria: ≥ 60 years of age; AML ineligible for standard induction; no prior treatment for 
AML with the exception of hydroxyurea, allowed through the first cycle of study treatment, and treatment 
for prior MDS; ECOG: 0-2 for patients ≥ 75 years of age and 0-3 ≥ 60 to 74 years. 
Treatments 
In portion 1, 18 patients received daily po doses of venetoclax ranging from 200 to 2000 mg, in 
combination with cytarabine 20 mg/m2 d1-10 for 2 cycles (a cycle has 28 days). In portion 2, 53 patients 
received venetoclax at the suggested target dose of 600 mg. In portion 3, 21 patients received the same 
treatment, with additional supportive medication as needed. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary: ORR (CR+CRi+PR) 
Secondary: leukemia response (rates of complete remission [CR], complete remission with incomplete 
blood count recovery [CRi], partial remission [PR], and morphologically leukemia-free status [MLFS]), 
duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS) 
Outcomes and estimation 
In subjects treated with venetoclax (600 mg) in combination with LDAC (n=82), the median duration of 
survival follow-up was 41.7 months and ORR was 54.9% (45/82). The CR+CRi rate was 53.7% with a CR 
rate of 25.6% and a CRi rate of 28%.  
The median duration of CR + CRi was 9.8 months, DoCR 14.8 months, and DoCRi 4.7 months.  
The CR+CRh rate was 46.3% with a mDoR of 11 months; the CRh was 20.7%, with a median duration of 
6.6 months. The median OS was 9.7 months, in comparison to LDAC monotherapy, with a mOS of 5 to 6 
months. Among patients who achieved CR+CRh, the mOS was 19.8 months; for those who did not, the 
mOS was 3.7 months. In CR+CRi patients the mOS was 18.4 months  
60/82 subjects (73.2%) were dependent on RBC or platelet transfusion at baseline and 27/60 previously 
dependent subjects (45%) became transfusion independent while receiving study drugs.  Of the 22 
subjects who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusion at baseline, 10/22 subjects (45.5%) 
achieved a 56-day or greater RBC and platelet transfusion-free period while actively receiving study 
drugs.

•  Cytogenetic risk group: CR+ CRh rate of 57.1%, CR + CRi rate of 63.3%, and a CR rate of 34.7% 
were observed in the intermediate risk group (n=49) and a CR + CRh rate of 34.6%, CR + CRi 
rate of 42.3%, and a CR rate of 15.4% in the poor risk group (n=26), with a mDOR of CR + CRh 
of  11.9 months and 5.6 months, respectively, and 10.8 months and 4.7 months for CR+CRi. 
mOS: 14.2 months and 4.8 months, respectively. Patients achieved transfusion independence 
regardless of cytogenetic risk group. 
•  Age: for AML ≥ 75 years old (n= 40) the results were: CR + CRh rate of 55%, CR + CRi rate of 
60% and a CR rate of 27.5% compared to 42 patients <75 years old (n = 42, who had a CR + 
CRh rate of 38.1%, a CR+ CRi rate of 47.6%, and a CR rate of 23.8%, the mDOR of CR + CRh 
was 15 months, of CR+ CRi was 14.8 months, and of CR was 25.9 months for subjects ≥ 75 
years old, compared to 10 months, 6.1 months, and 11.6 months, respectively, for subjects < 75 
years old. The mOS for ≥ 75 was 14.9 months compared 6.5 months in patients < 75 years old.  
Among the 40 subjects ≥ 75 years of age, 24/40 subjects (60%) achieved RBC transfusion 
independence and 25/40 subjects (62.5%) achieved platelet transfusion independence compared 
to 35.7% and 54.8%, respectively, for subjects < 75 years of age.

• 
Primary/secondary AML:  Secondary AML, AML arising from an antecedent hematologic disorder, 
or AML after exposure to chemotherapy or radiation is a well-recognized poor prognostic feature 
for patients with newly diagnosed AML. Among the 40 patients who received venetoclax (600 mg) 
in combination with LDAC with secondary AML, 32.5% achieved a CR + CRh and 35.0% achieved 
a CR + CRi (CR rate: 5%); a CR + CRh rate of 59.5% and a CR+ CRi rate of 71.4% (CR rate:  
45.2%) were achieved in subjects who had primary AML (n=42). The mDoR of CR + CRh was 8.3 
months, of CR+ CRi 8.1 months, and of CR was 9.6 months, compared to 31.2, 10.8, and 25.9 
months, respectively, for subjects who had primary AML. The mOS was 4 months vs 15.7 
months, respectively. In secondary AML, 15/40 patients (37.5%) achieved RBC transfusion 
independence and 20/40subjects (50%) achieved platelet transfusion independence compared to 
57.1% and 66.7%, respectively, for subjects who had primary AML. 
Prior HMA treatment for antecedent hematological disorders (poor prognosis; these patients are 
excluded from most treatment-naïve AML studies of low intensity therapy), n=24: 33.3% 
achieved a CR + CRh and a CR + CRi each (CR rate:  4.2%) while a CR + CRh rate of 51.7% and 
a CR + CRi rate of 62.1% (CR rate:  34.5%) were observed in subjects not previously treated 
with an HMA (n = 58). The mDOR of CR + CRh was 5.5 months,of CR+ CRi 5.3months, and of CR  
7.2 months, 16.9, 11.6, and 25.9 months, respectively, for subjects who did not receive a prior 
HMA for antecedent hematological disorders. The mOS was 4.1 months vs 11.7 months.  Among 
the 24 subjects who received a prior HMA for antecedent hematological disorders treated with 
venetoclax 600mg in combination with LDAC, 9/24 subjects (37.5%) achieved RBC transfusion 
independence and 12/24 subjects (50.0%) achieved platelet transfusion independence compared 
to 51.7% and 62.1%, respectively, for subjects not treated with a prior HMA. 
•  AML with MDS-related change, n=40: 47.5% achieved a CR + CRh and 52.5% achieved a CR + 
CRi (CR rate:  20%); a CR + CRh rate of 45.2% and a CR+ CRi rate of 54.8% (CR rate:  31%) 
were achieved in subjects who had AML with no MDS-related changes (n=42). The mDOR of CR + 
CRh was 10 months, CR+ CRi 9.8 months, and of CR 12.1 months for subjects who had AML with 
MDS-related changes, compared to 15, 10.8, and 25.9 months, respectively, for subjects who had 
AML with no MDS-related changes. The mOS was 10.1months vs 9.0 months in AML with no 
MDS-related changes.  18/40 subjects (45%) achieved RBC transfusion independence and 62.5% 
platelet transfusion independence compared to 50% and 54.8%, respectively, for subjects who 
had AML with no-MDS-related changes.  
•  Biomarkers: Response rates (CR/CRh/CRi) and mOS for subjects with IDH 1/2 or NPM1 mutations 
were greater than response rates and longer than the median OS for the overall population 
(subjects treated with venetoclax [600 mg] in combination with LDAC) which is consistent with 
the better prognosis for subjects with these mutations compared to subjects without IDH 1/2 or 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

NPM1 mutations. The patients with FLT-3 and TP53 mutations had lower response rates and 
shorter median OS compared to overall population; however, the response rates are clinically 
meaningful for this difficult-to-treat subject population who typically have poor prognosis 
compared to subjects without FLT-3 or TP53 mutations. IDH 1/2 (n = 18): 12 subjects (66.7%) 
achieved CR + CRh and 13 subjects (72.2%) achieved CR+ CRi with a CR rate of 38.9%, the 
mOS was 15.9 months. FLT-3 (n=15): 5 patients (33.3%) achieved CR + CRh and 6 (40%) CR + 
CRi with a CR rate of 20%, with a mOS of 6.5 months. TP53 (n = 10):  2 patients achieved CR + 
CRh and 3 achieved CR + CRi with a CR rate of 0; mOS was 3.7 months. NPM1 (n = 9): 8 
patients (88.9%) achieved CR + CRh and 8 subjects (88.9%) achieved CR + CRi with a CR rate of 
77.8%; the mOS was not reached [95% CI:  0.5, -]; the 12-month survival rate was 88.9%. 
•  MRD: among the 38 patients treated with venetoclax (600 mg) in combination with LDAC who 
achieved a CR + CRh, 34.2% a best MRD value of< 0.1% with a median OS of 29.6 months 
(survival rate at 12 months:  92.3%) and 25 subjects had a best MRD value of ≥ 0.1% with a 
median OS of 18.4 months (survival rate at 12 months:  75.1%). CRh is a clinically meaningful 
response as demonstrated by DOR, OS, transfusion independence rates, duration of transfusion 
independence, effect on AML-related comorbidities such as rates of infections, and time to 
hospitalization as compared to non-responders.  
• 
For subjects who experienced an AE that resulted in a dose reduction or dose interruption, the 
CR, CR + CRh, and CR + CRi rates remained similar to or greater than the rates of subjects that 
had no dose reduction or interruption. A CR rate of 31.3%, a CR + CRh rate of 58.3%, and a CR 
+ CRi rate of 68.8% were achieved in the dose-interrupted/-reduced subject population (n=48); 
whereas, a CR rate of 17.6%, a CR + CRh rate of 29.4%, and a CR + CRi rate of 32.4% were 
achieved in the subject population with no dose interruption or reduction(n=34). The mDORs 
were greater than or similar for subjects who had a dose interruption or reduction compared to 
subjects with no dose interruption or reduction.  For subjects who had a dose interruption or 
reduction, the median duration of CR was 30.9 months, of CR + CRh 14.3months, and of CR + 
CRi was 9.8 months, compared to 11.8, 10.2, and 10.2 months, respectively, for subjects who did 
not have a dose interruption or reduction.

Endpoints and 
definitions 
CR rate 
Complete 
remission rate 
The proportion of subjects who achieve CR at any time point 
during the study. 
Per protocol: CR is defined as absolute neutrophil count 
≥ 103/µL, platelets ≥ 105/µL, red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusion independence, and bone marrow with < 5% 
blasts. 
Modified: CR is defined as ANC > 103/µL, platelets 
> 105/µL, RBC transfusion independence, and bone marrow 
with < 5% blasts; absence of circulating blasts and blasts 
with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease.  
CR responses not meeting modified criteria were 
downgraded to CRi or CRh. Differences between values 
defined by per protocol criteria and values defined by 
modified criteria were in CR rate and CR duration only.  
CRi rate 
CRh rate 
CR + CRi rate 
CR + CRh rate 
-- 
OS 
-- 
Complete 
remission with 
incomplete blood 
count recovery 
rate 
The proportion of subjects who achieve CRi at any time 
point during the study. 
CRi is defined as bone marrow with < 5% blasts, absolute 
neutrophils < 103/µL or platelets < 105/µL 
(thrombocytopenia). 
Complete 
remission with 
partial 
hematologic 
recovery rate 
The proportion of subjects who achieve CRh at any time 
point during the study.  
CRh is defined as bone marrow with < 5% blasts, absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) > 0.5 × 103/µL (1 week [≥ 7 days] 
platelet transfusion-free period prior to the hematology 
laboratory sample collection) without recovery of platelets 
> 0.5 × 105/µL and ANC > 103/µL, which would define CR. 
Duration of 
response 
The number of months from the date of first response to 
relapse or death due to disease progression. 
Overall survival 
The number of days from the date of first dose to the date of 
death. 
Postbaseline 
transfusion 
independence rate 
The number of subjects known to achieve postbaseline 
transfusion independence.  
Postbaseline transfusion independence is defined as a period 
of at least 56 days with no RBC or platelet transfusion 
between the first dose of study drug and the last dose of 
study drug + 30 days, disease progression (including clinical 
progression), or death, or data versioning date, whichever 
occurs earlier.

Design 
Phase 1/2, nonrandomized, multicenter study consisting of 3 distinct portions: a 
Phase 1 dose-escalation portion to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
and generate data to support a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D); an initial 
Phase 2 portion to evaluate whether the RP2D had sufficient efficacy and 
acceptable toxicity to warrant further development of the combination therapy; 
and a Phase 2, Cohort C portion to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) for 
subjects allowed additional supportive medications (strong cytochrome P450 
[CYP]3A inhibitors) if medically indicated

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The current extension of indication application includes two randomized, double-blind phase 3 studies for 
newly-diagnosed AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, supported by two phase 1 trials, all 
ongoing: 
•  Study M15-656 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of venetoclax in 
combination with azacitidine versus placebo in combination with azacitidine. Study M14-358 is a 
non-randomized Phase 1b study of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or decitabine. 
•  Study M16-043 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of venetoclax in 
combination with low-dose cyatarabine (LDAC) versus placebo in combination with LDAC. Study 
M14-387 is a non-randomized phase 1/2 study of venetoclax in combination with LDAC 
Study M15-656 – venetoclax + AZA vs placebo + AZA 
This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted as 
confirmatory for phase 1b study M14-358. The clinical data cut-off date was January 2020. The study 
enrolled patients from February 2017 to May 2019. 
Eligible patients were ≥18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of previously untreated AML and ineligible for 
standard induction therapy if: ≥75 years of age or had at least one of the following coexisting conditions 
precluding intensive chemotherapy: a history of congestive heart failure for which treatment was 
warranted or an ejection fraction ≤50% or chronic stable angina, a diffusing capacity of the lung for 
carbon monoxide of ≤65%, and an ECOG of 2 or 3. Patients with previous HMA therapy or chemotherapy 
for MDS were excluded, as well as those with favourable cytogenetic risk.  
The primary endpoints were OS and composite complete remission rate (CR+CRi). Note that for the US, 
the primary endpoint was OS. The secondary endpoints were rate of CR, rate of CR and CRh, proportion 
of patients achieving composite complete remission (CR or CRi) by initiation of cycle 2, DOR, transfusion 
independence rate, MRD response rate, fatigue improvement and PRO assessments and EFS.  
The study was randomized 2:1 (287:146). The stratification factors were age, region and cytogenetics. 
The primary analysis for CR + CRi was to occur 6 months after the first 225 subjects were randomized. 
Region will not be included in the stratified efficacy analysis since it is not considered as a prognostic 
factor. A significance level of 0.01 out of 0.05 (two-sided) was to be allocated for this analysis (the rest, a 
0.04 significance level was allocated to the OS analysis). The intention-to-treat population included all 
431 patients who underwent randomization.  
Venetoclax was administered orally, once daily. For mitigation of the tumor lysis syndrome during cycle 1, 
the dose of venetoclax was 100 mg on day 1 and 200 mg on day 2; on day 3, the target dose of 400 mg 
was reached and continued until day 28. In all subsequent 28-day cycles, the dose of venetoclax was 
initiated at 400 mg daily. Azacitidine at a dose of 75 mg/m2 sc or iv was administered in both arms on 
days 1-7 of every 28-day cycle.   
Bone marrow assessments were performed at screening, at the end of cycle 1, and every three cycles 
thereafter until two consecutive samples confirmed a complete remission or a complete remission with 
incomplete hematologic recovery. Patients continued to receive treatment until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxic effects, until they withdrew consent, or until they met any protocol-defined criteria. 
Except for patients who withdrew consent, all patients who discontinued a trial regimen were followed for 
survival.

Study M16-043 – venetoclax + LDAC vs placebo + LDAC 
This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 study enrolled patients between May 2017 and 
November 2018 across 76 sites. The data cut-off for the primary analysis was February 2019. An 
additional post-hoc follow-up analysis was performed 6 months later (August 2019).  
Patients age ≥18 years with previously untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy were 
enrolled. Patients were considered ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy if they were age ≥75 
years or age 18-74 years and fulfilled at least 1 criterion associated with lack of fitness for intensive 
induction chemotherapy, including: ECOG 2 to 3, cardiac history of congestive heart failure requiring 
treatment or ejection fraction ≤50% or chronic stable angina, diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon 
monoxide ≤65%, creatinine clearance 30-45 mL/min, moderate hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 
1.5 to 3 x ULN. Patients with secondary AML with or without prior treatment with HMAs for MDS were 
included; those with secondary AML from underlying myeloproliferative neoplasms were not. Exclusion 
criteria included prior therapy for AML (except hydroxyurea before or during the first cycle of study 
treatment) and any previous exposure to cytarabine for any indication.  
The primary objective was OS, while secondary objectives were complete remission (CR); CR+CR with 
partial hematologic recovery (CRh); CR plus CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi); proportion 
of patients with CR/CRi and CR/CRh by initiation of therapy cycle 2; rate of transfusion independence; 
event-free survival (EFS); minimal residual disease (MRD); response rates and OS in the subsets of 
patients with mutations in NPM1, IDH1/2, FLT3, or TP53; and PROs.  
The planned sample size was 210 patients randomized 2:1(143:68); 133 events were required to be 
observed at the time of the primary analysis. The study was designed to detect a 45.5% reduction in 
mortality with 90% power and a significance level with 2-sided a of 0.05. An interim analysis was planned 
when 75% of death events occurred. The O’Brien-Fleming boundary was used to control the type 1 error 
rate at 0.05 (2 sided). Randomization was stratified by AML status (secondary vs de novo), age (18 to75 
vs ≥75), and region. A number of unplanned analyses were performed to further explore the inconclusive 
OS results from the primary analysis and a post-hoc interim analysis with an additional 6 months of 
patient follow-up was added. The pre-planned procedure to control the type 1-error at 2-sided 5%-level 
will not hold. Accordingly, these post-hoc analyses to explore the OS outcome increase the risk of a false 
positive conclusion. 
Venetoclax administration began at 100 mg on day 1 and increased stepwise over 4 days to reach the 
target dose of 600 mg (100, 200, 400, and 600 mg); dosing was continued at 600 mg per day from day 4 
through day 28 and for all subsequent cycles. LDAC 20 mg/m2 sc daily was administered in both arms on 
days 1 to 10 for all cycles. Patients could continue receiving treatment until progression or until study 
treatment discontinuation criteria were met. Patients remained on study for OS assessment and follow-
up, even if they initiated additional lines of treatment.  
Response assessments were performed after cycle 1 (patients with resistant disease after cycle 1 had 
repeat assessments after cycle 2 or 3 to observe the initial CR/CRi response) and every 3 cycles 
thereafter (starting at the end of cycle 4 and continuing until PD) until 2 consecutive samples confirmed 
CR or CRi. Assessments were also performed if there was suspected relapse and/or at the final study 
visit.  
Efficacy data  
Study M15-656 – venetoclax + AZA vs placebo + AZA 
In both groups, the median age was 76 years, and 60% of the patients were male; 61% of patients were 
≥75 yo. Secondary AML was reported in 25.2% of the patients in the experimental arm and in 24.1% of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

the patients in the control group, and poor cytogenetic risk was reported in 36.4% and 38.6%, 
respectively. In all, 141/286 patients in the experimental arm and 65/145 in the control arm had at least 
two reasons for ineligibility for intensive therapies.  
The median duration of exposure in the experimental arm was 7.6 months (range: 0.1-30.7) and in the 
control arm 4.3 months (range: 0.1-24). Patients received venetoclax for a median of 7 cycles (range: 1-
30) versus 4.5 cycles (range: 1-26) in the comparator arm. 
The most common reason for trial discontinuation during the follow-up for survival was death: 161 
patients (56%) in the venetoclax + azacitidine arm and 109 patients (75%) in the control group. The 
reasons for deaths, especially as DP, should be tabulated and presented, as the participant flow does not 
clarify this issue.  
Regarding the primary endpoint (OS), the median duration of follow-up was 20.5 months (range, <0.1 to 
30.7). At the time of the analysis, 73 of the patients in the experimental arm and 16 of the patients in the 
control group remained on study treatment. The median overall survival was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.9-
18.7) in the venetoclax + azacitidine arm and 9.6 months (95% CI 7.4-12.7) in the control group (HR 
0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85). 
Composite complete remission (CR+CRi) was achieved in 66.4% of the patients in the venetoclax + 
azacitidine arm and 28.3% of the patients in the control group; CR+CRi before the initiation of cycle 2 
was achieved in 43.4% vs 7.6% of patients, respectively.  
The median time to first response (either CR or CRi) was 1.3 months (range 0.6 to 9.9) and 2.8 months 
(range, 0.8 to 13.2), respectively. The median duration of CR+CRi was 17.5 months (95% CI 13.6-NR) in 
the venetoclax + azacitidine arm and 13.4 months (95% CI 5.8-15.5) in the control group.  
CR was achieved in 36.7% and 17.9% of the patients, respectively, and the duration of CR was 17.5 
months vs 13.3 months. Similarly, CR+CRh was achieved in 64.7% of the patients in the venetoclax + 
azacitidine arm and in 22.8% of those in the control group; this endpoint was reached before the 
beginning of cycle 2 in 39.9% vs 5.5% of patients, respectively.  
The median time to first response was 1 month (range, 0.6-14.3) and 2.6 months (range, 0.8-13.2), and 
the duration of response was 17.8 months (95% CI 15.3-NR) and 13.9 months (95% CI 10.4-15.7), 
respectively.  
The incidence of post-baseline transfusion independence was higher among patients in the venetoclax + 
azacitidine arm than the control group. Red-cell transfusion independence occurred in 59.8% vs 35.2%, 
while platelet transfusion independence occurred in 68.5% vs 49.7%, respectively. 
In the analysis of the molecular subgroups, the combination of azacitidine plus venetoclax was associated 
with a higher rate of CR+CRi than with aza alone. In patients with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, the CR+CRi 
rate was 75.4% in the venetoclax + azacitidine arm and 10.7% in the control group; in those with FLT3 
mutations, the CR+CRi rate was 72.4% vs 36.4%, respectively; in those with NPM1, 66.7% vs 23.5%, 
respectively; and in those with TP53, 55.3% and 0%, respectively.  
In patients who achieved CR+CRi, MRD negativity was observed in 23.4% of the patients who received 
venetoclax + azacitidine and in 7.6% of those in the control group. 
The median overall survival among patients with de novo AML (i.e., in those with no history of MDS, 
myeloproliferative disorder, or exposure to potentially leukemogenic agents) was 14.1 months in the 
venetoclax + azacitidine arm and 9.6 months in the control group (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.51-0.90). The 
mOS among patients with secondary AML was 16.4 months and 10.6 months, respectively (HR 0.56; 
95% CI 0.35-0.91). Among patients with an intermediate cytogenetic risk, the median overall survival 
was 20.8 months in the venetoclax + azacitidine arm and 12.4 months in the control group (HR, 0.57; 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021 
Page 92/132 
 
 
 
 
95% CI 0.41-0.79), whereas in those with a poor cytogenetic risk, the mOS was 7.6 months and 6 
months, respectively (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.54-1.1). 
The median event-free survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.4-11.8) in the venetoclax + azacitidine arm 
and 7 months (95% CI 5.6-9.5) in the control group (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80). In CR+CRi with MRD 
<10-3, OS at 24 months was 73.6% in the experimental arm and 63.6% in the control group. 
In patients with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations at baseline, overall survival at 12 months was 66.8% among 
those in the venetoclax+azacitidine arm, as compared with 35.7% among those in the control group (HR 
0.35; 95% CI 0.20-0.60). 
Supporting phase 1b study M14-358 
Only 31 patients received venetoclax + decitabine in this early phase, non-randomized study, to support 
this particular combination in the application dossier, since study M15-656 did not include patients 
treated with venetoclax and decitabine.  
In patients who received venetoclax at the proposed dose of 400 mg in combination with decitabine, the 
CR + CRi rate was 74.2%, with a CR rate of 54.8% and a CRi rate of 19.4%. The median duration of CR 
+ CRi was 15 months (95% CI: 7.2, 30 months). In subjects treated with 400 mg venetoclax in 
combination with decitabine, mOS was 16.2 months (95% CI: 9.1, 27.8 months) with a minimum 
duration of study follow up of 40 months.  The rate of transfusion independence for RBC was 61.3% and 
for platelets 87.1%, with a duration of transfusion independence of 110 days for both RBC and platelets.  
The extrapolation of effect between the two HMAs, decitabine and azacitidine, when adding venetoclax,is 
supported by their similar mechanism of action. 
Study M16-043 – venetoclax + LDAC vs placebo + LDAC 
For the primary analysis, the median treatment duration was 3.9 months with a median of 4 cycles 
delivered in the experimental arm, vs. 1.7 months and 2 cycles, respectively. The median follow-up time 
was 12 months for both arms. Post-study therapy was received by 33 (23%) of 143 patients in the 
venetoclax + LDAC arm and 30 (44%) of 68 in the placebo arm. No patients went on to stem cell 
transplantation after study treatment.  
The primary reasons for discontinuation of study drug (venetoclax plus LDAC, n=105/143, vs placebo 
plus LDAC, n=61/68) were: treatment failure (12% vs 19%), PD (11% vs 16%), death (12% for both), 
withdrawal of consent (6% vs 10%), AEs not related to disease progression (9% for both), AEs related to 
disease progression (4% for both), physician decision (5% vs 12%), morphologic relapse (13% vs 4%), 
and other (4% vs 3%). The reasons for deaths, especially as PD, should be tabulated and presented, as 
the participant flow does not clarify this issue.  
As for demographics and clinical characteristics of patients enrolled in the study, the median age was 76 
years, 32.8% had poor cytogenetic risk, 38.4% had secondary AML, 19.9% had prior HMA exposure, and 
baseline mutations in TP53, FLT3, IDH1/2, or NPM1 were detected in 18.9%, 17.7%, 20.1%, and 15.9% 
of patients (in whom data were available), respectively. Baseline characteristics had similar frequencies 
between arms, except for the rates of secondary AML from EDC (40.6% vs 33.8%), which were more 
frequent in the venetoclax arm. 
At the time of the primary analysis, 38/143 and 7/68 patients were alive in the experimental and control 
arm, respectively. The mOS was 7.2 months (95% CI 5.6-10.1) vs 4.1 months (95% CI 3.1-8.8), with a 
HR of 0.749 (95% CI 0.52-1.07). The primary endpoint OS was not met at the time of pre-planned 
analysis. Imbalances in baseline characteristics (secondary AML, prior hematologic disorder–related 
secondary AML, and poor cytogenetic risk) between the randomized arms, as well as increased

administrative censoring in the venetoclax arm before the median OS time, may have affected the 
analyses, according to the MAH.   
A post-hoc analysis with an additional 6 months of patient follow-up, now with a majority of patients 
censored in both arms beyond the median OS time, showed an increase in the mOS in the venetoclax 
arm (8.4 months vs the same 4.1 months for control), with an HR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.50-0.99); however 
type 1-error control was lost. Furthermore, it is notable that the driver of making this analysis apparently 
“positive”, is a drift in the HR estimate rather than increased power due to 20 more events. 
At the time of the primary analysis, CR/CRi was achieved in 47.6% of patients in the venetoclax arm, 
compared with 13.2% in the placebo arm, with CR achieved in 27.3% and 7.4% of patients, respectively. 
The median DoR of CR was 11 months. Responses were also achieved more rapidly with addition of 
venetoclax, with CR/CRi before initiation of cycle 2 observed in 34.3% vs 2.9%.  
The median EFS was of 4.7 months (95% CI 3.7-6.4) vs 2 months (95% CI 1.6-3.1), HR 0.58.  
As for transfusion independence, the RBC rates were 40.6% vs 17.6% in favour of the experimental arm, 
and 47.6 vs 32.4%, for platelets. Upon confirmation of morphologic CR or CRi, only 6% (8 of 143) of 
those in the venetoclax arm and 1% (1 of 68) of those in the placebo arm had a flow cytometric MRD 
level of <0.1%. 
Response rates and OS times were also determined for subsets of patients with baseline intermediate or 
poor cytogenetic risk, somatic mutations in TP53, IDH1/2, FLT3, or NPM1, and key baseline prognostic 
factors. A longer OS for the experimental arm was observed in these (small) subgroups, with the 
exception of mutant FLT3, which were detected in 29 patients: 9 in the control arm and 20 in the 
experimental arm. Among the FLT3 mutation–positive patients in the placebo arm, 3 had coexisting NPM1 
mutations, and all 3 (100%) such patients achieved CR/CRi; among the 20 FLT3 positive patients in the 
venetoclax arm, 6 had coexisting NPM1 mutations and the 5 patients treated achieved CR/CRi; in 
contrast, only 4 of the remaining 14 (29%) FLT3 patients without NPM1 mutations achieved CR/CRi, with 
a median OS of 2.2 months. Similarly, mOS for patients with coexisting FLT3 and NPM1 mutations was 
10.2 months in the placebo arm and not yet reached in the venetoclax arm. 
No PRO improvements were observed in the experimental arm. 
Supporting phase 1/2 study M14-387. Venetoclax+LDAC 
This was a study venetoclax in combination with low-dose cytarabine in treatment-naïve subjects with 
acute myelogenous leukemia who are ≥ 60 years of age and who are not eligible for standard 
anthracycline-based induction therapy. In subjects treated with venetoclax (600 mg target dose) in 
combination with LDAC (n=82), ORR was 54.9% (45/82). The CR+CRi rate was 53.7% with a CR rate of 
25.6%. The median duration of CR was 15 months. 
The efficacy of venetoclax as an add-on to azacitidine was demonstrated in the M15-656, and the 
magnitude of add-on efficacy was clinically relevant. Furthermore, due to the similarity of the 
pharmacology of azacytidine and decitabine, corroborated by a single arm study in the latter combination, 
the positive B/R shown in M15-656, is extended to the combination with decitabine. 
The efficacy in combination with LDAC is more complicated. The M16-043 study was not positive on its 
primary endpoint, OS. An updated analysis with 153 rather than 133 events, shows a drift in the HR from 
0.75 to 0.70, and a p-value of 0.04. In response to the list of questions, the Applicant provided a second 
updated OS analysis with 12 months additional follow up data. At this second updated analysis, the HR 
was similar to the first updated analysis at 6 months follow up: HR 0.709, with a p-value of 0.038. Both 
updated analyses are however not alpha-protected and cannot be understood simply as a more powered 
analysis, since the reason for its “positivity” is not the accrual of events but a swaying HR in a small 
sample; however, a detrimental effect may be excluded.

The M16-043 study showed an increment of CR from 7% to 27% when adding venetoclax to LDAC, with a 
median DoR of 11 months. This is not alpha protected but demonstrates the significant contribution of 
venetoclax to sum regimen activity. The CR rate is a replication of what was found in the phase 1 M14-
387 study where the CR rate was 25% and a median DoR of 15 months. 
Additional experts consultation 
The CHMP consulted the Scientifc Advisory group Oncology (SAG) on the following question: 
In study M16-043 (Viale-C), the clinical benefit of adding venetoclax to LDAC could not be established on 
overall survival (the primary endpoint), by the commonly accepted statistical standard of evidence. Do 
you, notwithstanding this, consider that the clinical benefit of this combination has been established in 
the target population (first line AML patients not eligible for intensive chemotherapy)? If so, what is the 
basis of your inference? 
The SAG noted the primary efficacy analysis of study M16-043 (VIALE-C) of venetoclax in combination 
with low dose cytarabine (LDAC) for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in patients not 
eligible for intensive chemotherapy. The trial included 19.9% of patients with prior hypomethylating 
agents exposure. 
The primary analysis did not allow rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference in overall survival (OS), 
with a logrank p-value of 0.114, and a HR of 0.749 (95% CI 0.52-1.07).  
The reported p-value of .04 for a more mature subsequent secondary analysis has to be interpreted in 
the light of lack of multiplicity adjustment and does not allow to conclude formally that there is a 
statistically significant difference between treatment groups.  
Therefore, the SAG concurred that the study failed to show a statistically significant difference in OS for 
venetoclax+LDAC v. placebo+LDAC, and that the stated primary objective of the trial was not met. 
The assessment benefited of a well-conducted randomized clinical trial for which effort the sponsor has to 
be recognised.  
The SAG discussed the possible reasons for this outcome, including true lack of effect v. an over-
ambitious expected treatment effect on OS (HR=.55) resulting in relatively few events for the primary 
analysis (N=133). However, such reasons would only be hypothesis-generating and cannot make up for 
the lack of demonstrated effect.  
Notwithstanding the lack of a demonstrated effect on OS based on the primary efficacy analysis, the SAG 
considered secondary analyses of OS and secondary endpoints like complete response rate of 27.3% v. 
7.4% and transfusion-independence of 37.1 v. 16.2, for venetoclax + LDAC versus placebo + LDAC, 
respectively. Thus, the available information also clearly showed that venetoclax was associated with 
anti-tumour activity when used in combination with LDAC but the SAG concluded that there was 
considerable uncertainty about the overall significance of the activity in terms of patient benefit.  
A number of efficacy subgroup analyses were submitted and these may potentially be helpful in exploring 
homogeneity of effect, identifying subgroups with clearly higher activity (or lack thereof, fully 
acknowledging the lack of power to detect small effects due to the small sample size of the trial, N= 143 
v 68 for venetoclax+LDAC and placebo+LDAC, respectively).  
These analyses failed to identify any subgroups with clearly outstanding effect. Conversely, they failed to 
show any detectable effect in terms of OS in certain subgroups like patients with prior treatment with 
hypomethylating agents (HR=.81), FLT3 mutation (HR=1.11), patients with poor cytogenetic risk 
(HR=1.04), or good (ECOG <2) performance status (HR=.95). Thus, subgroup analyses presented did 
not allow to suggest a clinically relevant effect even in a subgroup of patients.

EMA/280804/2021 
Page 95/132 
 
 
 
 
The SAG also noted that it is difficult to draw supporting evidence from other trials with venetoclax due to 
the different settings and populations, especially since the trials were run in parallel with likely selection 
bias. 
In conclusion, the SAG agreed that the nature and magnitude of anti-tumour activity observed on the 
basis of complete response and associated transfusion independence was of doubtful clinical significance 
and the subgroup analyses presented failed to identify any patients with a clear effect. Overall, no 
clinically relevant benefit has been established in the target population or any of the subgroups 
considered, based on primary and secondary analyses of efficacy and anti-tumour activity.  
While agreeing on the overall conclusions, a few SAG members expressed that given the favourable and 
consistent signs of activity observed, venetoclax + LDAC might be a useful treatment option for some 
patients in whom hypomethylating agents cannot be used, although they agreed that it was difficult to 
identify, based on evidence, what characteristics would define such patients, and that statistically 
rigorous evidence of efficacy to justify the addition of venetoclax to standard LDAC is lacking.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clinically relevant benefit of venetoclax in terms of OS gain has been established in combination with 
azacitidine, and by extrapolation with decitabine in patients who are ineligible for intensive 
chemotherapy. 
With regards to the combination with LDAC, efficacy has not been established based on the primary 
endpoint, OS. A SAG on the 30th March did not support the notion that clinical benefit has been 
established based on a secondary endpoint such as CR.

Among subjects in Study M15-656 treated with placebo in combination with AZA, median duration of 
placebo was 4.3 months (range, 0.1 to 24.0 months).  Subjects receiving placebo in combination with 
AZA also received a median of 3.8 months of AZA (range, 0.1–23.4 months).  Among subjects in this 
study treated with venetoclax 400 mg in combination with AZA, median duration of venetoclax was 7.6 
months (range, 0.0 to 30.7 months).  Subjects receiving venetoclax in combination with AZA also 
received a median of 7.0 months of AZA (range, 0.0–30.5 months). 
In Study M14-358, 84 subjects received venetoclax 400 mg in combination with AZA and 31 subjects 
received venetoclax 400 mg in combination with DEC.  The median duration of venetoclax among 
subjects receiving the 400 mg dose was 6.4 months (range, 0.1–38.1 months) in combination with AZA 
and 5.7 months (range, 0.5–41.8 months) in combination with DEC.   
When exposure is considered in number of cycles, median duration of venetoclax (400 mg) in 
combination with AZA was 6 cycles (range, 1 to 37 cycles).  These subjects received a median of 4.0 
cycles of AZA (range, 1–29 cycles).  Among 31 subjects treated with venetoclax (400 mg) in combination 
with DEC, median duration of venetoclax was 6 cycles (range, 1–38 cycles). 
Among subjects in Study M16-043 treated with placebo in combination with LDAC, as of the data cut-off 
date, median duration of placebo was 1.7 months (range, 0.1 to 20.2 months); median number of cycles 
was 2.0 (range, 1.0 to 21.0 cycles). Subjects receiving placebo in combination with LDAC also received a 
median of 1.3 months of LDAC (range, 0.0–19.9 months).  Among subjects in this study treated with 
venetoclax 600 mg in combination with LDAC, median duration of venetoclax was 4.1 months (range, 0.0 
to 23.5 months); median number of cycles was 4.0 (range 1 to 22).  Subjects receiving venetoclax in 
combination with LDAC also received a median of 3.5 months of LDAC (range, 0.0–23.4 months). 
In Study M14-387, 82 subjects received venetoclax 600 mg in combination with LDAC.  Median duration 
of venetoclax among subjects receiving the 600 mg dose was 4.2 months (range, 0.2–41.8 months) in 
combination with LDAC.  When evaluated based on number of treatment cycles, the subjects who 
received venetoclax (600 mg) with LDAC had a median duration of 5 cycles of venetoclax (range, 1–43 
cycles).  These subjects received a median of 3 cycles of LDAC (range, 1 – 36 cycles).

The majority of subjects in the ongoing studies had discontinued venetoclax as of the database version 
dates for those individual studies. The common primary reasons for venetoclax discontinuation (reported 
for > 10% of subjects in any venetoclax treatment group) were AE not related to progression, 
investigator request, progressive disease, morphologic relapse, treatment failure, death, and other 
reasons (hematopoietic stem cell transplant, logistical reasons).  Among subjects who received placebo, 
the common reasons for placebo discontinuation were investigator request, progressive disease, withdrew 
consent, treatment failure, and death. 
The common primary reasons for study discontinuation (reported for > 10% of subjects in any venetoclax 
treatment group) were death, AE not related to progression, progressive disease with or without death, 
and other reasons.  Among subjects who received placebo, the most common reason for study 
discontinuation was death. 
As of the respective study cutoff dates, 118 subjects treated with venetoclax in combination with AZA 
(Study M15-656, n = 109; Study M14-358, n = 9), 3 subjects treated in combination with DEC (Study 
M14-358, n = 3), and 43 subjects treated in combination with LDAC (Study M16-043, n = 39; Study 
M14-387, n = 4), remained ongoing for continuation of treatment, disease progression and/or survival 
follow-up.  Also ongoing for disease assessment and/or survival follow-up were 31 subjects treated with 
placebo in combination with AZA (Study M15-656) and 12 subjects treated with placebo in combination 
with LDAC (Study M16-043).

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
•  Hematologic adverse events 
Hematologic adverse events including severe neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are expected 
features of the AML disease process and are common AEs reported in AML patients receiving HMA or 
LDAC as monotherapy or in combination with venetoclax.  At baseline across all studies, approximately 
50% of the subjects had ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia, 40% had ≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and 30% had 
Grade 3 anemia.  Grade ≥ 3 AEs with preferred terms in the Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders SOC 
were reported for ≥ 70% of subjects treated with venetoclax at the target doses in combination with AZA, 
DEC, and LDAC in each of the Phase 3 and Phase 1 studies.  Similarly, ≥ 68% of subjects who received 
placebo in combination with HMAs or LDAC in the Phase 3 studies also had Grade ≥ 3 AEs in this SOC. 
Neutropenia

In Study M15-656, a higher percentage of subjects receiving venetoclax in combination with AZA 
reported AEs in the neutropenia search compared to subjects receiving placebo with AZA (71.0% and 
44.4%, respectively). A greater percentage of subjects in the venetoclax plus AZA treatment arm 
reported febrile neutropenia (41.7% and 18.8%, respectively) compared to the placebo with AZA 
treatment arm. AEs ≥ Grade 3 within the neutropenia search (subset for selected adverse events) were 
reported in a higher percentage of subjects in the venetoclax plus AZA treatment arm compared to the 
placebo plus AZA treatment arm (70.7% versus 43.1%, respectively). Incidence of serious AEs within the 
neutropenia search (subset for selected adverse events) was higher among subjects in the venetoclax 
with AZA treatment arm compared to those in the placebo with AZA treatment arm (33.6% and 11.8%, 
respectively). 
In Study M16-043, a higher percentage of subjects receiving venetoclax in combination with LDAC 
reported AEs in the neutropenia search (subset for selected AEs) compared to subjects receiving placebo 
with LDAC (68.3% and 45.6%, respectively). A generally similar percentage of subjects in the venetoclax 
and placebo treatment arms reported febrile neutropenia (32.4% and 29.4%, respectively) and 
neutrophil count decreased (7.0% and 4.4%, respectively). 
•  Serious infections 
Serious events within the SOC of Infections and Infestations were reported for 57.2% of subjects 
receiving venetoclax with AZA in Study M15-656, compared with 43.8% of subjects receiving placebo 
with AZA.  In Study M16-043, serious infections were reported for 37.3% of subjects treated with 
venetoclax in combination with LDAC and for a similar percentage of subjects treated with placebo and 
LDAC (36.8%).  Pneumonia was the most common individual SAE of infection in both treatment arms.   
Infections led to venetoclax discontinuation in approximately 7% to 12% of subjects treated with 
venetoclax combination with HMAs or LDAC and in approximately 7% to 9% of subjects treated with 
placebo in combination with AZA or LDAC.  Approximately 6% to 15% of subjects treated with venetoclax 
combination with HMAs or LDAC had infections that led to death; infections leading to death were similar 
among subjects who received placebo with AZA (7.6%) or LDAC (10.3%). 
In Study M15-656, SAEs within the SOC of Infections and Infestations were reported in 63 subjects 
(43.8%) treated with placebo in combination with AZA; the most common SAEs (affecting ≥ 5% of 
subjects) in this treatment arm included PTs of pneumonia (22.2%) and sepsis (8.3%).  SAEs within the 
SOC of Infections and Infestations were reported in 162 subjects (57.2%) treated with venetoclax in 
combination with AZA; the most common SAEs in this treatment arm included PTs of pneumonia (16.6%) 
and sepsis (5.7%). 
In Study M16-043, SAEs within the SOC of Infections and Infestations were reported in 25/68 subjects 
(36.8%) treated with placebo in combination with LDAC; SAEs affecting ≥ 5% of subjects in this 
treatment arm included pneumonia (10.3%), sepsis (5.9%), and septic shock (5.9%).  SAEs of Infections 
and Infestations were reported in 53/142 subjects (37.3%) treated with venetoclax in combination with 
LDAC; the most common SAEs in this treatment arm included the PTs of pneumonia (14.1%) and sepsis 
(5.6%). 
•  Tumour Lysis Syndrome: 
In Study M15-656, among subjects who received placebo or venetoclax 400 mg in combination with AZA, 
0 and 3 (1.1%) subjects respectively reported events of TLS, all of which occurred during ramp up and 
within the 7 days of study drug administration in Cycle 1.  
In Study M16-043, no events of TLS were reported among subjects who received placebo in combination 
with LDAC; 8 AEs of TLS (5.6%) were reported among subjects treated with venetoclax 600 mg in 
combination with LDAC, of which 4 cases were clinical TLS and 4 cases were laboratory TLS.  Of these

events, 7/8 events were reported as ≥ Grade 3 and were associated with death in 2/8 subjects. Both of 
these subjects were considered of high risk: one subject had been hospitalized at the time of initiation of 
therapy and had pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage and pneumonia as additional causes of death, and the 
other subject had renal insufficiency.  
•  Haemorrhage 
The risk of bleeding events (the most frequent of which was epistaxis) appeared to be somewhat 
increased among subjects who received venetoclax in combination with AZA, DEC, or LDAC compared to 
subjects who received placebo in combination with AZA or LDAC.  AEs of any grade defined by a 
Haemorrhages SMQ were reported for 37% to 62% of subjects.  However, Grade ≥ 3 bleeding events 
were reported for only 10.2% and 11.3% of subjects treated at the proposed venetoclax doses in 
combination with AZA or LDAC, and serious events of haemorrhage were reported for < 10% of subjects 
in Studies M15-656 and M16-043 (higher in Study M14-387). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In all studies, SAEs were reported in a majority of subjects treated with venetoclax in combination with 
AZA, DEC, or LDAC at the proposed doses and were not increased compared to subjects treated with 
placebo in combination with AZA or LDAC.  Among subjects who received placebo or venetoclax in 
combination with AZA, SAEs were experienced by 72.9% of subjects who received placebo and by 83.0% 
of subjects who received venetoclax 400 mg in Study M15-656 and by 77.4% of subjects who received 
venetoclax 400 mg with AZA in Study M14-358.  Also in Study M14-358, 80.6% of subjects who received 
venetoclax in combination with DEC experienced SAEs.  Among subjects who received placebo or 
venetoclax in combination with LDAC, SAEs were experienced by 61.8% of subjects who received placebo 
and 66.9% of subjects who received venetoclax 600 mg in Study M16-043, and by 91.5% of subjects 
who received venetoclax 600 mg with LDAC in Study M14-387.

Laboratory findings 
Changes from baseline in haematology and clinical chemistry laboratory values were analyzed over the 
length of the studies.  The data were reviewed, and laboratory changes were assessed for any clinically 
meaningful trends.  Because the studies are ongoing and some subjects remain in follow up, final 
laboratory values will be addressed in the final CSRs after the studies are completed.  No clinically

meaningful trends have been observed for clinical chemistry or hematology variables as of the data cutoff 
dates for these studies.  In both Studies M15-656 and M16-043, a greater proportion of subjects in the 
venetoclax treatment arms had Grade ≥ 3 hemoglobin, low neutrophils, and low platelets compared to 
the placebo treatment arms, in combination with either AZA or LDAC. 
Among subjects treated with venetoclax or placebo in combination with AZA in Study M15-656, no 
clinically important trends were observed for hematology or chemistry variables.  Shifts in hematology 
values from Grades 0 to 2 to Grades 3 to 4, or from Grade 3 to Grade 4, at maximum CTCAE grade were 
observed in ≥ 50% of subjects in each arm for low hemoglobin, low platelets, low leukocytes, and low 
neutrophils, and at least 40% of subjects in each arm for low lymphocytes (venetoclax with AZA, 70.0%; 
placebo with AZA, approximately 40%).  In Study M15-656, more subjects who received venetoclax 
versus placebo, in combination with AZA, had Grade 3 or 4 low hemoglobin (57.1% vs 52.1%), low 
platelets (87.5% vs 80.4%), low leukocytes (95.7% vs 67.7%), low neutrophils (97.6% vs 81.2%), and 
low lymphocytes (70.9% vs 39.4%). 
A greater proportion of subjects receiving venetoclax with AZA compared to placebo with AZA 
experienced increased bilirubin both overall (53.2% vs 39.6%) and Grade 3 or 4 (7.4% vs 4.2%).   
Among subjects treated with either venetoclax or placebo in combination with LDAC in Study M16-043, 
shifts from Grades 0 to 2 to Grades 3 to 4, or from Grade 3 to Grade 4, were observed for low potassium 
(16.9%, venetoclax with LDAC; 17.6% placebo with LDAC) high glucose (13.4%, venetoclax with LDAC; 
10.2% placebo with LDAC), and low phosphate (11.9%, venetoclax with LDAC; 19.1% placebo with 
LDAC) (Study M16 043 Interim CSR Table 14.3__4.2.4A).  There were no clinically important trends for 
any of these parameters. 
In Study M16-043, shifts in hematology values were observed in ≥ 50% of subjects in each arm for low 
hemoglobin, low platelets, and low leukocytes, and in ≥ 40% of subjects in each arm for low neutrophils; 
shifts were also observed for low lymphocytes (≥ 40% of subjects receiving venetoclax with LDAC, ≥ 
25% for subjects receiving placebo with LDAC) (Study M16-043 Interim CSR Table 14.3__4.1.4A).  More 
subjects who received venetoclax versus placebo, in combination with LDAC, had Grade 3 or 4 low 
hemoglobin (57.0% vs 54.4%), low platelets (94.7% vs 91.8%), low leukocytes (90.0% vs 65.0%), low 
neutrophils (92.3% vs 73.7%), and low lymphocytes (70.9% vs 27.3%) (Study M16 043 Interim CSR 
Table 14.3__4.1.3A).  Of note, leukocyte count may include circulating leukemia blast cells whereas 
neutrophil count does not include circulating blast cells and is a more specific assessment of neutrophil 
counts.  Accordingly, reductions in leukocytes from baseline may include both subjects who have reduced 
their normal leukocytes as well as subjects who have reduced their leukemic blast cells. 
Laboratory findings in subjects treated with venetoclax in combination with LDAC in Study M14-387 were 
consistent with those in Study M16-043. 
In most subjects, treatment-emergent myelosuppression was adequately managed with dose interruption 
or reduction.  Grade 3 – 4 decreases in hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell count, neutrophils, 
and lymphocytes were common at baseline among subjects treated with venetoclax or placebo in 
combination with AZA or LDAC. 
Subjects with liver enzyme values meeting criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury are discussed.  
It must be noted that many subjects had elevations in bilirubin, likely due to haemolysis as a result of 
repeated red cell transfusions in an AML setting. 
Interpretations of worsening from baseline to the final value are pending since subjects remain in follow 
up on these studies.  These data will be presented in the final CSRs. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Across the studies, there were no clinically meaningful trends or differences between treatment arms in 
subject weight, blood pressure (including diastolic and systolic values), heart rate, or body temperature; 
however, there was a higher incidence of AEs of hypotension in the venetoclax arms of Studies M16-043 
and M15-656 compared with the placebo arms of those studies.  No clinically significant issues were 
noted in other physical findings or observations related to safety. 
No clinically significant ECGs were reported among subjects treated with placebo or venetoclax in 
combination with AZA in Study M15-656; in Study M14 358, 3 subjects who received venetoclax in 
combination with AZA (n = 2) or DEC (n = 1) had clinically significant ECG abnormalities post-baseline, 
none of which were assessed by the investigator as related to venetoclax or any other study drug.  There 
were no reports of ECG abnormalities among subjects who received venetoclax in combination with LDAC 
in Study M6-043; however, 1 subject in this study who received placebo with LDAC had an AE of ECG 
abnormality that was assessed as not related to study drug.  One subject who received venetoclax with 
LDAC in Study M14-387 had a clinically significant ECG abnormality, also assessed as not related to study 
drug. 
Safety in special populations 
Sex 
Some numerical differences were noted in the overall incidence of AEs, Grade ≥ 3 AEs, and SAEs between 
male and female subjects, however there were no differences in the overall safety profile. 
Age 
Of the 283 patients with newly diagnosed AML treated in the VIALE-A (venetoclax + azacitidine arm) 
clinical trial, 96% were ≥65 years of age and 60% were ≥75 years of age. Of the 31 patients treated with 
venetoclax in combination with decitabine in the M14-358 clinical trial, 100% were ≥65 years of age and 
26% were ≥75 years of age. 
The overall incidence of AEs, Grade ≥ 3 AEs, and SAEs was similar between subjects with age < 75 years 
and age ≥75 years treated with venetoclax in combination with AZA in Studies M15-656 and M14-358, or 
with venetoclax in combination with DEC in Study M14-358.  Likewise, overall incidence of AEs, Grade 
≥ 3 AEs, and SAEs was similar between subjects with age < 75 years and age ≥ 75 years treated with 
venetoclax in combination with LDAC in Studies M16-043 and M14-387.Race 
The majority of subjects in Studies M14-358 and M14-387 were white, it is difficult to compare safety 
data on the basis of race. 
Renal function 
Among subjects treated with venetoclax in combination with HMAs, mild to moderate renal impairment 
did not appear to affect the safety profile. 
Among subjects treated with venetoclax in combination with LDAC, no clinically significant differences in 
AE rates were observed among the renal impairment subgroups. 
Hepatic function 
There were no notable differences in safety profile based on hepatic function at baseline. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
To evaluate the impact of co-administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, posaconazole was 
administered in combination with venetoclax 400 mg and DEC in a DDI sub-study (N = 12) as part of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021 
Page 113/132 
 
 
 
 
Study M14-358.  In this substudy, on Cycle 1 Days 21 to 28, a reduced daily dose of venetoclax of 100 
mg or 50 mg was co-administered with posaconazole.  Results from the DDI substudy showed that, with 
venetoclax dose adjustment, the use of posaconazole in patients receiving venetoclax in combination with 
DEC did not negatively affect the safety profile of venetoclax, suggesting that CYP3A inhibitors may 
provide an acceptable risk-benefit profile for subjects who have a medical need for these medications 
while receiving venetoclax as treatment for AML (M14-358 Interim CSR and Summary of Clinical 
Pharmacology Studies [Module 2, Section 2.7.2]). 
The effects of co-administration of CYP3A inhibitors on venetoclax apparent clearance (CL/F) were also 
evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis.  The final model indicated that administration of 
strong CYP3A inhibitors resulted in an approximately 82% decrease in apparent clearance of venetoclax, 
and generally comparable effects of posaconazole versus other strong CYP3A inhibitors. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
None subject in the pivotal studies have discontinued study due to AEs. Treatment with venetoclax was 
discontinued due to AEs by 15.3% and 10.5% of subjects in studies M15-656 and M-16-043 respectively. 
Placebo was discontinued due to Es by 8.9% and 8.8%, respectively.  
Post marketing experience 
Based on post-marketing data to date, the safety profile demonstrated in the clinical trial setting is 
consistent with what has been observed through real-world use.  The most recent Periodic Safety Update 
Report (PSUR), dated 07 February 2020, summarizes interval and cumulative benefit-risk information 
regarding venetoclax for the reporting interval of 05 June 2019 through 04 December 2019.  As of the 
date of the PSUR, the estimated cumulative subject exposure from company-sponsored interventional 
clinical trials for venetoclax was 4,243 patients.  The worldwide post-marketing patient exposure to 
venetoclax was estimated to be 5,964 patient treatment years (PTY) for all approved indications (CLL and 
AML) during the reporting interval.  The estimated cumulative post-marketing patient exposure since first 
approval is 16,784 PTY. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data from two pivotal studies (M15-656 and M15-043) and two supportive studies (M14-358 
and M14-387) are submitted within this type II variation. This safety data was not presented in the 
context of or compared to the aggregate safety data for venetoclax. The applicant has taken conservative 
approach and presented safety data in section 4.8 of the SmPC showing the highest frequency of ADRs 
seen in either CLL or AML studies. However, this approach cannot be supported since some ADRs have 
been reported only in patients with CLL or AML. It is recommended to present ADRs in patients with CLL 
and AML in separate tables or in separate columns of the sane table. 
The safety data for patients with AML are derived from 622 and 212 subjects who received venetoclax or 
placebo, respectively, in combination with AZA, DEC or LDAC. Of these 622 subjects, 398 received 400 
mg of venetoclax and 224 received 600 mg of venetoclax.  
More than half of the patients in pivotal studies were male and older than 75 years and had primary AML. 
Around 40% of patients at baseline had ECOG performance status of 2, and around half of the patients in 
either study or control groups had grade 4 neutropenia, grade 2 anaemia and grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia. The baseline condition should be taken into account assessing safety of venetoclax. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021

The median duration of exposure to venetoclax was longer than to placebo in pivotal studies: 7.0 (0.0-
30.7) and 4.3 (0.1-24.0) months, respectively, in study M15-656, and 4.1 (0.0-23.5) and 1.7 (0.1-20.2) 
months, respectively, in study M16-043. More patients in venetoclax group than in placebo group had 
duration of exposure longer than one year (52 weeks) in both pivotal studies: 37.5% and 20.8% in study 
M15-656, and 16.9% and 7.4%, respectively in study M16-043. 
All or almost all patients in the studies have experienced any AEs, and around 95% of patients have had 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs. Rates and types of adverse events (AEs), Grade 3/4 AEs, and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) reported among subjects with AML who received venetoclax in combination with either HMAs or 
LDAC were generally similar to those reported for subjects who received placebo in combination with AZA 
or LDAC, with a few exceptions. The most common AEs experienced by subjects treated with venetoclax 
at the proposed doses in combination with either HMA or LDAC included gastrointestinal events, febrile 
neutropenia, cytopenias, fatigue, and pneumonia. 
Late onset (> 90 days) AEs of at least grade 3 were hepato-biliary disorders, injury/poisoning/procedural 
complications, and nervous system disorders. The applicant is requested to compare the incidence and 
type of late onset AEs in the CLL studies with the AML studies and discuss whether an SmPC comment is 
deemed necessary. 
Rate of discontinuation, interruption or reduction of venetoclax/placebo due to AEs was similar in the 
pivotal studies. 20.1% and 23.5% discontinued placebo, and 24.4% and 25.4% discontinued venetoclax 
in studies M15-656 and M15-043, respectively. More than half of patients have interrupted venetoclax or 
placebo. Interruption of venetoclax was slightly higher that interruption of placebo. Reduction rate of 
venetoclax or placebo was low and similar between groups. 
SAEs reported in these studies are consistent with what would be expected in an AML population.  
Incidence of SAEs was 5% to 10% higher among subjects who received venetoclax in combination with 
AZA or LDAC compared to subjects who received placebo with AZA or LDAC.  The most common SAEs 
across all treatment groups were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and sepsis. 
Hematologic adverse events including anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia 
were higher in subjects who received venetoclax in combination with AZA or LDAC, compared to those 
who received placebo in combination with AZA or LDAC.  Grade ≥ 3 AEs in the Blood and Lymphatic 
System Disorders SOC were reported for ≥ 70% of subjects treated with venetoclax at the target doses 
and ≥68% of subjects with placebo in combination with AZA, DEC, and LDAC. The assessment of 
hematologic events as risks attributable to venetoclax is complex due to concomitant use of HMA or LDAC 
as well as the disease process of AML.   
Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia was more common in subjects treated with venetoclax in combination with 
AZA, DEC or LDAC than in subjects receiving placebo with AZA or LDAC. Across all venetoclax 
combinations, febrile neutropenia was the primary AE leading to dose interruptions and/or reductions. 
In the phase 3 studies Infection events were reported for 84.5% and 64.8% of subjects treated with 
venetoclax in combination with AZA or LDAC, respectively, compared to subjects treated with placebo in 
combination with AZA (67.4%) or in combination with LDAC (60.3%).  Grade ≥ 3 events of infection were 
reported in 63.6% and 43.0% of subjects who received venetoclax in combination with AZA or LDAC, 
respectively, and were consistent with subjects who received placebo with these agents (51.4% and 
50.0%).  Pneumonia was the most common Grade ≥ 3 infection and serious infection for all treatment 
groups.  Serious events of infection were reported for 57.2% of subjects receiving venetoclax with AZA in 
study M15-656, compared with 43.8% of subjects receiving placebo with AZA; in study M16-043, serious 
infections were reported for 37.3% of subjects treated with venetoclax in combination with LDAC and for 
a similar percentage of subjects treated with placebo and LDAC (36.8%).  Infections led to venetoclax 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021 
Page 115/132 
 
 
 
 
 
discontinuation in approximately 7% to 12% of subjects treated with venetoclax in combination with 
HMAs or LDAC and in approximately 7% to 9% of subjects treated with placebo in combination with AZA 
or LDAC.  Approximately 9% to 15% of subjects treated with venetoclax in combination with AZA or LDAC 
had infections that led to death; in the placebo controlled studies, infections leading to death were 
numerically increased in the venetoclax arm compared with the placebo arm both among subjects who 
received venetoclax or placebo with AZA (9.2% [venetoclax plus AZA] vs 7.6% [placebo plus AZA]) and 
among subjects who received venetoclax or placebo with LDAC (14.8% [venetoclax plus LDAC] vs 10.3% 
[placebo plus LDAC]).   
TLS has not been identified as an important risk in AML subjects treated with venetoclax at the target 
dose in combination with HMAs, (3 events in Study M15-656; 0 events in study M14-358) or LDAC (8 
events in study M16-043; 2 events in study M14-387); 2 fatal events of TLS were reported in subjects 
treated with venetoclax 600 mg in combination with LDAC in Study M16-043.  No events of TLS were 
reported during treatment ramp up in subjects treated with placebo in combination with either AZA or 
LDAC. 
Most Venetoclax treated subjects experienced a TLS event at day 1 or 2 of the dose ramp up and thus at 
a low dose of venetoclax of 20-200 mg. The dose ramp-up for patients with AML differs from that with 
CLL, as dose increase in CLL patients gradually increases per week and for AML in 3/4 days the maximum 
dosage is achieved. The higher than expected incidence of TLS for the combination of venetoclax in AML 
is not caused by the higher final dosage per se, but presumably by the start dose and/or speed of the 
ramp up schedule. The applicant is requested whether data is available, or PK modelling could be used to 
propose a lower starting dose and/or slower ramp up schedule. 
30-day and 60-day mortality rates were similar in venetoclax and placebo groups. The main cause of 
death was disease progression in all patient groups but one – in subjects receiving venetoclax in 
combination with AZA in study M15-656 both disease progression and non-disease progression were main 
causes of death. 
The percentage of subjects with AEs leading to death was similar with the addition of venetoclax to HMA 
or LDAC to the reference therapies, reported for 15.5% to 23.2% of subjects across all studies in subjects 
who were treated with venetoclax at proposed doses in combination with AZA, DEC, or LDAC and for 
20.1% to 20.6% of subjects treated with placebo in combination with AZA or LDAC.  Infections were the 
most common AEs leading to death.  
A part of patients from the study M14-358 receiving venetoclax with DEC participated in DDI study with 
posaconazole. The combination with posaconazole did not negatively affect the safety profile of 
venetoclax. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of venetoclax in patients with AML is overall consistent with what is already known in 
venetoclax treated patients with CLL, however the frequency of some common AEs, neutropenia, febrile 
neutropenia, infections, is higher in AML population. No new safety signal has been identified.  
The section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated accordingly.  
2.6.  Risk management plan

changes to the layout are small. The indications have been separated with new sub-headings. The 
different dosing schemes have been highlighted with sub-headings and different colours for each 
indication in order to ensure correct dosage. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This discussion refers to the combination of venetoclax with a hypomethylating agent (azacitidine or 
decitabine), for the treatment of adult patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who 
are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.  
3.1.2.   Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the 1970s, the ‘7+3’ regimen (7 days of cytarabine and 3 days of anthracycline) became available and 
remains the mainstay of curative-intent standard of care for NDAML. In the last twenty years, new drugs 
such as hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine) have been introduced in the therapeutic arsenal 
for patients considered unfit for standard chemotherapy.  
After a stagnation of decades in the treatment of AML, the recent years witnessed a wave of approvals 
and applications in the US and EU, mostly addressing specific mutations (e.g FLT3 with midostaurin, 
quizartinib, crenolanib, gilteritinib; IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors ivosidenib and enasidenib), improved 
formulations of ‘old’ drugs (Vyxeos, liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicine at a 5:1 molar ratio), 
products targeting tumoral antigens (anti-CD33 gemtuzumab ozogamicin) or specific pathways (HH/GLI 
inhibitor glasdegib). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current extension of indication application includes two randomized, double-blind phase 3 studies for 
newly-diagnosed AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, supported by two phase 1 trials, all 
ongoing: 
•  Study M15-656 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of venetoclax in 
combination with azacitidine versus placebo in combination with azacitidine. Study M14-358 is a 
non-randomized Phase 1b study of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine or decitabine. 
•  Study M16-043 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of venetoclax in 
combination with low-dose cyatarabine (LDAC) versus placebo in combination with LDAC. Study 
M14-387 is a non-randomized phase 1/2 study of venetoclax in combination with LDAC. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study M15-656 – venetoclax + azacitidine vs placebo + azacitidine 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021 
Page 123/132 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The mOS for patients receiving venetoclax + azacitidine was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.9-18.7), in 
comparison with 9.6 months (95% CI 7.4-12.7) in the control group, with a HR of 0.66 (95% CI, 
0.52-0.85). 
The CR+CRi rate was 66.4% (95% CI 60.6-71.9) in the experimental arm vs 28.3% (95% CI 
21.1-36.3) in the control arm.  
•  43% of the patients who received venetoclax + azacitidine had a first response (either CR or CRi) 
before the initiation of cycle 2 (vs 7.6% in the control arm), with a median time to first response 
of 1.3 months for CR (range 0.6 to 9.9) and 2.8 months for CRi (range, 0.8 to 13.2), respectively. 
The median duration of CR+CRi was 17.5 months (95% CI 13.6-NR) in the venetoclax + 
azacitidine arm and 13.4 months (95% CI 5.8-15.5) in the control group.  
• 
• 
• 
The higher remission rates resulted in increases in the incidence of transfusion independence: 
RBC 59.8% in the venetoclax + azacitidine arm compared to 35.2% in the control group; 
platelets: 68.5% and 49.7%, respectively. 
In CR+CRi patients, MRD negativity at 10-3 level was observed in 23.4% (95% CI 18.6-28.8) of 
the patients who received azacitidine plus venetoclax and in 7.6% (95% CI 3.8-13.2) of those in 
the control group. 
The mEFS was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.4-11.8) in the experimental arm and 7 months (95% CI 
5.6-9.5) in the control group (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.50-0.80).  
Study M14-358 – venetoclax in combination with decitabine 
• 
• 
• 
In patients who received venetoclax at the proposed dose of 400 mg in combination with 
decitabine, the CR + CRi rate was 74.2%, with a CR rate of 54.8% and a CRi rate of 19.4%. The 
median duration of CR + CRi was 15 months (95% CI: 7.2, 30 months). 
In subjects treated with 400 mg venetoclax in combination with decitabine, mOS was 16.2 
months (95% CI: 9.1, 27.8 months) with a minimum duration of study follow up of 40 months.  
The rate of transfusion independence for RBC was 61.3% and for platelets 87.1%, with a duration 
of transfusion independence of 110 days for both RBC and platelets.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In Study M15-656 – venetoclax + azacitidine , even if the rate of CR+CRi was improved across AML 
genomic risk groups and these improvements in responses were translated into an increased overall 
survival in some of the evaluated subgroups, most notably among patients with either de novo or 
secondary AML, intermediate cytogenetic risk, and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, these findings should be 
interpreted with caution due the small number of patients in each of these subgroups. It should be noted 
that patients with core-binding factor AML and those who had previously received HMAs were excluded 
from the study.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the risks associated with the combination of venetoclax with an HMA or LDAC are consistent with 
the established safety profiles of the agents and natural history of AML. 
Venetoclax + azacitidine 
All subjects in venetoclax 400 mg + AZA and in placebo + AZA groups experiences AEs. The most 
common AEs experienced in ≥ 20% of AML Subjects receiving venetoclax or placebo were 
thrombocytopenia (45.9% and 40.3% respectively), neutropenia (42.0% and 29.2%, respectively), 
febrile neutropenia (41.7% and 18.8%, respectively), pneumonia (23.0% and 27.1%, respectively). 
TEAEs possibly related to venetoclax or placebo reported in ≥10% of subjects were neutropenia (35.7% 
and 21.5% respectively), thrombocytopenia (33.9% and 22.2% respectively), febrile neutropenia (27.9% 
and 7.6 respectively), and infections (36.7% and 18.1% respectively); ≥Grade 3 AEs reported in ≥10% 
of subjects receiving venetoclax or placebo were thrombocytopenia (44.5% and 38.2% respectively), 
neutropenia (42.0% and 28.5%, respectively), febrile neutropenia (41.7% and 18.8%, respectively), 
pneumonia (19.8% and 25%, respectively). Most important serious AEs reported more often reported in 
venetoclax group were febrile neutropenia, bacteraemia, septic shock, and those reported more often in 
placebo group were pneumonia, sepsis, malignant neoplasm progression.  
Venetoclax + decitabine 
Any AE has been experienced by 90.5% of subjects receiving Venetoclax 400 mg with AZA and by 80.6% 
of subjects receiving venetoclax 400 mg with DEC. TEAEs possibly related to study drug reported more 
often in DEC group were febrile neutropenia (32.3% vs 13.1%), in AZA group were anaemia (21.4% vs 
9.7%), neutropenia (13.1% vs 6.5%), thrombocytopenia (17.9% vs 9.7%). Serious AES reported more 
often in DEC group were febrile neutropenia (41.9% vs 31.0%), bacteraemia (16.1% vs 3.6%), 
pneumonia (29.0% vs 26.2%), sepsis (6.5% vs 3.6%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall the known safety profile was confirmed, and there is one minor uncertainty remaining.  
The majority of subjects experienced a TLS at a low dose of venetoclax of 20-200 mg in the beginning of 
the dose-ramp up. A lower starting dose than 100 mg could be explored, as the CLL starting dose is 20 
mg.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Prolongation of OS has been shown when venetoclax is administered with azacitidine, and, by 
extrapolation, with decitabine.  
No new safety signals were observed; the majority of the TEAE rates are essentially consistent with the 
established safety profiles of the agents and natural history of AML. The risks known to be associated with 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/280804/2021 
Page 129/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the use of Venclyxto (e.g. neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, serious infections) are manageable through 
medical management with routine clinical assessment. 
In conclusion, the OS benefit shown when venetoclax is added to azacytidine or decitabine, outweighs the 
additional toxicity. 
3.7.2.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As regards venetoclax added to LDAC, no OS gain was demonstrated by established standard. A SAG was 
consulted and asked to consider whether clinical benefit could still be considered to have been shown. 
Informed by the SAG consultation, it is not considered that benefits have been established to outweigh 
the additional toxicity. Subsequently, the venetoclax and LDAC combination indication was withdrawn 
from this application. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The B/R of venclyxto for use in combination with azacitidine or decitabine, for the treatment of adult 
patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive 
chemotherapy, is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Extension of indication for Venclyxto (venetoclax) in combination with Hypomethylating Agents (HMAs) 
for the treatment of adult patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are 
ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. As a consequence, Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of 
the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 6.2 of the RMP has also 
been submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make 
minor corrections in the SmPC.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, IIIA and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Venclyxto is not similar to Dacogen, Rydapt, Mylotarg, 
Vyxeos liposomal, Xospata and Daurismo within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module  
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, if there will be one within 2 months from adoption of the CHMP Opinion, or 
prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. If the Commission Decision will be adopted 
within 12 months from CHMP Opinion, the closing sequence should be submitted within 30 days 
after the Opinion. For additional guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for 
eCTD Submissions in the EU. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH 
is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers.

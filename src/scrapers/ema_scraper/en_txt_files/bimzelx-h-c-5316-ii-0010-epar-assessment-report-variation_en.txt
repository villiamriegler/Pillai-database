Extension of indication to include treatment of adults with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis), based on interim results from two interventional and controlled phase III clinical 
studies: AS0010 (BE MOBILE 1) and AS0011 (BE MOBILE 2), which provide evidence of the efficacy and 
safety of bimekizumab in axSpA (nr-axSpA and AS), both compared to placebo treatment. Further 
supportive data is provided by the results of a phase 2a exploratory study (AS0013), a phase 2b, dose-
ranging study (AS0008) and its ongoing follow-on phase 2b open-label extension (OLE) study (AS0009). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package leaflet 
is updated in accordance. Version 1.2 of the RMP has also been submitted. Furthermore, the PI is brought 
in line with the latest QRD template version 10.2 rev.1. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
P/0456/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0456/2020 not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is an umbrella term applied to a family of rheumatic diseases (including axial 
spondyloarthritis [axSpA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA], reactive arthritis, the arthritis of inflammatory bowel 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 8/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease [IBD], and undifferentiated SpA) that have features in common with each other and distinct from 
other inflammatory arthritides, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. 
Axial spondyloarthritis comprises diseases with mainly axial involvement (sacroiliac [SI] joints and spine), 
including: 
• Ankylosing spondylitis (AS; also known as radiographic axSpA [r-axSpA]) requires a diagnosis of 
definite radiographic damage of the SI joints, as demonstrated by radiographic evidence. 
• Nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) where there is no definite radiographic damage on the SI joints. 
The claimed therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication for bimekizumab in nr-axSpA and AS is as follows:  
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) 
Bimzelx is indicated for the treatment of adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with 
objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
Bimzelx is indicated for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have responded 
inadequately or are intolerant to conventional therapy. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
The estimated prevalence of AS ranges from 0.05% to 1.5% (Bohn et al, 2018; Sieper and Poddubnyy, 
2017; Curtis et al, 2016; Strand et al, 2013; Reveille et al, 2012). 
Nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Data are limited on the prevalence of nr-axSpA. A multinational study found that among patients with 
inflammatory back pain, 29% met the criteria for nr-axSpA, with variation in the prevalence by 
geographic region (36% in Asia and 16% in Africa) (Burgos-Vargas et al, 2016). It is estimated that the 
proportion of patients that present with nr-axSpA is similar to that of patients diagnosed with AS; thus, 
the total population of patients with axSpA is at least double the proportion reported for AS (Baraliakos 
and Braun, 2015; van Tubergen, 2015). The prevalence of the disease is highly affected by the 
background prevalence of HLA-B27, its major genetic association (Navarro-Compán et al, 2021). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with nr-axSpA and AS develop their first symptoms in late teenage years to mid-twenties, but 
experience long delays in diagnosis, which impacts the timing of effective treatment. Studies of the Berlin 
early spondyloarthritis clinic records found that the average time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 8 
years for all axSpA patients (Poddubnyy et al, 2012a). 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Patients with AS primarily have inflammatory back pain. The disease typically originates in the sacroiliac 
joints, then progresses to the spine. In the sacroiliac joints and the spine, active inflammation seen on 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 9/230 
 
 
 
 
 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as bone marrow edema (BME) over time results in chronic lesions 
such as erosions, sclerosis, fat lesions, and ankylosis. However, the most characteristic feature is new 
bone formation leading to ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints and syndesmophytes attached to the vertebral 
bodies. As a result of extended syndesmophyte formation, over time the spine may become fused in 
some patients with AS (bamboo spine). Objective signs of inflammation such as BME on MRI, elevated C-
reactive protein (CRP) and genetic features (such as the presence of human leukocyte antigen-B27 [HLA-
B27]) may also be present (Braun, 2012; Rudwaleit et al, 2009c; Braun and Sieper, 2007). 
Disability in AS is related to both the degree of inflammatory activity causing pain, stiffness, fatigue, and 
poor quality of sleep, and to the degree of bony ankylosis, causing loss of spinal mobility and impaired 
physical function. 
Nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Nonradiographic axSpA falls under the umbrella of axSpA and can be seen as an earlier form of axSpA in 
some patients, however, many patients do not develop structural damage on the sacroiliac joints after 
years of symptoms and therefore never progress to AS (Navarro-Compán et al, 2021). Robinson et al. 
(2021) reported rates of progression from nr-axSpA to AS in different cohorts that ranged from 1% to 
12% over 2 years, 6% to 46% over 2 to 9 years, and 26% to 59% over >10 years. Despite lack of 
structural damage on the sacroiliac joint and spine, patients with nr-axSpA have comparable disease 
burden (disease activity, pain, impairments of physical function and quality of life) to those with AS 
(Callhoff et al, 2015; Kiltz et al, 2012). This recognition led to development of the Assessment in 
SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) criteria (Rudwaleit et al, 2009b) to facilitate earlier 
recognition of axSpA and to identify axSpA patients with and without radiographic sacroiliitis according to 
2 possible entry arms: the “imaging arm” (presence of sacroiliitis on radiography or MRI) and the “clinical 
arm” (presence of HLA-B27). 
In both subpopulations and beyond the core signs and symptoms of spinal disease, many patients with 
AS or nr-axSpA experience peripheral manifestations such as peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and to a 
lesser extent, dactylitis and extra-articular manifestations (EAMs) like acute anterior uveitis, IBD, or 
psoriasis (PSO) which is an additional burden affecting these patients’ quality of life (Navarro-Compán et 
al, 2021). Such patients are in need of a holistic treatment approach.  
Many patients continue to suffer from symptoms and residual inflammation despite treatment. This can 
lead to irreversible structural damage and as a consequence to loss of mobility, impact on daily function, 
and quality of life. 
Management 
The goals of treatment of nr-axSpA and AS are to reduce symptom severity, maintain spinal flexibility 
and normal posture, reduce functional limitations, maintain work ability, decrease disease complications, 
and to slow progression of structural damage. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used as first-line treatment and are effective for the 
symptoms (pain and stiffness) of axSpA, but many patients lose or never have clinically meaningful 
response, and structural damage often progresses despite their use. Conventional synthetic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs; e.g., methotrexate [MTX] and sulfasalazine [SSZ]) have no 
proven efficacy in axial disease but may benefit patients with peripheral joint disease. Patients with 
purely axial disease should normally not be treated with cDMARDs; sulfasalazine may be considered in 
patients with peripheral arthritis. Patients who are intolerant or have inadequately responded to NSAIDs, 
or those in whom NSAIDs are contraindicated, have approved treatment options such as tumour necrosis 
factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors. 
EMA/235041/2023

Additionally, the interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine family has been identified as a therapeutic target in axSpA 
and secukinumab as well as ixekizumab, IL-17A monoclonal antibodies, have been approved as treatment 
options in active AS and nr-axSpA. Janus kinase inhibitors (upadacitinib and tofacitinib) have recently 
been approved for the treatment of patients with active AS (upadacitinib and tofacitinib) and nr-axSpA 
(upadacitinib) in the EU. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Bimekizumab is a humanised, full-length monoclonal antibody (mAb) of immunoglobulin G1 subclass with 
2 identical antigen binding regions that selectively bind with high affinity and neutralise IL-17A, IL-17F, 
and IL-17AF cytokines. Antibodies targeting IL-17A cytokines have demonstrated efficacy in patients with 
active axSpA, PSO, and PsA. 
Bimekizumab has been granted marketing authorisation in the EU, for the treatment of moderate to 
severe plaque PSO. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The bimekizumab axSpA phase 2 development program included two Phase 2b studies in study 
participants with AS: AS0008 (completed) to investigate dose-response, efficacy, safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) and its open-label extension (OLE) study AS0009 
(ongoing) to investigate long term safety and efficacy. Data from this Phase 2b study led to dose 
selection of bimekizumab 160mg Q4W for the Phase 3 studies. One exploratory Phase 2a study (AS0013), 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab and certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) in adult study 
participants with active AS. 
The bimekizuamb axSpA phase 3 development program consisted of 2 adequate and well controlled 
pivotal placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies designed in adults with nr-axSpA (AS0010) or AS (AS0011) 
who suffer from moderate to severe active disease. Efficacy is evaluated through the end of the placebo-
controlled Double-Blind Initial Treatment Period at Week 16 and continued for 36 weeks until Week 52 in 
the Maintenance Period in both studies. 
Upon completion of AS0010 and AS0011, eligible study participants could receive continued treatment 
with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W in an OLE study (AS0014; ongoing), to allow the collection of data on the 
long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab. The MAH performed a data cut (20 Dec 2021) 
to provide the most complete data for safety and exposure to bimekizumab at the time of initial 
submission. Study participants who did not enroll into AS0014 entered a 20-week Safety Follow-Up (SFU) 
Period. 
A data cut was taken after the last study participants had their last Week 24 study visit in AS0010 or 
AS0011 and the following analyses of data were initially presented:  
•  All efficacy data up to the Week 24 Visit, ie, including the Week 16 primary analysis time point 
and an additional 8 weeks of treatment in the Maintenance Period up to the Week 24 Visit. 
•  All available safety data at the time of the Week 24 data cut-off, ie, including the 16-week 
Double-Blind Treatment Period and Maintenance Period up to the Week 24 cut-off date. This 
included safety data for all study participants up to their Week 24 Visit as well as all available 
safety data beyond Week 24 for participants who have continued further in the study.  
•  Complete immunogenicity data (anti-drug antibody(ies) [ADAb], and neutralising antibody(ies) 
[NAb]) up to Week 24 (from 100% of study participants) and all available immunogenicity data

(ADAb, NAb) up to Week 52/Early Termination/SFU (representing 69.7% of study participants in 
AS0010 and 75.6% in AS0011; data cut-off: 20 Dec 2021) were provided. 
Prior to initiating the global Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, EMA Scientific Advice was obtained on the initial 
clinical development plan in axSpA in July 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3306/3/2016/II). The overall proposed 
clinical programme for axSpA was considered acceptable by the CHMP at that time. 
Following this interaction and input from the USA FDA, several adjustments were incorporated into the 
programme. Results from the Phase 2b dose-ranging study in AS (AS0008) and the updated Guideline on 
the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Axial Spondyloarthritis 
(EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev. 1), effective 01 May 2018, further informed the development of the Phase 
3 program. 
The revised program was presented to EMA in a follow up Scientific Advice meeting 
(EMEA/H/SA/3306/3/FU/1/2018/II) and was found acceptable. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application. The MAH has cross referenced to data 
submitted in a parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/005316/II/0011) for an extension of indication in psoriatic 
arthritis. The assessment henceforth refers to said data, where relevant, for the proposed indication in 
axial spondyloarthritis, including non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis). 
The data for consideration included primary pharmacodynamic studies relevant to the proposed indication 
and an updated carcinogenicity assessment document (CAD). 
2.2.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro pharmacodynamics 
IL-17F is produced in larger amounts than Il-17A by innate immune cells and independently of Il-23 
Interleukin-17A and IL-17F are produced by cells from the adaptive and innate immune system. Flow 
cytometry was used to examine the capability of mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) and γδ 
T cells (innate immune system) and cluster differentiation (CD)4+ T cells (adaptive immune system) from 
peripheral blood from 5 human donors to produce IL-17A and IL-17F in response to T cell receptor (TCR) 
stimulation with or without IL-12/IL-18 and in the presence or absence of an antibody neutralising IL-23. 
CD8+ MAIT cells produce negligible amounts of IL-17A or IL-17F upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation alone. 
Following addition of IL-12 and IL-18, both cytokines were produced with a strong bias towards IL-17F, 
which is independent of IL-23. The majority of IL-17A and IL-17F produced from CD8+ T cells was shown 
to be issued from MAIT cells (identified as Vα7.2+CD161+CD8+) (Figure 1). 
As MAIT cells, γδ T cells produced very little IL-17A or IL-17F upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation alone and 
produced mainly IL-17F upon addition of IL-12 and IL-18 but independently of the presence of IL-23 
(Figure 2). 
In contrast, CD4+ T cells produced IL-17A and IL-17F upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation alone, which was 
reduced by an IL-23 neutralising antibody.

Figure 1: IL-17A and IL-17F production by MAIT cells  
Figure 2: IL-17A and IL-17F production by γδ T cells 
MAIT cells were significant contributors to the production of total IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF in the 
presence of IL-12/IL-18 whereas CD4 cells were the main contributors under TCR stimulation (Figure 3). 
EMA/235041/2023

Figure 3: Proportion of IL-17A and IL-17F isoforms produced by MAIT, CD4 or γδ T cells as 
compare to totat cells number 
Based on these in vitro experiments, innate-like T cells such as MAIT and γδT cells can produce IL-17A 
and IL-17F, with a bias towards greater IL-17F, upon stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18, which is IL-23 
independent. In contrast, adaptive CD4+ T cells show greater dependency on IL-23. 
Il-17F plays an important role in psoriatic arthritis (Glatt et al, 2018) 
The MAH has demonstrated the presence of both IL-17A and IL-17F in synovial tissue from patients with 
PsA using mRNA expression analysis. The 2 cytokines induce the release of inflammatory mediators by 
signaling through the receptor complex IL17RA/RC present in both synoviocytes and skin cells. Whereas 
neither IL-17A nor IL-17F demonstrate substantial activity by themselves, their potency is significantly 
increased in the presence of TNFα. 
The inhibition of both Il-17A and IL-17F by bimekizumab or a cocktail of antibodies against IL-17A and IL-
17F blocked more effectively the production of IL-8 and MMP3 by synoviocytes from patients with PsA 
stimulated by the supernatant of polyclonal Th17 cells than antibodies selectively inhibiting each of the 
cytokines. Similar results were obtained on the secretion of IL-8 by normal dermal fibroblasts. 
Bimekizumab also induced a more profound down regulation of a large panel of inflammation-related 
genes in synoviocytes and normal human dermal fibroblasts stimulated by Th17 cell supernatants than 
inhibition of IL-17A alone and confirmed a more profound inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis than 
antibodies neutralising selectively each of the cytokines as previously demonstrated (Study 40001876). 
Altogether, the MAH considered that these results suggest that although IL-17F appears to be less potent 
than IL-17A, it plays an important role in chronic inflammation.

Il-17F potently enhances osteogenic differentiation from human periosteum-derived cells and in vitro 
bone formation (Shah et al, 2020) 
The MAH in collaboration with academic groups has demonstrated that IL-17A and IL-17F potently 
enhance osteogenic differentiation from human periosteum-derived cells and in vitro bone formation from 
human periosteal cells that are hypothesised to orchestrate pathological bone formation in AS. These 
effects are more efficiently inhibited by bimekizumab than by the specific inhibition of IL-17A or IL-17F. 
IL-17A and IL-17F induce the transient expression of the periosteal stem cell marker SOSTDC1 indicating 
differentiation away from a ‘stem cell’ phenotype and the simultaneous increased expression of the osteo-
commitment marker RUNX2, the IL-17A and IL-17F receptors and BMP2. The 2 cytokines are 
approximately equipotent in enhancing osteogenic differentiation based on the determination of markers 
SP7, BGLAP, VEGFA and PHOSPHO1. γδ T cells or Th17 cell supernatants (containing IL-17A and IL-17F) 
induce potent increases in all osteogenic markers and in matrix mineralisation in human periosteum-
derived cells. Serum from AS patients also promotes the osteogenic differentiation of human periosteum-
derived cell as suggested by increased RUNX2 expression.  
The dual neutralisation of IL-17A and IL-17F induces a deeper suppression of osteogenic gene expression 
in human periosteum-derived cells than the neutralisation of either cytokine alone, and a suppression of 
matrix mineralisation. Similarly, the pre-incubation of serum from 2 out of 3 AS patients with 
bimekizumab more effectively blocks RUNX2 expression in human periostal derived cells than the 
preincubation with antibodies specific to IL-17A or IL-17F (Shah et al, 2020). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Bimekizumab, as secukinumab, is an IgG1 with a potent Fc function that can be influenced by the 
structure of the N-linked oligosaccharide moiety of the CH2 region of the Fc domain. However, the 
mechanism of action of bimekizumab (binding soluble IL-17A and IL-17F to prevent their interaction with 
the IL-17RA/IL-17RC complex) does not involve the Fc effector function. In these conditions, the risk of 
Fc effector-driven adverse events (cytotoxicity) is low, and the composition of the N-linked 
oligosaccharide moiety is not expected to influence the efficacy or potency (Jiang et al, 2011). The 
absence of risk for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) was nevertheless assessed using in vitro assays. 
ADCC was previously investigated by evaluating the viability of normal human dermal fibroblasts (effector 
cells) pre-stimulated with human IL-17A or IL-17F and cultured with natural killer (NK) effector cells in 
the presence of bimekizumab (Study 40001865). To address a question raised during the review of the 
MA dossier for the PSO indication, the risk of ADCC and CDC was evaluated on IL-17-producing cells. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (IL-17-producing cells) were preincubated with anti-CD28 and anti-
CD3 antibodies and therefore incubated with complement active human serum and increasing 
concentrations of bimekizumab or secukinumab (IgG1 anti-IL-17A, used as negative control). Under the 
experimental conditions, none of the antibodies induced CD4+ IL-17+ T cell depletion; by contrast 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated with complement active human serum and increasing 
concentrations of ocrelizumab or rituximab (with known ADCC and CDC properties for B cells) led to 
depletion of CD20+ B cells (Study 40001929). Results showed that bimekizumab does not elicit Fc 
receptor mediated cytotoxicity, either by ADCC or by CDC on IL-17 effector cells or on IL-17-producing 
cells.

2.2.2.  Toxicology  
Carcinogenicity 
The CAD reviewing the full weight-of-evidence for the role of IL-17A and IL-17F in carcinogenesis and 
tumour progression, the mode of action of bimekizumab, information from in vitro and in vivo tumour 
models, published data from patients with tumours, and published safety data has been updated with 
most recent publications on therapeutic antibodies targeting the IL-17 pathway for the PSO, PsA, and AS 
indications. 
Published safety data from marketed antibodies targeting IL-17A or IL-17RA demonstrated no increased 
risk of tumour so far for PSO, PsA, or AS (Genovese et al, 2020; Combe et al, 2020; Lebwohl et al, 
2021). 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bimekizumab does not contain non-natural amino acids or modifications. It is expected to be subject to 
the same in vivo degradation pathways as natural proteins and to have the same environmental impact 
as naturally occurring human antibodies. According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment on Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides 
and proteins are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Consequently, no Environmental Risk Assessment for bimekizumab is required. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The rationale for IL-17 modification in axial spondyloarthritis is supported by the pharmacodynamic 
studies conducted by the MAH. The predominant secretion of IL-17 from innate immune cells, 
independent of IL-23, may partially explain the failure of targeting IL-23 in axial spondyloarthritis thus 
far. While IL-17A is considered more potent than IL-17F, evidence suggested that they may have equal 
potency in their pro-osteogenic effects. Elevated IL-17 promoted osteogenic markers, including BMP2 and 
RUNX2, the latter of which has been observed at elevated levels in the serum of patients with ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS). IL-17F isoform is predominantly expressed in inflammatory diseases including AS. Pre-
incubation of AS serum with bimekizumab reduced RUNX2 expression to a greater extent than antibodies 
targeting either Il-17A or Il-17F alone. SmPC section 5.1. has been updated accordingly. The 
pharmacodynamic studies discussed provide a solid rationale for the use of bimekizumab in AS. No data 
was submitted specifically in support of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, this is acceptable as the 
update to SmPC relates to the broader mechanism of action of bimekizumab.  
The MAH also provided an update to the Carcinogenicity Assessment Document (CAD). Overall, evidence 
collected in the post-marketing setting including with other Il-17 inhibitors did not indicate an increased 
risk of malignancies in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or AS. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package submitted in support of an indication in axial spondyloarthritis is acceptable. 
Bimekizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In the context of this new indication for the treatment of adults with active axial spondyloarthritis 
(axSpA), additional PK data were collected and submitted by the MAH. Bimekizumab doses ranged from 
16 mg up to 320 mg. 
The Table 1 below gives an overview of the studies contributing data to the AxSpA summary of clinical 
pharmacology:

Bioanalytical methods 
An overview of the bioanalytical methods used for analyses of plasma bimekizumab concentrations (4 
methods), anti-bimekizumab antibody (ADAb) assessments (5 methods), and anti-bimekizumab NAb 
determination (1 method with 2 parts [IL-17AA and IL-17FF specific]) in clinical studies relevant to the 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), and psoriasis (PSO) indications are shown in 
Table 2 (study numbers related to the PsA and axSpA submissions are in bold font).

Table 2: Bioanalytical methods used  
Determination of bimekizumab concentrations in plasma 
Method life cycle information for each of the 4 PK methods is presented in Table 3. PK Method #1 was 
developed and used to analyse samples in Phase 1 studies (except UP0033, UP0034, and UP0067) and all 
PsA, axSpA, and PSO Phase 2 studies (except PA0009). The method is based on coating with anti-
bimekizumab idiotypic antibody and detection with a sheep anti-human IgG1 antibody. PK Method #1 
was updated into PK Method #2 to yield improved robustness going into the Phase 2 studies PA0009 and 
AS0013 (and was also used in the Phase 3 PSO studies). The main improvements for PK Method #2 were 
based on using both coating and detection with anti-bimekizumab idiotypic antibodies and raising the 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to 250ng/mL. For future testing, PK Method #2 was transferred 
successfully to another vendor and validated as PK Method #3. PK Method #3 was used for the Phase 3 
studies in PsA and axSpA as well as the stand-alone study UP0034. PK Method #3 was transferred to a 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 19/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chinese vendor and validated as PK Method #4. Subsequently, PK Method #4 was cross-validated with PK 
Method #3. Thus far, PK Method #4 has only been used in the Chinese Phase 1 study UP0067. PK Method 
#1 and PK Method #2 were cross-validated to facilitate population PK analysis using combined data from 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies.

Antidrug antibody methods 
The ADAb assay was optimised during clinical development with respect to 1) development of a tiered 
analysis approach and changing from quantitative evaluation using a calibrator curve to semi-quantitative 
titer evaluation, and 2) optimisation regarding drug and target tolerance requirements. The ADAb data in 
the clinical studies were generated using bioanalytical methods that were validated according to the 
relevant guidelines at the time of validation. 
In support of the early clinical studies, e.g., PA0007, a homogenous Meso Scale Discovery (MSD)-based 
ADAb assay was used applying a calibration curve (ADAb-1). Presence of ADAb was only evaluated using 
a screening and confirmatory assay (drug displacement assay), no titration was performed. The level of 
ADAb was reported as unit/mL where 1 unit is equivalent to 1μg of calibrator. This assay was validated. 
The ADAb assay was redeveloped and re-established (ADAb-2), which included the transition from 
reporting relative concentration units to implementing a 3-tiered sample analysis approach, consisting of 
a screening assay, confirmatory assay (i.e. drug displacement assay to confirm the true positivity of the 
ADAb-positive samples), and a titration assay to semi-quantify the ADAb responses. This assay was 
validated. 
Subsequently, this assay was improved (ADAb-3) and used in support of Phase 2 studies AS0008, 
AS0009, PA0008, and PA0009. This assay was validated. 
Based on the clinical ADAb data obtained during clinical development, the ADAb assay was further 
optimized to improve target tolerance to allow sensitive detection of treatment emergent ADAb during the 
drug treatment period. This assay was validated (ADAb-4) and used in analysis of samples from AS0013. 
Subsequently, this assay was transferred and validated (ADAb-5) and used in UP0067 and Phase 3 
studies PS0015, AS0010, AS0011, PA0010, PA0011, and PA0012 (including substudy DV0004). 
Supplemental validation was performed to establish additional freeze/thaw stability, drug tolerance 
assessment in the confirmatory tier, and additional positive control qualification. 
Although the same assay was validated at 2 CROs (ADAb-4 and ADAb-5), the ADAb samples within a 
clinical study were analysed by only 1 laboratory. In addition, all samples from the pivotal Phase 3 studies 
were analysed using the same method (i.e. ADAb-5) allowing for the data to be pooled. Therefore, no 
formal reproducibility evaluation was performed to establish full comparison of the data produced by each 
laboratory as the samples within a study were only evaluated by one laboratory. However, as 
demonstrated in Table 4, the assay performance characteristics between both laboratories are 
comparable. 
Statistical assessment of the cut points was performed according to the white paper of Devanarayan et al, 
2017 and screening, confirmatory, and titre cut points were determined. Statistical evaluation was 
performed to evaluate study-specific false positivity rate and to compare validation cut points with those 
assessed in-study.

Determination of neutralising antibodies 
The competitive ligand binding assay (CLBA) method comprised 2 NAb assays, with specificity for IL-17AA 
and IL-17FF, respectively. In these NAb assays, ADAb compete with labelled target to bind to the drug. 
Neutralisation of IL-17AA and IL-17FF binding to the drug is assessed in each respective assay 
separately. Both NAb assays are electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based assays using solid-phase 
extraction with acid dissociation (SPEAD) sample pre-treatment. To remove any interfering drug 
potentially present in the samples, a 2-step acid dissociation was utilised. In the first step, samples were 
acidified to dissociate any potential NAb immune complexes. Biotinylated drug to compete with unlabelled 
drug was added to the acidic solution. The acidic solution was neutralised directly on a streptavidin-
coated high bind plate to capture the biotinylated drug/NAb complexes. After incubation and washing, the 
ADAb/NAb present were dissociated from the biotinylated drug through acidic conditions (second acid 
step; NAb elution). In parallel, streptavidin MSD plates were blocked and coated with a defined amount of 
biotinylated drug. Acidified supernatants were split in halves and transferred to the precoated MSD plates 
for detection with target IL-17AA or IL-17FF, respectively. The acidic supernatants were directly 
neutralised on the respective MSD plates and incubated. Detection of the resulting drug/NAb immune 
complexes was achieved through competition of the NAb with labelled IL-17AA or IL-17FF, respectively. 
Bound target was detected by ECL using an MSD reader. In these CLBAs, potential NAb present in the 
samples will concentration-dependently reduce the ECL signal. This approach assured sufficient drug and 
target tolerance to allow for an accurate determination of NAb levels in clinical samples. In addition, 
specificity testing using an UCB4940 framework control human IgG1 antibody consisting of drug identical 
framework and unrelated complementarity determining regions, demonstrated that the current CLBA 
assays are specific for determining the neutralising capacity of bimekizumab. The neutralising antibody 
assays are only composed of a screening tier. 
The NAb assays were developed and validated. In addition, based on evaluation from the PSO submission 
studies, the NAb assays were partially revalidated to verify the assay sensitivity and the suitability of the 
assay controls. Assay characteristics and detailed summaries of the (re-) validation parameters were 
submitted by the MAH. The NAb methods were used in support of the Phase 3 studies PS0015, AS0010, 
AS0011, PA0010, PA0011, and PA0012.

Bioavailability 
No additional bioavailability or bioequivalence studies have been conducted to specifically support the 
axSpA indication. However, additional considerations for the axSpA (and PsA) indications regarding 
bioavailability are outlined below. 
Study UP0067 
UP0067 was a Phase 1, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled single dose study to evaluate the 
PK, safety, and tolerability of bimekizumab in healthy Chinese volunteers. A total of 36 healthy Chinese 
study participants were randomised and enrolled to 1 of 2 cohorts, bimekizumab 160mg (N=18) or 
320mg (N=18). Within each cohort, study participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 
bimekizumab (N=12) or placebo (N=6) given by subcutaneous (sc) injection. The Pharmacokinetic Per 
Protocol Set (PK-PPS) consisted of all randomised study participants included in the safety set (SS) who 
also completed the study without any important protocol deviations (IPDs) with respect to PK, and had 
plasma concentration data to calculate reliable estimates for the PK variables; 18 study participants were 
included in the PK-PPS.  
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the PK profile of bimekizumab following a single sc 
dose administered in healthy Chinese study participants. The PK sampling time-points were as follows: 
predose, 5h, 24h, 48h, 96h, and at Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 112, and 140.  
As shown in Table 5, increasing bimekizumab dose from 160mg to 320mg led to a proportional increase 
in bimekizumab exposure. For both dose groups, the AUCextr% were <6%, indicating the PK sampling 
captured the terminal elimination phase of bimekizumab well. Across the dose range tested, the tmax, 
Vz/F, t1/2, and CL/F were consistent, with no dose dependency observed.

Following body weight-normalisation, dose proportionality between the two groups was maintained (Table

Table 6: Body weight-normalised pharmacokinetic parameters of bimekizumab (PK-PPS) 
Device use study (DV0004) 
DV0004 was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomised, non-comparator, North America and Europe 
substudy to PA0012. PA0012 is an ongoing study evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of bimekizumab in adult study participants with PsA who completed 1 of the feeder studies 
(PA0010 or PA0011).  
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 25/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the DV0004 substudy, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 self-injecting device 
presentations (ie, 1mL bimekizumab auto-injector [bimekizumab-AI-1mL] and 1mL bimekizumab safety 
syringe [bimekizumab-SS-1mL]) and self-administered bimekizumab at Baseline and at Week 4 in the 
thigh or abdomen. Within each device presentation arm, study participants were divided into tertiles by 
BMI. Bimekizumab trough concentrations were collected at baseline, Week 4 and Week 8. 
Data supporting self-injection 
The GeoMean trough concentrations at Week 4 and Week 8 (associated with self-injection at the previous 
visits using the bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1m device presentations) were similar to 
those at Baseline (associated with the last injection by study personnel in the feeder study using the 1mL 
PFS). Summary statistics and boxplots of trough bimekizumab concentrations by visit and by device 
presentation are presented below:

bimekizumab-SS-1mL group and the bimekizumab-AI-1mL group (PK-PPS-s and PK-PPS-a) 
Data supporting sites of injection 
Within both the bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1mL groups, the trough bimekizumab 
concentrations between injection sites tended to be similar and the ranges overlapped across all 3 visits, 
regardless of whether the previous dose had been self-administered or given by study personnel.

Data supporting use across different BMI tertiles 
In both the bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1mL groups, trough concentrations decreased as 
BMI increased with the lowest geometric mean trough bimekizumab plasma concentrations generally 
observed for study participants in the highest BMI tertile. Within each tertile, the trough bimekizumab 
concentrations were reasonably similar regardless of whether the previous dose was self-administered or 
administered by the study personnel. Summary statistics and boxplots of bimekizumab plasma 
concentration by BMI tertile after self-injection or injection by study personnel are presented for each

Pharmacokinetics in Target Population 
Phase 2 Studies 
Study AS0008 
AS0008 was a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-
ranging study to evaluate the efficacy, PK, PD, and safety of bimekizumab in adult study participants with 
active axSpA. The inclusion criteria were designed to ensure all study participants had moderate-to-
severe active axSpA. This study included 4 periods: a Screening Period (4 weeks), a Double-blind Period 
(12 weeks), a Dose-blind Period (36 weeks), and a Safety Follow-up (SFU) Visit (20 weeks after the last 
dose). 
During the Double-blind Period, a total of 303 study participants were randomised 1:1:1:1:1 (stratified by

receive bimekizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Q4W) at doses of 16mg (n=61), 64mg (n=61) 
160mg (n=60), or 320mg (n=61). Blood samples for bimekizumab plasma concentrations were taken at 
Baseline, and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
After the 12-week Double-blind Period, 296 study participants entered the 36-week Dose-blind Period. At 
the Week 12 Visit, study participants were allocated to bimekizumab treatment regimens as follows; 
Study participants in the placebo and bimekizumab 16mg or 64mg groups were re-randomised in a 1:1 
fashion to bimekizumab 160mg or bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and study participants in the bimekizumab 
160mg or bimekizumab 320mg groups continued to receive their respective treatments. Blood samples

Figure 7 shows a summary of bimekizumab plasma concentrations by visit and by treatment group for 
the PK-PPS. Trough samples collected from Week 4 onwards are not comparable to Weeks 1 and 2, which 
were post-dose samples. Geometric mean plasma bimekizumab concentrations increased in a dose 
proportional manner and the placebo group levels were BLQ for all samples up to Week 12. For the 
160mg and 320mg groups (who continued on the same dose after week 12), steady state was achieved 
between Week 16 and Week 20.

Study AS0009 
AS0009 is a multicenter Open-Label Extension (OLE) study to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of bimekizumab in eligible adult study participants with axSpA who completed the Phase 2b 
study AS0008. The OLE study assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab for a period 
of up to 208 weeks (~4 years). The data available for this assessment is based on an interim analysis 
after the final study participant had reached Week 108. 
At the time of completion of AS0008, participants were receiving 1 of 2 doses of bimekizumab; 160mg 
Q4W or 320mg Q4W. All participants in the AS0009 OLE study received bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, giving 
two groups Bimekizumab 160mg→160mg and Bimekizumab 320mg→160mg. A total of 255 participants 
started the study and 31 participants were discontinued on or before Week 108. Blood samples for 
bimekizumab plasma concentrations were taken at the Entry Visit (EV) (this was also the final visit of 
AS0008), and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96. 
The following restrictions were applied for the biological DMARDs: 
Table 11: prohibited or restricted medications 
A summary of the plasma concentrations of bimekizumab by visit is presented in Figure 9 below. Overall, 
the geometric mean plasma bimekizumab concentration remained relatively constant throughout AS0009 
for participants who had received Bimekizumab 160mg in the AS008 study, indicating steady state had 
been achieved. Participants who received Bimekizumab 320mg in AS0008 showed plasma concentrations 
of bimekizumab approximately 2 times higher than the 160mg group at the EV, which decreased to 
steady state levels by Week 24.

Study AS0013 
AS0013 was a multicenter, Phase 2a, randomised, study participant-blind, and investigator-blind, 
parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab compared to certolizumab pegol 
in adult study participants with active adult-onset axSpA. The study period included a Screening Period, a 
Treatment Period (Week 0 to Week 12) and a Treatment Extension Period (Week 12 to 48). 
Eligible study participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive 1 of 2 investigational medicinal 
products (IMP), either bimekizumab or certolizumab pegol. During the Treatment Period, study 
participants received Bimekizumab 160mg SC Q2W from Week 0 through Week 10 (in addition the 
participants received 1 placebo injection at Baseline (Visit 2), Week 2 (Visit 3), and Week 4 (Visit 4) in 
order to have maintained the blind for the certolizumab pegol), or Certolizumab pegol 400mg sc Q2W at 
Weeks 0, 2, and 4 (loading dose) followed by certolizumab pegol 200mg sc Q2W in Weeks 6 to 10. For 
the 36 Week Treatment Extension Period participants remained on the same IMP at a Q4W dosing 
schedule; bimekizumab 320mg sc every 4 weeks (Q4W) from Week 12 to Week 44 or certolizumab pegol 
400mg Q4W from Week 12 to Week 44. Blood samples for PK were collected at Baseline, Week 4, Week 
12, Week 24, Week 36, Week 48, and during the Safety Follow-up at Week 64. 
Patients may have received 1 prior TNF antagonist.

Phase 3 Studies 
Study AS0010 
AS0010 is a Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of bimekizumab compared with placebo in participants with active nonradiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis. The study period for this report includes up to a 5-week Screening period, through 
Week 24 of the treatment period, with placebo participants switching to bimekizumab at the end of Week 
16 of the treatment period. 
Eligible study participants were randomised 1:1 to receive 1 of 2 treatments (bimekizumab 160mg sc 
Q4W or placebo sc Q4W), and remain on allowable background medication, until Week 16. Thereafter, 
study participants randomised to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W remained on their randomised dose and 
study participants randomised to placebo were reallocated to receive bimekizumab 160mg Q4W after all 
Week 16 assessments had been completed. Blood samples for bimekizumab plasma concentrations were 
taken at Baseline, and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 for the study period in this report. 
Patients may have received 1 prior TNF antagonist. 
The applicant has planned to further collect PK samples at weeks 36, 52 and at the end of SFU period. 
The following restrictions were applied for the biological DMARDs:

This study includes the following 3 periods: a Screening Period, a Treatment Period (52 weeks) consisting 
of a 16-week Double-Blind Treatment and subsequent Maintenance period. Eligible study participants 
were randomised 2:1 to receive 1 of 2 treatments (bimekizumab 160mg sc Q4W or placebo sc Q4W) and 
remain on their allowable background medication. At the end of the 16-week Double-Blind Treatment 
Period, study participants receiving placebo were re-allocated to bimekizumab treatment at Week 16 after 
all assessments had been completed. Blood samples for bimekizumab plasma concentrations were taken 
at Baseline, and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. 
Patients may have received 1 prior TNF antagonist. 
The MAH has planned to further collect PK samples at weeks 36, 52 and at the end of SFU period. 
A summary of bimekizumab plasma concentrations for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and placebo 
by visit is presented in Figure 12. There was a 1.72-fold increase in geometric mean trough bimekizumab 
concentration between Week 4 and Week 16 when steady state was reached in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W group. In the placebo/bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, once study participants switched to

Population PK modelling 
The data for the present analysis originated from fifteen different Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies: PS0010, 
PS0011, PS0016, PS0008, PS0009, PS0013, PS0015, PA0008, PA0010, PA0011, PA0012, AS0008, 
AS0013, AS0010 and AS0011. In these studies, patients with PSO, PsA or axSpA had subcutaneous (SC) 
administrations of bimekizumab with various dosing regimens. Studies PS0015, PA0010, PA0011, 
PA0012, AS0010 and AS0011 were still ongoing at the time of the analysis and consequently interim data 
was used for these studies. The population PK analysis included all data available at Week 24 cut-off for 
studies PA0010, AS0010, and AS0011, and all data available at Week 16 cut-off for study PA0011, as well 
as the available data from study PA0012 at the time of the PA0011 data cut. For study PS0015, data up 
to week 48 (end of second treatment period) was included. 
The population PK analyses were performed in the non-linear mixed effect modeling software NONMEM 
version 7.4 or higher using the first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI) 
estimation. Covariate-parameter relationships were assessed using the stepwise covariate model building 
procedure (SCM) with adaptive scope reduction (ASR). The evaluated covariates were: body weight (WT), 
age, sex, race/region, disease indication, disease duration, methotrexate (MTX) use at Baseline, 
corticosteroids use at Baseline, conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD) 
use at Baseline, prior anti-TNF therapy, prior use of biologics, ADAb and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) 
status, anti-drug-antibodies (ADAb) titer, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) at Baseline, and 
liver function at Baseline. 
The dataset included 33,996 bimekizumab PK observations with multiple SC administrations across doses 
ranging from 16mg to 480mg and a total of 4010 patients (1809 with moderate to severe PSO, 1274 with 
PsA, and 927 with axSpA). The following observations were excluded: 1331 (3.8%) below LLOQ, 5 above 
LLOQ before the first active dose, 16 observations with duplicated records, and 1 observation associated 
with a double dose. 
Study participant characteristics for the PK analysis data set were presented by disease indication for: 
baseline continuous covariates (Table 16), baseline categorical covariates (Table 17), and combined ADAb 
and neutralising antibodies (NAb) status (Table 18).

The starting point of model development was based on the previous popPK model for bimekizumab in 
patients with PSO: a one-compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination, 
including a covariate effect of WT on CL/F and V/F. A parameter for Frel was included, with a typical value 
fixed to 1. A two-compartment model was explored but did not provide a better fit of the PK data. Thus, 
the two-compartment model was not retained. 
The covariate testing identified the following statistically significant covariate-parameter relationships: 
WT, ADAb/NAb status, ADAb titer, hs-CRP, prior use of biologics, age, race, sex and total bilirubin on 
CL/F, WT on V/F, as well as age and disease indication on Frel. 
The final popPK model was a one compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. IIV 
terms were supported on CL/F, V/F and Frel. The RUV for bimekizumab was described by a proportional 
model and was associated with an exponential IIV term. Covariate effects included in the final model 
were WT on CL/F and V/F and race on CL/F. In the final model, the estimated exponent of WT effect on 
CL/F and V/F was 0.996 and 0.733, respectively. The impacts of other significant covariates identified in 
the covariate testing on PK parameters and steady-state exposures were small and not retained in the 
final model. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in CL/F or V/F between patients 
with PSO, PsA or axSpA and no evidence of statistically significant effects for concomitant use of MTX, 
csDMARDs or corticosteroids at Baseline on CL/F. 
The parameter estimates of the final bimekizumab population PK model, compared to the base model, are 
presented in Table 19. GOF plots are presented in Figure 13 (observed versus predicted concentrations) 
and Figure 14 (CWRES versus predicted concentrations and time). The GOF plots do not show any 
unacceptable trends overall. Figure 15 and Figure 16 present pcVPC plots for bimekizumab, stratified by 
phase of development and study, respectively. The figures show that the final bimekizumab model 
provides a good description of both the general trend and the variability in all studies.

Immunogenicity 
Phase 1 
Study UP0067 
UP0067 was a Phase 1, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled single dose study to evaluate the 
PK, safety, and tolerability of bimekizumab in healthy Chinese volunteers. Blood samples were taken for 
anti-bimekizumab antibodies at Day 1 (Predose), and Days 14, 28, 56, 84, 112, and at the Day 140 
Safety follow-up. 
Anti-bimekizumab antibody status by visit is summarised in Table 21. Overall, the incidence of ADAb 
positivity was similar between the bimekizumab 160mg group (71.4%) and the bimekizumab 320mg 
group (81.18%). Five study participants (27.8%) had ADAb-positive results on Day 1 (predose). All 
ADAb-positive study participants had titers at the LLOQ or a level not significantly higher than LLOQ 
(0.25μg/mL), with the exception of one study participant at Day 84 who received bimekizumab 320mg. 
There was no impact of ADAb status on the PK of bimekizumab after a single dose (160mg or 320mg).

Phase 2 
Study AS0008 
AS0008 was a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-
ranging study to evaluate the efficacy, PK, PD, and safety of bimekizumab in adult study participants with 
active Ankylosing Spondyloarthritis (AS). Blood samples for ADAb detection were taken at Baseline, and 
at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and Week 48. 
A summary of ADAb status by visit for the Pharmacodynamic Per-Protocol Set (PD-PPS) is presented in 
Table 22. Overall, the percentage of study participants who were ADAb positive at any point up to Week

AS0009 
AS0009 is a multicenter Open-Label Extension (OLE) study to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of bimekizumab in eligible adult study participants with ankylosing spondylitis who completed 
the Phase 2b study AS0008. The data available for this assessment is based on an interim analysis after 
the final study participant had reached Week 108. Blood samples for anti-bimekizumab antibodies were 
taken at the Entry Visit, and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and Week 96.

A summary of ADAb status in AS0009 is presented for the Safety Set (SS) in Table 23. In AS0009 (~2 
years of treatment), the incidence of ADAb positivity was 11.6% and 17.5% for participants who received 
bimekizumab 160 mg and 320 mg Q4W in the AS0008 study, respectively. For the study participants who 
received bimekizumab 160 mg and 320 mg Q4W in the AS0008 and subsequently continued treatment in 
AS0009, the incidence of ADAb positivity was 24% and 33% respectively. The ADAb positivity did not 
appear to have an effect on bimekizumab concentrations or an impact on efficacy.

in adult study participants with active adult-onset axSpA. Blood samples for bimekizumab antibody 
detection were taken at Baseline, and Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and Week 48.  
At Baseline, the prevalence of ADAb positivity was ~4% in the bimekizumab group. Over time, the 
cumulative number of study participants with treatment-induced anti-bimekizumab antibodies (23.5%) 
reached a maximum by Week 36. These results align with previous studies of the bimekizumab Q4W 
treatment regimen.  
Phase 3 
Study AS0010 
AS0010 is a Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of bimekizumab compared with placebo in participants with active nonradiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis. The study period for the interim study report includes up to a 5-week Screening, 
through Week 24 of the treatment period, with placebo participants switching to bimekizumab at the end 
of Week 16 of the treatment period. Blood samples for anti-bimekizumab antibody detection were taken 
at Baseline, and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 for the study period in the report. 
A summary of ADAb status up to Week 16 and up to Week 24 and the number and percentage of study 
participants in each ADAb subcategory up to Week 24 is presented for the Immunogenicity SS in Table 
24. Exportation of all samples from China was not possible. Therefore, the Immunogenicity SS used for 
ADAb and NAb analyses in this Week 24 report only includes available samples from non-Chinese study 
participants. 
By Week 16 and Week 24, 42.0% and 51.3%, respectively, of study participants in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group were ADAb positive, with low (4.2%) Baseline ADAb positivity rates and most of the 
ADAb positivity developed after bimekizumab treatment initiation (47.9% of study participants had a total 
treatment-emergent ADAb positive result in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group by Week 24). The ADAb 
titers were generally low, close to the lower limit of assay detection with no apparent trend of increased 
titers over study visits in the 24-week treatment period. The incidence of boosted ADAb titers was low 
after treatment up to 24 weeks (0.8%) in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. The plasma 
concentrations of bimekizumab 160mg Q4W were similar in ADAb positive and ADAb negative study 
participants up to Week 24.

AS0011 
AS0011 is an ongoing multicenter, Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in study participants with active ankylosing spondylitis 
with radiographic sacroiliitis (r-axSpA). Blood samples for anti-bimekizumab antibodies were taken at 
Baseline, and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 for this study period. 
A summary of ADAb status up to Week 16 and up to Week 24 and the number and percentage of study 
participants for each ADAb subcategory up to Week 24 is presented for the Immunogenicity SS in Table 
25. By Week 16 and Week 24, 31.4% and 37.1% respectively, of study participants in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group were ADAb positive, with low (5.2%) baseline ADAb positivity rates and most ADAb 
positivity developed after bimekizumab treatment initiation (33.0% of study participants had a total 
treatment-emergent ADAb positive result in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group by Week 24). The ADAb 
titers were generally low, close to the lower limit of assay detection with no apparent trend of increased 
EMA/235041/2023

titers over study visits in the 24-week treatment period. The incidence of boosted ADAb titers was low 
(1.0% of study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group by Week 24).

Population PK and PK/PD modelling 
In the integrated popPK analysis, patients who were ADAb+/NAb+ were predicted to have 7% (95% CI 
5%–10%) faster CL/F than ADAb- patients. Therefore, steady-state AUC and Ctrough exposures were 
predicted to be 7% and 9% lower, respectively, in ADAb+/NAb+ patients, compared to ADAb- patients. 
Patients who were ADAb+/NAb- were predicted to have similar CL/F to those who were ADAb-. Patients 
with ADAb titer value of 788 (95th percentile of strictly positive ADAb titer values) were predicted to have 
9% (95% CI 9%–10%) faster CL/F compared to ADAb- patients. 
Simulations based on the final popPK/PD model indicated that ADAb positivity was not associated with a 
clinically meaningful impact on efficacy as assessed by ASAS responses at Week 16.

Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No specific studies have been conducted in study participants to determine the effect of renal or hepatic 
impairment on the PK of bimekizumab. The renal elimination of intact bimekizumab, an IgG mAb, is 
expected to be low and of minor importance. Further, as a mAb, bimekizumab is not expected to be 
metabolized in the liver. Thus, no dose adjustment is proposed, by the MAH, in these patient populations. 
Age 
In the integrated popPK analysis (age range of 18.0◦years to 85.0◦years), compared to the reference 
value of 45 years old, patients aged 24 years old (5th percentile) were predicted to have 4% (95% CI 
3%-5%) faster CL/F and 7% (95% CI 5%–9%) higher Frel, while patients aged 68 years old (95th 
percentile) were predicted to have 4% (95% CI 3%–6%) slower CL/F and 7% (95% CI 5%–8%) lower 
Frel. Thus, the PK parameters were similar in the different age subgroups. A table with predicted 
bimekizumab exposures stratified by different age categories (< 65 years and ≥65 years and < 75 years 
and ≥75 years) is presented in Table 26. 
Table 26: Simulated AUCSS, Cmax,SS, Ctrough,SS, Tmax,SS, AR and t1/2 stratified by different 
age categories assuming a 160 mg Q4W dosing regimen 
In the PK/PD model of ASAS response, age was a statistically significant covariate on Emax; ASAS 
response increased with decreasing age. Following bimekizumab 160mg Q4W dosing, in participants at 
the 5th and 95th age percentile (23 years and 61 years, respectively), the median predicted ASAS40 
response rate was 70.3% and 34.3%, respectively (Figure 19). In study participants at the higher end of 
the age range, a bimekizumab dose of 320mg Q4W was predicted to result in a similar median ASAS 
response compared to a 160mg Q4W dose. Thus, no dose adjustment for age is warranted according to 
the MAH.

The evaluated age values were the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles, corresponding 
to 23, 32, 40, 49 and 61 years, respectively. The points and the vertical error bars represent 
the median and 95% PI of the mean response rates for each concentration. The plot is based 
on 591 bootstrap samples of 591 simulated study participants for each dose and age percentile 
Gender 
Based on the integrated popPK modelling, there was no evidence of a clinically relevant change in 
bimekizumab CL/F between males and females. Women were predicted to have 10% (95% CI 8%-12%) 
faster CL/F than men. Therefore, steady-state AUC and Ctrough exposures were predicted to be 9% and 
13% lower, respectively, in women, compared to men. In the PK/PD analysis, sex was not identified as a 
covariate on ASAS response. As such, no dose adjustment for sex is required according to the MAH. 
Race 
The similarity in PK between Japanese and Caucasian healthy study participants was demonstrated in the 
clinical study UP0042, which was presented in original PSO application. These results were also confirmed 
in the previous popPK model in patients with moderate to severe PSO and further supported by consistent 
findings from the popPK modelling across indications.  
In the integrated popPK model, Japanese patients were predicted to have 23% higher CL/F, and Chinese 
and other Asian patients were predicted to have 13% higher CL/F, compared to the reference Caucasian 
population. However, the effect of race on CL/F was less pronounced than the effect of WT. The median 
WTs in Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian patients were 69, 76 and 85 kg, respectively. Therefore, the 
smaller WTs in Japanese and Chinese patients offset the increase in CL/F and resulted in overall 
comparable PK exposure across the race subpopulations. The simulated AUCss, Cmax,ss and Ctrough,ss

for the 160 mg Q4W dose over 8 weeks are summarized for the reference race group (Caucasian, Black, 
American Indian or Alaska Native, Hawaiian or other Pacific islander, missing and others, referred to as 
Caucasian), Chinese and other Asian (referred to as Chinese), and Japanese participants in Table 27.

race, assuming a 160 mg Q4W dosing regimen 
Simulations based on the final popPK/PD model were performed to assess the impact of race on the ASAS 
response rates at Week 16. Figure 20 shows the predicted ASAS response rates at Week 16 versus WT 
percentiles in each race subgroup. There was no difference in response across races. Thus, based on the 
overall data, no dose adjustment for race or ethnicity is required, according to the MAH.

of the mean response rates for each WT. The plot is based on 591 bootstrap samples of 591 
simulated study participants for each dose, race and weight percentile. The Caucasian race 
group includes Caucasian, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other 
Pacific Islander, Other and missing. The Chinese race group includes Chinese and Other Asian 
Bodyweight 
In the integrated popPK model, WT had the largest impact on CL/F and impacted V/F to a lesser extent. 
Compared to the reference WT of 84 kg, the steady-state AUC was predicted to be approximately 30% 
lower for a subject weighing 122 kg and 50% higher for a subject weighing 57 kg. According to the MAH, 
the predicted magnitude of drop in exposure for a patient weighing 122 kg is less likely to be seen in 
patients with axSpA (or PsA) compared to patients with PSO, since more than 95% of patients with 
axSpA and PsA in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies weighed less than 122 kg (the median WT for study 
participants with PSO, PsA and axSpA were 87.2, 84 and 79 kg, respectively). The simulated AUCss,

Cmax,ss, Ctrough,ss, Tmax, t1/2 and accumulation ratio (AR), stratified by weight categories of < 120 kg 
and ≥120 kg, are presented in Table 28.  
Table 28: Median and 2.5th-97.5th AUCSS, Cmax,SS and Ctrough,SS over 8 weeks, stratified by 
dosing regimen and body weight category 
Simulations based on the final popPK/PD model were performed to assess the impact of bodyweight on 
the ASAS response rates at Week 16. Figure 21 shows that the ASAS response rates at Week 16 slightly 
decreased with increasing WT, due to decreased exposure to bimekizumab, but the differences in the 
response rates were relatively small across the WT percentiles. The ASAS40 median response rate ranged 
from 46% at the 95th WT percentile (111 kg) to 50% at the 5th WT percentile (54 kg), for the 160 mg 
Q4W dose, and ranged from 50% at the 95th WT percentile to 53% at the 5th WT percentile, for the 320 
mg Q4W dose. However, the 95% PIs for the 160 mg and 320 mg dose groups overlapped at each WT 
percentile. Additionally, bimekizumab exposure following 160mg Q4W at the higher end of the exposure 
range in study participants did not appear to be associated with increased incidences of overall TEAEs and 
infection TEAEs. Thus, no dose adjustment based on weight is warranted.

and 95% PI of the mean response rates for each WT. The plot is based on 591 bootstrap 
samples of 591 simulated study participants for each dose and weight percentile 
Drug interactions 
No DDI studies have been conducted with bimekizumab.  
PopPK modelling found no evidence of a statistically significant impact of use of medications 
concomitantly administered with bimekizumab in rheumatologic indications (MTX, corticosteroids, or 
cDMARDs) on bimekizumab CL/F. In addition, there was no evidence of a statistically significant impact 
for use of these concomitant medications on either probability of ASAS response or Emax in the popPK/PD 
analysis. 
In the original PSO application, results of UP0034 showed that bimekizumab did not have an impact on 
the production of antibody titers to the influenza vaccine.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Bimekizumab is a humanised, full-length immunoglobulin G1 anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody that 
selectively binds with high affinity to IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines, blocking their interaction with 
the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex. 
Primary pharmacology 
None of the cytokines or chemokines measured showed clinically relevant changes during the Double-
blind period of study AS0008. At baseline, all but two participants had IL-17A concentrations below limit 
of quantification and so no formal statistical analysis was performed. Interleukin-17F was not measured 
in this study as per protocol, due to technical challenges in developing this assay. From the flow 
cytometry analysis for the Double-blind Period, there was an increase in CD4 T helper cells that was both 
dose- and time-dependent. None of the other immune cell subsets showed relevant changes either with 
dose or duration of treatment during the Double-blind Period. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Bimekizumab is a mAb and is not expected to interact with the hERG channel. A thorough QT/QTc clinical 
study has therefore not been conducted by the MAH. As described in the original PSO application, there 
were no cardiovascular findings that could be attributed to treatment with bimekizumab during nonclinical 
evaluation in the Cynomolgus monkey (8-week study NCD2260 and the 26-week study NCD2450). 
Additionally, no notable trends in abnormal ECG findings were observed in the axSpA clinical studies, and 
the incidence of major adverse cardiac events was low. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Population PK/PD modelling of ASAS response from Phase 2 study (AS0008) 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 59/230 
 
 
 
 
 
A population PK model in study participants with active axSpA was developed using data from the Phase 
2b study, AS0008. Data from the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period and data up to the date of the 
data cut from the 36-week Dose-Blind Period were included in the analysis. The final popPK model was a 
one compartment model with linear absorption and elimination. Body weight on CL/F and V/F was the 
only statistically significant covariate included in the model.  
Using data from the 12-week placebo-controlled period in AS0008, a population PK/PD model was then 
developed to establish the dose-exposure-response relationship between bimekizumab and ASAS 
response over time. This analysis supported dose regimen selection for the pivotal Phase 3 studies in the 
axSpA program. 
The final popPK/PD model was based on 1,799 ASAS observations from 303 study participants. It was a 
proportional odds model fitted to the placebo dose group and the active treatment arms in the 12-week 
Double-Blind Treatment Period of study AS0008. The model provided a good description of the data it 
was developed on and could also predict the Dose-Blind Treatment Period of study AS0008 (which 
followed the initial 12 weeks) reasonably well. None of the tested covariates resulted in a significant 
improvement of the model fit; these included age, disease duration, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, 
weekly dose of methotrexate (MTX), body weight, Baseline ASDAS, ADAb, sex, csDMARD other than MTX 
as past medication, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug at Baseline, previous anti-TNF use, prior biologic 
therapy). 
The observed and model predicted fractions of ASAS20 and ASAS40 responder categories at Week 12 
versus bimekizumab dose group for the final ASAS model are presented in Figure 22. These plots 
demonstrate that the final ASAS model provides a good description of the dose-response relationship at 
Week 12. Moreover, the fractions of ASAS responders increased when the dose was increased from 16 to 
160mg, but increasing the dose to 320mg did not result in a clear improvement in the ASAS response.

Population PK-PD modelling of ASAS response following bimekizumab subcutaneous 
administration in patients with axial spondyloarthritis 
The aim of this analysis was to characterise the exposure-response relationship between bimekizumab 
plasma concentrations and the efficacy endpoint, assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 
(ASAS) response, in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), using a population PK-PD modelling 
approach. The response was categorised as followed: non-response, 20% improvement in ASAS response 
(ASAS20), and 40% improvement in ASAS response (ASAS40). 
The data originated from one Phase 2 study (AS0008) and two ongoing Phase 3 studies (AS0010, 
AS0011). The impact of the exploratory covariates was investigated using the SCM procedure with 
adaptive scope reduction. Covariates evaluated are presented in Table 29. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 61/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 29: Covariates tested in the PK-PD model 
In total, 5816 ASAS response observations from 887 patients with axSpA were included in the analysis.  
The final ASAS model was a proportional odds model. The probability of being an ASAS20 or an ASAS40 
responder was a function of the baseline probability, the treatment effect, and IIV. All study participants 
were, per definition, non-responders at baseline and the probability of not being a non-responder at 
baseline was fixed to an extremely low value, and consequently this parameter had no impact on the 
probability of response. The treatment effect included a placebo response model, and an active drug 
response model. The placebo response increased with increasing time (log-linear relationship). The active 
drug model was constituted of an Emax function of the individual predicted bimekizumab plasma 
concentration, and an exponential function of time. IIV terms were supported on the probability of 
response and on Emax. The final model included the effect of age and baseline hs-CRP on Emax. The 
ASAS response rates decreased with increasing age and increased with increasing baseline hs-CRP. The 
parameter estimates of the final model, compared to the base model, are presented in Table 30.

VPC plots for the final ASAS model are presented in Figure 23 and Figure 24.  
In Figure 23, ASAS20-40 responders correspond to the study participants who were ASAS20 responders 
but not ASAS40 responders. These figures demonstrate that the final ASAS model provides a good 
description of the data. The proportion of non-responders in the 320 mg dose group appears to be slightly 
overestimated while the proportion of ASAS40 responders is slightly underestimated. However, the 
majority of the data were in the placebo and 160 mg Q4W group (approximately 300 and 400 study 
participants, respectively), while the 16, 64 and 320 mg Q4W groups only included approximately 60 
study participants each.

represent the median and the 95% CI of the model predictions (based on 200 simulations); 
the red points represent the observed proportion of study participants in the analysis data set, 
and the red line is the observed median 
Figure 24 shows the observed and model predicted transitions between the different ASAS responder 
categories (non-responder, ASAS20-40 responder and ASAS40 responder). For each patient in the 
analysis data set, each ASAS response observation was compared to the previous one. If the observation 
was the same as the previous one, it was classified as no transition; if the observation was in a higher 
response category compared to the previous one, it was classified as positive transition; if the 
observation was in a lower response category compared to the previous one, it was classified as negative 
transition. These figures show that the final ASAS response model describes the transitions between 
these categories reasonably well.

Simulations were performed to assess the impact of change in bimekizumab CL/F on the predicted ASAS 
response rates. The results are presented in Figure 25. The median ASAS response rates at Week 16 
were slightly increased when exposure increased (lower CL/F), and slightly decreased when exposure 
decreased (higher CL/F). The ASAS20 response rate ranged from 69% to 74%, compared to 72% for a 
typical CL/F. The ASAS40 response rate ranged from 44% to 52%, compared to 49% for a typical CL/F.

The simulated ASAS response rates for different dose levels at Week 16 and from baseline to Week 16 
are presented in Figure 26 and Figure 27, respectively. The predicted median ASAS40 response rate at 
Week 16 increased with increasing dose, it was 16%, 27%, 41%, 48%, and 51% for placebo, 16 mg 
Q4W, 64 mg Q4W, 160 mg Q4W and 320 mg Q4W dosing regimens, respectively. Based on the 95% PI, 
the ASAS40 response rate at Week 16 for the 160 mg Q4W dose ranged from 45% to 51%, and was 
similar to the ASAS40 response rate for the 320 mg Q4W dose (ranged from 48% to 54%).

[8.3–41.0] μg/mL, respectively. The median predicted ASAS40 response rate at the median [5th to 95th

In study participants with higher age or lower baseline hs-CRP levels, who were predicted to have lower 
ASAS response rates compared to a typical study participant, an increase in dose from 160 mg Q4W to 
320 mg Q4W was expected to result in similar median ASAS response rate predictions, with overlapping 
prediction intervals: 
- In study participants 61 years of age (95th percentile), the predicted median ASAS40 response was 
34.3% (2.5th–97.5th percentile range, 31.5%–37.0%) for the 160 mg Q4W dose and 36.1% (2.5th–
97.5th percentile range, 33.2%–38.9%) for the 320 mg Q4W dose, respectively. 
- In study participants with baseline hs-CRP levels of 1 mg/L (5th percentile), the predicted median 
ASAS40 response was 37.8% (2.5th–97.5th percentile range, 35.1%–40.8%) for the 160 mg Q4W dose 
and 40.0% (2.5th–97.5th percentile range, 37.2%–43.0%) for the 320 mg Q4W dose, respectively.

Exposure-safety analysis of bimekizumab 
The exposure-response relationships for safety include data from the Phase 3 studies, AS0010 and 
AS0011. These studies represent the majority of study participants who were treated with bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W continuous dosing. 
Infections were used in the exposure-response analysis since the incidence was high enough to result in a 
meaningful number of cases for comparison between the different plasma concentration quartiles. In 
addition, given the mechanism of action of bimekizumab, it is mechanistically considered possible to have 
an exposure-response relationship for infections. 
Plasma bimekizumab trough concentrations were not associated with clinically-relevant increases in 
incidences of TEAEs or infection TEAEs. The incidences of TEAEs in the first, second, third, and fourth 
concentration quartiles for Pool SA2 were 81.0%, 83.8%, 73.8%, and 75.0%, respectively, and the 
incidences of infection TEAEs were 55.7%, 61.3%, 40.0%, and 48.7%, respectively (Table 31). Likewise, 
no clear pattern was observed for the incidences of TEAEs in the first, second, third, and fourth 
concentration quartiles for the high-level group term of fungal infectious disorders (12.7%, 22.5%, 
12.5%, and 9.2%, respectively) or the high-level term of Candida infection (7.6%, 11.3%, 7.5%, and 
5.3%, respectively). Thus, no clear trend was observed between bimekizumab exposure following 160mg 
Q4W in study participants with axSpA and the incidences of overall TEAEs, infection TEAEs, fungal 
infectious disorder TEAEs, or Candida infection TEAEs. 
None of the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT (defined as ≥5% of study participants in any plasma 
concentration quartile) showed a meaningful increase in incidence with increasing bimekizumab trough 
plasma concentration quartile (Table 31).

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
The PK method used a standard ligand binding approach based on the meso scale discovery (MSD) 
platform. Four PK assays were used, three of which were previously assessed in the initial MAA for 
psoriasis and therefore are considered to be appropriately validated. Method performance data from the 
clinical studies were provided by the MAH, and in general showed that the methods performed as 
expected.  
The ADA method used a standard ligand binding MSD platform approach where samples and positive and 
negative controls were incubated with Biotin-UCB4940, Sulfo-Tag-UCB4940, anti-human IL-17A, and 
rabbit anti-human IL-17F. Any ADA present in the human plasma will form a bridge between the Biotin-
UCB4940 and Sulfo-Tag-UCB4940 molecules, with the anti-human IL-17A and anti-human IL-17F. Five 
versions of the ADA assay were used throughout development, all of which were previously assessed in 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 71/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the original MAA for the psoriasis indication. Bioanalytical reports from all relevant clinical studies have 
been provided and show that the assay passed routine control testing and performed as expected.  
Competitive ligand binding assay methods were used to detect neutralising antibodies. The methods were 
assessed as part of the initial MAA submission for the PSO indication. Bioanalytical study reports were 
provided for each study and showed acceptable assay performance.  
Additional validation data were submitted due to questionable performance of the NAb assays during 
sample analysis from plaque psoriasis patients and showed acceptable assay performance. Assay 
performance in patients with PsA and axSpA was appropriately described.  
Bioavailability 
Study UP0067 
The study design and methodology of the Phase 1 study, UP0067, in healthy, Chinese subjects were 
appropriate. The rationale for and exclusion of participants from the PK analyses were acceptable. The 
results indicated dose-proportional PK of bimekizumab between the dose range studied (160mg to 
320mg), which is consistent with other PK studies of bimekizumab in different populations. Apparent 
clearance (CL/F) was independent of dose. Similar half-life and apparent clearance (CL/F) to the other 
populations were observed. 
Device use study (DV0004) 
The design and methodology of the device use study (DV0004) are acceptable. Exclusion of participants 
from each study arm was adequately detailed and per protocol. Self-injection was investigated into the 
thigh or abdomen. The MAH has considered that self-administration into the upper arm is not convenient 
(especially for patients with limited hand dexterity) and was thus not evaluated in DV0004. This is 
acknowledged. 
Overall, the results of the device presentation substudy demonstrated that there were no clinically 
meaningful differences observed in bimekizumab plasma trough concentrations between investigational 
device presentations (bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1mL), and injection by study personnel 
or self-injection.  
Although the participant numbers were lower in study participants who chose to self-inject in the thigh 
compared with the abdomen, the bimekizumab trough concentrations were similar.  
As expected, plasma trough concentrations were inversely related to BMI. This is in-line with the 
population PK analyses where body weight was a significant covariate on CL/F and V/F, explaining the 
decrease in plasma concentration with an increase in weight. See below Special Populations section for 
further discussion of the impact of body weight on bimekizumab exposure. Within each BMI tertile, 
plasma concentrations were generally similar irrespective of whether the previous dose had been 
administered by the study participant or study personnel.  
It is agreed that symptoms associated with PsA, compared to axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), are more 
likely to negatively impact dexterity and coordination of the patient’s hands and arms. Therefore, it is 
reasonable to expect that patients with axSpA will be able to self-inject safely and effectively if patients 
with PsA are able to do so. Therefore, by extrapolation, the results of DV0004 also support safe and 
effective self-administration using these device presentations in patients with axSpA. 
Of note, in the pivotal Phase 3 studies (AS0010 and AS0011), dose administration in the lateral 
abdominal wall, upper arm and upper outer thigh by study staff was permitted. It was recommended to 
rotate between different injection sites during the study.

PK in the target population 
Phase 2  
The results of study AS0008 indicated dose-proportional PK of bimekizumab between the dose ranges 
studied (16mg, 64mg, 160mg and 320mg), which is consistent with other PK studies of bimekizumab in 
different populations. The results indicated steady state was reached between weeks 16-20, which is 
consistent with the bimekizumab half-life of 23 days. 
Participants who remained on bimekizumab 160mg between studies AS0008 and AS0009 achieved and 
maintained steady state throughout the study. As expected, participants who moved from bimekizumab 
320mg in study AS0008 to 160mg in study AS0009 had nearly 2-fold concentrations of bimekizumab at 
the entry visit and the concentration lowered and achieved steady state by Week 24. This is in line with 
other studies that showed bimekizumab concentrations normally reach steady state after approximately 
16 weeks. 
In study AS0013, the bimekizumab 160mg Q2W dosing regimen was selected as it was expected to 
provide similar overall exposure to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W due to bimekizumab PK being linear in this 
range. The Treatment Period (Week 0 to Week 12) was not considered sufficiently long to show steady 
state levels for bimekizumab 160mg Q2W. Nevertheless, given that this was an exploratory Phase IIa 
study to assess efficacy, the issue was not further pursued by CHMP. 
Phase 3 
The pharmacokinetic results from the Phase 3 studies were in line with other studies in this application, 
with steady state being reached at Week 16 in the bimekizumab 160mg groups. This has been adequately 
reflected in SmPC section 5.2. 
Bimekizumab plasma concentrations observed in Japanese study participants were generally comparable 
with those observed in the overall study population following bimekizumab 160 mg Q4W in both studies. 
Due to the small number of Japanese study participants, conclusions are nevertheless limited. 
Overall, final PK data from the phase 2 axSpA studies (AS0008 and AS0013) were provided and 
summarised with descriptive statistics. Summarised PK data up to Week 108 for the phase 2 study 
AS0009 and up to Week 24 for the phase 3 studies AS0010 and AS0011 were also provided by the MAH 
in this submission. The MAH committed to submit the final AS009 CSR in Q2 2023.  
Population PK modelling 
In the integrated popPK analysis, the methods used for model development and evaluation are 
considered acceptable. Data exclusions were well detailed and acceptable. 
The starting model for this analysis was based on the previous popPK model for bimekizumab in patients 
with PSO. The key findings from this popPK analysis in patients with PSO, PsA, or axSpA were consistent 
with those made from the previous popPK analysis of PSO data only. 
The final model, a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, adequately 
described the data. The choice of a one-compartment rather than a two-compartment structural model 
was adequately justified by the MAH. Among the tested covariates, only bodyweight on CL/F and V/F and 
race on CL/F were retained in the final model. Bodyweight had the largest impact on CL/F and impacted 
V/F to a lesser extent, with higher body weight being associated with reduced bimekizumab exposure. 
Japanese patients were predicted to have 23% higher CL/F, and Chinese and other Asian patients were 
predicted to have 13% higher CL/F, compared to the reference Caucasian population. See Special 
populations for further details. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 73/230 
 
 
 
 
 
All PK parameters (fixed and random effects) in the final model were estimated with good precision 
(RSE<22.5%). The IIV terms were associated with reasonable shrinkage values: 22%, 34% and 15% for 
CL/F, V/F and Frel, respectively. The GOF plots showed that the model described the observed data well. 
The pcVPCs showed that the model captured the global trend and the variability of the concentration vs 
time data reasonably well. Overall, the final model is deemed adequate for deriving individual PK 
parameters (EBEs) and PK exposure metrics to be used in the subsequent PK/PD modelling analyses. 
Immunogenicity 
In the clinical phase 3 studies, treatment-emergent ADAb occurred as early as 4 weeks post first dose at 
the earliest sampling time point, and cumulative counts increased over time. The overall incidence of 
treatment-emergent ADAb was 31.3% following 16 weeks of treatment and 43.8% following 1 year of 
treatment with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W in the pooled Phase 3 axSpA studies based on the available 
data at the clinical data cut-off. The ADA positivity following 52 weeks of treatment was 57.1% (68/119) 
in nr-axSpA subjects and 44.3% (86/194) in AS subjects. The percentage of NAb-positive study 
participants in the bimekizumab following 52 weeks of treatment was 25.2% (30/119) in nr-axSpA 
subjects and 19.6% (38/194) in AS subjects. When pooled data are considered, 49.2% (154/313) of 
study participants had at least 1 ADAb-positive sample following 52 weeks of treatment.  
The overall incidence of Nab-positive study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group was 
11.8% by Week 16 and 21.4% by Week 52 in all available study participants in the pooled Phase 3 axSpA 
studies.  
Bimekizumab plasma concentrations were not impacted in the presence of ADAb or Nab at Week 16, but 
tended to be slightly lower in Nab-positive participants compared with ADAb-negative participants after 
Week 16.   
The overall incidence of NAb-positive study participants in the bimekizumab following 52 weeks of 
treatment was 21.7% (68/313). 
Key efficacy endpoints (ASAS40 and ASAS20) by ADAb and Nab status at Week 16 showed slightly lower 
response rates in ADAb-positive participants and lower response rates in Nab-positive participants or 
participants with high ADAb titers, compared with ADAb-negative participants. However, the number of 
Nab-positive study participants and study participants in each titer grouping was low, thus limiting 
interpretation.  
ADAb status, ADAb titers, and Nab status were not identified as clinically relevant covariates in the 
population PK analysis. Further, ADAb and Nab status were not identified as statistically significant 
covariates in the popPK/PD (ASAS) analysis. In addition, ADAb or Nab positivity had no clinically 
meaningful impact on the safety profile of bimekizumab regarding serious immune-based adverse 
reactions and injection site reactions, an increase in hypersensitivity TEAEs with ADAb positivity was 
noted. See Clinical Safety section on ADAb. 
Overall, based on all the available data, the presence of ADAb had no clinically meaningful impact on 
efficacy (as assessed by ASAS response at Week 16) in axSpA clinical studies. However, participants who 
were Nab-positive had a reduced response compared to those who were ADAb-negative. ADAb and Nab 
had no clinically meaningful impact on the safety profile of bimekizumab in axSpA regarding serious 
immune-based adverse reactions and injection site reactions, though, an increase in hypersensitivity 
TEAEs with ADAb positivity was noted. 
As requested, the MAH did provide individual study and pooled data up to week 52 for further analysis of 
immunogenicity data. In the pooled analysis, bimekizumab plasma concentrations were similar in ADAb-
positive and ADAb-negative participants while bimekizumab plasma concentrations tended to be slightly 
lower in NAb-positive compared with ADAb-negative participants based on overall NAb status at Week 52. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 74/230 
 
 
 
 
 
Data on ADA and Nab status up to week 52 from each individual studies AS0010 and AS0011 were 
adequately reflected in the SmPC section 4.8.  
Special populations 
A dose adjustment in terms of renal/hepatic impairment, age and sex is not considered warranted by the 
MAH. This is agreed.  
Race 
The impact of race on bimekizumab exposure was less pronounced than that of body weight. Simulations 
suggested that bimekizumab exposure following 160mg Q4W was comparable in Japanese, Chinese/other 
Asian, and Caucasian participants since the effect of faster clearance on exposure was offset by the 
smaller median body weight in Japanese and Chinese/other Asian participants compared with Caucasian 
participants. Therefore, a dose adjustment of bimekizumab in terms of race is not considered warranted 
by the MAH. This is agreed. SmPC section 5.2 has been updated to reflect that no clinically meaningful 
differences in bimekizumab exposure were observed in Chinese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects.  
Body weight 
In the popPK analysis, body weight had a significant impact on bimekizumab exposure following 160 mg 
Q4W. However, in the PK/PD model of ASAS response, the median ASAS response rates at Week 16 were 
only slightly increased when exposure increased (lower CL/F), and slightly decreased when exposure 
decreased (higher CL/F). The ASAS20 response rate ranged from 69% to 74%, compared to 72% for a 
typical CL/F. The ASAS40 response rate ranged from 44% to 52%, compared to 49% for a typical CL/F. 
Further, bimekizumab exposure following 160mg Q4W at the higher end of the exposure range in study 
participants with AxSpA did not appear to be associated with increased incidences of overall TEAEs and 
infection TEAEs. Therefore, a dose adjustment of bimekizumab in patients with axSpA is not considered 
warranted in terms of body weight, including overweight patients (≥120 kg). 
Drug Interactions 
The lack of DDI studies for this application is acceptable. Population PK data analyses indicated that the 
clearance of bimekizumab was not impacted by concomitant administration of conventional disease 
modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) including methotrexate, or by prior exposure to biologics (See 
SmPC section 4.5).  
Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
In study AS0008, the pharmacodynamic variables selected were appropriate. None of the immunological 
parameters selected showed significant dose or time dependent changes with bimekizumab treatment in 
adult participants with axSpA. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The omission of a thorough QT/QTC clinical study is acceptable.  
PK/PD modelling 
Phase 2  
The Phase 2 population PK/PD analysis was conducted to select the dose regimen/s to be tested in the 
pivotal Phase 3 studies. Based on the results, the selected dose regimen of 160 mg Q4W for patients with 
axSpA in the Phase 3 studies is considered appropriate. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 75/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 
The developed population PK-PD model provided a good description of the ER relationship between 
bimekizumab concentrations and the efficacy endpoint (ASAS). Covariates were identified and their 
impact on the ASAS response was evaluated. The results were used to inform the rationale for the 
proposed dose regimen in patients with axSpA. 
The final ASAS response model was a proportional odds model, where the probability of being an ASAS20 
or an ASAS40 responder was a function of the baseline probability, the treatment effect, and IIV. The 
probability of ASAS increased with increasing baseline hs-CRP, and with decreasing age. No further 
covariate effects were identified including disease indication (axSpa vs nr-axSpA), ADAb/Nab status, 
concomitant medications at Baseline (MTX, NSAIDs, csDMARDs, or corticosteroids) and WT. The VPCs 
indicated that the model was adequate for simulations. 
The ER relationship of bimekizumab and ASAS response was shown to be steep but reached a plateau by 
160 mg Q4W. The predicted median ASAS40 response rates at Week 16 were 16% for the placebo group 
and 27%, 41%, 48%, and 51% for 16 mg, 64 mg, 160 mg and 320 mg Q4W dosing regimens, 
respectively. This supports the proposed bimekizumab dose regimen of 160 mg Q4W for patients with 
axSpA. 
Variation in bimekizumab PK, as a result of PK covariate relationships (weight and race), had a limited 
impact on the predicted probability of ASAS response, assuming a 160 mg Q4W dosing regimen. See 
special populations for further discussion. 
The impact of baseline age and baseline hs-CRP on ASAS response rates was greater than the impact of 
PK covariate relationships. The ASAS response rates decreased with increasing age and increased with 
increasing baseline hs-CRP. However, in study participants with higher age or lower baseline hs-CRP 
levels, an increase in dose from 160 mg Q4W to 320 mg Q4W resulted in similar median ASAS response 
rate predictions, with overlapping prediction intervals. 
Exposure-safety analysis  
Bimekizumab plasma trough concentrations following 160 mg Q4W in Phase 3 studies were not 
associated with clinically relevant increases in incidences of TEAEs or infection. Bimekizumab doses up to 
320mg Q4W were tested in the Phase 2b study AS0008 and all doses were well-tolerated and had no 
unexpected safety signals. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The bimekizumab pharmacokinetics in adult patients with r-axSpA and nr-axSpA has been adequately 
characterised and the PK properties were similar in patients with plaque psoriasis and PsA. Section 5.2 of 
the SmPC was updated accordingly. The selected dose regimen of 160 mg Q4W for patients with axSpA in 
the Phase 3 studies is considered appropriate. Section 4.5 of the SmPC is updated to indicate that PK 
analyses have shown that drug clearance of bimekizumab was not impacted by concomitant 
administration of cDMARDs including methotrexate or by prior exposure to biologics.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
To support this extension of indication application, the MAH has submitted the results of a dose-finding 
study, AS0008. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 76/230 
 
 
 
 
 
This section will assess only the efficacy aspects of this clinical study. Other aspects are addressed in the 
relevant sections of this report. 
Design 
AS0008 was a Phase 2b, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-
ranging study to investigate the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of bimekizumab compared with placebo in 
adult study participants with active AS. Study participants were randomised 1:1:1:1:1 to 1 of 5 groups; 
placebo or bimekizumab 16mg, 64mg, 160mg, or 320mg sc Q4W. 
A total of 303 study participants were randomised as follows: 60 study participants in the placebo group, 
61 study participants in the bimekizumab 16mg group, 61 study participants in the bimekizumab 64mg 
group, 60 study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg group, and 61 study participants in the 
bimekizumab 320mg group. Overall, 297 study participants (98.0%) completed the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period, and the percentages of participants who completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period 
were high and similar across all groups. 
Patient characteristics 
Eligible subjects had to have active AS, determined by documented radiologic evidence (X-ray) fulfilling 
the Modified New York criteria for AS (1984), including symptoms for ≥3 months and age of onset <45. 
Furthermore, subjects will have moderate to severe active disease (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease 
Activity Index [BASDAI] ≥4 and spinal pain ≥4 [BASDAI Question 2]). Subjects must have at least 1 of the 
following: 1) inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, 2) intolerance 
to administration of at least 1 NSAID, or 3) contraindication(s) to NSAID therapy. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those applied in the pivotal phase 3 studies, AS0010 
and AS0011. 
Overall, treatment groups were well balanced, and demographics were similar across groups (age, 
gender, weight, race, ethnicity, and geographic region. The mean age of study participants was 42.16 
years (range: 21.0 to 75.0 years)]. Most study participants were male (84.5%) and white (98.3%). The 
mean body weight and mean BMI were 80.32kg and 26.87kg/m2. 
Treatment groups were well balanced with respect to AS-related and other baseline disease 
characteristics. Overall, the mean time since diagnosis of AS was 7.88 years (range: 0 to 37.3 years) with 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 77/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a mean age at diagnosis of AS of 34.79 years. The mean time since the onset of the first AS symptoms 
was 14.57 years (range: 0.2 to 47.2 years). Most study participants (89.1%) were positive for HLA-B27, 
a genetic marker associated with AS. 
Overall, these observed patient characteristics are similar to those observed in the later studies AS0010 
and AS0011. 
Efficacy results 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the ASAS40 response at Week 12. The dose-response relationship 
between treatment and ASAS40 response at week 12 was assessed with an ordered categorical analysis 
using a non-parametric correlation statistic of Mantel and Haenszel (Mantel and Haenszel, 1959) and 
modified ridit scores (Bross, 1958) with the corresponding p-value. The analysis included geographic 
region and prior TNF inhibitor exposure (yes/no) as stratification factors. The correlation between dose 
and ASAS40 response was evaluated at a 2-sided significance level of α=0.05 
•  ASAS40 response at Week 12 
Across the bimekizumab doses included in the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, a statistically significant 
dose response was observed in ASAS40 responder rates at Week 12 (p<0.001). This dose response was 
linear at bimekizumab doses up to 160mg, with ASAS40 responder rates at Week 12 ranging from 29.5% 
(bimekizumab 16mg) to 46.7% (bimekizumab 160mg). The ASAS40 responder rate at Week 12 in the 
placebo group was 13.3%. 
Based on the clinical data and the PK/PD analysis, a bimekizumab 160mg Q4W regimen was selected as 
the dose for both Initial Treatment Period (up to Week 16) and Maintenance Treatment Period (up to 
Week 52) in the 2 Phase 3 studies.

2.4.2.  Main studies 
To support this extension of indication application, the MAH has submitted the results of 2 pivotal efficacy 
studies. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 78/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These two efficacy studies, AS0010 and AS0011, were reported to be currently ongoing at the time of 
initial submission, and so the only complete dataset was related to that for patients who have completed 
the primary efficacy endpoint assessment at 16 weeks. However, data up to Week 24 was presented by 
the MAH. Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH submitted the final dataset comprising of the full 52-week 
Maintenance phase.  
The design and currently available efficacy results for these two studies are summarised in the following 
sections. 
2.4.2.1.  AS0010 (BE MOBILE 1) 
Title of Study 
A phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of bimekizumab in subjects active nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). 
Methods 
AS0010 is a multicentre, Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in subjects with nr-axSpA.  
Study participants who completed Week 52 may be eligible for enrolment in an OLE study (AS0014) with 
bimekizumab. Study participants who are ineligible for, or elect not to participate in, the extension study 
at Week 52 undergo a Safety Follow-Up (SFU) Visit at the end of the SFU Period. 
Interim analyses of all available data were conducted after the planned number of randomised study 
participants completed 24 weeks and were to be conducted after the completion of 52 weeks of treatment 
or withdrawal from IMP or the study. The final analysis of all available data was performed after all 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 79/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomised study participants have completed the SFU Visit or have withdrawn from the IMP and/or 
study, or enrolled in the OLE study. 
An independent DMC and adjudication committees periodically review and monitor safety data from this 
study.

•  Study participants who had taken a TNFα inhibitor must have experienced an inadequate response to 
previous treatment given at an approved dose for at least 12 weeks or have been intolerant to 
treatment. 
• 
Female study participants must have been postmenopausal, permanently sterilised. Or must have 
been willing to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the duration of the study. 
The exclusion criteria related to patient safety, concomitant medications, or known safety concerns with 
the IMP, and were appropriate. 
Those subjects who did not meet the radiographic inclusion criteria for AS0010 may have been eligible for 
inclusion to the related study AS0011. 
Treatments 
Eligible study participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either bimekizumab 160mg sc Q4W or placebo 
sc Q4W, and remain on allowable background medication, until Week 16. Thereafter, study participants 
randomised to bimekizumab remained on their randomised while those who received placebo were 
reallocated to receive bimekizumab 160mg Q4W. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of bimekizumab administered subcutaneously (sc) 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) compared to placebo in the treatment of study participants with active nr-axSpA. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the efficacy of bimekizumab compared to placebo 
To assess the safety and tolerability of bimekizumab 
To assess the impact of bimekizumab on patient-reported quality of life 
To assess the impact of bimekizumab on spinal mobility 
To assess the impact of bimekizumab on enthesitis and on peripheral arthritis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the ASAS40 response at Week 16. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study were as follows: 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 81/230 
 
 
 
 
 
• ASAS40 response at Week 16 in TNFα inhibitor-naïve study participants 
• Change from Baseline in BASDAI total score at Week 16 
• ASAS 20% (ASAS20) response at Week 16 
• ASAS partial remission (ASAS-PR) at Week 16 
• Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score major improvement (ASDAS-MI) at Week 16 
• ASAS 5 out of 6 criteria (ASAS5/6) response at Week 16 
• Change from Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) at Week 16 
• Change from Baseline in Nocturnal Spinal Pain score (based on NRS) at Week 16 
• Change from Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) total score at Week 16 
• Change from Baseline in the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) physical component summary 
(PCS) score at Week 16 
• Change from Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Metrology Index (BASMI) at Week 16 
• Change from Baseline in the Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis (MASES) Index in the 
subgroup of study participants with enthesitis at Baseline at Week 16 
• Enthesitis-free state based on the MASES Index in the subgroup of study participants with enthesitis at 
Baseline at Week 16 
Sample size 
Approximately 240 study participants were planned to be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
bimekizumab 160mg sc or placebo sc Q4W. All sample size and power calculations were done at a 
significance level of 0.05 in a 2-sided test. 
The sample size assumptions for bimekizumab versus placebo were based on the ASAS40 response data 
from the Phase 2b bimekizumab study in study participants with active AS (AS0008) and assumed an 
ASAS40 response at Week 16 of 40% for the bimekizumab treatment group and 20% for the placebo 
group. 
With 120 study participants in the bimekizumab treatment group and 120 study participants in the 
placebo group, the 2-sided 2-sample continuity-corrected chi square test for detecting statistical 
superiority of bimekizumab versus placebo based on ASAS40 response at Week 16 was powered with 
90%. 
Randomisation 
Patients were appropriately randomised into treatment groups. An IXRS was used for assigning eligible 
study participants to a treatment regimen based on a predetermined randomisation schedule produced by 
the IXRS vendor. Study participants’ treatment assignment was stratified by region and by presence of 
sacroiliitis on MRI and elevated CRP to ensure balanced treatment allocation across 3 levels: MRI 
positive/CRP positive, MRI positive/CRP negative, and MRI negative/CRP positive. Enrollment of TNFα 
inhibitor-experienced study participants was limited to 30% of the total study population. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 82/230 
 
 
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
Due to differences in presentation between bimekizumab and placebo treatments, special precautions 
were taken to ensure study blinding, and study sites had blinded and unblinded personnel. 
Bimekizumab and placebo injections were administered at the investigational sites by unblinded, 
dedicated study personnel according to the site-specific blinding plan. The unblinded personnel were not 
involved in the study in any way other than assuring the medication was taken from the correct kit and 
prepared according to the pharmacy manual instructions and administering the drug to the study 
participants. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The original SAP, dated 05 June 2019, was amended twice. 
-  Amendment 1 of the SAP, dated 05 August 2021, was implemented in response to protocol 
amendment 4 (16 February 2021) and discussions and feedback provided at meetings between 
the sponsor and CRO technical teams or for clarifications, as well as to incorporate feedback from 
FDA on missing data methods. The main changes were rules for handling missing data and 
guidelines on the implementation of MI and latest guidelines from the bimekizumab AE of special 
monitoring convention document. 
-  Amendment 2 of the SAP, dated 12 Nov 2021, was implemented to fix formatting issues in the 
SAP document and to add clarifications on how to analyse specific data.  
All amendments to the original SAP were comprehensively described in SAP Amendment 2. 
Changes to the planned analyses 
Changes to protocol-defined analyses 
The following changes relative to the protocol-defined analyses were included in the SAP: 
• 
The protocol mentioned that subgroup analyses using descriptive statistics were to be performed 
on the primary efficacy endpoint. In addition, Ors for the comparison of bimekizumab versus 
placebo and associated 95% CI were calculated.  
•  Race was analysed as additional subgroup endpoint. 
• 
• 
The MS was added as additional analysis set. 
The primary/main analysis of continuous secondary efficacy endpoints which were part of the 
sequential testing procedure, as well as the components of the primary ASAS40 endpoint, used a 
reference-based imputation method. 
In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on study procedures/conduct and on the primary 
efficacy endpoint and safety analyses (TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and IMP withdrawal due to TEAEs) were 
investigated and additional analysis outputs are provided as appropriate. These additional analyses were 
not planned as part of the protocol, as the pandemic was not ongoing at the time of protocol finalisation. 
These additional analyses include analyses by period of the COVID-19 pandemic (prior/during/post), for 
study participant disposition, details of impacted visits and effects on collection and reporting of efficacy 
data, protocol deviations, exposure, and Aes. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 83/230 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the primary analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was repeated by timing of the Week 16 
Visit relative to the start and end of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
For study participants participating in the MRI substudy, the protocol-defined time window for performing 
the MRIs of the spine and sacroiliac joints for MRI-positive and MRI-negative study participants at Week 
16 and Week 52 was ±5 days. However, the MRIs performed within ±3 weeks were accepted for Week 16 
and Week 52 after consultation with imaging experts. 
Additional changes to the planned analyses 
Exportation of samples from China was not possible at the time of Week 24 CSR preparation and thus the 
Immunogenicity SS was used for ADAb and Nab analyses in the interim Week 24 report. 
Analysis Populations 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed for all study participants in the Randomised Set (RS), and 
supportive analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and 
the Per-Protocol Set (PPS). All other efficacy endpoints were based on the RS. 
Demographics tables were produced using the RS as well as the Safety Set (SS), if the SS was different 
from the RS. Safety endpoints were summarized on the SS. Pharmacokinetic endpoints were analysed for 
all study participants in the SS and/or Pharmacokinetic Per-Protocol Set (PK-PPS). 
The Enrolled Set (ES) was to consist of all study participants who had given informed consent.  
The Randomized Set (RS) was to consist of all enrolled study participants that had been randomized.  
The Safety Set (SS) was to consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP. Subjects in 
the SS were to be analysed according to the treatment they actually received. 
The Maintenance Set (MS) was to consist of all study participants who received at least 1 dose of 
bimekizumab treatment in the Maintenance Period. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was to consist of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
the IMP and had valid measurements of all components of the primary efficacy variable at Baseline.  
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) was to consist of all subjects in the RS who had no important protocol 
deviation (IPD) affecting the primary efficacy variable. Important protocol deviations were to be 
predefined and study participants with important protocol deviations evaluated during ongoing data 
cleaning and data evaluation meetings prior to unblinding of the data. Exclusions from the FAS were 
considered as an IPD that also resulted in exclusion from the PPS. Additional exclusions from the PPS due 
to a protocol-permitted decrease in dosing or dosing frequency of axSpA background medication due to 
intolerance/AE/side effects may have also been possible in case a potential impact on the primary 
endpoint cannot be excluded. 
In addition, if after unblinding it was determined that there were study participants who were dosed with 
bimekizumab in place of placebo, then these study participants were removed from the PPS. Study 
participants who received a single dose with placebo in place of bimekizumab remained in the PPS, but 
participants who received more than a single dose with placebo (or received 1 dose with placebo and also 
missed 1 or more additional doses, therefore fulfilling the IPD criterion of more than 1 missed dose up to 
Week 12 during the Double-Blind Treatment Period) when randomised to bimekizumab were excluded 
from the PPS. 
The Pharmacokinetics Per-Protocol Set (PK-PPS) was to consist of all randomised subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of bimekizumab and provided at least 1 quantifiable plasma concentration post-
dose (after first IMP administration) without important protocol deviations that would affect the 
concentration.  
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 84/230 
 
 
 
 
 
A separate Immunogenicity Safety Set was defined in SAP Amendment 2 to include all randomised 
study participants, excluding China participants, who received at least 1 dose of IMP in the event that 
sample exportation from China was not approved. Exportation of all samples from China was not possible 
at the time of Week 24 CSR preparation and thus the Immunogenicity SS was used for ADAb and Nab 
analyses in this Week 24 report and only includes available samples from non-Chinese study participants. 
The COVID-19-free Set consisted of all study participants in the RS who had no COVID-19 impact up to 
the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Efficacy analyses were to be performed according to randomisation and not actual treatment received. 
Analysis of primary endpoint – ASAS40 response at week 16 
Derivation of the ASAS40 response 
The ASAS40 response is defined as: 
•  An improvement of at least 40%, and an absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 0 to 10 
NRS in at least 3 of the 4 following domains: 
−  PGADA 
−  Pain assessment (Total Spinal Pain, Question 1 from total and Nocturnal Spinal Pain) 
−  Physical function (measured by the BASFI) 
− 
Inflammation (represented by the mean of the BASDAI Questions 5 and 6) concerning 
morning stiffness intensity and duration) 
•  And no worsening at all in the remaining domain. 
The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the composite estimand (NRI) that combined the clinically 
meaningful improvement from Baseline in ASAS40 response at Week 16 and the IE of not discontinuing 
early from study treatment for any reason prior to Week 16. Note that only permanent discontinuations 
were considered as Ies. This definition was applicable to all analyses. 
The following 4 attributes described the composite estimand that was used to define the treatment effect 
of interest for the primary efficacy analysis: 
• Population = Study participants enrolled according to the protocol-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and randomized to IMP. 
• Study participant-level outcome = ASAS40 at Week 16. 
• Intercurrent Event (IE) handling = An IE was defined as discontinuation of study treatment prior to 
Week 16. A composite strategy was implemented in which a positive clinical outcome was defined as 
achieving ASAS40 at Week 16 and not discontinuing study treatment through Week 16. 
• Population-level summary measure = Conditional OR comparing bimekizumab to placebo. 
Intercurrent events were acknowledged as an unfavorable outcome for the composite estimand in 
considering study participants with Ies as nonresponders to the study treatment. Consequently, if the 
date of an IE (as defined in the SAP) occurred prior to or at Week 16, study participants were considered 
as nonresponders at Week 16. Additionally, missing data at Week 16 that were not preceded by an IE 
were imputed as nonresponders. 
A logistic regression model was used to assess the treatment effect on ASAS40 response at Week 16. The 
model included fixed effects for treatment and stratification endpoints of MRI/CRP classification and 
region. The suitability of including these endpoints in the model was assessed using the Hosmer-
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 85/230 
 
 
 
 
 
Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. If the logistic regression model was unable to converge the stratification 
factors could be dropped to facilitate the model convergence.  
The summary table results presented the number of responders, adjusted responder rates, and 
associated 95% confidence interval (CI) for bimekizumab and placebo, the adjusted OR and 95% CI for 
the comparison of bimekizumab versus placebo, and the p-value testing the null hypothesis that the 
OR=1. The treatment comparison was made using the 2-sided Wald test at a significance level of α=0.05. 
The following supportive analyses for the primary efficacy variable were conducted: 
•  Analysis on the PPS 
•  Analysis on the FAS (to be performed if the number of study participants in RS and FAS differ) 
•  Analysis using a modified composite estimand where the single identified intercurrent event is 
defined as discontinuation due to AE or lack of efficacy 
•  Analysis of individual components of the ASAS40 (using hypothetical estimand where the single 
intercurrent event is discontinuation of study treatment prior to week 16 and 
missing data and nonmissing data after the IE (reset as missing) were imputed using reference-
based MI) 
•  Analyses using treatment policy strategy for the single identified intercurrent event of 
discontinuation of study treatment prior to week 16 
•  Analysis of observed cases 
•  Tipping point analysis, including a worst-case scenario where study participants who had missing 
ACR50 response were set as nonresponders if they were randomized to bimekizumab and as 
responders if they were randomized to placebo 
•  Analysis including COVID-19 impact 
Analysis of ranked secondary endpoints 
Eleven key secondary endpoints were included in the testing hierarchy. 
The following analyses were conducted for the secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• 
For the secondary binary endpoints: 
-  Composite Estimand – NRI: The same composite estimand structure as the one defined in for the 
primary efficacy analysis was used. The same analysis model was considered, and the analysis 
results were presented similarly as for the primary efficacy analysis. The imputation strategy for 
handling missing data was the same as for the primary endpoint; i.e. the NRI approach. 
-  Modified Composite – MI: A similar modified composite estimand structure as the one defined for 
the primary efficacy analysis was used. The same analysis model was considered, and the 
analysis results were presented similarly as for the primary efficacy analysis.  
-  Observed Case analysis 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 86/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the secondary continuous endpoints: 
-  Reference-Based Estimand – MI: The same hypothetical estimand structure as the one defined in 
for the analysis on component endpoints for the primary efficacy endpoint was used. The same 
analysis model and imputation strategy for handling missing data was also considered. The 
analysis results were presented similarly as for this analysis on the individual ASAS40 
components. 
-  Hypothetical Estimand – MI where the single intercurrent event is discontinuation of study 
treatment prior to week 16 and missing data and nonmissing data after the IE (reset as missing) 
were imputed under a MAR assumption 
-  Observed Case Analysis 
- 
to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary analysis of all secondary efficacy 
endpoints included in the testing hierarchy were analysed on the CFS, using the reference-based 
estimand. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroups analyses were performed for the primary endpoint ASAS40, and ASDAS-MI as shown in the 
Table 33 below. In addition, ASAS40 was analysed based on the timing of participant enrolment and 
timing of the Week 16 Visit relative to the COVID-19 pandemic periods.  
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 87/230 
 
 
 
 
 
Multicentre study 
The data from all centers were pooled for the purposes of the analysis. Centers were grouped in the 
geographic regions of North America/Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia. 
The percentage of randomised study participants was less than 10% in North America. To avoid modeling 
convergence issues across efficacy endpoints, North America was combined with Western Europe to 
create a new geographic region stratum for efficacy modeling. This new pooled geographic region stratum 
was then used for any modeling (including MI, logistic regression, and mixed model), including subgroup 
analyses. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 88/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No exploration of treatment by center interaction was investigated. 
Type I error control 
A fixed sequence testing procedure was applied for the primary endpoint and the key secondary 
endpoints. The testing procedure accounted for multiplicity and controlled the family-wise type I error 
rate at alpha=0.05 (2-sided). 
For each test, on each binary efficacy endpoint, the null hypothesis was that the conditional odds ratio 
(OR) was equal to 1 (H0: ORT1T2 = 1). The alternative hypothesis was that the conditional OR was not 
equal to 1 (HA: ORT1T2 ≠ 1). 
For each test, on each continuous efficacy endpoint, the null hypothesis was that there was no 
difference between treatment groups (H0: T1 – T2 = 0). The alternative hypothesis was that there was a 
difference between treatment groups (HA: T1 – T2 ≠0). 
In these hypotheses, T1 referred to bimekizumab and T2 to placebo. 
According to this strategy, the statistical testing of an endpoint could be investigated only if the null 
hypothesis for the previous endpoint had been rejected (ie, if p<0.05). 
The testing order for these endpoints is shown in the figure below: 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 89/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interim analyses 
In AS0010, two analyses were to be performed prior to the final analysis: 
•  Analysis 1: Week 24 analysis. 
•  Analysis 2: Week 52 analysis. 
No formal alterations to the further study conduct (e.g., stopping rules, sample size re-estimation, or 
changes to eligibility criteria) were planned for the 2 interim analyses (Week 24 and Week 52). No 
separate SAP for the Week 24 analyses was to be provided. The TFL shells for the Week 24 and the Week 
52 analyses were provided in the same document and appropriately identified. The type of efficacy and 
safety analyses to be provided for the 2 interim analyses was detailed in the SAP. 
The final analysis for AS0010 consisted of a rerun of all analyses provided during the preceding interim 
analysis. This includes new SFU data that were not available for the Week 52 analysis. If there was no 
SFU data ongoing, the final analysis would be identical to the Week 52 analysis. 
Results 
Screening for AS0010 started on 25 April 2019 and completed on 11 June 2021.  
A total of 781 study participants signed the ICF and were screened for the study, 527 of whom were 
screen failures (67.5%). The most common reason for screen failure was ineligibility due to not meeting 
one or more inclusion criteria. 
A total of 254 study participants were randomised in the global population and started treatment in 
AS0010. Study participants were randomised 1:1 to either bimekizumab 160mg sc Q4W or placebo sc 
Q4W. 
Most study participants completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period and were similar for both 
bimekizumab and placebo (98.4% and 93.7% respectively). The most common primary reasons for 
discontinuation during the Double-Blind Treatment Period were due to withdrawal by study participant (4 
study participants [1.6%]) and an AE (4 study participants [1.6%]). 
Recruitment 
Recruitment was appropriately conducted in accordance with the protocol. Screening for AS0010 started 
on 25 Apr 2019 and completed on 11 Jun 2021. A total of 781 study participants signed the ICF and were 
screened for the study, 527 of whom were screen failures (67.5%). The most common reason for screen 
failure was ineligibility (499 study participants [63.9%]). 
Conduct of the study 
Overall, the study was conducted appropriately. There have been 4 protocol amendments to date; 
however, none of these are felt to have diminished the integrity of the trial. 
The Covid-19 pandemic does not seem to have had any material impact on the conduct of the trial. 
While 3.5% of patients did experience one or more protocol deviations, for the most part these were 
minor – bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (3.9%) and placebo (3.2%) groups. Overall, the most common 
protocol deviation was prohibited concomitant medication use, with an incidence of 1.6% in the 
bimekizumab group and 2.4% in the placebo group. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 90/230 
 
 
 
 
 
Baseline data 
Overall, baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups. There were some slight 
differences between the groups with respect to BMI and gender between the two groups (<25kg/m2: 
43.8%; and males: 57.0% and females: 43.0% and <25kg/m2: 36.5%; and males: 51.6% and females: 
48.4% between the treatment and placebo groups respectively). 
The majority of study participants were White (86.2%). The mean body weight and mean BMI overall 
were 80.91kg and 27.42kg/m2, respectively. For each treatment group, the number of study participants 
in the MRI+/CRP- stratification level was slightly higher (41.7%) compared with MRI+/CRP+ (31.9%) and 
MRI-/CRP+ (26.4%) stratification levels. 
Study participants were most commonly enrolled in the following countries: Poland (28.0%), the Czech 
Republic (20.9%), Spain (10.2%), Germany (9.4%), and the United States (7.1%). 
The Baseline disease characteristics were reflective of a study population with active nr-axSpA and high 
burden of disease despite standard of care treatment. Overall, the mean times since first diagnosis and 
first symptoms of axSpA were 3.60 years (range: 0.1 to 31.3 years) and 9.02 years (range: 0.4 to 45.1 
years), respectively. Most of the study participants (77.6%) were positive for HLA-B27, a genetic marker 
associated with axSpA. Treatment groups were generally well balanced with respect to nr-axSpA-related 
and other Baseline disease characteristics. 
Prior anti-TNF therapy was used by 10.6% of all study participants. At Baseline, the majority of all study 
participants were using NSAID therapies (74.8%), 24.4% were on conventional synthetic DMARDs, 8.3% 
were taking oral corticosteroids, and 16.5% were on analgesic/opioid therapies.

Numbers analysed 
The RS and SS consisted of the same study participants, with 128 study participants in the bimekizumab 
group and 126 study participants in the placebo/bimekizumab group. The MS included the same study 
participants as the RS and SS, except for the 10 study participants who discontinued during the Double-
Blind Treatment Period and the 2 study participants who completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period 
but did not enter the Maintenance Period. The FAS included the same study participants as the RS and 
SS. Most of the study participants were included in the PPS (96.9%) and in the PK-PPS (96.1%). The 
Immunogenicity SS included a lower number of study participants, 93.0% in the bimekizumab group and 
94.4% in the placebo/bimekizumab group, as this analysis set excluded Chinese study participants. The 
CFS included a majority of the same study participants as the RS for the bimekizumab group (92.2%) 
and the placebo/bimekizumab group (92.1%).

Outcomes and estimation 
The results of the primary and key secondary efficacy variables are provided below. Overall, bimekizumab 
treatment resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences over placebo for the 
primary and all key secondary endpoints included in the predefined sequential testing sequence 
(p<0.001). 
A tabular summary of these results is presented below.

Primary efficacy endpoint – ASAS40 at Week 16 
The bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a higher ASAS40 response rate compared with the placebo 
group at Week 16 that was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (47.7% vs 21.4%, 
respectively; p<0.001). 
The ASAS40 response rate further increased from week 16 (47.7%) to week 52 (60.9%) for participants 
in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
Table 36: ASAS40 response rates at Week 16 (RS [NRI]) 
In addition, the bimekizumab group had improvement over placebo for each of the ASAS40 components 
(shown as difference of bimekizumab-placebo): PGADA (-1.75); Total Spinal Pain (-1.63); BASFI score 
(function) (-1.48); BASDAI Q5/Q6 mean score (inflammation) (-1.73); and all other sensitivity analyses.

Table 37: Change from Baseline in individual components of ASAS40 response at Week 16 (RS 
[reference-based MI]) 
The supportive analyses of the primary endpoint were consistent with the results of the primary analysis. 
The results of the supportive analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints were in line with the primary 
efficacy results. When ASAS40 response rates were analysed with alternative missing data methods (MI, 
Treatment Policy Strategy, OC, or the Tipping Point Analysis) and with additional analysis sets (PPS and 
COVID-19 Free Set), the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had higher ASAS40 response rates compared 
with the placebo group (nominal p≤0.001 for all comparisons). Additionally, there was no evidence that 
the timing of the Week 16 Visit relative to the COVID-19 pandemic had an effect on ASAS40 response 
rates for bimekizumab and placebo.

Responder Rate at Week 16 
Analysis Set: Randomized Set 
Subgroup analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
Overall, a consistent trend of increased ASAS40 response rates in the bimekizumab group compared with 
the placebo group was evident across all subgroups. The difference between response rates in the 
bimekizumab compared with placebo was less pronounced for female participants, participants ≥45 years 
of age, and participants in Western Europe and North America. Participants with a BMI of ≥30kg/m2 in 
the bimekizumab group had a response rate of 28.1% (OR 95% CI: 0.45 to 3.81) compared to 23.1% in 
the placebo group.  
In participants <45 years of age, the ASAS40 response rate at Week 16 in the bimekizumab group 
(59.3%) was higher compared with the placebo group (26.4%). In participants ≥45 years of age, the 
ASAS40 response rate was lower than in participants <45 years of age. In this older age category, the 
ASAS40 response rate was higher in the bimekizumab group (23.8%) compared with the placebo group 
(10.3%). 
In participants with a BMI of ≥18.5 to <25kg/m2, the ASAS40 response rate in the bimekizumab group 
(50.9%) was higher compared with placebo (17.8%), which was similar in participants with a BMI of ≥25 
to <30kg/m2 where the ASAS40 response rate was higher in the bimekizumab group (57.5%) compared 
with the placebo group (24.4%). In participants with a BMI of ≥30kg/m2, the ASAS40 response rate in 
the bimekizumab group (28.1%) was lower than in participants with a BMI of ≥18.5 to <25kg/m2 or ≥25 
to <30kg/m2 and similar to the placebo group (23.1%). 
In male participants, the ASAS40 response rate at Week 16 in the bimekizumab group (57.5%) was 
higher compared with the placebo group (21.5%). In female participants, the ASAS40 response rate was 
lower than male participants, but was higher in the bimekizumab group (34.5%) compared with the 
placebo group (21.3%).

In participants with prior TNFα inhibitor exposure, the ASAS40 response rate at Week 16 in the 
bimekizumab group (60.0%) was higher compared with placebo (11.8%). Results were similar in 
participants with no prior TNFα inhibitor exposure, where the ASAS40 response was higher in the 
bimekizumab group (46.6%) compared with the placebo group (22.9%). However, the sample size for 
study participants with prior TNFα inhibitor exposure was small, and conclusions should be drawn with 
caution. 
For the region subgroups, the bimekizumab group had higher ASAS40 response rates compared with 
placebo in participants from Eastern Europe (50.7% vs 18.3%, respectively), Asia (46.7% vs 15.4%, 
respectively), and a slightly higher ASAS40 response rate in Western Europe and North America (42.5% 
vs 28.6%, respectively). In the bimekizumab group, the ASAS40 response rate was higher in Eastern 
Europe (50.7%) compared with Asia (46.7%), which was also higher compared with Western Europe and 
North America (42.5%).

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Bimekizumab treatment resulted in statistically significant improvements over placebo for all key 
secondary endpoints included in the predefined sequential testing sequence, which resulted in meaningful 
improvement after bimekizumab treatment (as presented in Figure 31 above). In addition, improvements 
after bimekizumab treatment over placebo were observed for BASMI, MASES index, enthesitis-free state 
based on MASES, and ASAS40 response in TNFα inhibitor-naïve participants, as presented below. 
The bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a LS mean decrease from Baseline in BASMI at week 16 
(decreases reflect improvement) which was greater than the placebo group (-0.44 vs -0.11, respectively; 
nominal p=0.0005) (Table 38). A summary of change from Baseline in BASMI score at Week 16 is 
presented for the RS (MI) in Table 38. 
Table 38: BASMI change from Baseline at Week 16 (RS [MI]) 
In the subgroup of study participants with enthesitis at Baseline (MASES index score >0), the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a LS mean decrease from Baseline in the MASES index at Week 16 
(decreases reflect improvement) which was greater than the placebo group (-2.16 vs -1.12, respectively; 
nominal p=0.014) (Table 39). A summary of change from Baseline in MASES index at Week 16 in the 
subgroup of study participants with enthesitis at Baseline is presented for the RS (MI) in Table 39.

Upon CHMP’s request, data at week 52 were presented by the MAH. The ASAS40 response rate in anti-
TNF alpha naïve patients further increased from week 16 46.6% to week 52 61.9% for participants in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. The ASAS20 response rate further increased slightly from Week 16 
(68.8%) to Week 52 (73.4%) in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. The ASAS-PR response rates 
further increased slightly from Week 16 (25.8%) to Week 52 (29.7%) for participants in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group. The ASDAS-MI response rates further increased from Week 16 (27.3%) to Week 52 
(36.7%) for participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group.  
The change from Baseline in MASES index score further decreased from Week 16 (-2.38) to Week 52 (-
3.61) for participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. The proportion of participants reaching an 
enthesitis-free state was similar at Week 16 (51.1%) and Week 52 (54.3%) for participants in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
The change from Baseline in mean NSP Score further decreased from Week 16 (-3.6) to Week 52 (-4.3) 
for participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
The change from Baseline in BASMI score further decreased from Week 16 (-0.4) to Week 52 (-0.6) for 
study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
The mean change from Baseline in BASDAI total score further decreased from Week 16 (-3.1) to Week 52 
(-3.9) for participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
Other secondary endpoints 
The other secondary endpoints presented below were considered clinically relevant.  
The proportion of patients in reaching ASDAS <2.1 (combining ASDAS-inactive disease (ID) and ASDAS-
low disease (LD)) at Week 16 was 46.1% in the bimekizumab group versus 21.1% in the placebo group 
(multiple imputation). At Week 52, 61.6% of patients in the bimekizumab group achieved an ASDAS 
<2.1, including 25.2% in inactive disease state (ASDAS <1.3). 
Table 42: ASDAS status (ID, LD, HD, and vHD) by visit (RS [MI]) 
The BASDAI50 response rate for study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group increased up 
to Week 16, and the BASDAI50 response rate was greater in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
(46.9%) compared with the placebo group (21.4%) at Week 16 (Table 43). The BASDAI50 response rates 
EMA/235041/2023

further increased from Week 16 (46.9%) to Week 52 (53.9%) for participants in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W group. 
In participants who switched from placebo to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, the BASDAI50 response rate 
markedly increased from Week 16 (21.4%) to Week 24 (46.0%) and was further increased slightly to 
Week 52 (49.2%) (Table 43).

Change from Baseline in hs-CRP 
The geometric mean hs-CRP ratio to Baseline was lower in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (0.445) 
compared with the placebo group (0.882) at week 2 (LS means difference 95% CI: -6.99 to -2.94; 
nominal p<0.001) (Table 44). 
In the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, the geometric mean hs-CRP ratios to Baseline were similar from 
Week 2 (0.445) to Week 16 (0.438). In the placebo group, the geometric mean hs-CRP ratios to Baseline 
were similar from Week 2 (0.882) to Week 16 (0.721). At Week 16, hs-CRP ratios remained lower in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (0.438) compared with the placebo group (0.721) (Table 44). 
The geometric mean hs-CRP ratios to Baseline were similar at Week 16 (0.438) and Week 52 (0.361) for 
participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
In participants who switched from placebo to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, geometric mean hs-CRP ratios 
to Baseline markedly decreased from Week 16 (0.721) to Week 24 (0.467) and further decreased slightly 
to Week 52 (0.402) (Table 44).

Title of Study 
A phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of bimekizumab in subjects active axial spondyloarthritis. 
Methods 
AS0011 is a multicentre, Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in study participants with active AS, a subtype of axSpA with 
radiographic sacroiliitis (r-axSpA). To be eligible to participate in this study, study participants must have 
been adults with a diagnosis of active AS (as defined), including at least 3 months of symptoms and age 
at symptom onset <45 years, and moderate to severe active disease at Baseline. 
Eligible study participants were randomized 2:1 to receive 1 of 2 treatments (bimekizumab 160mg sc 
Q4W or placebo sc Q4W) and remained on their allowable background medication. At the end of the 16-
week Double-Blind Treatment Period, study participants receiving placebo were re-allocated to 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W treatment at Week 16 after all assessments had been completed. 
EMA/235041/2023

Study participants who complete Week 52 may be eligible for enrolment in an OLE study with 
bimekizumab. Study participants who are ineligible for, or elect not to participate in, the extension study 
at Week 52 undergo a Safety Follow-Up (SFU) Visit at the end of the SFU Period. 
Interim analyses of all available data were conducted after the planned number of randomised study 
participants completed 24 weeks and was conducted after the completion of 52 weeks of treatment or 
withdrawal from IMP or the study. The final analysis of all available data was performed after all 
randomised study participants have completed the SFU Visit or have withdrawn from the IMP and/or 
study, or enrolled in the OLE study. 
An independent DMC and adjudication committees periodically review and monitor safety data from this 
study.

The exclusion criteria related to patient safety, concomitant medications, or known safety concerns with 
the IMP, and were appropriate. 
Treatments 
Eligible study participants were randomised 2:1 to receive either bimekizumab 160mg sc Q4W or placebo 
Q4w sc, and remain on allowable background medication, until Week 16. Thereafter, study participants 
randomised to bimekizumab remained on their randomised while those who received placebo were 
reallocated to receive bimekizumab 160mg Q4W. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of bimekizumab administered subcutaneously (sc) 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) compared to placebo in the treatment of study participants with active AS. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
• 
•

Sample size 
Approximately 300 study participants were planned to be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 
bimekizumab 160mg sc or placebo sc Q4W. All sample size and power calculations were done at a 
significance level of 0.05 in a 2-sided test. 
The sample size assumptions for bimekizumab versus placebo were based on the ASAS40 response data 
from the Phase 2b bimekizumab study in study participants with active AS (AS0008) and assumed an 
ASAS40 response at Week 16 of 40% for the bimekizumab treatment group and 15% for the placebo 
group. 
With 200 study participants in the bimekizumab treatment group and 100 study participants in the 
placebo group, the 2-sided, 2-sample, continuity-corrected chi-square test for detecting statistical 
superiority of bimekizumab versus placebo based on ASAS40 response at Week 16 was powered with 
>99%. 
Blinding (masking) 
Due to differences in presentation between bimekizumab and placebo treatments, special precautions 
were taken to ensure study blinding, and study sites had blinded and unblinded personnel. 
Bimekizumab and placebo injections were administered at the investigational sites by unblinded, 
dedicated study personnel according to the site-specific blinding plan. The unblinded personnel were not 
involved in the study in any way other than assuring the medication was taken from the correct kit and 
prepared according to the pharmacy manual instructions and administering the drug to the study 
participants.

Randomisation 
An IXRS was used for assigning eligible study participants to a treatment regimen based on a 
predetermined randomization schedule was produced by the IXRS vendor. Study participants’ treatment 
assignment was stratified by region and prior TNFα inhibitor exposure (yes/no). Enrollment of TNFα 
inhibitor-experienced study participants was limited to 30% of the total study population. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The original SAP, dated 05 June 2019, was amended twice. 
−  Amendment 1 of the SAP, dated 05 August 2021, was implemented in response to protocol 
amendment 4 (16 February 2021) and discussions and feedback provided at meetings between 
UCB and PAREXEL technical teams or for clarifications, as well as to incorporate feedback from 
FDA on missing data methods. The main changes are rules for handling missing data and 
guidelines on the implementation of MI and latest guidelines from the bimekizumab AE of special 
monitoring convention document. 
−  Amendment 2 of the SAP, dated 15 November 2021, was implemented to to fix formatting issues 
in the SAP document and to add clarifications on how to analyze specific data.  
All amendments to the original SAP are comprehensively described in SAP Amendment 2. 
Changes to the planned analyses 
Changes to protocol-defined analyses 
The following changes relative to the protocol-defined analyses were included in the SAP: 
• 
The protocol mentioned that subgroup analyses using descriptive statistics were to be performed 
on the primary efficacy endpoint. In addition, Ors for the comparison of bimekizumab versus 
placebo and associated 95% CI were calculated.  
•  Race was analysed as additional subgroup endpoint. 
• 
• 
The MS was added as additional analysis set. 
The primary/main analysis of continuous secondary efficacy endpoints which were part of the 
sequential testing procedure, as well as the components of the primary ASAS40 endpoint, used a 
reference-based imputation method. 
In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on study procedures/conduct and on the primary 
efficacy endpoint and safety analyses (TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and IMP withdrawal due to TEAEs) were 
investigated and additional analysis outputs are provided as appropriate. These additional analyses were 
not planned as part of the protocol, as the pandemic was not ongoing at the time of protocol finalisation. 
These additional analyses include analyses by period of the COVID-19 pandemic (prior/during/post), for 
study participant disposition, details of impacted visits and effects on collection and reporting of efficacy 
data, protocol deviations, exposure, and Aes. 
In addition, the primary analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was repeated by timing of the Week 16 
Visit relative to the start and end of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
For study participants participating in the MRI substudy, the protocol-defined time window for performing 
the MRIs of the spine and sacroiliac joints for MRI-positive and MRI-negative study participants at Week 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 112/230 
 
 
 
 
 
16 and Week 52 was ±5 days. However, the MRIs performed within ±3 weeks were accepted for Week 16 
and Week 52 after consultation with imaging experts. 
Additional changes to the planned analyses 
Exportation of samples from China was not possible at the time of Week 24 CSR preparation and thus the 
Immunogenicity SS was used for ADAb and Nab analyses in this Week 24 report. 
Analysis Populations 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed for all study participants in the Randomized Set (RS), and 
supportive analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint were performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and 
the Per-Protocol Set (PPS). All other efficacy endpoints were based on the RS. 
Demographics tables were produced using the RS as well as the Safety Set (SS), if the SS was different 
from the RS. Safety endpoints were summarized on the SS. Pharmacokinetic endpoints were analysed for 
all study participants in the SS and/or Pharmacokinetic Per-Protocol Set (PK-PPS). 
The Enrolled Set (ES) was to consist of all study participants who had given informed consent.  
The Randomized Set (RS) was to consist of all enrolled study participants that had been randomized.  
The Safety Set (SS) was to consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP. Subjects in 
the SS were to be analysed according to the treatment they actually received. 
The Maintenance Set (MS) was to consist of all study participants who received at least 1 dose of 
bimekizumab treatment in the Maintenance Period. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was to consist of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
the IMP and had valid measurements of all components of the primary efficacy variable at Baseline.  
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) was to consist of all subjects in the RS who had no important protocol 
deviation (IPD) affecting the primary efficacy variable. Important protocol deviations were to be 
predefined and study participants with important protocol deviations evaluated during ongoing data 
cleaning and data evaluation meetings prior to unblinding of the data. Exclusions from the FAS were 
considered as an IPD that also resulted in exclusion from the PPS. Additional exclusions from the PPS due 
to a protocol-permitted decrease in dosing or dosing frequency of axSpA background medication due to 
intolerance/AE/side effects may have also been possible in case a potential impact on the primary 
endpoint cannot be excluded. 
In addition, if after unblinding it was determined that there were study participants who were dosed with 
bimekizumab in place of placebo, then these study participants were removed from the PPS. Study 
participants who received a single dose with placebo in place of bimekizumab remained in the PPS, but 
participants who received more than a single dose with placebo (or received 1 dose with placebo and also 
missed 1 or more additional doses, therefore fulfilling the IPD criterion of more than 1 missed dose up to 
Week 12 during the Double-Blind Treatment Period) when randomized to bimekizumab were excluded 
from the PPS. 
The Pharmacokinetics Per-Protocol Set (PK-PPS) was to consist of all randomized subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of bimekizumab and provided at least 1 quantifiable plasma concentration post-
dose (after first IMP administration) without important protocol deviations that would affect the 
concentration.  
A separate Immunogenicity Safety Set was defined in SAP Amendment 2 to include all randomised 
study participants, excluding China participants, who received at least 1 dose of IMP in the event that 
sample exportation from China was not approved. Exportation of all samples from China was not possible 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 113/230 
 
 
 
 
 
at the time of Week 24 CSR preparation and thus the Immunogenicity SS was used for ADAb and Nab 
analyses in this Week 24 report and only includes available samples from non-Chinese study participants. 
The COVID-19-free Set consisted of all study participants in the RS who had no COVID-19 impact up to 
the primary efficacy endpoint. This was defined as study participants (up to Week 16): 
•  not having a COVID-19 related IPD 
•  not having an impact based on the COVID-19 eCRF 
•  not having an AE related to COVID-19 
•  not discontinuing due to COVID-19 
Efficacy analyses were to be performed according to randomisation and not actual treatment received. 
Analysis of primary endpoint – ASAS40 response at week 16 
Derivation of the ASAS40 response 
The ASAS40 response is defined as: 
•  An improvement of at least 40%, and an absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 0 to 10 
NRS in at least 3 of the 4 following domains: 
−  PGADA 
−  Pain assessment (Total Spinal Pain, Question 1 from total and Nocturnal Spinal Pain) 
−  Physical function (measured by the BASFI) 
− 
Inflammation (represented by the mean of the BASDAI Questions 5 and 6) concerning 
morning stiffness intensity and duration) 
•  And no worsening at all in the remaining domain. 
The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the composite estimand (NRI) that combined the clinically 
meaningful improvement from Baseline in ASAS40 response at Week 16 and the IE of not discontinuing 
early from study treatment for any reason prior to Week 16. Note that only permanent discontinuations 
were considered as Ies. This definition was applicable to all analyses. 
The following 4 attributes described the composite estimand that was used to define the treatment effect 
of interest for the primary efficacy analysis: 
• Population = Study participants enrolled according to the protocol-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and randomized to IMP. 
• Study participant-level outcome = ASAS40 at Week 16. 
• Intercurrent Event (IE) handling = An IE was defined as discontinuation of study treatment prior to 
Week 16. A composite strategy was implemented in which a positive clinical outcome was defined as 
achieving ASAS40 at Week 16 and not discontinuing study treatment through Week 16. 
• Population-level summary measure = Conditional OR comparing bimekizumab to placebo. 
Intercurrent events were acknowledged as an unfavourable outcome for the composite estimand in 
considering study participants with Ies as nonresponders to the study treatment. Consequently, if the 
date of an IE (as defined in the SAP) occurred prior to or at Week 16, study participants were considered 
as nonresponders at Week 16. Additionally, missing data at Week 16 that were not preceded by an IE 
were imputed as nonresponders. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 114/230 
 
 
 
 
 
A logistic regression model was used to assess the treatment effect on ASAS40 response at Week 16. The 
model included fixed effects for treatment and stratification endpoints of MRI/CRP classification and 
region. The suitability of including these endpoints in the model was assessed using the Hosmer-
Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. If the logistic regression model was unable to converge the stratification 
factors could be dropped to facilitate the model convergence.  
The summary table results presented the number of responders, adjusted responder rates, and 
associated 95% confidence interval (CI) for bimekizumab and placebo, the adjusted OR and 95% CI for 
the comparison of bimekizumab versus placebo, and the p-value testing the null hypothesis that the 
OR=1. The treatment comparison was made using the 2-sided Wald test at a significance level of α=0.05. 
The following supportive analyses for the primary efficacy variable were conducted: 
•  Analysis on the PPS 
•  Analysis on the FAS (to be performed if the number of study participants in RS and FAS differ) 
•  Analysis using a modified composite estimand where the single identified intercurrent event is 
defined as discontinuation due to AE or lack of efficacy 
•  Analysis of individual components of the ASAS40 (using hypothetical estimand where the single 
intercurrent event is discontinuation of study treatment prior to week 16 and 
missing data and nonmissing data after the IE (reset as missing) were imputed using reference-
based MI) 
•  Analyses using treatment policy strategy for the single identified intercurrent event of 
discontinuation of study treatment prior to week 16 
•  Analysis of observed cases 
•  Tipping point analysis, including a worst-case scenario where study participants who had missing 
ACR50 response were set as nonresponders if they were randomized to bimekizumab and as 
responders if they were randomized to placebo 
•  Analysis including COVID-19 impact 
Analysis of ranked secondary endpoints  
Eleven key secondary endpoints were included in the testing hierarchy (see further below). 
The following analyses were conducted for the secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• 
For the secondary binary endpoints: 
-  Composite Estimand – NRI: The same composite estimand structure as the one defined in for the 
primary efficacy analysis was used. The same analysis model was considered, and the analysis 
results were presented similarly as for the primary efficacy analysis. The imputation strategy for 
handling missing data was the same as for the primary endpoint; i.e. the NRI approach. 
-  Modified Composite – MI: A similar modified composite estimand structure as the one defined for 
the primary efficacy analysis was used. The same analysis model was considered, and the 
analysis results were presented similarly as for the primary efficacy analysis.  
-  Observed Case analysis 
For the secondary continuous endpoints: 
-  Reference-Based Estimand – MI: The same hypothetical estimand structure as the one defined in 
for the analysis on component endpoints for the primary efficacy endpoint was used. The same

analysis model and imputation strategy for handling missing data was also considered. The 
analysis results were presented similarly as for this analysis on the individual ASAS40 
components. 
-  Hypothetical Estimand – MI where the single intercurrent event is discontinuation of study 
treatment prior to week 16 and missing data and non-missing data after the IE (reset as missing) 
were imputed under a MAR assumption 
-  Observed Case Analysis  
-  Analysis to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary analysis of all secondary 
efficacy endpoints included in the testing hierarchy were analysed on the CFS, using the 
reference-based estimand. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint ASAS40 and ASDAS-MI. In addition, ASAS40 
was analysed based on the timing of participant enrolment and timing of the Week 16 visit relative to the 
COVID-19 pandemic periods. The complete list of subgroups is listed in the table below: 
Multicentre studies 
The data from all centres were pooled for the purposes of the analysis. Centres were grouped in the 
geographic regions of North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 116/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No exploration of treatment by centre interaction was investigated. 
Type I error control 
A fixed sequence testing procedure was applied for the primary endpoint and the key secondary 
endpoints. The testing procedure accounted for multiplicity and controlled the family-wise type I error 
rate at alpha=0.05 (2-sided). 
For each test, on each binary efficacy endpoint, the null hypothesis was that the conditional odds ratio 
(OR) was equal to 1 (H0: ORT1T2 = 1). The alternative hypothesis was that the conditional OR was not 
equal to 1 (HA: ORT1T2 ≠ 1). 
For each test, on each continuous efficacy endpoint, the null hypothesis was that there was no 
difference between treatment groups (H0: T1 – T2 = 0). The alternative hypothesis was that there was a 
difference between treatment groups (HA: T1 – T2 ≠0). 
In these hypotheses, T1 referred to bimekizumab and T2 to placebo. 
According to this strategy, the statistical testing of an endpoint could be investigated only if the null 
hypothesis for the previous endpoint had been rejected (ie, if p<0.05). 
The testing order for these endpoints is shown in the figure below: 
Interim analyses 
In AS0011, two analyses are to be performed prior to the final analysis: 
•  Analysis 1: Week 24 analysis. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 117/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Analysis 2: Week 52 analysis. 
No formal alterations to the further study conduct (e.g., stopping rules, sample size re-estimation, or 
changes to eligibility criteria) were planned for the 2 interim analyses (Week 24 and Week 52). No 
separate SAP for the Week 24 analyses was to be provided. The TFL shells for the Week 24 and the Week 
52 analyses were provided in the same document and appropriately identified. The type of efficacy and 
safety analyses to be provided for the 2 interim analyses was detailed in the SAP. 
The final analysis for AS0011 will consist of a rerun of all analyses provided during the preceding interim 
analysis. This includes new SFU data that were not available for the Week 52 analysis. If there is no SFU 
data ongoing, the final analysis will be identical to the Week 52 analysis. 
Results 
Screening for AS0011 started on 25 April 2019 and completed on 21 April 2021.  
A total of 612 study participants signed the ICF and were screened for the study, 280 of whom were 
screen failures. The most common reason for screen failure was ineligibility due to not meeting one or 
more inclusion criteria. 
A total of 322 study participants were randomised in the global population and started treatment in 
AS0010. Study participants were randomised 2:1 to either bimekizumab 160mg sc Q4W (221 patients) or 
placebo sc Q4W ((111 patients). 
Most study participants completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period and were similar for both 
bimekizumab and placebo (96.4% and 98.2% respectively). The most common primary reasons for 
discontinuation during the Double-Blind Treatment Period were due to withdrawal by study participant (4 
study participants [1.2%]) and an AE (3 study participants [0.9%]). 
A full breakdown of the patient flow figures can be found in Table 47 of the CSR (see Table 47 below).

(RS) 
Conduct of the study 
Overall, the study was conducted appropriately. There have been 4 protocol amendments to date; 
however, none of these are felt to have diminished the integrity of the trial. 
The Covid-19 pandemic does not seem to have had any material impact on the conduct of the trial. 
While 4.8% of patients did experience one or more protocol deviations, for the most part these were 
minor – bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (5.0%) and placebo (4.5%) groups. Overall, the most common 
protocol deviation was prohibited concomitant medication use, with an incidence of 1.4% in the 
bimekizumab group and 2.7% in the placebo group. 
Baseline data 
Overall, baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups. There were some slight 
differences between the groups with respect to patients >45y ((37.1% and 30.6% in bimekizumab and 
placebo groups respectively). 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 119/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of study participants were White (80.4%). The mean body weight and mean BMI overall 
were 80.43kg and 26.86kg/m2, respectively. For each treatment group, the proportions of study 
participants enrolled in each region and study participants with or without prior TNFα exposure were 
similar. 
Study participants were most commonly enrolled in the following countries: Poland (26.2%), the Czech 
Republic (16.9%), China (13.3%), and Spain (10.2%). 
The Baseline disease characteristics were reflective of a study population with active AS and high burden 
of disease despite standard of care treatment. Overall, the mean times since first diagnosis and first 
symptoms of AS were 6.39 years (range: 0.1 to 41.0 years) and 13.46 years (range: 0.4 to 59.1 years), 
respectively. Most of the study participants (85.5%) were positive for HLA-B27. Treatment groups were 
generally well balanced with respect to AS-related and other Baseline disease characteristics. 
Prior anti-TNF therapy was used by 16.3% of all study participants. At Baseline, the majority of all study 
participants were using NSAID therapies (79.8%), 29.9% were on conventional synthetic DMARDs, 6.9% 
were taking oral corticosteroids, and 13.6% were on analgesic/opioid therapies.

Numbers analysed 
The RS and SS consisted of the same study participants, with 221 study participants in the bimekizumab 
group and 111 study participants in the placebo/bimekizumab group. The MS included the same study 
participants as the RS and SS, except for the 10 study participants who discontinued during the Double-
Blind Treatment Period and the 3 study participants who completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period 
but did not enter the Maintenance Period. The FAS included the same study participants as the RS and 
SS, except for 1 study participant in the bimekizumab group who was excluded from the FAS due to 
incomplete baseline PGADA assessment. Most of all study participants were included in the PPS (94.0%) 
and in the PK-PPS (99.4%).

Outcomes and estimation 
The results of the primary and key secondary efficacy variables are provided below. Overall, bimekizumab 
treatment resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences over placebo for the 
primary and all key secondary endpoints included in the predefined sequential testing sequence 
(p<0.001).

Primary efficacy endpoint – ASAS40 at Week 16 
The bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a higher ASAS40 response rate compared with the placebo 
group at Week 16 that was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (44.8% vs 22.5%, 
respectively; p<0.001). 
Table 51: ASAS40 response rates at Week 16 (RS [NRI]) 
The ASAS40 response rate for study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group further increased 
from Week 16 (44.8%) to Week 52 (58.4%). 
The bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had an improvement over placebo for each of the ASAS40 
components (shown as difference of bimekizumab-placebo): PGADA (-1.28); Total Spinal Pain (-1.43); 
BASFI score (function) (-1.05); and BASDAI Q5/Q6 mean score (inflammation) (-1.13). and all other 
sensitivity analyses.

Table 52: Change from Baseline in individual components of ASAS40 response at Week 16 (RS 
[reference-based MI]) 
The supportive analyses of the primary endpoint were consistent with the results of the primary analysis. 
When ASAS40 response rates were analysed with alternative methods for handling missing data (MI, 
Treatment Policy Strategy, OC, or the Tipping Point Analysis), or with additional analysis sets (PPS, FAS, 
and COVID-19 Free Set), the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had higher ASAS40 response rates 
compared with the placebo group (nominal p<0.001 for all comparisons). Additionally, there was no 
evidence that the timing of the Week 16 Visit relative to the COVID-19 pandemic had an effect on 
ASAS40 response rates for bimekizumab and placebo. 
Subgroup analysis 
Overall, a consistent trend of increased ASAS40 response rates in the bimekizumab group compared with 
the placebo group was evident across all subgroups, except for the subgroup of participants with a BMI of 
≥30kg/m2 (see Figure 33 below). 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 127/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In participants <45 years of age, the ASAS40 response rate at Week 16 in the bimekizumab group 
(53.2%) was higher compared with placebo (22.1%), while in participants ≥45 years of age, the ASAS40 
response rate was lower than in participants <45 years of age. In this older age category, the ASAS40 
response rate was slightly higher in the bimekizumab group (30.5%) compared with the placebo groups 
(23.5%). 
In participants with a BMI ≥18.5 to 25kg/m2, the ASAS40 response rate in the bimekizumab group 
(47.8%) was higher compared with placebo (17.5%), which was similar in in participants with a BMI of 
≥25 to <30kg/m2 where the ASAS40 response rate was higher in the bimekizumab group (57.4%) 
compared with the placebo group (18.4%). In participants with a BMI of ≥30kg/m2, the ASAS40 
response rate in the bimekizumab group (27.6%) was lower than in participants with a BMI ≥18.5 to 
25kg/m2 or ≥25 to <30kg/m2 and similar to the placebo group (30.0%). 
In male participants, the ASAS40 response rate at Week 16 in the bimekizumab group (46.3%) was 
higher compared with placebo (21.3%), while in female participants, the ASAS40 response rate was 
slightly lower than in male participants but was higher in the bimekizumab group (41.0%) compared with 
the placebo group (25.8%). 
In participants with prior TNFα inhibitor exposure, the ASAS40 response rate at Week 16 in the 
bimekizumab group (40.5%) was higher compared with placebo (17.6%). Results were similar in 
participants with no prior TNFα inhibitor exposure, where the ASAS40 response was higher in the 
bimekizumab group (45.7%) compared with the placebo group (23.4%). However, the sample size for 
study participants with prior TNFα inhibitor exposure was small, and conclusions should be drawn with 
caution. 
For the region subgroups, the bimekizumab group had higher ASAS40 response rates compared with 
placebo in participants from Eastern Europe (54.6% vs 21.8%, respectively), Asia (42.5% vs 23.8%, 
respectively), and a slightly higher ASAS40 response rate in Western Europe and North America (31.5% 
vs 22.9%, respectively). In the bimekizumab group, the ASAS40 response rate was higher in Eastern 
Europe (54.6%) compared with Asia (42.5%), which was also higher compared with Western Europe and 
North America (31.5%).

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Bimekizumab treatment resulted in statistically significant improvements over placebo for all key 
secondary endpoints included in the predefined sequential testing sequence (p-values were p≤0.005; 
ASAS40 in TNFα inhibitor naïve participants, ASAS20, BASDAI, ASAS-PR, ASDAS-MI, ASAS5/6, BASFI, 
Nocturnal Spinal Pain, ASQoL, SF-36 PCS score, and BASMI), which resulted in meaningful improvement 
after bimekizumab treatment (see Table 50). Additionally, improvements after bimekizumab treatment 
over placebo were observed for MASES and enthesitis-free state, see below.

Table 54: Enthesitis-free state based on the MASES index at Week 16 (RS [NRI]) 
The results of the supportive analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints were in line with the results of 
the primary analyses of these endpoints. 
Upon CHMP’s request, data at week 52 were presented by the MAH. The ASAS40 response rate in anti-
TNF alpha naïve patients further increased from week 16 (45.7%) to week 52 (58.7%) for participants in 
the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. The ASAS20 response rate further increased slightly from Week 16 
(66.1%) to Week 52 (71.5%) in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. The ASAS-PR response rates 
further increased slightly from Week 16 (24.0%) to Week 52 (29.9%) for participants in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group. The ASDAS-MI response rates further increased from Week 16 (25.8%) to Week 52 
(32.1%) for participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
The change from Baseline in mean NSP Score further decreased from Week 16 (-3.3) to Week 52 (-4.1) 
for participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
The change from Baseline in BASMI score further decreased from Week 16 (-0.4774) to Week 52 (-
0.7213) for study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
The mean change from Baseline in BASDAI total score further decreased from Week 16 (-2.90) to Week 
52 (-3.58) for participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
The change from Baseline in MASES index score for participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
further decreased from Week 16 (-2.37) to Week 24 (-2.84) and was sustained to Week 52 (-2.88). The 
proportion of participants who reached an enthesitis-free state was similar at Week 16 (51.5%) and Week 
52 (50.8%) for study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
The below other secondary endpoints were considered as clinically relevant.

BASDAI50 response 
The BASDAI50 response rate for study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group increased up 
to Week 16, and the BASDAI50 response rate was greater in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
(46.6%) compared with the placebo group (26.1%) at Week 16 (Table 58). The BASDAI50 response rates 
further increased from Week 16 (46.6%) to Week 52 (53.8%) for study participants in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group. 
In participants who switched from placebo to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, the BASDAI50 response rate 
markedly increased from Week 16 (26.1%) to Week 52 (62.2%) (Table 58).

Change from Baseline in hs-CRP 
The geometric mean hs-CRP ratio (decreases reflect improvement) was lower in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W group (0.376) compared with the placebo group at week 2 (0.893) (LS means difference 95% CI: -
9.29 to -4.91; nominal p<0.001) (Table 59). 
In the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, the geometric mean hs-CRP ratios were similar from Week 2 
(0.376) to Week 16 (0.365). In the placebo group, the geometric mean hs-CRP ratios were similar from 
Week 2 (0.893) to Week 16 (0.893). At Week 16, hs-CRP ratios remained lower in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group (0.365) compared with the placebo group (0.893) (Table 59). 
The geometric mean hs-CRP ratios were similar at Week 16 (0.365) and Week 52 (0.333) for study 
participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
In participants who switched from placebo to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, geometric mean hs-CRP ratios 
markedly decreased from Week 16 (0.893) to Week 24 (0.283) and were sustained to Week 52 (0.298) 
(Table 59).

Patients treated with bimekizumab reported meaningful reduction in fatigue as assessed by the FACIT-
Fatigue score (Mean change from baseline at Week 16: 8.4for bimekizumab versus 5.0 for placebo.  
In pooled data from BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA) and BE MOBILE 2 (AS), at Week 16, the proportion of 
patients developing a uveitis event was lower with bimekizumab (0.6%) compared to placebo (4.6%). 
The incidence of uveitis remained low with long-term treatment with bimekizumab (1.2/100 patient-years 
in the pooled phase 2/3 studies).

Supportive studies 
AS0014 
AS0014 is an ongoing Phase 3 open-label extension study including patients from AS0010 and AS0011, 
designed to assesses the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab in both AS and nr-
axSpA. A summary of the study is presented below. 
The results from the open-label extension trial, AS0014 did not have an impact on the assessment of the 
clinical efficacy data. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Bimekizumab is currently approved for plaque psoriasis (PSO). This application aims to extend the 
indication to treatment of active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including both radiographic (raxSpA) and 
non-radiographic disease (nr-axSpA). According to the proposed SmPC, the recommended posology is 
160 mg (given as 1 subcutaneous injection) every 4 weeks.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Bimekizumab was investigated in the dose finding study AS0008 and the associated OLE study AS0009. 
Main efficacy studies were the 1-year phase III studies AS0010 and AS0011.  
AS0008 was a phase 2b, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 48 
week dose-ranging study to investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of bimekizumab compared with placebo in adult subjects with active ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) in order to guide the selection of doses and clinical indices in the Phase 3 development 
program. 
Eligible subjects had to have active AS, determined by documented radiologic evidence (X-ray) fulfilling 
the Modified New York criteria for AS (1984), including symptoms for ≥3 months and age of onset <45. 
Furthermore, subjects will have moderate to severe active disease (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease 
Activity Index [BASDAI] ≥4 and spinal pain ≥4 [BASDAI Question 2]). Subjects must have at least 1 of 
the following: 1) inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, 2) 
intolerance to administration of at least 1 NSAID, or 3) contraindication(s) to NSAID therapy. 
The primary objective was to assess the dose-response based on the efficacy of bimekizumab 
administered subcutaneously (sc) Q4W for 12 weeks in the treatment of subjects with active AS. The 
primary efficacy variable was the Assessment in Axial SpondyloArthritis International Society 40% 
response criteria (ASAS40) response at Week 12. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio for the 
following treatment regimens in the double blind treatment period: PBO or BKZ 16 mg, 64 mg, 160 mg or 
320 mg Q4W. After week 12, study participants who were in the PBO, BKZ 16 mg and BKZ 64 mg groups 
were randomised 1:1 to BKZ 160 mg or 320 mg, patients originally randomised in the BKZ 160 mg or 
320 mg groups remained on their initially assigned treatment.  
Study participants who completed the 48-week AS0008 study were eligible to enter the open label 
extension study AS0009 which has a 4-year duration, investigating long term safety, tolerability and 
efficacy of bimekizumab.  
AS0010 was a 52-week multicenter, Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in subjects with active nonradiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA).  
To be eligible to participate in this study, study participants must have had active adult-onset nr-axSpA 
(BASDAI ≥4 and spinal pain ≥4 on a 0 to 10 NRS meeting ASAS classification criteria, with inflammatory 
back pain for at least 3 months prior to the Screening Visit and an age at symptom onset of <45 years. 
Study participants must have had objective inflammation, defined by sacroiliitis on the Screening MRI 
according to ASAS/OMERACT scoring and/or elevated CRP. Study participants must not have had 
radiographic sacroiliitis as defined by mNY criteria. 
The primary objective of AS0010 was to demonstrate the efficacy of bimekizumab administered 
subcutaneously (sc) every 4 weeks (Q4W) compared with placebo in the treatment of subjects with active 
nr-axSpA. The primary efficacy variable for this study was ASAS40 response at Week 16. This endpoint is 
in concordance with the EMA guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the 
Treatment of Axial Spondyloarthritis. A series of secondary endpoints (all week 16) were investigated 
through a hierarchical testing strategy to account for multiplicity. While a rationale for the order of 
endpoints in the testing hierarchy was not provided, the CHMP considers that all the secondary enpoints 
are justifiable from a clinical perspective. Following week 16, all PBO patients were switched to active 
treatment.  
AS0011 was a 52-week multicenter, Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in subjects with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a 
EMA/235041/2023

subtype of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with radiographic evidence of disease (also known as 
radiographic axSpA [r-axSpA]). 
To be eligible to participate in this study, study participants must have been adults with AS as per the 
mNY criteria (1984) including documented radiologic evidence (x-ray) based on central reading and at 
least 3 months of symptoms with age at symptom onset <45 years. In addition, study participants must 
have had moderate to severe active disease as defined by both BASDAI ≥4 AND spinal pain ≥4 on a 0 to 
10 numeric rating scale (NRS) (from BASDAI Item 2). 
The primary objective of AS0011 was to demonstrate the efficacy of bimekizumab administered 
subcutaneously (sc) every 4 weeks (Q4W) compared with placebo in the treatment of subjects with active 
AS. The primary efficacy variable for this study is the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International 
Society 40% response criteria (ASAS 40) response at Week 16. This endpoint is in concordance with the 
current EMA guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Axial 
Spondyloarthritis. A series of secondary endpoints (all week 16) were investigated through a hierarchical 
testing strategy to account for multiplicity. While a rationale for the order of endpoints in the testing 
hierarchy was not provided, the CHMP considers that all the secondary enpoints are justifiable from a 
clinical perspective. Following week 16, all PBO patients were switched to active treatment. 
These primary and secondary endpoints are in line with EMA guidance on the clinical investigation of 
medicinal products for the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In dose finding study AS0008, across the bimekizumab (BKZ) doses included in the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test, a statistically significant dose response was observed in ASAS40 responder rates at Week 
12 (p<0.001). According to the MAH, this dose response was linear at bimekizumab doses up to 160mg, 
with ASAS40 responder rates at Week 12 ranging from 29.5% (bimekizumab 16mg) to 46.7% 
(bimekizumab 160mg), and 13.3% for PBO. However, from the clinical efficacy data presented in study 
AS0008 it appeared that the overall 64 mg Q4W response was already very comparable to the 160 mg 
Q4W response at week 12. In study AS0008, the outcome primary analysis of the primary endpoint was 
supported by the results of the secondary analyses and sensitivity analyses. In addition, the results of all 
5 secondary endpoints were consistent and in favour of BKZ treatment thus supporting the primary 
endpoint findings.  
The 160 mg Q4W and 320 mg Q4W responses were maintained and increased even further up to week 
48. Unfortunately, no 48-week analysis was foreseen for the 64 mg Q4W dosing and in the subsequent 
phase 3 studies, only the 160 mg Q4W dose was further investigated. Further, in the phase 3 studies, the 
primary endpoint was analysed at week 16 instead of week 12. Nevertheless, the following proposed dose 
recommendation was considered acceptable by the CHMP: 160 mg (given as 1 subcutaneous injection) 
every 4 weeks. 
Interim data up to week 104 from study AS0009, i.e. 3 year after start of therapy/PBO, suggested the 
BKZ treatment response was stable and remained high over time. Confirmation however was needed 
from long term phase 3 study data, this is further discussed below.  
In phase III study AS0010, 254 patients were randomised. Study participant demographics and baseline 
characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups. Median time since first diagnosis of axSpa 
was less than 2 years. Only about 10% of patients had used biological anti TNF treatment in the past, and 
about 75% of patients were using NSAID at the start of the study.  
The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were evaluated using a fixed-sequence testing 
procedure to account for multiplicity. Bimekizumab treatment resulted in statistically significant and 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 145/230 
 
 
 
 
 
clinically meaningful differences over placebo for the primary endpoint (ASAS40 response at week 16, 
BKZ 47.7% vs PBO 21.4%) and in all week 16, key secondary endpoints of the predefined sequential 
testing sequence (p<0.001), demonstrating significant and clinically relevant effects on different 
components and symptoms of active non-radiographic axSpa. Secondary endpoints included assessments 
of BASDAI score, nocturnal spinal pain, ASQOL, SF-36 and enthesitis-free state.  
Subgroup analysis showed that treatment response differences were observed according to age, gender 
and BMI. For the ASAS40 endpoint at week 16, treatment response was 60% in under 45 years and 24% 
in those 45 year and older; treatment response was 58% in males compared to 34% in females. In those 
patients presenting with a BMI of 30 or more, treatment response was only 28%.  
Response to therapy (e.g ASAS40) was maintained up to week 52, with 78 of 128 patients (60.9%) who 
received 160mg Q4W having a positive outcome on ASAS40 assessment.  
In phase III study AS0011, 332 patients were randomised. Demographics and baseline characteristics 
were well balanced between treatment groups except for a slight imbalance of study participants ≥45 
years which had no significant effect on the clinical outcome of the study. Median time to diagnosis was 
3.6 years, i.e. two years more than in study AS0010, which is considered logical because of the different 
patient population. In study AS0011, patients had to have radiographic evidence of disease in contrast to 
study AS0010 participants. 16% of patients had used prior anti-TNF therapy, and 80% was using NSAIDs 
at the start of the study.  
The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were evaluated using a fixed-sequence testing 
procedure to account for multiplicity. Bimekizumab treatment resulted in statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful differences over placebo for the primary endpoint (ASAS40 response at week 16, 
BKZ 44.8% vs PBO 22.5%) and all 16-week key secondary endpoints included in the predefined 
sequential testing sequence, demonstrating significant and clinically relevant effects on different 
components and symptoms of active ankylosing spondylitis. Secondary endpoints included assessments 
of BASDAI score, nocturnal spinal pain, ASQOL, SF-36 and enthesitis-free state. 
Subgroup analysis showed that treatment response differences were observed according to age and BMI, 
but not gender. For ASAS40 at week 16, treatment response was 49% in under 45 years and 29% in 
those 45 year and older; treatment response was 43% in males compared to 38% in females. In those 
patients presenting with a BMI of 30 or more, treatment response was only 26%. 
Response to therapy (e.g. ASAS40) was maintained up to week 52 with 129 of 221 patients (58.4%) who 
received 160mg Q4W having a positive outcome on ASAS40 assessment.  
Considering that in both study AS0010 and AS0011 large and potentially clinically relevant treatment 
effect differences were observed in subgroups based on age (younger than 45 years or 45 years and 
older) and based on BMI (BMI over 30 compared to BMI under 30), the MAH was requested to discuss 
whether these treatment effect differences should be highlighted in the SmPC as they can be considered 
of relevance to the prescriber. Overall, bimekizumab treatment showed a consistent trend towards 
greater clinical efficacy than placebo across subgroups in the full spectrum of axSpA; this is 
acknowledged. With regard to age, in pool EA1, the ASAS40 response at Week 16 was 54.5% vs 24.0%, 
respectively, for study participants <45 years old and 28.4% vs 17.1%, respectively, for study 
participants ≥45 years old (BKZ vs PBO). Although the treatment effect was more pronounced in the 
younger participants (<45 years old), there was no evidence of an interaction between age and treatment 
according to the MAH. In addition, pooled efficacy data at Week 52 (Pool EA2) indicate that in both age 
subgroup categories, the response rate improves substantially in the older study participants during the 
Maintenance Period up to 65.2% for participants <45 years old vs 47.4% for participants ≥45 years old. 
With regard to BMI, the MAH provided support for the use of bimekizumab 160mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) 
in higher-weight (≥120kg) patients in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). While it is acknowledged that 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 146/230 
 
 
 
 
 
exposure is lower in higher-weight study participants, a dose of bimekizumab 160mg Q4W is at or near 
the plateau of the dose-response relationship, and weight-driven differences in exposure are not 
predicted to translate into clinically meaningful changes in the ASAS response rates. AxSpA clinical 
studies in the bimekizumab program showed that the observed ASAS40 response rate for higher-weight 
study participants (>100kg) approached that of the overall population. This is agreed. Update of SmPC 
was not considered warranted by the CHMP. 
Receipt of rescue and/or prohibited medication was not identified as an intercurrent event and thus was 
implicitly handled using a treatment policy strategy. The MAH presented additional analyses of the 
primary endpoint in studies AS0010 and AS0011 in which receipt of rescue and/or prohibited medication 
was treated as a second intercurrent event to be handled using the same strategy as discontinuation of 
study treatment, i.e. using a composite strategy. This had no impact on the study conclusions. 
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH provided results from the open-label extension trial, AS0014; these did 
not have an impact on the assessment of the clinical efficacy data. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the phase 3 studies AS0010 and AS0011, bimekizumab 160 mg Q4W resulted in a highly significant 
and clinically relevant ASAS40 response at week 16 (primary endpoint). In both trials, the primary 
endpoint result was corroborated by the outcomes of the secondary endpoints which included 
assessments of BASDAI score, nocturnal spinal pain, ASQOL, SF-36 and enthesitis-free state. Based on 
the clinical efficacy data provided, it can be concluded that bimekizumab has a beneficial effect on the 
symptoms and progression of non-radiographic axSpa and AS. The main analyses were done at 16 weeks 
of treatment, with evidence in phase 3 trials that efficacy is maintained up to week 52. The proposed 
dosing regimen of 160 mg (given as 1 subcutaneous injection) every 4 weeks was also supported by the 
CHMP.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
For the currently approved plaque psoriasis indication, the most notable identified safety concern related 
to infections, the majority of which were upper respiratory and mucocutaneous candida and tinea 
infections. These were for the main part resolvable and did not impact on treatment compliance. The 
incidence rate of serious infections in bimekizumab-treated study participants was low. No particular 
patterns of serious infection were identified. Similar to other IL_17 inhibitors, clinically active important 
infections were included as a contraindication. Warnings were included in section 4.4 regarding use in 
patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, IBD, hypersensitivity reactions, need 
for pre-treatment evaluation for TB and vaccinations. For the serious identified risk of serious infections 
and the serious potential risks of hypersensitivity, malignancies, IBD and MACE, an open-label, long-term 
study in adult study participants with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque PSO is ongoing (PS0014) to 
detect late developing ADRs, increased incidences to an already increased background rate of 
comorbidities and low-frequency adverse drug reactions. A bimekizumab real-world outcomes study is 
ongoing for long-term surveillance in larger and real-world patient populations with PSO.  
The spondyloarthritis program included two pivotal phase 3 studies and one phase 3 open label extension 
study. Phase 2 studies were conducted in participants with AS and not in participants with nr-axSpA. 
Phase 3 studies included participants with nr-axSpA or AS to address the efficacy and safety profile in 
both subpopulations (AS0010 and AS0011, respectively, and their OLE AS0014).

Safety evaluation 
The safety evaluation for bimekizumab mainly utilised 3 pools (see Table 62 below): 
• 
• 
• 
Pool SA1 is the primary safety pool used to summarise the safety of bimekizumab vs placebo 
treatment in axSpA through Week 16 in Phase 3 studies AS0010 and AS0011. 
Pool SA2 provides the most comprehensive overview of safety in axSpA by including all Phase 2 
and Phase 3 data from nr-axSpA and AS studies. 
Pool S3 provides an overview of safety across the BKZ development program. 
Safety data from study participants with nr-axSpA or AS were combined for the purpose of the integrated 
pooled safety analyses. Combining the 2 subpopulations allowed to increase the sample size and was 
medically relevant by the MAH considering that nr-axSpA and AS belong to the same disease spectrum of 
axial spondyloarthritis. Selected summaries were also repeated by nr-axSpA and AS subpopulations. 
Table 62: Overview of safety pools 
Patient exposure 
T patient exposure to bimekizumab is estimated as approximately 588 patient-years cumulatively from 01 
August 2021 to 31 January 2022. 
As per PSUR (19 february2022) overall, 6875 study participants have received an investigational 
medicinal product during the bimekizumab development program since the Development International 
Birth Date (DIBD) up to the DLP. Out of this, a total of 5401 study participants were exposed to 
bimekizumab in ongoing unblinded, ongoing open-label and completed studies.

A total of 928 adult study participants with active axSpA have received bimekizumab during the axSpA 
development program. 
Pool SA1 consisted of a total of 586 study participants; 349 participants (128 participants with nr-axSpA 
[AS0010] and 221 with AS [AS0011]) were exposed to bimekizumab and 237 participants (126 with nr-
axSpA [AS0010] and 111 with AS [AS0011]) were exposed to placebo, with the total times at risk 
accounting for 108.6 participant-years in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 73.0 participant-years 
in the placebo group. 
Pool SA2 consisted of a total of 928 study participants; 574 participants with nr-axSpA (244 participants) 
or AS (330 participants) from the Phase 3 program of which 351 participants had entered the OLE 
AS0014 at the cut-off date, and 354 participants with AS from the Phase 2 program (303 participants 
from AS0008 of which 255 had entered the OLE AS0009 at the cut-of date, and 51 participants from 
AS0013), with 588 study participants in the bimekizumab Total group exposed to bimekizumab for at 
least 12 months, and a total time at risk accounting for 1907.5 participant-years. 
Phase 2 studies (AS0008, AS0009, and AS0013) were all conducted in study participants with active AS, 
while Phase 3 studies were conducted in participants with active AS (AS0011 and AS0014) and nr-axSpA 
(AS0010 and AS0014). The total study medication duration in Phase 3 was 284.3 and 441.4 participant-
years for participants with nr-axSpA and AS, respectively, and the total time at risk was 292.6 and 454.3 
participant-years for participants with nr-axSpA and AS, respectively.

Demographics 
Demographic and Baseline characteristic variables are presented by treatment group for Pool SA1 and 
Pool SA2. 
Pool SA1 
The mean age of study participants was 39.5 years (range: 18 to 79 years), with most of the study 
participants (68.3%) in the age category <45 years of age. The proportion of participants aged 65 to <85 
years of age was small (2.9%) and no participants were ≥85 years of age.  
There were more male than female participants (64.5% vs 35.5%), which is in line with the higher 
prevalence of AS in men than in women.

Baseline characteristics were comparable between Pool SA1 and Pool SA2. 
Table 70 from the integrated summary of safety demonstrates the characteristics of participants in 
studies included in SA2. The demographic and baseline characteristics with a differences >5% between 
the groups were: 
•  A higher proportion of Eastern European participants in Phase 2/3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
(64.0%) as compared to Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (52.4%) group. 
•  A higher proportion of Asian participants in Phase 3 studies than in Phase 2/3 studies (14.6% vs 
9.9%) and a lower proportion of White participants in Phase 3 studies than in Phase 2/3 studies 
(82.9% vs 88.0%) due to the participation of Asian clinical study sites in Phase 3 studies. 
•  A higher proportion of women in Phase 3 than in Phase 2/3 studies (35.2% vs 28.5%) resulting from 
the nr-axSpA study AS0010 in Phase 3 (while all Phase 2 studies were in the AS population) and a 
higher prevalence of AS in men than in women and a balanced prevalence of nr-axSpA between men 
and women.

Adverse events 
Pool SA1 
Pool SA1 is the primary safety pool used to summarise the safety of bimekizumab compared with placebo 
through Week 16 of the Double-Blind Treatment Period in Phase 3 studies AS0010 and AS0011. 
TEAEs were reported at a higher incidence in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the 
placebo group (57.3% vs 50.2%). The incidence of serious TEAEs was low overall and similar in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (1.1%) compared with the placebo group (0.8%). 
The incidence of study discontinuations due to TEAEs was low overall and similar in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group (2.3%) compared with the placebo group (2.1%). 
Drug-related TEAEs (as assessed by the Investigator) were reported at a higher incidence in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group (27.8% vs 15.6%). 
There were no deaths reported in Pool SA1.

Table 71: Overview of TEAEs during the Initial Treatment Period (Pool SA1) 
Pool SA2 
Pool SA2 provided the most comprehensive overview of safety in axSpA by including all Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 data from nr-axSpA and AS studies. This included TEAEs during the combined Initial, 
Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Periods. 
In Pool SA2, the majority of study participants in the bimekizumab Total group (85.6%; EAIR: 
155.6/100 participant-years) reported a TEAE.  
Almost half of study participants (45.4%; EAIR: 33.7/100 participant-years) had TEAEs that were 
considered drug-related. 
At the time of the safety update (52-week data) there was one further death reported meaning that there 
were 3 deaths, in total reported in Pool SA2; all occurred in the Phase 2 program.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
At the time of the safety update, a total of 3 bimekizumab-treated study participants experienced a TEAE 
with fatal outcome in the bimekizumab development program for axSpA. Both deaths occurred in the 
phase 2 studies AS0008 and AS0009 and were not considered related to the IMP. 
In the updated safety data, there was one further death reported in study AS009. This event was 
assessed as unrelated to bimekizumab. 
Serious SAEs 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, incidences of serious TEAEs were low and similar in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
(1.1%) and in the placebo group (0.8%) during the Initial Treatment Period. By PT, all serious TEAEs by 
PT were reported by 1 study participant in any treatment group.

Table 73: Incidence of serious TEAEs per 100 participant-years by SOC and PT during the 
Initial Treatment Period (Pool SA1) 
Pool SA2 
During the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period, the incidence of serious TEAEs was 
10.8% (EAIR=5.6/100 participant-years [95% CI: 4.6, 6.8]) of study participants in the bimekizumab 
Total group. Serious TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the SOCs of 
Infections and infestations (3.0%), Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (1.5%), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (1.4%). 
Treatment-emergent serious TEAEs reported in at least 3 study participants by PT in Pool SA2 during the

Severe TEAEs 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, during the Initial Treatment Period, the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity 
in both treatment groups. The incidence of severe TEAEs was low overall and similar between the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (0.9%) and placebo group (0.4%) group. No severe TEAEs, by PT, were 
reported by >1 study participant. None of the severe TEAEs led to discontinuation.

Table 75: Incidence of Severe TEAEs per 100 subject-years during the Initial Treatment Period 
Analysis Set: Pool SA1 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, the incidence of severe TEAEs was low overall. A total of 7.1% of study participants in the 
bimekizumab Total group reported severe TEAEs during the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE 
Treatment Period. Severe TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the 
SOC of Infections and infestations (1.6%). Most severe TEAE were isolated cases. A total of 11 severe 
TEAEs were reported more than once in the bimekizumab Total group. These TEAEs include colitis 
ulcerative, toothache, diarrhoea, cholelithiasis, erysipelas, meniscus injury, humerus fracture, syncope, 
EMA/235041/2023

and suicidal ideation, each accounting for 0.2% of the study participants, and osteoarthritis accounting 
for 0.3% of the study participants. 
When adjusting for exposure for severe TEAEs in the Phase 3 bimekizumab group in Pool SA2 (EAIR: 
4.0/100 participant-years [95% CI: 2.7, 5.7]), there was a small numerical increase (with overlapping 
CI) in incidence rate with longer exposure compared to Pool SA1 (EAIR: 2.8/100 participant-years [95% 
CI: 0.6, 8.1]). 
At the time of the safety update, when adjusting for exposure, the EAIRs of severe TEAEs in the 
bimekizumab Total group were slightly lower (3.4/100 participant-years) compared with the original 
submission (3.6/100 participant-years). 
For Pool SA2, severe TEAEs in ≥1 study participant by PT in the Phase 3 bimekizumab treatment group 
during the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Periods are provided in the following Table 
76.

Trends in the types of SAEs reported were GI disorders, infections, musculoskeletal disorders and injury, 
poisoning or procedural complications. 
Common AEs 
Common TEAEs are defined as those TEAEs occurring in ≥2% of study participants in any treatment 
group for the pool being summarised. 
Pool SA1 
Treatment-emergent AEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections and infestations for 
both the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and the placebo groups (30.4% and 23.6%, respectively). The 
incidences of nasopharyngitis were higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the 
placebo group (8.3% vs 4.2%, respectively). Rates of oral candidiasis were higher in the bimekizumab 
group (3.7% vs 0 participant). The incidences of uveitis and upper respiratory tract infection were lower 
in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group (0.6% vs 3.4%).

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Potential Hy’s Law was the only AESI defined for the axSpA program. Potential Hy’s Law, defined as ≥3x 
ULN ALT or AST with coexisting ≥2xULN total bilirubin in the absence of ≥2xULN alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), with no alternative explanation for the biochemical Abnormality. 
A review of hepatic TEAEs in Pool SA1 and Pool SA2 was performed using the MedDRA SMQ ‘Drug related 
hepatic disorder’ (excluding sub-SMQs ‘Liver neoplasms, benign [incl cysts and polyps’”and ‘Liver 
neoplasms, malignant and unspecified’). 
Pool SA1 
In pool SA1 one case met Hy’s Law laboratory criteria but was not a confirmed as a Hy’s Law case due to 
a clinical and serological diagnosis of viral hepatitis A infection. 
The incidences of hepatic TEAEs were 4.9% in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 3.0% in the 
placebo group. Hepatic TEAEs reported in >1 study participant in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
were aspartate aminotransferase increased (1.7%), alanine aminotransferase increased, transaminases 
increased (1.4% each), hepatic steatosis (1.1%), and liver function test increased (0.6%).

Table 81: Treatment-emergent elevated and markedly abnormal liver function during the 
Initial Treatment Period (Pool SA1) 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, the incidence of any hepatic TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group was 12.4% (EAIR: 
6.7/100 participant-years). When adjusted for exposure, no increased incidence rate of a hepatic TEAEs 
was observed in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group from Pool SA2 (EAIR: 7.2/100 participant-
years) when compared with the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group from Pool SA1 (EAIR: 16.2/100 
participant-years). 
Of the 115 study participants in the bimekizumab Total group with hepatic TEAEs, 1 participant had a 
serious event of hepatotoxicity, 5 participants had 7 TEAEs leading to study discontinuation (including 
protocol mandated withdrawal as per PDILI criteria), 52 participants had 128 TEAEs considered drug 
related, and 2 participants had 2 severe TEAEs (alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate 
aminotransferase increased).

Serious event of hepatotoxicity 
This event relates to a 35-year-old male participant . Medical history was significant for dyslipidemia and 
obesity. LFTs >2x ULN at baseline and hepatoprotection was given. Bloods at day 801 revealed ALP 77 
(normal), ALT 277 (5xULN), AST 213 (6.3xULN), TBil 31.3 (1.5xULN) and GGT 683 (10.7xULN). The 
participant was asymptomatic, and US showed diffuse liver changes in the form of fatty hepatosis and a 
diagnosis of hepatic steatosis. The participant was withdrawn from the study and abnormal enzymes are 
resolving with AST/ALT are 2xULN 150 days after last bimekizumab dose.

Other safety topics of interest 
Infections 
Interleukin-17A and IL-17F play a role in muco-epidermal immunity by protecting against a variety of 
pathogens, and inhibition of IL-17 may increase susceptibility of infection during the period of exposure, 
especially to Candida species. In the bimekizumab axSpA development program, in line with observations 
in the pivotal studies of the psoriasis development program, infections were the most frequently reported 
TEAEs. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 178/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported infections in the axSpA development program were nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, and oral candidiasis. When adjusted for exposure, no increased incidence rate 
of infections TEAEs was observed in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group from Pool SA2 (EAIR: 
68.3/100 participant-years) when compared with the Pool SA1 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (EAIR: 
119.4/100 participant-years). 
Infections are further broken down into serious infections, opportunistic infections and fungal infections. 
Serious infections: 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, incidences of serious infection TEAEs were similar in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
(0.3%; EAIR: 0.9/100 participant-years) and in the placebo group (0.4%; EAIR: 1.4/100 participant-
years). 
Table 83: Incidence of Serious Infection TEAEs per 100 subject-years during the Initial 
Treatment Period Analysis Set: Pool SA1 
One study participant in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law 
(ALT or AST ≥3xULN and total bilirubin ≥2xULN in the absence of ALP ≥2xULN) and was clinically and 
serologically diagnosed with Hepatitis A. The participant contracted hepatitis A from contaminated food. 
The study drug was temporarily discontinued and once restarted there was no further elevation in hepatic 
enzymes. 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, the incidence of serious infections in the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment 
Period was low overall (3.3%; EAIR: 1.5/100 participant-years) in the updated safety data for the 
bimekizumab Total group. When adjusted for exposure, a similar incidence rate was observed in the 
Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group from Pool SA2 (EAIR: 1.5/100 participant-years) when 
compared with the Pool SA1 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (EAIR: 0.9/100 participant years). The 
EAIR of serious infection TEAEs was similar in the Safety Update (1.4/100 participant-years). 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 179/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 28 study participants with serious infections, 9 had drug-related serious infections as assessed by 
the Investigator and 9 had serious infections that were reported as severe in intensity. Study drug was 
withdrawn in 3 participants who discontinued due to a serious infection TEAE (perirectal abscess, 
cellulitis, and pneumonia). 
Overall, 27 of the 34 serious infections (79.4%) in the bimekizumab Total group were reported as 
resolved. Two participants had a total of 3 events (abscess limb and erysipelas in 1 participant and 
corona virus infection in the other) that recovered with sequelae. Three serious infections (corona virus 
infection, otitis media, fungal oesophagitis) were reported as not resolved at the time of the data cut. One 
serious infection of cellulitis (2.9%) was reported as resolving.  
In the Safety Update, a total of 3 additional serious infections (appendicitis, perirectal abscess, and 
diverticulitis) were reported; 2 TEAEs (appendicitis and perirectal abscess) were considered severe, 1 
TEAE (diverticulitis) was considered related to study medication, and all 3 TEAEs were resolved.

Opportunistic infections: 
Pool SA1 
One study participant in AS0014 had a TEAE of fungal oesophagitis that was entered after the final DLP 
for UCB assessment as an opportunistic infection. Upon CHMP’s request, it was clarified that the case had

In Pool SA2, the incidence of any localised opportunistic infection in the combined Initial, Maintenance, 
and OLE Treatment Period was low overall in the bimekizumab Total group (1.1%; EAIR: 0.5/100 
participant-years). Except for 1 case of herpes zoster, all opportunistic infections were localised 
mucocutaneous fungal infections. 
In the updated safety data the incidence of any localised opportunistic infection was 1.3% in the 
bimekizumab Total group in the Safety Update; the EAIR in the Safety Update was consistent with the 
original submission (0.5/100 participant-years each) which is also consistent with the initial submission. 
Opportunistic infections PTs reported in Pool SA2 in the bimekizumab Total group were oropharyngeal 
candidiasis (0.6%), oesophageal candidiasis, fungal oesophagitis, oropharyngitis fungal, and herpes 
zoster (0.1%, each). 
Two participants discontinued the study due to an opportunistic infection (herpes zoster and oesophageal 
candidiasis).

Fungal infections: 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, the incidence of any fungal infection in the Initial Treatment Period was higher in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (6.3%; EAIR: 20.8/100 participant-years) compared with the placebo group 
(none reported). Oral candidiasis was the most frequently reported (3.7%) PT, followed by vulvovaginal 
mycotic infection (1.7%). All other PTs were reported in <1% of study participants. Of the 28 fungal 
infections reported (in 22 study participants), 25 were reported as resolved at the time of the DLP.

Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, the incidence of any fungal infection during the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE 
Treatment Period in the bimekizumab Total group was 18.6% (EAIR: 10.7/100 participant years). By PT, 
oral candidiasis (8.1%), oral fungal infection (3.2%), and fungal skin infection (3.1%) were reported with 
an incidence ≥2% in the bimekizumab Total group. At the DLP 14 participants were classified as 
‘recovering/resolving’ and 25 were classified as ‘not recovered/not resolved’. 
In the Safety Update, the incidence of any fungal infection TEAE was 20.3% in the bimekizumab Total 
group; the EAIR was lower in the Safety Update (9.9/100 participant-years) compared with the original 
submission (10.7/100 participant-years), indicating no increased risk with longer exposure to 
bimekizumab.

TB 
No study participant developed confirmed active TB. 
One participant experienced latent TB for which they received Isoniazid.  
In the Safety Update, no study participants developed active TB. 
Covid-19 
Specific COVID-19 terms are not available in MedDRA version 19.0, therefore symptomatic, confirmed, or 
suspected COVID-19 was coded as PT ‘corona virus infectio’ and asymptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 was 
coded as PT“’coronavirus test positive’. 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, COVID-19 TEAEs were reported in 2 study participants (0.6%; EAIR: 1.9/100 participant-
years) in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 4 study participants (1.7%; EAIR: 5.5/100 participant-
years) in the placebo group. 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, COVID-19 TEAEs were reported in 72 study participants (7.8%; EAIR: 3.9/100 participant-
years) in the bimekizumab Total group. The incidence of PT corona virus infection was higher in Pool SA2 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 184/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than in Pool SA1 (7.8% vs 0.6%, respectively), likely reflecting the increased prevalence of COVID-19 
infection over time during the conduct of the axSpA studies. 
Overall, in the bimekizumab Total group, 3 study participants (0.3%) had a serious COVID-19. 
TEAE (all PT corona virus infection), and 1 participant experienced a severe event of corona virus 
infection (1 of the serious events). No participant discontinued due to a COVID-19 TEAE. Three study 
participants (0.3%) with a COVID-19 TEAE had an event assessed as drug related by the Investigator. 
The majority of COVID-19 TEAEs were reported as resolved at the time of the DLP. 
In the safety update, the incidence of COVID-19 TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group was 16.2%. The 
EAIR was higher in the Safety Update (7.0/100 participant-years) compared with the original submission 
(3.9/100 participant-year). The EAIR of the PT of corona virus infection was also higher in the Safety 
Update (6.2/100 participant-years) compared with the original submission (3.8/100 participant-years), 
reflecting the increased prevalence of COVID-19 infection over time during the conduct of the axSpA 
studies.

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
Pool SA1 
No adjudicated MACE or extended MACE were reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group or with 
placebo. 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, the overall incidence of adjudicated MACE was low, occurring in 4 study participants (0.4%; 
EAIR: 0.2/100 participant-years). Adjudicated MACE included cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular accident, 
acute myocardial infarction, and coronary artery stenosis (0.1%; EAIR: 0.1/100 participant-years each). 
Of the 4 study participants with adjudicated MACE, all events were serious, 3 were severe, and none was 
assessed as drug related by the Investigator. One study participant experienced a MACE with fatal 
outcome (cardiac arrest). None of the 3 remaining MACE led to study discontinuation or permanent 
withdrawal of study medication. Other than the fatal cardiac arrest, all other adjudicated MACE (75%) 
were reported as resolved. For 25 participants there was not enough information available to adjudicate 
or determine whether or not they should be classified as MACE.

4 adjudicated MACE cases: 
Table 90: Bimekizumab treated axSpA study participants with adjudicated MACE 
The four participants who experienced MACE had significant medical histories with cardiac risk factors. 
One study participant experienced a MACE with fatal outcome (cardiac arrest), which is discussed as part 
of the deaths that occurred during the study. None of the 3 remaining MACE led to study discontinuation 
or permanent withdrawal of study medication. 
One additional participant in the Safety Update experienced 3 concurrent events adjudicated as MACE 
(sudden cardiac death): cardio-respiratory arrest, ventricular fibrillation, and dyspnoea 
(0.1%; EAIR: 0.0/100 participant-years each). This event was fatal and is included in the discussion on 
deaths during this study. 
Extended MACE: 
Extended MACE occurred in 7 study participants (0.8%; EAIR: 0.4/100 participant-years) and included 
the adjudicated MACE described above plus arteriosclerosis coronary artery, angina pectoris, and cardiac 
failure, in the bimekizumab total group.

during the Combined Initial, Maintenance and OLE Treatment Period by Outcome Analysis Set: 
Pool SA2 
A recent meta-analysis suggests that the risk of atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular block is increased in 
patients with ankylosing spondylitis when compared to the general population. An increased risk of atrial 
fibrillation (RR: 1.85, 95%CI: 1.15-2.98) and atrioventricular block (OR: 3.46, 95%CI: 1.09-10.93) was 
found in AS subjects compared to the general population. In a subgroup analysis based on study design, 
a greater association between AS and atrioventricular block in cohort studies (RR: 5.14, 95%CI: 1.001-
26.50) compared to cross-sectional ones was noted. However, no association between AS and any 
arrhythmia (OR=3.36, 95% CI: 0.93-12.15), or conduction disorders (OR: 0.64, 95%CI: 0.38-1.06) was 
found. (Morovatdar et al) 
Based on a previous study, by Szabo et al, there is a 25% increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
in valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure and other cardiovascular 
diseases in AS patients. 
Suicide 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, there were no study participants with positive responses for suicidal ideation and/or 
behaviour during the Initial Treatment Period. 
Pool SA2 
Within Pool SA2, the incidence of treatment-emergent positive responses for suicidal ideation and/or 
behavior was low. Overall, 3 study participants had events adjudicated as SIB: suicidal ideation in 2 
participants (0.2%) and intentional self-injury in another participant (0.1%). All events were serious and 
severe. 
No completed suicides were observed in study participants. 
The event of suicidal ideation that led to study discontinuation and was considered drug related by the 
Investigator occurred in a study participant who had a history of depression as well as cannabis and 
alcohol abuse. This resolved with antidepressants. 
IBD 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, 2 study participants (0.6%; EAIR: 1.8/100 
participant-years) had TEAEs adjudicated as definite or probable IBD, which included 1 participant with an 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 188/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
event of definite IBD and 1 participant with an event of probable IBD (0.3%; EAIR: 0.9/100 participant-
years, each). 
Pool SA2 
Overall, in the bimekizumab Total group of Pool SA2, 15 study participants (1.6%; EAIR: 0.8/100 
participant-years) had TEAEs adjudicated as definite or probable IBD, which included 9 participants 
(1.0%; EAIR: 0.5/100 participant-years) with an event of definite IBD and 7 participants (0.8%; EAIR: 
0.4/100 participant-years) with an event of probable IBD 
One participant had multiple events in both categories. In the bimekizumab Total group, overall, 8 
participants (0.9%; EAIR: 0.4/100 participant-years) had an event adjudicated as possible IBD; all 
events occurred in participants without a history of IBD. 
Safety update: 
The incidence for any definite or probable adjudicated IBD in the Safety Update was 1.8% in the 
bimekizumab Total group; the EAIR in the Safety Update was consistent with the original submission 
(0.8/100 participant-years each), indicating no increase in risk with longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
Two additional participants had IBD TEAEs adjudicated as definite or probable. One study participant 
reported 1 TEAE of colitis and 1 TEAE of diarrhea that were both adjudicated as probable Crohn’s disease; 
1 study participant reported 1 TEAE of colitis ulcerative that was adjudicated as definite ulcerative colitis. 
Neither study participant had a medical history of IBD; both study participants had risk factors for IBD, 
such as smoking, concomitant medications (ie, NSAIDs), and HLA-B27 positive at baseline.

Malignancy 
Interleukin-17, with its pro-inflammatory properties, may play a dual role in cancer, serving either as a 
promoter or antitumor factor, possibly dependent on the cellular source. Thus, there is a theoretical risk 
that immunomodulators have carcinogenic potential. 
A meta-analysis of published data showed that AS is associated with a 14% (pooled RR 1.14; 95% CI: 
1.03–1.25) increase in the overall risk for malignancy. Compared to controls, patients with AS are at a 
specific increased risk for malignancy of the digestive system (pooled RR 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01– 1.42), 
multiple myelomas (pooled RR 1.92; 95% CI: 1.37–3.69) and lymphomas (pooled RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.11–
1.57) (Deng et al, 2016). Overall, in a study including 22 countries, the prevalence of any type of cancer 
has been estimated at 3.0% (95% CI: 2.46–3.52) in patients with spondyloarthropathies (Molto et al, 
2016). 
According to the MAH, there is no evidence to suggest that the number of malignancies in AS subjects 
exposed to bimekizumab is higher than what was expected. 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, no malignancy TEAE was reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group or in the placebo 
group. 
EMA/235041/2023

Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, the overall incidence of malignancies was low, occurring in 6 study participants (0.6%; EAIR: 
0.3/100 participant-years) in the bimekizumab Total group. 
Excluding non-melanomic skin cancers, the incidence rate of malignancies was also low in the 
bimekizumab Total group (5 participants [0.5%; EAIR: 0.3/100 participant-years]). By PT, all malignant 
tumor TEAEs were reported only once: breast cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, lung neoplasm 
malignant, superficial spreading melanoma stage I, basal cell carcinoma, and testicular seminoma (pure) 
([0.1%; EAIR: 0.1/100 participants each]). 
In the bimekizumab Total group, the TEAE of testicular seminoma (pure) was serious, severe, and led to 
study discontinuation; the TEAE of lung neoplasm malignant was serious and severe; and the TEAEs of 
clear cell renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and superficial spreading melanoma stage I were serious 
and mild or moderate in intensity.

Hypersensitivity 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, hypersensitivity reactions were reported at a higher incidence in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W group (6.0%; EAIR: 19.9/100 participant-years) compared with the placebo group (2.1%; EAIR: 
6.9/100 participant-years). The highest incidences of hypersensitivity reactions were reported in the SOC 
of Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (4.9% in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group vs 1.7% in the 
placebo group); mainly from the HLTs Rashes, eruptions and exanthems NEC (2.3% in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group and 0.4% in the placebo group) and Dermatitis and eczema (2.0% in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 0.4% in the placebo group). The most frequently reported TEAEs by 
PT in the SOC of Skin and subcutaneous tissue were rash (2.3%), dermatitis, eczema, and hand 
dermatitis (0.6% each). The majority of hypersensitivity reactions (92.3%) were reported as resolved. 
Pool SA2 
The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment 
Period was 13.5% (EAIR: 7.2/100 participant years) in the bimekizumab Total group. The majority of 
hypersensitivity reactions was reported in the SOC of Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (12.1%) in 
the bimekizumab Total group; mainly from the HLT Dermatitis and eczema (7.1%). The most frequently 
reported hypersensitivity reactions by PT were rash (3.3%), eczema (3.1%), and dermatitis (1.6%). The 
following additional hypersensitivity reactions by PT were reported in at least 5 study participants in the 
bimekizumab Total group: rash pustular, rhinitis allergic, dermatitis allergic, dermatitis contact, and 
dermatitis atopic. The majority of hypersensitivity reactions were reported as resolved (73.3%) or 
resolving (9.1%).

Table 94: Incidence of hypersensitivity reactions per 100 participant-years occurring in at 
least 5 study participants by HLT in BKZ Total group during the combined Initial, Maintenance, 
and OLE Treatment Period (Pool SA2) 
No participants had a serious hypersensitivity reaction, 1 participant had a severe hypersensitivity 
reaction, 5 participants discontinued due to a hypersensitivity reaction, and 41 participants had a 
hypersensitivity reaction considered drug related by the Investigator. 
The incidence for hypersensitivity reactions in the Safety Update was 15.6% in the bimekizumab Total 
group; the EAIR in the Safety Update (52-week data) was consistent with the original submission 
(7.2/100 participant-years), indicating no increased risk with longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
The most frequently reported hypersensitivity reactions by PT in the bimekizumab Total group in the 
Safety Update were eczema (4.0%; EAIR: 1.7/100 participant-years), rash (3.4%; EAIR: 1.5/100 
participant-years), and dermatitis (1.6%; EAIR: 0.8/100 participant-years) and were similar to the 
original submission. 
Injection site reactions 
Pool SA1 
The incidence of injection site reactions by HLT was reported by 3.4% (EAIR: 11.4/100 participant-years) 
of study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and by 1.7% (EAIR: 5.5/100 participant-
years) of study participants in the placebo group. By PT, injection site reaction TEAEs that occurred in >1 
study participant in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group were injection site pain (2.3%) and injection site 
erythema (0.2%). 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, the incidence of injection site reactions in the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE 
Treatment Period was low overall (2.8%; EAIR: 1.4/100 participant years in the bimekizumab Total 
group). By PT, the most frequently reported injection site reaction TEAE was injection site pain (1.5% of 
participants). All other PTs were reported in <1% of study participants. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 193/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All injections site reactions were nonserious and mild or moderate in intensity. One study participant 
discontinued due to a moderate TEAE of injection site reaction, which was considered drug related by the 
Investigator. 
The incidence for administration and injection site reactions in the Safety Update was 2.9% in the 
bimekizumab Total group; the EAIR was similar in the Safety Update (1.2/100 participant-years) and the 
original submission (1.4/100 participant-years) and did not indicate an increase in risk with longer 
exposure to bimekizumab. 
ADAb 
Treatment-emergent AEs, hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic reactions, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation in Pool SA2 (study participants initially randomised to bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W treatment, or initially randomised to placebo and initiating bimekizumab 160mg Q4W treatment at 
Week 16 in studies AS0010 and AS0011) were summarised by ADAb status. Study participants on 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W treatment who were ADAb positive were further analysed for NAb. TEAEs were 
summarised by NAb status using the following categories: 
•  ADAb negative 
•  ADAb positive / NAb negative 
•  NAb positive 
Pool SA1 and Pool SA2 
In Pool SA1, the incidence of study participants who were ADAb positive at Baseline was low (4.8% 
[15/313]). Overall, by Week 16, 35.5% (111/313) of study participants had at least 1 ADAb-positive 
sample. Approximately half of these (14.7% [46/313]) had at least 2 ADAb-positive samples by Week 16. 
Overall, by Week 24, 42.5% (133/313) of study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 
17.9% (36/201) of study participants in the placebo/bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group were ADAb 
positive. Overall, by Week 52 (based on all available data), 47.6% (149/313) of study participants in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 37.8% (76/201) of study participants in the placebo/bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group were ADAb positive. Of note, ADAb status up to Week 52 could not be derived for 
34.5% (108/313) and 24.9% (50/201) of participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and 
placebo/bimekizumab 160mg Q4W groups, respectively, mainly due to missing scheduled samples from 
study participants who had not yet reached Week 52. 
After the safety update: 
Overall by Week 52, 49.2% (154/313) of study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 
38.8% (78/201) of study participants in the placebo/bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had at least 1 
ADAb-positive sample. By Week 52, 34.5% (108/313) of participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group and 19.4% (39/201) of participants in the placebo/bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had at least 2 
ADAb-positive samples.

Pool SA2 
Incidences of TEAEs by time of onset relative to ADAb status in Pool SA2 were 53.1% (TEAEs starting 
before the first ADAb-positive result), 59.2% (TEAEs starting on or after the first ADAb-positive result), 
and 70.5% (TEAEs for participants who were always ADAb negative). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates 
were 283.5/100 participant-years (95% CI: 233.0, 341.7), 217.8/100 participant-years (95% CI: 183.0, 
257.3), and 167.8/100 participant-years (95% CI: 145.2, 192.9), respectively. The percentage of study 
participants reporting any TEAEs who were always ADAb negative was higher than the percentages of 
study participants reporting any TEAE starting before or starting on/after the first ADAb positive result; 
however, the EAIR was lower in the study participants who were always ADAb negative. 
The TEAEs with an incidence difference of ≥2.5% between TEAEs starting on/after the first ADAb-positive 
result and TEAEs starting before the first ADAb-positive result by PT were oral candidiasis (7.7% vs 
4.8%), otitis externa (2.6% vs 0), rhinitis (2.6% vs 0), and corona virus infection (4.3% vs 0.5%) in the 
Infections and infestations SOC, and arthralgia (4.3% vs 1.4%) and headache (2.1% vs 4.8%) from 
other SOCs, although the incidence of rhinitis, corona virus infection, and headache for TEAEs starting 
on/after the first ADAb-positive result was comparable with or lower than the incidence in participants 
who were always ADAb negative.

of study participants in any group and/or with an incidence difference of >2.5% between 
TEAEs starting before or on/after the first ADAb-positive result) (Pool SA2) 
Incidences of TEAEs leading to study medication discontinuation by time of onset relative to ADAb status 
in Pool SA2 were 0.5% [1/207] for TEAEs starting before the first ADAb-positive result, 4.7% [11/233] 
for TEAEs starting on or after the first ADAb-positive result, and 3.6% [10/281] for TEAEs in participants 
who were always ADAb negative. When adjusted for exposure, the EAIR for TEAEs starting on or after the 
first ADAb-positive result (8.1/100 participant-years [95% CI: 4.1, 14.5] was higher than for TEAEs 
starting before the first ADAb-positive result (1.5/100 participant-years [95% CI: 0.0, 8.1]) and for 
TEAEs in participants who were always ADAb negative (4.3/100 participant-years [95% CI: 2.1, 7.9]). 
No anaphylactic reactions were observed in the axSpA Phase 3 studies. 
In Pool SA2, the HLT of Injection site reactions was reported at a low incidence in all groups (<5%). The 
EAIR for TEAEs starting on/after the first ADAb-positive result (EAIR: 5.2/100 participant-years [95% CI: 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 198/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1, 10.7]) was lower than for TEAEs starting before the first ADAb-positive result (EAIR: 10.6/100 
participant-years [95% CI: 4.3, 21.8) and slightly higher than for TEAEs in participants who were always 
ADAb negative (EAIR: 3.0/100 participant-years [95% CI: 1.2, 6.2]). 
When adjusted for exposure, the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction TEAEs was slightly higher for 
TEAEs that started on/after the first ADAb-positive result (17.8/100 participant-years [95% CI: 11.3, 
26.7], n=23/233) compared with TEAEs starting before the first ADAb-positive result (13.9/100 
participant-years [95% CI: 6.4, 26.5], n=9/207) and was higher than in the group that was always ADAb 
negative (7.4/100 participant-years [95% CI: 4.3, 11.9], n=17/281). One study participant who was 
always ADAb negative experienced a TEAE of drug hypersensitivity.  
Exposure-adjusted incidences for hypersensitivity reaction TEAEs were lower in NAb-positive (EAIR: 
10.8/100 participant-years [95% CI: 4.9, 20.5]) than in ADAb positive/NAb-negative participants (EAIR: 
20.4/100 participant-years [95% CI: 12.8, 30.8]) and was lowest in ADAb-negative participants (EAIR: 
7.4/100 participant-years [95% CI: 4.3, 11.9]). 
Laboratory findings 
Parameters included are based on the set of biochemistry and haematology parameters routinely 
collected as part of the Phase 3 studies. Specific parameters summarised in Table 97 and Table 98 are as 
follows: 
•  Biochemistry: Calcium, chloride, magnesium, potassium, sodium, glucose, BUN, creatinine, ALP, 
AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, LDH, and total cholesterol. 
•  Hematology: Basophils (absolute counts), eosinophils (absolute counts), lymphocytes (absolute 
counts), monocytes (absolute counts), neutrophils (absolute counts), hematocrit, hemoglobin, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular 
volume, platelet count, RBC count, and WBC count. 
Markedly abnormal values are defined as those with a severity of Grade 3 and above based on the CTCAE 
Version 4.03.

Neutropenia 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, the incidence of neutropenia TEAEs reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group was low 
(0.6%; EAIR: 1.8/100 participant-years). 
No study participant in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a TEMA neutrophil value (<1.0x109/L). 
One study participant (0.4%) in the placebo group had a TEMA neutrophil value (CTCAE Grade 3 low 
neutrophil value at Week 16). 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, 11 study participants (1.2%) in the bimekizumab Total group had a TEMA neutrophils low 
count (<1.0x109/L). Of these 11 participants, 2 had confirmed pseudoneutropenia. Nine study 
participants had Grade 3 neutrophil values; all were transient and had resolved. Two study participants 
had reversible Grade 4 neutrophil values that returned to normal at subsequent visits. 
A spike in low neutrophil counts was observed during January to March 2021. These phenomena were 
observed across several ongoing studies at the time and were investigated by the central laboratory 
(ICON) for possible causes, as this was not in line with previous bimekizumab safety data. Most of the 
samples with low neutropenia count during this period were processed at the central laboratory and were 
from a small number of countries, including Russia and Poland. Data indicated that the occurrence of low 
neutrophil laboratory findings peaked during February 2021 and dates coincided with very cold 
temperatures in those locations. Additionally, these study participants were retested within a few days up 
to 3 weeks and were reported to be normal, suggesting that it was more likely that the neutropenia 
detected was ‘pseudoneutropenia’due to sample integrity issues (ie, exposure to cold temperatures 
during shipment) and not true neutropenia.

Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, during the Initial Treatment Period, the incidence of TEMA biochemistry laboratory values 
was low and similar between the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (0.9%) and the placebo group (0.4%). 
Two study participants (0.6%) in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 1 study participant (0.4%) in 
the placebo group reported high glucose TEMA biochemistry values (>13.9 mmol/L). One study 
participant (0.3%) in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group reported a potassium high TEMA biochemistry 
value (>6.0 mmol/L). 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, during the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period, 10 study participants 
(1.7%) in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, 18 study participants (2.1%) in Phase 2/3 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, and 25 study participant (2.7%) in the bimekizumab Total group 
reported any TEMA biochemistry laboratory value. The most frequently reported TEMA biochemistry value 
was high glucose (1.2% in the bimekizumab Total group); note that fasting before blood sampling was 
not a requirement. The proportion of study participants who experienced other TEMA biochemistry 
laboratory values was low (<1%). 
Vital signs and Physical examination 
Pool SA1 
No clinically meaningful changes in mean vital signs measurements were noted across treatment groups 
during the Initial Treatment Period. 
Table 99: Markedly abnormal systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the Initial Treatment 
Period (SA1) 
Pool SA2 
The number of study participants with markedly abnormal SBP or DBP was generally low and observed in 
≤2% of study participants in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, Phase 2/3 bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W, and bimekizumab Total group.

Physical examination findings 
No safety concern was identified from physical examination findings including body weight over time. This 
remained unchanged in the updated safety data.  
Electrocardiogram 
QTcF increases 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, the proportion of study participants with post-Baseline QTcF outliers was low, and no trends 
in QTcF increases were observed across treatment groups and no study participant had QTcF values 
>500ms. 
Table 101: Post-Baseline QTcF Outliers (Pool SA1)

The proportion of study participants with post-Baseline QTcF outliers was low, and no clinically meaningful 
trends were observed in the 12-lead ECG during the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment 
Period.

Table 102: Post-Baseline QTcF outliers (Pool SA2) 
Adverse events related to ECG findings 
A total of 11 study participants were identified experiencing 12 events (4 serious, 8 nonserious) coding to 
the PTs of cardiac arrest (1 study participant), ventricular fibrillation (1 study participant), syncope (8 
study participants), and loss of consciousness (1 study participant). 
Dose was not changed except for 1 event of syncope in which study medication was temporarily 
interrupted. None of the syncope events were associated with abnormal ECG findings. 
Overall, Safety Update results were comparable to those of Pool SA2 in the original submission and the 
incidences of TEAEs (by PT) related to ECG measurements remained low. Syncope TEAEs increased from 
8 to 9 events and 1 event each was reported for cardio-respiratory arrest and ventricular fibrillation. The 
new event of syncope was serious, mild, considered drug-related, and resolved without dose interruption.  
The new event of cardio-respiratory arrest was serious, severe, considered not drug-related, and had a 
fatal outcome. The event of ventricular fibrillation was not serious, severe, considered not drug-related, 
and had an unknown outcome. 
Both cardiac arrests were classified as not drug related. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of bimekizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies did 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/fetal development, 
parturition, or postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
bimekizumab in pregnancy. It is not known whether bimekizumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed 
systemically after ingestion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered 
along with the mother's clinical need for bimekizumab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed 
infant from bimekizumab or from the underlying maternal condition. This is reflected in section 4.6 of the 
SmPC. 
As of the clinical cut-off date (20 December 2021), no maternal bimekizumab exposure pregnancies were 
reported in the studies included in Pool SA2.

Age 
Pool SA1 
The vast majority of bimekizumab-treated study participants were <65 years of age in Pool SA1 (<40 
years: 51.0%, 40 to <65 years: 45.6%, and ≥65 years: 3.4%). The subgroup analysis is limited by the 
number of participants ≥65 years. 
In Pool SA1, the incidences of TEAEs in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group were higher in the oldest 
age group (66.7% in the ≥65 years age group) compared with the youngest age groups (54.5% and 
59.7%, respectively, in the <40 and 40 to <65 years age groups) and the same trend was observed for 
the placebo group (60.0%, 52.3%, and 47.0%, respectively). The highest difference in incidence of 
TEAEs (≥5%) in bimekizumab-treated study participants was observed in the SOC of Injury, poisoning, 
and procedural complications, which was mainly driven by the HLT Muscle, tendon and ligament injuries 
(<40 years, 40 to <65 years, and ≥65 years: 0%, 0.6%, and 16.7%, respectively). A higher incidence of 
TEAEs (≥5%) in the bimekizumab-treated study participants was also observed in the oldest age group 
compared with the youngest age groups in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
and Nervous system disorders. 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2 the vast majority of bimekizumab-treated study participants were (<40 years: 50.9%, 40 to 
<65 years: 45.6%, and ≥65 years: 3.6%, in the bimekizumab Total. The subgroup analysis is limited by 
the number of participants ≥65 years. 
When comparing all age groups with the oldest age group (≥65 years), the highest differences in 
incidences of TEAEs (≥5%) were in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (41.2% 
in the ≥65 years age group compared with 18.8% and 21.3% in the <40 and 40 to <65 years age 
groups, respectively), Nervous system disorders (24.2% in the ≥65 years age group compared with 
10.6% and 17.0% in the <40 and 40 to <65 years age groups, respectively), and Vascular disorders 
(21.2% in the ≥65 years age group compared with 4.2% and 9.7% in the <40 and 40 to <65 years age 
groups, respectively). Treatment-emergent AEs with a ≥5% difference in incidence in the Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (≥5%) were in the HLTs Joint related signs and symptoms, 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue pain and discomfort, and Spondyloarthropathies; these are 
conditions known to be more prevalent in the elderly population and, therefore, this difference is 
expected. 
In the Safety Update (and in the original submission), the majority of bimekizumab-treated study 
participants in the bimekizumab Total group were <65 years of age (<40 years: 50.9%, 40 to <65 years: 
45.6%, and ≥65 years: 3.6%).  
The TEAEs by age group were consistent with the trends observed in the overall Pool SA2. When 
comparing the <40 years age group and ≥40 years to <65 years age group with the oldest age group 
(≥65 years), the highest differences in incidences of TEAEs (≥5%) were in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (22.9% and 24.3% vs 51.5%), Vascular disorders (4.9% and 10.9% vs 
21.2%), and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (13.8% and 13.0% vs 33.3%) (Table 103). 
Treatment-emergent AEs with a ≥5% difference in incidence in the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders were in the HLTs of Joint related signs and symptoms (5.7% and 6.6% vs 15.2%) and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue pain and discomfort (8.1% and 6.9% vs 21.2%); these are 
conditions known to be more prevalent in the elderly population and, therefore, this difference is 
expected.

Table 103: TEAEs with >5% difference in incidence in SOC by age groups (Pool SA2) 
BMI 
Analysis of TEAEs by BMI was performed in Pool SA1 and Pool SA2 for the following categories: 
<25kg/m2, ≥25 to <30kg/m2, and ≥30kg/m2. 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, 151 study participants (43.3%) had BMIs <25kg/m2, 108 study participants (30.9%) had 
BMIs ≥25 to <30kg/m2, and 90 study participants (25.8%) had BMIs ≥30kg/m2 in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group. 
In Pool SA1, higher incidences of TEAEs were observed in the highest BMI group compared with the lower 
BMI groups in study participants treated with bimekizumab (≥30kg/m2: 63.3%, <25kg/m2: 56.3%, and 
≥25 to <30kg/m2: 53.7%) 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 205/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, 372 study participants (40.1%) had BMIs <25kg/m2, 321 study participants (34.6%) had 
BMIs ≥25 to <30kg/m2, and 235 study participants (25.3%) had BMIs ≥30kg/m2 in the bimekizumab 
Total group. 
In pool SA2, slightly higher incidences of TEAEs in the highest BMI group compared with the lower 
BMIgroups were observed in the bimekizumab Total group. 
These differences in incidence of TEAEs were most noticeable (≥5%) in the HLTs Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue pain and discomfort and Vascular hypertensive disorders NEC (9.5% vs 4.0% and 
4.6%, in ≥95kg vs <70kg and ≥70 to <95kg weight groups, respectively). There was a tendency for 
more serious and severe TEAEs in heavier study participants driven by the Infections and infestations 
SOC without any clear pattern, and more drug-related TEAEs in lower body weight participants driven by 
the HLT Candida infections. 
The Safety Update results for TEAEs by body weight were similar to the original submission. In the Safety 
Update (and in the original submission), 273 study participants (29.4%) weighed <70kg, 456 study 
participants (49.1%) weighed ≥70 to <95kg, and 199 study participants (21.4%) weighed ≥95kg in the 
bimekizumab Total group. 
The heavier study participants (≥95kg weight group) had a higher incidence of TEAEs in the 5 SOCs of 
General disorders and administration site conditions (16.6% vs 8.8% and 10.1%, respectively); Injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications (18.6% vs 14.3% and 12.1%, respectively); Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (30.7% vs 22.0% and 23.5%, respectively); Nervous system disorders 
(21.1% vs 16.1% and 14.0%, respectively); and Vascular disorders (13.1% vs 5.1% and 7.9%, 
respectively). These differences in incidence of TEAEs were most noticeable (≥5%) in the HLT of and 
Vascular hypertensive disorders NEC (10.1% vs 4.0% and 5.3%, respectively). Similar to the original 
submission, there was a tendency for more serious and severe TEAEs in heavier study participants, and 
more drug-related TEAEs in lower body weight participants. It is like that these TEAEs are BMI related 
and not related to bimekizumab. 
Race  
The majority of subjects in the study population were white, limiting the subgroup analyses by race. 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, the incidences of TEAEs were 53.5% for White 
study participants, 100% for Black study participants, and 73.1% for Asian study Participants. 
Table 104: Incidence of TEAEs by Race during the Initial Treatment Period Analysis Set: Pool 
SA1 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, the incidences of TEAEs were 80.0% for White study participants, 100% for Black study 
participants, and 85.7% for Asian study participants.

Table 105: Incidence of TEAEs by Race during the Combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE 
Treatment Period Analysis Set: Pool SA2 
Noticeable differences (>5% difference in incidence by SOC) in the incidence of TEAEs between White and 
Asian study participants are listed below (due to the low number of Black study participants [N=3], 
comparison between Black, White, and Asian study participants were not considered). 
• Infections and infestations (62.2% and 44.0%, in White and Asian study participants, respectively) 
−  HLTs >5% difference: Candida infections (10.5% and 2.4%, in White and Asian study 
participants, respectively); Fungal infections NEC (10.1% and 0%, in White and Asian study 
participants, respectively), Lower respiratory tract and lung infections (7.4% and 0%, in 
White and Asian study participants, respectively), Upper respiratory tract infections (34.9% 
and 21.4%, in White and Asian study participants, respectively), and Viral infections NEC 
(11.5% and 1.2%, in White and Asian study participants, respectively) 
• Investigations (15.6% and 31.0%, in White and Asian study participants, respectively) 
−  HLTs >5% difference: Liver function analyses (9.5% and 17.9%, in White and Asian study 
participants, respectively) 
• Vascular disorders (8.2% and 0%, in White and Asian study participants, respectively) 
−  HLTs >5% difference: Vascular hypertensive disorders NEC (6.2% and 0%, in White and 
Asian study participants, respectively) 
In the other 3 SOCs, the differences in the incidence of TEAEs (≥5% difference in groups) were not 
driven by a particular HLT: 
• Eye disorders (7.8% and 13.1%, in White and Asian study participants, respectively) 
• Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (23.5% and 8.3%, in White and Asian study 
participants, respectively) 
• Nervous system disorders (14.5% and 7.1%, in White and Asian study participants, respectively) 
Incidences of the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT in White and Asian study participants were: 
nasopharyngitis (15.8% and 3.6%, respectively) and upper respiratory tract infection (9.2% and 10.7%, 
respectively). 
In the Safety Update, 88.9% of study participants were White, 0.3% were Black, 9.1% were Asian, and 
1.7% were ‘Other’ in the bimekizumab Total group.  
Due to the small number of Black participants (N=3), comparisons between Black, White, and Asian study 
participants were not considered. Notable differences in incidence of TEAEs (≥5%) in White compared 
with Asian bimekizumab-treated study participants were observed in the SOCs of Infections and 
infestations (67.9% vs 58.3%, respectively); Blood and lymphatic system disorders (5.7% vs 11.9%, 
respectively); Eye disorders (9.1% vs 16.7%, respectively); Investigations (18.4% vs 42.9%, 
respectively); Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (25.5% vs 13.1%, respectively); Nervous 
system disorders (16.6% vs 10.7%, respectively); Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 207/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(10.9% vs 19.0%, respectively); Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (25.0% vs 31.0%, 
respectively); and Vascular disorders (9.1% vs 1.2%, respectively). Treatment-emergent AEs with a ≥5% 
difference in incidence between White and Asian participants in the Infections and infestations SOC were 
in the HLTs of Abdominal and gastrointestinal infections (2.7% vs 9.5%, respectively), Candida infections 
(11.4% vs 2.4%, respectively), Fungal infections NEC (10.7% vs 0%, respectively), Lower respiratory 
tract and lung infections (8.1% vs 1.2%, respectively), Tinea infections (1.9% vs 7.1%, respectively), 
Upper respiratory tract infections (39.2% vs 31.0%, respectively), Urinary tract infections (5.3% vs 0%, 
respectively), and Viral infections NEC (19.2% vs 6.0%, respectively). 
This is similar to the initial submission. 
Gender  
In Pool SA2, 672 study participants (72.4%) were male and 256 study participants (27.6%) were female 
in the bimekizumab Total group. The number of male study participants was more than twice as high as 
the number of female study participants; this was as expected due to higher male prevalence in AS. 
Incidences of the most frequently reported TEAE by PT were similar in female and male study 
participants: nasopharyngitis (14.1% [EAIR: 9.3/100 participant-years] and 15.0% [EAIR: 8.0/100 
participant-years], respectively). Incidences of the other most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were 
slightly higher in female compared with male study participants: oral candidiasis (10.9% [EAIR: 7.0/100 
participant-years] vs 7.0% [EAIR: 3.4/100 participant-years], respectively) and upper respiratory tract 
infection (11.7% [EAIR: 7.7/100 participant-years] and 8.5% [EAIR: 4.2/100 participant-years], 
respectively). 
There was no significant gender-based differences in TEAEs seen in the updated safety data. 
Geographical location 
No clinically significant pattern was observed with respect to geographic region for TEAE categories, 
including SAEs, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation. 
The Safety Update results for TEAEs by geographic region (North America, Western Europe, 
Eastern Europe, Asia) were similar to the original submission with no concerning findings seen.  
Baseline DMARDs 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in study 
participants who were using csDMARDs at Baseline compared with study participants who were not using 
csDMARDs at Baseline (62.3% vs 55.9%, respectively).

Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, in the bimekizumab Total group, the incidence of TEAEs was lower in study participants who 
were using csDMARDs compared with study participants who were not using csDMARDs at Baseline 
(80.9% vs 86.9%, respectively). 
Table 107: Incidence of TEAEs by Baseline Synthetic DMARD Use during the Combined Initial, 
Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period Analysis Set: Pool SA2 
Treatment-emergent AEs were summarized for study participants by csDMARD subgroup. The Safety 
Update results for TEAEs by csDMARD subgroup were similar to the original submission. 
In the Safety Update, 208 of 928 study participants (22.4%) were using csDMARDs at Baseline in the 
bimekizumab Total group. The incidence of TEAEs was slightly lower in study participants who were using 
csDMARDs compared with study participants who were not using csDMARDs at Baseline (86.1% vs 
89.9%, respectively). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No DDI studies have been conducted with bimekizumab. Given the mode of action of bimekizumab and 
studies conducted with other IL-17 and IL-23 antibodies, minimal impact is expected on the exposure of 
drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system. Population PK modeling found no evidence 
of a significant impact for use of medications concomitantly administered with bimekizumab in 
rheumatologic indications (MTX, corticosteroids, or csDMARDs) on bimekizumab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Pool SA1 
In Pool SA1, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was similar in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W group (2.3%) compared with the placebo group (2.1%).

Table 108: Incidence of TEAEs leading to study discontinuation per 100 participant-years by 
SOC and PT during the Initial Treatment Period (Pool SA1) 
Pool SA2 
In Pool SA2, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was 6.9% (EAIR: 3.4/100 participant-
years) in the bimekizumab Total group. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs leading to study 
discontinuation per 100 participant years did not increase between the Initial Treatment Period (EAIR: 
7.4/100 participant-years in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group in Pool SA1) and the longer-term 
combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period (EAIR: 3.1/100 participant-years in the Phase 3 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group in Pool SA2). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was 7.7% of study participants in the bimekizumab 
Total group in the Safety Update; the EAIR for TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the Safety Update 
(3.2/100 participant-years) was lower than in the original submission (3.4/100 participant-years), 
indicating no increase in TEAEs leading to discontinuation over time.  
A total of 6 additional TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported, including latent TB (2 events), 
cardio-respiratory arrest, skin infection, psychiatric evaluation abnormal, anxiety, and dermatitis allergic 
(1 event each); 1 TEAE PT of aphthous ulcer was updated to oral candidiasis in the Safety Update.

Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively since the approval on 20 August 2021 up to the data lock point on 19 February 2022, the 
post-authorisation patient exposure outside of clinical studies to bimekizumab is estimated to be 
approximately 588 patient-years. During the interval of the Bimzelx PSUR (20 August 2021 to 19 
February 2022), no safety related findings have been identified. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The spondyloarthritis program included 2 pivotal phase 3 studies including participants with nr-axSpA or 
AS to address the efficacy and safety profile in both subpopulations (AS0010 and AS0011).and a phase 3 
open label extension study (OLE AS0014). Phase 2 studies were conducted in participants with AS and 
not in participants with nr-axSpA.  
The safety assessment focuses on integrated safety data in the following data pools: 
•  Pool SA1 is the primary safety pool used to summarise the safety of bimekizumab compared with 
placebo through Week 16 of the Double-Blind Treatment Period in Phase 3 studies AS0010 and 
AS0011. 
•  Pool SA2 provides the most comprehensive overview of safety in axSpA by including all Phase 2 
and Phase 3 data from nr-axSpA and AS studies. 
•  Pool SA3 is provided as an overview of safety across the BKZ development program. 
The full week 52 data set was made available upon CHMP’s request and is further discussed below.  
A total of 928 adult study participants with active axSpA received bimekizumab. 
Pool SA1 consisted of a total of 586 study participants; 349 participants (128 participants with nr-axSpA 
[AS0010] and 221 with AS [AS0011]) were exposed to bimekizumab and 237 participants (126 with nr-
axSpA [AS0010] and 111 with AS [AS0011]) were exposed to placebo, with the total time at risk 
accounting for 108.6 participant-years in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 73.0 participant-years 
in the placebo group. 
Pool SA2 consisted of a total of 928 study participants; 574 participants with nr-axSpA (244 participants) 
or AS (330 participants) from the Phase 3 program of which 351 participants had entered the OLE 
AS0014 at the cut-off date, and 354 participants with AS from the Phase 2 program (303 participants 
from AS0008 of which 255 had entered the OLE AS0009 at the cut-of date, and 51 participants from 
AS0013), with 588 study participants in the bimekizumab Total group exposed to bimekizumab for at 
least 12 months, and a total time at risk accounting for 1907.5 participant-years. 
The extent of exposure of all axSpA patients to BKZ complies with the requirements described in ICH E1 
Population Exposure (300-600 exposed for 6 months and 100 patients exposed for a minimum of one 
year). Additional long-term data was considered necessary by the CHMP to detect late developing ADRs, 
increased incidences to an already increased background rate of comorbidities and low-frequency adverse 
drug reactions, thus the MAH was requested to submit the full week 52 safety data set. 
Regarding long term exposure, an OLE study AS0014was ongoing. An update on available safety data 
was provided and did not negatively impact the safety of bimekizumab.  
Demographic and Baseline characteristic variables were presented by treatment group for Pool SA1 and 
Pool SA2 and were generally well balanced. There was a larger proportion of male participants compared 
to female participants which reflects the disease in the population. The majority of subjects in SA1 
(82.9%) in the study population were white, under representation of Black or African Americans in the AS 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 212/230 
 
 
 
 
 
and nr-axSpA development program was raised as a concern. Nevertheless, this is accounted for by low 
HLA levels and lower disease rates in this population. Further, there is currently no evidence of a 
difference in safety between populations. 
Regarding background disease characteristics, in Pool SA1, the majority of study participants (93.7% in 
the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 91.1% in the placebo group) reported a previous or ongoing 
medical condition at baseline. The most frequently reported conditions/diseases at Baseline in all study 
participants were in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (64.5%). 
The most frequently reported medical history conditions at Baseline ≥5% by PT in All participants 
(bimekizumab 160mg Q4W or the placebo) were tendonitis (27.5%), arthritis (22.4%), hypertension 
(20.5%); peripheral arthritis (15.7%), uveitis (12.3%), vitamin D deficiency (8.2%), seasonal allergy 
(7.5%), psoriasis (7.0%), osteoarthritis (6.8%), gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (6.7%), dactylitis 
(6.5%), latent tuberculosis (6.3%), hypercholesterolaemia (6.0%), asthma (5.8%), obesity (5.6%), 
depression (5.5%), and drug hypersensitivity (5.1%). Previous or ongoing medical history conditions in 
Pool SA2 study participants were similar in the Safety Update and the original submission and are 
consistent with what is expected for this patient population. 
Comorbidities at baseline reflect the peripheral and extra-articular manifestations in patients with axSpA 
as well as other frequent comorbidities like metabolic syndrome (hypertension and obesity) and 
hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolaemia). 
In pool SA1, TEAEs were reported at a higher incidence in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared 
with the placebo group (57.3% vs 50.2%). The incidence of serious TEAEs was low overall and similar in 
the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (1.1%) compared with the placebo group (0.8%). 
In pool SA2, the majority of study participants in the bimekizumab Total group (85.6%; EAIR: 155.6/100 
participant-years) reported a TEAE. Exposure-adjusted-incidence-rates of serious TEAEs were 10.8%; 
EAIR: 5.6/100 participant-years. When adjusted for exposure for serious TEAEs in the Phase 3 
bimekizumab group in Pool SA2 (EAIR: 5.4/100 participant-years [95% CI: 3.9, 7.4]), there was a small 
numerical increase (with overlapping CI) in incidence rate with longer exposure compared to Pool SA1 
(EAIR: 3.7/100 participant-years [95% CI: 1.0, 9.5]). When adjusting for exposure for severe TEAEs in 
the Phase 3 bimekizumab group in Pool SA2 (EAIR: 4.0/100 participant-years [95% CI: 2.7, 5.7]), there 
was a small numerical increase (with overlapping CI) in incidence rate with longer exposure compared to 
Pool SA1 (EAIR: 2.8/100 participant-years [95% CI: 0.6, 8.1]) 
The incidences of TEAEs were higher in this Safety Update (52-week data) compared with the original 
submission, which is expected given the longer treatment duration and resulting increased total time at 
risk in the bimekizumab Total group (2241.1 vs 1907.5 participant-years, respectively). However, the 
EAIRs for the TEAE categories in the Safety Update are similar to or lower than those in the original 
submission and therefore do not indicate an increase in risk with longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
TEAEs were most frequently reported in the SOC of Infections and infestations. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs in bimekizumab-treated study participants in both pools were nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, and oral candidiasis. These are known adverse events, throughout the 
development programme for bimekizumab, and are listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Upon CHMP’s 
request, the warning on infections included in section 4.4 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that 
patients developing an infection should be carefully monitored that treatment should be discontinued if 
the infection becomes serious or is not responding to standard therapy until the infection resolves.   
Potential Hy’s Law was the only AESI defined for the axSpA program. Potential Hy’s Law, defined as ≥3x 
ULN ALT or AST with coexisting ≥2xULN total bilirubin in the absence of ≥2xULN alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), with no alternative explanation for the biochemical abnormality. A review of hepatic TEAEs in 
Pool SA1 and Pool SA2 was performed using the MedDRA SMQ “Drug related hepatic disorders” 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 213/230 
 
 
 
 
 
(excluding sub-SMQs “Liver neoplasms, benign [incl cysts and polyps]” and “Liver neoplasms, malignant 
and unspecified”). When adjusted for exposure, no increased incidence rate of a hepatic TEAEs was 
observed in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group from Pool SA2 (EAIR: 7.2/100 participant-
years) when compared with the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group from Pool SA1 (EAIR: 16.2/100 
participant-years). 
The incidence of hepatic TEAEs in the Safety update was 13.6% in the bimekizumab Total group; the 
EAIRs were similar in the Safety Update (6.3/100 participant-years) and the original submission (6.7/100 
participant-years), thus indicating no increase in risk with longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
In pool SA1 One case met Hy’s Law laboratory criteria but was not a confirmed as a Hy’s Law case due to 
a clinical and serological diagnosis of viral hepatitis A infection. 
The most frequently reported infections in the axSpA development program were nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, and oral candidiasis. When adjusted for exposure, no increased incidence rate 
of infections TEAEs was observed in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group from Pool SA2 (EAIR: 
68.3/100 participant-years) when compared with the Pool SA1 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (EAIR: 
119.4/100 participant-years). 
The incidences of fungal infections were lower compared to the incidences in the studies for the PSO 
indication in which a higher BKZ dose has been used. 
Participants reported as having ongoing infection at the time of the original submission have either 
recovered or have persistent mild infection. Rates of vulvovaginal mycotic infection were similar between 
placebo and treatment arms and appear to be in keeping with rates in the general population.  
Section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that infections rates observed in axSpA (nr-axSpA and 
AS) phase 3 clinical studies were similar to those observed in plaque psoriasis apart from oral and 
oropharyngeal candidiasis rates in patients treated with bimekizumab at 3.7% and 0.3% respectively (0% 
in the placebo group).  
In pool SA1, no adjudicated MACE or extended MACE were reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group or with placebo. In Pool SA2, the overall incidence of adjudicated MACE was low, occurring in 4 
study participants (0.4%; EAIR: 0.2/100 participant-years). Adjudicated MACE included cardiac arrest, 
cerebrovascular accident, acute myocardial infarction, and coronary artery stenosis (0.1%; EAIR: 0.1/100 
participant-years each).   
The overall incidence of adjudicated MACE in the Safety Update was 0.5% in the bimekizumab Total 
group; the EAIR of adjudicated MACE in the Safety Update was consistent with the original submission 
(0.2/100 participant-years each). 
One additional participant in the Safety Update experienced 3 concurrent events adjudicated as MACE 
(sudden cardiac death): cardio-respiratory arrest, ventricular fibrillation, and dyspnoea (0.1%; EAIR: 
0.0/100 participant-years each. The event of cardio-respiratory arrest was serious, severe, assessed as 
not drug-related by the Investigator, and fatal. It is accepted that this was not drug related. 
At the time of the DLP one participant was classified as experiencing MACE that was ‘extended’ This 
relates to a participant requiring PCI and stenting and has now resolved. 
The incidence of IBD in pool SA2 (0.8/100 PY) was higher than that observed during the PSO 
development program (0.055/100 PY in the Pool S2 in the PSO MAA). Though, was not elevated beyond 
background rates reported in literature. IBD should continue to be closely monitored in future PSURs. The 
incidence for any definite or probable adjudicated IBD in the Safety Update was 1.8% in the bimekizumab 
Total group; the EAIR in the Safety Update was consistent with the original submission (0.8/100 
participant-years each), indicating no increase in risk with longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 214/230 
 
 
 
 
 
In Pool SA1, no malignancy TEAE was reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group or in the placebo 
group. In Pool SA2, the overall incidence of malignancies was low, occurring in 6 study participants 
(0.6%; EAIR: 0.3/100 participant-years) in the bimekizumab Total group. No further malignancies were 
seen in the updated safety data. 
In Pool SA1, hypersensitivity reactions were reported at a higher incidence in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W group (6.0%; EAIR: 19.9/100 participant-years) compared with the placebo group (2.1%; EAIR: 
6.9/100 participant-years).  In Pool SA2, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in the combined 
Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period was 13.5% (EAIR: 7.2/100 participant years) in the 
bimekizumab Total group. 
The incidence for hypersensitivity reactions in the Safety Update was 15.6% in the bimekizumab Total 
group; the EAIR in the Safety Update was consistent with the original submission (7.2/100 participant-
years), indicating no increased risk with longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
One participant had a severe hypersensitivity reaction described as ‘skin allergic rash’ which was 
unresolved at the DLP. The study drug was discontinued for this participant, and they were referred to a 
dermatologist. No further information has been received on the participant since their Early Termination 
Visit in 2020. 
The MAH was asked to discuss in more detail why rash (2.3% in the BKZ group in pool SA1 versus 0.4% 
in the placebo group) was not included in the list of adverse drug reactions in the SmPC. The majority of 
cases were considered unrelated to bimekizumab by the Investigator. Though, about 30% were 
considered related by the investigator. As requested, a detailed causality assessment was performed by 
the MAH and section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated with ‘rash’ included as a common ADR. 
Regarding Immunogenicity to bimekizumab, the low number of participants does not allow definitive 
conclusions but a trend of increased incidence of hypersensitivity reaction TEAEs linked to ADAb positivity 
was observed. Therefore, the following sentence has been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC ‘Across 
indications, no clinically meaningful impact on clinical response was associated with anti-bimekizumab 
antibodies development and an association between immunogenicity and treatment emergent adverse 
events has not been clearly established.’ 
In Pool SA1, the incidence of neutropenia TEAEs reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group was 
low (0.6%; EAIR: 1.8/100 participant-years). No study participant in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group had a TEMA neutrophil value (<1.0x109/L). In Pool SA2, 11 study participants (1.2%) in the 
bimekizumab Total group had a TEMA neutrophils low count (<1.0x109/L), 2 were reported as 
pseudoneutropenia.  
A spike in neutropenia was noted between January and March 2021. This has been attributed to 
‘pseudoneutropenia’ from exposure of samples to low temperatures. A plausible mechanism of action has 
been provided. There are no significant changes to rates of neutropenia in the updated safety data. It is 
accepted that those seen are likely ‘pseudoneutropenia’ and not drug related. The section 4.8 of the 
SmPC was updated to reflect that the frequency of neutropenia in axSpA (nr-axSpA and AS) clinical 
studies was similar to that observed in plaque psoriasis studies.  
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH agreed to include PsA patients and axSpA patients in the PS0037 study. 
This will likely increase the sample size. See RMP section below.  
Overall, the summary of the safety profile is consistent with the important identified risks mentioned in 
the Safety Specification of the Risk management plan. At this time, additional updates to the summary 
of safety concerns are not warranted.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The 52-week safety data is in line with what was presented in the original submission and uncertainties 
regarding the possibility of delayed or rare safety issues with long-term use of bimekizumab in an active 
axial spondyloarthiritis population have been alleviated. However, this population will be included in the 
ongoing PASS study to allow for long-erm monitoring of safety (see RMP section).   
From the available safety data, the safety profile in the axial spondyloarthritis population is acceptable 
and was generally comparable with that established in the psoriasis population. Upon CHMP’s request, the 
addition of rash as a common adverse drug reaction has been made in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.8 is acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is an umbrella term applied to a family of rheumatic diseases (including axial 
spondyloarthritis [axSpA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA], reactive arthritis, the arthritis of inflammatory bowel 
disease [IBD], and undifferentiated SpA) that have features in common with each other and distinct from 
other inflammatory arthritides, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. 
Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) comprises diseases with mainly axial involvement (sacroiliac [SI] joints 
and spine), including: 
•  Ankylosing spondylitis (AS; also known as radiographic axSpA [r-axSpA]) requires a diagnosis of 
definite radiographic damage of the SI joints, as demonstrated by radiographic evidence. 
•  Nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) where there is no definite radiographic damage on the SI 
joints. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The goals of treatment of nr-axSpA and AS are to reduce symptom severity, maintain spinal flexibility 
and normal posture, reduce functional limitations, maintain work ability, decrease disease complications, 
and to slow progression of structural damage. 
The mainstays of treatment have been nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first line 
pharmacological treatment besides physical therapy, and exercise. Treatment with NSAIDs is effective for 
the symptoms (pain and stiffness) of axSpA, but many patients lose or never have a clinically meaningful 
response, and structural damage often progresses despite their use. 
Therapy options for axSpA are limited because conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (csDMARDs) eg, methotrexate and sulfasalazine or systemic glucocorticoids are not effective for the 
treatment of axial symptoms. Sulfasalazine may be considered in patients with peripheral arthritis. Intra-
articular corticosteroids may be used for sacroiliac or peripheral joint inflammation whereas systemic 
corticosteroids in general are of little benefit. 
Patients with active AS who are intolerant of or have inadequately responded to NSAIDs, or those in 
whom NSAIDs are contraindicated, have approved treatment options such as TNFα inhibitors. 
Additionally, the IL-17 cytokine family has been identified as a therapeutic target in axSpA. Janus kinase 
inhibitors have recently been approved for the treatment of patients with active axSpA. 
Whilst those agents are effective in reducing core signs and symptoms of axSpA, many patients still do 
not achieve full control of disease including low disease activity/remission and EAMs. Suboptimal 
responses and residual inflammation drive disease activity and structural disease progression; thus, 
chronic untreated disease may limit the effectiveness of treatment.  
In summary, spondyloarthritis is a degenerative musculo-skeletal condition for which many patients do 
not achieve relief through available therapies. As such, there is an unmet medical need for alternative 
therapies for this condition.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
With this submission, the MAH seeks a new indication for bimekizumab for the treatment of axial 
spondylarthritis (nr-axSpA and AS). The recommended dose of bimekizumab is 160 mg every 4 weeks. 
In support of the sought indication, the MAH is providing:  
i) supportive data from study AS0008 and its long-term extension study AS0009;  
ii) confirmatory evidence from two pivotal 52-week phase 3 studies AS0010 and AS0011.  
and the ongoing open label extension study AS0014.  
AS0008 was a Phase 2b, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
dose-ranging study to investigate the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of bimekizumab compared with placebo 
in adult study participants with active AS. Study participants were randomised 1:1:1:1:1 to 1 of 5 
groups; placebo or bimekizumab 16mg, 64mg, 160mg, or 320mg sc Q4W. Study participants who 
completed the 48-week AS0008 study were eligible to enter the open label extension study AS0009 
which has a 4-year duration, investigating long term safety, tolerability and efficacy of bimekizumab.  
AS0010 was a multicentre, Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in subjects with nr-axSpA. To be eligible to participate in this study, 
study participants must have had active adult-onset axSpA meeting ASAS classification criteria, with 
inflammatory back pain for at least 3 months prior to the Screening Visit and an age at symptom onset of 
<45 years. Study participants must have had objective inflammation, defined by sacroiliitis on the 
Screening MRI according to ASAS/Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) scoring 
and/or elevated CRP. Study participants must not have had radiographic sacroiliitis as defined by 
modified New York (mNY) criteria.  
AS0011 is a multicentre, Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in study participants with active AS, a subtype of axSpA with 
radiographic sacroiliitis (r-axSpA). To be eligible to participate in this study, study participants must have 
been adults with a diagnosis of active AS (as defined), including at least 3 months of symptoms and age 
at symptom onset <45 years, and moderate to severe active disease at Baseline. 
Study participants who completed Week 52 of AS0010 and AS0011 may be eligible for enrolment in an 
OLE study (AS0014) with bimekizumab. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for both pivotal phase 3 studies (AS0010 and AS0011) was the ASAS40 
response at Week 16. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Bimekizumab dose of 160 mg Q4W selected for the phase 3 pivotal AS0010 and AS0011 studies comes 
from the phase 2 AS0008 study.  
A statistically significant higher proportion (95% CI) of patients in the bimekizumab 160 mg Q4W group 
reached ASAS40 at week 16 in comparison to the placebo group: 47.7 (37.3, 57.7) % vs 21.4 (13.5, 
29.7) % (p<0.001) in AS0010 study; and 44.8 (33.3, 50.3) % 22.5 (12.9, 29.2) % (p<0.001) in AS0011 
study. The difference between treatment groups was observed as early as week 1 in AS0010 and week 2 
in AS0011.  
In the phase 3 studies AS0010 and AS0011, bimekizumab 160 mg Q4W resulted in a highly significant 
and clinically relevant ASAS40 response at week 16 (primary endpoint). In both trials, the primary 
endpoint result was corroborated by the outcomes of the secondary endpoints which included 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 224/230 
 
 
 
 
 
assessments of BASDAI score, BASMI score, ASDAS score, nocturnal spinal pain, inflammation as 
measured by hs-CRP levels, SPARCC score, ASspiMRI-a (Berlin modifications) score, BASFI score, ASQOL, 
SF-36, FACIT-Fatigue score, enthesitis-free state assessed by MASES index and incidence of uveitis. 
These primary and secondary endpoints are in line with EMA guidance on the clinical investigation of 
medicinal products for the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis.  
Efficacy, as demonstrated by e.g. ASAS40 response, was maintained up to week 52. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It has been seen in trials investigating the use of bimekizumab in other conditions that there can be a 
difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of the product in patients with higher BMI levels. In both studies 
AS0010 and AS0011 large treatment response differences were observed based on age (younger than 45 
years or 45 years and older) and based on BMI (BMI over 30 compared to BMI under 30). However, 
subgroup and post hoc analyses have shown that these differences did not have a significant effect on the 
outcome of the trials. As a result, no dose recommendation was warranted in these subgroups.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Pool SA1 was the primary safety pool used to summarise the safety of bimekizumab vs placebo treatment 
in axSpA through Week 16 in Phase 3 studies AS0010 and AS0011. Pool SA2 provided the most 
comprehensive overview of safety in axSpA by including all Phase 2 and Phase 3 data from nr-axSpA and 
AS studies. 
In pool SA1, TEAEs were reported at a higher incidence in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared 
with the placebo group (57.3% vs 50.2%). The incidence of serious TEAEs was low overall and similar in 
the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (1.1%) compared with the placebo group (0.8%). 
TEAEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs of Infections and infestations for both the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W and the placebo groups (30.4% and 23.6%, respectively). The incidences of nasopharyngitis 
were higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group (8.3% vs 4.2%, 
respectively). Rates of oral candidiasis were higher in the bimekizumab group compared with the placebo 
group (3.7% vs 0 participant). The incidences of uveitis and upper respiratory tract infection were lower 
in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group (0.6% vs 3.4%). 
In Pool SA1, during the Initial Treatment Period, the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity 
in both treatment groups. The incidence of severe TEAEs was low overall and similar between the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (0.9%) and placebo group (0.4%) group. 
In Pool SA1, incidences of serious TEAEs were low and similar in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
(1.1%) and in the placebo group (0.8%) during the Initial Treatment Period. By PT, all serious TEAEs by 
PT were reported by 1 study participant in any treatment group. 
No severe TEAEs, by PT, were reported by >1 study participant. 
In Pool SA2, the majority of study participants in the bimekizumab Total group (85.6%; EAIR: 155.6/100 
participant-years) reported a TEAE.  
Almost half of study participants 45.4%;( EAIR: 33.7/100 participant-years) had TEAEs that were 
considered drug-related. 
Treatment-emergent AEs in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the SOCs of 
Infections and infestations (60.7%), Gastrointestinal disorders (24.9%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (23.3%), and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (10.5%). The most frequently 
EMA/235041/2023 
Page 225/230 
 
 
 
 
 
reported TEAEs by PT were nasopharyngitis (14.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (9.4%), oral 
candidiasis (8.1%), and corona virus infection (7.5%). 
During the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period, the incidence of serious TEAEs was 
10.8% (EAIR=5.6/100 participant-years [95% CI: 4.6, 6.8]) of study participants in the bimekizumab 
Total group. Serious TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the SOCs of 
Infections and infestations (3.0%), Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (1.5%), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (1.4%). 
In Pool SA2, the incidence of severe TEAEs was low overall. A total of 7.1% of study participants in the 
bimekizumab Total group reported severe TEAEs during the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE 
Treatment Period. Severe TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the 
SOC of Infections and infestations (1.6%). Most severe TEAE were isolated cases.  
The incidences of TEAEs were higher in the 52-week Safety Update compared with the original 
submission, which is expected given the longer treatment duration and resulting increased total time at 
risk in the bimekizumab Total group (2241.1 vs 1907.5 participant-years, respectively). However, the 
EAIRs for the TEAE categories in the Safety Update are similar to or lower than those in the original 
submission and therefore do not indicate an increase in risk with longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
In the bimekizumab Total group, TEAEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections and 
infestations (67.1%), Gastrointestinal disorders (28.4%), and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(25.9%).  
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group by PT were nasopharyngitis 
(18.0%), corona virus infection (14.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.4%), and oral candidiasis 
(8.7%). 
Other Safety topics of interest included malignancies, MACE, neutropenia, SIB, IBD, hypersensitivity 
reactions, and injection site reactions. No new safety concerns emerged from analyses of the remaining 
safety topics of interest based on the current axSpA submission. 
In Pool SA1, in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in study 
participants who were using csDMARDs at Baseline compared with study participants who were not using 
csDMARDs at Baseline (62.3% vs 55.9%, respectively). 
In Pool SA2, in the bimekizumab Total group, the incidence of TEAEs was lower in study participants who 
were using csDMARDs compared with study participants who were not using csDMARDs at Baseline 
(80.9% vs 86.9%, respectively). This was also seen in the updated safety data to Week 52. 
Approximately 57% of patients with nr-axSpA treated with bimekizumab up to 52 weeks at the 
recommended dosing regimen (160 mg every 4 weeks) had anti-drug antibodies. Of the patients with 
anti-drug antibodies, approximately 44% (25% of all patients treated with bimekizumab) had antibodies 
that were classified as neutralising. Approximately 44% of patients with AS treated with bimekizumab up 
to 52 weeks at the recommended dosing regimen (160 mg every 4 weeks) had anti-drug antibodies. Of 
the patients with anti-drug antibodies, approximately 44% (20% of all patients treated with 
bimekizumab) had antibodies that were classified as neutralising. 
There is a numerical imbalance for the incidence of the PT rash in pool SA1: 2.3% in the BKZ group 
versus 0.4% in the placebo group. The imbalance in the incidence of the PT Rash between placebo and 
bimekizumab was less pronounced in the overall S3 pool combining 16-week data for the three 
indications (0.4% on placebo and 0.8% on bimekizumab). ‘Rash’ has been added to SmPC section 4.8 as 
a ‘common’ adverse reaction. 
EMA/235041/2023

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH agreed to include subjects with axSpA in the long-term PASS study 
(PSO038) for subjects with PSO to further characterise the long-term safety profile in this new indication 
post approval. In addition, the PASS on pregnancy will also include patients with axSpA. 
Regarding immunogenicity, the low number of participants does not allow definitive conclusions but a 
trend of increased incidence of hypersensitivity reaction TEAEs linked to ADAb positivity was observed. 
Therefore, the section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that an association between 
immunogenicity and treatment emergent events has not been clearly established.  
A known risk for use of Bimekizumab is infection. All ongoing infections are considered mild or moderate 
and have not led to treatment discontinuation. The section 4.4 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that if 
a patient develops an infection, the patient should be carefully monitored and if the infection becomes 
serious or is not responding to standard therapy, treatment should be discontinuer until the infection 
resolves. This will also be monitored in the ongoing PASS study (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A clinically relevant and robust effect as measured by ASAS40 has been demonstrated for bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W in the target population of subjects with active axial spondyloarthritis. The persistence of 
this effect was maintained up to week 52. In addition, there are support from key secondary endpoints 
measuring different aspects of the disease.  
The safety findings in the axial spondyloarthritis development programme were generally consistent with 
the findings in the plaque psoriasis development programme.  
The most common TEAEs in participants treated with bimekizumab were in the areas of infection, 
nasopharyngitis and oral candidiasis. The majority were non serious with only a small subset of events 
leading to discontinuations.  
Use during pregnancy and lactation and long-term safety will be followed-up post approval.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, bimekizumab has a positive effect in the treatment of nr-axSpA and AS with benefits that 
outweigh the risks.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bimzelx in the treatment of AS and nr-AxSpA is positive.

Extension of indication to include treatment of adults with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis), based on results from two interventional and controlled phase III clinical studies: 
AS0010 (BE MOBILE 1) and AS0011 (BE MOBILE 2), which provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of

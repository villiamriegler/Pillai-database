PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 
LOJUXTA (LOMITAPIDE) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Lojuxta. The RMP details important risks 
of Lojuxta, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Lojuxta’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Lojuxta’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Lojuxta should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Lojuxta should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones are included in updates of Lojuxta's RMP. 
I.  
The medicine and what it is used for 
Lojuxta is authorised to treat adult patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, an 
inherited disease causing high blood levels  of cholesterol (a type of fat). It is used together with a low 
fat diet and other medicines to reduce the level of fats in the blood. The patient’s disease should be 
confirmed by genetic testing whenever possible (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
lomitapide as the active substances and it is given orally as a capsule. 
Further information about the evaluation of Lojuxta’s benefits can be found in Lojuxta’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/lojuxta 
II.  
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Lojuxta, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Lojuxta risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Lojuxta, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Lojuxta is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Lojuxta are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Lojuxta. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk: Hepatic effects 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Hepatic effects, such as steatosis and abnormal plasma aminotransferase 
levels, were common during clinical trials, and appear to be the direct result 
of the lomitapide mechanism of action. Hepatic effects (elevated 
aminotransferases, hepatic steatosis)) are considered important identified 
risks. 
(Adams, 2005 CMAJ; Bedogni, 2005 Hepatology; Browning, 2004 
Hepatology; Clark, 2006 J Clin Gastroenterol; Clark, 2003 Am J 
Gastroenterol; Cortez-Pinto, 2004 Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol; Eckel, 
2010 Lancet; Ghany, 2011 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine; 
Giboney, 2005 Am Fam Physician; Joy, 2008 Nat Clin Pract Cardiovasc 
Med; Lazo, 2011 BMJ; Shen, 2003 World J Gastroenterol; Yueh, 2011 
Diabetes Res Clin Pract) 
There have been no cases of acute hepatotoxicity (i.e., cases that met Hy’s 
law criteria) observed in the lomitapide clinical development programme, 
including the pool of Phase 2 studies conducted in over 600 subjects with 
elevated LDL-C and other cardiovascular risk factors, the Phase 2 HoFH 
study, or the Phase 3 HoFH major effectiveness study, including its long-
term extension study. 
Across the lomitapide programme, 5 studies included an evaluation of 
hepatic fat. Review of scatter plots across these 5 studies showed no 
apparent relationship between exposure to lomitapide (based on average or 
nominal dose or total lomitapide dose) and maximum hepatic fat percent. 
In the post-marketing setting, cumulatively through 31 Jul 2020, there were 
505 ICSRs reporting 764 hepatic events. 
There is no published evidence that untreated familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (FH) induces important hepatic co-morbidities. 
Furthermore, no specific data were retrieved regarding the epidemiology of 
elevated aminotransferases and hepatic steatosis in this population. 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic 
liver disease in the United States and other Western countries, with a 
prevalence as high as 30% in the general population. The disease 
encompasses a wide spectrum of conditions, ranging from steatosis to non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis (Lazo, 2011 BMJ).   
In the general population, increased hepatic enzymes may be detected in up 
to 4% of asymptomatic subjects (Giboney, 2005 Am Fam Physician). A US 
study of 15,676 adults above 17 years of age found elevated ALT or AST in 
7.9% of subjects (Clark, 2003 Am J Gastroenterol). Interestingly, only 1/3 
of them had a medical history that could obviously explain this finding (i.e., 
high alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis or iron overload). In the remaining 
 
 
 
Important identified risk: Hepatic effects 
cases, the study revealed an association between increased ALT or AST and 
higher body mass index, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and lower high-
density lipoprotein (HDL). Women with type 2 diabetes and hypertension 
were also more likely to have abnormal hepatic enzymes. 
Major risk factors for liver disease include alcohol abuse, long-term 
exposure to various medications (including herbal compounds, birth control 
pills, and over-the-counter medications), sexual promiscuity, extensive 
travelling, exposure to jaundiced or other high-risk persons, recent surgery, 
remote or recent transfusion with blood and blood products, and family 
history of liver disease (Ghany, 2011 Harrison's Principles of Internal 
Medicine).  
With regard to elevated aminotransferases of non-specific origin, an 
epidemiological study using data from the Third US Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey identified the following risk factors: higher body mass 
index, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and lower HDL (in both sexes), type 2 
diabetes and hypertension (in women only) (Clark, 2003 Am J 
Gastroenterol). All these parameters may indicate the presence of metabolic 
syndrome, which is diagnosed when at least three of the following criteria 
are met: increased waist circumference, increased triglycerides, reduced 
HDL cholesterol, increased blood pressure, and increased fasting glucose 
(Eckel, 2010 Lancet). A significant correlation between metabolic syndrome 
and abnormal ALT was seen in a recent study of 1,313 Taiwanese subjects 
(Yueh, 2011 Diabetes Res Clin Pract). 
Insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes and dyslipidaemia are also risk factors 
for hepatic steatosis (Cortez-Pinto, 2004 Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol). 
The incidence of hepatic AEs and elevated aminotransferases was examined 
to determine if the type of co-administered statin drug appeared to influence 
the risk of these events. No clear association between the type of 
concomitant statin and the incidence, type, or severity of hepatic AEs or 
laboratory abnormalities during treatment with lomitapide was observed. 
Because 27 of the 29 patients in the Phase 3 study were on statins, the 
influence of concomitant statins on hepatic AEs is unknown.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The AEs most frequently reported across the entire program were of GI 
origin and included diarrhoea, abdominal distension, and vomiting. GI 
effects (nausea, diarrhoea, weight loss, malabsorption of fat-soluble 
vitamins, and decline in essential fatty acids) and are considered an 
important identified risk. 
 (Bharucha, 2007 The Merck Manual for Health Care Professionals; Britt, 
2007 Aust Fam Physician; Feldman, 1994 Epidemiol Infect; Greenberger, 
2008 The Merck Manual for Health Care Professionals; Ruiz, 2008 The 
Merck Manual for Health Care Professionals; Samaha, 2008 Nat Clin Pract 
Cardiovasc Med; Thomas, 2003 Gut; Yamanaka, 1980 Prog Lipid Res) 
In the clinical development program, in Study UP1001, 5 patients 
experienced gastrointestinal disorders (83.3%) and in study UP1002 
(AEGR-733-005), 27 patients experienced gastrointestinal disorders 
(93.1%) 
In the post-marketing setting, cumulatively, through 31 Jul 2020, there were 
1673 ICSRs (1218 solicited, 436 spontaneous, 19 literature) reporting 3069 
GI events. 
There are multiple possible causes of nausea and/or vomiting, such as 
disorders of the GI tract (bowel obstruction, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, 
gastroparesis), central nervous system (head injury, brain haemorrhage, 
increased intracranial pressure, migraine, motion sickness), or systemic 
(drug adverse reaction, cancer, diabetic ketoacidosis, liver or renal failure, 
pregnancy, severe pain) (Greenberger, 2008 The Merck Manual for Health 
Care Professionals). 
Acute diarrhoea may result from infections, food poisoning or adverse 
reaction to medications. The causes of chronic diarrhoea are more complex 
and, in addition to drugs, include cancer (gastrointestinal or endocrine), 
irritable bowel syndrome, carbohydrate intolerance, inflammatory bowel 
disease, malabsorption syndromes, surgery and hyperthyroidism (Bharucha, 
2007 The Merck Manual for Health Care Professionals).

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Drug interaction studies indicated that lomitapide 60 mg increased 
simvastatin levels by a factor of 1.7 when the 2 drugs were co-administered. 
Because lomitapide is indicated as an adjunct to other lipid lowering 
treatments (and statins are commonly prescribed in patients with HoFH), 
this interaction was considered to be an important risk. (Ghany, 2011 
Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine; Khan, 2009 Neth J Med; 
Simvador, 2010 Summary of Product Characteristics) In the clinical 
development programme: The incidence of hepatic AEs and elevated 
aminotransferases was examined to determine if the type of co-administered 
statin drug appeared to influence the risk of these events. No clear 
association between the type of concomitant statin and the incidence, type, 
or severity of hepatic AEs or laboratory abnormalities during treatment with 
lomitapide was observed. Because 27 of the 29 patients in the Phase 3 study 
were on statins, the influence of concomitant statins on hepatic AEs is 
unknown. 
In the post-marketing setting, cumulatively up to 31 Jul 2020, there were 2 
spontaneous cases of potential interaction between lomitapide and statins. 
The first case reported additionally serious events of Cardiac failure 
congestive, Cerebral haemorrhage, Cerebrovascular accident, Haemorrhage, 
Haemorrhagic stroke, Hepatotoxicity, Hypovolaemic shock, International 
normalised ratio increased, Liver function test increased, Myocardial 
infarction, and Subdural haematoma. The second case reported a non-
serious event of Liver function test increased. 
Risk factors for rhabdomyolysis/myopathy are numerous, including blunt 
trauma, certain toxins (such as addictive psychoactive drugs and carbon 
monoxide) and medications (such as statins and fibrates), prolonged 
immobilisation, excessive muscular activity, temperature extremes, muscle 
ischaemia, infections, electrolyte imbalances and genetic disorders (Khan, 
2009 Neth J Med). 
The risk factors for liver disease are discussed under “Identified Risk: 
Hepatic events” of this Module VII.

groups 
Clinical Study: No cases of hepatic fibrosis were observed in CTs with 
lomitapide. 
Post-marketing experience: Cumulatively, up to 31 Jul 2020, were 2 cases 
of serious hepatic fibrosis. 
Liver fibrosis results from continuous damage to the liver, such as that 
caused by viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, drugs (e.g. amiodarone, 
chlorpromazine, isoniazide, methotrexate, methyldopa, tolbutamide), 
metabolic diseases involving an overload of iron or copper, autoimmune 
diseases, or congenital abnormalities (Balsano, 2009 Curr Drug Targets; 
Shaffer, 2007 The Merck Manual for Healthcare Professionals).  
Metabolic syndromes, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 
diabetes, represent strong risk factors in the development of fatty liver 
disease and related fibrosis (Balsano, 2009 Curr Drug Targets).

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, increased incidences of liver and 
small intestinal tumours occurred at exposures (AUC) to lomitapide relevant 
to those in humans at 60 mg. Because lomitapide was not genotoxic, it was 
concluded that these tumours were secondary to a non-genotoxic 
 
 
 
 
Important potential risk: Primary hepatic tumours 
mechanism. In addition, an increased incidence of benign pancreatic acinar 
cell adenoma was observed in high-dose male rats at an exposure 6 times 
that in humans at the 60 mg dose. As the relevance of these findings for 
humans is unknown, primary hepatic, small intestinal and pancreatic 
tumours are included as important potential risks.  
Clinical Study: No cases of benign or malignant liver neoplasms were 
observed with lomitapide. 
Post-marketing experience: Cumulatively, 1 case reporting Primary hepatic 
tumour has been reported from the post marketing sources up to 31 Jul 
2020. This serious solicited case concerned a 67-year-old female patient 
who was diagnosed (about 3 years after starting lomitapide treatment) with 
serious events of pancreatic and hepatic carcinoma stage IV. Six months 
after being diagnosed with cancer, the patient passed away. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with cirrhosis in 50% to 80% of 
patients; 5% of cirrhotic patients eventually develop hepatocellular cancer, 
which is often multifocal. Other major risk factors include a history of 
hepatitis B or C, obesity and eating foods tainted with aflatoxin (National 
Cancer Institute, 2011a).

Important potential risk: Small intestinal tumours 
Post marketing experience: One case reporting a small intestine carcinoma 
was identified up to 31 Jul 2020. This solicited case concerned a 63-year-
old female patient. Relevant risk factors included patient's medical history 
of cervical cancer, glandular cancer, and Meckel diverticulum. However, 
due to the plausible temporal association between the onset of the small 
intestine carcinoma (outcome unknown) and the administration of 
lomitapide, the causal relationship cannot be completely excluded. Of note, 
the treatment was resumed at the same dosage as prior to the hospitalization 
for the intestinal carcinoma, thus making the causal association more 
doubtful. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk factors for small intestinal cancer include a high fat diet, Crohn’s 
disease, celiac disease and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) 
(Hoofnagle, 2011 Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol; National Cancer 
Institute, 2011c).

carcinoma stage IV. Six months after being diagnosed with cancer, the 
 
 
 
Important potential risk: Pancreatic tumours 
patient passed away. Note, this is the same case described in Hepatic 
Tumours. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Most pancreatic cancers have mutations in genes KRAS, p53 and p16, 
which are associated with the control of tumour growth. BRCA2 mutations 
have also been involved in some pancreatic cancers (European Society for 
Medical Oncology, 2012).  
Known risk factors for pancreatic cancer include a family history of the 
disease (between 10% and 20% of pancreatic cancers may have a familial 
component), cigarette smoking (25% of patients with pancreatic cancer are 
or have been long-term cigarette smokers), obesity and chronic pancreatitis 
(European Society for Medical Oncology, 2012). Furthermore, the risk of 
pancreatic cancer increases considerably with age. More than 8 out of 10 
cases (80%) are diagnosed in people aged 60 and over, whilst people 
younger than 40 are rarely affected (Cancer Research UK, 2013).

Important potential risk: Unintended pregnancy 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
In an oral study of embryofoetal development, lomitapide was administered 
to presumed-pregnant rats on days 6 through 15 of gestation at doses of 
0.04, 0.4, or 4 mg/kg. Lomitapide caused foetal malformations (abdomen, 
tail, heart, limbs or paws, and anus as well as delays in ossification of the 
cranial, vertebral, and pelvic bones) at 0.4 and 4 mg/kg and maternal 
toxicity at 4 mg/kg, and is therefore considered teratogenic in rats.  
By contrast, lomitapide was not teratogenic in an embryofoetal development 
study in rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg. 
In an oral study to evaluate fertility and general reproduction in rats, no 
adverse effects on reproduction were observed in males at doses of 0.2, 1, or 
5 mg/kg or in females at doses of 0.04, 0.2, or 1 mg/kg. 
Lomitapide was teratogenic in rats in the absence of maternal toxicity at an 
exposure (AUC) estimated to be less than that in humans at 60 mg. Since 
 
 
 
 
Important potential risk: Unintended pregnancy 
pregnant women were not included in clinical studies with lomitapide, the 
potential risk for humans is unknown 
No cases of unintended pregnancy were identified in clinical trials with 
lomitapide. The have been 16 reports of pregnancy up to 31-Jul-2020, four 
of which were unintended pregnancy and concerned birth of live premature 
infant who developed fatal nosocomial infection which was not related to 
lomitapide, 1 was terminated via abortion due to social reasons, and 2 
resulted in healthy infants. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Lomitapide may induce diarrhoea and vomiting and thus decrease the 
absorption of oral contraceptives. All women of reproductive age using oral 
contraceptives may be affected, as diarrhoea and vomiting were among the 
most common GI disorders associated with lomitapide treatment. They 
occurred in 80% and 34% of HoFH subjects, respectively.

To evaluate the occurrence of the following in patients treated with lomitapide: 
Hepatic abnormalities 
Gastrointestinal (GI) events 
Small bowel, hepatic, colorectal and pancreatic tumours 
Events associated with coagulopathy 
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) events

· 
· 
· 
· 
Death, including cause of death 
To evaluate the occurrence and outcomes of pregnancy in females of reproductive potential 
treated with lomitapide who decide to continue the pregnancy following advice from a 
teratologist. The outcome of primary interest is major congenital anomalies. Refer to Section 
7.2.3 of the LOWER protocol for more detail. 
To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of lomitapide in maintaining control of serum lipid 
levels in clinical practice. 
To evaluate whether prescribers of lomitapide enrolled at study sites are following the 
screening and monitoring recommendations as specified in the product information (PI) and 
the prescriber educational materials aimed at risk minimisation. 
To evaluate the safety risks related to the use of alcohol in patients treated with lomitapide. 
To evaluate safety data concerning the use of lomitapide in non-Caucasian patients. 
To evaluate the safety of lomitapide in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease. 
To evaluate the safety of lomitapide in patients concomitantly treated with potentially 
hepatotoxic agents. 
LILITH study  
Study short name and title: 
Evaluation of the effect of lomitapide treatment on major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in 
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). 
Rationale and study objectives:  
Primary objective: 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the occurrence of MACE after three years of 
treatment with lomitapide as compared to the occurrence of MACE during three years before the 
initiation of lomitapide. 
Secondary objectives: 
To evaluate the changes of LDL-C and other lipoproteins at one, two and three years of lomitapide 
treatment and the correlation of these laboratory evaluations with changes in MACE occurrence 
To evaluate changes in the levels of AST, ALT, GGT at one, two and three years of lomitapide 
treatment, as measures of safety 
To evaluate the discontinuation of LDL apheresis during follow-up and the adherence to lipid-
lowering medications (including lomitapide). 
Study design:  
Multicenter, open-label, retrospective and prospective study 
Study population:  
HoFH patients over the age of 18 years will be enrolled through a network of lipid centres. 
Milestones: 
 
Final study report to be submitted by 30 Jun 2027.

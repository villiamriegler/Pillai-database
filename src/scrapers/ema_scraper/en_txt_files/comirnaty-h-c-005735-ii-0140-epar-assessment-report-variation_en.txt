2. 
Introduction 
Pfizer and BioNTech have developed the COMIRNATY vaccine to prevent the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on SARS CoV-2 spike (S) 
glycoprotein antigens encoded in RNA and formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The COMIRNATY 
vaccine is also referred to as COVID-19 Vaccine (BioNTech code number BNT162b2, Pfizer code 
number PF-07302048). 
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple mutations have led Pfizer/BioNTech to develop 
variant vaccine constructs. Specifically, the emergence of Omicron (B.1.1.529) as a variant of concern 
(VOC) is the subject of this variation. To assist in the public health crisis, a new 30 μg BNT162b2 
Tris/Sucrose Bivalent drug product, consisting of the original and Omicron (B.1.1.529) active 
substance strains, is being introduced to the MA as a new variant vaccine. 
This application concerns a booster dose with a bivalent original/Omicron (BA.1) vaccine, (BNT162b2 
15 µg + BNT162b2 OMI 15 µg). It is based primarily on clinical data from Study C4591031 Substudy E 
investigating the safety, tolerability, and immune responses in approximately 1840 older adult (>55 
years of age) participants up to 1-month post-Dose 4 follow-up. Supportive data are provided from 
Study C4591031 Substudy D investigating safety, tolerability and effectiveness of an investigational 
monovalent Omicron BA.1 vaccine in approximately 640 younger adult (≥18 to ≤55 years of age) 
participants up to 1-month post-Dose 4 follow-up. 
The Bivalent vaccine is manufactured by mixing two active substance (AS) strains in a 1:1 ratio prior 
to the Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) Formation and Stabilization step and is manufactured at previously 
authorized/licensed Pfizer/BioNTech sites. The Bivalent vaccine is formulated in Tris/Sucrose, 
presented in a 30 μg total RNA dose, and filled at 2.25 mL/vial (which is intended to deliver 
approximately 15 μg of each strain in a 0.3 mL injection volume), allowing six doses per vial.

3.  Quality aspects 
3.1 Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a dispersion for injection containing 15 micrograms of 
tozinameran and 15 micrograms of riltozinameran as active substance, embedded in lipid 
nanoparticles.  
Tozinameran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free 
in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 (Original).  
Riltozinameran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free 
in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron BA.1). 
Other ingredients are: ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate) (ALC-
0315), 2-[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide (ALC-0159), 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), Cholesterol, Trometamol, Trometamol hydrochloride, Sucrose, 
Water for injections. 
The product is available as a 2.25 mL dispersion in a 2 mL clear multidose vial (type I glass) with a 
stopper (synthetic bromobutyl rubber) and a grey flip-off plastic cap with aluminium seal. Each vial 
contains 6 doses. Pack sizes: 10 vials or 195 vials. 
3.2 Active substance (CTD module 3.2.S) - Tozinameran 
The active substance tozinameran is already approved in the existing Comirnaty conditional marketing 
authorisation. No changes to the information related to tozinameran are proposed. 
3.3 Active substance (CTD module 3.2.S) - Riltozinameran 
General information (CTD module 3.2.S.1) 
Section 3.2.S.1 has been updated with information related to the Omicron variant. The RNA nucleotide 
Sequence of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) active substance is included. It is clarified that the product codes 
BNT162b2 (B.1.1.529), Omicron ((B.1.1.529) and BNT162b2s05 have been used throughout the 
documents. It is confirmed that, except for the Omicron specific sequence, the construct is the same 
as for the approved variant. In general, the information provided is considered adequate. In response 
to a question raised by CHMP, section 3.2.S.1.3 has been updated with correct values for theoretical 
length and mass of the Omicron variant. 
Manufacture (CTD module 3.2.S.2) 
Manufacturer(s) (CTD section: S.2.1) 
All proposed active substance manufacturing and testing sites are already approved in the existing 
Comirnaty conditional marketing authorisation (EU/1/20/1528/001-005) for the manufacture of the 
active substance tozinameran. The GMP compliance of these sites has been previously confirmed.

Description of manufacturing process and process controls (CTD section: S.2.2)  
The manufacturing process and process controls are the same as currently approved for the 
manufacture of tozinameran. 
Control of materials (CTD section: S.2.3) 
Manufacture of the BNT162b2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant vaccine active substance is achieved using 
in vitro transcription that includes a linear DNA template as a starting material. The linear DNA 
template is produced via plasmid DNA from transformed DH10B Escherichia coli cells.  The plasmid is a 
7,815 base pair plasmid designed for the production of Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant.   
Figure 3.2.S.2.3-1. Omicron Plasmid Map 
BNT162b2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant vaccine active substance is manufactured by in vitro 
transcription using a linear DNA template, produced via plasmid DNA (Omicron) from transformed 
DH10B Escherichia coli cells. The functional elements of the Omicron plasmid are sufficiently described 
in graphic and tabular formats and the sequence is included.  The source and generation of the 
Omicron plasmid are not clearly documented. However, as the plasmid used in the manufacture of the 
original vaccine was generated using the same procedure, included in the original dossier, and as the 
nucleotide differences between Omicron and the original plasmids are located only within the gene 
encoding the spike sequence, the information provided is considered sufficient. 
The sites involved in manufacturing, testing and storage of the plasmids are listed.  
The master cell bank involved in the plasmid manufacturing process is described. MCB qualification 
tests are listed and include morphologic and genotypic identity, DNA sequencing, absence of 
contaminating bacteriophages and viability. Relevant specifications are set and data from the current 
MCB are provided. Restriction map analysis, plasmid retention and plasmid copy number are included 
as characterization studies with report result as a result criterion. It is stated that any unexpected 
results obtained from the characterization tests will be further evaluated. The approach is endorsed.  
Working cell banks (WCB) are not yet available from MCB FT1817 manufactured at Pfizer Chesterfield. 
Additional information has been provided on the preparation, testing and batch data for three WCBs 
intended to be used at Pfizer Andover GH and Hospira Zagreb, Novartis/Sandoz GmbH and AGC 
Biologics GmbH. Testing and characterization strategy are provided. Stability studies are also ongoing 
for all these WCBs batches, following a cell bank stability program, similar to the of the original 
plasmid WCB.

Omicron plasmid is manufactured by a fed-batch fermentation process initiated from the bacterial 
master cell bank, identical to the process described in the original dossier. 
Specifications for the circular plasmid DNA as well as for the DNA linear template are provided. 
Process- and product-related impurities including host cell genomic DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins, 
bioburden and plasmid isoforms, for the plasmid DNA, are quantified routinely. Results from three 
different batches are provided for the circular and linearized plasmid. All analytical methods used for 
the control of the linear DNA template obtained from Omicron plasmid are identical to the already 
provided methods used for testing of the original DNA template except for the identity of the transgene 
region which is tested using a DNA Sanger sequencing method. This method was updated to include 
Omicron-specific reagents and sufficient descriptions and summary of the validation exercise are 
included.  
A shelf life of 12 months is requested based on the BTN162b2 original vaccine and supported by 
limited data collected in an on-going stability study that have been initiated for the Omicron circular 
plasmid DNA and linearized DNA. Only 1 month data results are currently available for the specific 
Omicron variant. However, considering that no changes are included in the manufacturing process of 
the DNA template as compared to the original variant, the shelf-life is considered sufficiently supported 
by the original data.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates (CTD section: S.2.4)  
The control of critical steps and intermediates are the same as currently approved for the manufacture 
of tozinameran. 
Process validation and/or evaluation (CTD section: S.2.5)  
For process validation of the Omicron variant the Applicant refers to data on the original version of the 
active substance. This can be accepted since the manufacturing process is identical to that used for the 
original variant. 
Manufacturing process development (CTD section: S.2.6)  
Section 3.2.S.2.6 has been updated with a document describing manufacturing process history for the 
Omicron variant.  
The batch numbering system is not described for the Omicron variant. In response to CHMP question, 
the applicant explained that the full batch numbering system was not reflected in the dossier. Each 
batch can be uniquely identified by material number and batch number, and the material number was 
previously not provided in the dossier. The batch numbers are now updated to include both the 
material number and the batch number. It is also described that from 01-Jul-2022 a new ERP system 
is used which creates unique batch numbers for each batch (across all material numbers). The dossier 
has been updated accordingly. The response is found acceptable. 
The Applicant states that since the manufacturing process is identical to that used for the original 
variant and the constructs are similar, the cause and effect and the FMEA risk assessment apply to 
both constructs. This is agreed to. 
Information on the batches manufactured to date are provided. Critical process parameters (CPPs) 
have been defined and in-process test for monitoring (IPT-M) and for control (IPT-C) are presented for 
the Omicron (B.1.1.529) active substance manufacturing process 2. The CPPs, IPT-Cs and IPT-Ms are 
the same as those defined for the approved variant. The acceptance criteria are in almost all cases the 
same as for the approved variant. This is found acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 8/142 
 
 
 
 
No additional comparability assessment and no process validation data is provided with this 
submission.  For process validation of the Omicron variant the Applicant refers to data on the original 
version of the active substance. This can be accepted since the manufacturing process is identical to 
that used for the original variant. Batch analysis data provided in 3.2.S.4.4 supports consistency in 
manufacturing of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant active substance. The absence of comparability data 
is found acceptable since the Omicron variant constitute a new active substance. However, full 
characterisation of the Omicron variant should be provided, as requested in section 3.2.S.3. 
Characterisation (CTD module 3.2.S.3) 
In the initial submission, Section 3.2.S.3 was not updated with Omicron specific data. This was not 
considered acceptable, and a major objection was by raised by CHMP on the absence of 
characterisation data on the omicron variant, which is considered mandatory to guarantee safety of the 
product.  
In response, the Applicant has provided characterisation data for the Omicron (BA.1) variant. The 
package includes confirmation of primary structure, 5’-Cap structure, higher order structure and 
biological activity. Essentially, the same methods as those used for characterisation of the original 
variant have been applied. It is noted that primary structure analysis by NGS has been excluded. 
However, the HPLC-UV and LC-MS/MS studies are found sufficient to confirm the primary structure. 
Biological activity is confirmed by western blot analysis and cell-free in vitro translation. This is found 
acceptable. However, some details for the western blot analysis are lacking and the identity of the 
observed bands are not clear. It is recommended that the applicant provide this information post-
approval. 
• 
The expressed protein size for BNT162b2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) DS is evaluated by western 
blot. The Applicant claims that the protein size is consistent with the expected size of the 
translated protein. However, the theoretical protein sizes of the mature protein and variants 
thereof are not presented in the dossier. This information should be provided, and the bands 
observed by WB should be assigned. In addition, the antibody used for western blot should be 
further described, i.e., it should be stated if it targets the S1 or S2 domain of the protein. The 
dossier should be updated accordingly (REC1). 
Control of active substance (CTD module 3.2.S.4) 
The specification for Riltozinameran (Omicron (B.1.1.529) active substance) is presented. The active 
substance specifications contain tests for appearance (clarity, coloration (Ph. Eur.)), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
content (RNA Concentration) (UV Spectroscopy), Identity of Encoded RNA Sequence (RT-PCR), RNA 
Integrity (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis), 5’- Cap (RP-HPLC), Poly(A) Tail (ddPCR), Poly(A) Tail Length 
(IP-RP-HPLC), Residual DNA Template (qPCR), dsRNA (Immunoblot), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.) 
and Bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
The acceptance criteria are applicable from batch release to end of shelf-life. The acceptance criteria 
provided are based on the available data. These criteria will be reassessed and amended as 
appropriate when more data become available. 
The proposed specification for Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant active substance follows the specification 
established and approved for the original variant and therefore is considered adequate.  
Analytical procedures for (B.1.1.529) Omicron variant active substance (AS) release and stability 
testing are listed and briefly described in the dossier.  Most of the analytical procedures are identical to 
the corresponding commercial BNT162b2 original vaccine procedures, apart from identity testing, for 
which Omicron variant-specific reagents are utilized. Considering that the active substance 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 9/142 
 
 
 
 
concentration, formulation process and process control remain unchanged as compared to BNT162b2 
original active substance and only a change in nucleotide sequence is differentiating the Omicron 
(B.1.1.529) variant, the approach is endorsed. The method is sufficiently described, and additional 
validation exercises have been performed at the relevant sites.  
The applicant was requested to further explain and justify the claimed updates performed on the qPCR 
method. In response, the updates performed on the qPCR method, allowing for additional calculation 
which accounts for a base pair size difference between the original and the variant, have been clarified 
and are considered sufficiently justified. 
Batch results are presented for DS batches used for clinical trials, process confirmatory studies, and 
stability studies. All batches met the specification acceptance criteria in place at the time of release. 
The specification and limits for Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant active substance is based on the 
BNT162b2 original active substance: Although the limited data provided for the Omicron variant are 
not fully supporting these limits, the strategy is found acceptable considering that only a change in the 
nucleotide sequence is driving the present variation. It is stated that these criteria will be reassessed 
and amended as appropriate when more data become available, which is endorsed. 
Reference standards of materials (CTD module 3.2.S.5) 
The reference standard described in Section 3.2.S.5 for the Original vaccine remains unchanged for the 
Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant vaccine.  The Applicant was asked to sufficiently justify why a new 
reference standard is not considered necessary for analytical tests applied to evaluate the Omicron 
variant.  In response, the Applicant explained that the only assay that requires a reference standard is 
the DP fluorescence assay. As mRNA of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) vaccine variant has the same 
structure, highly similar sequence, size and base composition as that of the Original vaccine variant, it 
is found acceptable to use the same reference standard. The justification is found acceptable. 
Container closure system (CTD module 3.2.S.6) 
The container closure system is the same as for the currently approved active substance, tozinameran. 
Stability (CTD module 3.2.S.7) 
The proposed shelf-life for the Omicron (B.1.1.529) active substance is 6 months when stored at the 
intended storage condition of -20 ± 5°C in EVA bags. Thus, the proposed shelf-life and storage 
conditions are identical to those for the original variant. The shelf-life claim is based on primary 
stability studies conducted on the commercial active substance batches of the original vaccine. 
Stability studies for the Omicron batches are on-going. Protocols for the studies are provided. To date 
three months stability data for a clinical batch and one month’s data for a confirmatory batch has been 
provided. In addition, one month’s data is provided from accelerated and thermal stress studies. All 
data provided to date meet the acceptance criteria in place at the time of testing. This is 
acknowledged. 
Since accurate stability protocols are provided, no trends are observed at accelerated conditions and 
since the original and Omicron variants are considered very similar, the claimed shelf-life is considered 
sufficiently justified based on data from the original variant. 
3.4 Finished product (CTD module 3.2.P) 
Description and composition of the finished product (CTD module 3.2.P.1) 
The bivalent vaccine finished product is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of RNA-containing lipid

Dose Multi-dose Vial 
All excipients except the functional lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159, the structural lipid DSPC and the 
buffer component TRIS HCl comply to Ph. Eur. grade. The functional lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159, 
the structural lipid DSPC and the buffer component TRIS HCl are all used in the currently approved 
Tris/sucrose and PBS/sucrose drug formulations of Comirnaty (EU/1/20/1528/001-005). 
The container closure system is a 2 mL Type I borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and a 13 mm 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and is the same container closure system as for the already approved 
Tris/sucrose finished product of Comirnaty. 
The processing aids and active substance formulation buffer components are residues that are 
essentially removed through the manufacturing process and are not considered as ingredients 
(excipients).

This Type II-variation introduces a bivalent finished product of Comirnaty that is a preservative-free, 
sterile dispersion of RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles in an aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for 
intramuscular administration. The bivalent finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM 
Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 7.4 and contains an approximate 1:1 ratio of the original and omicron 
variant strains. The bivalent finished product is filled at 2.25 mL fill volume, is administered without 
dilution providing 6 doses at 30 μg RNA/dose in 0.3 mL injection volume. Each strain, original and 
omicron (BA.1), is present at approximately 15 μg/dose. 
Two active substances are utilized in the bivalent vaccine, the original active substance (tozinameran) 
and omicron (BA.1) active substance (riltozinameran). The original and omicron active substances are 
combined in an approximately 1:1 ratio by mixing prior to LNP formation. 
The formulation of the bivalent vaccine includes four lipids as well as some other excipients that are 
identical with the composition of the currently approved original vaccine of Comirnaty in the 
Tris/sucrose formulation (EU/1/20/1528/002-005). 
A revised QTPP has been developed for the bivalent vaccine and is presented below in Table P.2-1. No 
changes have been made compared to the QTPP for the original vaccine in Tris/sucrose formulation 
except for a reflection of the use of two strains of mRNA, the inclusion of RNA ratio as a quality 
attribute and that the claimed shelf-life is 12 months.

According to the applicant, no change in physicochemical properties, processability and stability is 
expected for the bivalent vaccine compared to the original vaccine in the Tris/sucrose formulation. This 
is agreed to. 
A development history and lot genealogy and usage of the bivalent vaccine has been provided. An 
initial supportive clinical finished product lot (Pfizer Andover) and a confirmatory finished product lot 
(Pfizer, Puurs) has been manufactured as well as an additional lot at commercial scale (Pfizer, Puurs).

The original and bivalent finished product manufacturing processes have identical unit operations and 
the processing parameters for these steps are maintained. The only difference to the manufacturing 
processes is the DS dilution step and a confirmatory lot was manufactured to demonstrate 
acceptability of this step. 
The LNP and finished product formulations and processes have remained the same throughout 
development of the original vaccine except for necessary changes to the scale as development 
progressed from initial clinical supplies to commercial manufacture, and changes related to the 
introduction of the Tris/sucrose formulation from the PBS/sucrose formulation. 
Comparability has previously been acceptably demonstrated between clinical and commercial scale 
original finished product, between various manufacturing sites and between the PBS/sucrose finished 
product and Tris/sucrose finished product formulations via comprehensive studies including both 
release testing and extended characterization testing. Due to the application of the same formulation, 
manufacturing process, and the use of the same manufacturing sites as the original finished product, 
extensive prior experience is leveraged, and it is found acceptable and sufficient that comparability has 
been established between the bivalent vaccine finished product to the original finished product based 
on an evaluation of release testing results against the acceptance criteria in the finished product 
specification. 
For the bivalent vaccine, batch analysis data are provided in section 3.2.P.5.4 for the batches 
manufactured to date, i.e. for a commercial scale confirmatory batch and two supportive batches. All 
these batches met the specification acceptance criteria in place at the time of testing. This is found 
acceptable. 
The process used to manufacture the bivalent finished product is essentially the same as the validated 
process used to manufacture the original vaccine in the Tris/sucrose formulation. 
The bivalent finished product requires both active substances to be combined in an approximately 1:1 
ratio, whereas the original vaccine uses a single active substance. Process parameters utilized for 
mixing the diluted active substance in the original vaccine are applied to the mixing of the diluted 
active substances of the bivalent vaccine and result in a homogeneous solution, as the original and 
omicron active substances have very similar solution properties.  
Results from mixing studies and characterization data have been provided demonstrating the ability to 
apply the existing validated manufacturing process parameters from the original vaccine to the 
bivalent finished product giving a homogeneous finished product with the desired quality attributes. 
Two lots have been manufactured for commercial supply at Puurs, lot GA2789 which is the 
confirmatory lot and an additional commercial supply lot, GC3898. These lots were subject to 
additional characterization to confirm homogeneity of the active substances after mixing and in the 
finished product lot. Satisfactory results have been provided in support of the conclusions made. The 
overall design of these tests was the following: Upon pooling and dilution, the active substance batches 
(original and omicron DS batches) were mixed using the original finished product mixing process. A 
sample was pulled out following the mixing process to test RNA concentration and RNA ratio. After LNP 
manufacturing and fill and finish, samples were taken from the beginning, middle and end of the filling 
process and tested for RNA concentration, RNA encapsulation and RNA ratio. The provided data 
confirm that the bivalent process results in homogeneous mixing of both strains. Furthermore, all 
finished product release testing attributes were within the acceptance criteria of the finished product 
specifications document in section 3.2.P.5.1. 
This is found acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 14/142 
 
 
 
 
 
The control strategy for bivalent finished product is based upon the control strategy for the original 
vaccine in the Tris/Sucrose formulation. 
All quality attributes and controls described for the original vaccine in the Tris/Sucrose formulation are 
still applicable to the bivalent finished product. In addition, RNA Ratio is introduced as a quality 
attribute specific to the bivalent finished product. Furthermore, it can be noted that the weight of 
original and the weight of omicron active substance has been categorized as a CPP with a set-point to 
achieve an approximate 1:1 ratio by mass. 
The analytical testing strategy for the bivalent finished product identity and RNA ratio testing uses a 
method based on reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). This method 
is described in section 3.2.P.5.2 and validation data provided in section 3.2.P.5.3. The ddPCR-method 
is also included in the finished product specifications document in section 3.2.P.5.1 for the use in 
release testing of finished product. 
The container closure system is a 2 mL Type I borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and a 13 mm 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and is the same container closure system as for the already approved 
Tris/sucrose finished product of Comirnaty.  
Sufficient information has been provided in section P.2.5 with respect to microbiological attributes. 
Acceptable information from compatibility studies has been provided in section P.2.6. 
In conclusion, the information provided on the pharmaceutical development of the bivalent vaccine is 
found sufficient and acceptable. 
Manufacture (CTD module 3.2.P.3) 
The bivalent vaccine is manufactured at manufacturing sites, and using the same platform 
manufacturing process, as currently approved for Comirnaty Tris/Sucrose vaccine formulation 
(EU/1/20/1528/002-005). The GMP compliance of these sites has been previously confirmed. 
The manufacturing process consists of LNP fabrication, bulk finished product formation, sterile filtration 
and aseptic filling. There are no changes in the manufacturing except for the first step including 
thawing and mixing of active substance. In the manufacture of the bivalent vaccine both original and 
omicron (BA.1) strains are combined to an approximately 1:1 ratio by mass. Similar controls during 
manufacturing and similar hold timed are applied for both original and bivalent finished product. The 
manufacturing process is considered sufficiently described including acceptable in-process controls 
(IPCs) and hold times. 
The maximum commercial batch size is XX L of bivalent finished product solution, corresponding to 
approximately XX vials. A batch size range of XX – YY L may be used. The batch size range is similar to 
the approved original Tris/Sucrose vaccine. 
No process validation is performed for the bivalent finished product. A mixing study to evaluate 
homogeneity is performed and data are provided. Section 3.2.P.2.3 of the dossier has been updated to 
provide a third commercial scale batch (GC3889) of the bivalent vaccine finished product. GC3898 was 
manufactured at XX L scale, while both GA2789 and GC3889 were manufactured at XX L scale.  All 
three batches are studied at the beginning, middle and end of the filling process confirming a 
homogeneous mixing of both strains. This is found acceptable. 
Control of excipients (CTD module 3.2.P.4) 
The bivalent vaccine contains the same excipients as the currently approved Comirnaty vaccine 
(Tris/Sucrose formulation). 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 15/142 
 
 
 
 
The lipid nanoparticle (LNP) consists of two functional lipids; a cationic lipid (ALC-0315) and a 
PEGylated lipid (ALC-0159) and two structural lipids; DSPC and cholesterol. Other excipients are 
sucrose, tromethamine (Tris base), Tris HCl and water. Processing aids used during manufacturing are 
ethanol, citric acid monohydrate, sodium hydroxide, HEPES and EDTA. All excipients are sufficiently 
controlled in accordance with in-house specifications and/or Ph. Eur. monographs. 
Control of finished product (CTD module 3.2.P.5) 
The finished product specifications for the bivalent vaccine finished product presented in Table P.5-1 
include tests for tests for Appearance (Visual), Appearance (Visible Particulates), Subvisible Particles 
(Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), Osmolality (Osmometry), LNP Size (Dynamic Light Scattering), LNP 
Polydispersity (Dynamic Light Scattering), RNA Encapsulation (Fluorescence assay), RNA content 
(Fluorescence assay), RNA ratio (ddPCR), ALC-0315 content (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), ALC-0159 
content (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), DSPC content (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), Cholesterol content (HPLC-
CAD, HPLC-ELSD), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), Lipid identities (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), Identity of 
encoded RNA sequence (ddPCR), Potency / in Vitro Expression (Cell-based flow cytometry), RNA 
Integrity (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), Sterility (Ph. Eur.) and 
Container Closure Integrity (Dye incursion).  
This comprehensive set of relevant tests with corresponding acceptance criteria and are based on 
those established for the original finished product for the majority of the test attributes. The 
acceptance criteria for release and stability testing of the bivalent finished product are the same as for 
the original vaccine for all quality attributes except for the RNA ratio that is related to the mixing of the 
original and omicron strains.  
Since the acceptance criteria for the bivalent vaccine finished product are based on the currently 
approved original vaccine finished product for the majority of test attributes, these acceptance criteria 
for test attributes are considered as clinically qualified to ensure quality, efficacy and safety. 
For the RNA ratio, a limit  for the original and the omicron strains is proposed.  This is not fully justified 
by the submitted batch data  and no additional justification is provided. It is acknowledged that the 
experience is limited to a small number of finished product lots, manufactured from a limited number 
of active substance batches, and the current specifications provide adequate assurance on the ratio. 
Nevertheless, when a sufficient number of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Wildtype and Omicron) Finished 
Product batches are manufactured, the MAH has provided a commitment to reassess and optimise the 
proposed specification for the RNA ratio by Q2 2023 (REC2). 
In the control of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Wildtype and Omicron) Finished Product, a droplet digital 
Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) method is proposed for determination of the identity of encoded 
RNA sequences and of the RNA ratio in the bivalent vaccine. The ddPCR technology is a digital form of 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that uses a water-in-oil emulsion system to quantify target nucleic 
acids. Thousands of nanoliter sized droplets are formed from each sample, and PCR amplification is 
then performed on each droplet. Post amplification, fluorescence is measured in order to detect the 
number of positive and negative droplets. It is acknowledged that ddPCR technology permits a superior 
quantification of low expressing/abundant targets and is less sensitive to low amounts of impurities 
possibly present in the reaction solution. The technical procedure is considered adequately described 
and the suitability of the method for the intended purpose is sufficiently justified. 
The method has been validated under BTx PharmSci ARD, USA, Pfizer Global Supply (PGS) Quality 
Control (QC) with adequate results obtained at Grange Castle (GC), Ireland and PGS QC in Andover 
(AND), MA, USA. The method is therefore considered transferred to PGS GC and PGS AND through this 
co-validation exercise. The performance of the test method was evaluated against a set of defined 
acceptance criteria for an ‘assay’ analytical procedure (RNA ratio) and an ‘identification’ analytical

procedure for bivalent finished product, including precision (repeatability and reproducibility), 
accuracy, linearity, range and specificity. An analytical protocol detailing the validation of the analytical 
procedure at an additional testing laboratory, BioNTech Mainz, has been provided in the 
documentation. The successful completion of the analytical validation defined here will provide 
assurance that the analytical procedure is suitable for its intended use and is established at the 
additional laboratory. The approach is endorsed. 
The Cell-based flow cytometry analytical procedure is used for determining in vitro expression of the 
SARS-CoV-2 S2 antigen in bivalent vaccine finished product transfected human embryonic kidney 
(HEK293T) cells. The method is identical with analytical procedure used for potency determination of 
the original vaccine, with the exception of the primary and secondary antibodies used in the flow 
cytometry analysis. To show that the method is suitable for its intended purpose, its performance was 
evaluated against a set of defined acceptance criteria for specificity and detection limit. Additional 
method characteristics including robustness, intermediate precision and reproducibility were also 
evaluated as part of the validation. Intermediate precision was determined for Biotherapeutics 
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Analytical Research and Development lab, which includes two locations 
(Andover and Chesterfield).  Reproducibility was determined across all labs involved in the validation 
exercise. Based on the data provided, this method is considered validated at the laboratories that 
participated in the execution of the validation: BTx PharmSci ARD-BIT (Bioassay and Impurity Testing) 
Andover, MA, USA, BTx PharmSci ARD-BIT (Bioassay and Impurity Testing) Chesterfield, MO, USA, 
Pfizer Global Supply (PGS)-Quality Control (QC) in Grange Castle (GC), Ireland, PGS-QC in Andover 
(AND), MA, USA. and BioNTech Innovative Manufacturing Services GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany. 
Batch analysis data for the bivalent vaccine finished product have been provided for one confirmatory 
commercial scale batch (GA2789), one commercial scale batch (GC3889) and two supportive batches 
(22-DP-01012 - initial supportive clinical product lot (Pfizer Andover) and a confirmatory finished 
product lot (GC3898 – commercial scale, (Pfizer, Puurs)). All results met the acceptance criteria at the 
time of release. In addition, stability studies have been initiated for the supportive batch 22-DP-01012 
and for the confirmatory commercial scale batch GA2789. This is found acceptable Reference standards 
or materials (CTD module 3.2.P.6) 
The active substance reference material detailed in Section 3.2.S.5.1 is also used for the finished 
product. Reference material for the lipids (ALC-0315, ALC-0159, DSPC and cholesterol) is identical to 
the original approved Tris/Sucrose finished product. This is found acceptable. 
Container closure system (CTD module 3.2.P.7) 
The container closure system is the same as for the original Tris/Sucrose vaccine. No new information 
is provided. The bivalent vaccine is filled in type 1 borosilicate glass or aluminosilicate glass vials with 
bromobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium vial seal. 
Stability (CTD module 3.2.P.8) 
The proposed shelf-life for the bivalent vaccine finished product is 12 months when stored at the 
recommended storage temperature of -90 to -60 °C, including short term storage at 5 ± 3°C for up to 
10 weeks (within the 12-month shelf-life). 
The proposed shelf-life is based on the shelf-life for the original Tris/sucrose finished product, which is 
based on stability data obtained at the intended storage condition (-90 to -60 °C) as well as the 
accelerated storage conditions (-20 ± 5°C and 5 ± 3°C) during primary stability studies. Up to 2 
months of stability data are available for the bivalent drug product clinical (batch 22-DP-01012) and 
the confirmatory batch (batch GA2789) at the intended storage condition (-90 to -60 °C) as well as at 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022

the accelerated storage conditions (-20 ± 5°C and the 5 ± 3°C). These stability studies are currently 
on-going and data from these studies will be used to confirm the shelf shelf-life of the bivalent finished 
product. The original Tris/sucrose studies are also on-going and will be used to extend the shelf life 
based on the acceptability of the data. 
This approach to extrapolate the shelf-life from the original vaccine to the bivalent vaccine finished 
product is found acceptable since comparability has previously been acceptably demonstrated for a 
number of various comparisons of Comirnaty finished product such as between clinical and commercial 
scale original finished product, between various manufacturing sites and between the PBS/sucrose 
finished product and the Tris/sucrose finished product. Comparability has been demonstrated via 
comprehensive studies including both release testing and extended characterization testing. Due to the 
application of the same formulation, manufacturing process, and the use of the same manufacturing 
sites as the original finished product, extensive prior experience is leveraged for the bivalent finished 
product and comparability previously convincingly proven and concluded. 
Therefore, it is agreed to the proposed shelf-life for the bivalent vaccine finished product of 12 months 
when stored at the recommended storage temperature of -90 to -60 °C, including a short-term storage 
at 5 ± 3°C for up to 10 weeks (within the 12-month shelf-life). This is in-line with the wording in 
section 6.3 in the SmPC. 
Post-approval, a minimum of one lot of BNT162b2 Tris/Sucrose finished product will be enrolled in the 
commercial stability program at the long-term storage condition of -90 to -60 °C each year that 
finished product is manufactured.

3.5 Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
3.6 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
3.7 Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The expressed protein size for BNT162b2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) DS is evaluated by western blot. 
The Applicant claims that the protein size is consistent with the expected size of the translated 
protein. However, the theoretical protein sizes of the mature protein and variants thereof are

EMA/890789/2022 
Page 18/142 
 
 
 
 
not presented in the dossier. This information should be provided, and the bands observed by 
WB  should  be  assigned.  In  addition,  the  antibody  used  for  western  blot  should  be  further 
described, i.e., it should be stated if it targets the S1 or S2 domain of the protein. The dossier 
should be updated accordingly. 
2.  The  MAH  should  reassess  and  optimise  the  proposed  specification  for  the  RNA  ratio,  when  a 
sufficient number of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Wildtype and Omicron) Finished Product batches have 
been manufactured. 
4.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Phase 1/2/3 Study C4591001 is the pivotal study for the approval of the BNT162b2 vaccine against 
COVID-19 in healthy individuals ≥12 years of age. The study was initiated in April 2020 and has been 
amended several times since then. Study C4591031 was designed to evaluate BNT162b2 boosting 
strategies across different populations of participants (e.g., age groups) included in the C4591001 
study. The study is divided in several sub-studies.  
In Substudy D, the BNT162b2 OMI dose was 30 µg, i.e. the same dose as for the initially approved 
monovalent vaccine (original strain). A higher dose (60 µg) of the vaccine was also evaluated in 
C4591031 Substudy E. The bivalent formulation was tested in two different doses: Original/Omicron BA.1 
15/15 µg or 30/30 µg of each variant.  
The present submission provides new clinical data in approximately 1840 participants >55 years of 
age from the ongoing Study C4591031 Substudy E (BNT162b2-experienced participants), including 
safety and immunogenicity data up to 1 month after receipt of a single dose (Dose 4) of Original 
(30 μg or 60 μg), monovalent Omicron BA.1 (30 μg or 60 μg), or bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 
(15/15 μg or 30/30 μg), as described in the figure below.

The present submission also includes clinical data from approximately 640 participants ≥18 to 
≤55 years of age from the ongoing Study C4591031, Substudy D (Cohort 2: BNT162b2-experienced 
participants), including safety and immunogenicity to 1 month after receipt of an additional booster 
(fourth) dose of an Omicron variant specific vaccine, BNT162b2 OMI 30-µg, see figure below.

Additional descriptive analyses from Substudy E were performed to further characterize BA.4/BA.5 
neutralization responses following a booster (fourth) dose of the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 
µg compared to the authorised vaccine (Original 30 µg). An unvalidated fluorescent focus reduction 
neutralization test (FFRNT) was used to determine Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralizing titers 
among BNT162b2-experienced adults >55 years of age who received a booster (Dose 4) of either 
Original 30 µg or bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg in C4591031 Substudy E (Expanded 
Cohort).  
A total of 100 participants (20 participants with baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive status and 
80 participants with baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative status) were randomly selected from each vaccine 
group in the expanded cohort for the evaluable immunogenicity population Omicron BA.4/BA.5 
neutralization assay subset. 
The CHMP noted that the Novel SARS-CoV-2 human serological assay (the 384-well SARS-CoV-2 
microneutralisation) was utilised in support of the current application. This is based on real virus 
neutralisation and therefore suitable to detect the neutralising antibodies providing protection from 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by CHMP. The assay demonstrated dilutional linearity and 
precision that met predefined acceptance criteria. Samples with titers greater than the ULOQ may be 
pre-diluted in assay buffer before testing to yield titers within the validated assay range. The 
performance of the assay near the LOD is acceptable to the CHMP. The correlation with earlier method 
96-well SARS-CoV-2 mNeonGreen virus microneutralisation assay was demonstrated by testing. The 
WHO IS detection was demonstrated. Assay specificity was investigated by using non-related RSV-F 
protein which is acceptable to the CHMP in current settings. Assay sensitivity was ensured by testing 
samples with a wide range of antibody titres, long dilution series and established the LLOQ. The results 
documented in the revalidation report for the 384-well SARS-CoV-2 NT for the Wuhan and B1.1.529 
(Omicron) Variant supports that the assay is validated and suitable for its intended use in testing 
clinical, epidemiological, and non-clinical study samples, as endorsed by the CHMP.

data analyses included in this Substudy E interim report. Protocol Amendment 9 was approved on 03 
May 2022. 
Study participants 
This is a randomized, observer-blinded substudy of boosting study C4591031 to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of standard (30 µg) and high-dose (60 µg) BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 
OMI as well as a combination of the two (at 15 or 30 µg each for a total mRNA amount of 30 or 60 
µg), given as a single booster dose. Approximately 1920 participants >55 years of age and 990 
participants 18 to 55 years of age who have received 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 (30-µg doses), with 
the most recent dose being 5 to 12 months prior to randomization, were enrolled at investigator sites 
in the US only. Participants >55 years of age were randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:1 to receive 
BNT162b2 at 30 µg, BNT162b2 at 60 µg, BNT162b2 OMI at 30 µg, BNT162b2 OMI at 60 µg, a 
combination of BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 OMI at 30 µg (15 µg each), or a combination of BNT162b2 
and BNT162b2 OMI at 60 µg (30 µg each) at Visit 601 as a fourth dose.  
Participants must have met all of the general inclusion and exclusion criteria as specified for the master

Blinding 
Study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions were 
unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and 
participants, were blinded to study intervention assignments. In particular, the individuals who 
evaluated participant safety were blinded. 
The study intervention was to be administered in such a way as to ensure that the participants remain 
blinded. 
The sponsor (BioNTech) and sponsor agent (Pfizer Inc.) were unblinded to the study intervention 
allocation for the sentinel cohorts. For the expanded-enrolment part of the study, the majority of 
sponsor/Pfizer staff were blinded to study intervention allocation. All laboratory testing personnel 
performing serology assays remained blinded to study intervention assigned/received throughout the 
study. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity results for expanded cohort analyses were based on validated assays for 50% 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers on a newly developed 384-well assay platform (reference strain 
[USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.1) at before first 
study (Dose 4) vaccination and 1 month after study vaccination (Dose 4) with BNT162b2, 
BNT162b2 OMI or BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI reported as GMTs, GMRs, percentages/difference in 
percentages with seroresponse, GMFRs. The neutralizing titers between the 384-well platform and 
96-well platform are not comparable.

A non-validated assay (FFRNT) was used to obtain SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralization titers against 
wider range of Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5) in sentinel cohort and 
against Omicron BA4/BA5 strain from participants in the special immunogenicity subset, before 
study vaccination (Dose 4) and at 1-month post-Dose. The FFRNT is similar to the 50% plaque-
reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay which has been used to generate confirmatory data 
against the reference strain and other variants. The FFRNT assay has higher throughput and 
correlates well with the PRNT assay.  
Sample size 
The sample size in each group is based on consideration of an acceptable safety database. For the 
>55-year age group, a random sample of 230 participants will be selected from each group in the 
expanded-enrolment cohort as an immunogenicity subset to evaluate the primary and secondary 
immunogenicity objectives. Assuming a 35% non-evaluable or prior infection rate, approximately 150 
evaluable participants in each group will contribute to the primary immunogenicity evaluation.  
Superiority and Noninferiority of Anti-Omicron Immunogenicity Objectives 
For comparisons based on GMR, assuming common assay standard deviations of 1.05 in log scale 
based on data observed in the Phase 2 part of the C4591001 study for participants 56 years of age or 
older and adjusted for assay variability, if the true GMR is 1.5, with 150 evaluable participants, the 
study will have 91.5% power to demonstrate superiority. If the true GMR is 2.0, the study will have 
65.7% power to declare “super” superiority using a 1.5-fold margin. 
For comparisons based on seroresponse rate difference, if the seroresponse rate is 70% in the 
BNT162b2 OMI (30 μg or 60 μg) or bivalent BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 OMI (30 μg or 60 μg) group and 
55% in the BNT162b2 30 μg group, the study will have 94.9% power to demonstrate noninferiority 
using a 5% margin. 
Noninferiority of Anti–Reference Strain Immunogenicity Objectives 
For comparisons based on GMR, common assay standard deviations of 1.05 and a GMR of 1 are 
assumed for each comparison. With 150 evaluable participants and the stated assumptions for the 
GMR and standard deviation, the study has 90.9% power to demonstrate noninferiority based on the 
GMR using a 1.5-fold margin. 
Immunogenicity Endpoints and analysis methods 
Immunogenicity analyses were conducted based on the evaluable and all-available immunogenicity 
populations. Immunogenicity results were based on validated assays for 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 
titers against Omicron BA.1 and the reference strain from before study vaccination (Dose 4) to 1 
month after Dose of BNT162b2 (30 µg or 60 µg) BNT162b2 OMI (30 µg or 60 µg) or BNT162b2 +

Geometric mean titers (GMTs)

The primary immunogenicity objectives were to evaluate the superiority with respect to level of 
neutralizing titer and noninferiority with respect to seroresponse rates of the anti-Omicron BA.1 
immune response induced by a dose of BNT162b2 OMI (30 µg or 60 µg) or bivalent BNT162b2 + 
BNT162b2 OMI (30 µg or 60 µg) relative to the anti-Omicron BA.1 immune response elicited by a dose 
of BNT162b2 at 30 µg given as a fourth dose in BNT162b2-experienced participants >55 years of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 26/142 
 
 
 
 
The primary immunogenicity analysis included individuals without serological or virological evidence of 
past SARS CoV 2 infection up to 1 month after study vaccination (Dose 4).  
Statistical methods 
Superiority and Noninferiority of Anti-Omicron BA.1 Immune Responses Analyses: 
GMR: The primary analysis approach for GMR was unadjusted GMR calculated as the mean of the 
difference of logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the mean. Two-sided 95% 
CIs were obtained by calculating CIs using Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference on the 
logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidence limits.  
As sensitivity approach, the model-based GMR and associated 95% CI was calculated by 
exponentiating the difference in LS means and the corresponding CIs based on analysis of 
logarithmically transformed assay results using a linear regression model with terms of baseline assay 
results (log scale) and vaccine group. 
Simple superiority with respect to level of neutralizing titer of anti-Omicron BA.1 immune response 
would be declared if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is >1 and “super” superiority 
for GMR would be established if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is >1.5, after 
adjustment for multiplicity.  
Seroresponse: defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before the first dose of study 
vaccination). If the baseline measurement was below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥4 × 
LLOQ was considered seroresponse. The exact 95% CI for percentage of participants with 
seroresponse for each vaccine group was computed using the F distribution (Clopper-Pearson method). 
The primary approach to calculate difference in percentages and the associated 2 sided 95% CI was 
using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.  
As sensitivity approach, the difference in seroresponse rate between 2 vaccine groups and the 
associated 95% CI was calculated using Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by baseline assay 
result category (<median, ≥median). 
Noninferiority with respect to seroresponse rate of the anti-Omicron BA.1 immune response would be 
declared if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with 
seroresponse is >-5%, after adjustment for multiplicity. 
Noninferiority of Anti–Reference Strain Immune Responses Analyses: 
The secondary immunogenicity objectives on anti–reference strain immune responses were to assess 
the noninferiority of the anti–reference strain immune response induced by a dose of bivalent 
BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 OMI (30 µg or 60 µg) relative to the anti–reference strain immune response 
elicited by a dose of BNT162b2 at 30 µg given as a fourth dose in BNT162b2-experienced participants 
>55 years of age.  
Noninferiority of anti-reference strain immune response will be declared if the lower limit of the 2-sided 
95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 (1.5-fold criterion) and the point estimate of the GMR is 
≥0.8, after adjustment for multiplicity. 
Additional Analyses: 
GMT: calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the logarithm transformation and then 
exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale. Two-sided 95% CIs will be obtained 
by taking log transforms of assay results, calculating the 95% CI with reference to Student’s t-
distribution, and then exponentiating the confidence limits.  
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 27/142 
 
 
 
 
GMFR: calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (later time 
point minus earlier time point) and exponentiating the mean. The associated 2-sided 95% CIs will be 
obtained by constructing CIs using Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference on the logarithm 
scale and exponentiating the confidence limits. 
Subgroup analyses of immunogenicity were conducted based on demographic characteristics (age 
group, sex, race, ethnicity) and SARS-CoV-2 baseline status (positive or negative). 
Analysis sets: 
Enrolled: All participants who have a signed ICD. 
Randomized/assigned: All participants who are assigned a randomization number in the IWR 
system. 
Evaluable Immunogenicity: All eligible randomized/assigned participants who receive the study 
intervention to which they are randomized or assigned, have a valid and determinate immunogenicity 
result from the blood sample collected within 28-42 days after the study vaccination, and have no 
other important protocol deviations as determined by the clinician. 
All-available immunogenicity: All randomized/assigned participants who receive the study 
intervention with a valid and determinate immunogenicity result after vaccination. 
Safety: All participants who receive the study intervention. 
Multiplicity Adjustment 
Multiple primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives in this study are being assessed in a 
sequential order as listed below using a 1-sided alpha of 0.025. Comparisons are made with the 
reference vaccine BNT162b2 30 µg.

For objectives involving 2 hypotheses, hypotheses based on GMR and seroresponse rate difference are 
assessed sequentially in the order as stated. Both hypotheses within the objective must be established 
before assessing the next objective in the sequence. Therefore, the overall type I error is fully 
controlled.

4.1.2 Results 
Immunogenicity Population Characteristics – C4591031 Substudy E (Expanded Cohort) 
A random sample of 230 participants selected from each group in the expanded-enrolment cohort 
constituted the immunogenicity subset to evaluate the primary and secondary immunogenicity 
objectives (Table 3).  
Table 3.  Immunogenicity Populations – Expended Cohort – Immunogenicity Subset – Participants>55 
Years Age 
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Overall, most participants in the expanded cohort safety population were White (86.6%), with 5.5% 
Asian participants, 6.3% Black or African American participants, and other racial groups comprising 
≤1.1% each. There were 14.9% Hispanic/Latino participants. 
The median age at the time of study vaccination was 67.0 years, and 49.5% of participants were 
male. 
Obese participants made up 35.6% of the expanded cohort. In total, 232 (12.6%) participants had 
baseline positive status for evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. The median time from the 
first booster dose of BNT162b2 (received prior to the study C4591031 Substudy E) was 6.3 months.

Extended cohort to study responses to Omicron strain BA.4/BA.5 
A total of 100 participants (20 participants with baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive status and 
80 participants with baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative status) were randomly selected from each vaccine 
group in the expanded cohort for the evaluable immunogenicity population Omicron BA.4/BA.5 
neutralization assay subset. Demographic characteristics for participants in this subset were similar 
between the two vaccine groups.  
Immunogenicity Population- Sentinel cohort 
In total, all 120 participants >55 years of age in the sentinel cohort were randomized, received 
vaccination, and completed the 1-month post-vaccination visit. No participant in the sentinel cohort 
withdrew from the study. The median time from the first booster dose of BNT162b2 (received prior to 
the study C4591031 Substudy E) was 8.0 months. 
Demographic characteristics for the sentinel cohort immunogenicity populations (evaluable 
immunogenicity and all-available immunogenicity population) were generally similar to those observed 
for the safety population. 
Immunogenicity Analyses: Expanded Cohort – Participants >55 Years of Age 
Superiority and Noninferiority Objectives of Anti-Omicron BA.1 Immune Responses 
The primary immunogenicity objectives were to assess the superiority with respect to level of 
neutralizing titer and noninferiority with respect to seroresponse rate of the anti-Omicron immune 
response induced by a dose of BNT162b2 OMI (30 μg or 60 μg) or bivalent BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 
OMI (30 μg or 60 μg) relative to the anti-Omicron immune response elicited by a dose of BNT162b2 at 
30 μg given as a fourth dose in BNT162b2- experienced participants >55 years of age. 
GMR of Omicron BA.1 Neutralizing Titers 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after 
study vaccination, GMRs for the BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg group and BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg to BNT162b2 
30 µg group (GMR) was 2.23 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.65, 3.00) and 3.15 (2-sided 95% CI: 2.38, 4.16), 
respectively (Table 12). 
GMRs for the two bivalent vaccine groups BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg and BNT162b2 + 
BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg to BNT162b2 30 µg group was 1.56 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.17, 2.08) and 1.97 (2-
sided 95% CI: 1.45, 2.68), respectively (Table 5).

Subset – Participants>55 years of Age – Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
GMRs from the sensitivity analysis using linear regression model with terms of baseline assay results 
(log scale) and vaccine group are similar to the unadjusted GMR. GMR reported in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population with or without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after study 
vaccination was similar. 
Simple superiority of BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg, bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg, and bivalent 
BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 15+15 µg to BNT162b2 30 µg (reference vaccine) were met, as the lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >1 for each of the three comparisons.  
As the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >1.5, “super” superiority of BNT162b2 OMI 60 
µg to BNT162b2 30 µg for the Omicron variant was achieved based on the prespecified criterion. 
The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was <1.5, therefore, “super” superiority of BNT162b2 
+ BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg and BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg to BNT162b2 30 µg for the Omicron 
variant was not achieved.   
Hypotheses for monovalent BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg were to be tested sequentially after “super” 
superiority of bivalent vaccine groups. Since “super” superiority of bivalent vaccine groups was not 
achieved, all hypotheses (superiority in GMR and noninferiority in seroresponse rate for Omicron 
response) for BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg cannot be formally tested. Although not formally claimed due to 
multiplicity, monovalent Omicron-modified vaccine BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg also had GMR and lower 
bound of 95% CI (>1.5) consistent with super superiority criterion. 
Seroresponse Rate to Omicron BA.1 Strain 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after 
study vaccination, majority in each arm, achieved seroresponse to Omicron variant at 1 month after 
the study vaccination.  
Assessment report

Page 32/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rates was greater than the 
prespecified margin of -5% for noninferiority for all Omicron-modified vaccine groups evaluated 
(monovalent and bivalent). The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI was greater than 0%, suggesting 
higher seroresponse to Omicron variant compared to BNT162b2 30 µg recipients. 
Difference in seroresponse rate from the sensitivity analysis stratified by baseline assay result category 
are similar to the unadjusted results. Difference in seroresponse rate reported in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population with or without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after study 
vaccination was similar. 
Noninferiority based on seroresponse for BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg, bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 
60 µg, and bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg to BNT162b2 30 µg were met, as the lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is >-5% 
for each of the three comparisons. 
Although not formally claimed due to multiplicity, monovalent Omicron-modified vaccine BNT162b2 
OMI 30 µg also had lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants 
with seroresponse (>-5%) consistent with noninferiority criterion.

Noninferiority of Anti-Reference Strain Immune Responses 
The noninferiority immunogenicity objectives on anti–reference strain immune responses were to 
assess the noninferiority of the anti–reference strain immune response induced by a dose of bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA1 (15/15 μg or 30/30 μg) relative to the anti–reference strain immune response 
elicited by a dose of Original at 30 μg given as a fourth dose in Original Comirnaty 30 μg -experienced 
participants >55 years of age. 
GMR of Reference Strain Neutralizing Titers 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after 
study vaccination, GMRs for the two bivalent vaccine groups 15/15 µg and 30/30 µg to Original 30 µg 
group was 0.99 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.82, 1.20) and 1.30 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.07, 1.58), respectively.  
Noninferiority based on the GMR for reference strain response was met by both bivalent vaccine 
groups as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 (1.5-fold criterion). 
GMRs from the sensitivity analysis using linear regression model with terms of baseline assay results 
(log scale) and vaccine group are similar to the unadjusted GMR. GMR reported in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population with or without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after study 
vaccination and participants in the all-available population were similar.

Omicron Neutralizing Titers 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of infection up to 1 month post-dose, 
GMTs were substantially elevated over levels observed before study vaccination for Omicron BA.1, 
across all groups, with monovalent Omicron BA1 30 µg and 60 µg groups and bivalent 30/30 µg group 
showing the best responses against Omicron BA.1 (Table 7). 
Reference Strain Neutralizing Titers 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of infection up to 1 month post-dose, 
GMTS were substantially elevated over levels observed before study vaccination for the reference 
strain, across all vaccine groups.

Seroresponse to Omicron - or Reference-Strain 
In the expanded cohort of participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
study vaccination, the proportion of participants who achieved seroresponse in SARS-CoV-2 50% 
neutralizing titers at 1 month post-Dose for the Omicron variant was highest for the monovalent 
Omicron BA1. 30 µg, 60 µg and bivalent Original/Omicron BA1.15/15 µg groups (76.7%, 86.1% and 
71.6%, respectively). 
The proportion of participants who achieved seroresponse in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers at 1 
month post-Dose for the reference strain were generally higher in the 60 µg groups than in the 
respective 30 µg groups.

Subgroup Analyses 
Overall, for all BNT162b2, BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 OMI + BNT162b2 recipients, there were no 
clinically meaningful differences between subgroups for neutralizing GMTs and seroresponse rates, for 
the Omicron variant and reference strain except for baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. As several subgroups 
(eg, younger age group, Black or African American, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, SARS-CoV-2 baseline 
positive or NAAT positive participants) included a limited number of participants, their results should 
be interpreted with caution. 
•  GMTs at 1 month-post-Dose were substantially higher for participants who were baseline 
positive compared to those who were baseline negative for SARS-CoV-2.  
•  GMFRs at 1 month-post-Dose were generally lower for participants who were baseline positive 
as the baseline titers compared to those who were baseline negative for SARS-CoV-2. 
•  Seroresponse rates at 1 month-post-Dose were generally lower for participants who were 
baseline positive compared to those who were baseline negative for SARS-CoV-2. 
Surveillance of COVID-19 Cases – Expanded Cohort 
COVID-19 Cases up to Data Cutoff Date 
In the expanded cohort, cases in a total of 30 participants across all vaccine groups were accrued up to 
the data cutoff date of 16 May 2022. 
Original 30 µg and 60 µg groups: 7 and 6 cases, respectively 
Omicron BA1. 30 µg and 60 µg groups: 7 and 3 cases, respectively 
Original/BA1. 15/15 µg and 30/30 µg groups: 1 and 6 cases, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 38/142 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of cases (n=29) met both protocol-defined and CDC defined criteria for COVID-19 
disease. One case in the BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg group met only the CDC-defined criteria 
(Appendix 16.2.8.1). The reported signs and symptoms were generally similar for participants in the 
BNT162b2, BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI groups, and the most commonly reported 
were new or increased cough (n=19) and sore throat (n=19). Few participants reported >3 concurrent 
signs and symptoms (n=8). No cases meeting severe criteria per the FDA or CDC definition were 
observed in any of the vaccine groups. 
Immunogenicity results for the expanded BA4/ BA5 cohort 
GMT 
Overall, the observed Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs at 1 month post-Dose were numerically 
slightly higher for the bivalent Original/Omicron BA1. 15/15 µg group compared to Original 30 µg 
group (167.4 vs 155.1).  
GMTs at pre-Dose and 1 month-post-Dose were generally higher for participants who were baseline 
seropositive compared to those who were baseline seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 10).

Immunogenicity Results: Sentinel Cohort 
GMTs for Omicron, Reference Strain, and Delta Variants (Sentinel Cohort) 
Among participants >55 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the observed GMT at 1-month post-dose against Omicron variants (BA.1, 
BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5) were the lowest for the monovalent BNT16b2 OMI 30 µg and the 
BNT162b2 30 µg groups (Table 13). All bivalent vaccine groups showed in general higher 
neutralization titers to Omicron variants. Omicron BA.4/BA.5 was the least effectively neutralized 
variant for all vaccine groups, though titers were slightly higher in the Omicron-modified vaccine 
groups compared to the prototype vaccine. Similar results were observed for participants with and 
without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the evaluable immunogenicity population and 
participants in the all-available immunogenicity population.

For sentinel cohort participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of 
infection up to 1 month after study vaccination, GMTs at 1-month post-dose were substantially 
elevated over levels observed before study vaccination for Omicron BA.1, reference strain and Delta 
across all groups, with Omicron BA1. 60 µg group and Original/ Omicron BA1. 15/15 µg and 30/30 µg 
groups showing the best responses against Omicron BA.1 (Table 14).

GMFRs for Omicron BA.1, Reference Strain, and Delta Variants (Sentinel Cohort) 
For sentinel cohort participants in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of 
infection up to 1 month after study vaccination, the GMFRs from before study vaccination to 1 month 
post-Dose ranged from 7.6 to 19.0 for the Omicron BA.1 variant, 4.3 to 8.8 for reference strain and 
4.7 to 11.1 for the Delta variant. GMFRs were less consistent across vaccine groups, potentially a 
reflection of the small sample size in the sentinel groups.  
Seroresponse to Omicron BA.1, Reference Strain, and Delta Variants (Sentinel Cohort) 
For sentinel cohort participants in evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of 
infection up to 1 month after study vaccination, the proportion of participants achieving seroresponse 
to Omicron BA.1, reference strain, and Delta at 1 month post-Dose were generally similar across all 
vaccine groups, with the Omicron BA1. 30 µg slightly lower for the reference strain and Delta variant, 
and the Original/ Omicron BA1. 15/15 µg group slightly lower for the Delta variant.

Additional descriptive analyses from Substudy E were performed to further characterize BA.2.75 
neutralization responses following a booster (fourth) dose of bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1-15/15 µg 
compared to the prototype vaccine (BNT162b2 30 µg). A fluorescent focus reduction neutralization test 
(FFRNT) was used to determine Omicron BA.2.75-specific neutralizing titers in a small subset of 
C4591031 Substudy E (Expanded Cohort: participants >55 years of age). 
The evaluable immunogenicity population for the Omicron BA.2.75 neutralization assay subset included

Immunogenicity conclusions for Expanded Cohort 
Overall, for the primary and secondary immunogenicity analyses for the Omicron variant, BNT162b2 
OMI 30 µg and 60 µg and the BNT162b2 +BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg and 60 µg groups met the 
prespecified criteria for superiority with respect to GMR and noninferiority with respect to 
seroresponse rate when compared to BNT162b2 30 µg group, when administered to BNT162b2-
experienced participants as fourth dose. 
• 
‘Simple’ superiority of BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg, bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg, and 
bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg to BNT162b2 30 µg were met, as the lower bound of 
the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >1 for each of the three comparisons. 
•  Noninferiority based on seroresponse for BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg, bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 
OMI 60 µg, and bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg to BNT162b2 30 µg were met, as 
the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with 
seroresponse is >-5% for each of the three comparisons. Although not formally claimed due to 
multiplicity, monovalent Omicron-modified vaccine BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg also had lower limit of 
the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse (>-5%) 
consistent with noninferiority criterion. 
• 
“Super” superiority of BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg to BNT162b2 30 µg for the Omicron variant was 
achieved based on the prespecified criterion, as the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for GMR 
was >1.5. Although not formally claimed due to multiplicity, monovalent Omicron-modified 
vaccine BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg also had GMR and lower bound of 95% CI (>1.5) consistent with 
the super superiority criterion. 
•  Noninferiority for reference strain based on the GMR was met in both bivalent vaccine groups 
(BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg and 60 µg) as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
GMR is greater than 0.67 (1.5-fold criterion). 
•  Overall, for all BNT162b2, BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 OMI + BNT162b2 recipients, there 
were no clinically meaningful differences between subgroups for neutralizing GMTs and 
seroresponse rates, for the Omicron variant except for baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. GMTs at 1

month-post-Dose were substantially higher while seroresponse rates were generally lower for 
participants who were baseline positive compared to those who were baseline negative for 
SARS-CoV-2. 
•  GMTs at 1 month post-Dose were substantially elevated over levels observed before study 
vaccination for Omicron BA.1, across all groups, with monovalent BNT162b2 OMI 30- and 60 µg 
and bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 30- and 60 µg showing the best responses against 
Omicron BA.1. GMFRs were higher for the monovalent BNT162b2 OMI and the bivalent Omicron-
modified vaccine groups compared with the BNT162b2 groups. 
•  GMTs at 1 month post-Dose were substantially elevated over levels observed before study 
vaccination for the reference strain, across all groups; BNT162b2, BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 
+ BNT162b2 OMI 60 µg elicited higher responses against the reference strain. GMFRs for the 
reference strain were similar across all vaccine groups. 
•  Overall, for participants >55 years of age in the expanded group, few COVID-19 cases accrued 
up to the data cutoff date of 16 May 2022. The study was not powered to assess differences 
across vaccine groups on COVID-19 cases. 
Sentinel Cohort 
•  Among participants >55 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 was the least effectively neutralized 
variant for all vaccine groups, though titers were slightly higher in the Omicron-modified vaccine 
groups compared to the prototype vaccine. 
•  All bivalent vaccine groups showed in general higher neutralization titers to Omicron variants. 
GMTs at 1-month post-Dose were substantially elevated over levels observed before study 
vaccination for Omicron BA.1, reference strain and Delta across all groups, with monovalent 60 
µg Omicron and bivalent Omicron-modified vaccines showing the best responses against 
Omicron BA.1. GMTs for reference strain and Delta were well preserved across all Omicron-
modified vaccine groups. 
•  Seroresponse was generally similar across all groups, with the BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg slightly 
lower for the reference strain and Delta variant, and the BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI 30 group 
slightly lower for the Delta variant. GMFRs were less consistent across vaccine groups, 
potentially a reflection of the small sample size in the sentinel groups.

Conduct of the study 
C4591031 Protocol Amendment 8 was the effective protocol version at the time of the data cutoff and 
data analyses included in this Substudy D interim report for Cohort 2. 
Study participants 
Participants in Cohort 2 were enrolled from Study C4591001 and C4591031 Substudy A and 
completed a 2-dose primary series and received a single booster (third) dose of BNT162b2, with 
their last dose 90 to 180 days prior to randomization. Approximately 600 participants were to be

randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive a fourth dose (ie, first study vaccination booster) of either 
BNT162b2 or BNT162b2 OMI at Visit 401. Participants were offered a dose of BNT162b2 OMI at 
Visit 404 (3-month follow-up). Randomization was stratified by age (18-30, 31-55 years of age). 
Cohort 2 was observer-blinded. 
Participants in C4591031 Substudy D were enrolled at sites in the US and South Africa, the latter 
where the new SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.1.529, was first identified. The sample size for Groups 3 and 4 
(Cohort 2) was based on consideration of an acceptable safety database and power for the primary and 
secondary immunogenicity objectives

a Results included in this interim CSR are for BNT162b2-experienced participants given a fourth dose of BNT162b2 OMI or

b Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before the first dose of study vaccination). If the baseline 
measurement is below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥4 × LLOQ is considered seroresponse. 
c This subset of participants will not contribute to the assessment of primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives. 
d Results included in this interim CSR are up to the data cutoff date, which represents up to at least 1 month of follow-up after 
fourth dose. 
AE results up to the data cutoff date are also included. 
Sample size 
The sample size for Groups 3 and 4 of Cohort 2 was based on consideration of an acceptable safety 
database and power for the primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives. For each group, a 
subset of 30 participants out of 300 participants total was to be selected as a sentinel group for 
separate assessment of immune response defined in an exploratory objective. The subset was to 
comprise the first 30 participants from each group with immunogenicity samples received by the 
central laboratory. A random sample of 175 participants from each of Groups 3 and 4 selected from 
the remaining approximately 270 participants was used for evaluation of the primary and 
secondary immunogenicity objectives in each group. 
For comparisons based on GMR, common assay standard deviations at 1 month after the third or 
fourth dose or 1 month after Dose 2 in log scale is assumed to be 0.93 based on data observed in 
the C4591001 study. If the true GMR of Omicron-neutralizing titer after BNT162b2 OMI to after 
BNT162b2 is 1.5, 114 evaluable participants per group would provide 90.6% power to declare 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022

superiority. If the true GMR is 2.5, the study would have 98.5% power to declare “super” 
superiority using a 1.5-fold margin. For comparisons based on seroresponse rate difference, if the 
seroresponse rate is 80% in the BNT162b2 OMI group and 60% in the BNT162b2 group, the study 
had 98.6% power to demonstrate noninferiority using a 5% margin. 
Randomisation 
For Cohort 2, participants received 1 dose of study intervention as allocated by the IRT at Visit 401. 
Group 3 and Group 4 participants could receive a dose of BNT162b2 OMI at Visit 404. 
Blinding 
In Cohort 2, the study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study 
interventions were unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, 
investigator staff, and participants, were blinded to study intervention assignments. In particular, 
the individuals who evaluated participant safety were blinded. 
The majority of sponsor/Pfizer staff were blinded to study intervention allocation for  Cohort 2. All 
laboratory testing personnel performing serology assays remained blinded to study intervention 
assigned/received throughout the study. 
Per protocol, participants in Cohort 2 were to be unblinded to confirm the vaccine received once 
they complete Visit 404 (3 months after Substudy D Vaccination 1). 
Immunogenicity evaluation 
Immunogenicity evaluation for substudy D was identical as described for substudy E. Shortly, 
Immunogenicity results for non-sentinel analyses were based on validated assays for 50% SARS-
CoV-2 neutralizing titers on a newly developed 384-well assay platform (reference strain [USA-
WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.1) at before first study 
(Dose 4) vaccination and 1 month after first study (Dose 4) vaccination with BNT162b2 OMI or 
BNT162b2, reported as GMTs, GMRs, percentages/difference in percentages with seroresponse, 
GMFRs.  
A non-validated assay (FFRNT) was used to obtain sentinel SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralization titers 
from a subset of 60 participants in Groups 3 and 4 of Cohort 2, before Dose 4 and at 1 month post-
Dose 4.  
Immunogenicity Endpoints and analysis methods 
Immunogenicity analyses were conducted based on the evaluable and all-available immunogenicity 
populations. Immunogenicity results were based on validated assays for 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 
titers from before Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 of BNT162b2 OMI or BNT162b2, reported as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Geometric mean titers (GMTs)  
Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of GMTs (BNT162b2 OMI / BNT162b2) 
Percentages/difference in percentages with seroresponse (BNT162b2 OMI – BNT162b2) 
Geometric mean-fold rises (GMFRs) in titers  
A supportive FFRNT assay was used to obtain sentinel Omicron neutralization titers from a subset of 
participants in Study C4591031 Substudy D.  
The primary immunogenicity objective for Cohort 2 (BNT162b2 OMI vs BNT162b2) was to demonstrate 
superiority with respect to level of neutralizing titer and noninferiority with respect to seroresponse 
rate of the anti-Omicron immune response after 1 dose of BNT162b2 OMI compared to after 1 dose of 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 49/142 
 
 
 
 
BNT162b2 given as the fourth dose in participants without serological or virological evidence of past 
SARS CoV 2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 4. Results were reported as a GMR of the SARS CoV-2 
50% neutralizing titers and the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse, at 1 month 
after Dose 4, as described below. 
Statistical methods 
Superiority analyses: 
GMR: The GMR was calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay 
results and exponentiating the mean. Two-sided 95% CIs were obtained by calculating CIs using 
Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference on the logarithmically transformed assay results and 
exponentiating the confidence limits.  
Superiority based on GMR was declared if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater 
than >1. 
The secondary objective of “super” superiority was evaluated using a 1.5-fold margin for GMR. “Super” 
superiority for GMR was established if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is >1.5. 
Noninferiority analyses: 
Seroresponse: defined as achieving a ≥4-fold increase in SARS CoV-2 neutralizing titers over pre-
booster (ie, pre-Dose 4) titers. The difference in percentages and the associated 2 sided 95% CI 
calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method were provided. 
Noninferiority based on seroresponse rate was declared if the lower bound of the 2 sided 95% CI for 
the difference in seroresponse rate was greater than -5%. 
Additional analyses: 
GMT: calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the logarithm transformation and then 
exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale. Two-sided 95% Cis will be obtained 
by taking log transforms of assay results, calculating the 95% CI with reference to Student’s t-
distribution, and then exponentiating the confidence limits. 
GMFR: calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (later 
time point minus earlier time point) and exponentiating the mean. The associated 2 sided 95% CIs will 
be obtained by constructing CIs using Student’s t distribution for the mean difference on the logarithm 
scale and exponentiating the confidence limits. 
Subgroup analyses of immunogenicity were conducted based on demographic characteristics (age, sex, 
race, ethnicity) and SARS-CoV-2 baseline status (positive or negative). 
Analysis sets 
Enrolled: All participants who have a signed ICD. 
Randomized/assigned: All participants who are assigned a randomization number in the IWR 
system. 
Evaluable immunogenicity: All eligible randomized/assigned participants who receive the first study 
intervention to which they are randomized (for Groups 1, 2b, 3, and 4) or receive 2 doses of study 
intervention to which they are randomized or assigned with Dose 2 received within 19 to 42 days after 
Dose 1 (for Groups 2 and 5), have a valid and determinate immunogenicity result from the blood 
sample collected within 28 to 42 days after the first study vaccination (for Groups 1, 2b, 3 and 4) or

within 28 to 42 days after the second study vaccination (for Groups 2 and 5), and have no other 
important protocol deviations as determined by the clinician. 
All-available immunogenicity: All randomized/assigned participants who receive at least 1 dose of 
the study intervention with a valid and determinate immunogenicity result after vaccination. 
Safety: All participants who receive at least 1 dose of the study intervention. 
Multiplicity: 
The 3 cohorts (2-dose BNT162b2-experienced, 3-dose BNT162b2-experienced, and COVID-19 vaccine–
naïve individuals) are different populations with different objectives. The 3 populations are included in 
the same study to improve operational efficiency. Therefore, no type I error adjustments was applied 
to between the immunogenicity assessments of the 3 populations. 
For Cohort 2 the objectives will be evaluated in sequential order as listed below using a 1-sided alpha 
of 0.025:

4.2.2 Results 
Immunogenicity populations 
Full expanded set 
The subset of 60 participants across both vaccine groups that comprised the sentinel group was 
not included in the full expanded set (to which 580 participants were randomized; Table 6). 
For the full expanded set, the evaluable immunogenicity population included 263 participants (92.6%) 
in the BNT162b2 OMI group and 280 participants (94.6%) in the BNT162b2 group. Exclusions from the 
evaluable immunogenicity population were generally balanced across vaccine groups; the most 
common reason for exclusion was participants not having at least 1 valid and determinate 
immunogenicity result within 28-42 days after first study (Dose 4) vaccination (3.4%). 
For the full expanded set, the evaluable immunogenicity population for participants without evidence of 
infection prior to 1 month after Dose 4 included a total of 436 participants: 208 participants (73.2%) in 
the BNT162b2 OMI group and 228 participants (77.0%) in the BNT162b2 group.

Baseline data 
Primary Immunogenicity Subset 
The primary immunogenicity subset comprised a random sampling of 175 participants from each 
vaccine group selected from the full expanded set. 
For the primary immunogenicity subset, the evaluable immunogenicity population included 168 
participants (96.0%) each in the BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 groups. Exclusions from the evaluable 
immunogenicity population were balanced across vaccine groups; the most common reason for 
exclusion was participants did not meet eligibility and randomization criteria (3.4%), which occurred in 
2.9% of BNT162b2 OMI participants vs 4.0% of BNT162b2 recipients. 
For the primary immunogenicity subset, the evaluable immunogenicity population for participants 
without evidence of infection prior to 1 month post-Dose 4 included a total of 273 participants: 132 
participants (75.4%) in the BNT162b2 OMI group and 141 participants (80.6%) in the BNT162b2 
group.

Table 20.  Immunogenicity Populations – Cohort 2 – Primary Immunogenicity Subset 
Full expanded set 
For the full expanded set, demographics of participants without evidence of infection prior to 1 month 
post-Dose 4 (N=436) in the evaluable immunogenicity population were similar in the BNT162b2 OMI 
and BNT162b2 groups (Table 21). This analysis population had similar demographics compared to the 
safety population. 
Most participants were White (73.9%), with 15.6% Asian participants, 5.0% Black or African 
American participants, 3.4% multiracial participants, and other racial groups comprising <1% each. 
There were 13.8% Hispanic/Latino participants. The median age at the time of study vaccination 
was 44 years, and 53.2% of participants were male. All (100%) study participants were enrolled in 
the US. 
Obese participants made up 37.8% of this analysis population. The median time from the first booster 
dose of BNT162b2 (received prior to C4591031 Substudy D) was 3.9 months. 
For the full expanded set, demographic characteristics for participants with or without evidence 
of infection prior to 1 month after first study (Dose 4) vaccination (evaluable immunogenicity

Superiority Analysis - GMR of Omicron-Neutralizing Titers in BNT162b2 OMI Dose 4 Recipients 
Compared to BNT162b2 Dose 4 Recipients 
In  the  primary immunogenicity subset  of  participants  without  prior  evidence  of  infection  up  to  1 
month  after  first  study  (Dose  4)  vaccination,  the  ratio  of  GMTs  for  the  BNT162b2  OMI  group  to 
BNT162b2 group (GMR) was 1.75 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.39, 2.22) (Table 22). 
The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >1, which meets the prespecified simple 
superiority criterion. Therefore, simple superiority of BNT162b2 OMI to BNT162b2 for the Omicron 
variant was achieved based on GMR at 1 month after Dose 4.

Noninferiority Analysis - Difference in Seroresponse Rates to Omicron Variant in BNT162b2 
OMI Dose 4 Recipients Compared to BNT162b2 Dose 4 Recipients 
In the primary immunogenicity subset of participants without prior evidence of infection up to 1 
month after first study (Dose 4) vaccination, 62.3% of participants in the BNT162b2 OMI group 
and 39.3% of participants in the BNT162b2 group achieved seroresponse to Omicron variant at 1 
month after the study vaccination. The difference in proportions of participants who achieved 
seroresponse to Omicron variant between the 2 vaccine groups was 23.0% (2-sided 95% CI: 
11.1%, 34.3%) (Table 23). 
Noninferiority of BNT162b2 OMI to BNT162b2 for the Omicron variant was achieved based on 
seroresponse rates at 1 month after Dose 4. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI was greater 
than 0%, suggesting higher seroresponse to Omicron variant in BNT162b2 OMI recipients than 
BNT162b2 recipients.

The full expanded set comprised Cohort 2 participants excluding the 60 participants across both 
vaccine groups included in the sentinel group. 
Immunogenicity evaluations presented for the full expanded set include descriptive summary of 
immune response to Omicron variant and reference strain for each vaccine group and post hoc 
analyses of GMR and difference in seroresponse between the 2 vaccine groups, corresponding to 
the primary immunogenicity analyses in the primary immunogenicity subset.

study (Dose 4) vaccination, the post hoc analysis of the ratio of GMTs for the  BNT162b2 OMI group 
to BNT162b2 group (GMR) was 1.96 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.62, 2.37) (Table 24), consistent with the 
results in the primary immunogenicity subset in which the simple superiority criterion (lower bound 
of the 2-sided 95% CI >1) was met. Furthermore, this would meet the “super” superiority criterion 
(lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI >1.5).

GMTs for Omicron Variant and Reference Strain 
In the full expanded set of participants without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after first 
study (Dose 4) vaccination, for both the BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 groups there was a 
substantial increase in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs for the Omicron (BA.1) variant and 
reference strains at 1 month post-Dose 4 compared to the pre-vaccination  baseline (Table 26, 
Figure 1, Figure 2). 
At 1 month post-Dose 4, for the Omicron variant, GMTs were higher for the BNT162b2 OMI group 
(2086.7; 2-sided 95% CI: 1812.7, 2402.0) than the BNT162b2 group (1063.2; 2-sided 95% CI: 
935.8, 1207.9) (Table 24). For the reference strain, GMTs were similar for the BNT162b2 OMI and 
BNT162b2 groups.

GMFRs for Omicron Variant and Reference Strain 
In the full expanded set of participants without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after first

Subgroup Analyses 
Overall, for all BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 OMI recipients, there were no clinically meaningful differences 
between subgroups for neutralizing GMTs and seroresponse rates, for the Omicron variant except for 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. As several subgroups (eg, younger age group, Black or African American, 
Asian, Hispanic/Latino, SARS-CoV-2 baseline positive or NAAT positive participants) included a limited 
number of participants, their results should be interpreted with caution. 
•  GMTs at 1-month post-Dose 4 for both BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 recipients were generally 
higher for participants who were baseline positive and the subset of those who were NAAT positive 
at baseline which, in light of the study timeframe, can be inferred to be an Omicron infection, 
compared to those who were baseline negative for SARS-CoV-2. 
•  GMFRs for both BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 recipients were generally higher for the participants 
in the subgroup for baseline positive by NAAT compared to those for participants who were 
baseline positive and baseline negative for SARS-CoV-2. 
•  Seroresponse rates at 1-month post-Dose 4 for both BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 recipients 
were generally higher for participants who were NAAT positive at baseline compared to those who 
were baseline positive or baseline negative for both Omicron variant and reference strain. 
Immunogenicity conclusions of Substudy D 
Overall, for the primary and secondary immunogenicity analyses for the Omicron variant, 
BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg met the pre-specified criteria for simple superiority with respect to GMR 
and noninferiority with respect to seroresponse rate when compared to BNT162b2 30 µg when 
administered as a fourth dose. 
Primary Immunogenicity Analyses - Superiority and Noninferiority – Primary Immunogenicity 
Subset 
In participants without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 4, for the Omicron (BA.1) 
variant: 
• 
The ratio of GMTs for the BNT162b2 OMI group to BNT162b2 group (GMR) was 1.75 (2-sided 95% 
CI: 1.39, 2.22). As the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >1, the simple superiority 
of BNT162b2 OMI to BNT162b2 for the Omicron variant was achieved based on GMR at 1 month 
after Dose 4. 
•  Seroresponse rates to the Omicron variant were 62.3% in the BNT162b2 OMI group and 39.3% in 
the BNT162b2 group, and the difference in proportions of participants who achieved seroresponse 
to Omicron variant between the BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 groups was 23.0% (2-sided 95% 
CI: 11.1%, 34.3%). As the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was greater than the 
prespecified margin of -5%, noninferiority of BNT162b2 OMI to BNT162b2 for the Omicron variant 
was achieved based on seroresponse rates at 1 month after Dose 4. The lower bound of the 2-
sided 95% CI was greater than 0%, suggesting higher seroresponse to Omicron variant in 
BNT162b2 OMI recipients than BNT162b2 recipients.

Secondary Immunogenicity Analysis – “Super” Superiority – Primary Immunogenicity Subset 
As shown for the superiority analysis, in the primary immunogenicity subset of participants without 
prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 4, the GMR (BNT162b2 OMI / BNT162b2) was 1.75 
(2-sided 95% CI: 1.39, 2.22). As the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was not >1.5, 
“super” superiority of BNT162b2 OMI to BNT162b2 for the Omicron variant was not achieved at 1 
month after Dose 4 based on the prespecified criterion. 
Descriptive Immunogenicity Analyses – Full Expanded Set 
Overall, immune responses to the Omicron variant and reference strain were elicited by BNT162b2 
OMI and BNT162b2 in the full expanded set; descriptive analyses for the Omicron variant were 
consistent with those in the primary immunogenicity subset. For both groups, analyses by age, 
sex, race, and ethnicity suggested no clinically meaningful differences between subgroups. For the 
Omicron variant and reference strains, for both vaccine groups the immune responses up to 1 
month after Dose 4 (GMTs, GMFRs, seroresponse rates) were generally higher for participants with 
baseline positive SARS-CoV-2 status compared to those with baseline negative status. 
In participants without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 4: 
•  The ratio of GMTs for the BNT162b2 OMI group to BNT162b2 group (GMR) for the Omicron 
variant was 1.96 (2-sided 95% CI: 1.62, 2.37), consistent with the results in the primary 
immunogenicity subset in which the simple superiority criterion (lower bound of the 2-sided 95% 
CI >1) was met. Furthermore, this would meet the “super” superiority criterion (lower bound of 
the 2-sided 95% CI >1.5). 
•  The difference in proportions of participants who achieved seroresponse to the Omicron variant 
between the BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 groups was 21.4% (2-sided 95% CI: 12.0%, 30.4%), 
similar to the results in the primary immunogenicity subset in which the noninferiority criterion 
(lower bound of the 2 sided 95% CI >-5%) was achieved. 
For both the BNT162b2 OMI and BNT162b2 groups, there was a substantial increase in SARS-CoV-2 
50% neutralizing GMTs for the Omicron variant and reference strains at  1 month post-Dose 4 
compared to the pre-vaccination baseline. For the Omicron variant GMTs were higher for the BNT162b2 
OMI group (2086.7; 2-sided 95% CI: 1812.7, 2402.0) than the BNT162b2 group (1063.2; 2-sided 
95% CI: 935.8, 1207.9). 
The GMFRs from Dose 4 to 1 month post-Dose 4 for the Omicron variant were higher for the BNT162b2 
OMI group (5.6; 2-sided 95% CI: 4.9, 6.4) than the BNT162b2 group (3.4; 2-sided 95% CI: 3.0, 3.8). 
The proportion of participants who achieved seroresponse in SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers at 1 
month post-Dose 4 for the Omicron variant was 61.7% (2-sided 95% CI: 54.6%, 68.3%) for the 
BNT162b2 OMI group and 40.3% (2-sided 95%CI: 33.8%, 47.0%) for the BNT162b2 group. 
4.3 Immunogenicity Discussion 
Background 
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has repeatedly evolved and mutated, originating several variants and causing 
new waves of infection. The variants have so far shown cross-reactivity with the original strain, which 
was the base for the currently approved vaccines. However, there is a concern that presently 
circulating virus variants are less cross-reactive with the original strain. The variant causing the latest 
waves of disease has been the Omicron variant, with several subvariants beginning with BA.1 and 
currently BA.5 being the most dominant in the EU. It is hypothesised that a booster vaccine based on a 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 62/142 
 
 
 
 
 
variant virus strain will result in broader immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In order to optimize vaccines, 
regulatory bodies (e.g. ICMRA) and the WHO have suggested that a bivalent vaccine including both 
original as well as an omicron variant may be desirable. 
The MAH has conducted clinical studies with variant vaccine mono- and bivalent (Original/Omicron 
BA.1) candidates including the mRNA transcribing Omicron variant S protein. 
This application concerns a booster dose with a bivalent original/Omicron (BA.1) vaccine, (BNT162b2 
Original 15 µg + BNT162b2 OMI 15 µg = “Original/Omicron BA.1” 15/15 µg), given ≥4 months after 
the third dose to subjects≥12 years of age.  
Clinical studies 
The application is based primarily on clinical data from Study C4591031 Substudy E, investigating the 
safety, tolerability, and immune responses of a fourth dose of bivalent vaccine (subjects had previously 
received three doses of the Original Comirnaty) in approximately 1840 older adult (>55 years of age) 
participants. Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15µg (30 µg) was compared to Original/Omicron BA.1 at 60 
µg; to monovalent Omicron BA.1 at 30 and 60 µg; and to monovalent Original at 30 and 60 µg. 
Supportive data are provided from Study C4591031 Substudy D investigating safety and 
immunogenicity of an investigational monovalent Omicron BA.1 vaccine where 640 subjects aged 18-
55 years (majority 30-55 years, 13% were 18-<30 years old) were randomized to receive either the 
monovalent Omicron BA.1 30µg (n=315) or the authorized Original 30µg (n=325) as a fourth dose. In 
this substudy also all subjects had previously received three doses of Original Comirnaty 30 µg. 
Both substudies had as its primary objective the investigation of the immunogenicity of different 
Omicron containing vaccine formulations as a fourth dose compared to a fourth dose of Original 
Comirnaty 30 µg.  
The primary endpoint of these studies was to show that the novel vaccine formulations, containing the 
Omicron strain, can induce superior immune responses to the Omicron BA.1 virus variant, and induce 
non-inferior response to the reference strain compared to Original Comirnaty 30 µg.  
There is currently no immunological correlate of protection established for COVID-19, and therefore 
the relevance of numerical titre differences, in terms of impact on protection against severe disease or 
any clinical disease, cannot be determined.  
The serological comparison is considered acceptable as efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical 
studies and neutralizing antibodies are considered an acceptable surrogate endpoint for efficacy. As 
stated above, it is assumed that efficacy against a new variant will be at least comparable and possibly 
superior, if superior levels of neutralizing antibodies are detected following booster with a variant 
vaccine compared to the original vaccine. The quantification of such incremental effects, however, will 
need to be based on real-world evidence, given that no randomised controlled trial of the variant-
adapted vaccine against the original vaccine is required, according to regulatory policy (ICMRA). 
Substudy E contained 6 study arms. In each arm approximately 230 individuals received either: 
1) BNT162b2 (Original) 30 µg 
2) BNT162b2 (Original) 60 µg 
3) BNT162b2 OMI (Omicron BA.1) 30 µg 
4) BNT162b2 OMI (Omicron BA.1) 60 µg 
5) bivalent BNT162b2 15 µg + BNT162b2 OMI 15 µg (Original/(Omicron BA.1) 15/15 µg) 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 63/142 
 
 
 
 
6) bivalent BNT162b2 30 µg + BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg. (Original/(Omicron BA.1) 30/30 µg) 
The fourth dose was given median 6.3 months (4.7-12.9) from the third dose. Blood samples for 
immunogenicity evaluations were collected on the vaccination day (baseline) and 1 month after fourth 
dose. 
For substudy D, results have been reported for two study interventions with monovalent vaccines: 
original 30 µg and Omicron BA.1 30 µg 
The immunogenicity results for expanded cohort analyses were based on validated assays for 50% 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers on a newly developed 384-well assay platform (reference strain [USA-
WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020] and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.1) reported as GMTs, 
GMRs, percentages/difference in percentages with seroresponse, GMFRs. Of note, the 384-well SARS-
CoV-2 neutralization assays have been recently validated and, unlike the previously used validated 96-
well mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay platform, do not use reporter viruses with 
fluorescent markers. The neutralizing titers in the 384-well platform and 96-well platform are not 
comparable; the titers from the 384-well assay platform are approximately 2.5-fold higher than those 
from the 96-well assay platform. During the RR, questions about the novel serology method was asked 
and the MAH has answered satisfactorily.   
Neutralization of Omicron variant BA4/BA5 was not studied using this validated assay but in a smaller 
study population including 100 individuals in both Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg and Original 30µg 
using unvalidated method FFRNT. 
The majority (80%) of the study population did not have signs of previous SARS-COV-2 infection. The 
majority of participants had high levels of antibodies against the reference strain (GMT ca 1400) at 
baseline and also low, but detectable levels of anti-Omicron antibodies at baseline (GMT ca 70). 
In Substudy E superior immune responses (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the Geometric Mean 
Ratio (GMR) is >1) to the Omicron BA.1 strain was demonstrated for all 4 novel Omicron strain 
containing vaccine formulations in comparison to the approved Comirnaty 30 µg 1 month after fourth 
dose. The GMR for Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg vs. the approved Original 30 µg was 1.56 (95% CI 
1.17, 2.08). Compared to the pre-boost titre, the antibody titre against Omicron BA.1 strain increased 
9.1 (7.3,11.2) fold after bivalent Original/(Omicron BA.1) 15/15 µg vaccine and 5.8 (4.6, 7.2) fold 
after Original 30 µg vaccine.  
The seroresponse rate against the Omicron BA.1 strain, for Original/Omicron BA.1 30µg was 71.6 % 
versus 57 % for Original 30µg, demonstrating statistically significant superiority (difference 14.6 % 
(4.0, 24.9), pre-defined criteria >-5%). 
Noninferiority based on the GMR for the reference Wuhan strain response was met by both bivalent 
vaccine groups as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 (1.5-fold 
criterion). The GMR for Original/Omicron BA.1 30 µg vs. the approved Original 30 µg was 0.99 (0.82, 
1.2). Compared to pre-boost titres, the antibody titer against reference Strain increased 4.3 fold after 
both vaccines. 
The seroresponse rate for Original/Omicron BA.1 30 µg against the reference strain was 50 %, versus 
49.2% for Original 30µg.  
All study arms had about 230 individuals and a short follow up, which is too low to evaluate VE against 
COVID-19. Breakthrough infections, presumably due to BA.1 or BA.2, were seen in all study arms. 
There is no statistical basis to infer different efficacy between variant vaccines. 
Additional descriptive analyses from Substudy E were performed to further characterize BA.4/BA.5 
neutralization responses following a booster (fourth) dose. A total of 100 participants were randomly 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 64/142 
 
 
 
 
selected from each vaccine group in the expanded cohort. Demographic characteristics for participants 
in this subset were similar between the two vaccine groups. The observed Omicron BA.4/BA.5 
neutralizing GMTs at 1 month post-Dose were numerically slightly higher for the bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.1 30 µg group compared to Original 30 µg group (167.4 vs 155.1). Overall, 
GMFRs (4.5 vs 3.3) and seroresponse (56% vs 42%) followed this trend. The data on immunogenicity 
against BA.5. were obtained with non-validated FFRNT assay. Moreover, it is not known if the 
numerically small increase in neutralising titres compared to that of the original product will be 
associated with improved relative efficacy. 
Also, immunological response to Omicron BA.2.75 strain was investigated in 30 randomly selected 
individuals from both Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg and Original arms from Substudy E. Overall, the 
observed Omicron BA.2.75 neutralizing GMTs at 1 month post-Dose in participants without evidence of 
infection were numerically slightly higher for the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg group 
compared to Original group (108.0 vs 88.8). 
In substudy D approximately 640 participants ≥18 to ≤55 years of age received a fourth dose of either 
approved Original 30 µg or monovalent Omicron BA.1 30 µg about 4 month after the third dose. 
Superior immunogenicity to Omicron BA.1 and non-inferior response to reference strain were 
demonstrated for Omicron BA.1 30 µg compared to the original 30 µg vaccine.  
Numerically, the highest GMR against Omicron BA.1 was achieved for the monovalent Omicron BA.1 60 
µg vaccine candidate and the lowest GMR for the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg variant. 
This is as expected, since the magnitude of the immune response depends on the dose. Interestingly, 
Comirnaty 60 µg elicited numerically the same level of anti- Omicron antibodies as bivalent 15/15 µg, 
which indicates an ability of Comirnaty to elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies.  
If the immune memory after primary series is established, the boosting dose can be lower than was 
used in primary series to trigger anamnestic response. Currently, the MAH seeks approval for bivalent 
15/15 µg formulation as a booster dose and not as primary series, which has not been studied. 
Therefore, choosing the smallest effective dose is endorsed; moreover, an extrapolation of safety to 
younger adults would not be possible if the total dose is higher than 30 µg.  
It is unknown to what extent the increase in neutralising titres against BA.1 would translate into 
increased protection against severe disease; against clinical disease; or against transmission, 
compared to the presently approved vaccine. 
Immune responses are generally stronger in younger people compared to older. Therefore, one can 
extrapolate that the booster effect of Original/Omicron BA.1 30 µg against the Omicron BA.1 strain will 
be seen also in younger people, although data are only available from the abovementioned substudy 
D. In this study a monovalent Omicron BA.1 vaccine at 30 µg elicited stronger responses against 
Omicron BA.1, compared to the Original 30 µg. Whether the relative numerical increment in efficacy of 
Original/Omicron BA.1 compared to Original will be seen also for adults younger than 55, however, is 
unknown. These considerations are relevant also for adolescents 12-18 years of age. 
No information about antibody kinetics over time after the fourth dose has been submitted.  
The MAH seeks approval of a bivalent vaccine Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg as a booster dose, i.e. 
third or fourth dose after a two-dose primary series, although the current application is based on data 
for a fourth dose. However, it is not anticipated that the use of the bivalent adapted vaccine instead of 
the monovalent original vaccine for a third dose would be in any way inferior. It can also be anticipated 
that the bivalent adapted vaccine could be used for boosting regardless of the number of previous 
doses, once the primary vaccination course has been given. 
In conclusion, the CHMP is of the view that the submitted data support the use of bivalent

original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg as booster dose, as the immune responses against BA.1 were superior 
for the bivalent adapted vaccine compared to the original vaccine and the immune responses to the 
original reference strain were non-inferior.  
5.  Clinical Safety aspects 
5.1 Methods  
C4591031 Substudy E 
Study design 
C4591031 substudy E is a randomized, observer-blinded substudy to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
and immunogenicity of monovalent BNT162b2 “Original” (30 and 60 μg), monovalent Omicron BA.1 
“BA.1” (30 and 60 μg), and bivalent combination of Original and BA.1 (15/15µg and 30/30µg), given 
as a single fourth dose. Subjects were enrolled at investigator sites in the US only. Participants >55 
years of age were randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:1 to receive one of the study vaccines as a 
fourth dose.  
Initially, for participants >55 years of age, sentinel cohorts (sponsor open label) of 20 participants per 
group were enrolled, followed by an expanded cohort. E-diary data from Day 1 and Day 2 for the first 
30 participants enrolled in the sentinel cohort (5 per group) were evaluated prior to enrolment of the 
remaining 90 sentinel-cohort participants. This report presents interim data only for participants >55 
years of age. 
If, at any time, a participant develops acute respiratory illness, for the purposes of the study, he or she 
will be considered to potentially have COVID-19 illness. In this circumstance, the participant should 
contact the site, an in-person or telehealth visit should occur, and assessments should be conducted as 
specified in the SoA. The assessments will include collection of a nasal (midturbinate) swab, which will 
be tested at a central laboratory using an RT-PCR test (Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2; authorized 
by the FDA under EUA and Pfizer-validated), or other equivalent nucleic acid amplification–based test 
(i.e., NAAT) to detect SARS-CoV-2. 
Planned measurements and timing of assessment 
Reactogenicity and antipyretic/pain medication use was recorded for 7 days after each dose 
administration using an e-diary. 
AEs were collected for events occurring within 1 month after each vaccination, and SAEs were collected 
for events occurring within 6 months after each vaccination. Acute reactions within the first 30 minutes 
after administration of the study intervention were recorded as immediate AEs. 
AEs of myocarditis and pericarditis were collected for all participants as AESIs. Potential COVID-19 
illnesses and their sequelae that were consistent with the clinical endpoint definition were not recorded 
as AEs or considered AESIs and were not typically reported according to the standard process for 
expedited reporting of SAEs. 
Additionally, the MAH utilized a list of TMEs of specific clinical interest that are highlighted during 
clinical safety data review and signal detection. TMEs are a dynamic list of MedDRA AE terms that are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis throughout the clinical study; the TMEs are based on review of known 
pharmacology, toxicology findings, possible class effects, published literature, and potential signals 
arising from safety data assessments. The TME list includes events of interest due to their association 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022

with COVID-19 and terms of interest for vaccines in general; it takes into consideration the CDC list of 
AESIs for COVID-19. 
C4591031 Substudy D  
C4591031 Substudy D has been designed to assess an Omicron-specific vaccine, BNT162b2 OMICRON 
(B.1.1.529), which is a BNT162b2 RNA-LNP vaccine utilizing modified RNA and encoding the P2 S 
containing Omicron variant-specific mutations (B.1.1.529 sub-variant BA.1). Interim data is presented 
here for participants in Cohort 2, who were enrolled from Study C4591001 and C4591031 Substudy A 
and had received 3 doses of Original 30µg, who were randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive a fourth 
dose of either BA.1 30µg or Original 30µg in C4591031 Substudy D. Randomization was stratified by 
age (18-30, 31-55 years of age). Cohort 2 was observer blinded.  
Reactogenicity antipyretic/pain medication use, and collection of AEs and SAEs were evaluated similar 
as in substudy E.

5.2.2 Demographics 
Expanded Safety Cohort- Safety 
Overall, most participants in the expanded cohort safety population were White (86.6%). The median 
age at the time of study vaccination was 67.0 years, and 49.5% of participants were male. 
Assessment report

Obese participants made up 35.6% of the expanded cohort. In total, 232 (12.6%) participants had 
baseline positive status for evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. The median time from the first 
booster dose of Original 30µg (received prior to the study C4591031 Substudy E) was 6.3 months. 
Expanded cohort participants >55 years of age in the safety population had a diverse medical history 
profile consistent with the age group of this population, and medical history SOCs were generally 
balanced across the vaccine groups. Conditions in the SOCs of surgical and medical procedures (53.4% 
to 60.3%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (48.2% to 56.7%), vascular disorders (44.3% to 
51.3%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (36.7% to 42.2%), and immune system 
disorders (32.5% to 35.8%, including 16.0% to 20.5% seasonal allergy) were most frequently 
reported.

Local reactions   
Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction within 7 days after study 
vaccination, with swelling and redness at the injection site reported much less frequently. Frequency of 
injection site pain was slightly higher for participants in the following groups Original 60µg, BA.1 60µg, 
and Original/BA.1 30/30µg. 
Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Severe local reactions were reported 
infrequently in all vaccine groups; severe events after study vaccination included injection site pain 
(0.3%), swelling (0.2%) and redness (0.3%). No Grade 4 local reactions were reported in any vaccine 
groups evaluated. 
The median onset for all local reactions across vaccine groups evaluated was 2 days, and all events 
resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset.

Systemic reactions 
Fatigue was the most frequently reported systemic event, followed by headache, and less frequently 
chills, muscle and joint pain (Figure 6). In general, systemic events were reported at slightly higher 
frequencies for participants in the 60-µg dose groups.  
Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Severe events were relatively more frequent 
in the BA.1 60µg group.  
The median onset for all systemic events across vaccine groups evaluated was 2 to 3 days, and all 
events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset.

Adverse events – expanded cohort 
Adverse Events from Study Vaccination to Data Cutoff Date 
An overview of AEs from study vaccination to data cutoff date (16 May 2022), which represents a 
median follow-up of at least 1.7 months after study vaccination, is presented in Table 20. 
From study vaccination to the data cutoff date, the proportions of participants with any AEs were 
generally similar. In addition to events already reported up to 1-month post- Dose (Table 19, see 
below), a limited number of additional events were reported up to the data cutoff date. As of the data 
cutoff date, any related or any severe AEs were reported across the vaccine groups by ≤5.1% or 
≤0.9% of participants, respectively. Two additional severe AEs, also reported as SAEs (pneumonia, 
ischaemic stroke) were reported in the Original 30µg group (see, adverse Events from study 
vaccination to data cutoff date). No withdrawals due to AEs were reported in any of the groups beyond 
1-month post-Dose. No study participants died.

(8.5% and 10.4% respectively). Any related (per investigator assessment), SAEs, or severe AEs were 
reported by ≤5.1%, ≤1.0%, and ≤0.9% of participants, respectively. No withdrawals due to AEs or 
deaths were reported.

Subgroup Analyses 
No clinically meaningful patterns within or between groups were noted regarding AE profiles, overall 
and categorically (i.e., related, or severe events) across all vaccine groups when evaluated by 
subgroups of sex, race, ethnicity and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. 
Subgroups of race (Black or African American, Asian), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino), and baseline SARS-
CoV-2 status (positive) included a limited number of participants, and their results should be 
interpreted with caution. While there were numerical differences between subgroups, there were no 
meaningful differences in the overall patterns of AEs by category across these subgroups. Subgroup 
data are summarized below.

Analysis of Adverse Events – expanded cohort 
Adverse Events from Study Vaccination to 1 Month Post-Dose 
Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term 1 Month Post-Dose 
AEs reported from study vaccination to 1-month post-Dose for participants across vaccine groups are 
presented in Table 43. Overall, frequencies of any AEs reported after study vaccination up to 1-month 
post-Dose were generally similar between groups (range: 3.6% to 10.4%), with AEs generally 
reported at similar frequencies in the vaccine groups, except for participants in the BA.1 30µg and 
Original/BA.1 30/30µg groups who reported AEs more frequently (8.5% and 10.4%). 
Many AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events that were reported as AEs (e.g., injection site 
pain, diarrhoea, and pyrexia), which showed no clinically meaningful imbalance between groups. In the 
general disorders and administration site conditions SOC, AEs were reported at numerically higher 
incidence in most of the vaccine groups than the Original 30µg group (range: 0.3% to 2.8%), with the 
highest increases reported in participants in the Original 60µg and bivalent Original/BA.1 /30/30µg 
groups, largely attributable to injection site reactions and fatigue. 
There were no reported events of myocarditis or pericarditis (protocol defined AESIs). Infections and 
illnesses typical of this age group were also reported with no clinically meaningful imbalance between 
groups. This AE profile is generally consistent with the known safety profile of Original 30µg. 
Analysis of AEs from study vaccination to 1-month post-Dose did not suggest any safety concerns. 
Select AEs that were reported from study vaccination to 1-month post-Dose that merit additional detail 
to provide a fuller clinical picture according to the MAH are summarized below.

considered related to study intervention by the investigator. 
Atrial fibrillation: Three participants reported SAEs of atrial fibrillation. These are discussed in detail in 
the section SAEs in the report below.

Subgroup Analyses 1 month post Dose 
Subgroups of participants >55 years of age in the safety population had generally similar AE profiles 
from study vaccination to 1-month post-Dose, across various vaccine groups when evaluated by 
subgroups of sex, race, ethnicity and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. Subgroups of race (Black or African 
American, Asian), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino) and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (positive) included a 
limited number of participants, and their results should be interpreted with caution. 
In general, the AE profiles within each subgroup were similar to the overall AE profile for the safety 
population as whole, reflecting events consistent with reactogenicity and other illnesses that are 
commonly reported in the general population >55 years of age. While there were numerical differences 
between subgroups, there were no meaningful differences in the overall patterns of AEs by category 
across these subgroups. 
Related Adverse Events 1-month post-Dose 
From study vaccination to 1-month post-Dose, AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study 
intervention were reported with generally similar frequencies between groups. Incidence of related AEs 
were numerically higher in the Original 60µg (4.3%), BA.1 30µg (3.3%), and Original/BA.1 30/30µg 
(5.1%) groups (Table 44). 
Most related AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events and in the SOC of general disorders and 
administration site conditions (range: 0.3% to 2.3%). Related AEs of clinical interest (e.g., 
lymphadenopathy, rashes, arthritis) are included in the AESI analysis further below.

No participants in the Original 30- or 60-μg groups or in the BA.1 60-μg group reported severe AEs 
from study vaccination through 1-month post-Dose. 
From study vaccination through 1-month post-Dose, 1 (0.3%) participant in the Original/BA.1

This case concerned an ≥75-year-old male, who experienced gastroesophageal reflux 27 days after 
receiving Dose one study vaccine (Original/BA.1 15/15µg) with the duration of 4 days. This was by the 
investigator assessed as not related to study vaccine and as not an SAE or immediate AE.  
From study vaccination through 1-month post-Dose, 1 (0.3%) participant in the BA.1 30-μg group 
reported a severe AE of dehydration. This event was also reported as a SAE and considered related to 
study intervention by the investigator and is summarized below: 
Participant (≥75-year-old female) 
This medically confirmed case concerned a ≥75-year-old female who experienced dehydration on 2 
days after receiving Dose 1 (BA.1 30 µg). On the morning of Day 2, the participant experienced 
fatigue, generalized malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, severe headache, and diarrhoea. On Day 3, the 
symptoms persisted, and the participant reported feeling "maybe a little shortness of breath," but 
denied experiencing chest pain, dizziness/syncope, or referred pain. The participant reported feeling 
her heart suddenly "pounding" while cleaning. The participant was diagnosed with dehydration by her 
primary care provider, and she presented to the emergency room (ER) for rehydration. At the ER, the

events were ruled out. The participant was diagnosed with pneumonia (assessed by the investigator as 
nonserious event, not related to study vaccine) and was treated with IV azithromycin 500 mg once on 
(Day 3) and the dose was given orally once daily on Days 4 to 7. On Day 4, the dehydration resolved, 
and the participant was discharged from the hospital. On Day 7, the pneumonia resolved. On Day 12 
during a follow-up visit, the participant was in a normal state of health and denied any reoccurrence of 
symptoms or any acute respiratory symptoms. On the same day (Day 12), the diarrhoea was 
considered resolved. In the opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that the 
dehydration was related to the study intervention but was not related to concomitant medications or 
clinical trial procedures. MAH concurred with the investigator’s causality assessment. 
Three (0.9%) participants in the Original/BA.1 30/30µg group reported severe AEs of injection site 
swelling, headache, and muscle weakness (1 participant each). 
Adverse Events from Study Vaccination to Data Cutoff Date 
Few additional AEs were reported from study vaccination from post-Dose to the data cutoff date (16 
May 2022) for participants in the Original 30µg (6.6% vs 5.9%) Original 60µg (7.6% vs 6.6%), and 
BA.1 60µg (3.9% vs 3.6%) groups (Table 20). Overall, frequencies of any AEs reported after study 
vaccination up the data cutoff date were generally similar between vaccine groups. Many of the AEs 
were consistent with reactogenicity events (e.g., pyrexia, and fatigue). Overall, all but one (non-SAE 
case with injection site pain) of the additional AEs and SAEs reported after 1-month post-Dose up to 
the data cutoff date consisted of unrelated events and 2 of them were reported as SAEs: ischaemic 
stroke and pneumonia described in short below: 
Participant (55 – 64-year-old male) 
A 55 - 64-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and memory loss, 
received Dose 1 Original 30µg. Concomitant medications included insulin for diabetes mellitus, 
alendronate for osteoporosis, famotidine, metformin for diabetes mellitus, and memantine for amnesia. 
The participant was diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. 33 days after receiving Dose 1. At Day 33 
the participant woke up with a stroke alert for global aphasia and mild dysarthria and was taken to the 
hospital. A brain computed tomography (CT) showed no haemorrhage and a CT angiogram without 
contrast showed no large vessel occlusion; however, mild to moderate left internal carotid 
atherosclerosis was noted, therefore endovascular therapy was ruled out. A repeat scan after 24 hours 
was stable, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 1. An echocardiogram 
revealed good ejection fraction without a shunt. On the same day (Day 33), the participant had 
hypertension (blood pressure readings were not reported). The diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke was 
confirmed. During hospitalization, the participant received ondansetron, acetylsalicylic acid, 
candesartan, rosuvastatin, and bumetanide (all for 33 days after receiving Dose 1). On Day 35, the 
ischemic stroke and hypertension were considered resolved, and the participant was discharged from 
the hospital. In the opinion of the investigator, there was no reasonable possibility that the ischemic 
stroke was related to the study intervention, concomitant medications, or clinical trial procedures. The 
MAH concurred with the investigator’s causality assessment, and considered that the participant’s 
underlying diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, were considered as high-risk 
factors for the ischemic stroke.

Participant (55 - 64-year-old male) 
A 55 – 64-year-old male was diagnosed and reported with an unrelated severe (Grade 3) pneumonia 
46 days after receiving Dose 1 (Original 30µg), reported as continuing at the data cutoff date. It is 
unknown if the event has resolved, and no further clinical information is available.

Serious Adverse Events 
Summary and Analysis of SAEs from Study Vaccination to Data Cutoff Date 
Few SAEs were reported among participants across the vaccine groups evaluated from study 
vaccination to 1-month post-Dose (n=6) and to the data cutoff date additional 2 cases (16 May 2022) 
(Table 23). One SAE of dehydration in the BA.1 30µg group was considered to be related to study 
intervention by the investigator. SAEs are summarized below.  
Original 30µg group: 
Participant (55 – 64 -year-old male) 
Reported with an unrelated severe (Grade 3) SAE of pneumonia with onset 46 days post-Dose that 
was reported as continuing at the data cutoff date. 
Participant (55- 64 -year-old male) 
Reported with an unrelated severe (Grade 3) SAE of ischaemic stroke concurrent with an unrelated AE 
of hypertension with onset 33 days post-Dose that was reported as resolved within 3 days. 
BA.1 30µg group: 
Participant (≥75-year-old female) 
Reported with a related severe (Grade 3) SAE of dehydration concurrent with nonserious AE of skin 
laceration (unrelated) and diarrhoea (related) with onset on Day 2 post-vaccination and resolved 
within 3 days (except for skin laceration which was reported as continuing at data cutoff date, and 
diarrhoea which resolved within 11 days). This participant also reported a nonserious AE of pneumonia 
(unrelated) with onset on Day 3 post-vaccination and reported as resolved within 5 days. 
Participant (≥75-year-old male) 
Reported with an unrelated mild SAE (Grade 1) of prostate cancer on Day 11 post-Dose that was 
reported as continuing at the data cutoff date. 
Participant (≥75-year-old male) 
Reported an unrelated SAE of nephrolithiasis (left renal calculi, Grade 2) on Day 26 post-Dose that was 
reported as continuing at the data cutoff date.

Original/BA.1 15/15µg group: 
Participant (≥75-year-old male) 
Reported with an unrelated severe (Grade 3) SAE of gastrooesophageal reflux on Day 27 post-
vaccination that was reported as resolved within 4 days. 
Original/BA.1 30/30µg group: 
Participant (≥75-year-old male) 
Reported with an unrelated SAE (Grade 4) of atrial fibrillation on Day 1 of study vaccination that 
resolved within 4 days and considered not related to study intervention by the investigator. This 
participant had a medical history of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, coronary 
artery disease including 5-vessel bypass, hypertension, coronary artery bypass graft and hypertension. 
Participant (≥75-year-old female) 
Reported with an unrelated SAE (Grade 1) of atrial fibrillation on Day 28 of study vaccination that 
resolved within 1 day and considered not related to study intervention by the investigator. This 
participant had a medical history of atrial fibrillation.

Discontinuations from Study Intervention or Study Due to Adverse Events 
No participants in the study discontinued due to AEs from study vaccination to the data cutoff date of 
16 May 2022. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
Some AEs are of specific interest due to their autoimmune or neuroinflammatory nature, theoretical 
association with vaccines, or known occurrence in patients with COVID-19, which includes AEs of 
special interest that have been requested by FDA to be analysed. 
As of the data cutoff date (16 May 2022) there were no cases reported of myocarditis/pericarditis, 
Bell’s palsy (or facial paralysis/paresis), appendicitis, or vaccine related anaphylaxis. AEs of clinical 
interest that were identified in the safety database as of the data cutoff date included 
lymphadenopathy, arthritis and rash, which are summarized below. 
Lymphadenopathy 
Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction to the reference vaccine and is noted as such in 
the product labelling. From study vaccination to data cutoff date, the incidence of lymphadenopathy 
was 0.4% (range 0 to 1.0%) across vaccine groups evaluated (Table 21). 
All 8 events were considered by the investigator as related to study intervention. All cases were mild to 
moderate in severity, occurred generally within 1 to 4 days post-Dose, were located in the axillae and 
most resolved within 2 to 8 days. Additionally, 1 (0.3%) participant in the Original/BA.1 30/30µg 
group reported axillary pain (Grade 1, assessed as related) (Table 21). This event occurred on Day 2 
post-Dose and was resolved within 3 days. 
Rash 
Rash is considered an adverse reaction to the reference vaccine and is noted as such in the product 
labelling. From study vaccination to data cutoff date, 4 participants reported a rash after study 
vaccination (Table 24). All events of rash were mild and considered by the investigator as related to 
study intervention, most events occurred on Day 2 or 3 post vaccination and resolved within 2 to 9 
days after onset. 
One participant in the Original/BA.1 30/30µg group reported a mild event of urticaria on Day 4 post 
vaccination that was reported as resolved within 10 days and considered to be related to study 
intervention by the investigator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 111/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One participant in the BA.1 30µg reported a mild related event of injection site pruritus on Day 4 post 
vaccination that was reported as resolved within 8 days. 
Chest Pain 
Participant (55-64-year-old) 
One (0.3%) participant in the Original 30µg group reported a nonserious AE of chest discomfort (Table 
24). This participant reported a nonserious event of chest discomfort of moderate severity on Day 2 
post study vaccination that resolved within 28 days with no other symptoms. The investigator 
considered the event as related to study intervention. Troponin levels reported at the cardiac illness 
visit were <3 ng/L (reference range: 0-47 ng/L) and ECG was reported as normal. The participant had 
no other reported AEs and had a medical history of type 2 diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, hypertension 
and hyperlipidemia. 
Arthritis 
Participant (65 - 74-year-old male) 
Arthritis (joint inflammation, mild in severity) was reported in a male in the Original 30µg group with 
onset at day 10 post-Dose. This participant had a medical history of osteoarthritis () and spinal 
osteoarthritis, knee arthroplasty, and joint range of motion decreased, received Dose 1 (Original 30µg) 
and experienced arthritis, 9 days after receiving Dose 1. The participant engaged in intense physical 
activity a week prior to the onset of the arthritis. The arthritis was ongoing at the time of the last 
available report. 
Participant (65-74-year-old female) 
Additionally, ankylosing spondylitis (worsening of ankylosing spondylitis, mild in severity) was reported 
in a female participant in the Original/BA.1 15/15µg group with onset of 10 days post-Dose and 
reported as continuing at the time of data cutoff date. Both events were considered not related to 
study intervention by the study physician. 
Angioedema:  
Participant (65-74-year-old female) 
A female with a medical history of hypercholesterolemia, received Dose 1 developed angioedema, 17 
days after receiving Dose 1 (BA.1 30µg). On Day 25 after dose, the angioedema of the face of 
unknown aetiology resolved. On Day 28 after dose, the participant developed swelling, which was 
ongoing at the time of the last available report. In the opinion of the study physician, there was no 
reasonable possibility that the angioedema was related to the study intervention. 
No other AEs were reported by either participant.

Other Safety Evaluations 
Severe COVID-19 Illness 
No severe cases of COVID-19 following study vaccination were reported as of the data cutoff date (16 
May 2022). 
Pregnancy 
Pregnancies were reported as exposure during pregnancies (EDPs) if occurring in a participant or 
participant’s partner within 28 days after last dose of study intervention. There were no EDPs reported 
during the protocol-specified window as of the data cutoff date. 
Surveillance of COVID-19 Cases – Expanded Cohort 
COVID-19 Cases up to Data Cutoff Date 
In the expanded cohort, cases in a total of 30 participants across all vaccine groups were accrued up to 
the data cutoff date of 16 May 2022. 
•  Original 30µg and 60µg groups: 7 and 6 cases, respectively 
•  BA.1 30µg and 60µg groups: 7 and 3 cases, respectively 
•  Original/BA.1 15/15µg and 30/30µg groups: 1 and 6 cases, respectively. 
Most cases (n=29) met both protocol-defined and CDC defined criteria for COVID-19 disease. One case 
in the Original/BA.1 30/30µg group met only the CDC-defined criteria. The reported signs and 
symptoms were generally similar for participants in the different studied vaccine groups, and the most 
commonly reported were new or increased cough (n=19) and sore throat (n=19). Few participants 
reported >3 concurrent signs and symptoms (n=8). 
No cases meeting severe criteria per the FDA or CDC definition were observed in any of the vaccine 
groups.

5.3.2 Reactogenicity  
Local reactions 
The reported local reactions are illustrated in figure 4 below. Most events were mild or moderate in 
severity and no grade 4 local reactions were reported. For both groups, the median onset for all local 
reactions was 1 to 2 days, and all events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset.  
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022

Systemic reactions 
The reported systemic reactions are illustrated in figure 5 below. In both groups, there was 1 
participant (0.3%) with fever >38.9 °C to 40.0 °C; there were no participants in either group with 
fever >40.0 °C. For both groups, the median onset for most systemic events was 1 to 2 days, and all 
events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset. 
Across the BA.1 30µg OMI and Original 30µg vaccine groups, the frequencies of the most commonly 
reported systemic events of fatigue and headache were ≤63.0% and ≤39.0%, respectively, for male 
Assessment report

and ≤70.5% and ≤62.3%, respectively, female participants, respectively. There were no differences in 
severity between sex in terms of reported local reactions. 
5.3.3 Adverse Events  
Participants reporting AEs from first study (Dose 4) vaccination to 1 month after Dose 4 are described 
in Table 19 below.  
Table 51.  Number (%) of Participants Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event From First Study 
Vaccination Through 1 Month After First Study Vaccination –Cohort 2 – Safety Population 
The frequency of any AE after Dose 4 dose administration was ≤6.7% in male participants and ≤4.6% 
in female participants across vaccine groups. Related AEs were reported by ≤3.7% of male participants 
and ≤2.6% of female participants (with numerical differences between vaccine groups driven by 
reactogenicity events in these subgroups). 
Most AEs reported during this period reflect reactogenicity events (ie, fatigue, chills, myalgia, pyrexia, 
headache, injection site pain), which accounted for the majority of severe AEs. The SOCs in which the 
reactogenicity terms are included had the following overall AE frequencies in the BA.1 30µg group 
versus Original 30µg group: 
• 
general disorders and administration site conditions: 9 (2.9%) vs 0

Immediate AEs 
No immediate AEs (occurring within 30 minutes post-vaccination) were reported after first study (Dose 
4) vaccination for either vaccine groups. 
Severe and Life-Threatening AEs 
From first study (Dose 4) vaccination to 1 month after Dose 4, the frequency of severe AEs was low for 
the BA.1 30µg (4 participants [1.3%]) and the Original 30µg groups (2 participants [0.6%]). In the 
BA.1 30µg group, all were severe reactogenicity events: fatigue, chills, arthralgia, and headache. 
Severe AEs reported in the Original 30µg group were fluid retention (SAE, assessed as not related) and 
diarrhoea. No life-threatening (ie, Grade 4) AEs were reported after Dose 4 in either vaccine group.  
Serious AEs 
From first study (Dose 4) vaccination to 1 month after Dose 4, 2 participants, 1 in each group, 
reported 1 SAE each, both of which were assessed as not related: 
• 
• 
In the BA.1 30µg group, there was 1 event of migraine (unrelated) reported 22 days 
after Dose 4 that was ongoing as of the data cut-off date. 
In the Original 30µg group, there was 1 event of fluid retention (unrelated) reported 25 
days after Dose 4 and resolved within 6 days. 
Discontinuation from Study due to AEs 
No participants in the study were withdrawn due to AEs from first study (Dose 4) vaccination to the 
data cut-off date of 11 March 2022. 
Other Significant AEs 
No cases of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, myocarditis, pericarditis, appendicitis, Bell’s Palsy, or rash 
were reported in either group in C4591031 Substudy D from first study (Dose 4) vaccination to up to 
1-month post-Dose 4 or to the data cut-off date. Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction 
to Original 30µg, and events are discussed below. Additional AEs of clinical interest, including those on 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022

the CDC AESI list, were evaluated based on sponsor agent safety data review. These AEs were 
identified from the C4591031 study database as of the data cut-off date. From the analysis of reported 
AEs, there were no additional safety concerns. Notable pertinent negatives (ie, no cases reported in 
this population as of the data cut-off for this report) with regard to the CDC list of AESIs included (but 
were not limited to): arthritis, thrombocytopenic events, thromboembolic or intravascular coagulation 
events, autoimmune or demyelination events, myocarditis, pericarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, optic 
neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, vasculitis, Kawasaki disease, MIS, or acute respiratory distress 
syndrome. AESIs of chest pain and herpes zoster are discussed below. 
Lymphadenopathy 
From Dose 4 to the data cutoff date, lymphadenopathy was reported in 1 participant (0.3%) and 3 
participants (0.9%) in the BA.1 30µg and Original 30µg groups, respectively. All 4 events were 
considered by the investigator as related to study intervention and occurred in the older (31 to 55 
years) age group. Cases of lymphadenopathy were mild to moderate, occurred within 2 to 3 days after 
Dose 4 dose administration, were located in the axillae (predominantly) or cervical nodes, and 
recovered/resolved within 3 to 8 days (with sequalae for the participant in the BNT162b2 group). 
Additionally, 1 participant (0.3%) in the BA.1 30µg group reported axillary pain (Grade 1, assessed as 
related). The event occurred 3 days after Dose 4 and was resolved within 6 days. 
Chest Pain 
In the BA.1 30µg group, there were 2 events of chest pain, both Grade 1 and assessed as related. 
• 
In a 25 – 34-year-old female, chest pain was reported 4 days after Dose 4 and was resolved within 
3 hours with no other symptoms. The investigator considered the event as stress related and did 
not think it met criteria for cardiac illness; no further investigations were performed. The physician 
noted a temporal relationship (stress relating to ‘anxiety’ from recent receipt of the vaccine) and 
the event was designated as related to the investigational product. The participant had no other 
reported AEs.  
• 
In a 35 – 44 year- old male, chest pain was reported 2 days after Dose 4 and was resolved within 
10 days. Pain was constant for the first 2 days and decreased to a few minutes a day afterward. 
The participant had no shortness of breath or palpitations. The event was assessed as related to 
investigational product. At a cardiac illness visit 5 days after the event onset, the participant had 
no elevation in troponin, mean heart rate was 78 beats/minute, ECG normal, and 
echocardiography was normal. The participant had no other reported AEs. 
Herpes Zoster 
In 1 participant in the Original 30µg group, an AE of herpes zoster (mild, resolved, assessed as 
unrelated) was reported 1 day after Dose 4. No other AEs were reported for the participant. 
C4591031 Substudy D summary 
Reactogenicity Profile 
Overall, the reactogenicity profile (local reactions, systemic events) within 7 days after BA.1 30µg and 
Original 30µg administered as a fourth dose was similar to that previously observed after a third dose 
of Original 30µg. Analyses by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status suggested no 
meaningful differences across subgroups or between vaccine groups for the overall patterns of local 
reactions or systemic events, although due to limited numbers in some subgroups, the subgroup 
analyses should be interpreted with caution. 
• 
Local reactions were mostly mild to moderate, with the majority of events arising within the 
first 1 to 2 days after dosing and were short-lived. The most common prompted local reaction 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 122/142 
 
 
 
 
was pain at the injection site (≤78.4%) in both groups. Few severe (≤1.0%) and no Grade 4 
local reactions were reported. 
•  Systemic events were mostly mild to moderate, with the majority of events arising within the 
first 1 to 2 days after dosing and were short-lived. The most common prompted systemic 
events were fatigue (≤64.3%) and headache (≤47.6%) in both groups. Few severe (≤3.4%) 
and no Grade 4 systemic events were reported. 
Adverse Event Profile 
The AE profiles after Dose 4 of Original 30µg or BA.1 30µg were similar, reflected mostly reactogenicity 
events, and did not suggest any clinically important short-term safety concerns. Subgroup analyses did 
not suggest any specific safety concerns with regard to age, sex, race, ethnicity, or baseline SARS-
CoV-2 status. From Dose 4 to 1-month post-Dose 4, a similar proportion of participants in the BA.1 
30µg group (5.7%) reported any AE compared with the Original 30µg group (3.7%). This was driven 
primarily by any AEs considered by the investigator as related to study intervention, reported by 3.2% 
of participants in the BA.1 30µg group and 1.5% of participants in the Original 30µg group. Any severe 
or serious AEs were reported across the BA.1 30µg  and Original 30µg groups by ≤1.3% and ≤0.3%, 
respectively. 
The proportion of participants reporting any AE after Dose 4 to the data cut-off date of 11 March 2022, 
which represents up to at least 1-month post-Dose 4 follow-up, was similar in the BA.1 30µg (5.7%) 
and Original 30µg (3.7%) groups. No additional AEs were reported between 1 month after Dose 4 to 
the data cut-off date.  
After Dose 4, there were few AEs of clinical interest reported in both BA.1 30µg and Original 30µg 
groups. Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction to Original 30µg and was observed after 
Dose 4 in both BA.1 30µg (n=1) and Original 30µg (n=3) groups. No cases of anaphylaxis, 
hypersensitivity, myocarditis/pericarditis, appendicitis, Bell’s Palsy, or rash were reported in either 
group over the course of at least 1 month of follow-up after Dose 4 in individuals 18 to 55 years of 
age. 
5.4 Discussion 
Evidence base for the safety of Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15ug 
The MAH has provided 1-month interim data from study C4591031 substudy E in which the already 
authorized monovalent “Original 30µg” was compared with five different vaccines of different 
composition: monovalent “Original” 60µg, monovalent Omicron BA.1 “BA.1” 30µg, monovalent 
Omicron BA.1 “BA.1” 60µg and two bivalent combinations of Original/BA.1 (15/15µg and 30/30µg). 
Only data for subjects aged >55 years of age have been presented by the company. This study 
included 1841 subjects, most of which (89%) had a follow-up time of ≥1 month to <2 months after 
vaccination. 305 subjects received the Original/BA.1 15/15 µg vaccine.  
All doses were administered as a fourth dose, and all subjects had already received 3 doses of Original 
30µg.  
Data from C4591031 substudy D has also been provided. In this dataset 640 subjects aged 18-55 
years were randomized to receive either the monovalent BA.1 30 µg (n=315) or the authorized 
Original 30 µg (n=325) as a fourth dose. All 640 subjects received one dose of either vaccine. 
Thus, reactogenicity and safety data are available for the bivalent Original/BA.1 15/15 µg vaccine in 
subjects aged 55 and higher. In subjects below this age, data are only available for a monovalent BA.1 
vaccine variant at 30ug.  
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 123/142 
 
 
 
 
In both substudy D and E, reactogenicity (systemic and local events) and use of antipyretic/pain 
medication was recorded for 7 days after administration of each dose by using an e-diary. AEs were 
collected for 1 month and SAEs for 6 months after dosing. Acute reactions were recorded as immediate 
if they occurred within 30 min after administration of the vaccine.  
Most of the included subjects in both substudy D and E were white. The studies were executed in the 
US and the distribution between gender was balanced. It is noted that 71-73% of the subjects were 
overweight or obese.  
In substudy E, all participants, except one subject in the Original/BA.1 15/15µg group, received their 
booster dose at least 5 months after their last vaccination (median time 6,3 months, range 5-13 
months.  
In substudy E the median age was 67 years. In substudy D all subjects received their fourth dose at a 
median time of 4 months after their last vaccination (range 3,3-6,8 months) and the median age was 
43 years, and only 13% (n=84) of the entire study population were 18-30 years old. 
Reactogenicity 
Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction in all study groups in substudy E. 
(58% Original/BA.1 15/15µg; 60% Original 30µg; 68% Original/BA.1 30/30µg).  
Most of the local reactions were mild to moderate in severity, no grade 4 reaction were reported.  
The median time to onset for the local reactions was 2 days and all events resolved within a median 
duration of 1-2 days after onset.  
In substudy D, pain at the injection site was the most common local reaction in both BA.1 30µg and 
Original 30µg (78% each).  
Most of the local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and no Grade 4 local reactions were 
reported.  
For both groups, the median onset for all local reactions was 1 to 2 days, and all events resolved 
within a median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset. 
In substudy E, the most frequently reported systemic reactions were fatigue (49% Original/BA.1 15/15 
µg; 45% Original 30 µg; 57% Original/BA.1 30/30µg); headache (34% Original/BA.1 15/15µg; 27% 
Original 30 µg; 37% Original/BA.1 30/30µg); muscle pain (22% Original/BA.1 15/15µg; 20% Original 
30µg; 27% Original/BA.1 30/30µg), chills (13% Original/BA.1 15/15 µg; 16% Original 30µg; 24% 
Original/BA.1 30/30µg), joint pain (11% Original/BA.1 15/15 µg; 9% Original 30µg; 19% 
Original/BA.1 30/30µg) and fever (5% Original/BA.1 15/15µg; 4% Original 30µg; 8% Original/BA.1 
30/30µg).  
Four events of fever >38,9-40oC were reported in the group that received Original/BA.1 15/15µg 
vaccine, whereas none in the Original 30µg reported fever >38,9oC. The only event of fever >40,0oC 
was reported by a subject that received BA.1 60µg; in that group four events of fever >38,9-40oC 
were also reported.  
Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity.  
The median onset for all systemic events across vaccine groups evaluated was 2 to 3 days, and all 
events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset. 
It was noted that the group receiving BA.1 60 µg reported a slightly higher frequency and severity of 
systemic reactions compared to the other study arms. This is indicative of the importance of the mRNA 
dose for the reactogenicity profile, and indicative that the extrapolation of the reactogenicity of a 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 124/142 
 
 
 
 
higher dose from older to younger subjects might not be appropriate. Moreover, there was a general 
tendency for numerically higher rates of systemic reactions when the vaccine included Omicron BA.1. 
In the substudy D, fatigue was the most reported systemic reaction (64% BA.1 30µg; 60% Original 30 
µg), followed by headache (48% BA.1 30µg; 45% Original 30 µg), muscle pain (34% BA.1 30 µg; 28% 
Original 30 µg). Fever events were reported 9% BA.1 30 µg; 6% Original 30µg.  
Most of the events were mild or moderate in severity and no Grade 4 systemic events were reported. 
For both groups, the median onset for most systemic events was 1 to 2 days, and all events resolved 
within a median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset. 
In substudy E, antipyretic or pain medication were used at similar frequency for the subjects that 
received Original/BA.1 15/15 µg (29%) as for the subject that received Original 30 µg (27%).  
In summary, the frequency of local reactions was slightly higher among the younger subjects included 
in substudy D compared with the older adults included in substudy E. This would be anticipated, as 
reactogenicity is generally higher in younger compared to older subjects. Yet higher rates are 
anticipated in adolescents aged 12-18, as is the case for the Original 30µg vaccine. Moreover, similar 
to substudy E, the rate of systemic reactions tended to be numerically higher with the Omicron BA.1 
vaccine construct compared to the original. 
Thus, across the two trials, there is a tendency for numerically slightly higher frequencies of 
reactogenicity-related events with BA.1 containing vaccines. However, these differences are marginal 
and not deemed clinically meaningful, and do not preclude the extrapolation of safety from the >55 to 
younger adults, as described below.  
Overall adverse events 
AEs in substudy E were reported for the time period up to 1 month after dosing and up to cutoff date 
(16MAY2022) which represents a median follow-up of at least 1.7 months after study vaccination.  
The rate for any AEs up to the cutoff date in Substudy E was roughly similar across treatment arms 
(range: 3.9% (BA.1 60µg) - 10.4% (Original/BA.1 30/30 µg)).  
Severe AEs were uncommonly reported across study arms.  
No additional safety concern was observed regarding AEs in Substudy D. The number of any reported 
AE was overall low (5,7%, BA.1 30µg; 3,7%, Original 30µg). 
Though slightly higher rates of adverse events were noted among females, there were no meaningful 
differences in reactogenicity or other adverse events between subgroups based on race, ethnicity or 
evidence of prior SARS-Cov-2 infection. 
There were no cases reported of myocarditis/pericarditis, Bell’s palsy (or facial paralysis/paresis), or 
vaccine-related anaphylaxis, in either study. 
There were no deaths in the studies and no new safety concerns compared to what is known of 
Comirnaty Original, were identified. 
Altogether, no clinically relevant differences in the AE profile were seen between study arms for the 
time period up to 1 month compared to time interval up to cutoff. However, the size of the safety 
database for BA.1 containing variant vaccines is not large enough to characterise the frequency of rare 
adverse events. Therefore, it is not known whether the risk of myocarditis is similar for the original 
vaccine, and the Original/BA.1 15/15µg variant vaccine. This, however, would require very large 
studies to characterise, which is only feasible in a post-authorisation setting.

Conclusion on clinical safety 
While systemic reactogenicity events may be somewhat more common when an Omicron component is 
included in the booster, the reactogenicity profile of a booster dose with bivalent vaccine Original/BA.1 
15/15µg does not appear meaningfully different from that reported earlier for Original 30µg primary 
vaccine series and booster. This would be anticipated, given that the products differ only with respect 
to the spike protein sequence of the Omicron BA.1 component. Whether rare adverse events based on 
molecular mimicry differ, is unknown. 
Safety data for Original/BA.1 15/15µg is at this stage only available in subjects aged >55 years. 
However, based on (a) a similar total dose of mRNA, (b) no relevant differences in reactogenicity 
between Original and Original/BA.1 in those aged above 55, and (c) no relevant differences in 
reactogenicity between Original and BA.1 in those below 55, the inference may be drawn that 
reactogenicity will be acceptable also in adults below 55. Consequently, a substantially different safety 
profile in adolescents or younger adults, compared to the available Original 30µg, is considered 
sufficiently unlikely. 
There are no safety data for the use of Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 as a third dose in total, as a fifth 
dose in total, or after a primary series with another COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, there are no safety 
data for a repeat booster with Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15. However, there are no reasons to believe 
that the safety profile would differ substantially in any of these scenarios as this was not seen for the 
original vaccine. 
Immunogenicity and safety of the Original/BA.1 15/15µg vaccine in subjects aged 18-55 is currently 
being assessed in an ongoing study. Data from this study will be reported as a post authorisation 
commitment. 
No data has been presented on BA.1-variant vaccine in pregnancy. However, the total mRNA dose is 
the same as for Original vaccine, and reactogenicity is similar. Moreover, as noted, the only difference 
between products lies in the spike protein sequence. Therefore, a conclusion of acceptable safety in 
pregnancy and breast-feeding as well as the safety profile in general is drawn by the CHMP for the 
variant vaccine.

SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Module SIII  Clinical trial exposure 
This module of the RMP has been updated with the Evaluation of additional boosting dose(s) providing 
new clinical data in approximately 1840 participants >55 years of age from ongoing C4591031 
Substudy E (BNT162b2-experienced participants), including safety and immunogenicity data up to 1 
month after receipt of a single dose (Dose 4) of BNT162b2 (30 or 60μg), monovalent BNT162b2 OMI 
(30 or 60μg), or bivalent BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 OMI (30 or 60μg). 
In addition, clinical data from approximately 640 participants ≥18 to ≤55 years of age from ongoing 
Study C4591031, phase 3 Substudy D (Cohort 2: BNT162b2-experienced participants), including 
safety and immunogenicity to 1 month after receipt of an additional booster (fourth) dose of an 
Omicron variant specific vaccine, BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg are provided. 
Module SVII  Identified and potential risks 
This module of the RMP has been updated to remove Anaphylaxis as an important identified risk in the 
list of safety concerns (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0087, issued 10 March 2022) because anaphylaxis is a 
known risk of vaccines that is understood by HCPs who administer vaccines and patients and does not 
considerably impact the benefit/risk profile of the vaccine. Product labelling and standards of medical 
care during the vaccination procedure provide adequate risk mitigation. 
Module SVIII  Summary of the safety concerns 
Anaphylaxis has been removed as an important identified risk.

PART III 
PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCL POST AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES) 
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities 
This section has been updated to remove reference to summary safety reports as per the final 
EMA/PRAC assessment (PAM-MEA-002.13 issued 08 June 2022). 
In addition, subsection Potential Medication errors has been updated to add Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) formulation in the vial differentiation description. 
Large scale public health approaches for vaccination may represent changes to standard vaccine 
treatment process with the use of various formulations to different healthcare settings based on age 
(ie. less than 12 years and above 12 years of age). This represents the likelihood of the purple 
(DILUTE BEFORE USE) and grey (DO NOT DILUTE) vials co-existing in the same setting. These 
potential medication errors are mitigated through the information in the label (colour of label boarder, 
product name on the label) and available educational materials for healthcare providers. 
Note that a meeting between the EMA and the MAH has been taken place in June 2022 to clarify the 
colour code system of the vials. The MAH's strategy is based on the use of different cap colours to 
distinguish the different authorised presentations for 3 different age groups (grey flip-off caps >12 
years and ready to use formulation, orange flip-off caps 5 to 11 years, brown flip-off caps intended for 
the 6 months to 4 years). Hence, according to the MAH the introduction of new cap colours for each 
variant-adapted vaccine in addition to the use of colours to support age groups would create further 
complexity in the colour codes used and may potentially increase the risk of confusion with the 
different dose levels / formulations resulting in an increase in medication errors that have a higher 
impact on safety (wrong dose / administration of undiluted concentrate). 
Apart from manufacturing issues and the fact that the availability of cap colours is limited, the MAH 
claims that any change on the cap colour will delay the launch by 7 months, as standard colours (off 
the shelf) are limited in number by the range offered by the manufacturers. Extraordinary colours (not 
off the shelf) would offer a broader range but only under extended lead times. Also the availability of 
caps is limited. Due to the high demand of caps and the impaired global supply chains, the availability 
of caps independent on the colour is limited. The capacity of cap production has the potential to limit 
vaccine production. In case of a non-standard colour, the continuous supply and initial ramp up 
capacity of those caps would increase the risk of supply constraints. 
To reduce the potential of Medication errors, various educational resources (e.g. poster, dosing card, 
medical information call centers, traceability and vaccination reminder card) to inform HCPs on the 
proper preparation and differentiation will be available. 
When considering the risk of medication errors due to the mix-up of different vials, from a safety 
perspective the most relevant medication error would be the administration of a presentation for adults 
to children or the presentation for older children administered to younger children, as such medication 
errors would lead to overdose. The MAH’s strategy to distinguish cap colours for different age groups 
would mitigate this risk of medication error. Medication errors due to mix-up between Comirnaty 
Original (monovalent) and Comirnaty bivalent vaccines – same cap colour for one age group – are not 
mitigated with this strategy. However, considering the safety profiles of the monovalent and bivalent 
vaccine appears to be comparable, a safety concern is considered limited. Furthermore, it is noted that 
introduction of different colour flip-off caps would take about 7 months, by when HCPs would 
presumably be familiar with handling different presentation with same colour flip-off caps.  
It is acknowledged that introduction of new cap colours for each variant-adapted vaccine in addition to 
the use of colours to support age groups would result in at least 3 additional colours for all dose levels 
for an omicron-adapted vaccine. The MAH argues that this would create further complexity in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 129/142 
 
 
 
 
colour codes used and may potentially increase the risk of confusion with the different dose levels / 
formulations resulting in an increase in medication errors that have a higher impact on safety (wrong 
dose / administration of undiluted concentrate). 
However, expert input from clinical practice raised concerns about the same colour flip off for 
‘Comirnaty original’ and the new bivalent vaccine. As it cannot be ruled out that in future a new/further 
variant vaccine is developed and introduced, the MAH is requested to prepare for such scenario (also 
regarding flip off caps to avoid that time needed to arrange for other colour caps would be a blocking 
issue). While respecting the MAH’s current colour coding strategy, an option could be to use light and 
dark colour flip off caps for existing and new vaccines. 
Various educational resources (e.g. poster, dosing card, medical information call centers, traceability 
and vaccination reminder card) are already in place and will be updated with the introduction of this 
modified vaccine. These are considered routine risk minimization measures and considered sufficient at 
this stage.  
The MAH confirmed, further to the launch of the modified vaccines, their commitment to carefully 
monitor medication errors and inform the authorities immediately in case of any unexpected findings 
or trends.

Considering section III.1 Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities of the RMP, it was suggested to rephrase 
the wording educational materials in subsections Potential Medication Errors and Cold-chain Handling 
and Storage to avoid confusion. Note there are several resources (e.g. traceability, medical information 
call centers available for HCP etc.) and reference materials (e.g. poster with instruction for vaccine 
storage, brochures for safe handling of the vaccine, vaccination reminder card etc.) in place. However, 
these are all considered routine PV activities. As requested, in RMP v 6.1, the wording educational 
materials has been rephrased into resources and referenced materials in line with Annex 7 of the RMP. 
Considering the Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities, the modified vaccine Original/Omicron BA.1 
did not seem to be addressed in the ongoing PASSs included in the RMP v 6.0. However, the MAH will 
assess the non-interventional studies C4591012 (US), C4591021 (EU), and C4591036 (US/CA former 
Paediatric Heart Network [PHN]) for the feasibility of studying the bivalent Omicron-modified vaccine. 
The MAH notes that feasibility is dependent on the ability to uniquely identify the bivalent vaccine as 
the booster dose administered. Additionally, the MAH will explore the feasibility of a new stand-alone 
study in the general US population and in sub-cohorts of interest, who have received the bivalent 
Omicron-modified vaccine. Due to measures implemented by the MAH (e.g. differences in naming, 
labelling), the bivalent vaccine will be uniquely identified. In view of the limited clinical data available 
for the bivalent vaccine compared to the initial monovalent vaccine, it is important that further safety 
data on the bivalent vaccine is collected in the post-marketing setting and the modified vaccine needs 
to be addressed in all PASSs. The MAH was requested to include the current bivalent vaccine as well as 
future modified vaccines in all ongoing PASSs; the MAH committed to submit the PASS protocol 
amendments as soon as possible; further details and discussion will be included in an updated RMP 
submitted at the earliest regulatory opportunity. 
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan 
The proposed updated post-authorisation PhV development plan (per RMP v.6.1) is considered 
sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP are acceptable. RMP version 6.1 is considered approved with this variation. 
Further discussions on the post-marketing pharmacovigilance planning adapted to the new 
formulation(s) will continue in the framework of upcoming variation(s). 
7.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, the SmPC and the Package Leaflet (PL) have been updated. 
Please refer to the attached PI which includes all proposed changes to the Product Information. 
Quick Response (QR) code 
The updated content of the QR code has been assessed in EMEA/H/C/005735/N/0132 and in an 
updated Art.61(3) Comirnaty: QR-Code website - proposed updates to reflect new presentations. 
The main proposed changes are clear references to the SmPC/PL instead of repeating information 
separately on the web page. Furthermore, clear tables stating each and respective presentation are 
proposed. These tables should be complemented with complete name for easier identification, which is 
also in line with the ongoing discussion on the colour of the flip off cap, where the prominence of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 133/142 
 
 
 
 
product name should be the focus for distinguishing products, rather than trusting the cap colour only.  
The principles for the web page are endorsed, however, concerning future presentations, publishing of 
these web pages should be timed.  
Labelling exemptions 
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the 
flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines 
(EMA/689080/2020 rev.1, from 16 December 2020) document which aims at facilitating the 
preparedness work of COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing 
packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID-
19 vaccines for EU citizens within the existing legal framework 
Labelling exemptions

8.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk 
balance 
Introduction 
BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, “Original”) 30 µg is administered intramuscularly (IM) as a primary series of 
two doses given 3 weeks apart to individuals ≥12 years of age. Booster doses of Comirnaty 30 µg may 
be administered to individuals ≥12 years of age. The sequence coding for the spike protein in the 
present vaccine (termed “original” below) is based on that of the Wuhan strain. 
The applicant is seeking the approval of a bivalent vaccine including 15µg of the original vaccine 
variant, and 15µg of a variant encoding the omicron BA.1 spike protein sequence. Apart from this, the 
products are considered similar. The sought indication is similar to the that of the Original 30µg 
variant: 
“Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 micrograms per dose dispersion for injection is indicated for 
active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 12 years of age 
and older.” 
However, in section 4.2. of the proposed SmPC, it is clear that the applicant’s intended use is for 
booster only (not for primary series). 
Disease or condition 
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has repeatedly evolved and appeared in several variants causing new waves of 
infection. The variants have so far shown cross-reactivity with the original strain, which was the base 
for the currently approved vaccines. However, there is a concern that presently circulating virus 
variants are less cross-reactive with the original strain.  The variant causing the latest waves of 
disease previous to this application has been the Omicron variant, with several subvariants beginning 
with BA.1 and currently BA.5 is dominating in the EU. 
While the efficacy of available vaccines, emulating the Wuhan strain, against severe disease appears 
largely retained, efficacy against symptomatic disease due to omicron variants is obviously reduced. 
Moreover, the duration of protection with the original may be reduced given that the emerging variant 
is less sensitive than the original target. 
It is generally considered that protection may be optimised by a vaccine with a sequence that is as 
close to the circulating variant as possible. Moreover, it is hypothesised that a booster vaccine based 
on a variant virus strain will result in broader immunity against SARS-CoV-2. To optimize vaccines in 
the present situation, regulatory bodies (ICMRA) and WHO have suggested that a bivalent vaccine 
including both original as well as an omicron variant may be desirable. 
Main clinical studies 
The MAH has conducted clinical studies with variant vaccine mono- and bivalent (Original/BA.1) 
candidates including mRNA transcribing Omicron variant S protein.  
This application concerns a booster dose with a bivalent original/Omicron (BA.1) vaccine, (BNT162b2 
Original 15 µg + BNT162b2 OMI 15 µg = Original/BA.1 15/15 µg), given ≥4 months after the third 
dose to subjects≥12 years of age.  
The application is based primarily on clinical data from Study C4591031 Substudy E, investigating the 
safety and immune responses following a fourth dose of vaccine, in approximately 1840 older adult 
(>55 years of age) participants. Bivalent vaccines Original/BA.1 15/15 µg, Original/BA.1 30/30 µg, 
monovalent BA.1 at 30 µg and 60 µg; and Original 60 µg were compared to approved Original 
Assessment report

Comirnaty 30 µg. In this substudy, all subjects had previously received 3 doses of Original Comirnaty 
30 µg. 
Supportive data are provided from Study C4591031 Substudy D investigating safety and 
immunogenicity of an investigational monovalent Omicron BA.1 vaccine where 640 subjects aged 18-
55 years (majority 30-55 years, 13% were 18-<30 years old) were randomized to receive either the 
monovalent BA.1 30µg (n=315) or the authorized Original 30µg (n=325) as a fourth dose. In this 
substudy also, all subjects had previously received 3 doses of Original Comirnaty 30µg. 
Both substudies had as its primary objective investigation of the immunogenicity of different Omicron 
containing vaccine formulations as a fourth dose compared to a fourth dose of Original 30 µg.  
The primary endpoint of these studies was to show that the novel vaccine formulations, containing the 
Omicron strain can induce superior immune responses to the Omicron BA.1 virus variant, and induce 
non-inferior response to the reference strain compared to Original 30 µg.  
There is currently no immunological correlate of protection established for Covid-19, and therefore the 
relevance of numerical titre differences, in terms of impact on protection against severe disease or any 
clinical disease, cannot be determined.  
The serological comparison is considered acceptable as efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical 
studies and neutralizing antibodies are considered an acceptable surrogate endpoint for efficacy. As 
stated above, it is assumed that efficacy against a new variant will be at least comparable and possibly 
superior, if superior levels of neutralizing antibodies are detected following booster with a variant 
vaccine compared to the original vaccine. The quantification of such incremental effects, however, will 
need to be based on real-world evidence, given that no randomised controlled trial of the variant-
adapted vaccine against the original vaccine is required, according to generally agreed regulatory 
policy (ICMRA). 
Substudy E contained 6 study arms. In each arm approximately 230 individuals received either 1) 
Original 30µg, 2) Original 60µg, 3) BA.1 30µg 4) BA.1 60µg 5) Original/BA.1 15/15 µg, 6) 
Original/BA.1 30/30µg. The fourth dose was given median 6.3 months (4.7-12.9) from the third dose. 
Blood samples for immunogenicity evaluations were collected on the vaccination day (baseline) and 1 
month after fourth dose. The study was not designed to investigate vaccine efficacy; however, subjects 
were to report any symptoms that might be due to COVID, which would prompt PCR testing.  
For substudy D, results have been reported for two study interventions with monovalent vaccines: 
Original 30µg, and BA.1 30µg. 
In both substudy D and E, reactogenicity and use of antipyretic/pain medication was recorded for 7 
days after administration of each dose by using an e-diary. After each dose administration, AEs were 
collected for 1 month and SAEs for 6 months. Acute reactions were recorded as immediate if they 
occurred within 30 min after administration of the vaccine. 
The immunogenicity results were based on validated assays for 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers for 
the original virus strain (USA-WA1/2020) and Omicron B.1.1.529 subvariant BA.1. Neutralization of 
Omicron variant BA4/BA5 was not studied using this validated assay but in a smaller study population 
including 100 individuals in both Original/BA.1 15/15 µg and Original 30µg using unvalidated methods. 
Favourable effects 
In Substudy E superior immune responses (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the Geometric Mean 
Ratio (GMR) is >1) to the Omicron BA.1 strain was demonstrated for all 4 novel Omicron strain 
containing vaccine formulations in comparison to the approved Comirnaty 30 µg 1 months after fourth 
dose. The GMR for Original/BA.1 30 µg vs. the approved Original 30 µg was 1.56 (95% CI 1.45, 2.68).  
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 136/142 
 
 
 
 
Compared to the pre-boost titre, the antibody titre against Omicron BA1. strain increased 9.1- 
(7.3,11.2) fold after bivalent Original/BA.1 15/15 µg vaccine and 5.8- (4.6, 7.2) fold after Original 
30µg vaccine.  
The sero-response rate of Original/BA.1 30µg was 71.6 % versus 57 % for Original 30µg, 
demonstrating statistically significant superiority (difference 14.6 % (4.0, 24.9), pre-defined criteria >-
5%). 
Noninferiority based on the GMR for reference strain response was met by both bivalent vaccine 
groups as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 (1.5-fold criterion). 
The GMR for Original/BA.1 30µg vs. the approved Original/BA.1 was 0.99 (0.82, 1.2). Compared to 
pre-boost titres, the antibody titer against Wuhan Strain increased 4.3-fold after both vaccines. 
The sero-response rate for Original/BA.1 30 µg against the reference strain was 50 %, versus 49.2% 
for Original 30µg.  
Additional descriptive analyses from Substudy E were performed to further characterize BA.4/BA.5 
neutralization responses following a booster (fourth) dose. A total of 100 participants were randomly 
selected from each vaccine group in the expanded cohort. Demographic characteristics for participants 
in this subset were similar between the two vaccine groups. The observed Omicron BA.4/BA.5 
neutralizing GMTs at one-month post-Dose were numerically slightly higher for the bivalent 
Original/BA.1 group compared to Original 30 µg group (167.4 vs 155.1). Overall, GMFRs (4.5 vs 3.3) 
and seroresponse (56% vs 42%) followed this trend.  
Also, immunological response to Omicron BA.2.75 strain was investigated in 30 randomly selected 
individuals from both Original/Omicron BA1 15/15 µg and original arms from Substudy E. Overall, the 
observed Omicron BA.2.75 neutralizing GMTs at 1-month post-Dose in participants without evidence of 
infection were numerically slightly higher for the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg group 
compared to Original group (108.0 vs 88.8). 
Each study arm had about 230 subjects. In the expanded cohort, cases in a total of 30 cases of COVID-
19 across all vaccine groups were accrued up to the data cutoff date of 16 May 2022. 
Original 30 µg and 60 µg groups: 7 and 6 cases, respectively; Omicron BA1. 30 µg and 60 µg groups: 7 
and 3 cases, respectively; Original/BA1. 15/15 µg and 30/30 µg groups: 1 and 6 cases, respectively.  
No cases meeting severe criteria per the FDA or CDC definition were observed in any of the vaccine 
groups. 
In substudy D approximately 640 participants ≥18 to ≤55 years of age received a fourth dose of either 
approved Original 30 µg or monovalent BA.1 30 µg about 4 month after the third dose. Superior 
immunogenicity to omicron BA.1 and non-inferior response to reference strain were demonstrated for 
BA.1 30 µg compared to the original vaccine.  
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The submitted studies were not designed to study vaccine efficacy. However, breakthrough COVID-19 
cases were captured by protocol. The study was performed in the US during 1-2Q 2022, when 
presumably BA.1 and BA.2 was circulating. Breakthrough infections occurred in all study arms. It 
remains uncertain to what extent the increase in neutralising titres against BA.1 would translate into 
increased protection against severe disease or against clinical disease, compared to the presently 
approved vaccine. 
Immune responses are generally stronger in younger people compared to older. Therefore, one can 
extrapolate that the booster effect of Original/BA.1 30µg against the BA.1 strain will be seen also in 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 137/142 
 
 
 
 
younger people, although data are only available from the abovementioned substudy D. In this a 
monovalent BA.1 vaccine at 30 µg elicited stronger responses against BA.1, compared to Original 
30µg. Whether the relative numerical increment in efficacy of Original/BA.1 compared to Original will 
be seen also for adults younger than 55, however, is unknown. These considerations are relevant also 
for adolescents 12-18 years of age.   
The data on immunogenicity against BA.5. were obtained with non-validated FFRNT assay. Moreover, it 
is not known if the numerically small increase in neutralising titres compared to that of the original 
product will be associated with improved relative efficacy 
No information about antibody kinetics over time after the fourth dose has been submitted.  
The current application only contains data on the use of Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg for a fourth 
total dose of Comirnaty. However, it is not anticipated that it would be in any way inferior to use the 
bivalent vaccine instead of the monovalent original vaccine for the third dose, or after four previous 
doses. It can also be anticipated that the bivalent vaccine could be used for booster regardless of the 
number of previous doses, once the two doses of primary vaccination have been given. 
Duration of protection is presently unknown, as is the future epidemiological situation with respect to 
variants. 
The applicant suggests the approved use of Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 µg after a primary series of 
any Covid-19 vaccine. However, data are only available after a primary series of Comirnaty. While the 
absence of data results in some uncertainty, it is likely that a clinically relevant boosting effect would 
be seen regardless of what vaccine was used for primary vaccination. 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety database of substudy E consists of 1841 individuals aged 55 years and above, who were 
followed up with solicited reactogenicity event reporting as described above. Of these 305 received 
Original/BA.1 15/15 µg. 
Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction in all study groups in substudy E. 
(58% Original/BA.1 15/15µg; 60% Original 30µg; 68% Original/BA.1 30/30µg). The majority of the 
local reactions were mild to moderate in severity. No grade 4 reaction were reported.  
The most frequently reported systemic reaction was fatigue for all tested vaccine variants (49% 
Original/BA.1 15/15µg; 45% Original 30µg; 57% Original/BA.1 30/30µg), followed by headache (34% 
Original/BA.1 15/15µg; 27% Original 30µg; 37% Original/BA.1 30/30µg), muscle pain (22% 
Original/BA.1. 15/15µg; 20% Original 30µg; 28% Original/BA.1 30/30µg), joint pain (11% 
Original/BA.1 15/15µg; 9% Original 30µg; 19% Original/BA.1 30/30µg) and fever (5% Original/BA.1 
15/15µg; 4% Original 30µg; 8% Original/BA.1 30/30µg).  
Four events of fever >38,9-40oC were reported in the group that received Original/BA.1 15/15µg 
vaccine, whereas none in the Original 30µg reported fever >38,9oC. The only event of fever >40,0oC 
was reported by a subject that received BA.1 60µg, in that group four events of fever >38,9-40oC was 
also reported.  Most of the systemic reactions in all groups were mild to moderate with a median time 
to onset of 2 days and resolved within a median time of one day. 
In substudy E, antipyretic or pain medication were used at similar frequency for the subject that 
received Original/BA.1 15/15 µg (29%) as for the subject that received Original 30µg (27%).  
No clinically relevant differences were noted in terms of local and systemic reactions in substudy E 
across all vaccine groups when evaluated by subgroups of race, ethnicity and baseline SARS-CoV-2 
status. There was a tendency to a slightly higher frequency reactogenicity reported among female 
Assessment report  
EMA/890789/2022 
Page 138/142 
 
 
 
 
subjects in all study arms, there was however no difference in severity and most of the events were 
mild or moderate. A similar trend was observed in the placebo-controlled phase 2/3 study C4591001 
for Original 30µg, where the same pattern was also noted in the placebo group. 
The local and systemic reactions reported among subjects >55 years of age that have received 
Original/BA.1 15/15µg in substudy E are reflected in the proposed section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The rate for any AEs up to the cut-off date for Original/BA.1 15/15µg was within the range seen for all 
tested vaccine variants (6.2%; (range; 3.9% (BA.1 60µg)-10.4% (Original/BA.1 30/30µg)). There 
were no AEs that led to death.  
Whereas there are safety data available for Omicron/BA.1 in those 55 years or older, the safety of a 
BA.1 vaccine variants in younger subjects has only been directly demonstrated in substudy D, for a 
monovalent vaccine at 30µg. The safety database from this study contained 640 individuals aged 18-
55 years randomised 1:1 to Original/BA.1 30µg or to Original 30µg, who were followed up as described 
above. 
In substudy D, pain at the injection site was the most common local reaction in both the BA.1 30µg 
and the Original 30µg arm (78% each). Fatigue was the most reported systemic reaction (64% BA.1 
30µg; 60% Original 30µg), followed by headache (48% BA.1 30µg; 45% Original 30µg), muscle pain 
(34% BA.1 30µg; 28% Original 30µg) and fever (9% BA.1 30µg; 6% Original 30µg).  
Most of the events were mild or moderate in severity and no Grade 4 systemic events were reported.  
Overall, the emerging safety profile is similar to that of Original 30ug. No new safety concerns have 
emerged. There were no cases of myocarditis. 
Uncertainties about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the size of the safety database for BA.1 containing variant vaccines is not large enough to 
characterise the frequency of rare adverse events. However, it is notable that the only difference 
between Original/BA.1 and Original, lies in the spike protein sequence of BA.1.  
Across studies, there is a tendency for numerically slightly higher frequencies of reactogenicity-related 
events with BA.1 containing vaccines. However, these differences are marginal and not deemed 
clinically meaningful. 
While reactogenicity and safety data are available for the bivalent Original/BA.1 vaccine variant in 
subjects aged 55 and higher, data are only available for a monovalent BA.1 vaccine variant at 30ug in 
subjects below this age. However, based on (a) a similar total dose of mRNA, (b) no relevant 
differences in reactogenicity between Original and Original/BA.1 in those aged above 55, and (c) no 
relevant differences in reactogenicity between Original and BA.1 in those below 55, the inference may 
be drawn that reactogenicity will be acceptable also in those below 55. 
There are no data on the bivalent Original/BA.1 variant vaccine in pregnancy. However, the total 
mRNA dose is the same as for Original, and reactogenicity is similar. Moreover, the only difference 
between products lies in the spike protein sequence. Therefore, a conclusion of acceptable safety in 
pregnancy and breast-feeding may be drawn for the vaccine variant. 
There are no safety data for the use of Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 as a third dose in total, as a fifth 
dose in total, or after a primary series with another Covid-19 vaccine. Moreover, there are no safety 
data for a repeat booster with Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15. However, there are no reasons to believe 
that the safety profile would differ substantially in any of these scenarios as this was not seen for the 
original.

Summary considerations 
While protection against severe Covid-19 remains relevant with the Original Comirnaty, efficacy 
against symptomatic disease due to omicron is clearly lower than was the case for the previous 
dominant variants. Based on the principles of immunology, greater protective efficacy may be 
conferred the closer a Sars-Cov-2 vaccine is to the circulating variant. Moreover, it is anticipated that 
Sars-Cov-2 will continue to evolve, and that an increased breadth of immunity is valuable. Therefore, a 
bivalent vaccine has been deemed desirable by regulatory bodies and public health authorities. 
The applicant has demonstrated that a bivalent Original/BA.1 vaccine at 15/15ug confers greater 
immunogenicity against BA.1, compared to the approved Original alone. While the precise size of any 
incremental efficacy (protection against clinical disease) is unknown, it appears reasonable to update 
vaccine composition as the virus evolves, analogous to what is done with influenza. 
While it is recognized that BA.1 is presently no longer the dominant strain, the present update is seen 
as a likely first step, where vaccine development will trace the evolution of the virus. Vaccine 
effectiveness will be followed in observational cohorts, which will also be used to understand breath of 
coverage and duration of protection. 
The reactogenicity of BA.1 containing vaccines do not differ substantially from Original, provided that 
the total mRNA dose is the same. While data for the bivalent vaccine are only available in those above 
55, a monovalent BA.1 vaccine variant was studied in younger adults, also yielding a clinically similar 
reactogenicity profile. Consequently, a substantially different safety profile in adolescents or younger 
adults, compared to the available Comirnaty Original, is considered sufficiently unlikely to permit 
approvability. 
The Omicron/BA.1 15/15µg variant is presently under study in subjects 18-55 years of age. The 
applicant has committed to deliver the immunogenicity and safety results of this trial, as a post-
marketing commitment. 
There are no data to support the use of this product for primary vaccination. Therefore, it should be 
clear from the indication statement that use is only for subjects that have completed a primary 
vaccination series. 
Based on cumulative experience of mRNA vaccines, it is sufficiently likely that a relevant boosting 
effect will be seen regardless of what vaccine was used for the primary vaccination series. Given the 
variability of primary series and boosters that have been given to EU patients, there is a need for 
flexibility. Therefore, it is agreed that the product may be used for boosting regardless of which prior 
vaccinations, and that no restrictions are needed with respect to the specifics of prior vaccinations.  
Moreover, safety and immunogenicity are not likely to differ substantially if the product is given as a 
repeat booster, as long as a sufficient interval between doses is maintained. This has previously been 
determined to at least 3 months for Comirnaty. Whether or not to use this particular product for a 
repeat boost, would depend on the epidemiological situation and observational data indicating waning 
immunity. 
Based on the above considerations, the following indication is proposed: 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15 micrograms/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection is 
indicated for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 12 
years of age and older who have previously received at least primary vaccination against COVID-19. 
(See sections 4.2 and 5.1.)  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

EMA/890789/2022 
Page 140/142 
 
 
 
 
 
In summary, the B/R for the Original/BA.1 15/15µg could be positive in adolescents 12 years and 
above, and adult subjects, provided that the indication statement is adjusted in line with what is 
suggested above. Moreover, the conditions for use per SmPC need to be agreed, solving the above-
mentioned issues. 
The benefit-risk balance of COMIRNATY remains positive.

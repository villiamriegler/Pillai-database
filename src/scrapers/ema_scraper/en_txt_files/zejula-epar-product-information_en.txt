CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Zejula is indicated: 
• 
• 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO 
Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed 
high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration  
Treatment with Zejula should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
Posology 
First-line ovarian cancer maintenance treatment 
The recommended starting dose of Zejula is 200 mg (two 100-mg capsules), taken once daily. 
However, for those patients who weigh ≥ 77 kg and have baseline platelet count ≥ 150,000/μL, the 
recommended starting dose of Zejula is 300 mg (three 100-mg capsules), taken once daily (see section 
4.4 and 4.8). 
Recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance treatment 
The dose is three 100 mg hard capsules once daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 300 mg. 
Patients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. Bedtime 
administration may be a potential method for managing nausea.

It is recommended that treatment should be continued until disease progression or toxicity. 
Missing dose 
If patients miss a dose, they should take their next dose at its regularly scheduled time. 
Dose adjustments for adverse reactions 
The recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3. 
In general, it is recommended to first interrupt the treatment (but no longer than 28 consecutive days) 
to allow the patient to recover from the adverse reaction and then restart at the same dose. In the case 
that the adverse reaction recurs, it is recommended to interrupt the treatment and then resume at the 
lower dose. If adverse reactions persist beyond a 28-day dose interruption, it is recommended that 
Zejula be discontinued. If adverse reactions are not manageable with this strategy of dose interruption 
and reduction, it is recommended that Zejula be discontinued.

Table 3: Dose modifications for haematologic adverse reactions 
Haematologic adverse reactions have been observed during the treatment with Zejula especially 
during the initial phase of the treatment. It is therefore recommended to monitor complete blood 
counts (CBCs) weekly during the first month of treatment and modify the dose as needed. After the 
first month, it is recommended to monitor CBCs monthly and periodically after this time (see 
section 4.4). Based on individual laboratory values, weekly monitoring for the second month may 
be warranted. 
• 
Haematologic adverse reaction 
requiring transfusion or 
haematopoietic growth factor 
support 
For patients with platelet count ≤ 10,000/μL, platelet 
transfusion should be considered. If there are other risk 
factors for bleeding such as co-administration of 
anticoagulation or antiplatelet medicinal products, 
consider interrupting these substances and/or 
transfusion at a higher platelet count. 
Resume Zejula at a reduced dose. 
• 
First occurrence: 
•  Withhold Zejula for a maximum of 28 days and monitor 
blood counts weekly until platelet counts return to 
≥ 100,000/µL. 
Resume Zejula at same or reduced dose per Table 1 
based on clinical evaluation. 
If platelet count is < 75,000/μL at any time, resume at a 
reduced dose per Table 1.  
• 
• 
Platelet count < 100,000/μL 
Neutrophil < 1,000/µL or 
Haemoglobin < 8 g/dL 
Second occurrence: 
•  Withhold Zejula for a maximum of 28 days and monitor 
blood counts weekly until platelet counts return 
to ≥ 100,000/µL. 
Resume Zejula at a reduced dose per Table 1. 
Discontinue Zejula if the platelet count has not returned 
to acceptable levels within 28 days of the dose 
interruption period, or if the patient has already 
undergone dose reduction to 100 mg QD. 
• 
• 
•  Withhold Zejula for a maximum of 28 days and monitor 
blood counts weekly until neutrophil counts return 
to ≥ 1,500/µL or haemoglobin returns to ≥ 9 g/dL. 
Resume Zejula at a reduced dose per Table 1. 
Discontinue Zejula if neutrophils and/or haemoglobin 
have not returned to acceptable levels within 28 days of 
the dose interruption period, or if the patient has already 
undergone dose reduction to 100 mg QD. 
• 
• 
Confirmed diagnosis of 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
or acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML) 
• 
Permanently discontinue Zejula. 
Patients with low body weight in recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance treatment 
Approximately 25% of patients in the NOVA study weighed less than 58 kg, and approximately 25% 
of patients weighed more than 77 kg. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (ADRs) was 
greater among low body weight patients (78%) than high body weight patients (53%). Only 13% of 
low body weight patients remained at a dose of 300 mg beyond Cycle 3. A starting dose of 200 mg for 
patients weighing less than 58 kg may be considered. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (≥ 65 years). There are limited clinical data in 
patients aged 75 or over. 
4 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. There are no 
data in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis; use 
with caution in these patients (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (either aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) > upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin (TB) ≤ ULN or any AST 
and TB > 1.0 x – 1,5 x ULN). For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (any AST and TB > 1.5 
x - 3 x ULN) the recommended starting dose of Zejula is 200 mg once daily. There are no data in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (any AST and TB > 3 x ULN); use with caution in these 
patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Patients with ECOG performance status 2 to 4 
Clinical data are not available in patients with ECOG performance status 2 to 4. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of niraparib in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Zejula is for oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. The capsules should not be 
chewed or crushed. 
Zejula capsules can be taken without regard to meals (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haematologic adverse reactions 
Haematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia) have been reported in 
patients treated with Zejula (see section 4.8). Patients with lower body weight or lower baseline 
platelet count may be at increased risk of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia (see section 4.2). 
Testing complete blood counts weekly for the first month, followed by monthly monitoring for the 
next 10 months of treatment and periodically after this time is recommended to monitor for clinically 
significant changes in any haematologic parameter during treatment (see section 4.2). 
If a patient develops severe persistent haematologic toxicity including pancytopenia that does not 
resolve within 28 days following interruption, Zejula should be discontinued. 
Due to the risk of thrombocytopenia, anticoagulants and medicinal products known to reduce the 
thrombocyte count should be used with caution (see section 4.8). 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia 
Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML), including cases with fatal 
outcome, have been observed in patients treated with Zejula monotherapy or combination therapy in 
clinical trials and postmarketing (see section 4.8). 
In clinical trials, the duration of Zejula treatment in patients prior to developing MDS/AML varied 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from 0.5 months to > 4.9 years. The cases were typical of secondary, cancer therapy-related 
MDS/AML. All patients had received platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens and many had also 
received other DNA damaging agents and radiotherapy. Some of the patients had a history of bone 
marrow suppression. In the NOVA trial, the incidence of MDS/AML was higher in the gBRCAmut 
cohort (7.4%) than in the non-gBRCAmut cohort (1.7%). 
For suspected MDS/AML or prolonged haematological toxicities, the patient should be referred to a 
haematologist for further evaluation. If MDS/AML is confirmed, Zejula treatment should be 
discontinued and the patient treated appropriately. 
Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis 
Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported with the use of Zejula (see section 4.8). 
Pre-existing hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Zejula treatment. Blood 
pressure should be monitored at least weekly for two months, monitored monthly afterwards for the 
first year and periodically thereafter during treatment with Zejula. Home blood pressure monitoring 
may be considered for appropriate patients with instruction to contact their health care provider in case 
of rise in blood pressure. 
Hypertension should be medically managed with antihypertensive medicinal products as well as 
adjustment of the Zejula dose (see section 4.2), if necessary. In the clinical programme, blood pressure 
measurements were obtained on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle while the patient remained on Zejula. In 
most cases, hypertension was controlled adequately using standard antihypertensive treatment with or 
without Zejula dose adjustment (see section 4.2). Zejula should be discontinued in case of 
hypertensive crisis or if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately controlled with 
antihypertensive therapy. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving Zejula (see section 4.8). PRES is a rare, 
reversible, neurological disorder which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including 
seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without 
associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
In case of PRES, it is recommended to discontinue Zejula and to treat specific symptoms including 
hypertension. The safety of reinitiating Zejula therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not 
known. 
Pregnancy/contraception 
Zejula should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not willing to use 
highly effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of Zejula 
(see section 4.6). A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing potential prior 
to treatment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment could have increased exposure of niraparib based on data 
from patients with moderate hepatic impairment and should be carefully monitored (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
Lactose 
Zejula hard capsules contain lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

Tartrazine (E 102) 
This medicinal product contains tartrazine (E 102), which may cause allergic reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
The combination of niraparib with vaccines or immunosuppressant agents has not been studied. 
The data on niraparib in combination with cytotoxic medicinal products are limited. Therefore, caution 
should be taken if niraparib is used in combination with vaccines, immunosuppressant agents or with 
other cytotoxic medicinal products. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Effect of other medicinal products on niraparib 
Niraparib as a substrate of CYPs (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4)  
Niraparib is a substrate of carboxylesterases (CEs) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in vivo. 
Oxidative metabolism of niraparib is minimal in vivo. No dose adjustment for Zejula is required when 
administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit (e.g. itraconazole, ritonavir, and 
clarithromycin) or induce CYP enzymes (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin). 
Niraparib as a substrate of efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, and MATE1/2)  
Niraparib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
However, due to its high permeability and bioavailability, the risk of clinically relevant interactions 
with medicinal products that inhibit these transporters is unlikely. Therefore, no dose adjustment for 
Zejula is required when administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit P-gp 
(e.g. amiodarone, verapamil) or BCRP (e.g. osimertinib, velpatasvir, and eltrombopag). 
Niraparib is not a substrate of bile salt export pump (BSEP), or multidrug resistance-associated protein 
2 (MRP2). The major primary metabolite M1 is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, or MRP2. 
Niraparib is not a substrate of multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)-1 or 2, while M1 is a substrate 
of both. 
Niraparib as a substrate of hepatic uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1) 
Neither niraparib nor M1 is a substrate of organic anion transport polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), 1B3 
(OATP1B3), or organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1). No dose adjustment for Zejula is required when 
administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit OATP1B1 or 1B3 (e.g. 
gemfibrozil, ritonavir), or OCT1 (e.g. dolutegravir) uptake transporters. 
Niraparib as a substrate of renal uptake transporters (OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2)  
Neither niraparib nor M1 is a substrate of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), 3 (OAT3), and organic 
cation transporter 2 (OCT2). No dose adjustment for Zejula is required when administered 
concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit OAT1 (e.g. probenecid) or OAT3 (e.g. 
probenecid, diclofenac), or OCT2 uptake transporters (e.g. cimetidine, quinidine). 
Effect of niraparib on other medicinal products  
Inhibition of CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) 
Neither niraparib nor M1 is an inhibitor of any active substance-metabolising CYP enzymes, namely 
CYP1A1/2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. 
Even though inhibition of CYP3A4 in the liver is not expected, the potential to inhibit CYP3A4 at the 
intestinal level has not been established at relevant niraparib concentrations. Therefore, caution is 
recommended when niraparib is combined with active substances the metabolism of which is 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP3A4-dependent and, notably, those having a narrow therapeutic range (e.g. ciclosporin, 
tacrolimus, alfentanil, ergotamine, pimozide, quetiapine, and halofantrine). 
Inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 
Niraparib did not exhibit inhibitory effect against the UGT isoforms (UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A9, 
and UGT2B7) up to 200 µM in vitro. Therefore, the potential for a clinically relevant inhibition of 
UGTs by niraparib is minimal. 
Induction of CYPs (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4)  
Neither niraparib nor M1 is a CYP3A4 inducer in vitro. In vitro, niraparib weakly induces CYP1A2 at 
high concentrations and the clinical relevance of this effect could not be completely ruled out. M1 is 
not a CYP1A2 inducer. Therefore, caution is recommended when niraparib is combined with active 
substances the metabolism of which is CYP1A2-dependent and, notably, those having a narrow 
therapeutic range (e.g. clozapine, theophylline, and ropinirole). 
Inhibition of efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, and MATE1/2)  
Niraparib is not an inhibitor of BSEP or MRP2. In vitro, niraparib inhibits P-gp very weakly and 
BCRP with an IC50 = 161 µM and 5.8 µM, respectively. Therefore, a clinically meaningful interaction 
related to an inhibition of these efflux transporters, although unlikely, cannot be excluded. Caution is 
then recommended when niraparib is combined with substrates of BCRP (irinotecan, rosuvastatin, 
simvastatin, atorvastatin, and methotrexate). 
Niraparib is an inhibitor of MATE1 and -2 with IC50 of 0.18 µM and ≤ 0.14 µM, respectively. 
Increased plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates of these 
transporters (e.g. metformin) cannot be excluded. 
The major primary metabolite M1 does not appear to be an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2 or 
MATE1/2. 
Inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1)  
Neither niraparib nor M1 is an inhibitor of organic anion transport polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) or 
1B3 (OATP1B3). 
In vitro, niraparib weakly inhibits the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) with an IC50 = 34.4 µM. 
Caution is recommended when niraparib is combined with active substances that undergo an uptake 
transport by OCT1 such as metformin. 
Inhibition of renal uptake transporters (OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2)  
Neither niraparib nor M1 inhibits organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), 3 (OAT3), and organic cation 
transporter 2 (OCT2). 
All clinical studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while on treatment and should not be 
pregnant at the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of 
childbearing potential prior to treatment. Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective 
contraception during therapy and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of Zejula. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of niraparib in pregnant women. Animal 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted. However, based on its 
mechanism of action, niraparib could cause embryonic or foetal harm, including embryo-lethal and 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
teratogenic effects, when administered to a pregnant woman. Zejula should not be used during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether niraparib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding is 
contraindicated during administration of Zejula and for 1 month after receiving the last dose (see 
section 4.3). 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on fertility. A reversible reduction of spermatogenesis was observed in rats 
and dogs (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Zejula has moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Patients who take Zejula may 
experience asthenia, fatigue, dizziness or difficulties concentrating. Patients who experience these 
symptoms should observe caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
ADRs of all grades occurring in ≥ 10% of the 851 patients receiving Zejula monotherapy in the pooled 
PRIMA (either 200 mg or 300 mg starting dose) and NOVA trials were nausea, anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, fatigue, constipation, vomiting, headache, insomnia, platelet count decreased, 
neutropenia, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, hypertension, asthenia, 
dizziness, neutrophil count decreased, cough, arthralgia, back pain, white blood cell count decreased, 
and hot flush. 
The most common serious adverse reactions > 1% (treatment-emergent frequencies) were 
thrombocytopenia and anaemia. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been identified based on clinical trials and post-marketing 
surveillance in patients receiving Zejula monotherapy (see Table 4). Frequencies of occurrence of 
undesirable effects are based on pooled adverse events data generated from the PRIMA and NOVA 
studies (fixed starting dose of 300 mg/day) where patient exposure is known and defined as: very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 
to < 1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The adverse reactions noted in the group of patients who were administered a 200 mg starting dose of 
Zejula based on baseline weight or platelet count were of similar or lesser frequency compared to the 
group administered a fixed starting dose of 300 mg (Table 4). 
See below for specific information regarding frequency of thrombocytopenia, anaemia and 
neutropenia. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Haematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia) including clinical 
diagnoses and/or laboratory findings generally occurred early during niraparib treatment with the 
incidence decreasing over time. 
In the NOVA and PRIMA studies, patients eligible for Zejula therapy had the following baseline 
haematologic parameters: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/µL; platelets ≥ 100,000 
cells/µL and haemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (NOVA) or ≥ 10 g/dL (PRIMA) prior to therapy. In the clinical 
programme, haematologic adverse reactions were managed with laboratory monitoring and dose 
modifications (see section 4.2). 
In PRIMA, patients who were administered a starting dose of Zejula based on baseline weight or 
platelet count, Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, anaemia and neutropenia were reduced from 48% to 21%, 
36% to 23% and 24% to 15%, respectively, compared to the group administered a fixed starting dose 
of 300 mg. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and neutropenia occurred, 
respectively, in 3%, 3%, and 2% of patients. 
Thrombocytopenia 
In PRIMA, 39% of Zejula-treated patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia compared to 
0.4% of placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 22 days (range: 15 
to 335 days) and with a median duration of 6 days (range: 1 to 374 days). Discontinuation due to 
thrombocytopenia occurred in 4% of patients receiving niraparib. 
In NOVA, approximately 60% of patients receiving Zejula experienced thrombocytopenia of any 
grade, and 34% of patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. In patients with baseline platelet 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
count less than 180 × 109/L, thrombocytopenia of any grade and Grade 3/4 occurred in 76% and 45% 
of the patients, respectively. The median time to onset of thrombocytopenia regardless of grade and 
Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 22 and 23 days, respectively. The rate of new incidences of 
thrombocytopenia after intensive dose modifications were performed during the first two months of 
treatment from Cycle 4 was 1.2%. The median duration of thrombocytopenia events of any grade was 
23 days, and the median duration of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 10 days. Patients treated with 
Zejula who develop thrombocytopenia might have an increased risk of haemorrhage. In the clinical 
programme, thrombocytopenia was managed with laboratory monitoring, dose modification and 
platelet transfusion where appropriate (see section 4.2). Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia 
events (thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) occurred in approximately 3% of the patients. 
In the NOVA study, 48 of 367 (13%) of patients experienced bleeding with concurrent 
thrombocytopenia; all bleeding events concurrent with thrombocytopenia were Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity except for one event of Grade 3 petechiae and haematoma observed concurrently with a 
serious adverse reaction of pancytopenia. Thrombocytopenia occurred more commonly in patients 
whose baseline platelet count was less than 180 × 109/L. Approximately 76% of patients with lower 
baseline platelets (< 180 × 109/L) who received Zejula experienced thrombocytopenia of any grade, 
and 45% of the patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Pancytopenia has been observed 
in < 1% of patients receiving niraparib. 
Anaemia 
In PRIMA, 31% of Zejula-treated patients experienced Grade 3/4 anaemia compared to 2% of 
placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 80 days (range: 15 to 533 
days) and with a median duration of 7 days (range: 1 to 119 days). Discontinuation due to anaemia 
occurred in 2% of patients receiving niraparib. 
In NOVA, approximately 50% of patients experienced anaemia of any grade, and 25% experienced 
Grade 3/4 anaemia. The median time to onset of anaemia of any grade was 42 days, and 85 days for 
Grade 3/4 events. The median duration of anaemia of any grade was 63 days, and 8 days for Grade 3/4 
events. Anaemia of any grade might persist during Zejula treatment. In the clinical programme, 
anaemia was managed with laboratory monitoring, dose modification (see section 4.2), and where 
appropriate with red blood cell transfusions. Discontinuation due to anaemia occurred in 1% of 
patients. 
Neutropenia 
In PRIMA, 21% of Zejula-treated patients experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia compared to 1% of 
placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 29 days (range: 15 to 421 
days) and with a median duration of 8 days (range: 1 to 42 days). Discontinuation due to neutropenia 
occurred in 2% of patients receiving niraparib. 
In NOVA, approximately 30% of patients receiving Zejula experienced neutropenia of any grade, and 
20% of patients experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia. The median time to onset of neutropenia of any 
grade was 27 days, and 29 days for Grade 3/4 events. The median duration of neutropenia of any grade 
was 26 days, and 13 days for Grade 3/4 events. In addition, Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor 
(G-CSF) was administered to approximately 6% of patients treated with niraparib as concomitant 
therapy for neutropenia. Discontinuation due to neutropenia events occurred in 2% of patients. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myeloid leukaemia 
In clinical studies, MDS/AML occurred in 1% patients treated with Zejula, with 41% of cases having a 
fatal outcome. The incidence was higher in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer who had received 2 
or more lines of prior platinum chemotherapy and with gBRCAmut following 75 months survival 
follow-up. All patients had potential contributing factors for the development of MDS/AML, having 
received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents. Many had also received other DNA damaging 
agents and radiotherapy. The majority of reports were in gBRCAmut carriers. Some of the patients had 
a history of previous cancer or of bone marrow suppression. 
In the PRIMA study, the incidence of MDS/AML was 0.8% in patients receiving Zejula and 0.4% in 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients received placebo. 
In the NOVA study in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer who had received at least two prior lines 
of platinum chemotherapy, the overall incidence of MDS/AML was 3.8% in patients receiving Zejula 
and 1.7% in patients receiving placebo at a follow-up of 75 months. In gBRCAmut and non-
gBRCAmut cohorts, the incidence of MDS/AML was 7.4% and 1.7% in patients receiving Zejula and 
3.1% and 0.9% in patients receiving placebo, respectively. 
Hypertension 
In PRIMA, Grade 3/4 hypertension occurred in 6% of Zejula-treated patients compared to 1% of 
placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 50 days (range: 1 to 589 
days) and with a median duration of 12 days (range: 1 to 61 days). Discontinuation due to 
hypertension occurred in 0% of patients. 
In NOVA, hypertension of any grade occurred in 19.3% of patients treated with Zejula. Grade 3/4 
hypertension occurred in 8.2% of patients. Hypertension was readily managed with anti-hypertensive 
medicinal products. Discontinuation due to hypertension occurred in < 1% of patients. 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted in paediatric patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific treatment in the event of Zejula overdose, and symptoms of overdose are not 
established. In the event of an overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and 
should treat symptomatically.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XK02. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Niraparib is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2, 
which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may 
involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes 
resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was 
observed in tumour cell lines with or without deficiencies in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) 1 and 2 
tumour suppressor genes. In orthotopic high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient-derived xenograft 
tumours (PDX) grown in mice, niraparib has been shown to reduce tumour growth in BRCA 1 and 2 
mutant, BRCA wild-type but homologous recombination (HR) deficient, and in tumours that are BRCA 
wild-type and without detectable HR deficiency. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
First-line ovarian cancer maintenance treatment  
PRIMA was a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients (n = 733) in complete 
or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were randomised 2:1 to niraparib or 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
matched placebo. PRIMA was initiated with a starting dose of 300 mg QD in 475 patients (whereof 
317 was randomised to the niraparib arm vs 158 in the placebo arm) in continuous 28-day cycles. The 
starting dose in PRIMA was changed with Amendment 2 of the Protocol. From that point forward, 
patients with a baseline body weight ≥77 kg and baseline platelet count ≥150,000/µL were 
administered niraparib 300 mg (n = 34) or placebo daily (n = 21) while patients with a baseline body 
weight <77 kg or baseline platelet count <150,000/μL were administered niraparib 200 mg (n = 122) 
or placebo daily (n = 61). 
Patients were randomised post completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy plus/minus 
surgery. Subjects were randomised within 12 weeks of the first day of the last cycle of chemotherapy. 
Subjects had ≥6 and ≤9 cycles of platinum-based therapy. Following interval debulking surgery 
subjects had ≥2 post-operative cycles of platinum-based therapy. Patients who had received 
bevacizumab with chemotherapy but could not receive bevacizumab as maintenance therapy were not 
excluded from the study. Patients could not have received prior PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapy, 
including niraparib. Patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking 
surgery could have visible residual or no residual disease. Patients with Stage III disease who had 
complete cytoreduction (i.e., no visible residual disease) after primary debulking surgery were 
excluded. Randomisation was stratified by best response during the front-line platinum regimen 
(complete response vs partial response), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) (Yes vs No); and 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status [positive (HR deficient) vs negative (HR 
proficient) or not determined]. Testing for HRD was performed using the HRD test on tumour tissue 
obtained at the time of initial diagnosis. The CA-125 levels should be in the normal range (or a CA-
125 decrease by > 90%) during the patient’s front-line therapy, and be stable for at least 7 days.  
Patients began treatment on Cycle 1/Day 1 (C1/D1) with niraparib 200 or 300 mg or matched placebo 
administered QD in continuous 28-day cycles. Clinic visits occurred each cycle (4 weeks ± 3 days). 
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), as determined by blinded independent 
central review (BICR) per RECIST, version 1.1. Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary objective. 
PFS testing was performed hierarchically: first in the HR deficient population, then in the overall 
population. The median age of 62 ranged from 32 to 85 years among patients randomised with 
niraparib and 33 to 88 years among patients randomised with placebo. Eighty-nine percent of all 
patients were white. Sixty-nine percent of patients randomised with niraparib and 71% of patients 
randomised with placebo had an ECOG of 0 at study baseline. In the overall population, 65% of 
patients had stage III disease and 35% had stage IV disease. In the overall population, the primary 
tumour site in most patients (≥ 80%) was the ovary; most patients (> 90%) had tumours with serous 
histology. Sixty-seven percent of the patients received NACT. Sixty-nine percent of the patients had a 
complete response to the first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. A total of 6 niraparib patients had 
received bevacizumab as prior treatment for their ovarian cancer. 
PRIMA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomised to 
niraparib as compared with placebo in the HR deficient and overall population (Table 5, and Figures 1 
and 2). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS after the first subsequent therapy (PFS2) and OS 
(Table 5).

Subgroup analyses  
Within the HR deficient population, a hazard ratio of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.62) was observed in the 
subgroup of patients with BRCAmut ovarian cancer (N = 223). In the subgroup of HR deficient 
patients without a BRCA mutation (N = 150), a hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.83) was 
observed. In the HR proficient population (N = 249), a hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.94) was 
observed. 
In exploratory subgroup analyses of patients who were administered 200 or 300 mg dose of Zejula 
based on baseline weight or platelet count, comparable efficacy (investigator-assessed PFS) was 
observed with a hazard ratio of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.91) in the HR deficient population, and with a 
hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.94) in the overall population. In the HR proficient subgroup, the 
dose of 200 mg appeared to give a lower treatment effect compared to the 300 mg dose. 
Platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance treatment 
The safety and efficacy of niraparib as maintenance therapy was studied in a Phase 3 randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled international trial (NOVA) in patients with relapsed predominantly 
high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who were platinum 
sensitive, defined by complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for more than six months to 
their penultimate (next to last) platinum-based therapy. To be eligible for niraparib treatment, the 
patient should be in response (CR or PR) following completion of last platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The CA-125 levels should be normal (or a > 90% decrease in CA-125 from baseline) following their 
last platinum treatment, and be stable for at least 7 days. Patients could not have received prior PARPi 
therapy, including Zejula. Eligible patients were assigned to one of two cohorts based on the results of 
a germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutation test. Within each cohort, patients were randomised using a 2:1 
allocation of niraparib and placebo. Patients were assigned to the gBRCAmut cohort based on blood 
samples for gBRCA analysis that were taken prior to randomisation. Testing for tumour BRCA 
(tBRCA) mutation and HRD was performed using the HRD test on tumour tissue obtained at the time 
of initial diagnosis or at the time of recurrence. 
Randomisation within each cohort was stratified by time to progression after the penultimate platinum 
therapy before study enrolment (6 to < 12 months and ≥ 12 months); use or not of bevacizumab in

conjunction with the penultimate or last platinum regimen; and best response during the most recent 
platinum regimen (complete response and partial response).  
Patients began treatment on Cycle 1/Day 1 (C1/D1) with niraparib 300 mg or matched placebo 
administered QD in continuous 28-day cycles. Clinic visits occurred each cycle (4 weeks ± 3 days). 
In the NOVA study, 48% of patients had a dose interruption in Cycle 1. Approximately 47% of 
patients restarted at a reduced dose in Cycle 2. 
The most commonly used dose in niraparib-treated patients in the NOVA study was 200 mg. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was determined per RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors, version 1.1) or clinical signs and symptoms and increased CA-125. PFS was measured from 
the time of randomisation (which occurred up to 8 weeks after completion of the chemotherapy 
regimen) to disease progression or death. 
The primary efficacy analysis for PFS was determined by blinded central independent assessment and 
was prospectively defined and assessed for the gBRCAmut cohort and the non-gBRCAmut cohort 
separately. Overall survival (OS) analyses were secondary outcome measures. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included chemotherapy-free interval (CFI), time to first subsequent 
therapy (TFST), PFS after the first subsequent therapy (PFS2), and OS. 
Demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior treatment history were generally well 
balanced between the niraparib and placebo arms in the gBRCAmut (n = 203) and the non-gBRCAmut 
cohorts (n = 350). Median ages ranged from 57 to 63 years across treatments and cohorts. The primary 
tumour site in most patients (> 80%) within each cohort was the ovary; most patients (> 84%) had 
tumours with serous histology. A high proportion of patients in both treatment arms in both cohorts 
had received 3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy, including 49% and 34% of niraparib patients in 
the gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut cohorts, respectively. Most patients were age 18 to 64 years 
(78%), Caucasian (86%) and had an ECOG performance status of 0 (68%). 
In the gBRCAmut cohort, the median number of treatment cycles was higher in the niraparib arm than 
the placebo arm (14 and 7 cycles, respectively). More patients in the niraparib group continued 
treatment for more than 12 months than patients in the placebo group (54.4% and 16.9% 
respectively).In the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort, the median number of treatment cycles was higher 
in the niraparib arm than in the placebo arm (8 and 5 cycles, respectively). More patients in the 
niraparib group continued treatment for more than 12 months than patients in the placebo group 
(34.2% and 21.1%, respectively). 
The study met its primary objective of statistically significantly improved PFS for niraparib 
maintenance monotherapy compared with placebo in the gBRCAmut cohort as well as in the overall 
non-gBRCAmut cohort. Table 6 and Figures 3 and 4 show the results for the PFS primary endpoint for 
the primary efficacy populations (gBRCAmut cohort and the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort).

Secondary efficacy endpoints in NOVA 
At the final analysis, the median PFS2 in the gBRCAmut cohort was 29.9 months for patients treated 
with niraparib compared to 22.7 months for patients on placebo (HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97). The 
median PFS2 in the non-gBRCAmut cohort was 19.5 months for patients treated with niraparib 
compared to 16.1 months for patients on placebo (HR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.02). 
At the final analysis of overall survival, the median OS in the gBRCAmut cohort (n = 203) was 40.9 
months for patients treated with niraparib compared with 38.1 months for patients on placebo 
(HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.20). The cohort maturity for the gBRCAmut cohort was 76%. The median 
OS in the non-gBRCAmut cohort (n = 350) was 31.0 months for patients treated with niraparib 
compared with 34.8 months for patients on placebo (HR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.37). The cohort 
maturity for the non-gBRCAmut cohort was 79%. 
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from validated survey tools (FOSI and EQ-5D) indicate that 
niraparib-treated patients reported no difference from placebo in measures associated with quality of 
life (QoL). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Zejula 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in ovarian carcinoma (excluding rhabdomyosarcoma and 
germ cell tumours). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Following a single-dose administration of 300 mg niraparib under fasting conditions, niraparib was 
measurable in plasma within 30 minutes and the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for niraparib 
was reached in about 3 hours [804 ng/mL (% CV: 50.2%)]. Following multiple oral doses of niraparib 
from 30 mg to 400 mg once daily, accumulation of niraparib was approximately 2 to 3 folds. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The systemic exposures (Cmax and AUC) to niraparib increased in a dose-proportional manner when 
the dose of niraparib increased from 30 mg to 400 mg. The absolute bioavailability of niraparib is 
approximately 73%, indicating minimal first pass effect. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
niraparib, the inter-individual variability in bioavailability was estimated to a coefficient of variation 
(CV) of 31%. 
A concomitant high-fat meal did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of niraparib after 
administration of 300 mg of niraparib capsule. 
The tablet and capsule formulations have been demonstrated to be bioequivalent. Following 
administration of either one 300 mg tablet or three 100 mg capsules of niraparib in 108 patients with 
solid tumours under fasting conditions, the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios for 
tablet compared to capsules for Cmax, AUClast and AUC∞ fell within the limits of bioequivalence (0.80 
and 1.25). 
Distribution 
Niraparib was moderately protein bound in human plasma (83%), mainly with serum albumin. In a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of niraparib, the apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 
1,311 L (based on a 70 kg patient) in cancer patients (CV 116%), indicating extensive tissue 
distribution of niraparib. 
Biotransformation 
Niraparib is metabolised primarily by carboxylesterases (CEs) to form a major inactive metabolite, 
M1. In a mass balance study, M1 and M10 (the subsequently formed M1 glucuronides) were the major 
circulating metabolites. 
Elimination 
Following a single oral 300-mg dose of niraparib, the mean terminal half-life (t½) of niraparib ranged 
from 48 to 51 hours (approximately 2 days). In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent 
total clearance (CL/F) of niraparib was 16.5 L/h in cancer patients (CV 23.4%). 
Niraparib is eliminated primarily through the hepatobiliary and renal routes. Following an oral 
administration of a single 300-mg dose of [14C]-niraparib, on average 86.2% (range 71% to 91%) of 
the dose was recovered in urine and faeces over 21 days. Radioactive recovery in the urine accounted 
for 47.5% (range 33.4% to 60.2%) and in the faeces for 38.8% (range 28.3% to 47%) of the dose. In 
pooled samples collected over 6 days, 40% of the dose was recovered in the urine primarily as 
metabolites and 31.6% of the dose was recovered in the faeces primarily as unchanged niraparib. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, patients with mild (creatinine clearance 60-90 mL/min) 
and moderate (30-60 mL/min) renal impairment had mildly reduced niraparib clearance compared to 
individuals with normal renal function (7-17% higher exposure in mild and 17-38% higher exposure in 
moderate renal impairment). The difference in exposure is not considered to warrant dose adjustment. 
No patients with pre-existing severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease undergoing 
hemodialysis were identified in clinical studies (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from clinical studies in patients, pre-existing mild 
hepatic impairment (n = 155) did not influence the clearance of niraparib. In a clinical study of cancer 
patients using NCI-ODWG criteria to classify the degree of hepatic impairment, niraparib AUCinf in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n = 8) was 1.56 (90% CI: 1.06, 2.30) times the niraparib 
AUCinf in patients with normal hepatic function (n = 9) following administration of a single 300 mg 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose. Niraparib dose adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2). Moderate hepatic impairment did not have an effect on niraparib Cmax or on niraparib 
protein binding. The pharmacokinetics of niraparib have not been assessed in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Weight, age and race 
Increasing weight was found to increase niraparib volume of distribution in the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. No impact of weight was identified on niraparib clearance or overall 
exposure. Dose adjustment according to body weight is not warranted from a pharmacokinetic point of 
view. 
Increasing age was found to decrease niraparib clearance in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
The average exposure in a 91-year old patient was predicted to be 23% higher than in a 30-year old 
patient. The impact of age is not considered to warrant dose adjustment. 
There is insufficient data across races to conclude on the impact of race on niraparib 
pharmacokinetics. 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of niraparib in paediatric patients. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data  
Safety pharmacology 
In vitro, niraparib inhibited the dopamine transporter DAT at concentration levels below human 
exposure levels. In mice, single doses of niraparib increased intracellular levels of dopamine and 
metabolites in cortex. Reduced locomotor activity was seen in one of two single dose studies in mice. 
The clinical relevance of these findings is not known. No effect on behavioural and/or neurological 
parameters have been observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs at estimated CNS 
exposure levels similar to or below expected therapeutic exposure levels. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Decreased spermatogenesis was observed in rats and dogs at exposure levels below those seen 
clinically and was largely reversible within 4 weeks of cessation of dosing. 
Genotoxicity 
Niraparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) test but was clastogenic in 
an in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration assay and in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus 
assay. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary 
pharmacology of niraparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in humans. 
Reproductive toxicology 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with niraparib. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with niraparib.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Zejula is indicated:  
• 
• 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO 
Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed 
high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration  
Treatment with Zejula should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
Posology 
First-line ovarian cancer maintenance treatment 
The recommended starting dose of Zejula is 200 mg (two 100-mg tablets), taken once daily. However, 
for those patients who weigh ≥ 77 kg and have baseline platelet count ≥ 150,000/μL, the 
recommended starting dose of Zejula is 300 mg (three 100-mg tablets), taken once daily (see section 
4.4 and 4.8). 
Recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance treatment 
The dose is three 100 mg tablets once daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 300 mg. 
Patients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. Bedtime 
administration may be a potential method for managing nausea. 
It is recommended that treatment should be continued until disease progression or toxicity.

Missing dose 
If patients miss a dose, they should take their next dose at its regularly scheduled time. 
Dose adjustments for adverse reactions 
The recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3. 
In general, it is recommended to first interrupt the treatment (but no longer than 28 consecutive days) 
to allow the patient to recover from the adverse reaction and then restart at the same dose. In the case 
that the adverse reaction recurs, it is recommended to interrupt the treatment and then resume at the 
lower dose. If adverse reactions persist beyond a 28-day dose interruption, it is recommended that 
Zejula be discontinued. If adverse reactions are not manageable with this strategy of dose interruption 
and reduction, it is recommended that Zejula be discontinued.

Table 3: Dose modifications for haematologic adverse reactions 
Haematologic adverse reactions have been observed during the treatment with Zejula especially 
during the initial phase of the treatment. It is therefore recommended to monitor complete blood 
counts (CBCs) weekly during the first month of treatment and modify the dose as needed. After the 
first month, it is recommended to monitor CBCs monthly and periodically after this time (see 
section 4.4). Based on individual laboratory values, weekly monitoring for the second month may 
be warranted. 
• 
Haematologic adverse reaction 
requiring transfusion or 
haematopoietic growth factor 
support 
For patients with platelet count ≤ 10,000/μL, platelet 
transfusion should be considered. If there are other risk 
factors for bleeding such as co-administration of 
anticoagulation or antiplatelet medicinal products, 
consider interrupting these substances and/or 
transfusion at a higher platelet count. 
Resume Zejula at a reduced dose. 
• 
First occurrence: 
•  Withhold Zejula for a maximum of 28 days and monitor 
blood counts weekly until platelet counts return to 
≥ 100,000/µL. 
Resume Zejula at same or reduced dose per Table 1 
based on clinical evaluation. 
If platelet count is < 75,000/μL at any time, resume at a 
reduced dose per Table 1.  
• 
• 
Platelet count < 100,000/μL 
Neutrophil < 1,000/µL or 
Haemoglobin < 8 g/dL 
Second occurrence: 
•  Withhold Zejula for a maximum of 28 days and monitor 
blood counts weekly until platelet counts return 
to ≥ 100,000/µL. 
Resume Zejula at a reduced dose per Table 1. 
Discontinue Zejula if the platelet count has not returned 
to acceptable levels within 28 days of the dose 
interruption period, or if the patient has already 
undergone dose reduction to 100 mg QD. 
• 
• 
•  Withhold Zejula for a maximum of 28 days and monitor 
blood counts weekly until neutrophil counts return 
to ≥ 1,500/µL or haemoglobin returns to ≥ 9 g/dL. 
Resume Zejula at a reduced dose per Table 1. 
Discontinue Zejula if neutrophils and/or haemoglobin 
have not returned to acceptable levels within 28 days of 
the dose interruption period, or if the patient has already 
undergone dose reduction to 100 mg QD. 
• 
• 
Confirmed diagnosis of 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
or acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML) 
• 
Permanently discontinue Zejula. 
Patients with low body weight in recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance treatment 
Approximately 25% of patients in the NOVA study weighed less than 58 kg, and approximately 25% 
of patients weighed more than 77 kg. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (ADRs) was 
greater among low body weight patients (78%) than high body weight patients (53%). Only 13% of 
low body weight patients remained at a dose of 300 mg beyond Cycle 3. A starting dose of 200 mg for 
patients weighing less than 58 kg may be considered. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (≥ 65 years). There are limited clinical data in 
patients aged 75 or over. 
26 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. There are no 
data in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis; use 
with caution in these patients (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (either aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) > upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin (TB) ≤ ULN or any AST 
and TB > 1.0 x – 1,5 x ULN). For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (any AST and TB > 1.5 
x - 3 x ULN) the recommended starting dose of Zejula is 200 mg once daily. There are no data in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (any AST and TB > 3 x ULN); use with caution in these 
patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Patients with ECOG performance status 2 to 4 
Clinical data are not available in patients with ECOG performance status 2 to 4. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of niraparib in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Zejula is for oral use. 
It is advised to take Zejula tablets without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) or with 
a light meal (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haematologic adverse reactions 
Haematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia) have been reported in 
patients treated with Zejula (see section 4.8). Patients with lower body weight or lower baseline 
platelet count may be at increased risk of Grade 3+ thrombocytopenia (see section 4.2). 
Testing complete blood counts weekly for the first month, followed by monthly monitoring for the 
next 10 months of treatment and periodically after this time is recommended to monitor for clinically 
significant changes in any haematologic parameter during treatment (see section 4.2). 
If a patient develops severe persistent haematologic toxicity including pancytopenia that does not 
resolve within 28 days following interruption, Zejula should be discontinued. 
Due to the risk of thrombocytopenia, anticoagulants and medicinal products known to reduce the 
thrombocyte count should be used with caution (see section 4.8). 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia 
Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML), including cases with fatal 
outcome, have been observed in patients treated with Zejula monotherapy or combination therapy in 
clinical trials and postmarketing (see section 4.8). 
In clinical trials, the duration of Zejula treatment in patients prior to developing MDS/AML varied 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from 0.5 months to > 4.9 years. The cases were typical of secondary, cancer therapy-related 
MDS/AML. All patients had received platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens and many had also 
received other DNA damaging agents and radiotherapy. Some of the patients had a history of bone 
marrow suppression. In the NOVA trial, the incidence of MDS/AML was higher in the gBRCAmut 
cohort (7.4%) than in the non-gBRCAmut cohort (1.7%). 
For suspected MDS/AML or prolonged haematological toxicities, the patient should be referred to a 
haematologist for further evaluation. If MDS/AML is confirmed Zejula treatment should be 
discontinued and the patient treated appropriately. 
Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis 
Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported with the use of Zejula (see section 4.8). 
Pre-existing hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Zejula treatment. Blood 
pressure should be monitored at least weekly for two months, monitored monthly afterwards for the 
first year and periodically thereafter during treatment with Zejula. Home blood pressure monitoring 
may be considered for appropriate patients with instruction to contact their health care provider in case 
of rise in blood pressure. 
Hypertension should be medically managed with antihypertensive medicinal products as well as 
adjustment of the Zejula dose (see section 4.2), if necessary. In the clinical programme, blood pressure 
measurements were obtained on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle while the patient remained on Zejula. In 
most cases, hypertension was controlled adequately using standard antihypertensive treatment with or 
without Zejula dose adjustment (see section 4.2). Zejula should be discontinued in case of 
hypertensive crisis or if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately controlled with 
antihypertensive therapy. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
There have been reports of PRES in patients receiving Zejula (see section 4.8). PRES is a rare, 
reversible, neurological disorder which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including 
seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without 
associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
In case of PRES, it is recommended to discontinue Zejula and to treat specific symptoms including 
hypertension. The safety of reinitiating Zejula therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not 
known. 
Pregnancy/contraception 
Zejula should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not willing to use 
highly effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of Zejula 
(see section 4.6). A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing potential prior 
to treatment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment could have increased exposure of niraparib based on data 
from patients with moderate hepatic impairment and should be carefully monitored (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
Lactose 
Zejula film-coated tablets contain lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicine.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
The combination of niraparib with vaccines or immunosuppressant agents has not been studied. 
The data on niraparib in combination with cytotoxic medicinal products are limited. Therefore, caution 
should be taken if niraparib is used in combination with vaccines, immunosuppressant agents or with 
other cytotoxic medicinal products. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Effect of other medicinal products on niraparib 
Niraparib as a substrate of CYPs (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4)  
Niraparib is a substrate of carboxylesterases (CEs) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in vivo. 
Oxidative metabolism of niraparib is minimal in vivo. No dose adjustment for Zejula is required when 
administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit (e.g. itraconazole, ritonavir, and 
clarithromycin) or induce CYP enzymes (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin). 
Niraparib as a substrate of efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, and MATE1/2)  
Niraparib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
However, due to its high permeability and bioavailability, the risk of clinically relevant interactions 
with medicinal products that inhibit these transporters is unlikely. Therefore, no dose adjustment for 
Zejula is required when administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit P-gp 
(e.g. amiodarone, verapamil) or BCRP (e.g. osimertinib, velpatasvir, and eltrombopag). 
Niraparib is not a substrate of bile salt export pump (BSEP), or multidrug resistance-associated protein 
2 (MRP2). The major primary metabolite M1 is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, or MRP2. 
Niraparib is not a substrate of multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)-1 or 2, while M1 is a substrate 
of both. 
Niraparib as a substrate of hepatic uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1) 
Neither niraparib nor M1 is a substrate of organic anion transport polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), 1B3 
(OATP1B3), or organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1). No dose adjustment for Zejula is required when 
administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit OATP1B1 or 1B3 (e.g. 
gemfibrozil, ritonavir), or OCT1 (e.g. dolutegravir) uptake transporters. 
Niraparib as a substrate of renal uptake transporters (OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2)  
Neither niraparib nor M1 is a substrate of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), 3 (OAT3), and organic 
cation transporter 2 (OCT2). No dose adjustment for Zejula is required when administered 
concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit OAT1 (e.g. probenecid) or OAT3 (e.g. 
probenecid, diclofenac), or OCT2 uptake transporters (e.g. cimetidine, quinidine). 
Effect of niraparib on other medicinal products  
Inhibition of CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) 
Neither niraparib nor M1 is an inhibitor of any active substance-metabolising CYP enzymes, namely 
CYP1A1/2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. 
Even though inhibition of CYP3A4 in the liver is not expected, the potential to inhibit CYP3A4 at the 
intestinal level has not been established at relevant niraparib concentrations. Therefore, caution is 
recommended when niraparib is combined with active substances the metabolism of which is 
CYP3A4-dependent and, notably, those having a narrow therapeutic range (e.g. ciclosporin, 
tacrolimus, alfentanil, ergotamine, pimozide, quetiapine, and halofantrine). 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)  
Niraparib did not exhibit inhibitory effect against the UGT isoforms (UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A9, 
and UGT2B7) up to 200 µM in vitro. Therefore, the potential for a clinically relevant inhibition of 
UGTs by niraparib is minimal. 
Induction of CYPs (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4)  
Neither niraparib nor M1 is a CYP3A4 inducer in vitro. In vitro, niraparib weakly induces CYP1A2 at 
high concentrations and the clinical relevance of this effect could not be completely ruled out. M1 is 
not a CYP1A2 inducer. Therefore, caution is recommended when niraparib is combined with active 
substances the metabolism of which is CYP1A2-dependent and, notably, those having a narrow 
therapeutic range (e.g. clozapine, theophylline, and ropinirole). 
Inhibition of efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, and MATE1/2)  
Niraparib is not an inhibitor of BSEP or MRP2. In vitro, niraparib inhibits P-gp very weakly and 
BCRP with an IC50 = 161 µM and 5.8 µM, respectively. Therefore, a clinically meaningful interaction 
related to an inhibition of these efflux transporters, although unlikely, cannot be excluded. Caution is 
then recommended when niraparib is combined with substrates of BCRP (irinotecan, rosuvastatin, 
simvastatin, atorvastatin, and methotrexate). 
Niraparib is an inhibitor of MATE1 and -2 with IC50 of 0.18 µM and ≤ 0.14 µM, respectively. 
Increased plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates of these 
transporters (e.g. metformin) cannot be excluded. 
The major primary metabolite M1 does not appear to be an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2 or 
MATE1/2. 
Inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1)  
Neither niraparib nor M1 is an inhibitor of organic anion transport polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) or 
1B3 (OATP1B3). 
In vitro, niraparib weakly inhibits the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) with an IC50 = 34.4 µM. 
Caution is recommended when niraparib is combined with active substances that undergo an uptake 
transport by OCT1 such as metformin. 
Inhibition of renal uptake transporters (OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2)  
Neither niraparib nor M1 inhibits organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), 3 (OAT3), and organic cation 
transporter 2 (OCT2). 
All clinical studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while on treatment and should not be 
pregnant at the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of 
childbearing potential prior to treatment. Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective 
contraception during therapy and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of Zejula. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of niraparib in pregnant women. Animal 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted. However, based on its 
mechanism of action, niraparib could cause embryonic or foetal harm, including embryo-lethal and 
teratogenic effects, when administered to a pregnant woman. Zejula should not be used during 
pregnancy. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether niraparib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding is 
contraindicated during administration of Zejula and for 1 month after receiving the last dose (see 
section 4.3). 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on fertility. A reversible reduction of spermatogenesis was observed in rats 
and dogs (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Zejula has moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Patients who take Zejula may 
experience asthenia, fatigue, dizziness or difficulties concentrating. Patients who experience these 
symptoms should observe caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
ADRs of all grades occurring in ≥ 10% of the 851 patients receiving Zejula monotherapy in the pooled 
PRIMA (either 200 mg or 300 mg starting dose) and NOVA trials were nausea, anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, fatigue, constipation, vomiting, headache, insomnia, platelet count decreased, 
neutropenia, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, hypertension, asthenia, 
dizziness, neutrophil count decreased, cough, arthralgia, back pain, white blood cell count decreased, 
and hot flush. 
The most common serious adverse reactions > 1% (treatment-emergent frequencies) were 
thrombocytopenia and anaemia. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been identified based on clinical trials and post-marketing 
surveillance in patients receiving Zejula monotherapy (see Table 4). Frequencies of occurrence of 
undesirable effects are based on pooled adverse events data generated from the PRIMA and NOVA 
studies (fixed starting dose of 300 mg/day) where patient exposure is known and defined as: very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 
to < 1/1,000); and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The adverse reactions noted in the group of patients who were administered a 200 mg starting dose of 
Zejula based on baseline weight or platelet count were of similar or lesser frequency compared to the 
group administered a fixed starting dose of 300 mg (Table 4).  
See below for specific information regarding frequency of thrombocytopenia, anaemia and 
neutropenia. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Haematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia) including clinical 
diagnoses and/or laboratory findings generally occurred early during niraparib treatment with the 
incidence decreasing over time. 
In the NOVA and PRIMA studies, patients eligible for Zejula therapy had the following baseline 
haematologic parameters: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/µL; platelets ≥ 100,000 
cells/µL and haemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (NOVA) or ≥ 10 g/dL (PRIMA) prior to therapy. In the clinical 
programme, haematologic adverse reactions were managed with laboratory monitoring and dose 
modifications (see section 4.2). 
In PRIMA, patients who were administered a starting dose of Zejula based on baseline weight or 
platelet count, Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, anaemia and neutropenia were reduced from 48% to 21%, 
36% to 23% and 24% to 15%, respectively, compared to the group administered a fixed starting dose 
of 300 mg. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and neutropenia occurred, 
respectively, in 3%, 3%, and 2% of patients.  
Thrombocytopenia 
In PRIMA, 39% of Zejula-treated patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia compared to 
0.4% of placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 22 days (range: 15 
to 335 days) and with a median duration of 6 days (range: 1 to 374 days). Discontinuation due to 
thrombocytopenia occurred in 4% of patients receiving niraparib. 
In NOVA, approximately 60% of patients receiving Zejula experienced thrombocytopenia of any 
grade, and 34% of patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. In patients with baseline platelet 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
count less than 180 × 109/L, thrombocytopenia of any grade and Grade 3/4 occurred in 76% and 45% 
of the patients, respectively. The median time to onset of thrombocytopenia regardless of grade and 
Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 22 and 23 days, respectively. The rate of new incidences of 
thrombocytopenia after intensive dose modifications were performed during the first two months of 
treatment from Cycle 4 was 1.2%. The median duration of thrombocytopenia events of any grade was 
23 days, and the median duration of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 10 days. Patients treated with 
Zejula who develop thrombocytopenia might have an increased risk of haemorrhage. In the clinical 
programme, thrombocytopenia was managed with laboratory monitoring, dose modification and 
platelet transfusion where appropriate (see section 4.2). Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia 
events (thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) occurred in approximately 3% of the patients. 
In the NOVA study, 48 of 367 (13%) of patients experienced bleeding with concurrent 
thrombocytopenia; all bleeding events concurrent with thrombocytopenia were Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity except for one event of Grade 3 petechiae and haematoma observed concurrently with a 
serious adverse reaction of pancytopenia. Thrombocytopenia occurred more commonly in patients 
whose baseline platelet count was less than 180 × 109/L. Approximately 76% of patients with lower 
baseline platelets (< 180 × 109/L) who received Zejula experienced thrombocytopenia of any grade, 
and 45% of the patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Pancytopenia has been observed 
in < 1% of patients receiving niraparib.  
Anaemia 
In PRIMA, 31% of Zejula-treated patients experienced Grade 3/4 anaemia compared to 2% of 
placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 80 days (range: 15 to 533 
days) and with a median duration of 7 days (range: 1 to 119 days). Discontinuation due to anaemia 
occurred in 2% of patients receiving niraparib. 
In NOVA, approximately 50% of patients experienced anaemia of any grade, and 25% experienced 
Grade 3/4 anaemia. The median time to onset of anaemia of any grade was 42 days, and 85 days for 
Grade 3/4 events. The median duration of anaemia of any grade was 63 days, and 8 days for Grade 3/4 
events. Anaemia of any grade might persist during Zejula treatment. In the clinical programme, 
anaemia was managed with laboratory monitoring, dose modification (see section 4.2), and where 
appropriate with red blood cell transfusions. Discontinuation due to anaemia occurred in 1% of 
patients. 
Neutropenia 
In PRIMA, 21% of Zejula-treated patients experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia compared to 1% of 
placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 29 days (range: 15 to 421 
days) and with a median duration of 8 days (range: 1 to 42 days). Discontinuation due to neutropenia 
occurred in 2% of patients receiving niraparib. 
In NOVA, approximately 30% of patients receiving Zejula experienced neutropenia of any grade, and 
20% of patients experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia. The median time to onset of neutropenia of any 
grade was 27 days, and 29 days for Grade 3/4 events. The median duration of neutropenia of any grade 
was 26 days, and 13 days for Grade 3/4 events. In addition, Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor 
(G-CSF) was administered to approximately 6% of patients treated with niraparib as concomitant 
therapy for neutropenia. Discontinuation due to neutropenia events occurred in 2% of patients. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myeloid leukaemia 
In clinical studies, MDS/AML occurred in 1% patients treated with Zejula, with 41% of cases having a 
fatal outcome. The incidence was higher in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer who had received 2 
or more lines of prior platinum chemotherapy and with gBRCAmut following 75 months survival 
follow-up. All patients had potential contributing factors for the development of MDS/AML, having 
received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents. Many had also received other DNA damaging 
agents and radiotherapy. The majority of reports were in gBRCAmut carriers. Some of the patients had 
a history of previous cancer or of bone marrow suppression. 
In the PRIMA study, the incidence of MDS/AML was 0.8% in patients receiving Zejula and 0.4% in 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients received placebo. 
In the NOVA study in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer who had received at least two prior lines 
of platinum chemotherapy, the overall incidence of MDS/AML was 3.8% in patients receiving Zejula 
and 1.7% in patients receiving placebo at a follow-up of 75 months. In gBRCAmut and non-
gBRCAmut cohorts, the incidence of MDS/AML was 7.4% and 1.7% in patients receiving Zejula and 
3.1% and 0.9% in patients receiving placebo, respectively. 
Hypertension 
In PRIMA, Grade 3/4 hypertension occurred in 6% of Zejula-treated patients compared to 1% of 
placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 50 days (range: 1 to 589 
days) and with a median duration of 12 days (range: 1 to 61 days). Discontinuation due to 
hypertension occurred in 0% of patients. 
In NOVA, hypertension of any grade occurred in 19.3% of patients treated with Zejula. Grade 3/4 
hypertension occurred in 8.2% of patients. Hypertension was readily managed with anti-hypertensive 
medicinal products. Discontinuation due to hypertension occurred in < 1% of patients. 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted in paediatric patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific treatment in the event of Zejula overdose, and symptoms of overdose are not 
established. In the event of an overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and 
should treat symptomatically. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XK02. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Niraparib is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2, 
which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may 
involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes 
resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was 
observed in tumour cell lines with or without deficiencies in the Breast Cancer (BRCA) 1 and 2 tumour 
suppressor genes. In orthotopic high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient-derived xenograft tumours 
(PDX) grown in mice, niraparib has been shown to reduce tumour growth in BRCA 1 and 2 mutant, 
BRCA wild-type but homologous recombination (HR) deficient, and in tumours that are BRCA wild-
type and without detectable HR deficiency. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
First-line ovarian cancer maintenance treatment  
PRIMA was a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients (n = 733) in complete 
or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were randomised 2:1 to niraparib or 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
matched placebo. PRIMA was initiated with a starting dose of 300 mg QD in 475 patients (whereof 
317 was randomised to the niraparib arm vs 158 in the placebo arm) in continuous 28-day cycles. The 
starting dose in PRIMA was changed with Amendment 2 of the Protocol. From that point forward, 
patients with a baseline body weight ≥77 kg and baseline platelet count ≥150,000/µL were 
administered niraparib 300 mg (n = 34) or placebo daily (n = 21) while patients with a baseline body 
weight <77 kg or baseline platelet count <150,000/μL were administered niraparib 200 mg (n = 122) 
or placebo daily (n = 61). 
Patients were randomised post completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy plus/minus 
surgery. Subjects were randomised within 12 weeks of the first day of the last cycle of 
chemotherapy.Subjects had ≥6 and ≤9 cycles of platinum-based therapy. Following interval debulking 
surgery subjects had ≥2 post-operative cycles of platinum-based therapy. Patients who had received 
bevacizumab with chemotherapy but could not receive bevacizumab as maintenance therapy were not 
excluded from the study. Patients could not have received prior PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapy, 
including niraparib. Patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking 
surgery could have visible residual or no residual disease. Patients with Stage III disease who had 
complete cytoreduction (i.e., no visible residual disease) after primary debulking surgery were 
excluded. Randomisation was stratified by best response during the front-line platinum regimen 
(complete response vs partial response), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) (Yes vs No); and 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status [positive (HR deficient) vs negative (HR 
proficient) or not determined]. Testing for HRD was performed using the HRD test on tumour tissue 
obtained at the time of initial diagnosis. The CA-125 levels should be in the normal range (or a CA-
125 decrease by > 90%) during the patient’s front-line therapy, and be stable for at least 7 days.  
Patients began treatment on Cycle 1/Day 1 (C1/D1) with niraparib 200 or 300 mg or matched placebo 
administered QD in continuous 28-day cycles. Clinic visits occurred each cycle (4 weeks ± 3 days). 
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), as determined by blinded independent 
central review (BICR) per RECIST, version 1.1. Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary objective. 
PFS testing was performed hierarchically: first in the HR deficient population, then in the overall 
population. The median age of 62 ranged from 32 to 85 years among patients randomised with 
niraparib and 33 to 88 years among patients randomised with placebo. Eighty-nine percent of all 
patients were white. Sixty-nine percent of patients randomised with niraparib and 71% of patients 
randomised with placebo had an ECOG of 0 at study baseline. In the overall population, 65% of 
patients had stage III disease and 35% had stage IV disease. In the overall population, the primary 
tumour site in most patients (≥ 80%) was the ovary; most patients (> 90%) had tumours with serous 
histology. Sixty-seven percent of the patients received NACT. Sixty-nine percent of the patients had a 
complete response to the first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. A total of 6 niraparib patients had 
received bevacizumab as prior treatment for their ovarian cancer. 
PRIMA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomised to 
niraparib as compared with placebo in the HR deficient and overall population (Table 5, and Figures 1 
and 2). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS after the first subsequent therapy (PFS2) and OS 
(Table 5).

Subgroup analyses 
Within the HR deficient population, a hazard ratio of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.62) was observed in the 
subgroup of patients with BRCAmut ovarian cancer (N = 223). In the subgroup of HR deficient 
patients without a BRCA mutation (N = 150), a hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.83) was 
observed. In the HR proficient population (N = 249), a hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.94) was 
observed. 
In exploratory subgroup analyses of patients who were administered 200 or 300 mg dose of Zejula 
based on baseline weight or platelet count, comparable efficacy (investigator-assessed PFS) was 
observed with a hazard ratio of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.91) in the HR deficient population, and with a 
hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.94) in the overall population. In the HR proficient subgroup, the 
dose of 200 mg appeared to give a lower treatment effect compared to the 300 mg dose. 
Platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance treatment 
The safety and efficacy of niraparib as maintenance therapy was studied in a Phase 3 randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled international trial (NOVA) in patients with relapsed predominantly 
high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who were platinum 
sensitive, defined by complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for more than six months to 
their penultimate (next to last) platinum-based therapy. To be eligible for niraparib treatment, the 
patient should be in response (CR or PR) following completion of last platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The CA-125 levels should be normal (or a > 90% decrease in CA-125 from baseline) following their 
last platinum treatment, and be stable for at least 7 days. Patients could not have received prior PARPi 
therapy, including Zejula. Eligible patients were assigned to one of two cohorts based on the results of 
a germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutation test. Within each cohort, patients were randomised using a 2:1 
allocation of niraparib and placebo. Patients were assigned to the gBRCAmut cohort based on blood 
samples for gBRCA analysis that were taken prior to randomisation. Testing for tumour BRCA 
(tBRCA) mutation and HRD was performed using the HRD test on tumour tissue obtained at the time 
of initial diagnosis or at the time of recurrence. 
Randomisation within each cohort was stratified by time to progression after the penultimate platinum 
therapy before study enrolment (6 to < 12 months and ≥ 12 months); use or not of bevacizumab in

conjunction with the penultimate or last platinum regimen; and best response during the most recent 
platinum regimen (complete response and partial response). 
Patients began treatment on Cycle 1/Day 1 (C1/D1) with niraparib 300 mg or matched placebo 
administered QD in continuous 28-day cycles. Clinic visits occurred each cycle (4 weeks ± 3 days). 
In the NOVA study, 48% of patients had a dose interruption in Cycle 1. Approximately 47% of 
patients restarted at a reduced dose in Cycle 2. 
The most commonly used dose in niraparib-treated patients in the NOVA study was 200 mg. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was determined per RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors, version 1.1) or clinical signs and symptoms and increased CA-125. PFS was measured from 
the time of randomisation (which occurred up to 8 weeks after completion of the chemotherapy 
regimen) to disease progression or death. 
The primary efficacy analysis for PFS was determined by blinded central independent assessment and 
was prospectively defined and assessed for the gBRCAmut cohort and the non-gBRCAmut cohort 
separately. Overall survival (OS) analyses were secondary outcome measures. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included chemotherapy-free interval (CFI), time to first subsequent 
therapy (TFST), PFS after the first subsequent therapy (PFS2), and OS. 
Demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior treatment history were generally well 
balanced between the niraparib and placebo arms in the gBRCAmut (n = 203) and the non-gBRCAmut 
cohorts (n = 350). Median ages ranged from 57 to 63 years across treatments and cohorts. The primary 
tumour site in most patients (> 80%) within each cohort was the ovary; most patients (> 84%) had 
tumours with serous histology. A high proportion of patients in both treatment arms in both cohorts 
had received 3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy, including 49% and 34% of niraparib patients in 
the gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut cohorts, respectively. Most patients were age 18 to 64 years 
(78%), Caucasian (86%) and had an ECOG performance status of 0 (68%). 
In the gBRCAmut cohort, the median number of treatment cycles was higher in the niraparib arm than 
the placebo arm (14 and 7 cycles, respectively). More patients in the niraparib group continued 
treatment for more than 12 months than patients in the placebo group (54.4% and 16.9% respectively). 
In the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort, the median number of treatment cycles was higher in the 
niraparib arm than in the placebo arm (8 and 5 cycles, respectively). More patients in the niraparib 
group continued treatment for more than 12 months than patients in the placebo group (34.2% and 
21.1%, respectively). 
The study met its primary objective of statistically significantly improved PFS for niraparib 
maintenance monotherapy compared with placebo in the gBRCAmut cohort as well as in the overall 
non-gBRCAmut cohort. Table 6 and Figures 3 and 4 show the results for the PFS primary endpoint for 
the primary efficacy populations (gBRCAmut cohort and the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort).

Secondary efficacy endpoints in NOVA 
At the final analysis, the median PFS2 in the gBRCAmut cohort was 29.9 months for patients treated 
with niraparib compared to 22.7 months for patients on placebo (HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97). The 
median PFS2 in the non-gBRCAmut cohort was 19.5 months for patients treated with niraparib 
compared to 16.1 months for patients on placebo (HR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.02). 
At the final analysis of overall survival, the median OS in the gBRCAmut cohort (n = 203) was 40.9 
months for patients treated with niraparib compared with 38.1 months for patients on placebo 
(HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.20). The cohort maturity for the gBRCAmut cohort was 76%. The median

OS in the non-gBRCAmut cohort (n = 350) was 31.0 months for patients treated with niraparib 
compared with 34.8 months for patients on placebo (HR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.37). The cohort 
maturity for the non-gBRCAmut cohort was 79%. 
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from validated survey tools (FOSI and EQ-5D) indicate that 
niraparib-treated patients reported no difference from placebo in measures associated with quality of 
life (QoL). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Zejula 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in ovarian carcinoma (excluding rhabdomyosarcoma and 
germ cell tumours). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Following a single-dose administration of 300 mg niraparib under fasting conditions, niraparib was 
measurable in plasma within 30 minutes and the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for niraparib 
was reached in about 3 hours [804 ng/mL (% CV:50.2%)]. Following multiple oral doses of niraparib 
from 30 mg to 400 mg once daily, accumulation of niraparib was approximately 2 to 3 folds. 
The systemic exposures (Cmax and AUC) to niraparib increased in a dose-proportional manner when 
the dose of niraparib increased from 30 mg to 400 mg. The absolute bioavailability of niraparib is 
approximately 73%, indicating minimal first pass effect. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
niraparib, the inter-individual variability in bioavailability was estimated to a coefficient of variation 
(CV) of 31%. 
Following a high-fat meal in patients with solid tumours, the Cmax and AUCinf of niraparib tablets 
increased by 11% and 28%, respectively, as compared with fasting conditions (see section 4.2). 
The tablet and capsule formulations have been demonstrated to be bioequivalent. Following 
administration of either one 300 mg tablet or three 100 mg capsules of niraparib in 108 patients with 
solid tumours under fasting conditions, the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios for 
tablet compared to capsules for Cmax, AUClast and AUC∞ fell within the limits of bioequivalence (0.80 
and 1.25). 
Distribution 
Niraparib was moderately protein bound in human plasma (83%), mainly with serum albumin. In a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of niraparib, the apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 
1,311 L (based on a 70 kg patient) in cancer patients (CV 116%), indicating extensive tissue 
distribution of niraparib. 
Biotransformation 
Niraparib is metabolised primarily by carboxylesterases (CEs) to form a major inactive metabolite, 
M1. In a mass balance study, M1 and M10 (the subsequently formed M1 glucuronides) were the major 
circulating metabolites. 
Elimination 
Following a single oral 300-mg dose of niraparib, the mean terminal half-life (t½) of niraparib ranged 
from 48 to 51 hours (approximately 2 days). In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent 
total clearance (CL/F) of niraparib was 16.5 L/h in cancer patients (CV 23.4%). 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Niraparib is eliminated primarily through the hepatobiliary and renal routes. Following an oral 
administration of a single 300-mg dose of [14C]-niraparib, on average 86.2% (range 71% to 91%) of 
the dose was recovered in urine and faeces over 21 days. Radioactive recovery in the urine accounted 
for 47.5% (range 33.4% to 60.2%) and in the faeces for 38.8% (range 28.3% to 47%) of the dose. In 
pooled samples collected over 6 days, 40% of the dose was recovered in the urine primarily as 
metabolites and 31.6% of the dose was recovered in the faeces primarily as unchanged niraparib. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, patients with mild (creatinine clearance 60-90 mL/min) 
and moderate (30-60 mL/min) renal impairment had mildly reduced niraparib clearance compared to 
individuals with normal renal function (7-17% higher exposure in mild and 17-38% higher exposure in 
moderate renal impairment). The difference in exposure is not considered to warrant dose adjustment. 
No patients with pre-existing severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease undergoing 
hemodialysis were identified in clinical studies (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from clinical studies in patients, pre-existing mild 
hepatic impairment (n = 155) did not influence the clearance of niraparib. In a clinical study of cancer 
patients using NCI-ODWG criteria to classify the degree of hepatic impairment, niraparib AUCinf in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n = 8) was 1.56 (90% CI: 1.06, 2.30) times the niraparib 
AUCinf in patients with normal hepatic function (n = 9) following administration of a single 300 mg 
dose. Niraparib dose adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2). Moderate hepatic impairment did not have an effect on niraparib Cmax or on niraparib 
protein binding. The pharmacokinetics of niraparib have not been assessed in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Weight, age and race 
Increasing weight was found to increase niraparib volume of distribution in the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. No impact of weight was identified on niraparib clearance or overall 
exposure. Dose adjustment according to body weight is not warranted from a pharmacokinetic point of 
view. 
Increasing age was found to decrease niraparib clearance in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
The average exposure in a 91-year old patient was predicted to be 23% higher than in a 30-year old 
patient. The impact of age is not considered to warrant dose adjustment. 
There is insufficient data across races to conclude on the impact of race on niraparib 
pharmacokinetics. 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of niraparib in paediatric patients. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data  
Safety pharmacology 
In vitro, niraparib inhibited the dopamine transporter DAT at concentration levels below human 
exposure levels. In mice, single doses of niraparib increased intracellular levels of dopamine and 
metabolites in cortex. Reduced locomotor activity was seen in one of two single dose studies in mice. 
The clinical relevance of these findings is not known. No effect on behavioural and/or neurological 
parameters have been observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs at estimated CNS 
exposure levels similar to or below expected therapeutic exposure levels. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Decreased spermatogenesis was observed in rats and dogs at exposure levels below those seen 
clinically and was largely reversible within 4 weeks of cessation of dosing. 
Genotoxicity 
Niraparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) test but was clastogenic in 
an in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration assay and in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus 
assay. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary 
pharmacology of niraparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in humans. 
Reproductive toxicology 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with niraparib. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with niraparib.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Zejula is and what it is used for 
What Zejula is and how it works 
Zejula contains the active substance niraparib. Niraparib is a type of anti-cancer medicine called a 
PARP inhibitor. PARP inhibitors block an enzyme called poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] 
polymerase (PARP). PARP helps cells repair damaged DNA so blocking it means that the DNA of 
cancer cells cannot be repaired. This results in tumour cell death, helping to control the cancer. 
What Zejula is used for 
Zejula is used in adult women for the treatment of cancer of the ovary, the fallopian tubes (part of the 
female reproductive system that connects the ovaries to the uterus), or the peritoneum (the membrane 
lining the abdomen). 
Zejula is used for cancer that has: 
• 
• 
responded to the first treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, or 
come back (recurred) after the cancer has responded to previous treatment with standard 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Zejula 
Do not take Zejula  
• 
if you are allergic to niraparib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are breast-feeding. 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before or while taking this medicine if any of the following 
could apply to you: 
Low blood-cell counts 
Zejula lowers your blood-cell counts, such as your red blood-cell count (anaemia), white blood-cell 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
count (neutropenia), or blood-platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Signs and symptoms you need to 
look out for include fever or infection, and abnormal bruising or bleeding (see section 4 for more 
information). Your doctor will test your blood regularly throughout your treatment. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia 
Rarely, low blood-cell counts may be a sign of more serious problems with the bone marrow such as 
‘myelodysplastic syndrome’ (MDS) or ‘acute myeloid leukaemia’ (AML). Your doctor may want to 
test your bone marrow to check for these problems. 
High blood pressure 
Zejula can cause high blood pressure, which in some cases, could be severe. Your doctor will measure 
your blood pressure regularly throughout your treatment. He or she may also give you medicine to 
treat high blood pressure and adjust your Zejula dose, if necessary. Your doctor may advise home 
blood pressure monitoring and instruction on when to contact him or her in case of a rise in blood 
pressure. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
A rare neurological side effect named PRES has been associated with Zejula treatment. If you have 
headache, vision changes, confusion or seizure with or without high blood pressure, please contact 
your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
Children under 18 years of age should not be given Zejula. This medicine has not been studied in this 
age group. 
Other medicines and Zejula 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy  
Zejula should not be taken during pregnancy as it could harm your baby. If you are pregnant, think 
you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this 
medicine. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant you must use highly effective contraception while 
you are taking Zejula, and you must continue to use highly effective contraception for 6 months after 
taking your last dose. Your doctor will ask you to confirm that you are not pregnant with a pregnancy 
test before starting your treatment. Contact your doctor straightaway if you become pregnant while 
you are taking Zejula. 
Breast-feeding 
Zejula should not be taken if you are breast-feeding as it is not known if it passes into breast milk. If 
you are breast-feeding, you must stop before you start taking Zejula and you must not begin 
breast-feeding again until 1 month after taking your last dose. Ask your doctor for advice before 
taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines  
When you are taking Zejula it may make you feel weak, unfocused, tired or dizzy and therefore 
influence your ability to drive and use machines. Observe caution when driving or using machines.

3. 
How to take Zejula 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
For ovarian cancer that has responded to the first treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy 
The recommended starting dose is 200 mg (two 100 mg capsules), taken together once a day, with or 
without food. If you weigh ≥ 77 kg and have platelet count ≥ 150,000/μL before starting treatment, the 
recommended starting dose is 300 mg (three 100 mg capsules), taken together once a day, with or 
without food. 
For ovarian cancer that has come back (recurred) 
The recommended starting dose is 300 mg (three 100 mg capsules), taken together once a day, with or 
without food.

manage nausea. 
Your doctor may adjust your starting dose if you have problems with your liver. 
Swallow the capsules whole, with some water. Do not chew or crush the capsules. This will ensure the 
medicine works as well as possible. 
Your doctor may recommend a lower dose if you experience side effects (such as nausea, tiredness, 
abnormal bleeding/bruising, anaemia). 
Your doctor will check you on a regular basis, and you will normally continue to take Zejula as long 
as you experience benefit, and do not suffer unacceptable side effects. 
If you take more Zejula than you should  
If you take more than your normal dose, contact your doctor immediately.  
If you forget to take Zejula  
Do not take an additional dose if you miss a dose or vomit after taking Zejula. Take your next dose at 
its scheduled time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

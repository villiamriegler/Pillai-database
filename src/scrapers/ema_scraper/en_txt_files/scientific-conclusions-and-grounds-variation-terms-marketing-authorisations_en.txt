Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tezepelumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on risk of ‘hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction)’ from received 
reports including 30 cases with reported discontinuation of tezepelumab after observed 
hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions, 19 cases (out of 30) with stated improvement or recovery of the 
reaction, 9 cases (out of 30) with a close temporal relationship (within minutes/hour or in the same day), 
the PRAC considers a causal relationship between tezepelumab and ‘hypersensitivity (including 
anaphylactic reaction)’ is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product 
information of products containing tezepelumab should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tezepelumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tezepelumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Brief description of the 
product 
Zynlonta® 
Centralised 
Chemical class: 
Loncastuximab tesirine is a CD19-directed antibody conjugated to an 
alkylating agent. 
Summary of mode of action: 
Loncastuximab tesirine is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). 
Loncastuximab tesirine is composed of a humanised monoclonal 
antibody (RB4v1.2) to which the cytotoxin SG3199 has been 
conjugated through a cathepsin-cleavable linker. The toxin SG3199 
attached to the linker is designated as SG3249, also known as 
tesirine. Once bound to CD19, loncastuximab tesirine is internalised 
and the cathepsin-cleavable linker is cleaved, releasing free 
pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers (SG3199) inside the target cell. 
The PBD dimers are highly efficient anticancer drugs that covalently 
bind in the minor groove of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and form 
highly cytotoxic DNA interstrand cross-links. The cross-links formed 
by the PBD dimers are relatively non-distorting of the DNA 
structure, making them hidden to DNA repair mechanisms. 
Important information about its composition: 
Loncastuximab tesirine is composed of the following three 
components: 
•  RB4v1.2: a humanised immunoglobulin G (IgG)1, kappa 
monoclonal antibody, specific for human CD19, generated 
by the variable domain resurfacing of the murine monoclonal 
anti-B4 (anti-CD19) antibody. 
•  SG3199: a PBD dimer cytotoxin 
•  A cathepsin-cleavable linker, including maleimide, 8-
polyethylene glycol, a valine-alanine linker and a para-
aminobenzyl alcohol (PABA) self-immolative group, which 
links SG3199 to the humanised monoclonal antibody. 
The drug product has an average of two SG3249 molecules 
covalently bound to the antibody and is supplied as a sterile, white to

Indication 
Zynlonta as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), 
after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
Incidence and prevalence 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was the thirteenth most common cancer of 36 types of cancer 
reviewed worldwide, with 544,352 incident cases (2.8% of a total 19.3 million new cancer cases) 
in 2020 (Sung 2021). In the 27 European Union member states (EU-27) in 2020, NHL was the 
tenth most common cancer of 34 types of cancer, with 86,321 incident cases (3.2% of 2.7 million 
new cancer cases) (European Cancer Information System [ECIS, 2021]). The Global Cancer 
Observatory (https://gco.iarc.fr/today/home; accessed 15 March 2021) estimates world incidence 
of NHL as 5.8/100,000 (age-standardised to standard world population) and 7.0/100,000 (crude 
incidence). By comparison, the EU-27 incidence for 2020 is substantially higher and estimated at 
9.4/100,000 (age-standardised to world standard population), 18.3/100,000 (age-standardised to 
new European standard population), and 19.4/100,000 (crude incidence) (ECIS, 2021).  
DLBCL is the most common subtype of NHL, accounting for approximately 25% to 45% of 
NHL cases worldwide (Wild 2020). In the EU-27, DLBCL is estimated to represent a third of 
NHL cases, based on data from selected European registries over the period 2000 to 2019 (data 
submitted by Applicant for Orphan Medicinal Product Designation, June 2021). Based on these 
data, and as summarised below (Table 2), the DLBCL crude incidence rate in the EU-27/EEA is 
estimated to be 0.64 per 10,000, resulting in a prevalence of 4.3 per 10,000, below the threshold 
for orphan designation. Loncastuximab tesirine was granted orphan designation for the treatment 
of DLBCL on 20 August 2021 (EU/3/21/2481).

B: NHL incident cases for EU-27, Norway, Iceland from ECIS database (ECIS, 2021); estimate identical to that from Globocan 
database (https://gco.iarc.fr) 
C: DLBCL incidence was estimated using a DLBCL/NHL proportion of 33% (as submitted to and accepted by COMP for EU 
orphan designation for loncastuximab tesirine [EU/3/21/2481]) 
P: DLBCL prevalence was estimated using formula: Prevalence (P) = Incidence (I) x disease duration (D), where median disease 
duration (D) was estimated to be 6.78 years, using a 5-year survival of 60%, and assuming a constant hazard rate over the course 
of survival (as submitted to and accepted by COMP for EU orphan designation for loncastuximab tesirine [EU/3/21/2481]) 
*Estimated using incident rate of NHL for EU-27+NO+IS (19.3/100,000)  
The incidence of DLBCL varies regionally within Europe. The age-standardised incidence rate of 
DLBCL was reported to be significantly lower in Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Poland, 
Slovakia) at 1.79/100,000 and Northern Europe (Iceland, Norway, Sweden) at 0.79/100,000, with 
no remarkable differences between other European regions of UK/Ireland (3.67/100,000), Central 
Europe (4.68/100,000), and Southern Europe (4.15/100,000). Incidence increased with advancing 
age (Sant 2010). 
Demographics of the population with the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease 
DLBCL can occur at any age, but typically affects older individuals (median age at presentation 
is >65 years) and is slightly more frequent in males (Mounier 2015). 
Although the aetiology of DLBCL is not well understood, a number of factors, including 
immunosuppression, infections and autoimmune disease, have been associated with a higher risk 
of DLBCL (Lodhi 2020, Swerdlow 2016, 2017; Tilly 2015, Chihara 2015, Morton 2014; Clarke 
2013; Cerhan 2014):  
•  Chronic infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV], human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) 
and autoimmune diseases, particularly B-cell activating diseases (e.g., Sjögren syndrome).   
•  Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV), in the setting of immunodeficiency, is strongly associated with 
specific lymphoma entities such as lymphomatoid granulomatosis, DLBCL associated 
with chronic inflammation, EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer, or primary effusion 
lymphoma. However, EBV has also been implicated in DLBCL patients with no

documented predisposing immunodeficiency (categorised as EBV-positive DLBCL, NOS 
when excluding specific disease entities) (Swerdlow 2017).  
•  Solid organ transplantation, possibly as a result of chronic immune activation in response 
to the donor organ, immunosuppression therapy, or both, resulting in chronic immune 
dysfunction.  
•  Family history of NHL. 
•  Exposure to certain chemicals (pesticides, hair dyes). An increased risk of lymphoid 
malignancies has been documented in farmers exposed to pesticides, in workers in 
industries using formaldehyde, and in those exposed to dioxins, where most workers in 
these sectors are male (Sant 2010), with employment as seamstress/embroiderer or 
hairdresser associated with higher risk for females (Chihara 2015). 
The main existing treatment options 
Treatment recommendations for DLBCL are provided in the European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) guidelines (Tilly 2015). The following recommendations are made for 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL: 
• 
In patients aged <65–70 years with good performance status and no major organ 
dysfunction, salvage regimens with rituximab and chemotherapy followed, in responsive 
patients, by high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT), are recommended. 
•  Salvage regimens such as R-DHAP (rituximab, cisplatin, cytarabine, dexamethasone) or 
R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) appear to have similar outcomes. 
R-GDP (rituximab, cisplatin, gemcitabine, dexamethasone) is also recommended as it has 
been shown to have similar efficacy but less toxicity than R-DHAP. BEAM (carmustine, 
etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan) is the most commonly used high-dose regimen. 
•  Maintenance with rituximab is not recommended. 
•  Allogeneic transplantation with a sibling or matched unrelated donor may be considered 
in patients with refractory disease, early relapse or relapse after ASCT. 
•  Patients not suitable for high-dose therapy may be treated with the same or other salvage 
regimens as R-GemOx (rituximab - gemcitabine/oxaliplatin). Pixantrone is discussed as 
an option in heavily treated patients, however the recommendation is to preferably enrol 
these patients in clinical trials testing the activity of other novel drugs. 
The current ESMO guidelines do not reflect the introduction of newer treatments such as 
chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs, e.g., 
Polivy).  Certain anti-neoplastic agents are authorised (either centrally or nationally in several EU 
countries under different trade names) for the treatment of the broader condition of NHL, while 
others are authorised for non-NHL oncological indications. 
Medicinal products authorised centrally in the EU for the treatment of DLBCL or B-cell NHL 
(see Table 3) are: 
•  Rituximab (several brands) is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive 
DLBCL in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
prednisolone) chemotherapy. Although not specifically authorised for relapsed/refractory

In previously untreated DLBCL, the combination of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody 
rituximab and CHOP chemotherapy (R-CHOP) remains the backbone of therapy, with the total 
number of cycles, and addition of radiation, dependent on stage at presentation and tumour bulk. 
This approach can achieve durable remissions in approximately 60% of patients. For those who 
develop disease that is refractory to up-front treatment, or who relapse after achieving remission, 
outcomes are particularly poor, with HDC and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) achieving 
long term remissions in only a minority of patients in the era of rituximab (Liu 2019). 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma histologically characterised by 
dense proliferation of neoplastic medium or large B lymphoid cells with a nuclear size equal to or 
exceeding normal macrophage nuclei, or more than twice the size of a large lymphocyte 
(Swerdlow 2017). DLBCL can arise de novo (primary DLBCL) or transform from an existent, 
less aggressive lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma or small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(secondary DLBCL) (Lodhi 2020). 
DLBCL is considered the most common subtype of NHL. Patients usually present with a rapidly 
enlarging tumour mass at single or multiple nodal or extranodal sites. The majority of cases occur 
in the lymph nodes; approximately 40% of patients have extranodal involvement. The most 
common site of extranodal involvement is the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, ileocecal region), 
but DLBCL may occur in any organ/tissue including the bone, testes, spleen, skin, central 
nervous system (CNS), Waldeyer’s ring, salivary gland, thyroid, liver, kidneys and adrenal 
glands. DLBCL involving the kidneys and adrenal glands is associated with an increased risk of 
spread to the CNS (Swerdlow 2017; Beham-Schmid 2017).  
Many patients are asymptomatic, but symptoms may occur when tissues or organs are infiltrated. 
Pain in an enlarged lymph node or organ may be noted if the lymphomatous mass enlarges 
rapidly, and can be associated with B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss). Other 
symptoms include pruritus, anorexia, fatigue, pedal oedema (caused by pelvic lymphadenopathy), 
chest discomfort (caused by mediastinal lymphadenopathy). Additional complications include 
end-organ damage from disease involvement and myelosuppression leading to infections, 
anaemia, and thrombocytopenia (Swerdlow 2017).  
Since 1993, clinicians have used the International Prognostic Index (IPI) to characterise 
prognosis in aggressive NHL based on five clinical factors: age, stage, the number of extranodal

sites, performance status, and (LDH) lactate dehydrogenase (Liu 2019; Zhou 2014). However, the 
addition of rituximab to conventional CHOP or CHOP-like regimens for DLBCL has resulted in 
a major improvement in survival across all risk groups and, as a result, the capacity of the IPI to 
discriminate between risk groups has declined.  
DLBCL can be divided into two histologically indistinguishable molecular subtypes using gene-
expression profiling (GEP): germinal center B-cell-like (GCB-DLBCL; ~60%) and non-GCB-
like; most of the latter have an activated B-cell-like phenotype (ABC-DLBCL; ~40%) 
(Lodhi 2020; Swerdlow 2016; Alizadeh 2000).The non-GCB group has a more aggressive 
clinical course than GCB, and is associated with substantially worse outcomes when treated with 
R-CHOP (Lodhi 2020). The World Health Organisation (WHO) 2016 classification separates 
‘double-hit’ and ‘triple-hit’ lymphomas into a new category ‘high-grade B-cell lymphomas with 
MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements’, representing 1-12% of DLBCL tumours that are 
also associated with poorer outcomes (Wild 2020; Liu 2019; Swerdlow 2016). 
Survival of European DLBCL patients has been improving as a result of better disease 
management, although regional and age-dependent variations persist (Sant 2014; Mounier 2015; 
Monnereau 2016). The age-standardised 5-year relative survival for DLBCL patients from 
30 European cancer registries (EUROCARE-5; 54,361 cases) increased from 42% for those 
under observation in 1997-1999 (and diagnosed in the preceding years) to 55.4% a decade later 
(observation period: 2006-2008) (Sant 2014). These estimates were also consistent when using 
modified methodology for a selected EUROCARE-5 dataset from 43 registries, revealing an 
increase in 5-year net survival ranging from 40%-47% (period of diagnosis: 1996-1998) to 46%-
58% (period of diagnosis: 2002-2004) for 25,320 DLBCL patients with a median follow-up of 
7 years (Mounier 2015). Similarly, survival data of DLBCL patients (diagnosed during 2000-
2007) collected in 94 European registries (RARECARENet) was 52.6% at 5 years (Botta 2020). 
A recent study in metropolitan France for DLBCL patients diagnosed during 2005-2010 
(22 registries), presented a 5-year survival rate of 60% (Cowppli-Bony 2019). This is also in line 
with the most recent Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) survival data for 
DLBCL, NOS (relative 5-year survival of 59.8%; www.hmrn.org [last accessed 23 Aug 2021]). 
For the orphan designation of loncastuximab tesirine (EU/3/21/2481), the median survival was 
estimated to be 6.78 years, using a 5-year survival of 60%, and assuming a constant hazard rate 
over the course of survival. 
Important co-morbidities 
DLBCL is mainly a disease of older individuals with the median age at diagnosis between 60 and 
70 years and 30% of patients being older than 75 years of age (Sehn 2021). Hence many 
comorbidities reflect co-existent disease in this older age group. Comorbidities represent 
competing adverse risk factors and may influence treatment decision-making in patients since 
they can preclude the use of certain drugs or may require a dose reduction (Kocher 2020). The 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was originally developed to elaborate the prognostic 
significance of comorbidities irrespectively of the underlying disease (Charlson 1987). This score 
has also been used to estimate the comorbidity burden in cancer patients, including DLBCL 
(Wieringa 2014; Morrison 2020).

67% completed treatment with 46% CR. In patients with a CCI <2, overall survival (OS) after 1, 
2 and 5 years was 84%, 79% and 65%, respectively, and it was 64%, 48% and 48% for those with 
CCI ≥2. Comorbidity was demonstrated to be an independent risk indicator for worse OS in 
patients with advanced DLBCL treated with R

Another study in 181 Austrian patients evaluated the clinical impact of comorbidities at diagnosis 
(median age 60 years) (Kocher 2020). Although the majority (76.8%) of patients (n=139) did not 
reveal any comorbidities, 9.9% had a CCI ≥2 with the most prevalent comorbid conditions being 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes without complications and a second coincidental 
non-metastatic tumour. Advanced age was significantly associated with an increased burden of 
comorbidities. The complete remission rate was 77.3% in patients with CCI <2, whereas the CR 
rate was 50.0% in patients with CCI ≥2 (p=0.020). Comorbidity burden represented an adverse 
prognostic factor. Patients with a CCI score of 0–1 had a 3-year OS rate of 81.3%, whereas this 
percentage was significantly lower in patients with CCI ≥2: 38.9% (p<0.001). CCI ≥2 was 
associated with a 3.6-fold (95% CI 1.7–7.4) increased risk for death (Kocher 2020).  
The Swedish Lymphoma Register was used to identify 3,905 adult patients diagnosed with 
DLBCL, 2007-2013, and comorbid disease history was assessed according to the CCI. Overall, 
45% of the patients (n=1,737) had a history of at least one comorbidity at DLBCL diagnosis 
(cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and solid cancer were most frequent), and 997 (26%) had a CCI 
score of ≥2. Comorbidity was shown to be associated with inferior DLBCL outcome, mainly due 
to a lower likelihood of receiving treatment with curative intent (Wasterlid 2019).

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Part II:  Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
Loncastuximab tesirine (also referred to as ADCT-402) is an ADC composed of the humanised 
monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody RB4v1.2, directed against human CD19, to 
which SG3199, a PBD dimer cytotoxic agent, has been conjugated via a protease cleavable 
valine-alanine linker. The SG3199 cytotoxic agent attached to the linker is designated SG3249 
(also known as tesirine). 
PBDs are a class of naturally occurring anti-tumour antibiotics found in Streptomyces spp. PBD 
monomers bind in the DNA minor groove and form a single covalent aminal linkage to the 
exocyclic N2 amino group of guanines within purine-guanine-purine sequences. PBD dimers, 
obtained by joining two PBD monomers together via an appropriate polymethylene tether, have 
the ability to produce two covalent bonds forming highly cytotoxic DNA interstrand cross-links 
(Hartley 2011). The cross-links formed by PBD dimers are relatively non-distorting of the DNA 
structure, making them hidden to repair mechanisms (Adair 2012).  
In a human tissue cross reactivity study, ADCT-402 selectively bound to tissues known to 
contain CD19-expressing cells, and no evidence of off-target binding was observed. 
The nonclinical toxicity of ADCT-402 was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. ADCT-402 is not 
cross-reactive with cynomolgus monkey CD19, or CD19 from any other nonclinical species. 
Nevertheless, the cynomolgus monkey was selected for nonclinical safety assessment of 
ADCT-402 considering the general suitability of this species for nonclinical safety evaluation of 
ADCs, and the fact that the potential human pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and the toxicities 
associated with the PBD cytotoxic agent of ADCT-402 are adequately predicted in this species to 
allow for prediction of safe clinical starting doses. Potential on-target toxicity could not be 
evaluated in this species, however, there is extensive nonclinical and clinical experience with 
selective CD19 and CD20 depletion with ADCs and monoclonal antibodies that alleviates 
potential on-target toxicity concerns (Kimby 2005; Blanc 2011; Chen 2012; Hammer 2012; 
Marshall 2017). 
The nonclinical toxicity of the cytotoxic agent SG3199 was evaluated primarily in the rat, with a 
dose-range finding (DRF) study in the dog. In addition, in vitro toxicity evaluations were 
conducted with SG3199 to assess genotoxicity and photoreactivity. 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage are presented in 
Table 4.

Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage 
Key safety findings (from non- clinical studies) 
Relevance to human usage 
The toxicity profile of ADCT-402 was 
characterised by dose-dependent skin 
changes (epidermal hyperpigmentation with 
hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis), anaemia 
associated with bone marrow 
hypocellularity, nephropathy and testicular 
atrophy with reduced spermatogenesis. 
These effects were generally found or 
considered to be reversible.  
The toxicity profile of SG3199 in both rats 
and dogs was characterised by dose-
dependent myelosuppression, increased 
liver enzymes/liver toxicity, inflammation 
of the gastrointestinal tract, reduced body 
weight and poor clinical condition.  
The above observed effects in nonclinical 
studies with ADCT-402 and SG3199 are 
consistent with the safety profile of 
loncastuximab tesirine in clinical studies 
within the loncastuximab tesirine 
monotherapy (0.15 mg/kg) DLBCL 
population (n=215; 145 patients from 
pivotal study ADCT-402-201 and 
70 DLBCL patients from study ADCT-
402-101).  
Based on the results from animal studies, 
Zynlonta may impair human male fertility. 
The exposure multiple at the HNSTD in the 
pivotal GLP 13-week toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys over the 
recommended human dose of 0.15 mg/kg 
was approximately 3.2- or 3.5-fold based on 
Cmax or AUC, respectively. 
Toxicity 
Acute or repeat-dose toxicity studies 
Loncastuximab tesirine (ADCT-402) 
In Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant repeat-dose 
toxicity studies of up to 3 months duration in cynomolgus 
monkeys, the toxicities observed upon IV administration 
included dose-dependent skin changes (epidermal 
hyperpigmentation with hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis), 
anaemia associated with bone marrow hypocellularity, 
nephropathy and testicular atrophy with reduced 
spermatogenesis. The toxicities observed were largely 
consistent with toxicity mediated by the SG3199 cytotoxic 
agent. 
In the pivotal GLP 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study, the 
observed minimal-to-moderate skin discoloration showed 
evidence of a trend towards reversibility, with reduced 
incidence and/or severity following a 12-week treatment-
free phase, and these findings would be expected to reverse 
over time and were not considered adverse. 
The severe depletion/degeneration of germ cells that was 
observed in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys in the 
pivotal study was considered adverse. Although an 
assessment of sperm production was not included in the 
study, given the severity of the changes (severe atrophy of 
the seminiferous tubules, reduced height of germinal 
epithelium, disorganised spermatogenesis, germ cell 
degeneration, tubules with Sertoli cells only, and reduced 
weight, sperm and lumen of the epididymis) it seems 
highly likely that sperm production, and therefore organ 
function, would be adversely affected. In the pivotal 13- 
week toxicity study these findings had not reversed by the 
end of the 12-week recovery period. 
Minimal-to-marked nephropathy, characterised by 
localised degeneration and hyperplasia/hypertrophy of 
distal tubules and collecting ducts, mainly in the 
corticomedullary junction, was noted at all dose levels in 
the pivotal 13-week toxicity study. These findings were not 
associated with glomerulopathy and showed some evidence 
of reduced severity by the end of the 12-week recovery 
phase. These changes were associated with evidence of 
fibrosis and modest increases in serum creatinine at 
0.3 mg/kg high dose only, without evidence of any effects 
on urinalysis parameters. These findings were considered 
adverse, but with exception of the observed fibrosis would 
be expected to reverse without measurable impact on 
kidney function. 
Based on the totality of the findings, the 0.6 mg/kg dose 
was considered to represent a Highest Non-Severely Toxic 
Dose (HNSTD) in the GLP 4-week study, whilst the 0.3

mg/kg dose was considered to represent an HNSTD in the 
pivotal GLP 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study. In both 
cases this was the highest dose level tested (2.4 Nonclinical 
Overview). 
SG3199 
The toxicity profile of SG3199 upon daily dosing was 
evaluated primarily in Sprague-Dawley rats, with a dose-
range finding (DRF) study in Beagle dogs. In both rats and 
dogs, the toxicity profile of SG3199 was characterised by 
dose-dependent myelosuppression associated with bone 
marrow hypocellularity, increases in liver enzymes and 
bilirubin, associated with centrilobular hypertrophy, 
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract associated with 
epithelial degeneration in the duodenum, ileum and 
jejunum, and reductions in body weight. These findings 
were largely consistent with those of a cytotoxic agent such 
as SG3199. In the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study 
in the rat, the NOAEL for SG3199 was the 0.1 µg/kg/day 
dose. In the DRF study in the dog (Study 525532), the 
MTD for SG3199 was 0.3 µg/kg/day, given as a 3-day 
cycle (2.4 Nonclinical Overview). 
Reproductive/developmental toxicity 
Based on the outcome of the genotoxicity studies (see 
below), and in line with ICH S9 guidance, no 
reproductive/developmental toxicity studies were 
conducted.

Relevance to human usage 
Zynlonta contains a genotoxic component, 
SG3199 (see Genotoxicity).  
In the clinical development programme, 
women who were pregnant or breastfeeding 
were excluded from participation because 
of the potential harm that loncastuximab 
tesirine could have on the foetus (Module 
SIV.1). There was no loncastuximab 
tesirine exposure during pregnancy in the 
clinical setting (Module SIV.3). 
However, based on its mechanism of action, 
Zynlonta can cause embryo-foetal toxicity 
and/or teratogenicity when administered to 
a pregnant woman. Women of reproductive 
potential and pregnant women must be 
advised of the potential risk to a foetus. 
Women of reproductive potential should 
use effective contraception during treatment 
with Zynlonta and for 10 months after the 
last dose. Because of the potential for 
genotoxicity, male patients with female 
partners of reproductive potential should 
use effective contraception during the 
treatment with Zynlonta and for 7 months 
after the last dose.

Key safety findings (from non- clinical studies) 
SG3199 was determined to be clastogenic, consistent with 
its mode of action as a covalent DNA 
crosslinking/alkylating agent. Evaluation of mutagenicity 
of SG3199 in an Ames test was not possible due to the 
bactericidal activity of SG3199. 
Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with ICH S9 and ICH S1A no 
carcinogenicity studies were conducted with loncastuximab 
tesirine or SG3199 given the intended use in the treatment 
of patients with advanced cancer and the genotoxicity of 
SG3199. 
Safety pharmacology 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were 
conducted with ADCT-402. In accordance with ICH 
S6(R1), safety pharmacology endpoints were included in 
the GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicology studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Endpoints included were: 
•  Neurological examinations: general sensory 
aspects, cerebral reflexes (pupillary, orbicularis 
oculi) and spinal reflexes (patellar, anal). 
•  Neurobehavioral observations: vocalisation, 
grooming, posture, balance/coordination, 
locomotor activity, tremor, 
convulsion/twitches/jerks, muscle cramping, 
stereotypy, alertness, aggression, reaction to visual 
or acoustic stimuli, muscle tone and grip strength. 
•  Respiratory rate assessment. 
•  Cardiovascular investigations (8-lead 
electrocardiogram [ECG]; parameters determined 
included RR and PR intervals, QRS duration, QT 
interval, corrected QT [QTcF or QTcB] interval 
and heart rate). 
All the above endpoints were evaluated in the GLP 4-week 
study (Study 8303115) whilst in the GLP 13-week study 
(Study 8374716) only ECGs and blood pressure were 
evaluated. There were no ADCT-402-related findings on 
any of the endpoints studied (2.6.2 Pharmacology Written

Mechanisms for drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were 
conducted with ADCT-402 (2.6.2 Pharmacology Written 
Summary). 
In vitro studies have shown that SG3199 does not inhibit 
CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 at clinically 
relevant unconjugated SG3199 concentrations. In addition, 
in human hepatocytes SG3199 did not induce CYP3A4 or 
CYP2B6 mRNA or enzyme activity, whilst it was found to 
induce CYP1A2 mRNA expression without concomitant 
increase in enzyme activity. 
SG3199 is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not a 
substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, 
OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT)1.  
SG3199 does not inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1,

(2.6.4 Pharmacokinetics Written Summary). 
Other toxicity-related information or data 
Photoreactivity 
The potential effects of visible, ultraviolet (UV)A and 
UVB light on SG3199-mediated effects on the structural 
integrity of supercoiled plasmid DNA were investigated. 
These studies confirmed that SG3199 is photoreactive, and 
that exposure to visible light, UVA or UVB radiation 
enhance its ability to mediate DNA crosslinking and 
double-stranded breaks which may represent a contributory 
underlying mechanism to the epidermal hyperpigmentation 
and hyperkeratosis observed upon IV administration of 
ADCT-402 in vivo (2.4 Nonclinical Overview). 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been 
performed in humans. 
The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of 
SG3199 is indicative of a concern for 
photosensitivity reactions. Photosensitivity, 
manifesting as a skin reaction or rash, has 
been observed in patients treated with 
Zynlonta. 
In the 215 DLBCL patients treated with 
0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine, TEAEs 
of photosensitivity reaction were observed 
in 17 (7.9%) patients; all except one were

Part II:  Module SIII - Clinical trial exposure 
Two clinical studies contributed evidence for the safety of loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy in 
patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL: one pivotal efficacy study (ADCT-402-201) in 
patients with DLBCL, and one supportive first-in-human study (ADCT-402-101) in patients with 
B-cell lineage non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), including patients with DLBCL. Both studies 
were single-arm, open-label, and used loncastuximab tesirine as monotherapy. 
ADCT-402-201 is an ongoing Phase 2, multicentre, open-label, single-arm study of the efficacy 
and safety of loncastuximab tesirine in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The study 
has completed enrolment and 145 patients were enrolled at 16 centres in the United States (US), 
six centres in the United Kingdom (UK), five centres in Italy, and one centre in Switzerland. 
ADCT-402-101 was a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation (Part 1) and expansion (Part 2) study 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of loncastuximab tesirine in 183 patients with relapsed or 
refractory B-NHL. The study was conducted at eight centres in the US, two centres in the UK, 
and one centre in Italy, and was completed on 21 February 2019. There were 139 patients with 
DLBCL in this study. 
Loncastuximab tesirine was supplied in two product presentations over the clinical development 
lifecycle: an initial frozen liquid product and later a lyophilised powder drug product. The frozen 
liquid formulation was used for study ADCT-402-101, and the lyophilised formulation was 
introduced into study ADCT-402-201.  
In study ADCT-402-201, of the 145 patients who were enrolled and received loncastuximab 
tesirine, 35 patients received the frozen liquid formulation (for all dose cycles) and 110 patients 
received the lyophilised formulation (for all dose cycles). 
The dosing regimens were different between studies ADCT-402-201 and ADCT-402-101. 
A single dose regimen was used in study ADCT-402-201 with all 145 patients enrolled at 
0.15 mg/kg (150 µg/kg). Multiple dose levels/regimens were used in study ADCT-402-101, 
ranging from initial doses of 15 to 200 μg/kg and used to establish the recommended dosing used 
in the Phase 2 study. Among the 139 patients who were enrolled with a primary diagnosis of 
DLBCL, two patients were enrolled at 15 µg/kg, three patients were enrolled at 30 µg/kg, three 
patients were enrolled at 60 µg/kg, two patients were enrolled at 90 µg/kg (Part 1), 32 patients 
were enrolled at 120 µg/kg (Parts 1 and 2 combined), 70 patients were enrolled at 150 µg/kg 
(Parts 1 and 2 combined), and 27 patients were enrolled at 200 µg/kg (Part 1) (ADCT-402-101 
CSR, Table 14.1.1.2). 
In addition, there are three studies with loncastuximab tesirine in other indications or in 
combination with other therapies: 
•  ADCT-402-102 was a Phase 1 study of loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy in 35 patients 
with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL); it was 
terminated early because of slow accrual.  
•  ADCT-402-103 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 study of loncastuximab tesirine in combination 
with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL or mantle cell lymphoma 
(MCL).  
•  ADCT-402-104 was a Phase 1 study of loncastuximab tesirine in combination with 
durvalumab in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, MCL, or follicular

lymphoma. Enrolment for ADCT-402-104 was closed early on 21 November 2019, after 
13 patients had been enrolled and began treatment, as it was determined that there did not 
appear to be added benefit to the combination therapy as compared to loncastuximab 
tesirine alone.  
The key data sets for safety evaluation in this RMP are the monotherapy DLBCL population 
(Level 1) and monotherapy B-NHL/B-ALL population (Level 2). Level 1 included 284 relapsed 
or refractory DLBCL patients treated with loncastuximab tesirine as monotherapy from the 
ADCT-402-201 and ADCT-402-101 studies, which consisted of 145 patients from pivotal study 
ADCT-402-201 and 139 DLBCL patients from study ADCT-402-101. The subset of 215 patients 
who received 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy was the primary group analysed 
for safety as it represents the population that will be exposed to risk with the commercial product. 
Level 2 included 363 patients, which consisted of 145 DLBCL patients from study ADCT-402-
201, 183 B-NHL patients from study ADCT-402-101, and 35 B-ALL patients from study ADCT-
402-102. This level provided supportive analyses and a relevant larger safety database that 
included 328 patients with relapsed or refractory B-NHL. 
Level 3 is the loncastuximab tesirine all treated population, including all 468 relapsed or 
refractory B-NHL or B-ALL patients from the ADCT-402-201, ADCT-402-101, ADCT-402-102, 
ADCT-402-103, and ADCT-402-104 studies. However, Level 3 data are not further discussed as 
the number of patients treated with combination therapies was too small to make meaningful 
comparisons and the loncastuximab tesirine dosing in the combination therapies was limited to 
two doses for the majority of patients. 
The number of subjects treated in all 5 studies is provided in Table 5.

Pregnant or breastfeeding 
Reason for exclusion: 
Loncastuximab tesirine contains a genotoxic component, SG3199, which is a covalent DNA 
crosslinking/alkylating agent. Based on its mechanism of action, loncastuximab tesirine can cause 
embryo-foetal toxicity and/or teratogenicity when administered to a pregnant woman. There is no 
information regarding the presence of loncastuximab tesirine or SG3199 in human milk, the 
effects on the breastfed child, or milk production. For these reasons, and because of the potential 
for exposure of the infant, women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded from the 
study. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: 
Although no reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted with loncastuximab 
tesirine or SG3199, the demonstration that the SG3199 cytotoxic agent is a potent clastogen 
indicates a potential safety hazard to the foetus. Based on its mechanism of action, Zynlonta 
affects actively dividing cells and can cause embryo-foetal toxicity and/or teratogenicity when 
administered to a pregnant woman. The Zynlonta SmPC specifies that pregnant women must be 
advised of the potential risk to the foetus and women of reproductive potential should use 
effective contraception during treatment with Zynlonta and for at least 10 months after the last 
dose. Because of the potential for genotoxicity, male patients with female partners of 
reproductive potential should use effective contraception during the treatment with Zynlonta and 
for at least 7 months after the last dose. In addition, women should be advised not to breastfeed 
during treatment with Zynlonta and for at least 3 months after the last dose, because of the 
potential for exposure of the infant. Since the nonclinical findings suggest that use of Zynlonta in 
pregnant women may give rise to an undesirable clinical outcome, embryo-foetal toxicity is 
included as an important potential risk (Module SVII.1.2).

Absolute neutrophil count <1.0×103/μL (off growth factors at least 72 hours) 
Platelet count <75×103/μL (without transfusion in the prior 7 days) 
Reason for exclusion: 
The toxicity profile of SG3199 is characterised by dose-dependent myelosuppression associated 
with bone marrow hypocellularity. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: 
Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia are very common adverse reactions, which can be 
managed by dose modifications or delay in dosing if Grade ≥3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia 
occurs. Serious infections are not considered an important identified risk in this RMP but are 
described in Section 4.4 of the Zynlonta SmPC. Physicians are advised to monitor complete 
blood counts throughout treatment. Cytopenia may require more frequent lab monitoring and/or 
interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of Zynlonta. Prophylactic granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration may be considered as applicable. 
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT) >2.5×the upper limit of normal (ULN). 
Total bilirubin >1.5×ULN 
Reason for exclusion: 
Increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin, associated with centrilobular hypertrophy were observed 
in the toxicity studies with SG3199 (Part II Module SII). Loncastuximab tesirine has not been 
studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN and 
any AST). 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? Yes 
Blood creatinine >1.5×ULN or calculated creatinine clearance <60 mL/min by the 
Cockcroft and Gault equation 
Reason for exclusion: 
Minimal-to-marked nephropathy was noted at all dose levels in the pivotal 13-week toxicity 
study. With the exception of the observed fibrosis, these effects would be expected to reverse 
without measurable impact on kidney function (Part II Module SII). The effect of severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] 15 to 29 mL/min) and end-stage renal disease, with or 
without haemodialysis, on loncastuximab tesirine pharmacokinetics is unknown. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? Yes 
Pathologic diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma 
Reason for exclusion: 
Burkitt lymphoma is a very aggressive lymphoma. Accurate diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma is 
critical because Burkitt lymphoma and DLBCL are treated differently. Thus, inclusion of these 
patients could confound both efficacy and safety assessments. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Rationale: Loncastuximab tesirine as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and HGBL, after two or more lines of systemic therapy as 
specified in the Zynlonta SmPC. Burkitt lymphoma is a rare B-NHL and sometimes difficult to 
distinguish from the more common DLBCL but can be distinguished by flow cytometric 
immunophenotypic markers. Next generation sequencing studies have identified mutations 
associated with Burkitt lymphoma and helped in the 2016 WHO classification of Burkitt 
lymphoma facilitating distinction from DLBCL (Swerdlow 2016). Patients diagnosed with 
Burkitt lymphoma are not indicated for treatment with Zynlonta. 
Clinically significant third space fluid accumulation (ie, ascites requiring drainage or 
pleural effusion that either required drainage or was associated with shortness of breath) 
Reason for exclusion: 
Studies with other antibody products that employed the same PBD dimer toxin as loncastuximab 
tesirine reported TEAEs of serosal infusions including pleural and pericardial effusions (Collins 
2018, Hamadani 2018, Rudin 2017). Patients with pre-existing clinically significant fluid 
accumulation were excluded to avoid interference with the study results and impact on the safety 
and efficacy assessment. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: 
Oedema and effusion are classed as an important identified risk (Module SVII.1.2). The product 
labelling warns that oedema and effusion, which may be serious, have been reported in patients 
treated with Zynlonta, including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites, peripheral oedema, 
and general oedema. Patients should be monitored for new or worsening oedema or effusions and 
Zynlonta withheld for Grade ≥2 oedema or effusion until the toxicity resolves. Diagnostic 
imaging should be considered in patients who develop symptoms of pleural effusion or 
pericardial effusion, such as new or worsened dyspnoea, chest pain, and/or ascites such as 
swelling in the abdomen and bloating, and appropriate medical management for oedema or 
effusions initiated.

SIV.2  Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development programmes  
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged 
exposure.  
The primary safety evaluation data set comprised a total of 284 patients with relapsed/refractory 
DLBCL who received loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy (at doses of ≤ 0.09, 0.12, 0.15, 
0.20 mg/kg; N=10; 32; 215; 27, respectively). Adverse reactions occurring with a true frequency 
greater than 1 in 95 could be quantified in a data set of this size if the background incidence for 
the event is assumed to be zero (i.e., “common” or “very common” events). 
For Study ADCT-402-201, the median treatment duration in subjects treated with loncastuximab 
tesirine in the DLBCL pool (n=145) was 45.0 days (range 1, 351). The median number of 
treatment cycles that subjects received was 3.0 cycles (range 1, 15). Adverse reactions with a 
long latency or cumulative effects are not expected but patient exposure to loncastuximab tesirine 
in the clinical development programme is limited.

Patients with relevant comorbidities: 
•  Patients with hepatic 
impairment 
In the clinical development programme patients were included if they had 
adequate hepatic function at study entry (ALT, AST, GGT ≤2.5 x ULN; 
total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN) (Module SIV.1). No dose adjustment is 
recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 
≤ULN and AST >ULN, or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST); 
from the exposure-response (E-R) analysis of efficacy and safety, the 
exposure in the mild hepatic impairment subgroup was not associated with 
an increased safety concern (2.7.2 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology 
Studies). 
The impact of hepatic impairment was evaluated in the population PK 
analysis (n=328; studies ADCT-402-201 and ADCT-402-101 only). The 
majority of patients had normal hepatic function (n=277) or mild hepatic 
impairment (n=49); 1 patient had moderate hepatic impairment (2.7.2 
Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies). Due to the limited number of 
patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment (n=1), no associations 
between loncastuximab tesirine exposure and moderate/severe hepatic 
impairment can be made and such patients are an area of missing 
information (Module SVII.1.2). 
A hepatic impairment study will be conducted to determine a safe and 
appropriate dosing regimen of loncastuximab tesirine in patients with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Part III.2).

Exposure 
In the clinical development programme patients were included if they had 
adequate renal function at study entry (blood creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN or 
calculated CrCL ≥60 mL/min by the Cockcroft and Gault equation) 
(Module SIV.1). 
The impact of renal impairment was evaluated in the population PK 
analysis (n=328; studies ADCT-402-201 and ADCT-402-101 only) that 
included patients with normal renal function (n=159; CrCL ≥90 mL/min), 
mild renal impairment (n=118; CrCL ≥60-<90 mL/min), and 
moderate/severe renal impairment (n=51; CrCL ≥15-<60 mL/min). 
Creatinine clearance was not identified as a statistically significant 
covariate of loncastuximab tesirine PK, which is consistent with renal 
elimination not being a significant clearance pathway of loncastuximab 
tesirine. No clinically relevant differences in the exposure to PBD-
conjugated antibody were observed between patients with differing 
baseline renal function (2.7.2 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies).  
Overall, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment, based on the minimal magnitude of the effect 
of renal impairment on PK exposure, and that the renal elimination 
pathway is not expected to contribute significantly to the clearance of 
therapeutic antibodies or SG3199. Given that there was only 1 patient in 
the severe renal impairment subgroup, no definitive conclusion can be 
drawn for patients with severe renal impairment and such patients are an 
area of missing information (Module SVII.1.2).  
Study ADCT-402-311 will evaluate the use of loncastuximab tesirine in 
patients with moderate renal impairment (calculated CrCL ≥30 mL/min by 
the Cockcroft and Gault equation), but not those with severe renal 
impairment (Part IV) 
Patients with known history of uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure 
≥160/100 mmHg repeatedly), unstable angina, congestive heart failure 
(greater than New York Heart Association class II), electrocardiographic 
evidence of acute ischaemia, coronary angioplasty, myocardial infarction 
within 6 months prior to screening, or uncontrolled atrial or ventricular 
cardiac arrhythmias were excluded from participation (Module SIV.1). 
In the clinical development programme loncastuximab tesirine was not 
found to cause significant cardiac toxicity (Module SII). 
Seropositive patients requiring antiviral therapy for HIV were excluded 
from participation (Module SIV.1). However, other patients with 
underlying immunodeficiencies were not specifically excluded and it is 
likely that many patients would have some decrease in immune function 
related to their prior therapy. 
The proposed indication for loncastuximab tesirine as monotherapy is for 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and 
HGBL, after two or more lines of systemic therapy.  
Study ADCT-402-101 recruited subjects with pathologically-confirmed 
relapsed or refractory B-NHL (per 2008 WHO classification) whereas 
patients were included in Study ADCT-402-201 if they had a pathologic 
diagnosis of DLBCL, as defined by the 2016 WHO classification, to

Myelosuppression 
Among the 215 patients who received 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy, at least 
one TEAE occurred in 98.6% of patients. The 10 most common TEAEs included those of 
neutropenia (34.9%), anaemia (28.8%), and thrombocytopenia (28.4%) (Table 12). No notable 
differences were observed between the 215 patients who received 0.15 mg/kg and the 284

Myelosuppression is not an important risk of loncastuximab tesirine as it can be managed in 
clinical practice through healthcare professional awareness of the precautions to take with 
oncology therapeutic agents, patient monitoring, loncastuximab tesirine dose modification and 
G-CSF administration. 
The product information for Zynlonta requires that it should only be administered under the 
supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer 
patients.  
The Zynlonta SmPC instructs healthcare professionals to monitor patients for complete blood 
counts throughout treatment since cytopenia may require more frequent lab monitoring and/or 
interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of Zynlonta. Prophylactic G-CSF administration 
should be considered as applicable. 
Infections

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Serious cutaneous reactions have been reported in patients treated with loncastuximab tesirine. In 
clinical studies with Zynlonta oral and topical corticosteroids and anti-pruritic therapy were used 
to treat cutaneous reactions. The incidence of Grade 3 or higher events in the skin reaction and 
nail disorder AE group of particular interest in patients who received 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab 
tesirine monotherapy was 3.7% and included photosensitivity reaction (see Module SVII.1.2), 
rash (including exfoliative, pustular, and maculo-papular), and erythema. All were assessed as 
treatment-related.  
The following adverse drug reactions have been identified from post-marketing reports for 
Zynlonta in the US:  telangiectasia, blister, rash vesicular (Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue 
Disorders SOC). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain 
size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship 
to drug exposure. 
Serious cutaneous reactions (unrelated to exposure to sunlight) are a risk of loncastuximab 
tesirine not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP as these 
can be managed in clinical practice through healthcare professional awareness of the precautions 
to take with oncology therapeutic agents and will continue to be monitored via routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
The product information for Zynlonta requires that it should only be administered under the 
supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer 
patients.  
The Zynlonta SmPC instructs healthcare professionals to monitor patients for new or worsening 
cutaneous reactions and to withhold Zynlonta for severe (Grade 3) cutaneous reactions until 
resolution. If a skin reaction or rash develops, dermatologic consultation should be considered. 
•  Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile: 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Anti-drug antibodies 
(ADA) towards loncastuximab tesirine from patients participating in the clinical studies ADCT-
402-101, ADCT-402-201 and ADCT-402-102 have been evaluated (2.7.2 Summary of Clinical 
Pharmacology Studies). Screening, confirmation, and titration of anti-loncastuximab tesirine 
ADA were performed using a validated bridging electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay 
(ECLIA). From a total of 183 NHL patients and 145 DLBCL patients tested for ADA to 
loncastuximab tesirine, six (3.28%) patients in ADCT-402-101 and one patient (0.69%) in 
ADCT-402-201 exhibited confirmed positive ADA occurring at any time (Table 15). One patient 
exhibited a confirmed positive ADA which occurred at post-dose only, with a low log2 titre (<1). 
These data indicate that loncastuximab tesirine did not exert a clinically relevant ADA induction 
effect.

The impact of immunogenicity on safety was further evaluated in patients from loncastuximab 
tesirine from ADCT-402-101 and ADCT-402-201. The relative frequency of safety signals was 
compared in the ADA-positive (n=7) and ADA-negative subgroups (n=321). In general, there 
was no increased safety signal in the ADA-positive subgroup. It is noted that AEs of GGT 
increased and neutrophil count decreased/neutropenia were observed with higher relative 
frequency in the ADA-positive subgroup, possibly due to some confounding factors and limited 
number of patients in the ADA-positive subgroup. However, in general safety signals detected in 
the ADA-positive subgroup were no worse than those in the ADA-negative subgroup 
(2.7.2 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies).  
Overall, the potential risk for ADA-mediated adverse effects upon administration of 
loncastuximab is low. Consistent with this, no ADA-linked AEs were observed in the clinical 
trials with loncastuximab tesirine. As such, immunogenicity is not an important risk in the post-
marketing setting but will continue to be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance activities.

SVII.1.2. 
Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
Important Identified Risk 1: Phototoxicity 
Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that SG3199, the cytotoxic agent of loncastuximab 
tesirine, is photoreactive, and that exposure to visible light, UVA or UVB radiation enhances its 
ability to mediate DNA crosslinking and double-stranded breaks. This may represent an 
underlying mechanism for the observed dose-dependent skin changes (epidermal 
hyperpigmentation with hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis) in repeat-dose toxicity studies with 
ADCT-402 in cynomolgus monkeys (2.4 Nonclinical Overview). Among the 215 patients who 
received 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy, the TEAE of photosensitivity reaction 
was observed in 17 (7.9%) patients (16 [7.4%] treatment-related). Grade 3 photosensitivity 
reaction was observed in 3 (1.4%) patients, and all considered treatment-related. Dose delay 
occurred in 4 (1.9%) patients and treatment withdrawal in 1 (0.5%) patient as a result of 
photosensitivity reaction (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety, ISS Tables 1.3.10, 1.3.25, 1.3.14.1 
and 1.3.23)

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Grade 3 photosensitivity reactions have been reported in patients treated with loncastuximab 
tesirine. The benefit of loncastuximab tesirine as treatment for adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy outweighs this important identified 
risk of phototoxicity that can be managed in clinical practice through healthcare professional 
awareness and adherence to the guidance in the Zynlonta SmPC.  
The Zynlonta SmPC advises healthcare professionals to monitor patients for new or worsening 
photosensitivity reactions and to withhold Zynlonta for severe (Grade 3) reactions until 
resolution. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to minimise or avoid exposure to 
direct natural or artificial sunlight including exposure through glass windows and instruct them to 
protect skin from exposure to sunlight by wearing sun-protective clothing and/or the use of 
sunscreen products. A patient alert card issued to patients by prescribing physicians addresses the 
important identified risk of phototoxicity (Part V.2) ensuring that special information regarding 
the patient’s therapy with Zynlonta and its important risk of phototoxicity is always held by the 
patient. 
Important Identified Risk 2: Oedema and effusion 
The AE of oedema peripheral was one of the most common (≥10% of patients in all doses 
combined) TEAEs in DLBCL patients who received loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy 
occurring in 23.3% of the 215 patients who received 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine 
monotherapy (24.3% for all doses combined [n=284]). Pleural effusion occurred in 13.5% of the 
215 patients receiving 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine and 14.8% of the 284 patients (all doses 
combined). Oedema peripheral and pleural effusion were two of the most common treatment-
related TEAEs occurring in 16.7% and 11.2%, respectively, of the 215 patients receiving 
0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy (2.5 Clinical Overview).  
Risk-benefit impact: 
The benefit of loncastuximab tesirine as treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy outweighs this important identified risk of 
oedema and effusion that can be managed in clinical practice through healthcare professional 
awareness and adherence to the guidance in the Zynlonta SmPC. 
The Zynlonta SmPC instructs healthcare professionals to monitor patients for new or worsening 
oedema or effusions and to withhold Zynlonta for Grade 2 or greater oedema or effusion until the 
toxicity resolves. Diagnostic imaging in patients is suggested for those who develop symptoms of 
pleural effusion or pericardial effusion, such as new or worsened dyspnoea, chest pain, and/or 
ascites such as swelling in the abdomen and bloating. Appropriate medical management for 
oedema or effusions should be implemented. 
Important Potential Risk 1: Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Loncastuximab tesirine contains the cytotoxic agent SG3199, which was demonstrated to be 
clastogenic in in vitro studies, consistent with its mode of action as a covalent DNA 
crosslinking/alkylating agent. Severe depletion/degeneration of germ cells was observed in 
sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys in the pivotal GLP 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study 
(Module SII). Based on nonclinical genotoxicity findings and the mechanism of action of 
loncastuximab tesirine there is a risk of embryo-foetal toxicity during pregnancy. However, there 
are no data on loncastuximab tesirine exposure in pregnant women since pregnant females and 
women of childbearing potential or fertile men with female partners of childbearing potential

unwilling to use highly effective contraception were excluded from clinical trial participation for 
safety reasons (Module SIV.1; Module SIV.3).  
Risk-benefit impact: 
Whilst there is a risk of embryo-foetal toxicity during pregnancy, the benefit of loncastuximab 
tesirine as treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after 
two or more lines of systemic therapy may on a case-by-case assessment outweigh this important 
potential risk of embryo-foetal toxicity that can be managed in clinical practice through 
healthcare professional awareness and adherence to the guidance in the Zynlonta SmPC. 
The Zynlonta SmPC informs healthcare professionals that Zynlonta, based on its mechanism of 
action, can cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it 
contains a genotoxic compound (SG3199) and affects actively dividing cells. Healthcare 
professionals are advised to inform pregnant women of the potential risk to the foetus. Females of 
childbearing potential are advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Zynlonta 
and for 10 months after the last dose. Similarly, male patients with female partners of 
childbearing potential are advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Zynlonta, 
and for 7 months after the last dose. Zynlonta is not recommended during pregnancy unless the 
potential benefit for the woman outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Zynlonta is not 
recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Pregnancy testing is 
advised prior to initiating Zynlonta. 
Missing information 1: Use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
Use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is missing information based on the 
limited exposure in this population in the clinical development programme (Module SIV.3). 
Risk-benefit impact: 
The benefit of loncastuximab tesirine as treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy may outweigh the risk of use of 
loncastuximab tesirine in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment based on an 
individual risk-benefit assessment conducted by the prescriber. No dose adjustment of Zynlonta 
is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN 
or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST). However, the risk to patients with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment is currently not known. 
The Zynlonta SmPC informs healthcare professionals that Zynlonta has not been studied in 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN and any AST). 
In patients with hepatic impairment, monitoring for adverse reactions is recommended. 
Missing information 2: Use in patients with severe renal impairment 
There are very limited data on use of loncastuximab tesirine in patients with severe renal 
impairment in the clinical development programme and such patients are an area of missing 
information. 
Risk-benefit impact: 
The benefit of loncastuximab tesirine as treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy may outweigh the risk of use of 
loncastuximab tesirine in patients with severe renal impairment based on an individual risk-
benefit assessment conducted by the prescriber. No dose adjustment of Zynlonta is required for 
patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The Zynlonta SmPC informs healthcare

Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks 
Important Identified Risk 1: Phototoxicity 
Potential mechanisms: 
Phototoxicity is a chemically induced skin irritation, requiring exposure to light, that does not 
involve the immune system, whereby the skin response resembles an exaggerated sunburn. 
Loncastuximab tesirine contains a cytotoxic agent, SG3199, which has been shown to be 
photoreactive. Exposure to visible light, UVA or UVB radiation enhances the ability of SG3199 
to mediate DNA crosslinking and double-stranded breaks, which may represent a contributory 
underlying mechanism to the epidermal hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis observed upon IV 
administration of loncastuximab tesirine to cynomolgus monkeys in vivo (Module SII). 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
In clinical studies, of the 215 DLBCL patients treated with 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine 
monotherapy, photosensitivity reaction was observed in 17 (7.9%) patients with 3 of these 
patients (1.4%) experiencing a severe reaction. 
Minimal-to-moderate skin discoloration was observed in animal studies. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
The incidence of the most common (≥10% of patients in all doses combined) selected TEAEs in 
the skin reaction and nail disorder group of AEs of particular interest in the 215 DLBCL patients 
who received 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy was 46.5% with 44.2% assessed as 
treatment-related (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety).  
The most common specific events in this category (≥10%) included rash (20.0%), pruritus 
(11.6%), and erythema (10.2%). No notable differences were observed between the 215 patients 
who received 0.15 mg/kg and the 284 patients who received any dose of loncastuximab tesirine 
monotherapy. The incidence of Grade 3 or higher events in the skin reaction and nail disorder AE 
group of particular interest was 3.7% and all were assessed as treatment-related.  
Specifically, the TEAE of photosensitivity reaction was observed in 17 (7.9%) patients with all 
but one (16 [7.4%]) assessed as treatment-related (Table 16). Of the patients experiencing 
treatment-related photosensitivity reactions 3 (1.4%) were Grade 3 severity; there were no Grade 
4 photosensitivity events. No notable differences were observed between the 215 patients who 
received 0.15 mg/kg and the 284 patients who received any dose of loncastuximab tesirine 
monotherapy.

Among the 215 patients who received 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy, 4 (1.9%) 
experienced a photosensitivity reaction leading to dose delay and all were assessed as 
treatment-related. Treatment withdrawal occurred in 1 (0.5%) patient as a result of 
photosensitivity reaction (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety). 
In non-clinical toxicity studies with loncastuximab tesirine in cynomolgus monkeys, minimal-to-
moderate skin discoloration was observed, potentially related to phototoxicity, which correlated 
microscopically with epidermal hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis. These findings showed a 
trend towards reversibility, with reduced occurrence and/or severity following a 12-week 
treatment-free period (Module SII). 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Risk factors for phototoxicity (sun allergy) caused by loncastuximab tesirine include exposure to 
natural or artificial sunlight. However, the occurrence of such drug-induced photoreaction can 
vary from person to person according to ethnic group and geographic area, probably due to 
different skin types, sun radiation intensity, and use of sunscreen products or sun-protective 
clothing (Lozzi 2020). Some medical disorders and some concomitant medications can also 
increase sensitivity to sunlight. 
Preventability: 
The Zynlonta SmPC advises healthcare professionals to monitor patients for new or worsening 
cutaneous reactions, including photosensitivity reactions and to withhold Zynlonta for severe 
(≥Grade 3) cutaneous reactions until resolution. In clinical studies with Zynlonta oral and topical 
corticosteroids and anti-pruritic therapy were used to treat cutaneous reactions. Patients should be 
advised to minimise or avoid exposure to direct natural or artificial sunlight including exposure 
through glass windows. Healthcare professionals should instruct patients to protect skin from 
exposure to sunlight by wearing sun-protective clothing and/or the use of sunscreen products. If a 
skin reaction or rash develops, dermatologic consultation should be considered. A patient alert 
card issued to patients by prescribing physicians addresses the important identified risk of 
phototoxicity (Part V.2) ensuring that special information regarding the patient’s therapy with 
Zynlonta and its important risk of phototoxicity is always held by the patient.

Loncastuximab tesirine 
September 2022 
EU – Module 1.8 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Loncastuximab tesirine has been observed to cause photosensitivity reactions. However, relapsed 
or refractory DLBCL is a serious and life-threatening condition with limited effective therapeutic 
options (Module SI). 
The benefit of loncastuximab tesirine as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL, after two or more lines of systemic therapy, outweighs the important identified risk of 
photosensitivity that can be managed in clinical practice through healthcare professional 
awareness of this type of reaction due to the cytotoxic component (SG3199) of Zynlonta, and by 
adhering to the guidance in the Zynlonta SmPC that warns against exposure to direct natural or 
artificial sunlight including exposure through glass windows during use and recommends patient 
monitoring for new or worsening cutaneous reactions, including photosensitivity reactions. 
Zynlonta should be withheld for severe (Grade 3) cutaneous reactions until resolution.  
Phototoxicity will be further characterised using a targeted questionnaire beyond adverse 
reactions reporting and signal detection of routine pharmacovigilance (Part III.1). Both the 
ongoing study, ADCT-402-201 (Part III.2), and the post-authorisation efficacy study, ADCT-
402-311 (Part IV), will also provide additional safety information regarding phototoxicity. 
Public health impact: 
Nonclinical findings have suggested a potential risk of phototoxicity (Module SII), and 
photosensitivity reactions have been observed in humans. However, minimal impact on public 
health is anticipated since phototoxicity can be managed by preventative measures such as the 
wearing of sun-protective clothing, use of sunscreen products and avoidance of exposure to direct 
natural or artificial sunlight. 
Important Identified Risk 2: Oedema and effusion 
Potential mechanisms: 
Adverse event profiles of PBD-based therapies reported in the literature and early clinical data 
have included oedema and effusion TEAEs (see SIV.1). Loncastuximab tesirine incorporates the 
same PBD dimer toxin and hence PDB-associated events of oedema and effusion are similarly 
anticipated although the exact mechanism by which PBD elicits such reactions is not fully 
understood.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
In clinical studies, of the 215 DLBCL patients treated with 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine 
monotherapy, oedema and effusion reactions were observed in 78 (36.3%) patients. Oedema and 
effusion events were severe or potentially life-threatening in 5.1% and 0.5%, respectively, of the 
215 patients. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs for the oedema and effusion group of AEs was 36.3% 
(Table 17) with 27.9% being treatment-related and 5.6% being Grade 3 or higher of which 4.6% 
were treatment-related. Specifically, oedema peripheral occurred in 23.3% patients (16.7% 
treatment-related) and pleural effusion in 13.5% patients (11.2% treatment related) (2.5 Clinical 
Overview).

Grade 3 and Grade 4 oedema and effusion AEs were observed in 5.1% and 0.5%, respectively, of 
the 215 patients who received 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy. Of the most 
common serious TEAEs, pleural effusion occurred in 1.9% patients (1.4% Grade 3), pericardial 
effusion in 0.9% patients (0.5% Grade 3, 0.5% Grade 4), and oedema peripheral in 0.9% patients 
(all Grade 3) treated with 0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy. Treatment withdrawal 
occurred as a result of peripheral oedema in 2.8% patients (all assessed as treatment-related), and 
as a result of localised oedema, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion in 1.4% of patients each 
(assessed as 1.4%, 0.9%, and 0.9% treatment-related, respectively) (2.7.4 Summary of Clinical 
Safety). 
Based on outcomes from the Phase 1 study ADCT-402-101, and to mitigate toxicities such as 
oedema and effusion, dexamethasone premedication was introduced for the Phase 2 study 
(ADCT-402-201). Dexamethasone was administered over a course of three days, beginning the 
day before treatment, and the dose of loncastuximab tesirine was reduced following the first two 
cycles. In addition, treatment was held for any patient that experienced Grade ≥2 oedema or 
effusion until the toxicity resolved to Grade ≤1. As a result, a notable decrease was seen in 
patients who experienced oedema and effusion reactions in clinical study ADCT-402-201 relative 
to ADCT-402-101 (Table 17).  
Oedema and effusion were not evident as part of the toxicity profile of SG3199 in nonclinical 
studies in rats and dogs or of ADCT-402 in cynomolgus monkeys (Module SII). 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
DLBCL is mainly a disease of older individuals who may have other co-existing diseases. In 
general, risk factors for pleural effusion include congestive heart failure, cancer, pneumonia, and 
pulmonary embolism, whilst peripheral oedema may be caused by several different reasons 
including immobility, obesity, complications from heart, liver, or kidney disease, and pregnancy. 
Most of these conditions are associated with the older population and hence observed in patients 
with DLBCL. 
Preventability: 
Oedema and effusion can be managed in clinical practice through healthcare professional 
awareness of the precautions to take with oncology therapeutic agents and adhering to the 
guidance in the Zynlonta SmPC. The Zynlonta SmPC states that, unless contraindicated, 
dexamethasone 4 mg is to be administered orally or intravenously twice daily for 3 days, 
beginning the day before administering Zynlonta and advises healthcare professionals to monitor 
patients for new or worsening oedema or effusions. Treatment with Zynlonta should be withheld

for Grade 2 or greater oedema or effusion until the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or less. For 
patients who develop symptoms of pleural effusion or pericardial effusion, such as new or 
worsened dyspnoea, chest pain, and/or ascites such as swelling in the abdomen and bloating. 
diagnostic imaging should be considered and appropriate medical management for oedema or 
effusions implemented. Patients are advised to seek urgent medical attention if they develop any 
signs or symptoms of fluid retention such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or swelling in any 
part of their body. 
The product information for Zynlonta requires that it should only be administered under the 
supervision of a healthcare professional experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer 
patients.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Loncastuximab tesirine has been observed to cause oedema and effusions reactions. However, 
relapsed or refractory DLBCL is a serious and life-threatening condition with limited effective 
therapeutic options (Module SI). The benefit of loncastuximab tesirine as a treatment for adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, after two or more lines of systemic therapy, 
outweighs the important identified risk of oedema and effusion that can be managed in clinical 
practice through healthcare professional awareness of this type of reaction and by adhering to the 
guidance in the Zynlonta SmPC that warns of serious effusion and oedema and recommends 
premedication with dexamethasone. Both the ongoing study, ADCT-402-201 (Part III.2), and the 
ongoing post-authorisation efficacy study, ADCT-402-311 (Part IV), will also provide additional 
safety information regarding oedema and effusion. 
Public health impact: 
Oedema and effusion have been observed in humans. However, minimal impact on public health 
is anticipated since oedema and effusion can be managed by premedication with dexamethasone, 
monitoring of patients for new or worsening oedema or effusions, and withholding Zynlonta for 
Grade 2 or greater oedema or effusion until the toxicity resolves. 
Important Potential Risk 1: Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Potential mechanisms: 
Loncastuximab tesirine contains the cytotoxic agent, SG3199, which is a synthetic PBD dimer, 
where two PBD monomers are linked through their aromatic A-ring phenolic C8-positions via a 
flexible propyldioxy tether, creating a highly efficient DNA minor groove cross-linking agent 
with potent cytotoxicity (Hartley 2018). Although no reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies were conducted, the nonclinical genotoxicity observations for SG3199 are consistent with 
its mode of action as a covalent DNA crosslinking/alkylating agent and indicate that exposure to 
loncastuximab tesirine during pregnancy may interfere with normal growth, homeostasis, 
development, and differentiation of the foetus (Module SII). 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Use of loncastuximab tesirine during pregnancy has not been evaluated in the clinical studies 
(Module SIV.1) and there are no data available for loncastuximab tesirine exposure in pregnant 
women. However, loncastuximab tesirine contains a component that is toxic to actively dividing 
cells. Based on its mechanism of action, loncastuximab tesirine can cause foetal malformations or 
foetal death when administered to a pregnant woman.

EU – Module 1.8 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Findings from in vitro toxicity studies conducted with the cytotoxic component to assess 
genotoxicity may be relevant for humans and in the absence of data in humans suggest a potential 
safety concern. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded from clinical trial participation 
because of the potential harm that loncastuximab could cause to the foetus (Module SIV.1). There 
are no data on loncastuximab tesirine exposure in pregnant women (Module SIV.3).  
The cytotoxic component of loncastuximab tesirine, SG3199, was demonstrated to be clastogenic 
in an in vitro micronucleus test and a chromosome aberration assay, consistent with its mode of 
action as a covalent DNA crosslinking/alkylating agent (Module SII). Severe 
depletion/degeneration of germ cells was observed in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys in 
the pivotal GLP 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study (Module SII). 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Women of childbearing age and men with female partners of childbearing age who are not using 
an effective method of contraception during treatment with loncastuximab tesirine and for 
10 months and 7 months, respectively, after the last dose are at risk of toxicity to the unborn 
child.  
Preventability: 
Embryo-foetal toxicity can be prevented by adhering to the guidance in the product information. 
The Zynlonta SmPC informs healthcare professionals that Zynlonta, based on its mechanism of 
action, can cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it 
contains a genotoxic compound (SG3199) and affects actively dividing cells. Healthcare 
professionals are advised to inform pregnant women of the potential risk to the foetus. Zynlonta 
is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the woman outweighs the 
potential risk to the foetus. Pregnancy testing is advised prior to initiating Zynlonta. Females of 
childbearing potential are advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Zynlonta 
and for 10 months after the last dose. Similarly, male patients with partners of childbearing 
potential are advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Zynlonta, and for 7 
months after the last dose. Zynlonta is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not 
using contraception.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Loncastuximab tesirine has been demonstrated to be clastogenic in in vitro studies. Based on 
nonclinical genotoxicity findings and the mechanism of action of loncastuximab tesirine there is a 
potential risk of embryo-foetal toxicity during pregnancy. However, relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL is a serious and life-threatening condition with limited effective therapeutic options 
(Module SI). The benefit of loncastuximab tesirine as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory DLBCL, after two or more lines of systemic therapy, may on a case-by-case 
assessment outweigh the important potential risk of embryo-foetal toxicity that can be managed 
in clinical practice through healthcare professional awareness of embryo-foetal toxicity due to the 
cytotoxic component (SG3199) of Zynlonta, and by advising patients to adhere to the guidance in 
the Zynlonta SmPC of effective contraception during treatment with Zynlonta, and for 10 months 
after the last dose for women or 7 months after the last dose for men.

Public health impact: 
EU – Module 1.8 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Nonclinical findings demonstrate a potential risk of embryo-foetal toxicity. However, minimal 
impact on public health is anticipated since embryo-foetal toxicity can be managed by 
preventative measures such as the use of effective contraception during treatment with Zynlonta, 
and for 7-10 months after the last dose. In addition, Zynlonta is not recommended during 
pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the woman outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
SVII.3.2. 
Presentation of the missing information 
Missing information 1: Use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
Evidence source: 
In the clinical development programme, patients were excluded unless they had adequate hepatic 
function at study entry (ALT, AST, GGT ≤2.5 x ULN; total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN) 
(Module SIV.1). No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin ≤ULN and AST>ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST). Due to 
the limited number of patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment (n=1), no conclusions 
can be drawn about either loncastuximab tesirine exposure or AEs in patients with 
moderate/severe hepatic impairment. Hence, use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment is an area of missing information. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
Hepatic impairment may increase the exposure of unconjugated SG3199, however there was no 
clinically significant effect on loncastuximab tesirine pharmacokinetics observed in humans with 
mild hepatic impairment. The monoclonal antibody portion of loncastuximab tesirine is expected 
to be metabolised into small peptides by catabolic pathways. The small molecule cytotoxin, 
SG3199, is metabolised by CYP3A4/5 in vitro.  
Patients with mild/moderate hepatic impairment were associated with greater risk of death 
compared to patients with normal hepatic function. However, it is not clear whether this was 
attributable solely or partially to the trend of lower exposure to loncastuximab tesirine for patients 
with mild/moderate hepatic impairment determined from the population PK analysis, on the 
lower levels of albumin (and commensurate lower drug exposure) associated with their disease, 
on a more fragile overall health state, or a composite of these effects. It follows that maintaining 
the same dose level for patients with mild/moderate hepatic impairment as for patients with 
normal hepatic status is appropriate (2.7.2 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies). 
Use in patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment will be monitored using routine 
pharmacovigilance as well as being further characterised through conduct of a hepatic 
impairment study (Part III.2). 
Missing information 2: Use in patients with severe renal impairment 
Evidence source: 
In the clinical development programme, patients were excluded unless they had adequate renal 
function at study entry (blood creatinine ≤1.5xULN or calculated CrCL ≥60 mL/min by the 
Cockcroft and Gault equation) (Module SIV.1). Overall, no dose adjustment is recommended for 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, based on the minimal magnitude of the effect of 
renal impairment on PK exposure, and that the renal elimination pathway is not expected to 
contribute significantly to the clearance of therapeutic antibodies or SG3199. Given that there

was only 1 patient in the severe renal impairment subgroup use in such patients is an area of 
missing information. 
Population in need of further characterisation: 
Although Study ADCT-402-311 will include patients with calculated CrCL ≥30 mL/min (by the 
Cockcroft and Gault equation) to evaluate the use of loncastuximab tesirine in patients with 
moderate renal impairment (Part IV) patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) 
are excluded. Use in patients with renal impairment will be monitored using routine 
pharmacovigilance.

Tesirine in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) 
Rationale and study objectives: 
Primary Objectives 
•  To evaluate the efficacy of single-agent loncastuximab tesirine in patients with relapsed or 
refractory DLBCL 
Secondary Objectives 
•  To further evaluate the efficacy of loncastuximab tesirine 
•  To characterise the safety profile of loncastuximab tesirine 
•  To characterise the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of loncastuximab tesirine 
•  To evaluate the immunogenicity of loncastuximab tesirine

Study design: 
This is an ongoing Phase 2, multicentre, open-label, single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of 
loncastuximab tesirine used as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. To 
enhance patient safety, a 2-stage design was used, with an interim analysis for futility on the first 
52 patients. The duration of study participation for each patient was defined as the time from the 
date of signed written informed consent to the completion of the follow-up period, withdrawal of 
consent, lost to follow-up, or death, whichever occurred first. The study included a screening 
period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (cycles of 3 weeks), and a follow-up period (visits 
approximately every 12 weeks for up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation, regardless of 
disease status). Loncastuximab tesirine was administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes on

Day 1 of each cycle. Patients received 0.15 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 2 cycles, then 0.075 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks for subsequent cycles. Patients could continue treatment for up to one year or until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria, whichever occurred 
first. Additionally, patients benefiting clinically at one year could have continued treatment 
following a case-by-case review. 
Safety is being assessed based on AEs, serious AEs, treatment discontinuations due to AEs, 
periodic 12-lead ECG recordings, physical examinations, vital signs measurements, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, laboratory values, and pregnancy 
testing (for women of childbearing potential). AEs are being graded according to CTCAE 
version 4.0. 
Study population: 
This study has enrolled 145 patients (male or female), aged 18 years and older, with relapsed or 
refractory DLBCL (following two or more multi-agent systemic treatment regimens) with 
adequate organ function and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2. Patients had a pathologic 
diagnosis of DLBCL, as defined by the 2016 WHO classification, to include: DLBCL not 
otherwise specified (NOS); primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma; and high-grade B-cell 
lymphoma, with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements.

Additional Risk Minimisation Measures  
Patient alert card 
Objectives:  
To address the important identified risk of phototoxicity by ensuring that special information 
regarding the patient’s therapy with Zynlonta and its important risk of phototoxicity is always 
held by the patient and reaches the relevant healthcare professional as appropriate. 
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity: 
Zynlonta has been observed to cause photosensitivity reactions. A patient alert card will be 
employed as an additional risk minimisation measure to prevent the risk of photosensitivity, by 
emphasizing the need for patients to minimise or avoid exposure to direct natural or artificial 
sunlight including exposure through glass windows and to protect skin from exposure to sunlight 
by wearing sun-protective clothing and/or the use of sunscreen products. 
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
Patients are the target audience to receive the patient alert card, as provided by the prescribing 
physician prior to the initiation of therapy. The draft key messages for this additional risk 
minimisation measure are provided in Annex 6. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
The dissemination of the alert cards to medical institutions where they will be distributed to 
patients, will be tracked to ensure the Marketing Authorisation Holder has oversight of the 
implementation and management of additional risk minimisation measures. 
Spontaneous AE cases, including information regarding actions taken by prescribers and 
concomitant medications used by patients, provided through targeted questionnaires will be 
evaluated. Cumulative reviews will be submitted with each periodic safety update report (PSUR), 
and assessment will be made if there is any specific cause of concern that requires further 
mitigation.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Part VI:  Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Zynlonta (loncastuximab tesirine) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Zynlonta. The RMP details important 
risks of Zynlonta, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Zynlonta's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Zynlonta's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Zynlonta should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Zynlonta should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Zynlonta's 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Zynlonta is authorised as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), 
after two or more lines of systemic therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
loncastuximab tesirine as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Zynlonta’s benefits can be found in Zynlonta’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage <link to the EPAR summary landing page>. 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise these risks  
Important risks of Zynlonta, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Zynlonta’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly 
The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Zynlonta, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Zynlonta is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Zynlonta are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Zynlonta. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk 1: Phototoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In clinical studies, of the 215 DLBCL patients treated with 
0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy, photosensitivity 
reaction was observed in 17 (7.9%) patients with 3 of these patients 
(1.4%) experiencing a severe reaction. 
Minimal-to-moderate skin discoloration was observed in animal 
studies. 
Risk factors for phototoxicity (sun allergy) caused by loncastuximab 
tesirine include exposure to sunlight or artificial light. However, the 
occurrence of such drug-induced photoreaction can vary from person 
to person according to ethnic group and geographic area, probably 
due to different skin types, sun radiation intensity, and use of 
sunscreen products or sun-protective clothing. Some medical 
disorders and some concomitant medications can also increase 
sensitivity to sunlight.

Important identified risk 2: Oedema and effusion 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In clinical studies, of the 215 DLBCL patients treated with 
0.15 mg/kg loncastuximab tesirine monotherapy, oedema and 
effusion reactions were observed in 78 (36.3%) patients. Oedema and 
effusion events were severe or potentially life-threatening in 5.1% 
and 0.5%, respectively, of the 215 patients. 
DLBCL is mainly a disease of older individuals who may have other 
co-existing diseases. In general risk factors for pleural effusion 
include congestive heart failure, cancer, pneumonia, and pulmonary 
embolism, whilst peripheral oedema may be caused by several 
different reasons including immobility, obesity, complications from 
heart, liver, or kidney disease, and pregnancy. Most of these 
conditions are associated with the older population and hence 
observed in patients with DLBCL.

Important potential risk 1: Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Use of loncastuximab tesirine during pregnancy has not been 
evaluated in the clinical studies and there are no data available for 
loncastuximab tesirine exposure in pregnant women. However, 
loncastuximab tesirine contains a component that is toxic to actively 
dividing cells. Based on its mechanism of action, loncastuximab 
tesirine can cause foetal malformations or foetal death when 
administered to a pregnant woman. 
Findings from in vitro toxicity studies conducted with the cytotoxic 
component to assess genotoxicity may be relevant for humans and 
in the absence of data in humans suggest a potential safety concern. 
Women of childbearing age and men with female partners of 
childbearing age who are not using an effective method of 
contraception during treatment with loncastuximab tesirine and for 
10 months and 7 months, respectively, after the last dose are at risk 
of toxicity to the unborn child.

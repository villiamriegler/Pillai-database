1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Limited submitted on 7 November 2018 extensions of the marketing 
authorisation. 
The MAH applied for an addition of a new route of administration for intravenous use for Akynzeo, 
associated with a change in active substance (fosnetupitant, a pro-drug of netupitant), new 
pharmaceutical form (powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) and a new strength 
(fosnetupitant/palonosetron 235 mg/0.25 mg). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008, (1) point a and (2) points (c) (d) (e) - Extensions of marketing authorisations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0344/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).   
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0344/2018 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 28 April 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/2048/2/2016/II). The 
Scientific advice pertained to clinical aspects: 
• 
• 
The adequacy of the clinical plan to support the fixed dose combination in the proposed 
indication

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Akynzeo is currently licensed in adults as an oral capsule for the prevention of acute and delayed 
vomiting associated with both a) moderately and b) highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. The 
current application is a line extension for the intravenous formulation with the same indications. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common adverse drug reaction and one of the 
most feared reactions for patients.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features; Aetiology and pathogenesis 
 The pathophysiology of delayed emesis is less understood, and multiple mechanisms may contribute, 
including substance P. Substance P belongs to the neurokinin (NK) family of neuropeptides and exerts 
its biological effects via interaction with the NK1 receptor. 
Presently, a four-level classification of intravenous chemotherapy agents, based on incidence of 
emetogenicity (high >90%, moderate 30%-90%, low 10%-30% and minimal <10%) has been 
accepted by the major organizations producing recommendations on antiemetics. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
If severe enough, CINV can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, impaired renal function, metabolic 
alkalosis and aspiration pneumonia. Ensuring that patients can be as comfortable as possible during 
their regimens is crucial. Hence the role of anti-emetics in this clinical setting is preventative and an 
integrated part of the supportive care of cancer patients. Psychological problems associated with 
nausea and vomiting may include anxiety and depression. In addition, uncontrolled nausea and 
vomiting may also lead to the decision by the physician to reduce chemotherapy dose intensity or to 
the wish by the patient to stop potentially beneficial cancer therapy. 
CINV is classified as acute, occurring within the first 24h after chemotherapy, or delayed, occurring 
after the first 24h. The development of acute emesis is known to largely depend on serotonin (5-HT). 
The 5-HT3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response, thus 
providing a physiologic explanation for the demonstrated and clinically useful antiemetic effects of 5-
HT3 receptor antagonists (RAs). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Ensuring that patients can be as comfortable as possible during their regimens is crucial. Hence the 
role of anti-emetics in this clinical setting is preventative and an integrated part of the supportive care 
of cancer patients. Psychological problems associated with nausea and vomiting may include anxiety 
and depression. In addition, uncontrolled nausea and vomiting may also lead to the decision by the 
physician to reduce chemotherapy dose intensity or to the wish by the patient to stop potentially 
beneficial cancer therapy. 
Patients receiving HEC regimens or MEC regimens with anthracycline combined with cyclophosphamide 
should be treated with a combination of a 5-HT3 RA, NK1 RA and a systemic corticosteroid.

About the product 
Akynzeo is currently licensed in adults as an oral capsule containing palonosetron and netupitant for 
the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cisplatin-
based cancer chemotherapy and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. 
The proposed intravenous palonosetron-fosnetupitant fixed combination (Combination or FDC) is 
composed of palonosetron - (ALOXI) - a registered 5-HT3 RA, and fosnetupitant, a prodrug of 
netupitant, which is a NK1 receptor antagonist.  
Netupitant is practically insoluble in neutral or basic aqueous media and only very slightly soluble at 
acidic pH. Therefore, formulation or reconstitution into an aqueous solution was not possible. To 
circumvent this issue, a pro-drug approach was taken, using fosnetupitant which hydrolyzes rapidly 
following administration, exposing patients to the same therapeutic moiety in vivo, i.e. netupitant. 
Palonosetron is a well-known potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with demonstrated 
efficacy by the intravenous (I.V.) and oral route for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated 
with cancer therapy. 
The oral hard capsules formulation of Akynzeo was approved in the EU through the Centralised 
Procedure on 27th May 2015 (EU/1/15/1001/001).  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 28 April 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/2048/2/2016/II) as 
described above. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 0.25 
mg palonosetron (as hydrochloride salt) and 235 mg of fosnetupitant (as chloride hydrochloride salt). 
Other ingredients are: edetate disodium dihydrate, mannitol, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and 
water for injections. 
The product is available in single-dose flint glass vials with rubber stoppers and aluminium cap seals as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Palonosetron 
This application is a line extension and contains the same active substance, palonosetron 
hydrochloride, used to manufacture the already-approved hard capsules. The information presented by 
the applicant in the ASMF and full dossier for palonosetron hydrochloride is the same as was already 
assessed in the original submission, and subsequent variations. The active substance is sourced from 
the same manufacturer, manufactured with the same process and released in accordance with the 
same active substance specifications. 
Fosnetupitant Chloride Hydrochloride 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 9/90 
 
 
 
 
The original dossier for the hard capsules contains netupitant as the second active substance. 
However, netupitant is only very slightly soluble in water and thus, not suitable for administration in 
aqueous solution. Therefore, the applicant adopted a pro-drug approach, with the much more soluble 
fosnetupitant chloride hydrochloride as the second active substance in the powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion. The applicant submitted data demonstrating that in vivo, fosnetupitant is rapidly 
metabolised to netupitant, thus exposing patients to the same therapeutic moiety. As a result, a new 
ASMF for fosnetupitant chloride hydrochloride was submitted with the line extension. 
General information 
The chemical name of fosnetupitant chloride hydrochloride is 4-(5-(2-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-
N,2-dimethylpropanamido)-4-(o-tolyl)pyridin-2-yl)-1-methyl-1-((phosphonooxy)methyl)piperazin-1-
ium chloride hydrochloride is corresponding to the molecular formula C31H37Cl2N4O5P. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 761.53 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of fosnetupitant chloride hydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of 1H 
and 13C NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The 
active substance is achiral. 
The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by gravimetric vapour sorption and 
x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). It is a white to off-white to yellowish, crystalline, hygroscopic solid. 
Three polymorphic forms have been identified following extensive screening, requiring isolation from 
different solvent mixtures. Fosnetupitant chloride hydrochloride is always isolated as form I following 
the commercial manufacturing process. Since it is dissolved and lyophilised during finished product 
manufacture, particle size and polymorphic form are not considered critical quality attributes (CQAs) of 
the active substance and are not included in the specification. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. Five different manufacturers are responsible for 
various steps in the manufacturing process. 
Fosnetupitant chloride hydrochloride is synthesized in ten main steps using well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. The synthesis is the same as in the netupitant ASMF but with 
the addition of the steps to add the phosphonooxymethyl group. Initially, the applicant proposed to 
remove some of the earlier steps from the fosnetupitant ASMF. However, these were reinstated during 
the procedure to resolve a CHMP major objection.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 10/90 
 
 
 
 
The synthetic process uses a convergent strategy with the phosphate group being introduced via a 
third starting material. During this part of the synthesis, a mutagenic intermediate (05-PNET), which 
can dimerise to form a second mutagenic substance (05-PNET.i1), is employed. The process is able to 
purge these impurities but since they are mutagenic and used late in the process, they are nonetheless 
controlled in the active substance specification. 
Adequate in-process controls (IPCs) are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. The quality of the active substance used in the various 
phases of the development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed 
commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags which comply with the 
EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. A desiccant unit is placed within the outer bag 
and this is further stored within a heat-sealed Mylar/aluminium bag, within a metal drum. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identity (IR, HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), chloride content (titration), impurities (HPLC), purity (HPLC), genotoxic impurities (HPLC-MS 
and IC), residual solvents and base (GC), water content (KF), iodide content (IC), ammonium content 
(IC), and microbiology (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. Fosnetupitant is a 
prodrug of the principal impurity, 14-NETU, so from a toxicological viewpoint, its presence in the 
finished product has no impact. However, given its low solubility, an upper limit of 1% has been set in 
order to avoid precipitation problems during formulation and reconstitution. Limits for iodide and 
ammonium have been adequately justified. The limits for chloromethyl chlorosulfate, and two other 
genotoxic impurities have been set in line with the ICH M7 guidance. Their tests and limits were added 
to the dossier during the procedure in response to a CHMP major objection, on the basis that class 1 
and class 2 mutagenic impurities should be controlled by specification. Fosnetupitant chloride 
hydrochloride is always isolated as form I, controlled by the crystallisation solvent, so no test for 
polymorphic form is deemed necessary. Similarly, particle size doesn’t need to be controlled so no test 
is needed. Based on the result of the risk assessment according to ICH Q3D (see finished product 
section) and subsequent testing where no metal was detected above 30% of its permitted daily 
exposure (PDE), a test for elemental impurities is not mandated. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 9 batches ranging from pilot to production scale of the active substance were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 11/90 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability 
Stability data from 6 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (5±3 ºC), 
24 months under intermediate conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters 
were tested: appearance, water content, chloride content, purity, assay, related substances, 
polymorphic form, and microbiology (annually). The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release. All parameters remained within specification throughout the study under each set of 
conditions. The only obvious trend was a small increase in one impurity which remained well below its 
qualified limit. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch, indicating that 
fosnetupitant is photosensitive. 
Forced degradation studies were also carried out in solid state (high temperature and/or humidity) and 
in aqueous solution (acid, base, peroxide, variable temperature). In the solid phase, the higher the 
temperature and humidity, the more degradation was observed. In solution, degradation was observed 
under all conditions, more so under acidic and neutral conditions. Peak purity testing was conducted by 
diode array on the main active substance peak, which was spectrally pure, thus indicating that the 
HPLC method is stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months at 5±3 ºC in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a lyophilised powder intended for reconstitution and parenteral administration. 
Each vial contains 235 mg fosnetupitant (260 mg of fosnetupitant chloride hydrochloride) and 0.25 mg 
Palonosetron (0.28 mg of palonosetron hydrochloride). 
The current application is a line extension of the already-authorised Azynzeo hard capsules, containing 
300 mg netupitant and 0.5 mg Palonosetron. The aim of development was an injectable formulation. 
Netupitant is practically insoluble in neutral or basic aqueous media and only very slightly soluble at 
acidic pH. Therefore, formulation or reconstitution into an aqueous solution was not possible. To 
circumvent this issue, a pro-drug approach was taken, with fosnetupitant as active substance instead 
of netupitant. Fosnetupitant hydrolyzes rapidly following administration, exposing patients to the same 
therapeutic moiety in vivo, i.e. netupitant. 
In order to allow rapid reconstitution, development of a lyophilized powder was proposed. This also 
keeps all excipients and both active substances in the solid phase and thus, minimises the potential for 
incompatibilities. Given the instability of fosnetupitant with regards to hydrolysis, an injectable 
aqueous solution was initially thought to be too difficult to develop. 
A suitable formulation was developed, taking into account the stability and physicochemical properties 
of the active substances. Adequate controls were developed during manufacturing and a suitable 
container closure system was selected to allow a stable formulation in which fosnetupitant chloride 
hydrochloride is sufficiently soluble for an injectable solution. Palonosetron is freely soluble in aqueous 
media, and sufficiently stable, considering the process controls in place.

Fosnetupitant contains a phosphate group as part of the pro-drug section. Phosphate salts with 
divalent cations, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ found in the commonly used reconstitution medium, lactated 
Ringer’s solution, are known to be insoluble. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
Fosnetupitant is sensitive to heat as demonstrated by attempts to sterilise the bulk solution prior to 
lyophilisation. Furthermore, lyophilised powders don’t typically respond well to heat. Therefore, 
terminal sterilisation was not considered viable. Sterile filtration followed by aseptic processing was 
therefore selected as the best method for ensuring sterility. Based on the argumentation and data 
provided, this is considered justified. Filter integrity has been checked, as well as compatibility and 
bacterial retention capability which were all satisfactory. An extractables study identified several 
compounds, but based on toxicological evaluation and the levels at which they are present, no risk to 
patients can be reasonably considered. 
The lyophilisation process was optimised in terms of temperature, pressure and duration in order to 
minimise degradation and ensure an elegant cake is produced, as well as preventing mannitol 
crystallising as a hemi-hydrate which would increase the amount of water present in the resultant 
powder. A 3% overfill is added to each vial to allow withdrawal and administration of the full dose as 
per the label claim. 
The recommended reconstitution solvents are 5% glucose solution and 0.9% saline solution. 
Reconstitution in these media gives a final pH of 7-9 which is slightly basic, as required to prevent 
fosnetupitant degradation, but also within the acceptable range for parenteral administration. Solutions 
were demonstrated to be stable for up to 24 hrs without any observed precipitation. Osmolality was 
also within the desired range. Furthermore, the finished product was demonstrated to be stable under 
standard clinical setting when exposed to ambient temperature and artificial light, for up to 24 hours. 
Compatibility with plastic materials associated with common delivery kit was also investigated. 
Samples reconstituted in either 5% glucose or 0.9% saline were exposed to equipment made from 
various common plastic administration set materials. Samples were further exposed to artificial light. 
Samples were tested for colour and clarity of solution, pH and assay and impurities of each active 
substance. No anomalous results were observed for any of the samples except for new impurities in 
the polyurethane (PU) samples. Further investigation identified leachables present in reconstituted 
solutions exposed to PU for 1 day. However, they are also released in smaller quantity in glucose or 
saline solutions without the finished product. Moreover, it was argued that the contact time of the 
reconstituted product with these materials will be much shorter (a few minutes) in clinical practice and 
as such, no risk to patients is expected. Based on the levels of impurities present, this was accepted by 
CHMP. 
The primary packaging is flint glass vials with perfluoropolymer-coated rubber stoppers and aluminium 
cap seals. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. As the 
finished product is photosensitive, the vials are stored in an outer carton which offers suitable 
protection. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  five  main  steps:  compounding,  bioburden-reducing  and  sterile 
filtrations, filling into vials and partial stoppering, lyophilisation and crimping. The process is considered 
to be a non-standard manufacturing process due to the aseptic steps. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 13/90 
 
 
 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  on  four  production  scale  batches  of 
finished product. The following activities were validated and relevant reports provided: equipment and 
container  closure  sterilisation,  weighing  and  dispensing  of  active  substance  and  excipients, 
compounding,  bioburden-reducing  filtration,  sterilising  filtration,  filling  and  stoppering,  lyophilisation, 
crimping and visual inspection. Media fill studies were conducted and used to assign validated hold times 
at  various  points  and  these  have  been  acceptably  justified.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner.  Critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  have  been  defined  –  in  particular,  those  applied  to  the 
sterilising filtration and lyophilisation steps have been thoroughly discussed. The IPCs are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance  (powder,  container  and  reconstituted  solution  (visual),  reconstitution  time,  fosnetupitant 
identity (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC) and impurities (HPLC), palonosetron identity (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC) 
and impurities (HLPC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), pH of reconstituted 
solution (Ph. Eur.), sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The container closure integrity check (visual) is performed as an IPC. 
The limits for impurities have been adequately justified based on batch data. The limits for impurities is 
justified in that netupitant is the therapeutic moiety which is limited such that it does not cause 
precipitation and the others are pro-drugs which also hydrolys in vivo. Palonosetron is present in a 
much lower amount than fosnetupitant so the higher impurity limits are justified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data was 
provided demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of its PDE. 
Based on the risk assessment and batch data, it was concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for three production scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (5±3 ºC) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples 
were  tested  for  appearance  (powder,  container  and  reconstituted  solution),  reconstitution  time, 
fosnetupitant  assay  and  impurities,  palonosetron  assay  and  impurities,  water  content,  pH  of 
reconstituted solution, sub-visible particles, sterility, bacterial endotoxins and container closure integrity. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes were observed to any of 
the measured parameters, and for the most part, no obvious trends were observed. There is a slight 
increase in netupitant formation and water content, though both are well within the specification limits.

In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Samples were stored either in the primary vial, the vial within the 
secondary carton or the vial wrapped in aluminium foil as a dark control. Degradation was observed in 
the vial alone, but not in either of the other sample formats. Therefore, the finished product is considered 
to be photosensitive but the secondary carton provides adequate protection. 
An in-use stability study was conducted on samples following reconstitution in either 5% glucose or 0.9% 
saline, which are indicated to be the solvents of choice in the SmPC. Samples were stored for up to 24 
hrs without any significant degradation or precipitation. Furthermore, a microbiological challenge study 
was  performed,  indicating  that  the  diluted  product  has  bacteriostatic  or  bactericidal  properties.  As  a 
result, the reconstituted product is deemed stable for up to 24 hrs at 25 oC. The following text is included 
in section 6.3 of the SmPC: 
“Store the reconstituted and diluted solution below 25 °C. The product should be diluted immediately 
after reconstitution. Chemical, physical and microbiological in-use stability after reconstitution and 
dilution has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 25 °C. Other in-use storage times and conditions are 
the responsibility of the user.” 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months in a refrigerator (2-8 oC), with 
the vial in the outer carton to protect from light, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The major objections 
raised in relation to the starting materials and mutagenic impurities have been satisfactorily addressed. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Oral AKynzeo is a fixed combination of 300 mg netupitant, a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor 
antagonist, and 0.5 mg palonosetron, a serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. The characteristics of 
the drugs supported the development as a fixed-dose combination since their mechanism of action is 
exerted on different neuropathways (5-HT3 receptors and NK1 receptors) and both drugs show a

similar pharmacokinetic profile in terms of extended plasma half-life representing a rational and 
clinically-appropriate choice of antiemetic drugs. 
Fosnetupitant is the netupitant prodrug which has been developed to improve the solubility of 
netupitant and obtain a viable IV formulation. As fosnetupitant is rapidly converted to netupitant in 
vivo following IV administration, the pharmacology of fosnetupitant is mainly attributable to netupitant. 
The applicant has performed a bridging non-clinical development program for fosnetupitant and for 
fosnetupitant in combination with palonosetron. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Fosnetupitant and netupitant binding profiles on various neurotransmitters/enzymes were 
characterized. Netupitant is classified as high affinity NK1 receptor antagonist (pKi 9.0) and has 
approximately 1000-fold selectivity when compared to hNK2 and hNK3 receptors. 
The investigations on fosnetupitant revealed that it conferred more than 50% inhibition on the 
following receptor binding ligand activities: hNK1 agonist ligand (IC50 < 0.28nM), hNK3 antagonist 
and agonist ligands (IC50 = 0.8 μM and IC50 =0.42 μM, respectively), h5HT6 agonist (IC50 =6.3 μM), 
Ca++ channel (diltiazem site) antagonist (IC50 =2 μM) and Ca++ channel (verapamil site) antagonist 
(IC50 =5.4 μM). 
In vitro pharmacology of fosnetupitant was provided as published literature Ruzza et al., (2015). 
Considering that the applicant considers that the pharmacology of fosnetupitant is entirely attributable 
to its conversion to netupitant, the differences observed in substance P calcium mobilisation are 
interesting. Fosnetupitant possesses a three-fold higher affinity for the NK1 receptor and faster kinetics 
of interaction than netupitant. However, it is noted that different pharmacological properties can be 
attributed to fosnetupitant in vitro and in vivo. In vivo it appears that rapid conversion to netupitant 
occurs. Therefore, the in vivo pharmacological effects of fosnetupitant are likely due and attributable to 
netupitant.  
In vivo, netupitant and fosnetupitant were able to counteract SP induced nociceptive behaviour with 
superimposable efficacy and potency. In addition, based on the short half-life measured for 
fosnetupitant in mice (a few minutes), it can be accepted that the pharmacological effects of 
Pronetupitant can be interpreted as due to its conversion to Netupitant. Therefore, the studies 
presented for Netupitant alone in the initial approved MAA dossier for Akynzeo are also relevant for 
Pronetupitant.  
The in vivo effects of fosnetupitant and netupitant were evaluated in the scratching, biting, andlicking 
responses elicited by Substance P (SP) injected i.t. in mice. The two compounds at 10 and 1 but not at 
0.1 mg/kg were able to significantly counteract the nociceptive behaviour induced by SP in a similar 
and dose dependent manner. Therefore, the two compounds exhibited a similar efficacy and potency in 
this test.  
Due to the rapid conversion of fosnetupitant to netupitant (T1/2 was less than 12 minutes and the 
netupitant plasma peak concentration was reached in less than 3 min (Tmax), see 2.6.4 
Pharmacokinetics Written Summary) and to fact that the applicant considers the pharmacological 
effects of fosnetupitant can be entirely interpreted as due to its conversion to netupitant study in vivo 
studies in emesis models were not conducted with fosnetupitant or the fosnetupitant + palonosetron IV 
fixed dose combination. This is accepted.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
One study was carried out using the combination of fosnetupitant and palonosetron, to investigate the 
possible effects of the combination on cardiovascular function. In the telemetered dog study the 
intravenous administration of the combination (fosnetupitant + palonosetron) for 2 weeks did not 
induce any effect on arterial blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. However, alterations in 
atrio-ventricular conduction, ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation characterised by increases in 
PR, PQ, QT interval and QRS complex durations, ST segment, QT corrected QTc and QT shift were 
observed in the high-dose group (13.2/6 mg/kg/day). There were no effects on QT at low (1.32/1 
mg/kg/day) and mid-dose (3.95/3 mg/kg/day) levels. Changes in QT and QRS complex were 
attributed to the main netupitant metabolite, M1, and it was noted that plasma exposure of M1 is 
higher in dog when compared to human. Therefore, these findings may not directly correlate with 
human toxicity. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Fosnetupitant did not induce changes on behavioural, neurological or autonomic functions in rats at 
doses up to 39.47 mg/kg. Treatment with fosnetupitant at all dose levels did not produce any 
proconvulsant or anticonvulsant activity in the rat in the metrazol test. 
Fosnetupitant up to 30 μM possesses no liability for prolonging QT in the hERG expressed in HEK cells. 
Intravenous administration of fosnetupitant at doses of 1.32, 3.95 and 13.2 mg/kg once daily for 2 
consecutive weeks did not induce any alteration of toxicological significance on haemodynamic and 
electrocardiographic parameters of the conscious dog. 
Alterations observed in some of renal function parameters could be considered transient and of no 
toxicological relevance to renal function. Fosnetupitant affected GI motility at the high dose (79 mg/kg 
IV) in a similar manner to the reference compound, atropine. This is unlikely to be of biological 
relevance considering the expected therapeutic dose in human (235 mg IV). There were no changes of 
toxicological significance in respiratory parameters.  
Studies investigating the abuse liability of netupitant and palonosetron were presented. Given that 
fosnetupitant is rapidly converted to netupitant and that the main pharmacological action of 
fosnetupitant is attributed to netupitant these studies can be accepted in support of the lack of abuse 
liability of the fosnetupitant/palonosetron combination. 
One study was carried out using the combination of fosnetupitant and palonosetron, to investigate the 
possible effects of the combination on cardiovascular function. In the telemetered dog study the 
intravenous administration of the combination (fosnetupitant + palonosetron) for 2 weeks did not 
induce any effect on arterial blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. However, alterations in 
atrio-ventricular conduction, ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation characterised by increases in 
PR, PQ, QT interval and QRS complex durations, ST segment, QT corrected QTc and QT shift were 
observed in the high-dose group (13.2/6 mg/kg/day). There were no effects on QT at low (1.32/1 
mg/kg/day) and mid-dose (3.95/3 mg/kg/day) levels. Changes in QT and QRS complex were 
attributed to the main netupitant metabolite, M1, and it was noted that plasma exposure of M1 is 
higher in dog when compared to human. Therefore, these findings may not directly correlate with 
human toxicity.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of fosnetupitant and fosnetupitant + palonosetron IV fixed dose combination (IV 
NEPA FDC), were characterised consistent with EU Guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005. 
Netupitant studies have been submitted for the hard capsules, and previously assessed. 
The pharmacokinetics of fosnetupitant was investigated in rat, dog and monkey. Studies were 
conducted to determine absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion of fosnetupitant. 
Pharmacokinetic studies following IV single dose administration in preclinical species indicated that 
fosnetupitant was rapidly and quantitatively converted to netupitant with no excretion of unchanged 
prodrug in urine and faeces. 
The applicant has developed LC/MS/MS, UPLC-MS-MS and HPLC methods to determine the 
concentration of fosnetupitant, netupitant and its major metabolites M1, M2, and M3 in rat, monkey, 
dog and rabbit plasma, and dog heart and rat brain. The lower limit of quantification of fosnetupitant is 
3 ng/mL in rat, dog, monkey and rabbit plasma and the lower limit of quantification of netupitant is 5 
ng/mL in rat, dog, monkey and rabbit plasma 
In all studies fosnetupitant appears to be rapidly converted to netupitant, showing Cmax at the first 
sampling time, as fosnetupitant. Netupitant was detected in plasma up to 168 hours (median tlast) and 
its AUC, about 200-fold higher than that of fosnetupitant, represents the 34% of drug related material 
in plasma exposure to netupitant and its main metabolites are comparable with equivalent doses of 
netupitant and fosnetupitant. 
The human plasma protein binding of fosnetupitant was 92.14% at 1 μM and 94.86% at 10 μM.. The 
mean blood to plasma concentration ratio in humans was in the range 0.4-0.6 (mean concentration 
ratios of all the concentrations tested), suggesting that fosnetupitant was mainly distributed in plasma 
than in the red blood cells. However, no studies on protein binding with rat and dog plasma have been 
reported for fosnetupitant. In preliminary experiments, following a single intravenous administration in 
rats and dogs, fosnetupitant was rapidly converted to the active drug, netupitant: the low half-life was 
estimated at 28 min in rats and 12 min in dogs.  Therefore, in preliminary experiments performed, 
fosnetupitant, incubated in rat plasma, was degraded too quickly to make an accurate measurement of 
plasma protein binding.  In rats, plasma concentrations of netupitant (14-Netu), metabolites M1, M2 
and M3 were almost similar in animals receiving the pro-drug (fosnetupitant) and in those receiving 
the active drug (netupitant), thereby indicating the rapid hydrolysis of fosnetupitant to netupitant. A 
large netupitant concentration difference was detected in the brain, during the first 8 hours after 
administration, between groups dosed with fosnetupitant and netupitant. The Cmax of netupitant 
observed in animals receiving fosnetupitant was approximately 1/10 with respect to the animals 
treated with netupitant. The brain concentration of fosnetupitant was near the low limit of 
quantification of the analytical method and the brain/plasma concentration ratio at Tmax was 0.045%, 
which showed the low permeability blood brain barrier to pro-drug. Only metabolites M1 and M3 were 
detected in rat brain. 
Fosnetupitant and metabolite M2 were not detectable in the heart in dog studies. Netupitant and 
metabolites M1 and M3 were measurable in the heart. Metabolite M1 demonstrated accumulation, with 
the ratio between heart concentrations on D30 and plasma concentration 48h following the last 
administration ranging from 4.5 to 8.3. M1 was almost completely eliminated by the end of the 
treatment free period. 
The rat brain concentration of fosnetupitant, after single dose administration, was near the low limit of 
quantification of the analytical method and it was detectable only in the first minutes after 
administration, showing the low blood brain barrier permeability to prodrug. Only netupitant and its 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 18/90 
 
 
 
metabolites M1 and M3 were detected in rat brain and dog heart tissues after single and multiple day 
administration of fosnetupitant. 
In in vitro studies, rapid hydrolysis of fosnetupitant with subsequent release of netupitant was 
demonstrated in human liver, lung, kidney and intestine S9 fraction in the presence and in the absence 
of NADPH. Since conversion of fosnetupitant to netupitant can occur in the absence of NADPH, it is not 
thought to involve the CYP450 family of enzymes. 
Netupitant is then extensively metabolized to three major active metabolites: desmethyl derivative, 
M1; N-oxide derivative, M2; OH-methyl derivative, M3. In preclinical species administered with 
fosnetupitant, rat and dog, plasma exposure to netupitant and to its three main circulating 
metabolites, M1, M2 and M3, were comparable with the exposures measured after direct intravenous 
or oral administration of equivalent doses of netupitant. 
In both rat and dog, excretion was predominantly by the faecal route, with over 80% of the 
administered dose recovered in faeces. Less than 0.6% and 1.2% of dose was recovered in the urine in 
rats and dogs respectively. In dogs administered fosnetupitant intravenously, recovery was largely in 
faeces, indicative of biliary excretion. In rat and dogs, elimination was very slow. In rats excretion was 
not complete after 1 week following IV dosing, with 10% of the dose remaining in the carcass. 
The CYP450 inhibition potential of fosnetupitant was evaluated in human liver microsomes (HLM). In 
the range of concentrations tested (0.3-1000 μM), fosnetupitant was a moderate to weak inhibitor of 
CYP2C9 (IC50 = 27.9 μM), CYP2C19 (IC50 = 46.1 μM), CYP2C8 (IC50 = 56.7 μM), CYP2B6 (IC50 = 
106.8 μM), CYP1A2 (IC50 = 208.4 μM), CYP2D6 (IC50 = 217.2 μM) andCYP3A4 (IC50 = 196.8 μM and 
299.2 with midazolam and testosterone substrates, respectively). 
In addition, fosnetupitant did not show TDI potential of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in the concentrations 
range from 0.3 to 300 μM, up to 30 minutes of pre-incubation time. 
Possible interactions of fosnetupitant with human ABC (efflux) transporters and the human uptake 
(SLC) transporters were studied in vitro. Fosnetupitant was a moderate inhibitor of OATP1B3 (IC50 = 
17.34 μM), OATP1B1 (IC50 = 19.01 µM), MATE1 (IC50 = 29.48 µM), MDR1 (47% Inh. at 50 μM) and a 
substrate for the uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
However, given that fosnetupitant is rapidly metabolised to netupitant in vivo interactions between 
netupitant and CYP450 enzymes or transporters may be more clinically relevant. Netupitant in vitro 
and in vivo DDI studies have been performed as part of the AKYNZEO® hard capsules registration 
program. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicology studies focused on the characterization of fosnetupitant and fosnetupitant + palonosetron 
IV fixed dose combination (IV NEPA FDC), consistent with EU Guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005 on non-clinical development of fixed combination medicinal product. 
Toxicology studies with netupitant alone and as fixed combination with palonosetron were previously 
assessed during the initial MAA procedure. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicology studies were not carried out. A variety of repeat dose toxicity studies were 
carried out by the applicant for fosnetupitant (non-pivotal and pivotal) and fosnetupitant and 
palonestran in combination (pivotal). 
Repeat Dose Toxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020

The main toxicity findings in rats was mild centrilobular liver hypertrophy for males and females 
treated with the high dose. In the 4-week study these changes consisted of dose-related centrilobular 
hypertrophy associated with increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia, of moderate degree in the high dose 
group males and of mild degree in the high dose group females and mid-dose group males. This 
change was correlated with trend of increased liver weight. Liver weights resumed to control levels 
after the recovery period. No phospholipidosis was observed in toxicology studies in rat with 
fosnetupitant up to 39.47 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 30 mg/kg/day of netupitant). Absence of 
phospholipidosis signs was also noted in a 2-week and 4-week studies in dogs administered up to 
13.16 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/day of netupitant). 
In dogs treated with fosnetupitant treatment-related changes were noted in the thymus of three males 
and one female of the high-dose group following microscopic examination, which consisted of mild 
atrophy of the thymic cortex, characterised by depletion of lymphocytes. No treatment related changes 
were noted after the recovery period. 
In the pivotal combination study CNS effects were seen after repeated treatment and were likely due 
to the high dose of palonosetron. Intravenous administration of fosnetupitant- palonosetron 
combination resulted in adverse effects at the injections sites at the high-dose combination and in 
changes in cardiovascular parameters at the mid and high dose combination. Fosnetupitant did not 
show any evidence of QT prolongation in in-vitro (hERG channel study) and in-vivo studies in dogs. In 
a 2-week and 4-week toxicology study in dogs and in the 2-week telemetered dog study QT 
prolongation was not observed up to 13.16 mg/kg. The QT prolongation observed with the IV 
combination fosnetupitant/palonosetron at high doses was seen also in oral combination 
(netupitant/palonosetron) but only after repeated administration. 
TK data from two IV fosnetupitant toxicology studies involving rats and dogs in which fosnetupitant 
was administered IV for 14 days were presented by the applicant. For IV fosnetupitant and oral 
netupitant, toxicokinetic data from these rat and dog studies demonstrate that substantial netupitant 
exposure was achieved. Based on the rapid conversion the T1/2 was less than 12 minutes and on the 
netupitant plasma peak concentration was reached in less than 3 min (Tmax), the toxicology profile of 
fosnetupitant can be attribute mainly to netupitant. 
No phospholipidosis was observed in toxicology studies in rat with fosnetupitant up to 39.47 
mg/kg/day (equivalent to 30 mg/kg/day of netupitant). Absence of phospholipidosis signs was also 
noted in a 2-week and 4-week studies in dogs administered up to 13.16 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/day of 
netupitant). 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of fosnetupitant has been studied with respect to gene mutations in bacteria and 
mammalian cells and chromosomal aberrations in-vitro and in-vivo. Additionally, tests of primary DNA 
damage in-vitro and malignant cell transformation have been conducted. Fosnetupitant does not show 
mutagenic activity or potential for chromosomal damage. It does not induce structural chromosomal 
aberrations in human lymphocytes, and when administered to rats by intravenous injection, does not 
induce micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes. 
Various genotoxic impurities have also been tested for mutagenic potential. Chloromethyl 
chlorosulphate, 05-PNET and 05-PNET.i1 are considered to be mutagenic and therefore in line with ICH 
M7 their presence in batches must be documented. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were carried out and this is considered acceptable given the short duration 
of treatment.

Reproduction toxicity 
Fosnetupitant had no relevant effects on fertility up to 39.47 mg/kg/day. Studies conducted in order to 
assess the potential for embryofoetal developmental toxicity were carried out in both rats and rabbits. 
Effects in embryofetal development were observed mainly at high dose level. In the rat studies no 
malformations were detected in the foetuses of the low and mid-dose groups (3.95 and 13.16 
mg/kg/day respectively). One foetus with malformation (hindlimb malrotated) and one dead foetus 
were observed in the high dose group. Skeletal examination of foetuses demonstrated that no 
ossification of pubis was detected in 6 foetuses of the high dose group (39.47 mg/kg/day). 
For studies in rabbits there were no treatment-related effects for the skeletal examination of fetuses at 
any dose level. A slight increase in intrauterine deaths was recorded in treated groups with statistically 
significance in the mid- and high dose groups (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg/day respectively). 
In the pre and post-natal development study the main effect was a decrease in body weight for the 
females of F0 generation receiving the high dose (39.47 mg/kg/day). Reduction in body weight was 
also observed for the F1 generation of the high dose group. The mid dosage of 13.16 mg/kg/day was 
considered the NOAEL for dams and pups of F0 and F1 generations, in terms of development of the 
conceptus and the offspring. No effects were noted in the reproductive performance of F1 generation. 
For the F2 there were no relevant effects, only a delay the pre-weaning test (startle response to 
sound) was noted in the high dose group. 
The applicant attributes the toxicology profile of fosnetupitant to netupitant, due to the rapid 
conversion of fosnetupitant to netupitant, however there are differences in the outcome of the EFD 
studies of fosnetupitant compared to the studies carried out for netupitant:  
•  Netupitant; cleft palate occurred, in rats, in three foetuses from a single litter at 100 mg/kg, 
and in rabbits in the pilot study at 30 mg/kg. 
• 
Fosnetupitant; In rat studies at skeletal examination of foetuses, no ossification of pubis was 
detected in 6 foetuses of the high dose group distributed in 3 different litters. In rabbits an 
increase in intrauterine deaths was recorded in treated groups with statistically significance in 
the mid- and high dose groups (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg/day respectively).  
Although there were apparent differences in the outcome of the EFD studies of fosnetupitant 
compared to the studies carried out with netupitant, the relevant findings were mainly related to 
the bone formation (cleft palate and ossification of pubis). As demonstrated in the literature, the 
absence of Substance P results in a slight reduction of bone resorption rate but concomitantly in a 
critical reduction of bone formation and mineralization rate. Therefore, the absence of substance P 
could be relevant during bone formation and therefore have an impact on embryo-foetal 
development. Effects related to bone formation, probably as a result of effects on Substance P, are 
common to both netupitant and fosnetupitant, and these manifested in different ways in the 
different studies. 
Local tolerance  
Local tolerance studies conducted in order to assess the tolerance to fosnetupitant in animal models 
showed a good tolerability of the intravenous combination. 
Other toxicity studies 
Fosnetupitant was not antigenic in guinea pigs. Fosnetupitant is classified as phototoxic. Even though 
the results achieved with fosnetupitant and netupitant were very similar, netupitant was classed as

non-phototoxic in a previous assessment. This is due to changes in the criteria for classification 
introduced in the latest guideline for phototoxicity (OECD guideline 432). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The available data suggest that the fixed dose combination of fosnetupitant/palonestron is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation: 
• 
determination of a log Kow for fosnetupitant using method OECD 123   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
 Non-clinical studies indicate that palonosetron, only at very high concentrations, may block ion 
channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarisation and prolong action potential duration. 
Degeneration of seminiferous epithelium was associated with palonosetron following a one month oral 
repeat dose toxicity study in rats.  Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Only 
limited data from animal studies are available regarding the placental transfer (see SmPC section 4.6).  
Palonosetron is not mutagenic. High doses of palonosetron (each dose causing at least 15 times the 
human therapeutic exposure) applied daily for two years caused an increased rate of liver tumours, 
endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal medulla) and skin tumours in rats but not 
in mice. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but because of the high doses employed 
and since the medicinal product is intended for single application in humans, these findings are not 
considered relevant for clinical use. 
Non-clinical studies indicate that netupitant and its metabolites and the combination with palonosetron 
only at very high concentrations may block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarisation 
and prolong action potential duration. Reproductive studies in animals with netupitant do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, parturition or postnatal development. An 
increased incidence of positional foetal abnormalities of the limbs and paws, fused sternebrae and 
agenesis of accessory lung lobe were observed following daily administration of netupitant in rabbits at 
10 mg/kg/day and higher during the period of organogenesis. In a pilot dose range finding study in 
rabbits, cleft palate, microphtalmia and aphakia were observed in four foetuses from one litter in the 
30 mg/kg/day group. The relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. No data from animal 
studies with netupitant are available regarding placental transfer and lactation. Netupitant is not 
mutagenic.  
Effects in non-clinical studies based on safety pharmacology and single and repeated dose toxicity 
were observed only at exposures considered in excess of the maximum human exposure, indicating 
little relevance to clinical use. Phospholipidosis (foamy macrophages) has been observed with the 
administration of netupitant after repeated administration in rats and dogs. The effects were reversible 
or partially reversible after the recovery period. The significance of these findings in humans is 
unknown.  
The pharmacology of fosnetupitant has been studied in in vitro and in vivo models to characterize its 
activity as an NK1 receptor antagonist. Safety pharmacology studies were also conducted. 
Fosnetupitant and netupitant binding profiles on various neurotransmitters/enzymes were 
characterized. Netupitant is classified as high affinity NK1 receptor antagonist (pKi 9.0) and has 
approximately 1000-fold selectivity when compared to hNK2 and hNK3 receptors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 22/90 
 
 
 
In vitro, fosnetupitant possesses a three-fold higher affinity for the NK1 receptor and faster kinetics of 
interaction than netupitant. This may prevent conversion of a portion of fosnetupitant to netupitant.  In 
CHO cells fosnetupitant appears to be more potent than netupitant at every time point tested when 
both are used at 100 nM (Ruzza et al., 2015). However, different pharmacological properties can be 
attributed to fosnetupitant in vitro and in vivo. In vivo it appears that rapid conversion to netupitant 
occurs. Therefore, the in vivo pharmacological effects of fosnetupitant are likely due and attributable to 
netupitant. 
The in vivo effects of fosnetupitant and netupitant were evaluated in the scratching, biting, and licking 
responses elicited by Substance P (SP) injected i.t. in mice. Therefore, the pharmacological effects of 
fosnetupitant can be generally interpreted as due to its conversion to netupitant 
Safety pharmacology studies and abuse liability studies were also conducted. No effects on CNS and on 
respiratory functions have been observed with fosnetupitant. Fosnetupitant up to 30 μM possesses no 
liability for prolonging QT in the hERG expressed in HEK cells. In a 2-week and 4-week toxicology 
study in dogs and in the 2-week telemetered dog study QT prolongation was not observed up to 13.16 
mg/kg. 
In rat, dog and monkey, after intravenous administration, fosnetupitant was quickly converted to 
netupitant. Netupitant was then extensively metabolized to three major active metabolites: desmethyl 
derivative, M1; N-oxide derivative, M2; OH-methyl derivative, M3. The administered dose of 
fosnetupitant was almost quantitatively converted to netupitant that was eliminated by biliary 
excretion and hepatic metabolism (mainly mediated by CYP3A and lesser extent by CYP2C9 and 
CYP2D6 in humans). In rat and dog the unchanged prodrug was no excreted in urine and feaces. 
Based on in vitro data and the in silico predictions, a relevant clinical interaction of fosnetupitant with 
co-administered drugs is considered unlikely. 
In 2-week and 4-week toxicology studies with fosnetupitant in rats, the main change observed was 
mild centrilobular liver hypertrophy for males and females treated mainly with the high dose. This 
change was correlated with a trend of increased liver weight. Liver weight resumed to control levels 
after the recovery period. 
Phospholipidosis, observed with oral netupitant administration, was not observed in toxicology studies 
in rat with fosnetupitant up to 39.47 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 30 mg/kg/day of netupitant). Absence 
of phospholipidosis signs was also noted in a 2-week and 4-week studies in dogs administered up to 
13.16 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/day of netupitant). This may be related to the different route of 
administration. 
Fosnetupitant does not show mutagenic activity or potential for chromosomal damage. 
Fosnetupitant had no relevant effects on fertility up to 39.47 mg/kg/day. Studies conducted in order to 
assess the potential for embryofoetal developmental toxicity were carried out in both rats and rabbits. 
Effects in embryofetal development were observed mainly at high dose level. In the rat studies no 
malformations were detected in the foetuses of the low and mid-dose groups (3.95 and 13.16 
mg/kg/day respectively). One foetus with malformation (hindlimb malrotated) and one dead foetus 
were observed in the high dose group. At skeletal examination of foetuses, no ossification of pubis was 
detected in 6 foetuses of the high dose group (39.47 mg/kg/day).  
For studies in rabbits there were no treatment-related effects for the skeletal examination of fetuses at 
any dose level. A slight increase in intrauterine deaths was recorded in treated groups with statistically 
significance in the mid- and high dose groups (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg/day respectively). 
The toxicology profile of fosnetupitant to netupitant, is attributed to the rapid conversion of 
fosnetupitant to netupitant, however there are differences in the outcome of the EFD studies of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020

fosnetupitant compared to the studies carried out for netupitant. For netupitant, cleft palate occurred, 
in rats, in three foetuses from a single litter at 100 mg/kg, and in rabbits in the pilot study at 30 
mg/kg. These effects are all related to bone formation. Substance P is known to play a role in bone 
formation, therefore, effects on bone formation are common to both netupitant and fosnetupitant, 
manifested in different ways, and are probably due to effects of netupitant and fosnetupitant on 
Substance P. 
In the pre and post-natal development study the main effect was a decrease in body weight for the 
females of F0 generation receiving the high dose (39.47 mg/kg/day). Reduction in body weight was 
also observed for the F1 generation of the high dose group. The mid dosage of 13.16 mg/kg/day was 
considered the NOAEL for dams and pups of F0 and F1 generations. No effects were noted in the 
reproductive performance of F1 generation. For the F2 there were no relevant effects, only a delay the 
preweaning test (startle response to sound) was noted in the high dose group. 
Fosnetupitant does not induce eye and dermal irritation. Neither does it induce dermal sensitisation nor 
active and passive anaphylaxis in vivo. 
Fosnetupitant is well tolerated when administered intravenously. Local tolerance results in animal 
models showed a good tolerability of the intravenous combination.  
Intravenous and Intra-arterial administration in rabbits has showed very slight to mild erythema; no 
changes were noted at microscopic examination. Paravenous administration (a non-intended clinical 
route/misapplication) in rabbits: for the clinical signs very slight to mild erythema and very slight 
oedema were observed. At microscopic examination chronic inflammation (from mild to moderate), 
epidermal hyperplasia (from minimal to mild) of dermis were reported. 
Fosnetupitant is classified as phototoxic (see also discussion on Clinical Safety). Even though the 
results achieved with fosnetupitant and netupitant were very similar, netupitant was classed as non-
phototoxic in a previous assessment. This is due to changes in the criteria for classification introduced 
in the latest guideline for phototoxicity (OECD guideline 432). 
The available data suggest that the fixed dose combination of fosnetupitant/palonestron is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

palonosetron. Fosnetupitant is a water soluble phosphorylated pro-drug of netupitant rapidly converted 
to netupitant in vivo following IV administration. A pro-drug of netupitant was developed in order to 
ameliorate the local tolerability compared to the original IV formulation of netupitant. 
The proposed indication for IV NEPA FDC (in adults) is the same as oral Akynzeo®:

Prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic 
cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. 
Prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic 
cancer chemotherapy. 
The clinical pharmacology program for the IV NEPA FDC includes one safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) 
dose escalation study (PNET-12-23) and two additional studies; a drug-drug interaction study with 
dexamethasone (PNET-13-63) conducted with fosnetupitant only, and a PK study in cancer patients 
following administration of the proposed commercial IV NEPA FDC (NEPA-15-19). 
An in silico physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling study was also conducted to 
predict the in vivo impact of fosnetupitant interactions with CYP isoforms and efflux/uptake 
transporters observed in vitro on the PK profile of relevant drug substrates (PNET-16-29). 
Methods 
Analytical methods 
Table 4 contains a summary of the bioanalytical methods for the quantification of fosnetupitant, 
netupitant and its metabolites M1, M2 and M3, in human plasma. Table 5 overviews the method for 
palonosetron and M9 quantification in human plasma. 
All methods underwent pre-study validation. The bioanalytical assays showed good overall 
performance and the results obtained were of the required quality and integrity. Sample handling was 
acceptable. Certificates of Analysis for reference standards were provided. The bioanalysis of PK 
samples and incurred samples reanalysis (ISR) samples were conducted in accordance with the 
principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). The bioanalytical procedures of the laboratories were GLP 
certified. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
PK parameters were calculated from plasma concentrations of fosnetupitant (pro-netupitant), 
netupitant, netupitant metabolites M1, M2 and M3, and palonosetron by non-compartmental methods 
using SAS software (Versions 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4). 
Statistical methods 
In study PNET-12-23, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on log transformed data was used to 
estimate the relative availability factor of netupitant from IV pro-netupitant versus oral netupitant 
(from the FDC) and its variability. This was obtained by fitting the following linear model (using SAS 
PROC MIXED): log (AUC/dose) = Treatment + Dose + Period + Sequence + Subject(Sequence) + 
Error. The antilog of the estimate of the treatment’s effect difference (IV – oral) was the estimate of 
the relative availability factor. 
In study PNET-13-63, log-transformed exposure parameters for dexamethasone given alone (IMP 2) 
and co-administered with pro-netupitant (IMP 1 + IMP 2) were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA 
with fixed factors for period and treatment and a random factor for subject. The parametric point 
estimators for the ratios (IMP 1 + IMP 2)/IMP 2 and the 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated 
using the adjusted least squares means from the ANOVA of log-transformed data with subsequent 
Assessment report

exponential transformation. Results were then exponential back-transformed to obtain point estimators 
(i.e., geometric mean ratio) and 90% CI as percent. 
Absorption 
Fosnetupitant/palonosetron FDC is administered intravenously. Therefore, absolute bioavailability of 
combined drugs is complete (100%). 
Bioequivalence 
Study PNET-12-23 was a Phase I, double-blind, controlled, parallel groups, unbalanced single 
ascending dose study to assess the safety of intravenously administered pro-netupitant combined with 
crossover study extensions to estimate the dose of intravenous pro-netupitant yielding equivalent drug 
exposure as oral netupitant 300 mg/palonosetron 0.5 mg fixed dose combination in healthy male and 
female adult volunteers. 
A total of 160 subjects were randomized into the study, of which 130 subjects were randomised to the 
crossover treatment.  
Figure 2: Overview of the study design and distribution of subjects by dose and study parts   
The subjects received either an IV infusion of pro-netupitant (together with the oral placebo capsule), 
or the oral netupitant 300 mg/palonosetron 0.5 mg FDC capsule (together with the IV placebo 
infusion). The duration of the infusion was 30 min for all dose cohorts. Crossover administrations in the 
same subject were separated by a washout phase of at least 4 weeks. 
During the study, 20 blood samples (5 mL) for the analysis of pro-netupitant, netupitant and its 3 main 
metabolites (M1, M2, M3) were taken at the following times: at predose, tmid [15 min after start of 
infusion (a.s.i)], tend (30 min a.s.i), and 40 min, 50 min, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 
96 and 120 h a.s.i. 
PK parameters 
Pro-netupitant was rapidly converted into netupitant after IV administration, resulting in a limited 
systemic exposure to the pro-drug and a short elimination half-life. The apparent terminal elimination

half-life of pro-netupitant ranged from 0.05 h to 1.24 h in the dosing interval from 32.5 mg to 390 mg. 
At 260 mg, the mean half-life was 0.956 h. 
Peak netupitant concentrations were observed at the end of infusion for all dose levels. The elimination 
of netupitant was slow with a mean apparent terminal elimination half-life ranging from 35 h to 55 h 
for all doses. The mean half-life for the 260 mg dose was 36.1 h. 
Netupitant metabolites were detected early within 1 h from start of pro-netupitant infusion. All 3 
metabolites were eliminated slowly and M1 showed a longer elimination half-life (mean t1/2 ~58 h to 
194 h) compared to M2 (mean t/2 ~6h to 7 h) and M3 (mean t1/2 ~32 h to 69 h). 
Comparison of main PK parameters of netupitant and metabolites after 260 mg IV pro-netupitant and 
300 mg oral netupitant 
The exposure to netupitant after IV administration of 260 mg pro-netupitant (mean AUC0-last of 
12014 h∙μg/L and mean AUC0-inf of 13854 h∙μg/L) was comparable to the mean systemic exposure to 
netupitant after oral administration of 300 mg netupitant (mean AUC0-last of 11317 h∙μg/L and mean 
AUC0-inf of 13899 h∙μg/L). Cmax for netupitant after 260 mg IV fosnetupitant (840.8 µg/L) was ~1.76 
times the Cmax after 300 mg oral netupitant (477.3 µg/L). The mean elimination half-life for 
netupitant after 260 mg IV fosnetupitant (36.1 h) was ~1.65 times shorter than the half-life after 
300 mg oral netupitant (51.6 h). 
After IV administration of 260 mg pro-netupitant, the mean exposure to M1 was lower (mean 
AUC0-last of 2326 h∙μg/L and mean AUC0-inf of 4070 h∙μg/L) compared to the mean M1 exposure 
after oral administration of 300 mg netupitant (mean AUC0-last of 3057 h∙μg/L and mean AUC0-inf of 
4819 h∙μg/L). The exposure to M2 after oral administration of 300 mg netupitant (mean AUC0-last of 
2640 h∙μg/L and mean AUC0-inf of 2993 h∙μg/L) was comparable to the exposure to M2 after IV 
administration of 260 mg pro-netupitant (mean AUC0-last of 2583 h∙μg/L and mean AUC0-inf of 2935 
h∙μg/L). The exposure to M3 after IV administration of 260 mg pro-netupitant (mean AUC0-last of 
3454 h∙μg/L and mean AUC0-inf of 4313 h∙μg/L) was slightly lower than the exposure to M3 after oral 
administration of 300 mg netupitant (mean AUC0-last of 3783 h∙μg/L and mean AUC0-inf of 4620 
h∙μg/L). 
Relative availability

Based on the primary analysis estimate for Frel,IV of 1.17 (95% CI 1.09, 1.24), an IV dose of 257 mg 
(90% CI 243.7, 271.2 mg) pro-netupitant (rounded to 260 mg) is equivalent to the oral 300 mg 
netupitant dose. 
Distribution 
After a single 260mg 30-min IV infusion of fosnetupitant single agent, mean volume of distribution [Vz 
(%CV)] for fosnetupitant in healthy subjects was 124.2 L (60.94%) (Study PNET-12-23, n=30). After a 
single 30-min intravenous infusion of 260mg fosnetupitant/0.25mg palonosetron FDC, mean Vz (%CV) 
for fosnetupitant and palonosetron FDC in cancer patients were 295.79 L (180.73%) and 593.89 L 
(40.21%), respectively (Study NEPA-15-19, n=24). 
Fosnetupitant plasma protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis. For fosnetupitant, the 
overall mean % bound was 93.5% (Study PNET-15-90). 
Elimination 
Terminal half-life (t1/2) 
After a single 30-min intravenous infusion of 260mg fosnetupitant alone in HVs (Study PNET-12-23) or 
in combination with 0.25mg palonosetron in cancer patients (Study NEPA-15-19), the mean t1/2 
(CV%) values for fosnetupitant, netupitant, metabolites M1, M2, M3 and palonosetron (patients only) 
are provided in the table below.   
Table 3: PK parameters for fosnetupitant, netupitant, metabolites M1, M2, M3 and palonosetron 
The longer netupitant and metabolite t1/2 observed in cancer patients compared to healthy subjects is 
attributed to the different time intervals in which the half-life values were assessed in these studies.  
Clearance (CL) 
After a single 30-min IV infusion of 260mg fosnetupitant alone in HVs (Study PNET-12-23) or in 
combination with 0.25mg palonosetron in cancer patients (Study NEPA-15-19), the mean CL (CV%) 
values for fosnetupitant and palonosetron (patients only) are provided in the table below.

The higher clearance of fosnetupitant in cancer patients compared to healthy subjects suggests faster

Metabolism and excretion 
The primary elimination route for fosnetupitant is metabolism. Fosnetupitant is rapidly and completely 
hydrolysed to netupitant by non-CYP450 hydrolytic enzymes. Netupitant is then primarily eliminated by 
CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, giving rise to secondary metabolites M1 (desmethylnetupitant), M2 
(netupitant-N-oxide), and M3 (OH-methyl-netupitant). Renal clearance accounts for less than 5% of 
total clearance. After oral administration of radiolabeled netupitant, 86.5% of administered 
radioactivity was excreted via the faeces in 30 days post-dose.  
The primary elimination route for palonosetron is via the kidneys. After a single intravenous dose of 
radiolabeled palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the 
urine, with unchanged palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. 
Dose proportionality 
In healthy subjects (study PNET-12-23), dose-normalized mean Cmax values and AUC0-inf for 
fosnetupitant were similar for all dose levels. Dose-normalized mean Cmax values for netupitant were 
similar for all dose levels, while dose-normalized mean AUC0-inf values of netupitant were variable and 
slightly supra-proportional with dose increase.

Inter-individual variability 
In healthy subjects (study PNET-12-23), inter-individual PK parameter variability was low for 
fosnetupitant, with CV% for Cmax and AUC parameters <25%. Inter-individual variability for 
netupitant was also reasonably low, with CV% for Cmax and AUC parameters between 14 and 36%. 
In cancer patients (study PNET-15-19), inter-individual PK parameter variability was moderate for 
fosnetupitant, with CV% for Cmax and AUC parameters around 45%. Inter-individual variability for 
netupitant was reasonably low, with CV% for Cmax and AUC parameters between 23 and 28%. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study NEPA-15-19 was a Phase 1, open label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety 
of IV fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) fixed-dose combination administered for the 
prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients receiving a single cycle of 
highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). 
Study patients received a 30-min IV infusion of IV NEPA FCD (260 mg/ 0.25mg) on Day 1, together 
with 12 mg oral dexamethasone, before the start of HEC. Oral dexamethasone 8 mg/day was also 
administered on Days 2 to 4, immediately after PK sampling.

PK samplings were to be performed on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9. Post-dose PK samplings were 
scheduled at 30 min (tend), 45 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 144 h, 
and 192 h after the start of IV NEPA FDC infusion. 
PK profiles of fosnetupitant, netupitant, netupitant metabolites M1, M2 and M3, and palonosetron 
Fosnetupitant exposure in cancer patients was lower than in healthy volunteers after IV administration 
of 260 mg fosnetupitant (PNET-12-23), as indicated by the fosnetupitant Cmax [3478.33 (1558.23) 
ng/mL in patients vs. 6431 (911) ng/mL in healthy subjects] and fosnetupitant AUC∞ [1400.98 
(649.04) h*ng/mL in patients vs. 2938 (362) h*ng/mL in healthy subjects]. This suggests faster 
fosnetupitant biotransformation to netupitant in patients as compared to healthy subjects, a conclusion 
supported by higher fosnetupitant systemic clearance in patients [249.08 (269.74) L/h vs. 90.1 (13.3) 
L/h in healthy volunteers] and comparable netupitant exposures (AUC∞) in patients [15588.49 
(5022.77) h*ng/mL] and healthy subjects [13854 (2957) h*ng/mL] after 260 mg IV fosnetupitant. 
Mean (SD) netupitant exposure (AUC∞) in patients after IV fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 
mg) fixed-dose combination was 15588.49 (5022.77) h*ng/mL, similar to mean (SD) AUC∞ reported 
in healthy volunteers after a single 260 mg IV fosnetupitant infusion [13854 (2957) h*ng/mL] (study 
PNET-12-23). In addition, exposure was similar to that observed in healthy volunteers after oral 
administration of 300 mg netupitant [13899 (5549) h*ng/mL] (study PNET-12-23). This indicates that 
in patients, as well as healthy volunteers, a 260 mg IV fosnetupitant dose is comparable to a 300 mg 
netupitant oral dose. 
The mean (SD) netupitant half-life value estimated in this study of 143.7 (72.6) h, was longer than 
that reported in study PNET-12-23 both after IV fosnetupitant 260 mg [36.1 (6.8) h] and oral 
netupitant 300 mg [51.6 (30.9) h]. This is attributed to the different time intervals in which the half-
life values were assessed (i.e., up to 192 h in the present study NEPA-15-19 and only up to 120 h from 
administration in study PNET-12-23). 
The PK profiles of netupitant metabolites M1, M2 and M3 in patients following the administration of IV 
fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) fixed-dose combination and in healthy subjects after IV 
administration of 260 mg fosnetupitant (study PNET-12-23) were comparable.  
Maximum palonosetron concentrations were observed at the end of infusion (median tmax: 0.58 h). All 
PK parameters were superimposable to those observed in a previous PK study in healthy subjects in 
which a 0.25 mg palonosetron dose was administered as an IV bolus (Study PALO-03-05) [mean (SD) 
AUC∞ 36066 (10727) h*ng/mL and 34800 (11500) h*ng/mL, respectively]. The only exception was 
Cmax which was lower in this study after 30-min infusion, 823.00 (288.69) ng/mL, as compared to 
that observed after the IV bolus, 2060 (1260) ng/mL. 
Special populations 
PK information concerning intrinsic factors was primarily derived from data generated during the oral 
Akynzeo® program. 
• 
Impaired renal and hepatic function 
No studies were performed specifically with fosnetupitant in patients with renal impairment or in 
patients with liver impairment. However, due to the transient exposure of fosnetupitant and 
subsequent conversion to netupitant, there are no additional warnings considered necessary with the 
administration of the prodrug compared to the parent compound. 
•  Gender 
The impact of gender on the PK of fosnetupitant, netupitant and its metabolites, and palonosetron was 
studied. After IV administration of 260 mg fosnetupitant in healthy volunteers (Study PNET-12-23), no

clear impact of gender was observed on the main PK parameters for pro-netupitant, netupitant and its 
metabolites. In cancer patients (Study NEPA-15-19), the PK profiles of pro-netupitant, netupitant and 
its metabolites, and palonosetron were reasonably similar overall between males and females after IV 
administration of fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) fixed-dose combination. A marginal 
impact of gender on fosnetupitant and netupitant metabolites PK was observed, with females showing 
slightly higher exposures. 
Interactions 
• 
In vitro 
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed moderate to weak inhibition properties of 
fosnetupitant towards in particular CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (Study PNET-15-49). Also, fosnetupitant 
weakly inhibited the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated substrate accumulation in HEK293 cells stably 
expressing the respective transporters in a dose-dependent manner. Fosnetupitant weakly inhibited 
the MDR1-mediated probe substrate accumulation in a vesicular transport assay performed with inside-
out membrane vesicles prepared from cells overexpressing MDR-1 (Study PNET-15-27). 
• 
In silico 
Study PNET-16-29 was an in silico PBPK study, using the Simcyp Population-Based Simulator (Version 
15),  to evaluate the likely impact of co-administration of pro-netupitant (260 mg) on the exposure 
(Cmax and AUC) of a CYP2C9 substrate (S-warfarin), a CYP2C19 substrate (omeprazole), an OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3 substrate (rosuvastatin) and a P-gp substrate (digoxin). 
A minimal PBPK model with a single adjusting compartment was selected over other models based on 
the optimal comparison between observed and model predicted plasma concentration-time profiles of 
pro-netupitant following an IV infusion of 260 mg pro-netupitant administered over 30 minutes (Figure 
2).

For simulation of plasma concentration-time profiles of pro-netupitant, data from the 17 healthy adult 
subjects recruited into clinical study PNET-13-63 were used.  
In vitro Ki values were used in the model to assess the potential of pro-netupitant as a perpetrator of 
drug-drug interactions with relevant probe substrates. This involved generating 10 virtual trials of 17 
subjects receiving an IV infusion of 260 mg pro-netupitant co-administered with one of the following 
compounds: 
a)  A single dose oral dose of 20 mg omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) 
b)  A single oral dose of 10 mg S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) 
c)  A single oral dose of 20 mg rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate) 
d)  A single oral dose of 0.5 mg digoxin (P-gp substrate) 
Simulations were run using the relevant library file for the compound (substrate) within the Simcyp 
Population-Based Simulator (Version 15). For each compound, sensitivity analyses were performed to 
assess the impact of a range of Ki values (10-fold lower than the measured in vitro value) and hepatic 
uptake values (1 to 10) on the magnitude of interaction. 
Impact of co-administration of pro-netupitant (260 mg) on the exposure of probe substrates 
The analysis indicated that, based on in vitro Ki estimates for pro-netupitant, there is likely to be 
negligible interaction between pro-netupitant and CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates and OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3 and P-gp substrates. 
Prediction of the magnitude of interaction with omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) indicated no increase 
in omeprazole exposure, with predicted geometric mean Cmax and AUC ratios of 1.00 and 1.00, 
respectively. Assuming a CYP2C19 Ki of 2.3 μM (10-fold lower than the in vitro value) and a hepatic

uptake of 10 (a scalar of the unbound concentration in the liver relative to that in plasma) for pro-
netupitant, the predicted AUC ratio was 1.03. 
Prediction of the magnitude of interaction with S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) indicated no increase in 
S-warfarin exposure, with predicted geometric mean Cmax and AUC ratios of 1.00 and 1.00, 
respectively. Assuming a CYP2C9 Ki of 1.4 μM (10-fold lower than the in vitro value) and a hepatic 
uptake of 10 for pro-netupitant, the predicted AUC ratio was 1.03. 
Prediction of the magnitude of interaction with rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate) 
indicated no increase in rosuvastatin exposure, with predicted geometric mean Cmax and AUC ratios of 
1.00 and 1.00, respectively. Assuming an OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 Ki of 0.95 or 0.87 μM (10-fold lower 
than the in vitro values), respectively, and a hepatic uptake of 10 for pro-netupitant, the predicted 
AUC ratios were 1.00 and 1.00, respectively. 
Prediction of the magnitude of interaction with digoxin (P-gp substrate) indicated no significant 
increase in digoxin exposure, with predicted geometric mean Cmax and AUC ratios of 1.04 and 1.01, 
respectively. Assuming a hepatic P-gp Ki of 2.5 μM (10-fold lower than the in vitro value) and a hepatic 
uptake of 10, the AUC ratio for digoxin was 1.01. Assuming an intestinal P-gp Ki of 2.5 μM (10-fold 
lower than the assumed in vitro value) and a hepatic uptake of 10 for pro-netupitant, the AUC ratio 
was 1.04, with an increase in Cmax of 32% (Cmax ratio 1.32) (Figure 21).

In vivo 
Study PNET-13-63 was a randomized three period crossover study in 28 healthy male and female 
volunteers to assess the effects of IV pro-netupitant infused in 30 minutes on the PK of orally 
administered dexamethasone. 
The pro-netupitant or placebo infusion was given on Day 1. Dexamethasone tablets were given daily 
on Days 1 to 4. 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples for determination of dexamethasone were taken at predose, 30 min, 
45 min, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 85, 86, 88, 90, 92, 96, 108 and 120 
hours after start of infusion.

Analysis of primary PK parameters of dexamethasone 
Table 5 mixed model ANOVA results (Day 1 PK parameters). 
Table 6 mixed model ANOVA results (Day 4 PK parameters)  
After administration of dexamethasone alone or with co-administration of IV pro-netupitant, 
dexamethasone exposure was slightly higher in males than in females. The ANOVA model showed no 
statistically significant effect for gender or the gender by treatment interaction on dexamethasone PK. 
Co-administration of single increasing IV pro-netupitant doses (130 mg, 195 mg, and 260 mg) with 
oral dexamethasone resulted in a moderate increase of dexamethasone exposure as compared to the 
exposure achieved after administration of dexamethasone alone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 37/90 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The extent of the interaction proved to depend on pro-netupitant dose size: dexamethasone exposure 
was greater after administration of higher pro-netupitant doses. The interaction lasted up to 4 days 
after pro-netupitant administration. 
The extent of dexamethasone exposure increase with 260 mg IV pronetupitant is similar to the one 
observed when dexamethasone is co-administered with 300 mg oral netupitant (Study NETU-06-07).  
The dexamethasone dose reduction to be applied when co-administering IV pro-netupitant 260 mg is 
the same as of oral Akynzeo®. This means that to warrant a dexamethasone exposure equivalent to 
that yielded by a standard dexamethasone alone regimen (20 mg on Day 1 followed by 8 mg b.i.d. 
from Day 2 to 4), the dexamethasone loading and maintenance doses, when the drug is co-
administered with pro-netupitant, should be respectively reduced to 12 mg (Day 1) and to 8 mg q.d. 
(Days 2 to 4).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No new PD or PK/PD studies were conducted for the IV NEPA FDC program. 
Three studies were performed to evaluate the PK and PD effects of netupitant during the oral program 
development, including an apomorphine challenge study (study NP16602), a NK1 receptor occupancy 
PET study (study NETU-06-08) and a thorough QT/QTc study (study NETU-07-20). In addition, 
relationships for cardiac safety and efficacy measures were graphically explored (study NETU-10-02).

Mechanism of action 
Netupitant is a selective antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Delayed 
emesis has been associated with the activation of tachykinin family neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors 
(broadly distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems) by substance P. As shown in in 
vitro and in vivo studies, netupitant inhibits substance P mediated responses.  
Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or 
no affinity for other receptors. Chemotherapeutic substances produce nausea and vomiting by 
stimulating the release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. Serotonin 
then activates 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. 
Primary pharmacology 
Results of a positron emission tomography (PET) study, conducted during the oral programme, 
demonstrated that netupitant is a potent selective NK1 receptor antagonist with continued receptor 
occupation duration suitable to cover the 120-hour period in chemotherapy induced nausea and 
vomiting. Based on the PK/PD model, a netupitant plasma concentration of 225 μg/L corresponded to 
NK1 receptor occupancy (RO) of 90% in striatum. 
When model parameters were applied to predict the time course of netupitant RO after IV 
administration of 260 mg fosnetupitant, the temporal profiles of NK1 occupancy in the different brain 
regions overlapped those simulated after oral administration of 300 mg netupitant.  
Figure 7 temporal profiles of NK1 occupancy in the different brain regions vs those simulated after oral 
administration of 300 mg netupitant   
Secondary pharmacology 
A thorough QT study was completed with the oral FDC and demonstrated that the combination of 
netupitant and palonosetron was safe, well tolerated and had no clinically important effects on heart 
rate, PR and QRS interval duration, on cardiac morphology or cardiac repolarization when administered 
in male and female healthy volunteers. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In an apomorphine challenge study, conducted during the oral programme, netupitant appeared to 
reduce the incidence of emetic episodes in a concentration-dependent manner. No vomiting was

observed for any subject at netupitant plasma concentrations above 300 ng/mL (450 mg in 5 patients 
and 300 mg in 1 patient). Subjects with lower netupitant concentrations also experienced less vomiting 
(50%) than the placebo group (75%). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This is an application for an extension to the existing oral Akynzeo Marketing Authorisation to include 
IV NEPA FDC, an intravenous fixed dose combination of fosnetupitant (or pro-netupitant) and 
palonosetron. Fosnetupitant is a water soluble phosphorylated pro-drug of netupitant rapidly converted 
to netupitant in vivo following IV administration. 
The clinical pharmacology program for the IV NEPA FDC included one safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) 
dose escalation study (PNET-12-23) and two additional studies; a PK study in cancer patients following 
administration of the proposed commercial IV NEPA FDC (NEPA-15-19), and a drug-drug interaction 
study with dexamethasone conducted with fosnetupitant only (PNET-13-63). 
An in silico physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling study was also conducted to 
predict the in vivo impact of fosnetupitant interactions with CYP isoforms and efflux/uptake 
transporters observed in vitro on the PK profile of relevant drug substrates (PNET-16-29). 
Study PNET-12-23 was a dose escalation study in healthy subjects assessing the safety of IV pro-
netupitant from 19.5 to 390 mg, combined with crossover study extensions with oral Akynzeo to 
estimate the dose of IV pro-netupitant yielding a netupitant exposure equivalent to that provided by 
300 mg oral netupitant (target dose of oral netupitant component within the combination). 
The design and methodology of the study is considered acceptable from a PK perspective.  
Pro-netupitant was shown to be rapidly converted to netupitant after IV administration. Peak 
netupitant concentrations were observed at the end of the 30-minute infusion for all dose levels. 
The pharmacokinetic objective of major interest was the estimation of the relative availability factor 
(Frel,IV) for netupitant when given in form of IV pro-netupitant in comparison to the oral netupitant 
300 mg/palonosetron 0.5 mg FDC. The primary target value to estimate exposure was the AUC0-inf 
based on plasma concentrations of netupitant. 
A relative availability factor of 1.17 (95%CI 1.09, 1.24) for netupitant, based on dose-normalised 
AUC0-inf ANOVA estimates after IV pro-netupitant and oral netupitant administration, was observed 
when all crossover dose cohorts were considered. An IV pro-netupitant dose of 257 mg (rounded to 
260 mg) was therefore identified as the dose that yields a netupitant exposure equivalent to that 
provided by a 300 mg dose of oral netupitant. 
As there was some concern of reduced efficacy in the delayed phase (see Clinical Section), the 
applicant provided 90% CIs for the ratio of the geometric means for AUC0-24h, AUC24-120h, and 
Cmin at 120 hrs of netupitant for 260 mg IV pro-netupitant vs 300 mg oral netupitant. The results 
demonstrated bioequivalence between IV pro-netupitant and oral netupitant for these time intervals. 
The results also showed slightly lower exposure to netupitant metabolites for the proposed IV pro-
netupitant dose of 260 mg compared to the oral netupitant 300 mg dose. Therefore, the applicant 
provided 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric means for AUC0-inf, AUC0-last and Cmax of netupitant 
metabolites (M1, M2, and M3) for 260 mg IV pro-netupitant vs 300 mg oral netupitant. These showed 
slightly higher exposures to netupitant metabolites following oral netupitant vs IV fosnetupitant. It was 
shown that this difference in metabolite exposures was  unlikely to have a clinically relevant impact on 
drug safety and efficacy.

Study NEPA-15-19 was a dense sampling PK study with IV NEPA FDC (260 mg fosnetupitant/0.25 mg 
palonosetron) to characterize the PK profile of unchanged fosnetupitant, netupitant and its metabolites 
M1, M2 and M3, and palonosetron in cancer patients. 24 adult cancer patients receiving highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy received a single administration of IV NEPA FDC infused over 30 minutes, 
together with oral dexamethasone. The design and methodology of this study is considered acceptable 
from a PK perspective. 
Fosnetupitant exposure in cancer patients appeared to be lower than in healthy volunteers, suggesting 
faster fosnetupitant biotransformation to netupitant in patients as compared to healthy subjects. This 
is supported by the higher fosnetupitant clearance observed in patients but comparable netupitant 
exposures in patients and healthy subjects. 
Netupitant exposure in cancer patients after 260 mg IV fosnetupitant administration was shown to be 
similar to that reported in healthy volunteers after a single 260 mg IV fosnetupitant infusion and to 
that observed in healthy volunteers after oral administration of 300 mg netupitant (study PNET-12-
23). This supports previous evidence showing that a 260 mg IV fosnetupitant dose yields a netupitant 
exposure comparable to that of a 300 mg netupitant oral dose.  
Palonosetron PK profile was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects in which a 0.25 mg 
palonosetron dose was administered as an IV bolus (study PALO-03-05), with the exception of Cmax 
which was lower after 30-min infusion (823 ng/mL) as compared to the IV bolus (2060 ng/mL).  
Study PNET-13-63 assessed the effects of IV pro-netupitant infused in 30 minutes at 3 different 
dosages on the PK of orally administered dexamethasone (20 mg on Day 1 followed by 8 mg b.i.d. on 
Days 2, 3, and 4) in healthy male and female subjects. 
A mixed model ANOVA, with fixed factors for period and treatment and a random factor for subject, 
was applied to dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters of dexamethasone given alone and co-
administered with different doses of pro-netupitant, to assess the effect of pro-netupitant on 
dexamethasone PK. Furthermore, the gender by treatment interaction was tested using an ANOVA 
model with the additional fixed factors for gender as well as the gender by treatment interaction. 
The design and methodology of this study is considered acceptable and the applicant’s conclusions are 
supported. 
This study demonstrated that co-administration of pro-netupitant and dexamethasone increases 
dexamethasone exposure in a dose dependent manner. Drug-drug interaction occurred on Day 1 and 
lasted at least until Day 4. The results indicate a need for dose adjustment of dexamethasone when it 
is co-administered with pro-netupitant. 
On Day 1, at the dose of 260 mg pro-netupitant, dexamethasone AUC and Cmin increased 
approximately of 1.5- and 5.2-folds, respectively, as compared to the parameter values observed with 
dexamethasone given alone. On Day 4, at the dose of 260 mg pro-netupitant, the point estimates of 
treatment comparisons for dose-normalized dexamethasone AUC and Cmin increased approximately of 
2.5 and 3.2 folds, respectively, as compared to the parameter values observed with dexamethasone 
given alone. 
It is agreed that the extent of dexamethasone exposure increase with 260 mg IV pro-netupitant, the 
recommended pro-netupitant dose for Phase 3 studies and intended for registration, is similar to the 
one observed when dexamethasone is co-administered with 300 mg oral netupitant (Study NETU-06-
07). 
Study PNET-16-29 was an in silico PBPK study to evaluate drug-drug interactions with pro-netupitant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020

The PBPK model, based on in vitro and in vivo data for pro-netupitant, was developed to simulate 
plasma concentration-time profiles and exposure levels of pro-netupitant after a single IV dose of 
260 mg infused over 30 minutes. In vitro Ki values were then used to assess the potential of pro-
netupitant as a perpetrator of drug-drug interactions with relevant probe substrates: omeprazole 
(CYP2C19 substrate), S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate), 
and digoxin (P-gp substrate). 
Due to the uncertainty of in vitro Ki values, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of 
reducing in vitro Ki values for pro-netupitant by 10-fold. In addition, hepatic uptake was increased 
from 1 to 10 (representing the worst case scenario), to assess the effect on the predicted magnitude of 
the interaction. 
The results indicated that an interaction between pro-netupitant and CYP2C9, CYP2C19, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, and P-gp substrates is unlikely.  
Currently, PBPK modelling and simulation is acceptable by EU Regulators for predicting either lack of 
enzyme inhibition (presently, fosnetupitant on CYP2C9 or CYP2C19) by a perpetrator (source: EMA 
Guidelines on DDI investigations and Guideline on the qualification and reporting of PBPK modelling 
and simulation) or enzyme inhibition by a moderate inhibitor when data with a strong one are known, 
and not acceptable for transporter-mediated interactions. Therefore, the Applicant applied the basic 
method for predicting potential clinically relevant DDI with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates by using 
the formulation proposed for R value calculation stemming from the “FDA Draft Guidance for Industry 
In Vitro Metabolism- and Transporter Mediated Drug-Drug Interaction Studies, CDER, October 2017 – 
Clinical Pharmacology “. The results indicated that in vivo interactions between fosnetupitant and 
substrates of OATP1B1/3 transporters are unlikely. 
The PBPK model was not adequate for CYP2C19 as only 2 omeprazole studies were provided to qualify 
the model. Therefore, the applicant focused the in silico DDI evaluation between fosnetupitant and 
CYP2C substrates mainly on CYP2C9, and then extrapolated results from CYP2C9 to CYP2C19. The 
analysis indicated that, based on in vitro Ki estimates for fosnetupitant, interaction between 
fosnetupitant and CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates is unlikely of clinical relevance. 
Several studies were performed to evaluate the PK/PD effects of netupitant for the original MAA for 
oral Akynzeo. These included an apomorphine challenge study, a NK1 receptor occupancy PET study 
and a thorough QT/QTc study. In addition, relationships for cardiac safety and efficacy measures were 
explored graphically. 
No new PD or PK/PD studies were conducted in the clinical pharmacology program for the IV NEPA 
FDC, which is acceptable. Simulations support the similarity of the netupitant interaction kinetics with 
NK1 receptors following administration of 260 mg IV fosnetupitant and 300 mg oral netupitant. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of fosnetupitant, netupitant, M1, M2, M3, and palonosetron were studied and characterised for 
this application. An IV dose of 260 mg was demonstrated to yield a netupitant exposure equivalent to 
that provided by a 300 mg dose of oral netupitant 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation: 
• 
The MAH will perform an in vitro study assessing the ability of fosnetupitant to inhibit all UGTs 
of interest (i.e. UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, and 2B7.

2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
The applicant has submitted 2 Phase 3 clinical efficacy studies (PALO-15017 & NEPA-15-18) however 
neither would be considered pivotal but more supportive along with bioequivalence study, PNET-12-23 
for efficacy PK bridging.  
The 2 main clinical efficacy studies will be presented under separate subheadings. 
Study number PALO-15-17 
A phase 3, single-dose, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group study to assess the 
efficacy and safety of palonosetron 0.25 mg administered as a 30-minute IV infusion compared to 
palonosetron 0.25 mg administered as a 30-second IV bolus for the prevention of chemotherapy-
induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. 
The objective of the non-inferiority study, PAOL-15-17 was to demonstrate the efficacy of the

Study PALO-15-17 
Study PALO-15017 is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double dummy parallel group, stratified 
study that assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a single-dose of palonosetron 0.25 mg 
administered as a 30-min IV infusion versus a single-dose of palonosetron 0.25 mg administered as a 
30-sec IV bolus, each administered with oral dexamethasone prior to highly emetogenic chemotherapy 
HEC. 
• 
Study participants  
Adult chemotherapy naïve patients (male and female patients) with a diagnosis of malignant solid 
tumour requiring a first treatment with one of the reference HEC regimens. The main characteristics of 
the population selected for this study were similar to those of the PALO-99-05 study, the pivotal 
efficacy trial that supported approval of 30- sec IV bolus of palonosetron 0.25 mg. The administration

of the reference HEC was not to extend beyond 4 h on study Day 1 and patients that were scheduled 
to receive MEC or HEC from Day 2 to Day 5 were excluded. 
A total of 441 patients were randomised, and 440 (99.8%) received study treatment. 225 participants 
were treated with the 30 minute palonosetron infusion IMP and 215 with the 30 second bolus 
palonosetron control. 
• 
Treatments 
Test drug: palonosetron 0.25 mg (as 50 mL solution for IV infusion), was to be administered as a 30-
min (±5) IV infusion on Day 1. The IV infusion was to start 30 min prior to and was to be completed 
before the start of the reference HEC administration. 
Control drug: palonosetron 0.25 mg (as 5 mL solution for IV bolus), was to be administered as a 30-
sec IV bolus on Day 1. The IV bolus was to be administered 30 min before the start of the reference 
HEC administration. 
For blinding purposes, a double-dummy technique was to be applied. Patients were to receive placebos 
for test and control drugs, as applicable. 
The following time windows were defined (as per protocol version 3.0) for the administration of test 
drug (palonosetron IV infusion) and its placebo, and control drug (palonosetron IV bolus) and its 
placebo, on Day 1: 
•  Palonosetron (or placebo) 30-sec IV bolus: to be performed within 5 min from the oral 
dexamethasone administration 
•  Palonosetron (or placebo) 30(±5)-min IV infusion: to be started within 5 min from the 
palonosetron (or placebo) IV bolus administration, between 40-25 min before the start of 
reference chemotherapy administration 
• 
Objectives 
The primary objective: 
to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a single IV dose of palonosetron 0.25 mg administered as a 30-
min IV infusion with oral dexamethasone versus a single IV dose of palonosetron 0.25 mg 
administered as a 30-sec IV bolus with oral dexamethasone, in terms of proportion of patients with 
complete response (CR) in the acute phase (0-24 h after start of reference HEC) of CINV. 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study was to demonstrate a) a CR in the delayed and overall 
phases, b) the proportion of patients with no emetic episodes in the acute, delayed and overall phases 
and c) the proportion of patients with no use of rescue medication in the acute, delayed and overall 
phases. 
The secondary safety objectives were to evaluate the safety of a single dose of palonosetron 0.25 mg 
administered as a 30-min IV infusion with oral dexamethasone for the prevention of HEC-induced 
nausea and vomiting. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR), defined 
as no emetic episodes and no rescue medication, in the acute phase of CINV. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were defined as follows: 
•  The proportion of patients with CR during the delayed and overall phases of CINV

•  The proportion of patients with no emetic episodes during the acute, delayed and overall phases 
of CINV 
•  The proportion of patients with no rescue medication during the acute, delayed and overall

Sample size 
The number of patients to be randomised in the study was planned to be 440, equally distributed in 
the two treatment groups (220 patients/group). Patients were to be randomised according to a 
randomization ratio 1:1, stratified by gender and country. 
The sample size was based on the assumption of a CR rate in the acute (0-24 h) phase of 80% in both 
groups. The non-inferiority margin was set at -15%. For a two-sided test of difference using Type I 
error equal to 0.01, a sample size of 212 evaluable patients per group was needed to ensure 90% 
power (nQuery + nTerim 3.0, module PTEO-1). The sample size was increased to 220 per group, to 
ensure an adequate number of evaluable patients. 
No interim analysis was planned for this study. 
• 
Randomisation 
Patients that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomised into one of the two 
treatment arms, in a balanced design (1:1) according to specific procedures using the IWRS.  
Treatment assignment was managed through a static central blocked randomisation stratified by 
gender (male, female) and country. The randomisation scheme was meant to be reproducible and 
prepared prior to study start via a computerized system by the IWRS vendor. A master randomisation 
copy was to be filed securely by this vendor and the Sponsor in a manner that ensured the blind was 
properly maintained throughout the trial. The biostatistician involved in the creation of the 
randomisation lists did not take part in the study activities.

• 
Blinding (masking) 
The blinding of the study medications was guaranteed by the use of identical placebos to the 
respective active drugs (double-dummy technique). When palonosetron 0.25 mg was to be 
administered as 30-min IV infusion, a 30-sec IV bolus of placebo was to be administered (Group 1). 
Conversely, when palonosetron 0.25 mg was administered as a 30-sec IV bolus, a 30-min infusion of 
placebo was to be administered (Group 2). Therefore, each patient was to receive a 30-sec IV bolus 
and a 30-min IV infusion, one of which contained the active IMP while the other was a placebo. 
No blinding was required for dexamethasone, which was administered at the same dose and posology 
in both treatment groups. 
Due to the blinded study design, neither the Sponsor, nor the pharmacist, the Investigator, the 
patient, or the CRO knew which treatment was administered. The monitor who checked the drug 
accountability forms was also blinded with regard to the treatment administered. The Investigator had 
the possibility to unblind the study treatment in case of an emergency situation, when he/she 
considered it essential to know what treatments the patient had received. The IWRS was to promptly 
notify, in a blinded fashion, the Sponsor and the Clinical Monitor when a treatment code had been 
unblinded by the Investigator. 
• 
Statistical methods 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomised patients who received the HEC regimen and active 
study drug (including partial infusion). Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were assigned to 
the treatment group to which they were randomised. The FAS was used for demography, other 
baseline characteristics and all efficacy analyses. 
The per protocol (PP) Population included all patients from the FAS who completed the 0-24 h study 
period with no major protocol violations, i.e., those believed to potentially affect the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The PP Population was used for demography, other baseline characteristics, and for the 
primary efficacy analysis. 
All protocol violations (e.g., wrong inclusion, poor compliance, missing diaries, forbidden concomitant 
medications and mis-randomisations) were to be reviewed and discussed case by case during the blind 
data review meeting and decisions were to be described in the blind data review document/minutes 
which were to be finalized prior to database lock. 
A blind data review meeting including but not limited to the definition of analysis populations was held 
on the 6th & 7th Jun 2016.  
No interim analysis was planned for this study. 
The approach followed for this non-inferiority study was the fixed-margin method. Taking into account 
that the current study was to address a change in the duration of infusion (from 30-sec bolus to 30-
min infusion) for a widely used treatment approved for HEC CINV, the proposed non-inferiority margin 
of 15% was considered adequate and conservative by the applicant. 
Regarding multiplicity, there was one single primary endpoint for confirmatory analysis. Since all the 
secondary efficacy endpoints in the acute phase of CINV were intended to provide supportive evidence 
related to the primary objective only and in the delayed and overall phases of CINV were intended to 
provide additional clinical characterization of treatment effect, no adjustment for multiplicity was 
planned and results were interpreted in a descriptive manner only. 
Three phases were defined for the efficacy evaluation. The acute phase of CINV was to start at ‘time 
0’, which was the start of the reference HEC administration and last for the first 24 h. The delayed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 46/90 
 
 
 
phase of CINV was to start at >24 h after the start of reference HEC administration until 120 h. The 
overall phase of CINV was to start from time 0 till 120 h after the start of HEC administration. 
Due to the short observation period (24 h for the primary efficacy endpoint and a maximum of 120 h 
for all the other efficacy assessments) and based on a previous Sponsor’s studies with a very similar 
design and in the same setting (HEC), a very low number of dropouts and minimal missing data was 
expected. 
Any patients who did not provide data about occurrence of emetic episodes and rescue medication 
intake or did not provide a full set of these data throughout the 24 h after HEC administration were to 
be considered as treatment failures (i.e., non-responders) for the primary efficacy analysis. A patient 
was to be considered as having CR only if there was documented evidence of both no occurrence of 
emetic episodes and no rescue medication intake. Otherwise the patient was to be considered a failure. 
The percentage of responders was to be calculated using the FAS population as denominator. 
Gender and country were identified as the factors expected to influence the primary efficacy endpoint. 
These factors were to be taken into consideration for randomisation and for the analyses however 
treatment by gender and country interactions was to be explored but not included in the primary 
analysis model. In case significant interactions (i.e., p-value ≤0.100) were found, additional 
investigational analyses could have been run in order to understand the reason for the heterogeneity. 
A logistic regression model was to be used to investigate the interactions between treatment and 
stratification factors (gender or country). The Chi-square Wald test was to be used to test the 
significance of the interaction terms. 
Non-significance of interaction terms between treatment and factor would indicate that these data do 
not suggest any evidence that the treatment affects the response differently in each of the type 
presented by that variable. In case of significant interactions (i.e: p-value ≤0.100), further 
investigation were to be conducted to understand the reason of heterogeneity. 
There was one change to the planned analyses that the applicant regarded as minor; the calculation of 
non-stratified (crude) risk difference and relative 95% CI according to Newcombe-Wilson method was 
added to the efficacy endpoints. This was implemented in the final SAP version 5.1 dated 13th June 
2016.  
Study NEPA-15-18  
A phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active control study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of IV pro-netupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) combination for the prevention of 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in repeated chemotherapy cycles in patients receiving 
highly emetogenic chemotherapy. 
•  Study participants & Treatments 
The study participants consisted of female and male adult patients that were chemotherapy-naїve with 
a diagnosis of malignant solid tumour. Each participant was recruited if they required treatment for at 
least 4 cycles with the pre-defined reference HEC (mainly cisplatin) to be administered on Day 1 of 
each chemotherapy cycle. Participants were excluded if they were scheduled to receive MEC or HEC 
from day 2 to Day 5 of the cycle or had a poor performance status (ECOG > 2). 
The control drug, oral netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.50 mg) FDC and the test drug, intravenous 
30minute infusion fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) FDC were administered on Day 1 of 
each cycle (60 minutes and 30 minutes respectively) prior to the start of the chemotherapy. The 30-
min IV infusion was to be completed before starting chemotherapy administration. 
For blinding purposes, the double-dummy technique was applied. Patients were to be administered 
with placebos for test and control treatments, as applicable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 47/90 
 
 
 
The selection of doses for the IV infusion are based on the approved IV bolus dose of palonosetron and 
the results of the PK study in healthy volunteers PNET-12-23 that was discussed in the clinical 
pharmacology section above. 
•  Objectives 
Safety and tolerability are the primary objectives of the trial. The secondary objective of this study 
was to describe the efficacy of a single dose of IV NEPA FDC (260 mg/0.25 mg) infused over 30 min 
with oral dexamethasone during the acute (0-24 h), delayed (>24-120 h) and overall (0-120 h) 
phases of initial and repeated cycles of HEC (4 cycles in total). 
In contrast to the non-inferiority study PALO-15-17, efficacy endpoints are defined as CR (no emetic 
episodes and no rescue medication) during the acute & delayed phases but also the overall phase as 
an endpoint. Nausea assessment has also been described using the visual analogue scale (VAS).  
All patients were to be asked to document in a patient diary details of their emetic episodes during the 
120 h following the start of chemotherapy cycle. These details included: 
• 
Each episode of retching or vomiting 
•  Date of each retching or vomiting episode 
• 
Exact time of onset of each retching or vomiting episode 
Each emetic episode, as well as date and start time of occurrence was to be documented on the eCRF 
in accordance with the patient diary records. 
•  Statistical methods 
The assessment and description of efficacy was a secondary objective of the study. Only descriptive 
statistics were planned for the efficacy endpoints. All efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS. In 
contrast to the non-inferiority study PALO-15-17, there was no per protocol (PP) set analysis.  
At each cycle, for each phase (acute, delayed, and overall), numbers and percentages (including 95% 
confidence interval [CI] using the Wilson score method) of patients with CR, with no emetic episodes, 
with no rescue medications, and with no significant nausea were summarized by treatment and by 
treatment and gender. 
Differences between groups in response rate and 95% CI for difference were analysed using 
Newcombe-Wilson’s method and also the stratum-adjusted Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) method 
for the risk difference. Gender and country were used as strata. 
Results were interpreted only in a descriptive manner. 
Since nausea intensity was assessed daily by VAS, for the endpoint referred to “patients with no 
significant nausea” in the delayed and overall phases, the maximum VAS value in the relevant phase 
was considered (i.e., the maximum VAS value for Day 2 to 5 for delayed phase and for Day 1 to 5 for 
the overall phase). Data collected on the patient diaries were also listed, as well as the calculated 
variable for CR. The recorded emetic episodes were also listed by treatment group. 
The efficacy analyses were performed for the full analysis set (FAS) for both PALO-15-17 and NEPA 15-
18. In the non-inferiority study PALO-15-17, primary efficacy analysis was also performed on the Per 
Protocol (PP) population. For this development program, the FAS population included patients who 
were randomised, received the reference chemotherapy regimen and study drug.

Major protocol deviations are summarized in Table 4 of the study report. All patients with major 
protocol deviations were excluded from the PP Population, as previously described in statistical 
methods. 
There were major protocol deviations in 15 (3.4%) patients in the FAS: 11 (4.9%) in the infusion 
group and 4 (1.9%) in the bolus group. The most common major protocol deviation (affecting 9 
[2.0%] patients) referred to “dexamethasone not administered within the time window on the morning 
of Day 2”. All remaining major protocol deviations either referred to an HEC dosage outside of the 
reference range (3 [0.7%] patients) or to the use of medication with potential anti-emetic effects 
within 24 h after starting the reference HEC (3 [0.7%] patients). 
•  Baseline data 
The safety population was comprised 295 (67.0%) male patients and 145 (33.0%) female patients, 
equally distributed between treatment groups (gender was a stratification factor).  
In terms of race, all (100%) patients in the Safety Population were Caucasian (white). 
The applicant also presented other demographics ECOG status, smoker, alcohol consumption, medical 
& cancer history, priori and concomitant medication and reference chemotherapy.  
An overview of all randomized patients by gender and country is shown below. The greatest proportion 
of patients were enrolled in the Russian Federation (30.4%), followed by Hungary (22.2%), Romania 
(20.6%), and the Republic of Georgia (9.5%). Gender is balanced in both arms but more males (67% 
versus 33%) were enrolled into the study compared to females.

The FAS included 440 (99.8%) patients who were treated with the study drug and received HEC (225 
[100%] patients in the infusion group, and 215 [99.5%] in the bolus group). The PP Population 
included 425 (96.4%) patients (214 [95.1%] patients in the infusion group and 211 [97.7%] patients 
in the bolus group).  
A total of 16 (3.6%) randomized patients was excluded from the PP Population due to major protocol 
violations: 11 (4.9%) patients in the infusion group and 4 (1.9%) patients in the bolus group; in 
addition, one patient in the bolus group was not treated and was, therefore, excluded from the FAS.

Treatment by factor interaction was tested only in the efficacy study (PALO-15-17). No treatment-by-
gender or treatment-by-country interactions were detected although the study may not have been 
sufficiently powered to detect such differences. 
All subgroup analyses were exploratory and results need to be interpreted with caution due to small 
numbers in some groups.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is for a line extension to the intravenous formulation of the fixed dose combination 
Akynzeo. Therefore, the clinical development programme requires to show that this formulation is 
comparable and bioequivalent to the oral formulation. From an efficacy perspective this has not been 
robustly demonstrated by the applicant in light of the study designs, namely submitting efficacy 
studies that are more supportive in nature and relying mainly on the PK-bridge. The study NEPA-15-18 
was not designed or powered to examine for differences in clinical efficacy between the oral and IV 
administration of fixed dose combination Akynzeo.

An “other concern” was raised in the efficacy assessment regarding the absence a powered efficacy 
study. There were also “other concerns” that required careful consideration by the applicant as they 
highlighted the shortcomings of the efficacy data presented and lack of adherence to the CHMP 
scientific advice received.  
The applicant emphasises that study NEPA-15-18 was aimed to complement the clinical development 
programme of IV NEPA FDC, providing additional safety information as per FDA request in light of the 
higher Cmax of intravenous netupitant observed compared to oral formulation in the bioavailability 
study PNET-12-23. The applicant references the “bioequivalence plus safety approach” that was 
accepted by the CHMP for fosaprepitant assessment. However, CHMP scientific advice in relation to 
Akynzeo emphasised that judging how far PK differences might translate in altered efficacy is the less 
preferred option from a regulatory perspective. 
Regarding study NEPA-15-18, there is little uncertainty that the intravenous formulation is comparable 
to the oral FDC during the acute phase of CINV. The proportion of patients with no emetic episodes, no 
rescue medication or no significant nausea in the acute phase was ≥90% for both treatment groups at 
each cycle. In contrast the response in the delayed phase is not comparable with the worst difference 
seen in cycle 4. 
This difference in results in the delayed phase is relevant in light of the OC raised regarding the shorter 
half-life in study PNET-12-23 and the scientific advice given in 2016 relating to PK bridging from study 
PNET-12-23: 
“From a scientific perspective, there is concern on whether the advantage established for the oral FDC 
over the mono-components can be equally assumed for the IV FDC……tmax and t1/2 are considered 
major determinants of the duration of drug action after dosing; t1/2 of the intravenous formulation 
seems to be shorter and less variable, compared to the capsules. Correspondingly, the maintenance of 
the therapeutic concentration in the plasma might be influenced by a shorter t1/2. This could lead to a 
shortening of the duration of the antiemetic effect. Even if the duration of antiemetic effect of 
netupitant is probably better correlated with interactions at the receptor level than with plasma half-
life, the clinical relevance of the difference in t1/2 remains still unclear and represents an uncertainty 
factor.” 
The applicant provided a justification as to why the intravenous formulation half-life was shorter in 
study PNET-12-23 compared to the oral formulation (exceptionally high individual half-life values but 
similar median half-lives) and that the differences are unlikely to have impacted the delayed efficacy 
effects which is acceptable. The applicant has also provided a justification as to how the lower Cmax 
after the 30min infusion compared to the 10sec bolus does not negatively affect the clinical efficacy of 
study NEPA-15-18 which is acceptable:   
a) Cmax is not primarily related to the antiemetic efficacy of 0.25mg palonosetron and b) study PALO-
15-17 demonstrates non-inferiority. 
The applicant does emphasise that they did consider the scientific advice in relation to assessing 
response after subsequent cycles of chemotherapy but did not consider a comparative efficacy study as 
the pivotal safety study NEPA-15-18 had already started recruiting patients. 
The difference in complete response rate especially in the delayed phase was unexpected considering 
that exposure was equivalent in study PNET-12-23. Moreover, the responses rates in the overall phase 
were considered as the focus of efficacy measures because the overall phase captures both the acute 
and delayed phases reflective of the indication. While a definitive explanation cannot be provided by 
the applicant, a few noteworthy points were raised in terms of the composite endpoint whereby “no 
emetic episodes” is the most objective component compared to “use of rescue medication” which is left 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 61/90 
 
 
 
to the patient’s decision. This point is further emphasised in the post hoc analyses that excluded the 
sites where there was inappropriate use of rescue medication. 
Furthermore, in order to support efficacy of IV NEPA FDC in the delayed phase, the applicant provided 
results from new study (NEPA 17-05) designed to evaluate the safety (primary endpoint) and efficacy 
(secondary endpoint) of IV NEPA FDC versus PO NEPA FDC for the prevention of CINV in female breast 
cancer patients receiving anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy (HEC). Descriptive 
efficacy results showed a lower difference in terms of complete response in the delayed phase between 
both arms in study NEPA-17-05 compared to study NEPA15-18 (-3.3% [-10.7;4.1] vs -9.2 [-16.5;-1.9] 
respectively) during cycle 1. However, no definitive conclusions can be made on these studies 
regarding the efficacy. 
The applicant references the SmPC guidelines stating that the descriptive efficacy results presented are 
not statistically compelling or clinically relevant to include in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Despite this, the 
CHMP regards this efficacy data (or lack of) as clinically relevant for the prescriber. Informing the 
clinician that the efficacy results are not interpretable explaining the reasons for not designing a non-
inferiority study is clinically relevant. However, given that a) NETU-10-29 (oral FDC versus aprepitant 
+ palonosetron) was also designed similarly with descriptive statistics and b) CHMP did not accept this 
data to be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC, the issue will not be further pursued.   
The imbalance of CR between males and females and the differential of efficacy in women receiving the 
infusion was further discussed. In study PALO 15-17, patients were stratified by gender in light of the 
known higher occurrence of CINV in females and the applicant provided a logistic regression model 
which did not find a gender interaction. Furthermore, the number of female patients were smaller 
(33%). While a difference between the two strata are expected, any difference between the infusion 
versus the bolus is not expected. The applicant states that there is no plausible clinical or PK rationales 
for a lower efficacy of infusion as compared to bolus in females and results should not be over-
interpreted. 
The gender imbalance between the two studies may be due to the difference in geographical regions 
(Ukraine not included in study PALO-15-17 where the majority of the patients with ovarian cancer 
came from) and type of cancer (ovarian cancer, H&N cancer and lung cancer), which seems reasonable 
as gender was included as a stratification factor at the time of randomization.  
While the newly submitted female only study NEPA-17-05 does not show a difference in efficacy 
between the two types of formulation, the results do not allow draw a firm conclusion on a difference 
in effectiveness between men and women since only women were included. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
NEPA-15-18 and PALO-15-17 in the presented application both enrolled patients receiving HEC only. 
NEPA enrolled 53% males while PALO enrolled 67% males. Comparing the proportion of MEC: HEC and 
Male: Female in studies NEPA-15-18, PALO-15-17 and also the 3 studies from the initial oral 
formulation application; NETU-10-29, NETU-08-18 and NETU-07-07, the data seem to suggest that 
males respond better to Akynzeo when receiving HEC than MEC.; females respond similarly to Akynzeo 
whether receiving HEC or MEC. However, in relation to gender, it is difficult to draw definitive 
conclusions from this data; the CHMP will not pursue this issue any further. 
It is acknowledged that the emetogenic potential of chemotherapy regimen is the most important 
predictor of CINV risk and therefore studies performed in patients receiving HEC is crucial. In all clinical 
submitted studies only patients receiving HEC regimens were included. No studies were conducted in 
the patients receiving MEC. This is in contrast to the studies performed for the oral formulation which 
included HEC and MEC. As per the EMA Guideline On Non-Clinical and Clinical Development Of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 62/90 
 
 
 
Medicinal Products For The Prevention Of Nausea And Vomiting Associated With Cancer Chemotherapy, 
studies specifically addressing this issue are expected. 
In the clinical overview it was stated: “If, however, at least non-inferior activity has been shown in a 
substitution study in case of highly emetogenic therapy and the use of the standard regimen is well 
documented also in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, extrapolation as regards activity might be 
feasible” 
In light of a) the duration of activity of the intravenous formulation and b) the reduced efficacy in the 
delayed phase in study NEPA-15-18, extrapolation of activity was not considered feasible. Therefore, 
the applicant was requested to further justify omitting studies in participants receiving MEC. The 
applicant considers that the IV NEPA FDC line extension was mainly based on a bioequivalence 
approach considering that fosnetupitant is rapidly and completely converted into netupitant. For this 
reason, the applicant considers that the data obtained with the oral form are applicable to the 
injectable form and there is no reason to regard the safety profile in patients receiving MEC any 
differently. However, one may wonder about the choice of not performing studies in patients receiving 
a MEC based chemotherapy while the oral form is registered for the prevention of CINV in patients 
receiving both cisplatin-based HEC chemotherapy or MEC regimen. 
There is no unequivocal demonstration of a shorter duration of activity of the intravenous formulation 
over the initial 120 hours following chemotherapy administration. The applicant provides a justification 
that a different duration of activity and a reduced efficacy of IV NEPA are not supported by PK/PD 
results which is accepted. This is further supported in the clinical pharmacology section;  the applicant 
provided 90% CIs for the ratio of the geometric means for AUC0-24h, AUC24-120h, and Cmin at 120 
hrs of netupitant for 260 mg IV pro-netupitant vs 300 mg oral netupitant. Bioequivalence between IV 
pro-netupitant and oral netupitant was demonstrated for these time intervals. 
The reduced activity in the delayed phase in study NEPA 15-18 is not fully understood but results 
submitted by the applicant from study NEPA 17-15 are supportive. Even though both studies were not 
designed or powered to compare efficacy of IV NEPA FDC vs PO NEPA FDC, the intravenous formulation 
was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the oral formulation, therefore the efficacy of IV NEPA FDC 
can be considered similar and is therefore acceptable. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal clinical study was primarily designed as a safety study and was not powered for 
comparative efficacy therefore it is difficult to draw definitive efficacy conclusions from this study. 
However, given that the overall application adopted a bioequivalence PK efficacy bridging approach 
with descriptive efficacy data only, these issues will no longer/will be pursued. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
For this line extension to the authorised oral netupitant-palonosetron fixed-dose combination (NEPA 
FDC - Akynzeo® hard capsules), safety data is drawn from the oral development program and post 
marketing since the approval and commercialisation of the oral formulation as well as from the IV 
NEPA FDC (intravenous netupitant-palonosetron fixed-dose combination) studies.  
Safety data for the IV NEPA FDC clinical development program are not integrated due to the design of 
the development program. There were two trials that administered the IV NEPA FDC in cancer patients 
(NEPA-15-18, NEPA-15-19), two that administered fosnetupitant alone in healthy volunteers (PNET-12-
23, PNET-13-63) and one that employed palonosetron alone (PALO-15-17).  No integration of safety 
data was deemed appropriate for the two studies NEPA-15-18 and NEPA 15-19 in cancer patients due 
to the clinical and methodological differences in the design and population (phase 3 safety vs. phase 1

PK, controlled vs. single arm, chemo naïve vs. naïve and non-naïve, multicycle vs. single cycle, 
respectively). 
NEPA-15-18 
NEPA-15-18 was a Phase 3, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 
active-controlled safety study conducted in chemotherapy-naïve adult male and female patients (ECOG 
Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2) who were diagnosed with a malignant solid tumour requiring at least 
4 cycles of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). The study was designed to assess the safety and 
tolerability of a single IV NEPA FDC dose in both initial and repeated cycles of chemotherapy. 
Patients were randomised to receive either the IV NEPA FDC or oral Akynzeo®; both treatment arms 
concomitantly received oral dexamethasone for CINV prophylaxis.  Study drugs were administered 30 
or 60 minutes prior to the start of the chemotherapy (IV and oral, respectively) on day 1, with oral 
dexamethasone being administered 30 minutes prior to the start of chemotherapy and also daily on 
days 2 to 4. 
Patients could continue to participate in up to 4 repeated cycles, provided that eligibility criteria were 
fulfilled. 
Safety was the primary objective; it included evaluation of physical examination and vital signs 
findings, 12-lead ECG results, safety laboratory test results (haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis), 
and adverse event monitoring. 
A total of 404 patients (203 IV FDC; 201 oral Akynzeo®) were treated in Study NEPA-15-18 and are 
included in the safety population; of these, approximately 60% went on to complete all 4 cycles. 
NEPA-15-19 
NEPA-15-19 was a Phase 1, single arm, open label pharmacokinetic and safety study conducted in 
adult male and female naïve or non-naïve patients scheduled to receive a cycle of HEC. All patients 
received the IV NEPA FDC (260 mg fosnetupitant/0.25 mg palonosetron) infused over 30 minutes 
starting from 30 minutes before HEC.  Oral dexamethasone was administered on Day 1 and also daily 
on days 2 to 4. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from plasma concentrations of fosnetupitant, netupitant, 
netupitant metabolites (M1, M2 and M3) and palonosetron. 
The safety variables evaluated in this study were: treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
physical examination (PE), vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory tests 
(haematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis). 
A total of 36 patients were treated in Study NEPA-15-19 and are included in the safety population. 
PNET-12-23 
This was a Phase 1, double-blind, controlled, parallel group, single ascending dose study in healthy 
male and female volunteers to assess the safety of intravenously administered fosnetupitant combined 
with crossover study extensions to estimate the dose of fosnetupitant yielding netupitant equivalent 
exposure to that provided by oral netupitant 300 mg/palonosetron 0.5 mg fixed dose combination. 
The study was designed in 3 parts, where doses of fosnetupitant ranging from 19.5 mg to 390 mg 
were administered either as a single dose or in a crossover fashion with oral Akynzeo®.  The primary 
objective was to assess the safety of pro-netupitant administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion.  
Safety assessments included, Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory test results (haematology, 
blood chemistry, urinalyses, and blood coagulation), vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram results, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020

physical examination findings. For the local tolerability assessment in addition to laboratory parameters 
an ultrasonography scanning of dosing and contralateral veins was performed. 
A total of 158 healthy subjects were treated with study drug in this trial and included in the safety 
population. 
PNET-13-63 
This was a Phase 1, randomized, three-period, four-treatment, incomplete block, crossover study in 
healthy male and female volunteers designed to evaluate the potential pharmacokinetic interaction 
between three doses of intravenous fosnetupitant and the oral dexamethasone regimen used for 
antiemetic prophylaxis.   
Safety population of the study includes a total of 30 healthy subjects. 
PALO-15-17 
PALO-15-17 was a Phase 3, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 
parallel-group study conducted in chemotherapy-naïve adult male and female patients with a 
malignant solid tumour who were scheduled to have their first cycle of one of the protocol-specified 
reference HEC regimens. The study was designed to support the IV NEPA FDC program by establishing 
the non-inferiority of a single intravenous (IV) dose of palonosetron 0.25 mg administered as a 30-
minute (min) infusion versus a single IV dose of palonosetron 0.25 (Aloxi®) mg administered as a 30-
second (sec) bolus (FDA-approved regimen) prior to HEC. Patients in both treatment arms received 
oral dexamethasone prior to HEC on day 1, and daily [BID] from days 2 through 4. 
Safety was assessed by the evaluation of physical examination and vital signs findings, 12-lead ECG 
results, safety laboratory test results (haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis), and adverse event 
monitoring. 
A total of 440 patients (225 in the 30-minute infusion group; 215 in the bolus group) were treated in 
Study PALO-15-17 and are included in the safety population. 
Patient exposure 
In study NEPA-15-18, the safety population (all patients who had received at least one dose of active 
study drug [including partial infusion]) included a total of 404 cancer patients treated in up to 4 cycles.  
Approximately 60% of patients in NEPA-15-18 completed the 4 cycles. Overall, there were 404 
patients treated in Cycle 1, 356 patients treated in Cycle 2, 313 patients treated in Cycle 3, and 239 
patients treated in Cycle 4.  Patients treated in the IV and oral NEPA groups throughout the 4 cycles 
were, 
•  Cycle 1: 203 patients IV NEPA, 201 patients oral NEPA 
•  Cycle 2: 179 patients IV NEPA, 177 patients oral NEPA 
•  Cycle 3: 163 patients IV NEPA, 150 patients oral NEPA 
•  Cycle 4: 122 patients IV NEPA, 117 patients oral NEPA 
All patients treated with either IV or oral NEPA FDC also received oral dexamethasone. 
Study NEPA 15-19 included 36 cancer patients treated for one cycle.  12 of the patients were 
mistakenly under-dosed due to incomplete administration of the IV NEPA FDC volume caused by 
technical issues with the infusion pump detector system however the 12 patients were replaced for PK 
evaluations and a total of 36 patients was included in the safety population.

Adverse events 
The analysis of adverse events was based on treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) defined as AEs that 
began or worsened in severity after the start of the first administration of the study drug through study 
completion. 
NEPA-15-18 
Of the 404 patients in the safety population, 343 (84.9%) patients experienced at least one TEAE, and 
the incidence of TEAEs was similar between the treatment groups: 83.3% of patients in the IV NEPA 
FDC group and 86.6% of patients in the oral NEPA FDC group. 
TEAEs were most commonly reported in body systems that are most often involved with the cytotoxic 
effects of chemotherapy administration. Overall, throughout the entire study and in both the treatment 
groups, TEAEs were most commonly reported (>15%) in the following SOCs: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
blood and lymphatic system disorders (46.3%); 
gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (28.0%); 
general disorders and administration site conditions (25.7%); 
investigations (22.5%); and 
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (18.1%). 
An overview of TEAEs throughout the NEPA-15-18 study is summarised in Table 5 below. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (i.e., those reported by > 5% of patients in either treatment 
group) were anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, constipation, nausea, asthenia, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020

fatigue, ALT increased, AST increased, blood creatinine increased, decreased appetite, alopecia, 
headache, and hypertension. These events generally occurred in similar percentages of patients across 
the IV and oral NEPA groups. 
The satisfactory local tolerability observed in Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects with fosnetupitant 
alone was confirmed in study NEPA-15-18 in cancer patients with IV NEPA FDC.  The frequency of 
TEAEs potentially suggestive of a local tolerability issue (e.g. injection site extravasation, infusion site 
extravasation, injection site reaction) was small and also reported for the oral treatment group (where 
a placebo infusion was administered). In addition, the frequency of TEAEs was small (≤ 1.0%) and 
similar between the two treatment groups for phlebitis and thrombophlebitis.  None of these TEAEs 
were considered by the Investigator as related to treatment with study drug. 
TEAEs related to study drug were reported for 26 (12.8%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and for 
23 (11.4%) patients in the oral NEPA FDC group. Frequency and type of TEAEs were similar in the two 
treatment groups. The only two events reported in more than 2% of patients in both treatment groups 
were constipation and ALT increases. Constipation was reported by 13 [6.4%] patients in the IV NEPA 
FDC group and 12 [6.0%] patients in the oral NEPA FDC group and ALT increases were experienced by 
4 patients (2.0%) in each treatment group.  
Overall, 47 (11.6%) and 120 (29.7%) patients experienced exclusively mild and moderate (Grades 1 
and 2) events, respectively. These events were reported in similar numbers of patients in both 
treatment groups (Grade 1: 23 [11.3%] patients in the IV NEPA and 24 [11.9%] patients in the Oral 
NEPA group; Grade 2: 60 [29.6%] patients and 60 [29.9%] in the IV NEPA and Oral NEPA groups, 
respectively). The pattern of mild and moderate events reflected the overall AE profile of the study; 
events occurred most frequently in the following SOCs and PTs: Blood and Lymphatic System 
Disorders (neutropenia, anaemia), Gastrointestinal SOC (nausea, constipation), General Disorders 
(asthenia, fatigue), and Investigations (AST, ALT and Creatinine increased). 
Overall, Grade 3 TEAEs were experienced by 61 (30.0%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 54 
(26.9%) patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group, and Grade 4 TEAEs were experienced by 15 (7.4%) 
patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 22 (10.9%) patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group. As expected, 
neutropenia was the most frequent Grade 3/4 TEAE reported during this study (37 [18.2%] patients in 
the IV NEPA FDC group and 37 [18.4%] patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group).  Severe TEAEs were 
reported for 86 (42.4%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 90 (44.8%) patients in the Oral NEPA 
FDC group. For IV NEPA FDC, 2 patients (1.0%) experienced severe TEAEs related to study drug and 3 
patients (1.5%) experienced severe TEAEs related to dexamethasone. For Oral NEPA FDC, 3 patients 
(1.5%) experienced severe TEAEs related to study drug and 6 patients (3.0%) experienced severe 
TEAEs related to dexamethasone.

TEAEs   
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported for 16 (7.9%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group 
and 20 (10.0%) patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group. 
The frequency distribution of TEAE severity (CTCAE Grades 1-4) was similar across the treatment 
groups. TEAEs leading to death were reported for 10 (4.9%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 14 
(7.0%) patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group.  None of them was assessed as related to study drug. 
There was no increased incidence of TEAE or suggestion of accumulated toxicity with repeated dosing. 
Adverse events of special interest in this study: 
1. 
Electrocardiogram QT prolonged:  QT prolongation was identified as an AE of special 
interest, and changes in QT intervals were monitored closely.  Overall, electrocardiogram 
QT prolonged events were reported for 5 (1.2%) patients, all treated at the same study 
site.  All events were Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 
and all were non-serious events. The events were assessed as possibly related (2 patients 
in the IV NEPA FDC group and 1 patient in the Oral NEPA FDC group), probably related (1 
patient in the IV NEPA FDC group), and not related (1 patient in the Oral NEPA FDC group) 
to study drug.  Changes for heart rate and all other intervals were small and similar 
between treatment groups. 
2. 
Constipation: Constipation, a known TEAE observed also with the oral formulation during 
the clinical development program, was reported for 47 (11.6%) patients overall: 21 
(10.3%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 26 (12.9%) patients in the Oral NEPA FDC

group. Only 1 (0.5%) patient in the IV NEPA FDC group had a Grade 3 case of constipation 
during the study. The event was considered by the Investigator as a non-serious TEAE, not 
related to treatment with study drug or dexamethasone.   
NEPA-15-19 
A total of 62 adverse events in 22 (61.1%) patients were TEAEs. The most common (reported in 7 or 
more patients) occurred in the following SOCs: gastrointestinal disorders (16; 44.4%), general 
disorders (8; 22.2%) and vascular disorders (7; 19.4%).  Specific preferred terms reported in 3 or 
more patients included constipation (8; 22.2%), nausea (5; 13.9%), peripheral swelling (4;11.1%), 
asthenia (3; 8.3%) and dizziness (3; 8.3%).  
Fourteen (14) of the 62 TEAEs were considered related to the study medication in 8 (22.2%) patients 
and 5 TEAEs were considered related to dexamethasone in 4 (11.1%) patients. 
Table 18 
All TEAEs reported in this study were either mild or moderate in severity. Fifteen patients (41.7% of 
safety population) reported exclusively mild TEAEs, while 7 patients (19.4% of the safety population) 
experienced TEAEs of moderate severity. Moderate intensity events included constipation, nausea, 
vomiting, asthenia, headache, swelling face, flushing, and hypertension.  No patient reported severe or 
life-threatening (CTC grade ≥3) TEAEs. 
PNET-12-23 
Overall, 169 TEAEs were observed after drug administration in 80 of the 158 subjects (50.6%). Most of 
these events (108 events, 63.9%) were assessed as drug-related.  All TEAEs were of mild or moderate 
intensity.  No death and no other serious adverse events occurred in this study.

Most of the TEAEs observed after treatment with either active IV infusion or active oral drug belonged 
to the following MedDRA system organ class: General disorders and administration site conditions (56 
TEAEs in 40 subjects), Nervous system disorders (50 TEAEs in 34 subjects), and Gastrointestinal 
disorders (39 TEAEs in 26 subjects). The frequency of subjects with gastrointestinal disorders was 
higher with the oral formulation compared to the IV formulation (14.9% vs. 6.1%). 
The frequency of subjects presenting administration site reactions was only slightly higher with the IV 
formulation compared to the oral formulation (18.9% vs. 14.9%) due to vessel puncture site 
thrombosis at the contralateral arm (blood withdrawal arm) observed in both groups. The most 
frequently reported TEAE after both administration routes was headache. The frequency of subjects 
with headache was higher with the oral formulation compared to the IV formulation (15.7% vs. 8.1%). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs assessed as drug-related were headache (33 events), constipation 
(12 events), infusion site thrombosis (10 events), abdominal pain upper (9 events), fatigue (9 events), 
dizziness (7 events), and nausea (6 events). The number of drug-related TEAEs or frequency of 
subjects with drug-related TEAEs did not increase with ascending pro-netupitant doses. The following 
drug-related gastrointestinal events occurred mainly after oral administration of netupitant 300 
mg/palonosetron 0.5 mg compared to IV pro-netupitant (any dose): constipation (10 and 2 events), 
abdominal pain upper (6 and 3 events), and nausea (4 and 2 events).  Oppositely, the following drug-
related adverse events were more frequently observed with the IV pro-netupitant treatment compared 
to oral netupitant 300 mg/palonosetron 0.5 mg: infusion site thrombosis (8 and 2 events), fatigue (6 
and 3 events), and dizziness (4 and 3 events) occurred mainly after IV administration of pro-
netupitant.  
The most frequently reported drug-related TEAE after the active drug administration following both 
routes was headache. The frequency of headache adverse events considered as drug-related was lower 
after IV administration (8.1% of IV treated subjects) compared to oral administration (12.7% of oral 
treated subjects). 
A total of 38 thrombotic events have been observed during the study. These TEAEs were reported with 
a clearly higher frequency as cases involving the contralateral blood drawing vein (28 events) 
compared to cases involving the dosing vein (10 events). A total of 8 drug-related TEAEs of infusion

site thrombosis of mild severity were observed after IV administration (1 subject treated with 195 mg, 
2 subjects treated with 234 mg, 4 subjects treated with 260 mg, and 1 subject treated with 286 mg). 
All 8 events recovered. The percentage of subjects with infusion site thrombosis with respect to the 
number of subjects treated with the respective dose was 3.6% for 195 mg (1 of 28 treated subjects), 
10.5% for 234 mg (2 of 19 treated subjects), 13.3% for 260 mg (4 of 30 treated subjects) and 5.6% 
for 286 mg (1 of 18 treated subjects). No thrombotic events were observed with doses above 286 mg 
pro-netupitant. 
Applicant study report safety summary: 
•  Single doses of 19.5 mg to 390 mg pro-netupitant were well tolerated after administration via 
IV infusion, at 2.6 mg/mL concentration over 30 min. The proportion of subjects with drug-
related TEAEs or the number of drug-related TEAEs did not increase with ascending pro-
netupitant doses. 
•  Some differences in the safety profile after administration of the IV formulation containing pro-
netupitant and the oral FDC containing netupitant and palonosetron may be related to the 
route of administration and/or to the presence of palonosetron. 
• 
• 
Pro-netupitant was locally well tolerated after IV administration by IV infusion over 30 min at 
the concentration of 2.6 mg/mL. 
The safety results were in line with the current knowledge about the safety of netupitant. 
•  No notable effect of the IMP on safety laboratory parameters, vital signs, or ECG became 
apparent during the study. 
PALO-15-17 
The incidence of TEAEs was similar between treatment groups: 37.8% in the infusion and 35.8% in the 
bolus group. Neutropenia and asthenia were the only TEAEs experienced by at least 5% of patients. 
Severe TEAEs were reported for 16 (7.1%) patients in the infusion group and 18 (8.4%) patients in the 
bolus group. Serious TEAEs were reported for 15 (6.7%) patients in the infusion group and 12 (5.6%) 
patients in the bolus group.

Note: Only those PTs of CTCAE Grades 3 or 4 are shown. TEAEs of Grade 5 are discussed 
separately in section 12.3.1.1 Deaths. A complete list of PTs of all grades is provided in the 
source table. 
Overall, 13 patients died: 6 (2.7%) patients in the infusion group and 7 (3.3%) patients in the bolus 
group. 
No patient withdrew from the study due to a TEAE. 
TEAEs related to study drug were reported for 8 (3.6%) patients in the infusion group and 3 (1.4%) 
patients in the bolus group. Only constipation was reported as a TEAE related to study drug for more 
than 2% of patients in either treatment group; this TEAE was experienced by 5 (2.2%) patients in the 
infusion group and 2 (0.9%) patients in the bolus group. 
One patient in the infusion group experienced 2 severe TEAEs classified as possibly related to study 
drug (atrial flutter [Grade 5] and dyspnoea [Grade 4]); both events were classified as serious and the 
event of atrial flutter led to the patient’s death (note that this patient’s medical history at study entry 
included atrial flutter).

There were no safety concerns for laboratory parameters. Analysis of ECG data indicated that changes 
in QTc interval values were observed at a similar frequency in both treatment groups. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
NEPA-15-18 
Serious adverse events 
Serious TEAEs were reported for 41 (20.2%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 43 (21.4%) 
patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group.  The most frequently reported (≥2% of patients in either 
treatment group) serious TEAEs were those expected in the cancer population under chemotherapy 
treatment including neutropenia (6 [3.0%] patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 8 [4.0%] patients in 
the oral NEPA FDC group), pneumonia (6 [3.0%] patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 4 [2.0%] 
patients in the oral NEPA FDC group), thrombocytopenia (1 [0.5%] patient in the IV NEPA FDC group 
and 4 [2.0%] patients in the oral NEPA FDC group), and anaemia (no patients in the IV NEPA FDC 
group and 4 [2.0%] patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group).

No serious TEAEs were assessed as related to study drug. One patient (0.5%) in the IV NEPA FDC 
group experienced serious TEAEs related to dexamethasone, and 5 patients (2.5%) in the Oral NEPA 
FDC group experienced serious TEAEs related to dexamethasone. 
There was no evidence of increased incidences of SAEs with increasing exposure. 
Deaths 
TEAEs leading to death were reported for 10 (4.9%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 14 (7.0%) 
patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group.  None of them was assessed as related to study drug. 
The most frequent preferred terms for patients who died during the NEPA-15-18 study were: sudden 
death (4 patients; 1 in the IV NEPA group and 3 in the oral NEPA group), pneumonia (2 patients, 1 in 
each treatment group) and sepsis (2 patients in the oral NEPA group). All other PTs occurred in only 
one patient.

Laboratory findings 
Studies NEPA-15-18 and NEPA-15-19 
Routine laboratory tests included haematology, chemistry and urinalysis at screening, day 2 and day 6 
of each cycle during the Phase 3 repeated cycles safety study (NEPA-15-18) and were analysed at a 
central laboratory. For the Phase 1 Study (NEPA-15-19), blood and urine for laboratory evaluations 
were collected at screening (day 1) and follow up (day 21) and were analysed at the local laboratory of 
the single site conducting the study. 
As expected, in patients receiving chemotherapy over repeated cycles, leukopenia (including 
neutropenia, monocytopenia and granulocytopenia), anaemia and thrombocytopenia were observed 
with generally similar reductions in patients receiving the IV NEPA FDC and oral NEPA FDC. There was 
no apparent influence of repeat exposure to investigational product on haematology parameters. No 
clinically meaningful differences in haematology were observed between the treatment groups after 
both single cycle and repeated cycle exposure. 
PNET-12-23 
No notable effect of the IMP on safety laboratory parameters were reported. 
PALO-15-17 
There were no safety concerns for haematology and blood chemistry parameters. The spectrum of 
laboratory changes observed during the study is typical of laboratory findings detected in the setting of 
oncologic patients receiving HEC and/or treatment with dexamethasone.

Safety in special populations 
Age: 
In the safety study NEPA-15-18, a total of 7 IV NEPA treated patients out of 203 (3.4%) were ≥ 75 
years of age. Age was evaluated as a post-hoc analysis and did not reveal any differences that would 
require special consideration. 
Gender: 
Gender was a stratification factor and was evaluated in study NEPA-15-18.  No significant effect was 
revealed. 
Gender did not affect netupitant PK after NEPA IV FDC administration in cancer patients (NEPA-15-19). 
Race 
As far as race is concerned, 99.3% of patients in the NEPA-15-18 study were white, therefore an 
analysis by race is not meaningful; however race was evaluated in the oral Akynzeo program.  No 
differences were revealed for patient gender that would require any special consideration. 
Renal impairment: 
No specific studies were performed to evaluate fosnetupitant in patients with renal impairment.  
However, due to the transient exposure of fosnetupitant and subsequent conversion to netupitant 
there are no additional warnings considered necessary with the administration of the prodrug 
compared to the parent compound. 
In healthy volunteers receiving oral netupitant, less than 5% of all drug-related material was excreted 
in urine and less than 1% of the netupitant dose was eliminated unchanged in the urine. No dosage 
adjustment for Akynzeo® is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Use of 
Akynzeo® should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. 
Hepatic impairment: 
No studies were performed specifically with IV fosnetupitant in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Following oral Akynzeo® administration, Cmax and total exposure of netupitant (AUC0-inf) were 
increased in subjects with mild (n=8), moderate (n=8), and severe (n=2) hepatic impairment 
compared to matching healthy subjects, although there was pronounced individual variability in both 
hepatically impaired and healthy subjects. 
Total palonosetron exposure was also increased in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment compared to matching healthy subjects. 
Although the increases were statistically significant, they are of questionable clinical significance as 
variability in the healthy control groups was large and renders the comparisons difficult to interpret. 
Safety data in the hepatic impairment study showed no differences between subjects with hepatic 
impairment and healthy subjects with respect to safety profile. Limited conclusions can be drawn for 
patients with severe hepatic impairment due to the low number of subjects included in this group. 
Based on these data, no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-9). Limited data exist in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh score ≥10). Use of Akynzeo® should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Pregnancy and lactation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 76/90 
 
 
 
No cases of pregnancy occurred during the IV NEPA FDC development program.  Furthermore, there 
are no concerning signals or causes for concern in fosnetupitant, netupitant or palonosetron preclinical 
genotoxicity and reproduction studies at the proposed clinical concentration ranges.  However, safety 
in human pregnancy has not been established for either palonosetron or netupitant, and animal 
reproduction studies do not always predict human response; the FDC should not be used during 
pregnancy, unless it is considered essential by the physician. 
It is unknown whether netupitant or palonosetron are excreted in breast milk. Because many drugs are 
excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants 
and the potential for tumorigenicity shown for palonosetron in the rat carcinogenicity study, caution 
should be exercised if the IV NEPA FDC is to be administered to nursing women. A decision should be 
made whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of the IV NEPA FDC to the woman. 
Paediatric Population 
No safety data are available in paediatric patients.  An agreed PIP is provided in Module 1.10. 
Immunological events 
N/A 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
A comprehensive evaluation of drug interactions was conducted during the oral Akynzeo® 
development program. To supplement these studies, in vitro and in vivo studies with fosnetupitant 
were conducted during the IV development program.  
Drug interactions with the IV NEPA FDC are attributed to the netupitant component, as exposure to 
fosnetupitant is limited and the prodrug is rapidly converted to netupitant. There are no known drug 
interactions with palonosetron. 
Drug interactions with fosnetupitant were evaluated during the IV NEPA FDC program as follows: 1) a 
clinical trial in healthy subjects with dexamethasone (PNET-13-63), 2) in vitro followed by in silico 
studies with fosnetupitant.

Table 20: Overview of drug interaction studies performed with oral netupitant single agent 
or in combination with palonosetron during the oral Akynzeo program. 
Study PNET-13-63 
This was a Phase 1, randomized, three-period, four-treatment, incomplete block, crossover study in 
healthy male and female volunteers designed to evaluate the potential pharmacokinetic interaction 
between three doses of intravenous fosnetupitant and the oral dexamethasone regimen used for 
antiemetic prophylaxis.  Safety was a secondary objective. 
Safety population of the study includes a total of 30 healthy subjects. 
A total of 143 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), all of mild and moderate severity were 
reported by 25 of the 30 subjects (83.3% of subjects).  No serious adverse events occurred and none 
of the subjects discontinued the study due to an adverse event. Most of the events were considered 
related to pro-netupitant (98 of 143 events) and dexamethasone (118 of 143 events). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 78/90 
 
 
 
 
The frequency of subjects with at least one TEAE was generally higher after administration of 
dexamethasone together with pro-netupitant (between 66.7% after Treatment D and 85.0% of 
subjects after Treatment C) than after administration of dexamethasone alone (60.7% of subjects). No 
dose dependency was observed with a similar frequency between Treatments A and D (60.7% and 
66.7% of subjects with at least one TEAE, respectively).  This was also the case when drug-related 
TEAEs were considered. 
All 3 dose levels of fosnetupitant (130 mg, 195 mg and 260 mg) administered with increasing drug 
concentration in the infusion solution (2.6 mg/mL, 3.9 mg/mL and 5.2 mg/mL, respectively were well 
tolerated. 
The IV and oral NEPA FDC should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant medications 
that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 due to the known CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions. 
Chemotherapy agents that are known to be metabolized by CYP3A4 include docetaxel, paclitaxel, 
etoposide, irinotecan, ifosfamide, imatinib, vinorelbine, vinblastine, and vincristine. Doses adjustment 
of these agents in clinical trials either in the oral or IV NEPA FDC program were not necessary, and no 
safety concerns identified in this population. Caution and careful monitoring are advised in patients 
receiving these agents or other chemotherapy agents metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 that were not 
studied. 
For dexamethasone, the same dose adjustment as that approved for Akynzeo® capsules is proposed 
for IV NEPA FDC. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Study NEPA-15-18 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported for 16 (7.9%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group 
and 20 (10.0%) patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group.  The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation from the study were disease progression (6 [3.0%] patients in each treatment group) 
and renal failure (3 [1.5%] patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 1 [0.5%] patient in the oral NEPA 
FDC group). All other TEAEs leading to discontinuation occurred with a frequency of less than or equal 
to 1.0% of patients in either treatment group.  
Study-drug-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation, were experienced by a total of 3 (0.7%) patients 
(2 [1.0%] patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 1 [0.5%] patient in the oral NEPA FDC group).  
The PT reported were: 
• 
• 
• 
disease progression (IV NEPA FDC Group, Cycle 2),  
hypersensitivity (oral NEPA FDC group, Cycle 2) and  
hepatic enzymes increased (IV NEPA FDC group, Cycle 1).  
[Module 5.3.5.1, NEPA-15-18, Table 14.3.2.13 and Table 14.3.2.14]. 
The incidence of adverse events leading to patient withdrawal was similar in the first 3 cycles.   
No adverse events leading to withdrawal occurred in cycle 4.  
Study NEPA-15-19 
No adverse events leading to withdrawal occurred in study NEPA-15-19. 
Study PNET-12-23 
One subject discontinued the study prematurely due to adverse events prior to first dosing (vasovagal 
syncope and dizziness). In two other subjects, the infusion of the study drug was interrupted and

restarted during administration of the active product due to adverse events (“swelling around the 
infusion site” and “strange sensation at infusion site”).  Both events were considered to be unlikely 
related to the study drug.   
Study PALO-15-17 
No patient withdrew from the study due to a TEAE. 
Post marketing experience 
As of May 8th, 2018, the IV NEPA FDC has not been marketed yet. 
Oral Akynzeo® has been marketed since October 2014.   Regular PSURs have been submitted by the 
sponsor. 
Based on sales data, approximately 112,000 patients have been treated with the oral combination 
worldwide, considering for each patient an average of 6 cycles of chemotherapy preceded by 
antiemetic prophylaxis with Akynzeo®. 
Collectively, there is no evidence of any change in the clinical pattern of Akynzeo® ADRs or of any new 
qualitative or quantitative safety concern from the 3 and half years post-marketing experience. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data for the IV NEPA FDC clinical development program are not integrated due to the design of 
the development program.  There were two trials that administered the IV NEPA FDC in cancer patients 
(NEPA-15-18, NEPA-15-19), two that administered intravenous fosnetupitant alone in healthy 
volunteers (PNET-12-23, PNET-13-63) and one that employed intravenous palonosetron alone (PALO-
15-17) as outlined above.  The focus of safety data presented in the dossier is derived primarily from 
the pivotal safety study NEPA-15-18 and also the PK study NEPA-15-19 with safety evaluation as a 
secondary objective.  Safety data from studies which administered fosnetupitant or palonosetron as 
single agents are considered supportive. 
A total of 239 cancer patients received at least one dose of the IV NEPA FDC in studies NEPA 15-18 
and NEPA 15-19. 
Study NEPA-15-18 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
constipation, nausea, asthenia, fatigue, ALT increased, AST increased, blood creatinine increased, 
decreased appetite, alopecia, headache, and hypertension.  These events generally occurred in similar 
percentages of patients across the IV and oral NEPA groups.   
Anaemia and thrombocytopenia are not seen in section 4.8 of the smPC for the hard capsule Akynzeo 
formulation however the applicant explains that the most frequently reported (≥2% of patients in 
either treatment group) serious TEAEs were those expected in the cancer population under 
chemotherapy treatment including anaemia (no patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 4 [2.0%] 
patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group) and thrombocytopenia (1 [0.5%] patient in the IV NEPA FDC 
group and 4 [2.0%] patients in the oral NEPA FDC group). 
The only two events reported in more than 2% of patients in both treatment groups were constipation 
and ALT increases.  Both of these events are listed as possible undesirable effects in the SmPC of the 
hard capsule Akynzeo formulation at frequencies of common (≥1/100 to <1/10) and uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100) respectively and so are not new to the intravenous formulation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 80/90 
 
 
 
The satisfactory local tolerability observed in Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects with fosnetupitant 
alone and further confirmed in study NEPA-15-18 in cancer patients with IV NEPA FDC is reassuring. 
The frequency and type of serious adverse events were reported to be similar in the two treatment 
groups and no serious TEAEs were assessed as related to study drug. It is also noted that the most 
frequently reported (≥2% of patients in either treatment group) serious TEAEs were those expected in 
the cancer population under chemotherapy treatment. 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported in similar numbers for both the oral and IV NEPA 
FDC groups.  Increased hepatic enzymes is already listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC of the oral 
formulation as an uncommon adverse reaction and so is not new to the intravenous formulation. 
TEAEs of special interest in this study were captured in the MedDRA PTs “electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged” and severe (Grade 3 or 4) “constipation”.   
Electrocardiogram QT prolonged: All events were non-serious events and no relevant differences 
between IV NEPA FDC and oral NEPA FDC were detected with regard to increased QTc.  These results 
together with the satisfactory results of the thorough QT study completed with the oral FDC indicate a 
satisfactory cardiac safety profile for the IV NEPA FDC. 
Constipation is a known TEAE observed also with the oral formulation during the clinical development 
program and was reported in similar numbers in both treatment groups. 
Study NEPA-15-19 
All TEAEs reported in this study were either mild or moderate in severity. Moderate intensity events 
included constipation, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, headache, swelling face, flushing, and hypertension.  
No patient reported severe or life-threatening TEAEs.  
Most of the TEAEs are mentioned as possible undesirable effects in section 4.8 of the SmPC of the 
authorised hard capsule Akynzeo formulation except for the occurrence of swelling face/peripheral 
swelling.  In study NEPA-15-19, only one TEAE of peripheral swelling (grade 1) was considered as 
possibly related to study drug and neither swelling face nor peripheral swelling were reported in the 
key safety study NEPA-14-18. The applicant therefore does not consider that swelling face or 
peripheral swelling need to be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC for this formulation.  
No adverse events leading to withdrawal and no serious adverse events or deaths were reported in 
study NEPA-15-19. 
Study PNET-12-23 
Overall, 169 TEAEs were observed after drug administration in 80 of the 158 subjects (50.6%). Most of 
these events (108 events, 63.9%) were assessed as drug-related.  All TEAEs were of mild or moderate 
intensity.  No death and no other serious adverse events occurred in this study. 
In this study, single doses of 19.5 mg to 390 mg pro-netupitant were reported to be well tolerated 
after administration via IV infusion, at 2.6 mg/mL concentration over 30 min and the proportion of 
subjects with drug-related TEAEs or the number of drug-related TEAEs did not increase with ascending 
pro-netupitant doses.  
Some differences in the safety profile after administration of the IV pro-netupitant formulation and the 
oral netupitant and palonosetron FDC were attributed to the route of administration and/or to the 
presence of palonosetron.   
In healthy volunteer studies, infusion site reactions occurred either as infusion site thrombosis or 
vessel puncture site thrombosis (mostly in PNET-12-23 due to a higher number of subjects). Can this 
difference be related to different administration pattern (Intravenous versus infusion through an 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 81/90 
 
 
 
implantable venous access device)? The Applicant was asked to further discuss this issue comparing 
with the low number of such events in cancer patient studies. The Applicant clarified that the higher 
rate of infusion site reactions observed in healthy volunteers compared to patients seems to be related 
to the use of a particular ultrasound examination technique in volunteers during PNET-12-23 study.  
It was noted that the Cmax for netupitant after 260 mg IV pro-netupitant (840.8 ug/L) was ~1.76 
times higher than the Cmax after 300 mg oral netupitant (477.3 ug/L) which may have implications for 
safety. (See section 2.1.3 of this report).  The applicant was asked to discuss this. In the response, the 
Applicant acknowledges that the Cmax of netupitant was higher following the IV NEPA combination 
infusion compared to the lower Cmax following the oral administration of netupitant/palonosetron and 
indeed that it was expected to be.  As evidence that a higher netupitant Cmax obtained following IV 
NEPA administration is not expected to adversely affect the safety of IV NEPA compared to oral NEPA 
the Applicant refers to the satisfactory safety results from studies NEPA-15-18 and NEPA-17-05.  
Study PALO-15-17 
The incidence of TEAEs was similar between treatment groups which supports the study report 
conclusion which is that the study demonstrated that slow infusion of palonosetron 0.25 mg represents 
a safe and effective alternative to the approved bolus infusion for patients with a diagnosis of 
malignant solid tumour requiring treatment with HEC regimens. 
No serious adverse events or deaths were reported in studies NEPA-15-19 or PNET-12-23. 
The incidence of serious adverse events and deaths were similar between treatment groups in study 
PALO-15-17.   
In NEPA-15-18, 10 and 14 deaths occurred in NEPA IV infusion and oral NEPA FDC, respectively, and 
41 and 43 serious TAEA, respectively. Deaths occurred more frequently in the oral group than in IV 
infusion group.  
From study PALONO-15-17, TEAEs leading to death were reported for 13 patients: 6 (2.7%) patients in 
the infusion group and 7 (3.3%) patients in the bolus group. 
For studies NEPA-15-18 and PALONO-15-17, no summary and no discussion were initially provided by 
the Applicant, only cross-references towards narratives. Consequently, the Applicant was requested to 
provide a summary and a discussion of deaths as well as cases of serious adverse events and 
withdrawal should be provided for each treatment group in the form of a table, separating deaths from 
serious adverse events and withdrawals. The Applicant provided a summary of cases of deaths and 
discontinuations with information regarding patient treatments and comorbidities. For all cases, death 
and discontinuations can be related to the evolution of main disease for which they received 
fosnetupitant (i.e metastatic cancer) or associated comorbidities and/or can be due to chemotherapy 
adverse effects.  
Based on Studies NEPA-15-18 and NEPA-15-19, there was no obvious indication of treatment-related 
effects on chemistry or urinalysis parameters across treatment groups. 
No notable effect of the IMP on safety laboratory parameters were reported in studies PNET-12-23 and 
PALO-15-17. 
Taking into consideration data from both the oral Akynzeo® program and the IV NEPA studies NEPA-
15-18 and NEPA-15-19, no differences were revealed for patient age, race or gender that would 
require any special consideration. 
Taking into consideration data from both the oral Akynzeo® program and the IV NEPA study NEPA-15-
18, subgroup analyses based on renal function did not reveal any differences that would require special 
consideration.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020

ALT and AST increases were noted to have occurred in 2 (1%) and 3 (1.5%) subjects respectively who 
received IV NEPA FDC and in 14 (7%) and 5 (2.5%) subjects respectively who received oral NEPA FDC 
in study NEPA-15-18. It is noted that liver transaminases increased is listed as an uncommon adverse 
reaction in the proposed SmPC and the SmPC of the oral Akynzeo formulation.  Taking into 
consideration data from both the oral Akynzeo® program and the IV NEPA study NEPA-15-18, no 
dosage adjustment is proposed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score 5-9).  Caution is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score 
≥9).   
No cases of pregnancy occurred during the IV NEPA FDC development program.  Furthermore, there 
are no concerning signals or causes for concern in fosnetupitant, netupitant or palonosetron preclinical 
genotoxicity and reproduction studies at the proposed clinical concentration ranges.  However, safety 
in human pregnancy has not been established for either palonosetron or netupitant, and animal 
reproduction studies do not always predict human response.   Use in pregnancy is proposed to be 
contraindicated according to the proposed SmpC. 
It is unknown whether netupitant or palonosetron are excreted in breast milk. Because many drugs are 
excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants 
and the potential for tumorigenicity shown for palonosetron in the rat carcinogenicity study, caution 
should be exercised if the IV NEPA FDC is to be administered to nursing women.  
No safety data are available in paediatric patients.  Use in the paediatric population is not indicated.  
The proposed SmPC reflects the fact that no safety data are available in paediatric patients. 
Based on the results of study PNET-13-63, the same dose adjustment for dexamethasone as that 
approved for Akynzeo® capsules is proposed for IV NEPA FDC.  As per the oral NEPA FDC SmPC, the 
proposed IV NEPA FDC SmPC recommends caution in patients receiving concomitant medications that 
are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 due to the known CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions.  No new 
safety related drug-drug or other interactions have been identified. 
In study NEPA-15-18, TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported in similar numbers for 
both the oral and IV NEPA FDC groups.   
There were no adverse events leading to withdrawal occurred in studies NEPA-15-19 and PALO-15-17. 
Two study drug interruption events reported in study PNET-12-23 were not considered to be related to 
the study drug. 
Fosnetupitant is classified as phototoxic however the Applicant has adequately justified why this is not 
considered to be clinically relevant considering that:  fosnetupitant binds to melanin in the uveal tract 
and in the eye but not remarkably in the skin; fosnetupitant rapidly disappears from the systemic 
circulation in humans by hydrolysis to netupitant, which was not indicated as a phototoxic compound;  
fosnetupitant is given intravenously and no topical application is foreseen; fosnetupitant is not a drug 
for chronic use. It is administered as a single dose treatment in hospital environment on day 1 of 
cancer chemotherapy cycles. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP considers that the safety profile of the IV NEPA FDC has been shown to be similar to the 
approved oral NEPA FDC Akynzeo.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Akynzeo is currently licensed in adults as an oral capsule for the prevention of acute and delayed 
vomiting associated with both a) moderately and b) highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 85/90 
 
 
 
 
current application is a line extension for an intravenous formulation associated with a new strength in 
the same indications. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment options commonly prescribed for CINV include serotonin (5-HT3) receptor 
antagonists, glucocorticosteroids, benzodiazepines and dopamine receptor antagonists. 
The option for clinicians to administer an intravenous formulation of a fixed dose combination anti-
emetic drug that acts both on the acute and delayed phase of CINV would be considered beneficial. 
While there are serotonin and neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists approved in the EU, no intravenous 
FDC is currently available for patients to receive. In particular neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists have 
well documented activity against cisplatin induced delayed emesis. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study for bridging PK with efficacy is PNET-12-23, a clinical bioequivalence study in healthy 
subjects and the pivotal safety study is NEPA-15-18 in cancer patients receiving up to 4 cycles of 
highly emetogenic chemotherapy with safety objectives the primary focus and secondary descriptive 
efficacy endpoints. 
The efficacy studies for this application are considered supportive with no pivotal efficacy study per se 
submitted as part of the clinical development plan. NEPA-15-18 consisted of chemotherapy naïve 
cancer patients who were starting a highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen. Patients were 
randomised to receive either the intravenous or oral formulation of Akynzeo and a corresponding 
placebo dummy. Patient were assessed for 4 cycles. The primary objectives were safety and tolerability 
and the secondary objective was to describe the efficacy using complete response, emetic episodes 
and nausea as endpoints during the acute, delayed and overall phases. However, the study was not 
powered for non-inferiority. 
PALO-15-17 was a non-inferiority study assessing the efficacy in the acute phase of intravenous 
Palonosetron infusion and bolus injection of Palonosetron in patients receiving highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy. Safety objectives were secondary. Safety data from two studies where intravenous 
fosnetupitant was administered alone in healthy volunteers (PNET-12-23, PNET-13-63) and one where 
intravenous palonosetron was administered alone (PALO-15-17) are considered supportive.    
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study PALO-15-17 demonstrated that palonosetron administered as a 30minute intravenous infusion 
was non-inferior in terms of both efficacy and safety to the 30 second bolus injection establishing that 
it can be used in combination with netupitant as an infusion.  
Specifically, this study demonstrated non-inferiority in terms of the proportion of patients reporting CR 
(defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue medication intake) in the acute phase as a primary 
efficacy objective and secondary endpoints included a) CR in the delayed and overall phases, b) the 
proportion of patients with no emetic episodes in the acute, delayed, and overall phases and c) the 
proportion of patients with no use of rescue medication in the acute, delayed, and overall phases. 
In the full analysis set, 186 (82.7%) patients in the infusion group reported CR in the acute phase, as 
did 186 (86.5%) patients in the bolus group. The difference in proportion between the 30-min infusion 
and 30-sec bolus treatment groups was -3.8% (99% CI: -12.2%, 4.7%). Since the lower limit of the 
two-sided 99% CI for the difference in proportions was greater (i.e., closer to zero) than the pre-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17373/2020  
Page 86/90 
 
 
 
defined non-inferiority margin of -15%, non-inferiority of palonosetron 30-min infusion vs. 30-sec 
bolus was demonstrated. The p-value associated with non-inferiority testing was <0.001. 
Study NEPA-15-18 demonstrated that there was comparable efficacy in terms of a complete response, 
absence of emetic episodes, absence of rescue medication and nausea control in the acute phase 
between the oral and intravenous FDC drug. In cycle 1, patients that had no emetic episodes for the 
overall phases were comparable between the two formulations IV 84.2% and oral 88.6% respectively. 
Noteworthy, bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the two formulations. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties about the favourable effects related to the introduction of the new 
pharmaceutical form and strength for intravenous use. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Of the 404 patients in the safety population in the pivotal safety study NEPA-15-18, 343 (84.9%) 
patients experienced at least one TEAE. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (i.e., those reported by > 5% of patients in either treatment 
group) were anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, constipation, nausea, asthenia, 
fatigue, ALT increased, AST increased, blood creatinine increased, decreased appetite, alopecia, 
headache, and hypertension. 
Overall, 47 (11.6%) and 120 (29.7%) patients experienced exclusively mild and moderate (Grades 1 
and 2) events, respectively. These events were reported in similar numbers of patients in both 
treatment groups (Grade 1: 23 [11.3%] patients in the IV NEPA and 24 [11.9%] patients in the Oral 
NEPA group; Grade 2: 60 [29.6%] patients and 60 [29.9%] in the IV NEPA and Oral NEPA groups, 
respectively). The pattern of mild and moderate events reflected the overall AE profile of the study; 
events occurred most frequently in the following SOCs and PTs: Blood and Lymphatic System 
Disorders (neutropenia, anaemia), Gastrointestinal SOC (nausea, constipation), General Disorders 
(asthenia, fatigue), and Investigations (AST, ALT and Creatinine increased). 
Overall, Grade 3 TEAEs were experienced by 61 (30.0%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 54 
(26.9%) patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group, and Grade 4 TEAEs were experienced by 15 (7.4%) 
patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 22 (10.9%) patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group.  As expected, 
neutropenia was the most frequent Grade 3/4 TEAE reported during this study (37 [18.2%] patients in 
the IV NEPA FDC group and 37 [18.4%] patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group).  Severe TEAEs were 
reported for 86 (42.4%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 90 (44.8%) patients in the Oral NEPA 
FDC group. For IV NEPA FDC, 2 patients (1.0%) experienced severe TEAEs related to study drug and 3 
patients (1.5%) experienced severe TEAEs related to dexamethasone. For Oral NEPA FDC, 3 patients 
(1.5%) experienced severe TEAEs related to study drug and 6 patients (3.0%) experienced severe 
TEAEs related to dexamethasone. 
The only two events reported in more than 2% of patients in both treatment groups were constipation 
and ALT increases.  Constipation (an adverse event of special interest in this study) was reported by 
13 [6.4%] patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 12 [6.0%] patients in the oral NEPA FDC group and 
ALT increases were experienced by 4 patients (2.0%) in each treatment group. 
TEAEs related to study drug were reported for 26 (12.8%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and for 
23 (11.4%) patients in the oral NEPA FDC group. Frequency and type of TEAEs were similar in the two 
treatment groups.   
Assessment report

TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported for 16 (7.9%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group 
and 20 (10.0%) patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group. 
TEAEs leading to death were reported for 10 (4.9%) patients in the IV NEPA FDC group and 14 (7.0%) 
patients in the Oral NEPA FDC group.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Results from clinical study PALO-15-17 showed that 30-minute IV infusion of palonosetron 0.25 mg is 
non-inferior to a 30-second bolus in patients receiving a highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen.   
The descriptive efficacy results presented in NEPA-15-18 demonstrate comparable control of acute 
phase CINV in patients receiving HEC between the oral formulation and the intravenous infusion. The 
results are maintained for the 4 cycles examined. These results are considered to be clinically 
important and support the overall bioequivalence PK/PD bridging approach taken with this application. 
From a PK standpoint, the chosen dose of 260 mg fosnetupitant is justified and results in Netupitant 
exposures are similar to the ones observed with the oral 300 mg netupitant dose already authorised 
and marketed. The absence of a powered non-inferiority study comparing NEPA IV FDC to NEPA PO

FDC does not allow to draw any firm conclusion regarding the efficacy of the prevention of nausea and 
vomiting during the delayed phase in patients receiving highly emetic chemotherapy. However, as the 
intravenous formulation is regarded as bioequivalent to the oral formulation, therefore the efficacy of 
IV NEPA FDC can be considered acceptable and overall similar. 
No new safety issues have been identified, in overall the safety profile is in line with the well known 
safety of the oral formulation.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Since the intravenous formulation is regarded as bioequivalent and non-inferior to the oral formulation, 
therefore the efficacy of IV NEPA FDC can be considered acceptable and in line with the already known 
efficacy of the oral Akynzeo. 
The CHMP considers that the safety profile of the IV NEPA FDC has been shown to be similar to the 
approved oral NEPA FDC Akynzeo.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Akynzeo powder for concentrate for solution for infusion’ of fosnetupitant and 
palonosetron of 235 mg/0.25 mg, to be administered intravenously is positive in the approved 
indications. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Akynzeo 235 mg/0.25 mg, powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion for intravenous use is favourable in adult patients in the following indication:  
- 
- 
Prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic 
cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. 
Prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic 
cancer chemotherapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Akynzeo subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

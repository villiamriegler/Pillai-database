are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Cablivi 
and PL 
in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
The PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template. The 
statement that this medicinal product is subject to 
additional monitoring and that this will allow quick 
identification of new safety information, preceded by an 
inverted equilateral black triangle, is removed from the 
summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  
Bleeding 
Cablivi increases the risk of bleeding. Cases of major 
bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding have 
been reported in patients receiving caplacizumab, mainly in 
those using concomitant anti-platelet agents or 
anticoagulants. Caplacizumab should be used with caution 
in patients with underlying conditions that may predispose 
them to a higher risk of bleeding 
In case of clinically significant bleeding, treatment with 
Cablivi should be interrupted. If needed, the use of von 
Willebrand Factor concentrate could be considered to 
correct hemostasis. Cablivi should only be restarted upon 
the advice of a physician experienced in the management 
of thrombotic microangiopathies. If Cablivi is restarted, 
monitor closely for signs of bleeding. 
In the setting of concomitant use of oral anticoagulants, 
anti-platelet agents or heparin  
The risk of bleeding is increased with concomitant use of 
Cablivi with drugs affecting hemostasis and coagulation. 
Page 4/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initiation or continuation of treatment with oral 
anticoagulants (e.g., vitamin K antagonists or direct oral 
anticoagulants [DOAC] such as thrombin inhibitors or factor 
Xa inhibitors), anti-platelet agents or heparin requires a 
careful consideration and close clinical monitoring.  
In patients with coagulopathies 
Due to a potential increased risk of bleeding, use of Cablivi 
in patients with underlying coagulopathies (e.g. hemophilia, 
other coagulation factor deficiencies) must be accompanied 
by close clinical monitoring. 
In patients undergoing surgery 
If a patient is to undergo elective surgery, an invasive 
dental procedure or other invasive interventions, the 
patient must be advised to inform the physician or dentist 
that they are using caplacizumab and it is recommended to 
withhold treatment for at least 7 days before the planned 
intervention. The patient must also notify the physician 
who supervises the treatment with caplacizumab about the 
planned procedure. After the risk of surgical bleeding has 
resolved, and caplacizumab is resumed, the patient should 
be monitored closely for signs of bleeding. 
If emergency surgery is needed, the use of von Willebrand 
Factor concentrate is recommended to correct hemostasis.

Product Characteristics.

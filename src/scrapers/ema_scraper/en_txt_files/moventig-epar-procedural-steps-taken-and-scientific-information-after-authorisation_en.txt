1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

This variation concerns the final study report of the 
Post Authorization Safety Study (PASS)- Drug 
Utilisation in Selected European Populations 
(D3820R00006), listed as a category 3 study in the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP). The RMP version 7.1 is 
accepted. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
observational Post-authorization Safety Study (PASS) 
D3820R00006, to describe the utilization of naloxegol 
within a cohort of adult patients with opioid induced 
constipation (OIC). 
This study data provided insights into the demographics of 
naloxegol users, the utilisation of naloxegol in the general 
population (United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden and 
Germany) population with contraindications, potential off-
label use, and the use in vulnerable/special populations

(patients aged ≥65 years; pregnant; patients with prior 
cardiovascular disease; patients with prior renal or hepatic 
impairment; patients with concurrent methadone use; and 
patients with concurrent use of cytochrome P450 [CYP] 3A 
inhibitors/inducers or P-glycoprotein [Pgp] modulators). 
Overall, no new safety concerns were raised in this study. 
The RMP is updated accordingly (version 7.1) to remove 
reference to study D3820R00006.

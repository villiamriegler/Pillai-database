2.  Scientific discussion 
• 
Introduction 
Anagrelide hydrochloride (Xagrid)  is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphidiesterase III and is indicated 
for the reduction of elevated platelet counts in at risk essential thrombocythaemia (ET) patients who 
are intolerant to their current therapy or whose elevated platelet counts are not reduced to an 
acceptable level by their current therapy. 
An at risk patient 
An at risk essential thrombocythaemia patient is defined by one or more of the following features:  
•  > 60 years of age or  
• 
• 
a platelet count > 1000 x 109/l or  
a history of thrombo-haemorrhagic events. 
The specific mechanism of action by which anagrelide reduces platelet count is not yet fully understood 
although it has been confirmed that anagrelide is platelet selective from in vitro and in vivo study 
information. In vitro studies of human megakaryocytopoiesis established that anagrelide’s inhibitory 
actions on platelet formation in man are mediated via retardation of maturation of megakaryocytes, 
and reducing their size and ploidy. Following oral administration, anagrelide is rapidly absorbed and 
extensively metabolized to form a pharmacologically active metabolite, BCH24426 (3-hydroxy-
anagrelide), which is further metabolized to the major pharmacologically inactive metabolite, RL603. In 
healthy subjects, less than 1% of the anagrelide dose is recovered in urine as unchanged anagrelide 
and approximately 3% and 16–20% is recovered in urine as BCH24426 and RL603, respectively. 
Xagrid was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/00/010 on 29 December 2000. The 
Marketing Authorisation for Xagrid remains under exceptional circumstances. 
The MAH applied for a variation to the Xagrid (anagrelide hydrochloride) marketing authorisation 
(EU/1/04/295/001) to change the indication and include the use in paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 
years. The proposed indication was as follows: 
Xagrid is indicated for the reduction of elevated platelet counts in: 
- adult at-risk essential thrombocythaemia (ET) patients 
- children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with ET who are intolerant to their current therapy or 
whose elevated platelet counts are not reduced to an acceptable level by their current therapy. 
This application was made following the completion of Paediatric Investigation Plan in March 2013 
(EMEA-000720-PIP01-09-M02). A waiver was granted for paediatric patients under 6 years of age. 
Shire  submitted  a  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  on  a  voluntary  basis  under  Article  8  of  the 
Paediatric Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 with a view to obtaining a 2-year extension to the marketing 
exclusivity  of  Xagrid  in  the  EU.    The  PIP  was  agreed  with  the  EMA  on  4  June  2010.  The  indication 
targeted by the PIP was as follows: 
Treatment  of  essential  thrombocythaemia  (ET)  in  paediatric  patients  aged  6  to  less  than  18 
years  who  are  intolerant  to  their  current  therapy  or  whose  elevated  platelet  counts  are  not 
reduced to an acceptable level by their current therapy.

Three clinical measures were agreed for the completion of the PIP: 
• 
Retrospective  analysis  of  pooled  data  from  studies  SPD422-202  and  SPD422-203  to 
compare PK/PD parameters across the age groups 6-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-64 years and ≥
65 years SPD-422-405a 
A  retrospective  analysis  of  pooled  safety  data  from  patients  aged  <18  years  of  age 
• 
from studies available in the Shire anagrelide clinical database – Study SPD422-405b. 
Multicentre  paediatric  observational  study  in  Essential  Thrombocythaemia  (ET), 
• 
evaluating  drug  utilisation  and  effects  of  cytoreductive  agents  treatment  in  children  6  to  less 
than 18 years of age - Study SPD422-404 
Study SPD422-202 was submitted in April 2005 with the Type II variation application 
EMEA/H/C/480/II/01 and resulted in an update to the XAGRID SmPC Sections 5.1 and 5.2 but not a 
paediatric indication. The CHMP concluded that the data were insufficient to support a dosage 
recommendation in paediatrics and the efficacy below the age of 16 years was not yet established. 
Study could provide safety information and provide guidance on the identification of an appropriate 
dose for the paediatric indication.  
As agreed, a data cut was performed at the completion date of the PIP and core part of the SPD422-
404 study in March 2013 and the results from this interim data cut were submitted for this variation. 
Long-term safety and efficacy are being collected from subjects enrolled in the SPD422-404 registry 
study during an additional one year follow-up. This long-term follow-up is outside of the PIP. 
Study  SPD422-404  (a  multi-centre,  paediatric,  observational  study  in  essential  thrombocythaemia 
(ET), to assess drug utilisation and effects of cytoreductive treatment) that was specifically focused on 
paediatric  population  was  initiated  and  additional  pooled  analyses  on  the  existing  clinical  database 
(SPD422-405a & 405b) was undertaken in accordance with a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) agreed 
on  4  June  2010  with  the  Paediatric  Committee  of  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA-000720-
PIP01-09).  
The study SPD422-404 was not completed by March 2013 (the agreed date of completion of the PIP). 
The modification allowed the applicant to complete the core part of the study  within the  PIP  when at 
least  30  patients  had  one-year  follow-up.  The  second  part  of  the  registry  study  is  outside  of  the  PIP 
and part of the specific measures for long-term follow-up. The PDCO opinion on the modified PIP was 
adopted  on  the  6th  December  2013  and  the  decision  included  a  waiver  for  children  aged  less  than  6 
years. 
A data cut was performed at the completion date of the PIP and core part of the SPD422-404 study in 
March 2013 and the results from this data cut were submitted in support for the variation. 
In addition, as per opinion of the Paediatric committee on the agreement of the PIP, the applicant was 
requested to perform a retrospective analysis of pool studies SPD422-202 and SPD422-203 in order to 
compare pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics parameters across the age groups 6-11 years, 12-17 
years, 18-64 years and ≥65 years. Therefore, Shire proposed a reanalysis of existing PK and safety 
data using a reclassification into ICH age groups. 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) proposed updates to the following sections of the Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL) : 4.1 Therapeutic indications, 4.2  Posology 
and method of administration, Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, 4.8 Undesirable 
effects, 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties, and  5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties.

Study SPD422-203 also used the licensed 0.5 mg capsules of anagrelide in young adult (18-50 years) 
versus elderly (≥65 years) ET patients. 
Study SPD422-405a 
Study SPD422-405a is a retrospective analysis of pooled data from studies SPD422-202 and SPD422-
203. It examined PK/PD data across defined age groups from age 6 years to the elderly after 30 days 
of treatment. 
The objectives of the study were to compare PK, PD, and safety outcomes across defined age groups 
from age 6 years to the elderly. 
The efficacy primary endpoints were:  
• 
• 
Treatment history 
Platelet count 
o  At screening and after 4 weeks of treatment (i.e. Day 30 for study 202 and 10-12 
hours post-dose on Day 1 for study 203). 
•  Dose of anagrelide 
o  Change from first to last dose 
o  Average dose during the 4-week study/evaluation window 
•  Duration of exposure to anagrelide 
The secondary endpoint was Safety 
•  Adverse events (based on the 4-week evaluation window) 
Pharmacokinetics (anagrelide and BCH24426 metabolite) 
•  Dose-normalised AUCτ (AUC over the dosing interval) 
•  Dose-normalised Cmax 
•  Clearance (dose/AUC) 
•  Weight-normalised clearance 
Secondary endpoints were adverse events. 
The statistical plan included the summaries of demography, treatment history, anagrelide dosing, 
pharmacokinetics parameters (AUCт, clearance, weight-normalised clearance, Cmax), platelet count 
(at the start and end of 4 weeks treatment), exposure, and adverse events were presented. 
A total of 8 children (6-11 years), 10 adolescents (12-17 years), 17 adults (18-64 years), and 24 
elderly (≥ 65 years) were entered in this retrospective analysis.  
The majority of subjects had previously been treated with cytoreductives, of which anagrelide was the 
most frequently administered. 
In the paediatric children and adolescents, only 1 subject had previously been treated with 
antiaggregants and none with anti-coagulants.

The  pooled  analysis  for  Studies  SPD422-202  and  SPD422-203  (Study  SPD422-405a)  examined  for 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data for 8 children, 10 adolescents, 17 adults, and 24 elderly 
subjects of anagrelide and its active metabolite BCH24426 (3-hydroxy-anagrelide). The ET subjects in 
this  pooled  analysis  were  receiving  individualised  dosing  regimens  of  anagrelide  administered  at 
different  doses  and  different  dosing  intervals  (potentially  2,  3,  or  4  times  daily).  The  results  are 
presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and 2. The dosage regimen for study SPD422-202 was a start dose 
of  0.5-2mg/day,  titrated  up  to  a  maximum  of  10mg/day  and  for  study  SPD422-203  the  Subjects 
received their usual daily anagrelide dose, divided as evenly as possible into a twice daily regimen. The

2.2.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The data for platelet counts were pooled from the two phase II clinical SPD422-202 and SPD422-203 
studies in order to compare them across different age groups. However, pediatric patients were only 
enrolled in Study SPD422-202 and methodological differences in PD assessments in the two studies do 
not allow appropriate comparisons.  In particular, patients in Study SPD422-202 received the 
treatment for 4 weeks were at an anagrelide PK steady-state at the time of sampling whereas patients 
in study SPD422-203 received the treatment for 1 day.  Therefore the ‘baseline’ measure was taken 
within 5 minutes prior to dosing on PK sampling day and shows the effects of regular anagrelide 
administration in patients receiving a stable anagrelide dose. The ‘week 4’ timepoint for patients from 
Study SPD422-203 corresponds to 12 hours post-dose on the PK sampling day. Therefore, neither 
‘baseline’ nor ‘week 4’ platelet counts could be compared between different age groups.

In addition to assessments of baseline platelet count and platelet count changes following anagrelide 
dose adjustments, the relationship of anagrelide and its active metabolite BCH24426 plasma levels 
with the vasodilatory and positive inotropic effects observed with the drug were explored in the Study 
SPD422-202 and assessed in 2005. In the Study SPD422-202, significant positive correlations were 
identified between maximal increases in heart rate and corresponding maximum plasma concentrations 
of anagrelide and the metabolite BCH24426. However, these relationships were no longer statistically 
significant when the data were analyzed by subject age group. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The paediatric patients enrolled in the studies had a prior exposure to Xagrid and therefore the 
relevance of ‘baseline’ data in assessing the effect of Xagrid on platelet count is of concern. Therefore, 
the pooled analysis of the data from studies SPD422-202 and SPD422-203 was not considered robust 
and does not allow for an accurate and reliable assessment of PK and PD data in children. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP agreed to include the following wording in section 5.2 of the SmPC on the 
exposure of anagrelide in children: 
Pharmacokinetic data from exposed fasting children and adolescents (age range 7 - 16 years) with 
essential thrombocythaemia indicate that dose normalised exposure, Cmax and AUC, of anagrelide 
tended to be higher in children/adolescents compared with adults. There was also a trend to higher 
dose-normalised exposure to the active metabolite.

Methods 
Study SPD422-404 Interim Analysis at PIP Completion 
SPD422-404 is a multicentre, open-label, non-interventional, observational registry study, conducted 
to observe disease progression, symptoms and treatment effects on platelet count in children aged 6 
to less than 18 years of age with a diagnosis of ET. It is currently ongoing to collect long-term safety 
and efficacy data. In addition, drug utilization data for anagrelide and other treatments for ET, and the 
incidence and severity of AEs were described. Treatment was administered according to the usual 
medical clinical practice of paediatric hematologists and their decisions in treating children. Due to its 
non-interventional design, this study did not employ any form of randomization, stratification, blinding 
or control cohorts. Further, there was no established schedule of assessments, and data were only 
provided if an assessment had occurred as part of routine clinical practice, and at the discretion of the 
treating physician. This study therefore provides data describing standard treatment of ET in children 
across Europe. 
The clinical study report provided in this application presents a planned interim analysis with a data cut 
date of 13 Mar 2013 which is the agreed completion date of the PIP. 
This study planned to recruit at least 60 ET subjects during the enrolment period up to March 2013 
who, according to the treating physician, had ET using the WHO criteria.  
Subjects could be enrolled regardless of ET therapy, i.e., they could be: 
- Previously treated 
- Currently being treated or 
- Not receiving ET therapy / treatment-naive.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is platelet count (pre-treated, titration and treatment targets). A 
summary of the platelet count included n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum at each visit. It 
was anticipated that platelet count data would be collected at frequent intervals to monitor the disease.

Results  
Study SPD422-404 Interim Analysis at PIP Completion 
Within the planned recruitment target, at least 30 subjects were required to have at least one year’s 
data by the PIP completion date. This interim analysis includes 69 subjects who had been enrolled at 
the time of the data cut and PIP completion date of March 2013. 
Of the 69 subjects included in the study at the time of data cut, approximately one-third of subjects 
were aged 6-11 years, with the remainder aged 12-17 years. Mean (SD) age was 12.4 (3.26) years. 
Just over half of subjects (59.4%) were female and the majority (75.4%) was white. 
At the time of the data cut for this interim analysis, of the 69 subjects included in the study, 56 
subjects (81%) had been observed for more than 1 year. Mean (SD) subject duration in the study was 
506.2 (178.01) days. The median duration of observation was 492 days (range: 58, 898 days). 
Participant flow 
Table 6 shows patient disposition for study SPD422-404.  
During the observation period, out of 69 patients,  
- 53 were under no treatment or anti-agregant alone of whom 3 switched to cytoreductive therapy (2 
to Xagrid, 1 to hydroxycarbamide);

- 14 were under cytoreductive therapy Xagrid® either in combination (3) or as monotherapy (11); 
- 5 were under cytoreductive therapy, excluding Xagrid®, either in combination with other treatment 
of ET or as monotherapy; of these 4 were treated with hydroxycarbamide and 1 with interferon alpha 
2A.

Conduct of the study 
Treatment switching was relatively infrequent during the study. During the observation period, 3 of the 
53 subjects (5.7%) in the No Treatment/A-A Alone cohort switched to other cytoreductive therapy of 
whom 2 subjects (3.8%) switched to anagrelide and 1 subject (1.9%) switched to hydroxycarbamide. 
No subjects switched from other cytoreductive therapy to anagrelide. Notably, 17 subjects were 
identified as having taken anagrelide as first-line therapy since diagnosis.

Within the planned recruitment target, at least 30 subjects were required to have at least one year’s 
data by the PIP completion date. This interim analysis included 69 subjects who had been enrolled at 
the time of the data cut and PIP completion date of March 2013. 
Of the 69 subjects included in the study at the time of data cut, approximately one-third of subjects 
were aged 6-11 years, with the remainder aged 12-17 years. Mean (SD) age was 12.4 (3.26) years. 
Just over half of subjects (59.4%) were female and the majority (75.4%) was white. 
At the time of the data cut for this interim analysis, of the 69 subjects included in the study, 56 
subjects (81%) had been observed for more than 1 year. Mean (SD) subject duration in the study was 
506.2 (178.01) days. The median duration of observation was 492 days (range: 58, 898 days). 
Numbers analysed 
Between diagnosis and start of observation, patients received cytoreductive treatment mostly 
anagrelide and/or hydroxycarbamide. Of 18 patients identified as having taken anagrelide, 14 received 
it as first cytoreductive treatment. As well, of 18 patients identified as having taken hydroxycarbamide, 
16 received it as first cytoreductive treatment. During the observation period, 19 subjects (27.5%) 
received cytoreductive therapy, of whom 14 subjects were treated with anagrelide at a median dose of 
1 mg, and 6 subjects were treated with hydroxycarbamide at a median dose of 975 mg. Note that 
individual subjects may be counted in more than 1 treatment cohort due to treatment switching.  
Of the 19 subjects who did not receive cytoreductive ET therapy, 18 subjects received salicylic acid at 
a median dose of 81.3 mg.

Platelet counts 
Essential thrombocythaemia symptoms and side effects are plotted against median platelet count for 
subjects receiving no treatment/A-A alone in Figure 4, cytoreductive therapy in Figure 5, and 
anagrelide in Figure 6. The overall incidence of symptoms and side effects was low.

Interim results 
As would be expected, median platelet counts at diagnosis were elevated in all treatment cohorts 
(1227. 109/L in the no treatment/A-A alone cohort, 1077. 109/L in the cytoreductive therapy cohort, 
and 1097. 109/L in the anagrelide cohort).  
By baseline, median platelet counts had substantially decreased (778. 109/L in the no treatment/A-A 
alone cohort, 477. 109/L in the cytoreductive therapy cohort, and 476. 109/L in the anagrelide cohort). 
Assessment report

Page 24/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thereafter, platelet counts were maintained for both the cytoreductive therapy and anagrelide cohorts, 
whereas platelet counts in the no treatment/A-A alone cohort generally remained at elevated levels of 
around 1000. 109/L. 
During observation period, reasons for change or dose modification of medication were failure to reach 
platelet objective. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
SPD422-405a Pooled Analysis 
A total of 59 subjects were included in this pooled analysis from 2 studies: Study SPD422-202 and 
Study SPD422-203. A summary of platelet count at screening and after 4 weeks treatment is 
presented Figure 7. 
Median platelet count at screening was substantially higher for children (813,5. 109/L) than any other 
age group, ranging from median values of 390. 109/L for elderly subjects to 544. 109/L for adolescents.  
Marked reductions were seen in children and adolescents after 4 weeks of treatment, and median 
values were below 500. 109/L by Week 4 for all age groups.

In total, 16 subjects were included in this pooled analysis from 3 studies: Study 700-014, Study13970-
301, and Study 700-999. Of these 16, 7 subjects were children (aged 6-11 years) and 9 subjects were

adolescents (aged 12-17 years). There was a slightly greater proportion of females amongst 
adolescents (6 subjects, 66.7%) compared to children (3 subjects, 42.9%). 
The majority of subjects in both groups were White. The majority of subjects were treatment naïve, 
with just 2 children (28.6%) and 1 adolescent (11.1%) having undergone previous treatment for ET. 
The median average total daily dose was 0.87 mg (range; 0.6 to 3.5mg) for children and 3.01 mg 
(range; 1.1 to 5.6 mg) for adolescents. Anagrelide dosing information was unavailable for 1 child and 1 
adolescent. 
A summary of platelet count at baseline, ≤13 weeks, 13 weeks to <1 year, 1 to <2 years, 2 to <4 
years, 4 to <6 years, and 6 to <8 years for children and adolescents included in the integrated analysis 
developed in 2002 is presented in Figure 8.

summary of safety studies)  –  Study SPD422-405b 
Apart from the pharmacodynamic results, this study informs on overall exposure to anagrelide. Five 
children and 7 adolescents were exposed to anagrelide for more than 6 months (duration of exposure 
was missing for 2 subjects). Median exposure was higher for children (2.33 years) as compared to 
adolescents (1.57 years). 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
SPD422-405a study, which pools SPD422-202 and SPD422-203 studies, was designed to extend Pk/PD 
Assessment report

Page 26/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information for paediatric patients (demography, treatment history), anagrelide dosing, PK parameters, 
exposure, and adverse events. As study SPD422-203 did not enrol any child or adolescent, the pooling 
of  both  studies  did  not  increase  the  sample  size  of  the  paediatric  population.  Efficacy  data  i.e., 
reduction of platelet count in paediatric patients come exclusively from SPD422-202 study.  
The CHMP had major concerns over some methodological issues from the pivotal study SPD422-404. 
The majority of paediatric patients were already on anagrelide treatment at study entry (an average of 
2 years) which limited the clinical data on the starting dose recommendation for paediatric patients. In 
the retrospective review of patients’ records in the study, the total daily starting dose appeared to be 
lower (0.75 mg to 1.5 mg per day) in paediatric patients, as well as in adult patients (0.5 mg to 2.0 
mg per day), than the currently recommended starting dose (2 mg per day as given by 0.5 mg qid or 1 
mg bid) for adult patients. However, the study was limited by the number of patients available and a 
retrospective review of data for starting doses. Median platelet counts were substantially reduced from 
diagnosis for the duration of the observation period in subjects receiving cytoreductive therapy but 
remained elevated for subjects who received no treatment or A-A alone, as expected.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Reductions in platelet counts were seen in children and adolescents after 4 weeks of treatment but it 
should be noted that previous exposure to anagrelide in all age groups confounds the interpretation of 
these  results.  Consequently,  SPD422-405a  study  is  unlikely  to  bring  new  efficacy  information 
(compared to isolated SPD422-202) related to anagrelide in paediatric patients.   
SPD422-405b  study,  a  study  designed  to  evaluate  safety,  provides  confirmatory  data  on  the 
pharmacodynamic activity of anagrelide in reducing platelet counts in children and adolescents. It was 
observed that median average total daily dose was lower for children as compared to adolescents. 
The reporting of the paediatric data was not satisfactory, giving rise to outstanding issues that were 
not completely resolved. Response to anagrelide was defined in adults as a decrease in platelet count 
to ≤600. 109/l or a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline and maintenance of the reduction for at least 4 
weeks. For paediatric patients, titration to maintain platelet count was performed according to 
standard adult recommendations. However, a platelet count target or an optimal duration for 
anagrelide treatment was not predefined and there were no stopping rules based on efficacy concerns. 
Another issue raised was the concern over compliance to treatment. The CHMP had concerns over the 
pharmaceutical form (hard capsule) as the capsules cannot be crushed or diluted in a liquid and might 
not be adapted to children who cannot swallow capsules.  
The paediatric population in the observational study enrolled only 14 Xagrid-treated patients which is a 
very limited size of population. There were a minority of patients that were treatment naive before 
registration but most had received prior medication i.e. administered between diagnosis and baseline 
which can confound the data. Most of those who were treated with cytoreductive therapy were given 
Xagrid or hydroxycarbamide as their initial cytoreductive therapy. Notably, 34 out of 69 (49.3%) 
patients did receive a cytoreductive therapy including Xagrid from diagnosis to start of observation. 18 
subjects were identified as having taken Xagrid as first-line therapy since diagnosis.  
Only15 subjects (21.7%) reported any concomitant medication, with most medications reported for 1 
subject only; there was no discernible pattern of clinical relevance with regard to the administration of 
concomitant medications.

2.3.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  results  from  the  pivotal  observational  study  SPD422-404  supported  by  the  results  of  the  pooled 
studies  SPD422-202  and  SPD  422-203  (SPD422-405a)  did  not  provide  satisfactory  evidence  on  the 
benefit  of  anagrelide  treatment  in  the  paediatric  population  of  6-18  years  with  ET.  Moreover,  the 
threshold for platelet count for starting anagrelide treatment as well as a recommended posology could 
not  be  clearly  defined  from  the  analyses  submitted.  There  were  several  methodological  issues  that 
raised major concerns which could not be resolved during the procedure. Therefore, the CHMP is of the 
opinion  that  the  indication  for  “the  reduction  of  elevated  platelet  counts  in  children  and  adolescents 
aged 6-17 years with ET who are intolerant to their current therapy or whose elevated platelet counts 
are  not  reduced to  an  acceptable  level  by  their  current  therapy”  is  not  supported  by  the  clinical  data 
submitted.  However,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  information  from  the  paediatric  population  was 
relevant to healthcare professionals specialised in treating ET patients and agreed to include the results 
of the studies in section 4.2 and section 5.1 of the SmPC 
2.4.  Clinical safety

A summary of overall exposure to anagrelide for children and adolescents included in the integrated 
analysis developed in 2002 is presented in Table 9, based on length of time since first dose of 
anagrelide (pre-study if the subject was not treatment-naïve) to last dose in study.

SPD422-404 Interim Analysis at PIP Completion 
Approximately one-third of subjects were aged 6-11 years, with the remainder aged 12-17 years. 
Mean (SD) age was 12.4 (3.26) years. Just over half of subjects (59.4%) were female and the majority 
(75.4%) was White. 
SPD422-405a 
Of the 59 subjects included in the analysis, 8 (13.6%) were children, 10 (16.9%) were adolescents, 17 
(28.8%) were adults and 24 (40.7%) were elderly. Subject age ranged from 7 to 86 years. 
SPD422-405b 
Of the 16 subjects included in the analysis, 7 (43.8%) were children and 9 (56.3%) were adolescents. 
Subject age ranged from 5 to 17 years. It should be noted that 1 subject aged 5 years was included. 
Although this subject fell outside the age category for children (6-11 years), the subject was retained 
in the pooled analysis in order to include all available paediatric data. 
There was a slightly greater proportion of females amongst adolescents (6 subjects, 66.7%) as 
compared to children (3 subjects, 42.9%). The majority of subjects in both groups were White. The 
majority of subjects were treatment-naïve, with just 2 children (28.6%) and 1 adolescent (11.1%) had 
undergone previous treatment for ET.

Since SPD422-203 did not include paediatric patients, SPD422-405a safety findings come down to 
results of SPD422-202. Based on SPD422-202 safety findings, the MAH states that the type of events 
reported as related to study drug were similar between the paediatric/adolescent (palpitations, 
headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, anorexia, fatigue and muscle cramps) and 
adolescent/adult (tachycardia, palpitations, headache, dizziness, dyspnoea, nausea, abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea, oedema peripheral and vascular skin condition) groups. 
For SPD422-405 study, adverse events reported within the 30-day window are presented by MedDRA 
system organ class and preferred term for the pooled studies in Table 11.

The most common AE reported for the pooled studies was headache, reported by 1 child, 1 adolescent 
and 2 adults; there were no reports of headache in elderly subjects. 
Epistaxis was reported by 3 subjects; 1 child, 1 adolescent, and 1 adult. Epistaxis is an uncommon 
adverse drug reaction associated with anagrelide.

Palpitations were reported in 2 elderly subjects and fatigue was reported in 1 adolescent and 1 elderly 
subject.  
Palpitations and fatigue are common adverse drug reactions associated with anagrelide. No other AE 
was reported by more than 1 subject during the 30-day window. 
The overall incidence of AEs was higher in children (50%) than with any other age group (20-25%). 
The events reported in children were toothache, pyrexia, viral pharyngitis, viral infection, deliberate 
poisoning (inhalation of lighter gases), headache, epistaxis, and rhinorrhoea. 
SPD422-405b 
Adverse events reported in children and adolescents included in the integrated analysis developed in 
2002 are presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term for the pooled studies in Table

The overall incidence of AEs was lower in children (57%) than with adolescents (89%). 
The most common AE reported in paediatric subjects included in the integrated analysis were 
headache (1/7 children, 4/9 adolescents), fatigue (2/7 children, 1/9 adolescent). Palpitations, nausea, 
pyrexia, syncope, depression NEC, and epistaxis were all reported in 2 subjects. Palpitations and 
nausea are common adverse drug reactions and are expected, based on the pharmacology of 
anagrelide. Syncope, depression and epistaxis are listed as uncommon adverse drug reactions. All 
other AEs were reported in no more than 1 subject. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in Study SPD422-404 or in the pooled analysis SPD422-405a.  
Two subjects of <18 years in the long-term Study 13,970-301, which was included in the pooled 
analysis SPD422-405b, developed serious AEs (SAEs) leading to death. 
Subject 0003 was a 17-year-old white female, weighing 43 kg, with essential thrombocythemia. The 
date of diagnosis was unknown, but the subject started hydroxyurea therapy in Feb 1992. She had 
numerous medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, recurrent pulmonary embolism, drug-related 
seizures and chronic pancreatitis. She had also undergone a splenectomy and was immunosuppressed 
following liver transplant, secondary to Budd Chiari syndrome. The subject received anagrelide 
between 18 Mar 1992 and 10 Jun 1996. During this period, she was also taking procardia, cyclosporine, 
pen V, prednisolone, heparin, insulin and pancrease. The subject died in ICU on 10 Jun 1996 from 
sepsis, due to enteroccocus faecium, found to be positive in ascitic aspirate. She had multi-organ 
failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The investigator assessed the event to be unrelated to 
anagrelide treatment. 
Subject 3326 was a 17-year-old white male, weighing 43 kg, with essential thrombocythemia. The 
date of diagnosis was Feb 1996. The subject was treated with hydroxyurea for 3 months, but this failed

to reduce his platelet levels. He presented with recurrent pulmonary emboli and was receiving 
coumadin. In May 1997 the subject died due to myocardial infarction. It is not known whether the 
investigator attributed this to anagrelide, but compliance with the drug was apparently very poor. The 
last platelet level available was in Mar 1997 of 466. 109/L. Further information for this subject was 
unavailable. 
Other serious adverse events 
There were no other significant AEs reported in either SPD422-405a or SPD422-405b studies. 
As for SPD422-404 Interim Analysis at PIP Completion, one subject in the cytoreductive therapy cohort 
developed a thrombohaemorrhagic event of cerebral venous thrombosis during the observation period. 
No other thrombohaemorrhagic events were reported during this study. The investigator considered 
this SAE unrelated to cytoreductive therapy. 
Two subjects were determined to have experienced disease progression, of whom 1 was in the No 
Treatment/A-A Alone cohort (Subject 041-0002, myelofibrosis) and 1 had switched from No Treatment 
/A-A Alone cohort to the cytoreductive therapy cohort (Subject 031-0001). The latter subject was 
reported as having iron deficiency while in the No Treatment/A-A Alone cohort and splenomegaly while 
in cytoreductive therapy cohort. No subjects in the Xagrid cohort experienced disease progression. 
Neither subject exhibited symptoms at diagnosis, and only 1 exhibited symptoms during the study. Of 
these subjects, 041-0002 had a platelet count at diagnosis of 1378. 109/L. 
Four subjects reported any symptom of ET during the observation period. Single subject incidences of 
splenomegaly, gingival disorder, contusion, paraesthesia, and headache were reported. Events for 3 
subjects were reported under the No Treatment/A-A Alone cohort and for 1 subject under the 
Cytoreductive Therapy cohort. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory parameters abnormalities 
There was no report of laboratory parameters abnormalities in SPD422-405a or SPD422-405a studies 
since laboratory parameters were not collected in these analyses. 
As for SPD422-404 Interim Analysis at PIP Completion, no AEs were associated with clinical laboratory 
abnormalities except 1 non-serious event of blood fibrinogen decreased. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In total, the paediatric safety population was very limited with only14 paediatric patients in study 
SPD422-404 study (4 children/10 adolescents), 18 paediatric patients in study SPD422-405a (8 
children/10 adolescents) and 14 paediatric patients in study in SPD422-405b (7 children/9 
adolescents). The median overall exposure was shorter in SPD422-404 than SPD422-405a or SPD422-
405b studies.  
In SPD422-404, 16 out of 59 patients experienced any adverse event related or not to ET treatment. 
The majority of AEs occurred in the no treatment/A-A alone cohort. Some AEs, which were not cited in 
the adult population, were reported in paediatric population in system organ class such as injury 
poisoning, infections and infestations or reproductive system and breast disorders. Drug related 
adverse reactions like headache, nausea, diarrhoea, which are described in the adult population were 
also reported in the paediatric population. Palpitations and hypotension were reported in paediatric

patients. Other cardiovascular events like tachycardia, prolonged QT interval, torsades de pointes were 
not reported. As SPD422-404 results come from an interim analysis, final CSR is expected to gather 
long term safety data. A warning on the need to monitor and assess cardiac, hepatic and renal 
functions is included in the SmPC in section 4.4. 
The transformation of ET to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was not investigated and 
no cases were identified in the study population. However, this is a concern especially in children and 
adolescents if they are treated with anagrelide for a prolonged period of time. Therefore, the SmPC 
recommends regular monitoring for early signs of progression to AML and myelofibrosis in section 4.4 
of the SmPC. Children should be monitored regularly for disease progression according to standard 
clinical practices, such as physical examination, assessment of relevant disease markers, and bone 
marrow biopsy. Any abnormalities should be evaluated promptly and appropriate measures taken, 
which may also include dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation. 
The incidence of headache was slightly lower for the pooled studies (6.8% overall) than seen across 
the programme (approximately 14%). This is likely due to the relatively short observation period 
encompassed by this analysis. 
The results in study SPD422-405a indicated that similar safety profiles were observed between children 
and adolescents compared to adults and elderly subjects. However, the results are based on an 
arbitrary cut off in ages in SPD422-202 study (≤15 years versus ≥16 years) and the pooled analysis is 
based on the the first 30 days of treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to determine conclusively if 
there are any particular safety concern associated with the administration of anagrelide to children. 
The SmPC has been updated to reflect the uncertainty in the safety data with the following paragraph 
in section 4.8: 
Paediatric population 
48 patients aged 6-17 years (19 children and 29 adolescents) have received anagrelide for up to 6.5 
years either in clinical studies or as part of a disease registry (see section 5.1). 
The majority of adverse events observed were among those listed in the SmPC. However, safety data 
are limited and do not allow a meaningful comparison between adult and paediatric patients to be 
made (see section 4.4). 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The estimation of the anagrelide safety in paediatric population is limited by the short duration of 
treatment, the restricted number of paediatric patients enrolled in the studies and that the safety of 
anagrelide compared to other cytoreductive therapies may be confounded by prior anagrelide exposure. 
Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that it is not possible to conclude that the safety of anagrelide 
treatment in children is similar as in adults.  
2.4.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The product was approved in 2004, before the implementation of the pharmacovigilance legislation. 
Thus, the product does not have a risk management plan.

2.6.  Update of the Product information 
The indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC was not agreed by the CHMP. However, other changes to the 
SmPC have been revised and sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 and section 2 and 3 of PL were 
amended with information on the study results of anagelide in children. Section 4.8 of the SmPC and 
section 4 of the PL has been reformatted and adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness. 
The SmPC was updated with information on the paediatric clinical data from the studies submitted. The 
main relevant changes to the information in relation to the paediatric population are as follows: 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
[…] 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of anagrelide in children has not been established. The experience in children 
and adolescents is very limited; anagrelide should be used in this patient group with caution. In the 
absence of specific paediatric guidelines, WHO diagnostic criteria for adult diagnosis of ET are 
considered to be of relevance to the paediatric population. Diagnostic guidelines for essential 
thrombocythemia should be followed carefully and diagnosis reassessed periodically in cases of 
uncertainty, with effort made to distinguish from hereditary or secondary thrombocytosis, which may 
include genetic analysis and bone marrow biopsy. 
Typically cytoreductive therapy is considered in high risk paediatric patients.  
Anagrelide treatment should only be initiated when the patient shows signs of disease progression or 
suffers from thrombosis. If treatment is initiated, the benefits and risks of treatment with anagrelide 
must be monitored regularly and the need for ongoing treatment evaluated periodically.  
Platelet targets are assigned on an individual patient basis by the treating physician.  
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in paediatric patients who do not have a satisfactory 
treatment response after approximately 3 months.  
Currently available data are described in sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of Administration 
For oral use. The capsules must be swallowed whole. Do not crush or dilute the contents in a liquid. 
[…] 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC: 
[…] 
Paediatric population 
In an open-label clinical study in 8 children and 10 adolescents (including patients who were anagrelide 
treatment  naïve  or  who  had  been  receiving  anagrelide  for  up  to  5  years  pre-study),  platelet  counts 
were decreased to controlled levels after 12 weeks of treatment. The average daily dose tended to be 
higher in adolescents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/697040/2014 
Page 39/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a paediatric registry study, median platelet counts were reduced from diagnosis and maintained for 
up to 18 months in 14 paediatric ET patients (4 children, 10 adolescents) with anagrelide treatment. In 
earlier,  open-label  studies,  median  platelet  count  reductions  were  observed  in  7  children  and  9 
adolescents treated for between 3 months and 6.5 years.  
The  average  total  daily  dose  of  anagrelide  across  all  studies  in  paediatric  ET  patients  was  highly 
variable,  but  overall  the  data  suggest  that  adolescents  could  follow  similar  starting  and  maintenance 
doses to adults and that a lower starting dose of 0.5 mg/day would be more appropriate for children 
over 6 years (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.2). In all paediatric patients, careful titration to a patient-
specific  daily  dose  is  needed.  .  An  open  label  clinical  study  with  a  3  month  treatment  period  did  not 
raise any safety concerns for anagrelide in 17 children/adolescent patients with ET (age range 7 - 14 
years)  compared  to  18  adult  patients.  Earlier  during  clinical  development  a  limited  number  (12)  of 
children (age range 5 - 17 years) with essential thrombocythaemia were treated with anagrelide. 
[…] 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Anagrelide has been shown to reduce and maintain platelet counts close to or within the physiological 
range in paediatric patients with ET.  In study SPD422-404 study, median platelet counts had 
substantially decreased between diagnosis and baseline (778x109/L in the no treatment/A-A alone 
cohort, 477x109/L in the cytoreductive therapy cohort, and 476x109/L in the anagrelide cohort). 
Thereafter, platelet counts were maintained for both the cytoreductive therapy and anagrelide cohorts, 
whereas platelet counts in the no treatment/A-A alone cohort generally remained at elevated levels of 
around 1000x109/L. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are several uncertainties in relation to efficacy. There is uncertainty in the knowledge on the 
absolute or relative reduction of platelet count that is expected and whether there is a set interval of 
time that the platelet count should have reduced.  For adult patients, anagrelide treatment is titrated 
to a patient-specific dosing regimen in order to optimise platelet reduction while limiting adverse 
events. However, no such recommendation that can be made for paediatric patients based on the adult 
data since there is insufficient evidence to extrapolate the data to paediatric patients. The PK/PD data 
from Studies SPD422-202 and SPD422-203 are not robust enough determine a starting dose for 
paediatric patients because of the deficiencies in the methodology employed. 
The minimal threshold or range for platelets count in paediatric population has not been defined. Using 
the same platelet level target for paediatric as for adult patients has not been robustly justified. In 
addition, there is no optimal regimen of treatment proposed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/697040/2014 
Page 40/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pivotal efficacy study, SPD422-404, is limited to a retrospective non interventional registry with 
only 14 paediatric patients treated, although the demographic data, medical and ET history and clinical 
laboratory data were captured retrospectively in the case report form. Many patients had previously 
received treatment with anagrelide, which could confound the treatment effect of anagrelide and the 
interpretation of the results.  
The SPD422-405b pooled analysis was not designed to measure efficacy and therefore is only 
informative in terms of exposure and confirmation of pharmacodynamic activity in children and 
adolescents. 
There is also uncertainty on the compliance of treatment for paediatric patients who cannot swallow 
capsules. There is concern that the pharmaceutical form is not appropriate for young children as it 
cannot be crushed or diluted in a liquid.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The paediatric safety study population was representative of the expected ET population where the 
adult ET population are predominantly women.  Across all studies, there was a slightly greater 
proportion of females among adolescents (60% in SPD422-405a, 67% in SPD422-405b and 70% in 
SPD422-404) and in the subgroup of children, proportion of females was 50%, 43% and 60% 
respectively. 
A minority of patients (16 / 59) experienced any adverse event related or not to ET treatment in the 
pivotal SPD-422-404. The majority of AEs occurred in the no treatment/A-A alone cohort. 
Treatment switching was relatively infrequent during SPD422-404 study. Of the subjects who were 
currently receiving cytoreductive therapy, only 1 subject switched from Xagrid to hydroxycarbamide. 
There were no unexpected safety concerns raised in the safety population and most ADRs were 
consistent with the safety adult population described in the SmPC. The ADRs such as headache, 
tachycardia, palpitations, hypotension and diarrhoea have already been described in the SmPC and 
they were found to be mild to moderate in severity in the paediatric population. Some AEs, which were 
not cited in the adult population, were reported in paediatric population in system organ class such as 
injury poisoning, infections and infestations or reproductive system and breast disorders.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is uncertainty in the knowledge of the estimation of anagrelide safety in paediatric population 
since the number of paediatric patients available in the studies was low, the duration of treatment was 
short and there was prior anagrelide exposure in patients that entered the study. In addition, there 
was no comparative safety with other cytoreductive agents and reporting of ADRs was part of routine 
clinical practice and at the discretion of the treating physician with no scheduled safety assessments. 
The transformation of ET to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was not investigated. PSUR 
11 (covering the period 14-Sep-2012 to 13-Sep-2013) and the 9th Annual Reassessment Report 
(submitted on 2-Dec-2013) concluded that the clinical trial experience to date does not suggest that 
transformation to these disorders is enhanced by treatment with anagrelide, and rates at which these 
conditions are being reported as adverse events has remained stable. Nonetheless, the risk is 
appropriately managed with warnings in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Based on the results of the pivotal trial SPD422-404, the pooled study SPD422-405 and the supportive 
paediatric data submitted, the benefits of anagrelide in the paediatric population have not been 
robustly demonstrated. There are remaining uncertainties concerning the safety of anagrelide in the 
paediatric population which were not sufficiently addressed. Therefore, the CHMP was of the opinion 
that there was not enough robust clinical data in the studies submitted to support the indication and 
that the benefit-risk balance for the indication: “children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with ET who 
are intolerant to their current therapy or whose elevated platelet counts are not reduced to an 
acceptable level by their current therapy ” was negative. However, it was agreed that the information 
on the paediatric clinical results of the studies could be included in the SmPC.

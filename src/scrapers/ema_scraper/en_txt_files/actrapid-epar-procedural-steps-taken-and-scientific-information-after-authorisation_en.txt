Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
To update the Human Insulin RMP to version 3.1 in 
order to reclassify the risk of 'Medication errors' 
(including human error-related medication errors) 
from an important potential risk to an important 
identified risk following a Pharmacovigilance Risk 
Assessment Committee (PRAC) request 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001753/201710) and in 
accordance with the Good practice guide on risk 
minimisation and prevention of medication errors, 
issued by the PRAC in 2015.   
Furthermore, in accordance with the updated GVP 
Module V guidance on RMPs, the Work sharing 
Applicant (WSA) proposed to remove this risk as it is 
fully characterised and managed through routine 
pharmacovigilance and no additional 
pharmacovigilance activities or additional risk 
minimisation measures are planned or being 
currently undertaken. 
Information regarding the avoidance of accidental 
mix-ups/medication errors is included in the PIL for 
the concerned products. In consequence, section 4.4

of the SmPC was updated in order to add a warning 
on accidental mix-ups/medication.  
Additionally, the WSA took the opportunity include 
minor updates to Annex IIIA to bring the PI in line 
with the latest QRD template version.

done to make the information more legible for both 
healthcare professionals and patients, and specifically to 
highlight that rotating the injection site does not 
necessarily prevent development of lipodystrophy but may 
help to reduce the risk for such development. 
In addition, the MAH has provided calculations showing that

be considered “sodium-free”. 
Furthermore, changes to all annexes have been introduced 
in order to comply with latest version of the QRD template 
(v. 8.0, rev. 1). The variation also includes changes to 
sections 4.6 and 4.8 of the SmPC which are based on the 
recommendations in the SmPC Guideline. The SmPC has 
also been modified in order to align it with the updates 
already implemented for other insulin products from the

new information about "concomitant illness" to 
harmonise with the product information of other 
insulins; and additionally hypoglycaemia to be

been updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
latest QRD template version 8.0 rev. 1 and with the 
SmPC Guideline. 
Minor changes to the labelling have been made in 
relation to the implementation of the new design on 
Novo Nordisk A/S cartons and labels.  
Lastly, the information relating to counterfeit needles 
has been deleted and the sentence in section 4.5 of

The PhVWP was requested to consider whether the 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Further to a CHMP request based on the 
recommendations from PhVWP, the Product 
Information (Summary of Product Characteristics 
section 4.4 and Package Leaflet section 2) is updated 
by adding a warning on an increased incidence of 
heart failure when pioglitazone is used in 
combination with insulin, especially in patients with 
predisposing factors.  
In addition to the above the MAH took the 
opportunity to update annex IIB "Other conditions" 
with the latest wording as per October 2010 CHMP 
announcment regarding the Pharmacovigilance 
system.  
This application was submitted for a group of 
variations consisting of variations following a

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
increased risk of fluid retention and exacerbation of heart 
failure with the concomitant use of pioglitazone and insulin 
should apply to all centrally authorised insulin products. 
After the review of the available evidence, during its 
October 2010 meeting the PhVWP has concluded this 
review with a recommendation to the CHMP on the need to 
harmonise the SmPC and PL for all insulin products by 
including appropriate warning. The CHMP endorsed this 
recommendation, and in this context the Committee agreed 
that all centrally authorised insulin containing products 
should include warning on increased cardiac failure when 
pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially 
in patients with predisposing factors in the in the section 
4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL. 
Annex IIB "Other conditions" was also updated with the 
latest wording as per October 2010 CHMP announcment

undesirable effects using the MedDRA terminology, and to 
list them according to frequencies. 
The introduction to section 4.8 of the SPCs has also been 
updated to state that hypoglycaemia is the most frequent 
undesirable effect, but no exact frequency is included, as 
the frequency of hypoglycaemia is highly variable among 
various patient populations and dose regimens.  
This update of section 4.8 also includes the removal of 
hyperglycaemia. All information on hyperglycaemia 
(including symptoms) has been located in section 4.4, 
including the warning of the risk of fatal outcome of 
untreated hyperglycaemic events.  
The terms `diabetic retinopathy' and `painful neuropathy' 
have been added to section 4.8. The adverse event 
"Fainting/loss of consciousness" is also added to the list in 
section 4.8. 
These changes have been reflected in the section 5 of the 
Package Leaflet. 
In addition changes have been made to the Product 
Information to reflect the CHMP Note for Guidance on 
Declaration of Storage Conditions, linguistic amendments in 
accordance to the latest QRD template (version 6, 1/2004)

Summary of Risk Management Plan for Deferasirox Mylan film-coated tablets (Deferasirox) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Deferasirox Mylan film-coated tablets. 
The RMP details important risks of deferasirox, how these risks can be minimised, and how more 
information will be obtained about deferasirox's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Deferasirox  Mylan  film-coated  tablet
  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its 
package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how it should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Deferasirox Mylan film-coated tablets should be read in the context 
of  all  the  information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Deferasirox 
Mylan film-
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What it is Used For 
Deferasirox is indicated for:  
Deferasirox Mylan film-coated tablets is authorised for the treatment of chronic iron overload due 
d blood cells) in patients with beta 
thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older.  
Deferasirox Mylan film-coated tablets is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload 
due to blood transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. 
Deferasirox Mylan film-coated tablets is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload 
requiring chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients 
with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. 
It contains deferasirox as the active substance and it is given by oral route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Deferasirox Mylan film-
be  found  in  Deferasirox  Mylan  film-coated  tablets  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/deferasirox-mylan.  
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks 
Important risks of Deferasirox Mylan film-coated tablets, together with measures to minimise such 
risks  and  the  proposed  studies  for  learning  more  about  Deferasirox  Mylan  film-
risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific  Information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
The authorised pack size 
the medicine is used correctly; 
the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
 the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  events  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Deferasirox Mylan film-coated tablets is 
In the case of Deferasirox Mylan  film-coated  tablets, these  routine  measures are  supplemented 
with additional risk minimisation measures, mentioned under relevant risks below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important  risks  of  Deferasirox  Mylan  film-coated  tablets  are  risks  that  need  special  risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can 
be safely taken by patients. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Deferasirox Mylan 
film-coated  tablets.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an  association  with  the  use  of  this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be  collected  (e.g.  on  the  long-term  use  of  the 
medicine/use in special patient populations, etc.).

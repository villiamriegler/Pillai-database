Scientific discussion 
Introduction 
Conbriza contains the active substance bazedoxifene and was authorised in the EU on 17 April 2009. 
Bazedoxifene belongs to a class of compounds known as selective estrogen receptor modulators 
(SERMs). Bazedoxifene acts as both an oestrogen-receptor agonist and/or antagonist, depending upon 
the cell and tissue type and target genes. Bazedoxifene decreases bone resorption and reduces 
biochemical markers of bone turnover to the premenopausal range. These effects on bone remodeling 
lead to an increase in bone mineral density (BMD), which in turn contributes to a reduction in the risk 
of fractures. Bazedoxifene functions primarily as an oestrogen-receptor antagonist in uterine and 
breast tissues. 
Conbriza is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of 
fracture. A significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated; efficacy 
on hip fractures has not been established. 
When determining the choice of Conbriza or other therapies, including oestrogens, for an individual 
postmenopausal woman, consideration should be given to menopausal symptoms, effects on uterine 
and breast tissues, and cardiovascular risks and benefits. 
This type II variation concerns an update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC to add safety and 
efficacy information after long-term treatment for up to 5-years from an extension of the pivotal Study 
301-WW, submitted as part of the initial marketing authorisation application. The Package Leaflet has 
been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update Annex II with the 
standard DDPS wording, to update the annexes in line with the current QRD template, version 7.3.1 
and the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics, revision 2, and to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
Clinical aspects 
Extension I (60 months) of pivotal study 301-WW  
Osteoporosis treatment trial 301-WW is an ongoing, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, active 
controlled, phase 3 study, designed as a 3-year core study with two 2-year double-blind, placebo-
controlled extensions; the core study was pivotal for the granting of the marketing authorisation for 
Conbriza. Originally the trial examined 4 groups, bazedoxifene 20 mg, bazedoxifene 40 mg, raloxifene 
60 mg, and placebo. All participants were to be supplemented with 1000 mg to 1200 mg of calcium 
carbonate and 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D according to local standards. The study continues to be 
double-blind and placebo-controlled. During Extension I, month 36 through month 60, subjects from 
the raloxifene group were withdrawn after the last subject had completed the core study, and the 
database for the 36-month analysis was finalised. In addition, all subjects in the bazedoxifene 40 mg 
group were given the option to either switch to bazedoxifene 20 mg or to withdraw from the study at 
their first visit after all subjects had completed 4 years of treatment (bazedoxifene 40/20 mg).  
Extension I did not include raloxifene, but to maintain the blind for the core study, subjects in the 
raloxifene 60 mg group were to participate in Extension I until the last subject had completed the core 
study and the database for the 3-year core study analysis had been finalized. After it had been 
determined that the marketed dose of bazedoxifene was to be 20 mg, the dose in the bazedoxifene 
40 mg group was reduced to 20 mg daily. Before dose reduction, all subjects remaining in the study, 
regardless of treatment, were informed in a blinded manner of the impending dose change and

required to sign a new ICF; patients unwilling to sign the new ICF were withdrawn from the study. The 
study is continuing for an additional 2 years in study Extension II from the end of year 5 until the end 
of year 7. The 3-year core study was conducted at 206 investigative sites in Canada, United States, 
and countries in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and South Africa.  
Analyses of data after 60 months of treatment (Extension I) have been submitted for this variation.  
Methods 
The primary objectives of Extension I were to evaluate the efficacy of bazedoxifene 20 mg and 
bazedoxifene 40/20 mg in comparison with placebo in reducing the incidence of new vertebral 
fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis after 5-years of therapy and to compare the 
safety profile of bazedoxifene with placebo over 5 years of treatment.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative incidence of new radiographically confirmed 
vertebral fractures (thoracic and lumbar spine, T4-L4) for bazedoxifene and placebo from baseline to 
60 months of therapy, expressed as Kaplan-Meier rates. All radiographs were evaluated centrally.  
Secondary objectives were to compare data on the incidence of breast cancer, clinical vertebral 
fractures, worsening vertebral fractures, non-vertebral fractures (NVF), height changes, BMD of the 
lumbar spine and hip, effects on the endometrium (endometrial sub-study only), serum bone markers 
(long-term bone markers sub-study only), and bone histomorphometry (histomorphometry sub-study 
II only). 
Safety was monitored by means of physical examinations, gynaecologic examinations, mammography, 
cervical cytology smears, clinical laboratory determinations, vertebral radiographic assessments, and 
recording of AEs. For subjects enrolled in the endometrial safety substudy, and for subjects in the 
safety population when clinically indicated, endometrial thickness, ovarian volume, and presence and 
size of ovarian cysts were determined by transvaginal ultrasonography (TVU), and endometrial 
histology was used for the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia, malignancy, and polyps. NVFs, breast 
cancer, cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were assessed by 
independent blinded adjudication boards. 
The analysis method for the primary efficacy endpoint was similar to the core study, utilizing Kaplan-
Meier estimates for cumulative rate estimation, stratified log-rank test for between groups 
comparisons, and Cox proportional hazard regression for hazard ratio estimation. Subgroup analysis 
was performed for subjects with and without vertebral fractures present at baseline. Kaplan-Meier 
estimates of NVF cumulative incidence and between-group comparisons using the log-rank test were 
produced for 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of treatment. The incidence of breast cancer over 5 
years between the combined bazedoxifene treatment groups and the placebo group was compared by 
means of logistic regression. Relative risk and excess risk compared with the placebo group was 
provided together with 95% CIs. The percent change from baseline of BMD was analyzed at months 6, 
12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 by analysis of covariance on the percent change from baseline. Prevalent 
vertebral status fracture and geographical region were included as factors in the model and baseline 
BMD as a covariate. The ranked percent change of s-CTx and serum osteocalcin from baseline to 3, 6, 
12, 36, and 60 months was analyzed using an analysis of covariance with terms for treatment, and 
baseline as covariate. 
Results 
A total of 7492 subjects (including subjects in the raloxifene-treated arm) were included in the analysis 
of efficacy and safety of the core study; 3140 withdrew from the study in months 0 to 60 (1053

Analysis of the incidence of vertebral fractures was carried out using the ITT population, which included 
all randomized subjects who had taken at least 1 dose of test article, and for whom a valid vertebral 
fracture radiographic assessment was done at baseline and at least once while on therapy. Details are 
given in Table 3.

Fracture Data 
ITT = intent-to-treat. 
n represents the number of subjects in each therapy group included or excluded, and number excluded for each criteria. A subject may have 
been excluded for more than 1 reason. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics of subjects participating in Extension I were comparable to 
that of the core study and there were no significant differences between groups in Extension I 
regarding baseline characteristics. Baseline BMD T-scores for the lumbar spine in the ITT population of 
study 301-WW were approximately -2.4 for each group (range -2.38 to -2.40). In the ITT population 
approximately 56% per group (range 55.87% to 56.35%) had a prevalent vertebral fracture, the 
majority of which had 1 mild fracture.  
Compliance with the assigned regimen was measured as the percentage of scheduled test article 
capsules and calcium supplement tablets consumed. Details are given in the following table. 
Table 4: Number (%) of Subjects with Treatment Compliance ≥ 80%, Months 0 to 
60 
Compliance % is calculated as number of capsules taken divided by the scheduled number of capsules during duration of therapy. 
Primary Endpoint 
Compared to placebo treatment with bazedoxifene resulted in a lower cumulative rate of vertebral 
fractures and a corresponding reduction in risk of vertebral fracture regardless of baseline vertebral 
fracture status. The effect was apparent for all active treatment groups at 24 months, reaching 
statistical significance by 36 months. For the month 0 to 36 interval, the Kaplan-Meier rate estimates 
of cumulative fracture incidence for the bazedoxifene 20 and 40 mg and the raloxifene 60 mg groups 
were 2.34%, 2.51%, and 2.34%, respectively; they were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that seen 
in the placebo group (4.07%). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative incidence of radiographically 
confirmed new vertebral fractures for months 0 to 36, 0 to 48, and 0 to 60 in the ITT population are 
presented in Table 5 and Figure 2. The treatment effect was sustained through 60 months of 
treatment. From month 0 to 60, vertebral fracture incidence rates were 6.82%, 4.49%, and 3.92% for 
placebo, bazedoxifene 20 mg, and bazedoxifene 40/20 mg, respectively.

Figure  2:  Kaplan-Meier  Estimates  of  Incident  Vertebral  Fractures,  Intent-to-Treat 
Population, Months 0 to 60 (Study 301-WW) 
At 36 months, estimates of the relative risk reduction (RRR) of vertebral fracture compared with 
placebo were 42% for bazedoxifene 20 mg, 37% for bazedoxifene 40 mg, and 42% for raloxifene 
60 mg; at 60 months, the RRR were 35% for bazedoxifene 20 mg and 40% for bazedoxifene 
40/20 mg; the difference between the 2 bazedoxifene groups was not statistically significant 
(p = 0.69). The treatment effect was also observed at 48 months. Analysis by strata of subjects with 
and without prevalent vertebral fracture did not show differences in the effect between strata. For 
subjects with no radiographically confirmed vertebral fracture at baseline, the RRR was 35%. For 
subjects with at least 1 prevalent vertebral fracture at baseline, the RRR was 45% for the bazedoxifene 
20 mg and 38% for the bazedoxifene 40 mg group. Similar results were seen after 60 months of 
treatment (see Table 6). Analysis of the interaction of treatment group and study phase (core study 
vs. Extension I) did not show a significant interaction (p > 0.6), indicating that the treatment effect 
was maintained during Extension I.

Secondary Endpoints 
The principal investigator evaluated each NVF and classified it as osteoporotic or traumatic. Traumatic 
or pathologic fractures and fractures of body locations face, skull, toes, fingers, and elbow were 
excluded from the NVF analysis. The incidence of NVF, including hip and wrist fractures, was relatively 
low and there were no significant differences between groups. Kaplan-Meier estimates of non-
adjudicated osteoporosis-related NVF for months 0 to 36, 0 to 48, and 0 to 60 are presented in Table 
7. These data do not indicate significant differences between treatment groups in NVF rates over 36, 
48, and 60 months. There was no evidence of treatment effect on the incidence of NV, hip, or wrist 
fractures with bazedoxifene treatment relative to placebo through 36 or 60 months of treatment.

Pathologic NVFs are excluded. Summary based on principal investigator's data. 
The applicant has also performed a post-hoc analysis of NVF for a high fracture risk subgroup defined 
as subjects with a femoral neck T-score of ≤ -3, or the presence of at least 1 moderate vertebral 
fracture, or multiple vertebral fractures at baseline based on core study data. Comparisons between 
groups based on HR estimates and by stratified log-rank test are presented in Table 8. Statistically 
significant reductions were observed in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group at months 36 and 48, with a 
similar trend noted at 60 months. These analyses suggest that bazedoxifene might be beneficial in a 
subgroup of subjects at high risk for NVF when the risk for fractures is primarily due to a compromised 
skeleton (low BMD or prevalent fractures). As in the 36-month core study the incidence of NVF in this 
post-hoc subgroup was significantly lower in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group than in the placebo group

at 48 months, and showed a similar, but not statistically significant, trend at 60 months; there was no 
significant reduction in the bazedoxifene 40/20 mg treatment group.

Pathologic non-vertebral fractures are excluded. Summary based on principal investigator's data. 
The model is: time-to-fracture=treatment +baseline vertebral status fracture + femoral neck T-score. p-Value is based on the log-rank test. 
Data were also analysed using the FRAX tool to estimate the 10-year fracture probability in subjects 
treated with bazedoxifene and the treatment effect as a function of fracture risk. Interaction between 
treatment of combined bazedoxifene 20 and 40 mg versus placebo and the 10-year probability of 
osteoporotic fracture was examined with and without inclusion of baseline BMD. The relationship 
between treatment effect over 36 months and baseline fracture risk based on FRAX was estimated. 
The population enrolled in study 301-WW had a mean 10 year fracture probability of 10.5%. HRs 
decreased with increasing fracture probability. A similar effect was observed for NVF. Using 10-year 
fracture probability as a baseline risk, a significant reduction in all clinical and all NVF was observed 
with bazedoxifene. In addition, a significant reduction in morphometric vertebral fractures was 
observed using the WHO fracture assessment tool, supporting the bazedoxifene treatment effect. The 
fracture benefit increased with increasing fracture probabilities. The treatment effect was evident at or 
above a fracture probability of 16%, 21%, and 6.9% for all clinical, NVF, and morphometric vertebral 
fractures, respectively.  
BMD was assessed at baseline and at months 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 at anatomic sites lumbar 
spine, total hip, femoral neck, and femoral trochanter. Populations of interest for BMD 5-year analyses 
were anatomic site-specific MITT populations including subjects who took at least 1 dose of test article, 
and who had a BMD evaluation at the site of interest at baseline and at least once during Extension I. 
Statistically significant (p < 0.001) increases from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine were seen in 
both bazedoxifene treatment groups beginning at month 6; the mean percent change from baseline 
reached maximum between months 12 and 18 and was sustained through month 60. Smaller, 
statistically significant (p < 0.001) increases from baseline in BMD were also noted for the placebo 
group. After reaching a maximum at month 12, the BMD in the placebo group showed further small 
increases at months 36, 48, and 60. The increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD in both 
bazedoxifene treatment groups were statistically significantly greater than the increases in the placebo 
group at all time points. The mean percentage changes from baseline in BMD of the total hip were 
significantly different from that in the placebo group. In the bazedoxifene groups, the BMD of the total 
hip at 60 months compared to baseline was maintained, while a significant bone loss was observed in 
the placebo groups. However, all groups showed a decline in total hip BMD from about 12 month 
onward. In summary over 60 months, the changes from baseline in BMD in both bazedoxifene groups 
were statistically significantly greater than in the placebo group for all time points at all 4 skeletal 
sites.

No effect on loss of height was seen with bazedoxifene treatment. This was most likely the result of a 
relatively low-risk population affected by osteoporosis who experienced a relatively small number of 
new vertebral fractures, especially severe vertebral fractures, making detection of changes in height

at months 3, 6, and 12 for all subjects, and at months 36 and 60 for a subset. In the bazedoxifene 
groups, serum osteocalcin level decreased from baseline at all time points evaluated. In study 
301-WW, percentage decreases from baseline were significantly (p ≤ 0.001) greater for all 
bazedoxifene groups compared to placebo at each time point evaluated. Serum CTx levels decreased 
from baseline in the bazedoxifene groups at all time points evaluated. Decreases were significantly 
(p  0.05) greater for all bazedoxifene groups compared to placebo at all time points evaluated. These

effects were sustained through month 60. There was little difference between the 2 bazedoxifene 
groups in the magnitude of the changes. 
Regarding the lipid profile, overall, bazedoxifene 20 or 40 mg resulted in an increased HDL-C, 
decreased LDL-C and TC, and neutral effects on TG levels compared with placebo; these effects were 
maintained through 60 months of treatment. The clinical relevance of the observed changes in lipid 
profile remains to be determined.  
After 36 months of exposure to bazedoxifene the number of subjects diagnosed with breast cancer was 
numerically, but not statistically significant, lower in the bazedoxifene groups compared to placebo. 
However, after 60 months of treatment, the overall incidence of breast cancer was not different 
between groups; the 28 cases included in the analysis were similarly distributed among treatment 
groups, 9 in each of the 2 bazedoxifene groups and 10 in the placebo group.  
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In study 301 overall 7609 subjects have been enrolled; the safety population of the 3 year core study 
includes 7492 women, of whom 3758 have been treated with bazedoxifene. The 24-month Extension I 
includes 3146 subjects, of whom 2088 have been treated with bazedoxifene.   
Adverse events 
A total of 5359 (95.0%) subjects reported at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) and in 
study Extension I 3075 (97.7%) subjects reported at least 1 TEAE. Abdominal pain, accidental injury, 
arthralgia, back pain, flu syndrome, headache, hypertension, infection, and pain were reported since 
the start of the study by ≥ 20% of subjects in at least 1 of the bazedoxifene or placebo groups. The 
incidences of vasodilatation, leg cramps, and depression were significantly different among 
bazedoxifene and placebo groups with the lowest rates occurring in the placebo group. The incidences 
of accidental injury, hypercholesterolaemia, anxiety, pharyngitis, and vaginitis were significantly 
different among these groups with the highest rates occurring in the placebo group.  
In general, the common and non-serious adverse events reported during the 60 months of Extension 1 
are consistent with the results of the 36-month core study and do not raise new safety concerns for 
the use of bazedoxifene. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths  
A total of 81 subjects died on therapy or had their deaths reported to the sponsor after conclusion of 
study participation, 24 (1.3%) in the bazedoxifene 20 mg, 18 (1.0%) in the bazedoxifene 40/20 mg, 
13 (0.7%) in the placebo, and 26 (1.4 %) in the raloxifene 60 mg group. Overall, there were fewer 
deaths with placebo relative to bazedoxifene and raloxifene groups. The number of deaths due to CV 
aetiologies was similar between bazedoxifene and placebo. Compared to placebo, there were more 
deaths due to cancer in the bazedoxifene 20 mg, but not the bazedoxifene 40/20 mg group. The 
cancer deaths were not noted in any specific organ system and were not consistent with known 
estrogen dependent cancers. In addition, there were more deaths in the “other” category, which 
included a variety of conditions, in the bazedoxifene treatment groups compared to placebo. Table 9 
summarises the deaths reported to the sponsor by category.

Serious Adverse Events 
Regarding SAEs, the results observed during Extension I were similar to those observed in the core 
study. A total of 1345 (23.8%) subjects reported at least 1 SAE and for 99 (1.8%), these events were 
considered by the investigator to be at least possibly drug related. Overall, the number of subjects with 
at least 1 SAE was similar among bazedoxifene and placebo groups (p = 0.508). No significant 
differences were observed for the SAEs of special interest cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarct 
and myocardial ischemia, endometrial neoplasia (endometrial polyps), and breast carcinoma. There 
was a significant difference among the 3 groups for DVT, with more cases reported for the 
bazedoxifene groups compared to placebo (p=0.042).

Particular attention was paid to the AEs VTEs, selected cardiovascular events including CVEs, 
vasodilatation, reproductive disorders, including breast disorders, and leg cramps. All AEs were defined 
as events reported during therapy and after therapy (after the last dose of test article). 
VTE events were defined in the bazedoxifene clinical trials as any acute DVT, any acute PE, or any RVT. 
These events were adjudicated by experts in order to provide accurate and unbiased assessment of 
these events. Adjudicated data were similar to the unadjudicated clinical database results. Table 12 
summarises all AEs and TEAEs for VTEs by group for the safety population in the 5-year database, 
based on verbatim descriptions. Overall, a small number of VTE events were observed, with a higher 
but not statistically significant (p = 0.359) incidence with bazedoxifene compared to placebo. The 
higher incidence was a result of an increased incidence of DVT; the significant increase in DVT was 
observed in the bazedoxifene groups compared with placebo. Superficial thrombophlebitis was also 
reported with a higher incidence in the bazedoxifene groups compared with placebo. The incidence of 
PE and RVT was comparable among all 3 groups. Based on the adjudicated data, the RR for the 
bazedoxifene 20 mg group relative to placebo was 1.63 at 36 months and remained similar after 60 
months (RR = 1.5). The RR was similar between the 2 dose groups.

Regarding selected CVE after 60 months of treatment no increased incidence was observed for 
coronary occlusion, myocardial infarction, or myocardial ischemia in either of the bazedoxifene groups 
compared to placebo. The incidence of subjects with any ischaemic and hemorrhagic CV AE was similar 
and not significantly different among groups. No difference was observed in the overall incidence of CV 
AEs between active treatment groups and placebo. CVEs were also adjudicated by an independent 
Adjudication Board including identification of strokes and TIAs. Table 13 summarizes the results of the 
adjudication. Adjudicated data were similar to the unadjudicated clinical database results. Overall, 
small numbers of CVEs were observed and the incidence of all CVEs was similar and not statistically 
different among groups. The adjudicated data for total stroke or ischaemic stroke showed that there 
were no clinically or statistically significant differences. The adjudicated data for TIA showed 
numerically more cases of TIA in the bazedoxifene 40/20 mg group compared with the other groups. 
All subjects in this 40/20 mg treatment group had TIA prior to the switch to bazedoxifene 20 mg. The 
number of TIAs in the bazedoxifene 20 mg group was similar to placebo. The incidence of hemorrhagic 
strokes was higher in the placebo group. There were 7 fatal strokes through 60 months, 2 in the

The incidence rates for vasodilatation and leg cramps were significantly higher in the bazedoxifene 
groups compared with placebo, but were similar between the bazedoxifene groups. 
Regarding the reproductive system bazedoxifene exhibited a neutral endometrial profile. TVU 
examinations of uterus and ovaries revealed no clinically relevant changes in endometrial thickness, 
ovarian volume, or ovarian cysts with bazedoxifene treatment. No increased incidence of endometrial 
neoplasm (polyps) or hyperplasia was observed in the bazedoxifene groups compared with placebo. 
There were fewer cases of endometrial carcinoma, at both 3 and 5 years, in the bazedoxifene groups 
compared with placebo, 0 subjects in the bazedoxifene 20 mg, 3 in the bazedoxifene 40/20 mg, 2 in 
the raloxifene 60 mg, and 6 in the placebo group for up to 60 months. Overall, the incidence of AEs 
related to the reproductive system was similar to that with placebo. Through 60 months, a total of 10 
subjects were reported to have AEs coded to the preferred term ovarian carcinoma, 5 in the 
bazedoxifene 20 mg, 1 in the bazedoxifene 40/20 mg, 4 in the raloxifene 60 mg, and no subjects in 
the placebo group. Upon examination of the histopathological reports, 2 of the 5 cases in bazedoxifene 
20 mg group were not confirmed as ovarian carcinoma. There was 1 case reported in the higher dose 
bazedoxifene 40 mg treatment group, suggesting that a causal relationship is unlikely. 
The integrated safety database revealed that 510 subjects (5.8%) reported depression as an adverse 
event (AE). There was no statistically significant difference among treatment groups in the number of 
subjects reporting depression as an AE (bazedoxifene 20 mg n = 128 [5.8%], bazedoxifene 40 mg 
n = 142 [6.5%], raloxifene n = 128 [5.9%], and placebo n = 112 [5.1%], p = 0.278). Additionally, 
there were no clinically meaningful differences found between treatment groups. In each of the 
individual studies, there was no statistically significant difference among treatment groups in the 
number of subjects reporting depression as an AE.  
There was a statistically significant difference among the 3 treatment groups (bazedoxifene 20 mg, 
bazedoxifene 40/20 mg, and placebo) participating in the extension to study 301 with regard to the 
number of subjects reporting depression as either a TEAE or an AE in the 5-year data from study 301. 
Assessment report  
EMA/221698/2011  
Page 13/16
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, pairwise comparisons between treatment groups demonstrated that the only statistically 
significant differences for the number of subjects reporting depression as an AE or as a TEAE were 
between the bazedoxifene 40/20 mg and placebo groups (p = 0.017; p = 0.016). There was no 
significant difference between the bazedoxifene 20 mg dose group (the ‘approved’ dose) and the 
placebo group (p = 0.470). Importantly, no clinically meaningful differences were found between either 
dose of bazedoxifene and placebo. In addition, the current EU SPC for raloxifene does not identify 
depression as an ADR; hence, depression does not appear to be a known class effect for SERMs. 
With respect to these data there is currently no indication of a significant increase of depression for 
bazedoxifene 20 mg, which is the approved dose. However, there seems to be a dose dependency; a 
significant difference to placebo was seen in the 40/20 mg bazedoxifene group.  
The MAH will include depression as a potential risk in the RMP and has committed to present a 
cumulative review of spontaneous reports and interim data from the ongoing study extension phase II 
as a follow-up measure. Currently no changes to the Product Information are considered necessary. 
Laboratory findings 
The clinical laboratory analyses did not disclose any clinically meaningful difference between groups 
after 60 months of treatment. The mean changes from baseline of ALT and AST levels were similar 
among groups and no significant differences were observed in potentially clinically important laboratory 
test results for ALT and AST levels at any evaluation time point. However, there were significantly 
fewer subjects in the bazedoxifene groups, compared with placebo, who had an ALT or AST level 
≥ 5 x ULN. There were small, statistically significant mean decreases from baseline in haemoglobin 
level, haematocrit level, and RBC count observed in the bazedoxifene and placebo groups; the 
decrease from baseline was greater in the bazedoxifene groups compared with placebo. These 
decreases did not appear to have clinical consequences. After both 36 and 60 months of treatment, 
there was no increased incidence of TEAEs of anaemia or withdrawals due to anaemia in the 
bazedoxifene groups compared with placebo. Bazedoxifene was associated with significant increases in 
HDL-C and significant decreases in LDL-C levels compared to placebo. At the end of 5 years there were 
no significant differences among the treatment groups in the mean changes from baseline in pulse, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, height, weight, and BMI. In the ECG substudy no safety signal 
was detected for QT interval prolongation with bazedoxifene use. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
A total of 971 (17.2%) subjects had AEs as the primary reason for withdrawal from study. Overall, no 
significant difference was observed among the 3 groups in the total number of AEs that were listed as 
the primary reason for withdrawal. Of the subjects in the bazedoxifene and placebo groups who 
participated in Extension I, 187 (5.9%) had AEs as the primary reason resulting in withdrawal from 
study, and there were no significant differences among the groups in either the total number of 
subjects who had an AE as primary reason for withdrawal or in the numbers withdrawing because of 
any specific AE. There were significant differences among groups in the number of subjects whose 
primary reason for withdrawal included the following events accidental injury, DVT, leg cramps, 
respiratory failure, and vasodilatation, which occurred more frequently in both bazedoxifene groups, 
and endometrial carcinoma and osteoporosis, which occurred more frequently in the placebo group. 
Overall, the AEs associated with withdrawal from the study noted after 60 months were consistent with 
those reported for the 36-month core study.

Changes to the Product Information 
Following the assessment of the data from the extension phase I of the pivotal Study 301-WW, 
sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC have been updated with further safety and efficacy 
information after long-term treatment for up to 5-years. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update Annex II with the standard DDPS wording, to 
update the annexes in line with the current QRD template, version 7.3.1 and the Guideline on 
Summary of Product Characteristics, revision 2, and to update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet. 
All these changes to the product information are acceptable.

Benefit/ Risk assessment 
With reference to the primary endpoint ‘subject incidence of new vertebral fractures’ the treatment 
effect was sustained through 60 months of treatment and the difference in the incidence in new 
vertebral fractures remained significantly lower in the bazedoxifene treatment groups compared to 
placebo.  
However, in contrast to the results of the core study bazedoxifene did not show even a numerical 
effect on the incidence of NVF compared to placebo. Also in the post-hoc analysis of NVF in a high risk 
subgroup defined as subjects with a femoral neck T-score of ≤ -3, or the presence of at least 1 
moderate vertebral fracture, or multiple vertebral fractures at baseline, there was no statistically 
significant difference in the incidence of NVF at 60 months, compared to a statistically significant 
difference at 36 and 48 months of treatment.  
Regarding BMD, statistically significant increases from baseline of the lumbar spine were seen in both 
bazedoxifene groups; the mean percent change from baseline reached a maximum between months 12 
and 18 and was sustained through month 60. Increases from baseline in BMD were also noted for the 
placebo group; after reaching a first maximum at month 12, the BMD in the placebo group showed 
further increases at months 36, 48, and 60. Mean percentage changes from baseline in BMD of the 
total hip were different from that in the placebo group. However, all groups showed a decline in total 
hip BMD from about 12 month onward.

The effects on biochemical markers of bone metabolism serum osteocalcin and sCTx as well as the 
effects on the lipid profile were maintained throughout the trial extension. 
While a numerically lower incidence of breast cancer with bazedoxifene compared to placebo was found 
at the end of the core study, this effect has not been seen during Extension I. 
In summary, the efficacy results of Extension I are in line with those of the core study, with a 
reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures, an increased BMD relative to placebo, and a 
reduced rate of bone turnover with bazedoxifene treatment compared to placebo. 
In terms of safety, 7609 subjects were enrolled in study 301 overall; the safety population of the 3 
year core study included 7492 women, of whom 3758 were treated with bazedoxifene. The 24-month 
Extension I includes 3146 subjects, of whom 2088 were treated with bazedoxifene. It is agreed that 
the AEs reported during Extension I do not raise any new safety concerns and that the AE profile is 
comparable between the core study and extension I. 
Regarding AE death and other SAEs, the safety results of extension I do not indicate new, currently 
unknown risks. There were more deaths in the bazedoxifene groups compared to placebo but the 
number of deaths was higher in the raloxifene group compared to either bazedoxifene group.  
As in the core study the incidence of VTEs was higher in the bazedoxifene groups compared to placebo.  
Regarding cardiovascular AEs no difference was observed in the overall incidence between 
bazedoxifene and placebo. Similar to the results of the core study the incidences of vasodilatation and 
leg cramps were significantly higher in the bazedoxifene groups compared to placebo. The analysis of 
AEs of the reproductive system, the analysis of laboratory AEs, and the analysis of discontinuations 
due to AEs did not reveal new safety findings. 
The MAH has made a commitment to include depression as a potential risk in the RMP and has 
committed to present a cumulative review of spontaneous reports and interim data from the ongoing 
study extension phase II as a follow-up measure. Currently no changes to the Product Information in 
this regard are considered necessary. 
In summary, the safety findings of Extension I are in line with the findings of the core study. 
The overall benefit-risk balance is not altered by the results of Extension I of study 301-WW.

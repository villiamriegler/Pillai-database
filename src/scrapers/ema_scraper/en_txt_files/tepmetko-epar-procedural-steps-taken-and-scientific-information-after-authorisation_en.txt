SmPC, Annex 
SmPC new text 
order to remove the warnings on interactions with 
II and PL 
Based on the final results of drug-drug interactions studies, 
‘CYP and P-gp inducers’ and ‘dual strong CYP3A and 
P-gp inhibitors, and P-gp inhibitors’ and to update 
pharmacokinetic information based on final results 
from the drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies 
sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated 
in order to delete the warning that concomitant use of 
TEPMETKO with strong CYP and P gp inducers or dual 
strong CYP3A and P gp inhibitors should be avoided. These 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

MS200095-0051 and MS200095-0053. Study 
MS200095-0051 is a phase 1, open-label, single-
sequence, cross-over study to evaluate the effect of 
multiple doses of carbamazepine on single-dose 
tepotinib pharmacokinetics in healthy participants, 
while study MS200095-0053 is a phase 1, open-
label, single-sequence, cross-over study to evaluate 
the effect of multiple doses of itraconazole on single-
dose tepotinib pharmacokinetics in healthy 
participants. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to introduce minor changes to the PI and 
to remove a sentence from the annex II section 
about PSURs, as the first PSUR was submitted in due 
time in June 2022.

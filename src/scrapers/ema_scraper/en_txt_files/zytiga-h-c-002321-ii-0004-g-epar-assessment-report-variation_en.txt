2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among 
males in most Western countries. In 2008, 323,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in the 
European Union and 71,000 patients died from the disease (GLOBOCAN 2008 (IARC)). 
For men with disseminated disease, bone is the most common site of metastasis. Prostate cancer-
related deaths occur as a result of complications of metastatic disease. The objective of therapy is 
control of disease while maintaining quality of life. The initial approach is generally androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT). Despite hormonal therapy, most patients with disease recurrence will 
progress within 12 to 18 months.  
Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is defined by disease progression despite androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) and may present as either a continuous rise in serum prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) levels, the progression of preexisting disease, and/or the appearance of new 
metastases. 
Based on the results of 2 randomised controlled trials, it is currently recommended that for men with 
clinical or biochemical evidence of progression and evidence of metastases, treatment with docetaxel 
75 mg/m2 administered intravenously every 3 weeks with 5 mg oral prednisone twice daily should be 
offered to improve overall survival, disease control, symptom palliation and quality of life (Tannock et 
al, 2004; Petrylak et al, 2004). 
Treatment options for symptomatic bone disease are radiation or radionuclide agents and 
bisphosphonates or the RANK ligand inhibitor, denosumab. However, the prognosis of mCRPC patients 
is still poor, with a median survival of approximately 1 to 2 years. 
Abiraterone acetate is a prodrug of abiraterone, an orally active inhibitor of the enzyme, CYP17α (17α-
hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase). Abiraterone acts as an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor by blocking two 
important enzymatic activities in the synthesis of testosterone in the testes, adrenals, and within the 
prostate tumour. 
Zytiga contains abiraterone and it was approved in the EU on 5 September 2011, in combination with 
prednisone or prednisolone, for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC) in adult men whose disease has progressed on or after a docetaxel-based chemotherapy 
regimen. The recommended dose is 1000 mg (four 250 mg tablets) given once daily. 
With this group of variation applications, the MAH proposed to extend the approved mCRPC indication 
to include the treatment of metastatic CRPC in adult men who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic 
after failure of androgen deprivation therapy. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated 
accordingly. In the second variation in the group, updates to sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC have 
been proposed based on the results of reproductive and developmental non-clinical studies. Minor 
modifications the SmPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet have also been proposed.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical information contained in this application summarised new data from additional primary 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies which included reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies submitted as a second type II variation in the group of variation. 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) was submitted in support of the extension of indication 
application. In the course of the assessment, a further updated ERA was submitted in MAH’s response 
to a CHMP recommendation at the time of the Marketing Authorisation. The assessment of this 
information was integrated into the assessment of environmental aspects of this application. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The Applicant has provided an update of primary pharmacology data on abiraterone acetate available 
from recent literature reports (Mostaghel EA et al, 2011; Cai C et al, 2011; Soifer HS et al, 2012; 
Richards J et al, 2012). The pharmacology data obtained from these publications provided evidence 
that abiraterone reduces CRPC growth via suppression of CYP17-mediated intratumoural androgen 
biosynthesis and regulation of androgen receptor activity. By targeting CYP17, resistance to 
abiraterone may occur through upregulation of CYP17 and/or induction of androgen receptor and 
androgen receptor splice variants. These findings are in line with earlier data described in the 
marketing authorisation application for Zytiga. 
Moreover, findings of abiraterone inhibition of direct androgen receptor activation by agonists in cell 
culture studies suggest an additional pharmacological activity that could contribute to the antitumour 
activity of abiraterone. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate has been studied in additional pharmacokinetic and 
toxicokinetic studies. These included exposure evaluation of abiraterone and abiraterone acetate in 
vivo after single and repeated administration of abiraterone acetate to transgenic mice, pregnant rats 
and juvenile rats. For pharmacokinetic modelling purposes, pharmacokinetics and plasma levels of 
abiraterone acetate and of abiraterone were studied after i.v. administration to beagle dogs. In 
addition, pharmacokinetics and plasma levels of abiraterone were studied after i.v. dosing of 
abiraterone to beagle dogs. Presystemic elimination of abiraterone acetate and abiraterone was studied 
in portal-vein catheterised dogs after administration of abiraterone acetate (data not shown, see 
discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
In two in vitro pharmacokinetic drug interactions studies, the potential of abiraterone acetate and 
abiraterone to inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 was evaluated using pooled human liver 
microsomes. Both abiraterone acetate and abiraterone were strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 with 50% 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 1.3 and 1.6 μM, respectively and both were weak inhibitors 
of CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 with IC50 ≥10 μM, the highest soluble concentration. Based on the extremely 
low human plasma concentrations of abiraterone acetate (<0.01 μM), no interaction of abiraterone 
acetate with CYP2C8 is expected. However, taking into account peak plasma concentrations of 
abiraterone up to 0.6 μM (clinical study COU-AA-006) and the in vitro IC50 of 1.6 μM, abiraterone has 
the potential to interact with CYP2C8.

2.2.4.  Toxicology 
A new repeat dose toxicity study, reproductive and developmental studies to assess the effects of 
abiraterone acetate and abiraterone on male and female fertility, embryo-foetal development and 
juvenile toxicity studies in rats, specific studies to evaluate the toxic potential of impurities and 
mechanistic studies to address effects of abiraterone acetate and abiraterone on different hormones 
have been submitted.

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the MAH has evaluated the environmental impact of abiraterone 
acetate for this new indication and submitted an updated ERA report. Moreover, during the procedure, 
the MAH submitted an extended partial life cycle study with fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 
aimed to assess the specific mode of action of abiraterone acetate according to the OECD 
recommendations for endocrine disrupting substances. This study had been recommended by the 
CHMP in conclusion to the assessment of the Marketing Authorisation application of Zytiga. The study 
was submitted with a further updated ERA report in which the toxicity NOEC was further refined to 
0.013 μg/L based on the study above. In the same report, the PECsurfacewater was further refined to 
0.005 μg/L, which is below the 0.01 μg/L threshold triggering a phase II assessment, but the phase II

2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The new pharmacokinetic studies showed that abiraterone acetate is rapidly converted to abiraterone 
in mice, rats and dogs. This is consistent with the findings described in the marketing authorisation 
application in humans and all animal species (mice, rats and monkeys). 
In portal-vein-catheterised beagle dogs, abiraterone was the main dose-related entity found in the 
portal vein after abiraterone acetate administration, indicating that abiraterone acetate was extensively 
hydrolysed to abiraterone during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.  
Abiraterone acetate is expected to have no clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) as the exposure to 
abiraterone acetate is extremely low. On the other hand and based on therapeutic plasma 
concentrations of abiraterone and in vitro IC50 values, abiraterone is expected to be a weak inhibitor 
of CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 and a potentially strong inhibitor of CYP2C8. In contrast with CYP1A2 and 
CYP2D6, for which abiraterone was also a potent in vitro inhibitor, no clinical DDI study has been 
submitted for CYP2C8. 
The MAH submitted additional toxicology studies conducted in the course of development and which 
expand the toxicological information for Zytiga. These studies do not give rise to any concern. 
However, in study TOX10066, 2 females of the group treated with 300 mg/kg of abiraterone acetate 
were found dead on day 20 of pregnancy and in study TOX10115 3 females of the group treated with 
Assessment report  
Page 11/52 
 
 
 
 
  
 
100 mg/kg of abiraterone acetate were sacrificed or found dead on day 18-21 of pregnancy. Therefore, 
pregnant rats may be more sensitive to abiraterone acetate than non-pregnant rats. Moreover, 
developmental or reproductive toxicology studies are not required for the approved and the proposed 
indication for Zytiga. Fertility studies are not required for late stage or advanced cancer patients, as 
detailed in the ICH S9 guideline (EMEA/CHMP/ICH/646107/2008) and embryofoetal toxicity studies are 
not applicable for Zytiga as it is administered to adult men strictly.  
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted. At the time of the marketing authorisation, the MAH 
committed to submit the data of a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study and a 6-month carcinogenicity 
study in the transgenic Tg.rasH2 mouse. These studies are included in the RMP as additional 
pharmacovigilance activities and the results are expected by 2Q 2013 and 3Q/4Q 2012, respectively. 
The MAH informed that the submission of the mouse study is imminent, in compliance with the due 
date in the RMP. 
The information regarding environmental aspects is considered adequate. The ERA indicates that the 
proposed use of abiraterone acetate is unlikely to represent a risk to the environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The studies submitted added to the knowledge of non-clinical aspects for Zytiga. There are no 
remaining non-clinical issues.  Considering the above data, abiraterone acetate is not expected to pose 
a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This variation application to extend the indication of Zytiga, in combination with prednisone or 
prednisolone, to the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer in adult men who are 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy, is based on the 
results of pivotal study COU-AA-302. Phase 1 studies (COU-AA-015 and COU-AA-006) and phase 1/2 
studies (COU-AA-001 (and EXT), COU-AA-002, COU-AA-003 (and EXT), COU-AA-BMA, COU-AA-BE) of 
abiraterone (acetate) in the new target population of chemotherapy naïve patients, supported the 
initial marketing authorisation application for Zytiga and were described therein. 
GCP 
The  Clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.    
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of abiraterone after oral administration of abiraterone acetate was previously described in both 
healthy subjects and in subjects with mCRPC who had already received docetaxel-based chemotherapy 
using a NONMEM approach. A 2-compartment model with first order elimination was used to describe 
the disposition of the compound. A 3-compartment transit model was used to characterise the 
systemic absorption of the drug. The administration of abiraterone acetate with or without food 
affected the values of absorption-related parameters. In general, the administration of abiraterone 
acetate with a meal significantly increased the systemic exposure to abiraterone. In addition, subjects 
with mCRPC who had already received docetaxel-based chemotherapy had a CL/F mean value 
Assessment report  
Page 12/52 
 
 
  
 
approximately 33% lower than healthy subjects. None of the other demographic characteristics 
evaluated significantly influenced the PK of abiraterone. 
Additional PK information from the pivotal study of this application, COU-AA-302, was used in updated 
analyses of PK data submitted. These updated analyses were focused on the evaluation of the PK of 
1,000 mg abiraterone acetate administered orally once daily and specifically on the assessment of PK 
differences between patients with mCRPC who had previously received docetaxel with those who had 
not received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
The population pharmacokinetic model previously developed was used as the basis of the current 
analysis, which is a 2-compartment model with first order elimination. A 3-compartment transit model 
was used to characterise the systemic absorption of the drug (see Figure 1). 
Figure 1: Schematic of the population pharmacokinetic model 
The covariates identified in the previous population pharmacokinetic analysis were included in the 
current model: food-intake was considered consistent with the modified-fasting condition and all 
patients enrolled in Study COU-AA-302 were patients with mCRPC. In addition to the already known 
effect of these covariates, potential differences between the mCRPC patients who had (in Studies COU-
AA-006 and COU-AA-301) or had not (in Study COU-AA-302) received prior chemotherapy were 
evaluated. 
All parameters obtained were consistent with those obtained in the previous population PK analysis. 
Abiraterone PK was confirmed to be characterised by an extensive CL/F and large V2/F and V3/F. 
Absorption-related parameters were confirmed to be affected by the intake of a meal, and in particular 
by the fat content of the meal (data not shown). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK assessment of abiraterone acetate in chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC who are 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic indicated no significant differences compared with patients with 
mCRPC who had received prior docetaxel-based chemotherapy. This conclusion is based on the 
following: 
• 
• 
The exploratory analysis, where the observations from subjects in Study COU-AA-302 were 
well described by the VPC based on the previously developed model using PK data collected 
from subjects with mCRPC who had received prior chemotherapy 
The external validation procedure based on the previously developed model, in which the 
calculated prediction errors were well within the predefined threshold levels;  
Assessment report  
Page 13/52 
 
 
 
 
  
 
• 
• 
The model fit of all the available data (final model run), providing estimates of the PK 
parameters not showing large differences from those estimated based on the previous PK 
modeling exercise; 
The model fit including 2 distinct CL/F terms for the 2 subpopulations, which did not 
significantly improve the model compared with the one in which the 2 subject populations were 
considered homogeneous. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
This application in support of the approval of “abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone (or 
prednisolone) for the treatment of chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) who progress after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and who are 
asymptomatic or mild symptomatic” is mainly based on 3 studies: COU-AA-001/EXT, COU-AA-002 and 
COU-AA-302. 
The pivotal study is COU-AA-302 a phase 3, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo 
controlled study conducted at 151 study sites in the US, Europe and Australia comparing the efficacy 
and safety of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone with placebo plus prednisone in medically or 
surgically castrated asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic men with mCRPC who have not received 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. Planned enrolment was approximately 1,000 subjects. Subjects were 
stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status Grade (0 
versus 1) and were then assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone or placebo plus prednisone. 
Studies COU-AA-001/EXT, COU-AA-002 are phase 1/2, open label, single arm, dose-escalation studies 
investigating abiraterone acetate therapy in men with CRPC who had no previous chemotherapy for 
prostate cancer. They were also submitted and assessed during the MAA procedure. 
Study COU-AA-301 conducted in patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel is considered 
as supportive studies in the current proposed indication. 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No new studies have been carried out in the claimed population (see discussion on Clinical efficacy). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
COU-AA-302 
This was a phase III, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study conducted at 
151 study sites in the US, Europe and Australia comparing the efficacy and safety of abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone with placebo plus prednisone in medically or surgically castrated asymptomatic 
or mildly symptomatic men with mCRPC who had not received cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Treatments 
Patients were randomised to receive abiraterone 1000 mg (4x 250 mg tablets) or 4x placebo tablets 
orally once daily and prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily. Prednisolone was used in 
Europe. Placebo was supplied by the sponsor as a tablet formulation matching abiraterone tablets in 
size, colour and shape. Treatment was to be initiated within 72 hours (3 calendar days) of 
randomisation. Treatment was administered on a continuous schedule and each cycle of treatment was 
considered to be 28 days. In line with the current recommendations in the SmPC, food was not to be 
consumed for at least 2 hours before and for at least 1 hour after the study drug.  
Patients were to receive treatment until documented disease progression (radiographic or unequivocal 
clinical progression [need to discontinue due to cancer pain requiring immediate administration of 
chronic opiate analgesics, deterioration of ECOG PS to Grade 3 or higher or immediate need to initiate 
cytotoxic chemotherapy or have either radiation therapy or surgical intervention for complications due 
to tumour progression]), unacceptable toxicity or a decision by the subject to discontinue study 
treatment. Study medication was to continue in those subjects who had increasing PSA values in the 
absence of radiographic or unequivocal clinical progression. If a subject experienced radiographic 
progression in the absence of unequivocal clinical progression, the subject could continue on study 
medication at investigator discretion until signs of unequivocal clinical progression were evident. Cross-
over at disease progression of patients in the placebo arm to the abiraterone arm of the study was not 
permitted.

Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the clinical benefit of abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone to placebo plus prednisone in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic 
chemotherapy-naïve metastatic CRPC. 
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
• 
• 
• 
To establish additional clinically relevant improvements in prostate cancer subjects treated with 
abiraterone acetate in comparison with placebo 
To characterise the safety profile of abiraterone acetate in this subject population  
To characterise the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate when administered concurrently 
with prednisone 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The study had two co-primary endpoints: radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall 
survival (OS). 
rPFS was defined as the time from randomisation to the first occurrence of 1 of the following: disease 
progression by bone scan (according to modified PCWG2 criteria), progression by CT or MRI (according 
to modified RECIST) or death (independent radiographic review of sequential imaging assessments). 
The determination of rPFS was adapted from defined criteria formulated by the PCWG2 to enhance the 
reliability and objectivity of the endpoint. These criteria required bone scans to be performed at an 
increased frequency (every 8 weeks) for the first 24 weeks (6 cycles) of the study and confirmatory 
bone scans of new lesions performed to minimise the false positive rate. Additionally, to avoid bias, the 
scans were reviewed by an independent assessor, blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment, 
clinical information (signs and symptoms data as well as clinical laboratory data, including PSA 
concentrations) and progression status. 
Assessment report  
Page 17/52 
 
 
 
  
 
OS was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of death regardless of cause. Overall 
survival was determined by investigator observation during the treatment period and follow-up period. 
Secondary endpoints included: time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to opiate use for 
cancer pain, time to ECOG PS deterioration by at least 1 grade, time to PSA progression, PSA response 
rate, objective response rate (by independent review), patient-reported outcome measures (PRO), 
biomarker data (selected sites only) and safety parameters. 
Sample size 
The overall level of significance for the study was 0.05, which was allocated between the co-primary 
endpoints (0.01 for rPFS and 0.04 for OS). The exact timing of the analysis was carried out according 
to the pre-specified number of events for each endpoint. The median rPFS was estimated at 
approximately 4 months, while the estimated median OS for this population has been reported to be in 
the range of 20 to 22 months. With a planned sample size of approximately 1,000 subjects, and an 
estimated enrollment rate of 50 subjects per month (20 months to complete enrollment), a study 
duration of approximately 64 months was planned for the study. 
One analysis of rPFS was planned. Assuming that the hazards for the 2 treatment groups follow a 
proportional hazard model, it was estimated that 378 rPFS events would be required to provide 91% 
power in detecting a median rPFS of 4 months in the placebo group compared with 6 months for the 
abiraterone acetate group (HR=0.667) at a 2-tailed level of significance of 0.01. 
Assuming that the hazards for the 2 treatment groups would follow a proportional hazards model for 
OS, the test to detect a difference between a median OS of 22 months in the placebo group and a 
median OS of 27.5 months in the abiraterone acetate group (HR=0.80) at a 2-tailed significance level 
of 0.04 with a power of 85%, would require 773 events. 
Randomisation 
Patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive either abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or 
placebo plus prednisone. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
The ITT population was used for all efficacy analyses, and all analyses of disposition, demographic, and 
baseline disease characteristics. The primary analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
was based on the stratified log rank test; sensitivity analyses using the non-stratified log rank test, 
and Cox proportional hazards model also were performed as supportive analyses. Distribution curve, 
median and 95% confidence interval for the co-primary endpoints were estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method.  
Only 1 analysis was planned for the co-primary rPFS endpoint. The OS endpoint incorporated group 
sequential design by including 3 interim analyses and one final analysis using the O’Brien-Fleming 
boundaries as implemented by Lan-DeMets alpha spending method to ensure that the type I error rate 
was not inflated.

A post hoc analysis was performed for the deterioration in ECOG performance status grade by ≥1 grade with 
confirmation of deterioration at the next visit. This analysis addresses potential transient fluctuations in 
performance status. 
With regard to other secondary efficacy parameters: 
- A confirmed PSA response was observed in 62% of subjects in the abiraterone group and 24% of 
subjects in the placebo group (p<0.0001). 
- Objective response rate results by RECIST in patients with measurable disease at baseline and based 
on independent review were as follows:

- Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) and 
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate (FACT-P) instrument. 
For both treatment groups, the cumulative compliance rate for completion of the BPI-SF was 95% or 
greater for every assessment. Treatment with abiraterone significantly reduced the risk of average 
pain intensity progression by 18% compared with placebo (HR=0.817; 95% CI: 0.668, 0.999; 
p=0.0490). The median time to average pain intensity progression was 26.7 months in the abiraterone 
group and 18.4 months in the placebo group. 
Treatment with abiraterone decreased the risk of FACT-P (Total Score) degradation by 22% compared 
with placebo (HR=0.778; 95% CI: 0.659, 0.918; p=0.0028). The median time to degradation was 
12.7 months in the abiraterone group and 8.3 months in the placebo group.

A delay in median time to average pain intensity progression of >8 months and >4 month delay in the 
degradation in the FACT-P (Total Score) was observed, indicating that quality of life was generally 
preserved in those subjects treated with abiraterone.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Earlier dose escalation studies of up to 2,000 mg per day presented in the initial dossier showed that 
the MTD for abiraterone acetate was not reached. Additionally, the 1,000 mg oral daily dose 
administered as four 250 mg tablets was chosen for study based upon pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic and efficacy data and was approved to treat men with mCRPC who had received 
Assessment report  
Page 31/52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
prior docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Ten (10) mg prednisone (or prednisolone) daily is administered 
concurrently to ameliorate mineralocorticoid-related toxicities that were observed in earlier studies of 
abiraterone acetate. This same dosing regimen was used for the studies that support this application 
which extends the observations of treatment benefits to chemotherapy naïve patients with mCRPC. 
Studies COU-AA-001, COU-AA-001EXT and COU-AA-002 were conducted in men with CRPC who had 
no previous chemotherapy for prostate cancer. These studies were submitted to support the dosing in 
the initial dossier. Of note, the dose chosen has demonstrated to improve the life expectancy in those 
patients pre-treated with docetaxel.  
Thus and taken together, the current authorised dosing is considered acceptable for this new 
indication: “1,000 mg administered orally once daily in combination with 5 mg prednisone or 
prednisolone twice daily. ZYTIGA must be taken without food and on an empty stomach as taking 
ZYTIGA with food increases systemic exposure. Therefore, no food should be consumed for at least 2 
hours prior and 1 hour after the dose of ZYTIGA is taken”. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
COU-AA-302 was a phase 3, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study in which 
most of the comments and discussion during the CHMP Scientific Advice were considered.  
Eligible patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic [0-1 or 2-3 BPI-SF] subjects with 
metastatic [bone (scan), soft tissue (CT, MRI) or Node (> 2cm Ø)] castration [surgical or LHRH; serum 
testosterone < 50 ng/dL] – resistant [antiandrogens followed by PSA progression] prostate cancer, 
who had evidence of tumor progression [PSA (PCWG2) or radiographic (modified RECIST)]. Prior 
cytotoxic chemotherapy or biologic therapy was not allowed. ECOG Grade 0 or 1 was allowed.  
These inclusion-exclusion criteria had the aim of recruiting asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic 
chemotherapy naïve mCRPC patients after failure of androgen deprivation therapy. Traditionally, 
patients with clear clinical and radiological progression are candidates to receive chemotherapy, usually 
docetaxel based therapy. However, patients with metastasis (no progression) but without clinical 
symptomatology are not treated with docetaxel and have limited alternative therapeutic options. 
Several symptomatic patients (7.5% with >4 BPI-SF baseline) were included in the study. This number 
could be even higher since the use of opiate analgesics (not allowed for cancer related pain but  
allowed for non-cancer related pain) may have modified the pain perception from the patient who 
received opiate analgesic [28 patients (~3%)]. However, to obtain a representative patient population 
in this respect is practically difficult considering the real clinical practice. Importantly, the proportion of 
patients under the mentioned circumstances (7.5% >4 BPI-SF at baseline and ~3% who received 
opiate analgesic) was relative low. Therefore, this issue was considered resolved. 
Regarding the comparator, prednisolone/prednisolone alone can be considered as an appropriate 
comparator, since there are few data on the safety of combinations of other secondary agents with 
prednisone and globally no consensus standard of care for best second line hormonal therapy. In 
addition, the use of corticoids in prostate cancer has been explored in several studies  which have 
highlighted its antitumor effects and palliative activity. 
The main endpoints of the pivotal study were radiologic progression free survival (rPFS) and overall 
survival (OS) as co-primary endpoints and three key secondary endpoints which capture the main 
clinical progressions: time to opiate use for cancer pain, time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
and time to clinical deterioration in ECOG performance status by > 1 grade. Other efficacy endpoints 
were also included. During the discussion meeting of CHMP Scientific Advice, it was discussed that a 
global endpoint capturing all events (global PFS) could be preferred to a free combination of endpoints, 
Assessment report  
Page 32/52 
 
 
  
 
one being primary the other ones being secondary. In the end, agreement was reached on the 
proposed primary endpoint and on the fact that at least two of the three secondary endpoints related 
to a clinical benefit should be positive in order to consider the whole study as an acceptable evidence 
for a clinical benefit. 
Only 1 analysis was planned for the co-primary rPFS endpoint (378 events), while three interim 
analyses [15%, 40% and 55% of total death events (773)] were pre-planned for OS. The purpose of 
the planned interim analyses was to allow the early termination of the study if superiority was 
irrefutably demonstrated, while the collection of survival data was continued. Amendments to the 
protocol had to be implemented to modify the initial planned interim analyses for OS and to introduce 
additional analyses so as to assess the crossover effect after the authorisation of abiraterone acetate 
for the treatment of mCRPC after docetaxel. Finally, after the second interim analysis, the IDMC 
recommended unblinding the treatment and allowing cross-over of subjects. Eventually, the proposed 
trial design makes the collection of clear and unbiased data for OS difficult. However and overall, the 
study appears to have been well-conducted and well-documented. No critical GCP issues have been 
highlighted during the assessment review. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The efficacy results showed that:  
- 
Abiraterone acetate substantially decreased the risk of radiographic progression or death (rPFS), 
58% compared with placebo (HR=0.425; 95% CI: 0.347, 0.522; p<0.0001). Although the median rPFs 
in the abiraterone acetate arm (8.2 months in placebo arm) was not reached as of cut-off 
(20 December 2010), the robustness of the rPFS result is supported by the consistency between the 
independent and investigator assessment and the several sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The 
reduction in risk of progression was broadly maintained after an additional year (20 December 2011, 
investigator review, HR=0.530; CI: 0.451, 0.623; <0.0001) and rPFS was 16.5 months in the 
abiraterone group and 8.3 months in the placebo group. 
- 
Upon submission of this application and based on the second interim analysis, overall survival 
data (HR=0.752; 95% CI: 0.606, 0.934; p=0.0097) showed a trend in the same direction as rPFS, 
although data were too immature to be considered conclusive. The median OS was still not reached in 
the abiraterone acetate group and was 27.24 months in placebo arm. The analysis did not reach the 
pre-specified statistical significance. In the third interim analysis median OS was 35.3 months (95% 
CI: 31.24, 35.29) in the abiraterone group and 30.1 months (95% CI: 27.30, 34.10) in the placebo 
group, HR was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.655, 0.956; p=0.0151). A favourable trend in the treatment effect of 
abiraterone on OS continues to be observed at this analysis.  
- 
Results from the secondary endpoints support the benefit observed for the co-primary endpoints. 
Opiate use was documented for fewer subjects in the abiraterone group (34% vs. 43%). The  median  
time  to  initiation  of  cytotoxic chemotherapy was more than 8 months longer in the abiraterone 
group (25.2 months) compared with the placebo group (16.8 months). The prolongation in the time to 
initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy is consistent with the delay of disease progression. The time to 
deterioration of ECOG PS was statistically significant but the difference between the medians was 
moderate (12.3 months vs. 10.9 months).  The median time to PSA progression was significantly 
longer and a confirmed PSA response was observed in more subjects in the abiraterone group. Over 
twice as many abiraterone treated subjects with measurable disease at baseline had an objective 
response. For PRO data, a delay in median time to average pain intensity progression of >8 months 
and a >4 month delay in the degradation in the FACT-P (Total Score) was observed for the abiraterone 
treated group compared to placebo. Biomarker data have not been presented.

The results from the biomarker analysis will be submitted by the MAH in 2013. A report describing the 
analysis of the TMPRSS2-ERG biomarker with correlations to clinical endpoints will be submitted no 
later than 31 March 2013. The statistical analysis and correlation of these results with the clinical data 
are currently in progress. A separate report describing the analysis of microRNA and mRNA will be 
completed and submitted no later than 20 December 2013. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The prognosis of mCRPC patients is still poor (median survival of approximately 1 to 2 year). After 
patients become castration resistant, different hormonal managements can be used. However, globally 
there is neither clear consensus nor clear proof of efficacy of available treatments. Abiraterone acetate 
represents an option for this patient population.  
Results were consistently favourable through the different analysis of rPFS and secondary endpoints. 
OS data though immature, tend to show a positive trend. Of note, it is highly unlikely to obtain 
unbiased OS data from this study in the future, due to crossover of patients in the placebo arm to the 
abiraterone arm after IDMC recommendation for unblinding the study.  
In summary, abiraterone has demonstrated to improve the rPFS and the quality of life of 
chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients. Unfortunately, OS data may be affected by cross-over and 
hence, unequivocal evidence of increasing the life expectancy of abiraterone treated patients cannot be 
provided at this time. Nevertheless, taking into account the strong trend in OS and the fact that 
abiraterone has already demonstrated to increase the survival in post-chemotherapy setting, it does 
not seem unrealistic to believe that this treatment could improve the survival of pre-chemotherapy 
patients.  
The CHMP recommends the following measures to be undertaken: 
- To conduct an analysis of the TMPRSS2-ERG biomarker with correlations to clinical endpoints 
- To conduct an analysis of microRNA and mRNA: 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Safety evaluation in the claimed indication is based on data from patients enrolled and treated in study 
COU-AA-302. The safety profile of abiraterone was examined using: 
•  Analyses of safety data from the integrated safety population (Study COU-AA-301 and Study COU-
AA-302) - 2,267 subjects with mCRPC: 1,333 subjects treated with abiraterone (791 subjects from 
Study COU-AA-301 and 542 subjects from Study COU-AA-302) and 934 control subjects treated 
with placebo (394 subjects from Study COU-AA-301 and 540 subjects from Study COU-AA-302) 
•  ADR analysis in Study COU-AA-302 
•

Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported for a lower proportion of AA-treated subjects versus placebo-treated 
subjects in Study COU-AA-301 (60% versus 61%), but a higher proportion of AA-treated subjects 
versus placebo-treated subjects in Study COU-AA-302 (48% versus 42%). The 5 most frequently 
reported AEs of Grade 3 or 4 for the combined treatment groups were fatigue, back pain, anemia, bone 
pain, and arthralgia. With the exception of pulmonary embolism, which was reported in 1.4% of 
subjects in the combined placebo group, no individual Grade 4 AE was reported in ≥1% of subjects in 
either combined treatment group. 
In Study COU-AA-302, the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs (reported in ≥3% of subjects in 
either the abiraterone acetate or placebo group) were hypertension (4% versus 3%), back pain (3% 
versus 4%), alanine aminotransferase increased (5.4% versus 0.7%), and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased (3.0% versus 0.9%). Of note, Grade 3 and 4 AEs classified in the SOC of Cardiac Disorders 
were reported in 4% of subjects in the abiraterone group and 2% of subjects in the placebo group. 
Adrenal insufficiency was reported in no subject in the abiraterone acetate group and 1 subject in the 
placebo group. 
With regard to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and in order to assess the effect of the longer duration 
of exposure in the abiraterone groups, an analysis standardising for the difference in treatment 
duration was performed and reported as number of events per 100 patient-years (P-Y) of exposure 
(time on treatment). Adverse events with a difference of ≥5 events per 100 P-Y (abiraterone - 
placebo) were considered ADRs, provided that the criteria for relatedness outlined by the CIOMS 
Working Groups III and V3 (Evidence from Clinical Trials/Studies) were met. More than 1 event per 
patient may be included in this rate.  
Four new ADRs are proposed on the basis of Study COU-AA-302 data: dyspepsia, increased AST, rash 
and haematuria. The most common ADRs seen with abiraterone (based on all clinical studies 
combined) are peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, hypertension, urinary tract infection, haematuria, 
AST increased, ALT increased, dyspepsia and fractures.  
ADRs in the integrated safety population of studies COU-AA-301 and -302 are summarised in the 
following Table 19.

Adverse events of special interest were reported in 66% of subjects in the abiraterone group and 50% 
of subjects in the placebo group. In study COU-AA-301, such events were reported in 60% of subjects 
in the abiraterone group and 47% of subjects in the placebo group. 
Fluid retention/oedema events were reported in 28% of subjects in the abiraterone group and 24% of 
subjects in the placebo group. Most oedema AEs were Grade 1 or 2. No Grade 4 or 5 oedema events 
were reported. Serious fluid retention/oedema AEs were reported in 0.7% of subjects in both the 
abiraterone and placebo groups.  
Hypokalaemia was reported in 17% of subjects in the abiraterone group and 13% of subjects in the 
placebo group. Hypokalaemia events of Grade 3 or 4 were reported for 2% of subjects in both 
treatment groups. SAEs were reported in 0.4% of the abiraterone group and 0.2% of the placebo 
group. No AEs of hypokalaemia led to discontinuation of the study medication. After standardising for 
the difference in duration of treatment exposure, an excess of 2 hypokalaemia events/100 P-Y (for all 
grades) was observed in the abiraterone group (24 in the abiraterone group and 22 in the placebo 
group).  
Hypertension events were reported in 22% of subjects in the abiraterone group and 13% of subjects in 
the placebo group. No Grade 4 or 5 hypertensive events were reported. Grade 3 hypertensive events 
were reported in 4% of the abiraterone group and 3% of the placebo group. SAEs were reported less 
frequently in the abiraterone group (0.2% versus 0.6%). Difference in standardised rates was more 
pronounced for study COU-AA-302 (24 for the abiraterone group versus 20 for the placebo group) as 
compared with study COU-AA-301 (19 vs. 18). After standardising for the difference in duration of 
treatment exposure, an excess of 4 hypertension events/100 P-Y (for all grades) was observed in the 
abiraterone group (24 in the abiraterone group and 20 in the placebo group).  
Hepatotoxicity is a known risk of abiraterone treatment and increases in hepatic enzymes (ALT and 
AST) and bilirubin are observed. In study COU-AA-302, hepatotoxicity adverse events reported as LFT 
abnormalities were observed in 18% of subjects in the abiraterone group and 11% in the placebo 
group. The most frequently reported preferred terms were AST and ALT increases. ALT increases were 
12% in the abiraterone group compared with 5% in the placebo group and for AST 11% versus 5%.  
Grade 3 or 4 events of hepatotoxicity were reported in 8% of the abiraterone group versus 3% in the 
placebo group. Adverse events of hepatotoxicity leading to treatment discontinuation were reported at 
in 2.2% of the abiraterone group compared with 0.2% in the placebo group. No Grade 5 events of 
hepatotoxicity were reported and no cases meeting Hy’s law criteria were identified. Hepatotoxicity 
SAEs were reported in 1.1% of subjects in the abiraterone group and 0.6% of subjects in the placebo 
group. 
In contrast to study COU-AA-301, COU-AA-302 excluded subjects with New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) Class II heart failure. Cardiac disorders events were reported in 19% of subjects in the 
abiraterone group and 16% of subjects in the placebo group. The incidences of cardiac disorder AEs by 
subcategory were: 
•  Arrhythmias (abiraterone 14% vs. placebo 12%) 
• 
Ischaemic heart disease (abiraterone 4% vs. ischaemic 3%) 
•  Cardiac disorders for other causes (3% in each treatment group) 
•  Cardiac failure (abiraterone 2.0% vs. placebo 0.4%)  
Exposure-standardised rates (events of cardiac disorder per 100 P-Y) were lower for the abiraterone 
group (27/100 P-Y) compared with the placebo group (29/100P-Y) in study COU-AA-302 (the rates 
were higher for abiraterone in study COU-AA-301). A subject-level review of the cardiac failure events 
in study COU-AA-302 showed that most of the events were coincident with other cardiac events 
Assessment report

(ischaemic events, arrhythmia). Cardiac disorder events of Grade 3 or 4 were reported for 6% of 
subjects in the abiraterone group and 3% of subjects in the placebo group (Grade 5 events 0.6% vs. 
0.4%). Serious cardiac disorder events were reported in 7% of subjects in the abiraterone group and 
3% of subjects in the placebo group (arrhythmias 3% versus 2%, ischaemic heart disease 2.4% versus 
0.9%, cardiac failure 0.7% versus 0, cardiac disorders for other causes 0.4% in each treatment 
group). Cardiac disorder events led to treatment discontinuation in 0.6% of subjects the abiraterone 
group and 0.4% of subjects in the placebo group.  
ECGs were obtained pre-dose (at the screening visit) and at approximately 2 hours post-dose (at 
Cycles 1, 2, and 5). The proportion of subjects with QTc interval prolongation of either >30 ms or >60 
ms based on either method of correction was higher in the abiraterone group. Based on the QTcF 
method: 
•  16% of subjects in the abiraterone group had a QTc interval prolongation of >30 ms  
•  10% of subjects in the placebo group had a QTc interval prolongation of >30 ms 
•  6% of subjects in the abiraterone group had a QTc interval prolongation of >60 ms 
•  4% of subjects in the placebo group had a QTc interval prolongation of >60 ms 
Based on the QTcB method: 
•  24% of subjects in the abiraterone group had a QTc interval prolongation of >30 ms 
•  19% of subjects in the placebo group had a QTc interval prolongation of >30 ms 
•  8% of subjects in the abiraterone group had a QTc interval prolongation of >60 ms 
•  5% of subjects in the placebo group had a QTc interval prolongation of >60 ms 
Post-baseline QTcF values of >450 ms were higher in the abiraterone group than in the placebo group 
(27% versus 20%). 
7% of subjects in both treatment groups experienced an osteoporosis-related event.  
For squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, the imbalances observed in Study COU-AA-
301 were also observed in Study COU-AA-302. Overall, the numbers of events were low.  
Events of renal toxicity were reported for higher proportions of abiraterone treated patients versus 
placebo treated patients.  
Overall, the adverse events of special interest are generally in keeping with the known safety profile of 
abiraterone.

29% of subjects in the combined abiraterone group and 20% of subjects in the combined placebo 
group had Grade 3 or 4 serum chemistry laboratory abnormalities during treatment. Abnormalities in 
ALP were the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 serum chemistry laboratory abnormality. Grade 3 
or 4 phosphorus abnormalities were observed in 5% of the abiraterone group and 2% of the placebo 
group. 
29% of subjects in the combined abiraterone group and 17% of subjects in the combined placebo 
group had Grade 3 or 4 haematologic laboratory abnormalities during treatment. Lymphocyte 
abnormalities were the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 abnormality for the combined treatment 
groups.  
Most initial events of liver enzyme increase occurred within the first 3 months of abiraterone treatment 
(see adverse events of special interest).  
Generally, the findings are in keeping with previous observations. AST increased is included as a new 
ADR. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
•  Adverse Events by Age 
Patient age is not considered to be a significant prognostic factor in prostate cancer. Rates of AEs were 
generally higher in the subgroups with more advanced age.  
•  Adverse Events by Race 
The small proportions of non-white subjects enrolled preclude any meaningful comparisons of AE 
profiles analyzed by race. 
•  Adverse Events by Baseline ECOG Performance Status Grade 
Rates of AEs were generally higher in the subgroups with higher baseline ECOG performance status 
grade. 
•  Adverse Events by Baseline Hemoglobin 
Rates of AEs were generally higher in the subgroups with baseline hemoglobin concentration <12.5 
g/dL. 
•  Adverse Events by Baseline LDH 
Rates of AEs were generally higher in the subgroups with baseline LDH >1xULN. 
Extrinsic Factors 
•  Adverse Events by Geographic Region 
The overall safety profile analysed by geographic region (North America versus other 
[Europe/Australia]) has been provided. North American sites contributed 55% of subjects enrolled in 
Study COU-AA-301 and 52% of subjects enrolled in Study COU-AA-302. Within the Study COU-AA-301 
abiraterone acetate and placebo groups, lower rates of Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation were reported for the North America subgroup as compared with the 
Europe/Australia subgroup. No such pattern was seen for either treatment group in study COU-AA-302.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
An addendum of study COU-AA-015 was submitted within the current application. The effect of 
abiraterone acetate plus prednisone on a single dose of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan was 
investigated in this study. The systemic exposure (AUC) of dextromethorphan was increased 
approximately 2.9-fold. The AUC24 for dextrorphan, the active metabolite of dextromethorphan, 
increased approximately 33%. 
Caution is advised when abiraterone acetate is administered with medicinal products activated by or 
metabolised by CYP2D6, particularly with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index. 
Dose reduction of medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index that are metabolised by CYP2D6 
should be considered. Examples of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 include metoprolol, 
propranolol, desipramine, venlafaxine, haloperidol, risperidone, propafenone, flecainide, codeine, 
oxycodone, and tramadol (the final 3 products requiring CYP2D6 to form their active analgesic 
metabolites). 
Administration with food significantly increases the absorption of abiraterone acetate. The efficacy and 
safety of abiraterone acetate given with food have not been established. Abiraterone acetate must not 
be taken with food.

Post marketing experience 
The first marketing approval for abiraterone acetate was on 28 April 2011 in the United States. The 
estimated postmarketing exposure worldwide for abiraterone acetate from launch to 31 January 2012 
was 2,245,830 person-days. No new ADRs have been detected for abiraterone acetate from 
post-marketing data. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure to abiraterone in COU-AA-302 is considered sufficient for assessment of the safety profile for 
this application. The median treatment duration was longer in the abiraterone group compared to the 
placebo group and approximately twice as long as that in study COU-AA-301. The median treatment 
duration was 13.8 months in the abiraterone group and 8.3 months in the placebo group. Fewer 
subjects in the abiraterone group discontinued and the most common reason for treatment 
discontinuation was disease progression. 
Overall the adverse event profile is generally consistent with previous observations from study COU 
AA-301. A review performed by the MAH to identify any clinically meaningful new imbalances between 
studies identified dyspepsia, increased AST, rash and haematuria as new ADRs. 
In study 302, a higher rate of deaths within 30 days of last dose was observed in the abiraterone 
group and was considered of concern. Of them, death causes categorised as ‘other’ were higher in the 
abiraterone group [10 (1.8%) vs 4 (0.7%)]. Focusing on AEs leading to death, infections seem to be 
the most relevant AE; 5 patients in abiraterone arm (0.9%) vs none in the control. Although 
differences in the number of deaths between arms can hardly be considered simply due to chance, no 
clear pattern of causality can be observed, considering the underlying disease of the target population 
and co-morbidities of patients. 
Adverse events of special interest were generally in keeping with the known safety profile of 
abiraterone. As expected, mineralocorticoid-related toxicities such as fluid retention/oedema, 
hypokalaemia and hypertension were observed more frequently for subjects treated with abiraterone. 
However, protocol defined management strategies for hypokalaemia have been included in the SmPC. 
Although hepatotoxicity was associated with abiraterone treatment during the assessment of the 
marketing authorisation application, it appeared to be more notable in the population of study 302. 
Considering that TEAEs AST/ALT increases as well as Grade 3 and 4 AST/ALT increases were higher in 
study 302 and that liver metastasis was an exclusion criterion in study 302 (not in 301), differences 
were considered of importance. However, the higher hepatotoxicity could be related to the fact that 
patients were treated with abiraterone for a longer time in study 302. The actual mechanism of 
abiraterone hepatotoxicity is unknown and further information has been included in the SmPC to 
manage this risk. 
A higher rate of cardiac disorder events was noted and a warning regarding use of abiraterone in 
patients with a history of cardiovascular disease is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
With regards to the ECG data, the MAH continues to conduct ECG monitoring as part of the ongoing 
clinical development programme. This includes the following clinical studies: JPN-201, JPN-202 
(triplicate ECG), central reader], ABI-PRO-3002, and a study in breast cancer patients (BCA-2001). 
These studies include 700 to 800 additional subjects. The RMP has been updated to include these 
studies as additional pharmacovigilance activities for the identified risk of cardiac disorders.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Treatment with abiraterone was tolerable for the majority of subjects and the safety profile was 
consistent with previous experience (except for four new ADR identified - dyspepsia, AST increased, 
rash and haematuria). Adverse events were generally manageable and no major safety concerns have 
been raised by this application. 
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. The next data lock point will be 27 October 2012. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure.

As noted in the SmPC (Sections 4.4, 4.8, 
and 5.1), these adverse reactions 
are anticipated from the pharmacodynamic 
consequence of increased mineralocorticoid 
levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition, and 
are reduced in incidence and severity by 
co-administration of low-dose prednisone or 
prednisolone (10 mg daily); co-
administration of a corticosteroid 
suppresses ACTH drive. Guidance on 
management of Grade ≥ 3 toxicities is 
provided (SmPC Section 4.2).  
Additional guidance for the physician is also 
provided in Sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8 of 
the SmPC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information  
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The new indication was reflected in section 4.1 of the SmPC. Particularly, a new 
contraindication in patients with severe hepatic impairment has been added to section 4.3 of the 
SmPC. Posology recommendations and warnings related to heart failure, mineralocorticoid toxicities, 
hepatotoxicity and hepatic impairment have been updated in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC, 
accordingly. A new posology recommendation related to concomitant LHRH administration in patients 
not surgically castrated and new warnings related to hyperglycaemia, use with chemotherapy and 
potential risks of anaemia and sexual dysfunction have been introduced in the same sections. The 
existing warning in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease in section 4.4 of the SmPC has 
been updated. The newly identified ADRs of dyspepsia, haematuria, increased aspartate 
aminotransferase and rash, as well as safety information from the pivotal COU-AA-302 study were 
included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The pivotal efficacy information from the pivotal COU-AA-302 
study was included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Finally, in the description of pharmacokinetic 
information in patients with hepatic impairment in section 5.2 of the SmPC, cross reference to other 
SmPC sections has been updated (4.2) or included (4.3. and 4.4). 
In the second type II variation in the group of variation submitted, recommendations were updated in 
section 4.6 of the SmPC and the results from reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were 
included in secion 5.3. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated in accordance with the above changes to the SmPC. Finally, 
minor changes were made to the SmPC , Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to the existing Package Leaflet for Zytiga 250 mg tablets. 
The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
the differences found had little impact on readability. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for he 
representative of Cyprus. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
A single pivotal study supported this application. COU-AA-302 was a well-conducted and well-
documented study, no major GCP triggers have been revealed during the assessment of the dossier. 
The Applicant sought CHMP scientific advice regarding the overall design of the study and no major 
deviations from the scientific advice were noted. 
Treatment with abiraterone decreased the risk of radiographic progression or death by 58% compared 
with placebo and the reduction in risk of progression was maintained after an additional year of

follow-up.  The results were consistently favourable across analyses, demonstrating the robustness of 
the primary analysis. Treatment with abiraterone resulted in a 25% decrease in the risk of death, 
although the p-value did not reach the nominal significance level. A favourable overall survival trend in 
the treatment effect was observed across all subgroups examined.  
The results from the secondary endpoints support the benefit observed for the co-primary endpoints of 
rPFS and OS. In particular, opiate use was documented for fewer subjects and the median time to 
initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was significantly longer. For patient related outcome data, a delay 
in median time to average pain intensity progression and a delay in the degradation in the total score 
FACT-P was observed, indicating that quality of life was generally preserved in those subjects treated 
with abiraterone. 
Treatment with abiraterone was tolerable for the majority of subjects and the safety profile was 
generally consistent with previous experience, although exposure to the drug was significantly longer 
than in previous studies. Adverse events were manageable and no major safety concerns have been 
raised for this application and indication. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A single pivotal trial supports this application. There is a general demand for replication of scientific 
results. However, COU-AA-302 is considered adequate to support authorisation, with statistically 
compelling and clinically relevant results.  
Overall survival did not reach the prespecified statistical significance based on an O’Brien-Fleming 
efficacy boundary at the interim analysis. A favourable trend in the treatment effect of abiraterone on 
OS was observed at the third interim analysis of OS, though it is noted that a stable estimate of the 
median survival is not yet available because of the high percentage of censored events. Longer follow-
up is required to obtain this estimate. 
At this point, at minimum an increase in rPFS together with a preservation of patient quality of life has 
been demonstrated. The effect seen in these two parameters in considered of sufficient relevance so as 
to support an indication for abiraterone in this clinical setting.  
It is recognised that disease progression endpoint has not been a reliable predictor of overall survival 
in patients with prostate cancer. Nevertheless, as abiraterone increased OS in the post-docetaxel stage 
of the disease, it is safe to expect that the same treatment could be capable of prolonging survival in 
the pre-chemotherapy setting, also considering the strong trend observed for an improvement of OS.  
The time to deterioration of ECOG PS was statistically significant but the difference between the 
medians was at best moderate. However, this was only a secondary endpoint. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Exposure to abiraterone in COU-AA-302 is considered sufficient for assessment of safety and the 
median treatment duration was approximately twice that seen in study COU-AA-301. Fewer subjects in 
the abiraterone group discontinued and the most common reason for treatment discontinuation was 
disease progression. 
Treatment with abiraterone was tolerable for the majority of subjects and overall the adverse event 
profile was generally consistent with previous experience and manageable. As expected, 
mineralocorticoid related toxicities were observed more frequently in the abiraterone group. Clinically 
meaningful imbalances between studies identified dyspepsia, AST increased, rash and haematuria as

new ADR. There were no unexpected SAEs. No new ADRs have been identified from post marketing 
data. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Potential QT signals were identified in study COU-AA-302. The Applicant continues to conduct ECG 
monitoring as part of the ongoing clinical development programme and has updated the RMP to include 
these studies as additional pharmacovigilance activities. Safety in patients NYHA Class II to IV heart 
failure has not established. Adequate warnings are found in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. More abiraterone 
treated subjects died within 30 days of the last dose of study medication, although the deaths have not 
been attributed to abiraterone toxicity. Overall, the uncertainties regarding the unfavourable effects 
are not considered to have a major impact. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Abiraterone is a well-tolerated anti-cancer therapy. The data derived from study COU-AA-302 are 
considered to demonstrate a clinically relevant benefit to patients who require additional therapeutic 
options. The magnitude of the effect is significant, particularly in terms of the observed delay in 
progression, the delay in the median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy and the reduction in 
the requirement for opiate use. A favourable overall survival trend was observed. 
Treatment with abiraterone was tolerable for the majority of subjects and overall the adverse event 
profile was consistent with previous experience. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The favourable effects are considered to more than exceed the unfavourable effects/uncertainties and 
overall the benefit risk profile is considered to be positive.  
The most influential factors for a positive opinion are the magnitude in the delay of progression and 
the clinically relevant advantage of the delay in time to initiation of chemotherapy and reduced opiate 
use. Furthermore, quality of life was generally preserved in patients treated with abiraterone compared 
to those treated with placebo. In line with previous experience, treatment with abiraterone was 
generally tolerable. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The prognosis of mCRPC patients is still poor (median survival of approximately 1 to 2 year). After 
patients become castration resistant and provided that they remain asymptomatic or have mild 
symptoms, so that chemotherapy is not yet indicated, different hormonal managements can be used; 
however, globally there is neither clear consensus nor clear proof of efficacy in terms of survival of 
available treatments. Such patients who are not in immediate need of chemotherapy may still benefit 
from alternative therapies. The data derived from study COU-AA-302 are considered to demonstrate a 
clinically relevant and significant advantage to this group of patients. 
In conclusion, the overall benefit-risk balance of Zytiga in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 
for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer in adult men who are 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom 
chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated, is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Variations accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.4 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC 
II 
due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or 
pharmacovigilance data 
Extension of Indication to include new population for Zytiga in combination with prednisone or 
prednisolone for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer in adult men who are 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom 
chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated in order to: 
add a new contraindication in patients with severe hepatic impairment, a new posology 
recommendation on concomitant LHRH administration in patients not surgically castrated and new 
warnings related to hyperglycaemia, use with chemotherapy and potential risks of anaemia and sexual 
dysfunction; update posology recommendations and warnings related to heart failure, 
mineralocorticoid toxicities, hepatotoxicity and hepatic impairment; update the existing warning in 
patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, the table of adverse drug reactions and cross 
references from the pharmacokinetic information to the safety sections of the SmPC; include 
information from the pivotal study in the SmPC. 
In  the  second  variation,  recommendations  were  updated  in  section  4.6  of  the  SmPC  and  the  results 
from reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were included in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The  Package  Leaflet  is  updated  in  accordance.  Finally,  minor  changes  were  made  to  the  SmPC, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the SmPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

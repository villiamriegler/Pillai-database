2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is a generic medicinal product of Busilvex which has been authorised in the EU 
since 09 July 2003. 
The active substance of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is busulfan an alkyl sulfonate (L01AB01) and a potent 
cytotoxic agent and a bifunctional alkylating agent. In aqueous media, release of the 
Assessment report

methanesulphonate groups produces carbonium ions which can alkylate DNA, thought to be an 
important biological mechanism for its cytotoxic effect. 
The safety and efficacy profile of busulfan has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of 
which can be found in the EPAR for Busilvex. In addition, there is extensive post-marketing experience 
contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic 
application referring to the reference medicinal product Busilvex, summary of the clinical data of 
busulfan is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
efficacy and safety have been conducted. 
Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is administered intravenously and is 100% bioavailable; therefore, a 
bioequivalence study versus the reference product Busilvex was not required.  
The approved indication is:  
Busulfan followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) is indicated as conditioning treatment prior to 
conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in adult patients when the 
combination is considered the best available option. 
Busulfan followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy4) or melphalan (BuMel) is indicated as conditioning 
treatment prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation in paediatric patients 
The indication proposed for Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is the same as authorized for the reference 
medicinal product. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 6 mg/ml of 
busulfan as active substance.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The purpose of the development study was to develop a generic essentially similar to the reference 
product, Busilvex 6 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. No bioequivalence study was 
performed and the justification given is that the product is to be administered as an intravenous 
solution, containing the same active substance and excipients in the same concentration as the 
reference product. 
The excipients used in the formulation are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those used in the 
reference product. The selected grade of dimethylacetamide complies with the Ph Eur monograph. The 
selected grade of macrogol (polyethylene glycol) is multicompendial. Busulfan Fresenius Kabi must be 
diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% glucose injection. Dilution fluid compatibility studies 
were carried out. Compatibility with both solutions was demonstrated. 
The following characteristics of the reference product were studied in order to establish the target 
profile for the generic product: dosage form, dosage strength, route of administration, container 
closure, storage conditions, shelf life, dilution fluids, and stability after dilution. It was concluded that 
the solubility, assay, impurities, residual solvents and water content are considered as critical quality 
attributes that can be significantly affected by the formulation used and the process design. A risk 
assessment was conducted on these parameters as part of the pharmaceutical development studies. 
Based on the targeted product profile and the risk assessment made, it was concluded that the 
following studies should be carried out: selection of excipients, effect of water content, effect of 
headspace gas, light sensitivity, selection of filter and filter compatibility, compatibility with equipment 
and stainless steel container. Details of the studies performed were provided and found satisfactory. 
The manufacturing process comprises of bulk manufacturing, aseptic filtration and filling. The choice of 
selection of manufacturing temperature,   sterilisation method together with other critical process 
parameters was justified. 
The primary packaging proposed for Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is a clear colourless glass vial (type I) 
with teflon faced rubber stopper and sealed with aluminium flip-off seal. Compatibility with the primary 
packaging material chosen is shown and a photo stability study has been presented. A stopper 
compatibility study has been carried out and it was concluded that both the glass vial and the stopper 
are compatible with the drug product. Container closure integrity testing of the sealed container has 
Assessment report  
EMA/552423/2014 
Page 7/15 
 
  
  
been carried out and the test data sheets. The proposed container closure system is commonly used 
for parenterals. It is in line with the requirements specified in the Ph Eur. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process comprises of bulk manufacturing, aseptic filtration process, aseptic filling, 
stoppering, sealing and washing, optical inspection and washing. 
Sterilizing grade filters are used for filtration and sterilization. Integrity testing is performed pre and 
post filtration by the bubble point test. The filters are discarded after post-filtration integrity testing  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated in three commercial scale batches by a 
number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing 
the finished product of the intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, identification (TLC, 
HPLC), degradation products, extractable volume (Ph Eur), water (Ph Eur), sterility (Ph Eur), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph Eur), impurities (HPLC), particulate contamination (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC), and colour 
absorbance (UV).  
Batch analysis results in three batches of commercial scale confirm consistency and uniformity of 
manufacture and indicate that the process is capable and under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  3  production  batches  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term  conditions  for  18  
months  (1  batch)  and  17  months  (2  batches)    at  5ºC  ±  3ºC  (upright  and  inverted)  and  for  up  to  6 
months under accelerated conditions at 25ºC ±  2ºC / 60% ± 5% RH according to the ICH guidelines 
were  provided.  The  batches  of  Busulfan  Fresenius  Kabi  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  the  following  tests:  appearance,  water  content,  degradation  products, 
impurities, assay, colour absorbance, particulate contamination, sterility, bacterial endotoxins and seal 
integrity. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
Assessment report  
EMA/552423/2014 
Page 8/15 
 
  
  
 
 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Busulfan Fresenius Kabi 6 mg/ml manufactured by Fresenius Kabi is considered unlikely 
to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all busulfan containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar 
and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of busulfan are well known.  No non-
clinical data are submitted with this application. Published literature has been reviewed and is 
considered of suitable quality. 
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), justification for not providing ERA is acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This application concerns a generic version of busulfan concentrate for solution for infusion. The 
reference product Busilvex is indicated as conditioning treatment prior to conventional haematopoietic 
progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in adult patients when the combination is considered the best 
available option followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) and as conditioning treatment prior to 
conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation in paediatric patients followed by 
cyclophosphamide (BuCy4) or melphalan (BuMel). No nonclinical studies have been provided for this 
application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance 
was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application did not contain 
new data either on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics nor on the efficacy and safety of the 
active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from 
published literature was considered sufficient. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Busulfan Fresenius Kabi is not similar to Tepadina within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 1 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus  
that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Busulfan  Fresenius  Kabi  indicated  as  conditioning  treatment  prior  to 
conventional  haematopoietic  progenitor  cell  transplantation  (HPCT)  in  adult  patients  when  the 
combination  is  considered  the  best  available  option  followed  by  cyclophosphamide  (BuCy2)  and  as 
conditioning  treatment  prior  to  conventional  haematopoietic  progenitor  cell  transplantation  in 
paediatric  patients  followed  by  cyclophosphamide  (BuCy4)  or  melphalan  (BuMel)  is  favourable  and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

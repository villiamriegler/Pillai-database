2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Urothelial carcinoma (UC) originates in the urothelial cells (also referred to as transitional cells) that 
line the bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis. The majority (90%) of UCs originate in the urinary bladder, 
while up to 10% originate in the upper urinary tract (ureters and/or renal pelvis) (Hepp et al, 2020; 
Miyazaki & Nishiyama, 2017). Although the majority of patients present with non-invasive disease, 
15% to 25% of UCs either present with or eventually progress to muscle invasive or metastatic 
disease. Once invasive into the muscularis propria, UC of the bladder, commonly referred to as muscle 
invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), is an aggressive disease that requires multimodal treatment, which 
includes radical surgery or radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Survival depends amongst 
others on pathological stage; for patients with pT0 a median OS of 11.3 years is reported, for pT2 a 
median survival of 6.25 years is reported, while for those with pT3/T4 a median OS of 2 years is 
reported (Supit et al, 2014; Mitra et al, 2011; Barton Grossman et al, 2003). 
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022  
Page 9/133 
 
 
 
Despite multimodal treatment, more than 50% of patients with MIBC will eventually develop 
metastases; upon metastatic relapse, the prognosis is dismal, with a median overall survival (OS) up 
to 15 months with chemotherapy alone and to up to 21 months when maintenance checkpoint inhibitor 
is added for patients without disease progression after completing of first line therapy (Von der Maase 
H et al,2005). 
Muscle invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is less common. From literature it is not 
entirely clear whether UTUC is the same or a different disease entity as MIBC. However, as it concerns 
a different anatomic site and lymphogenic spreading pattern, the course of disease and metastasis 
pattern might differ. Similar to MIBC, muscle invasive UTUC is an aggressive disease that requires 
radical surgery with a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 30 months. Cisplatin-based adjuvant 
chemotherapy has a role in muscle invasive UTUC based on the results of the POUT (Peri-Operative 
chemotherapy versus surveillance in UTUC) study (Birtle A,2020). 
The proposed indication is: 
“OPDIVO® as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with muscle invasive 
urothelial carcinoma (MIUC) who are at high risk of recurrence after undergoing radical resection of 
MIUC (see section 5.1).” 
Epidemiology  
UC of the bladder is among the 10 most common cancers in the world with the highest incidence rates 
observed in men in Europe (Age-Standardized incidence Rates (ASR) per 100.000 in Southern Europe 
is 26.5, in Western Europe-ASR is 22.5) and North America (ASR is 19.7). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Environmental exposures account for most cases of bladder cancer. The surface epithelium 
(urothelium) that lines the mucosal surfaces of the entire urinary tract is exposed to potential 
carcinogens that are either excreted in the urine or activated from precursors in the urine by 
hydrolyzing enzymes. This "field cancerization" effect is one hypothesis to explain the multifocal 
occurrence that is a characteristic feature of urothelial carcinomas of both the urinary bladder and the 
upper urinary tract. (Burger M. et al, 2013). 
However, in the majority of cases, multifocal urothelial carcinomas are monoclonal. This supports their 
presumed origin from a single genetically altered cell, which then spreads through the urothelium via 
intraluminal seeding or intraepithelial migration (monoclonality hypothesis). Although the 
monoclonality hypothesis appears to conflict with field cancerization, both mechanisms are probably 
operative in urothelial carcinogenesis, as has been shown with squamous carcinogenesis in the oral 
cavity. 
Chemical carcinogenesis is believed to be responsible for much of the burden of bladder cancer, 
including the increased risk associated with cigarette smoke as well as various industrial exposures. 
The relationship of bladder cancer to chemical carcinogens was initially suggested by the high 
incidence of bladder cancer in workers with particular chemical exposures. (Freedman ND et al, 2011) 
Subsequent epidemiologic and laboratory studies have identified a large number of chemical 
compounds thought to be carcinogenic (EAU Guideline muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer, 
2020).

Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The most common symptom of bladder cancer is painless haematuria, seen in >80% of patients. 
Others may also present with irritative symptoms such as dysuria, frequency or urgency. 
Pathological diagnosis should be made according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classiﬁcation 
from a biopsy obtained during transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT). Tumours should 
be graded as high and low grade according to the latest WHO criteria (2004). MIBC should be staged 
according to the tumour–node–metastasis (TNM) system. 
Complete TURBT is the treatment of choice for any initial bladder tumour, followed by instillations 
according to risk stratiﬁcation in NMIBC. In MIBC treatment is far more extensive (see management). 
Management 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
Patients with MIBC, defined as stage T2-T4a, N0, and M0, are at a high risk for developing metastatic 
disease, even after undergoing radical cystectomy (RC), which represents the standard of care 
treatment. The administration of neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy has consistently 
demonstrated a survival benefit when given prior to surgery. This was demonstrated in a 2003 meta-
analysis of 11 randomised trials that compared cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus local 
therapy with local therapy alone (Stadler, 2003). Compared with local therapy alone, neoadjuvant 
cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy resulted in an improvement in overall survival (five-year 
overall survival 50 versus 45 percent, hazard ratio (HR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.98) and a lower risk of 
recurrence (HR for recurrence 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.90). This translated into an absolute disease-free 
survival (DFS) benefit of 7 percent. 
The OS outcome is affected by the pathologic response to the neoadjuvant therapy. For patients that 
had a residual disease < ypT2N0, the 5-year OS rate is 75%-80%. For patients with post RC stage ≥ 
ypT2N0, the 5-year OS rate is 20%-45%. The 5-year OS rate for patients who did not receive 
neoadjuvant cisplatin with high-risk residual disease of pT3–pT4 pN0 or any pT pN+ at RC is reported 
at 37%-50% (median OS not reported).  
For patients with UTUC no randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have been published yet but prospective 
data from a phase II trial showed that the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a 
14% pathological complete response rate for high grade UTUC.  
Adjuvant chemotherapy 
While there is still insufﬁcient evidence for the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy in clinical practice 
for MIBC and UTUC, it is likely that high-risk patients, such as those with extravesical and/or node-
positive disease that have not received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, will beneﬁt most from adjuvant 
chemotherapy (ESMO guideline).  
Radical cystectomy (RC) without any neoadjuvant therapy represents the primary treatment choice for 
patients unfit to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy (up to 65% of patients) due to poor renal 
function, advanced age, hearing loss, peripheral neuropathy, or poor performance status and/or New 
York Heart Association class III heart failure. 
Some data indicate that there may be improved outcomes with the addition of adjuvant platinum-
based chemotherapy in UTUC. 
The POUT trial, an open-label phase III trial that enrolled 261 UTUC patients with either muscle 
invasive (ie, pT2-4, N any stage) or node positive disease (i.e., T any stage, N1-3) who had undergone 
nephroureterectomy (Birtle 2020) showed that adjuvant chemotherapy improved DFS compared with 
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022  
Page 11/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
surveillance (at three-year DFS was 71% versus 46 respectively % with an hazard ratio (HR) 0.45, 
95% CI 0.30-0.68).  
The most extensive data on OS for such approach comes from an observational study (SanjayTanday 
2017) from the National Cancer Database of 3253 patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy 
between 2004 and 2012 for high-risk urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract. All patients had a 
T3-T4 primary tumour and/or node positive disease. In this analysis, 762 patients underwent adjuvant 
chemotherapy, and 2491 were managed with observation. Although selection bias is likely, OS at a 
median follow-up of 50 months was longer with adjuvant chemotherapy compared with observation 
(median of 47 versus 36 months, five-year survival rate was 44% versus 36%, HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-
0.88). 
The main limitation of using adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced UTUC remains the limited ability to 
deliver the full dose cisplatin-based regimen after radical nefro-ureterectomy (RNU), given that this 
surgical procedure is likely to impact renal function. 
Inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade have been approved for the treatment of metastatic 
UC.  Nivolumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) has been approved in patients with locally advanced unresectable or 
metastatic UC in patients after failure of prior platinum-containing therapy. Pembrolizumab (another 
PD-1 inhibitor) has been approved for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic UC in patients 
who have received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy and in patients who are not eligible for 
cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive score 
(CPS) ≥ 10. Atezolizumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) has been approved for the treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic UC after platinum-containing chemotherapy or in patients who are 
considered cisplatin eligible and whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%. Avelumab (a PD-L1 
inhibitor) has been approved for first-line maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic UC who are progression-free following platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Currently, no agent is approved in the adjuvant treatment for MIUC. 
An unmet need exists in patients who have high risk residual disease following RC, regardless of 
whether they received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, especially if they are not eligible for cisplatin-
based adjuvant chemotherapy. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which binds to the 
programmed death 1 (PD 1) receptor and blocks its interaction with PD L1 and PD L2. The PD 1 
receptor is a negative regulator of T cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T 
cell immune responses. Engagement of PD 1 with the ligands PD L1 and PD L2, which are expressed in 
antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment, results in inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab 
potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD 1 binding to PD 
L1 and PD L2 ligands. In syngeneic mouse models, blocking PD 1 activity resulted in decreased tumour 
growth. Nivolumab as monotherapy or combined with other therapeutics is approved for the following 
indications: (adjuvant or metastatic) melanoma, (metastatic) NSCLC, advanced RCC, classical HL, 
(recurrent or metastatic) SCCHN, (advanced or metastatic) urothelial cancer, (advanced, recurrent or 
metastatic) squamous oesophageal cancer.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The ongoing clinical development program includes numerous studies evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of nivolumab as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics across multiple 
tumour types and lines of therapy. 
The current application for adjuvant MIUC is based on data from a pivotal Phase 3 study (CA209274), 
with a 27-Aug-2020 database lock (DBL).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nivolumab clinical pharmacology profile, including single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, 
drug-drug interaction potential, QT prolongation potential, and dose selection for phase 2/3 studies 
was well characterized and described in the initial marketing authorization dossier. 
Nivolumab pharmacokinetics from study CA209274 were analysed and compared with historical 
pharmacokinetic monotherapy data including PK data in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0019). PopPK analyses were performed for nivolumab

adding data from the CA209274 study into the existing popPK models. Exposure-response analyses 
were conducted to provide a model based bridge from nivolumab 240 mg Q2W (dosing regimen 
evaluated in study CA209274) to 480 mg Q4W. Nivolumab immunogenicity data are also presented 
from study CA209274. 
Bioanalytical methods 
The pharmacokinetic samples from subjects in study CA209274 were analysed by cross-validated 
electrochemiluminescence assays ICD 416 (previously used) and by 14BASM122. The bioanalytical 
methods for the assessment of (neutralizing) antibodies against nivolumab were also the same as 
presented in the previously submitted marketing application for nivolumab. 
Population pharmacokinetics 
A nivolumab popPK model has been previously developed with data from multiple tumour types, 
including advanced or metastatic UC (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0019). The main purpose of the updated 
popPK analysis was to characterize the PK of nivolumab in subjects with muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma in the adjuvant setting in CA209274 who received nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and to determine 
the effects of covariates on nivolumab PK. Moreover, the purpose was to compare summary measures 
of nivolumab exposure in nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), 
posology which is proposed in adjuvant treatment of subjects with muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma.  
In study CA209274 nivolumab pharmacokinetic samples were collected at pre-dose C1, C2, C3, C7 and 
every 6 cycles after C7 until discontinuation of study treatment and on first 2 follow-up visits, FU1 and 
2.  
The population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis dataset included a total of 5,282 nivolumab 
concentration values from 1,181 subjects from 7 studies in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma, and advanced UC. These studies included 2 
Phase 1 studies (CA209001 and CA209003 (multiple tumour types, only NSCLC included)), 1 Phase 1/2 
study (CA209032 (multiple tumour types, only advanced UC included)), 1 Phase 2 study (CA209275 
(advanced UC)), and 3 Phase 3 studies (CA209017 (NSCLC), CA029057 (NSCLC), and CA209274 
(adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma), (N=333)). 
Two different full models exploring time-varying versus stationary CL of nivolumab in adjuvant MIUC 
were evaluated. Nivolumab pharmacokinetics for adjuvant treatment of muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma was best described by a time-varying clearance.  
Model development consisted of re-estimating parameters of the previously developed final model 
(Zhang et al 2019, see also Procedure EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0019) excluding the effect of combination 
regimen with ipilimumab and tumour type.  
The model was a 2-compartment, zero-order infusion model with time-varying total CL described using 
a sigmoidal Emax function with a proportional residual error model, random effect on CL, 
intercompartmental clearance (Q), VC, volume of distribution of peripheral compartment (VP), and 
EMAX and correlation of random effect between CL and VC. The full model was developed from the 
base model by incorporating additional covariates to assess the impact of tumour type (adjuvant 
muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma, advanced UC versus NSCLC) on nivolumab CL. The following 
covariates were already included in the base model: for CL body weight, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR), baseline albumin, performance status, sex, race, covariates for the volume of distribution 
of the VC were body weight and sex, and covariate for Emax was baseline performance status. 
Covariate relationships between BBWT and intercompartmental clearance (Q), and BBWT and volume 
of the peripheral compartment (VP) were assumed identical to the relationships between BBWT and 
CL, and BBWT and VC, respectively.

The full model with lower Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) value was chosen for model evaluation, 
bootstrap, and model application. 
Model evaluation was performed for the full model using prediction-corrected visual predictive checks 
(pcVPC), which provided a graphical assessment of the agreement between the time-course of 
observed and model-predicted concentrations. In addition, a bootstrap procedure was performed to 
assess the accuracy of the final parameter estimates in the full model. 
Model application for adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma and advanced UC consisted of 
obtaining summary measures of exposures at the nivolumab dose regimens 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg 
Q4W for each subject in the analysis dataset for whom empirical Bayesian estimates (EBE) of the PK 
parameters were available. The exposures were summarized by tumour type (adjuvant muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinoma versus advanced UC) for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W dosing regimen, in 
adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma subjects by nivolumab dosing regimens of 240 mg Q2W 
versus 480 mg Q4W. 
Table 1 presents the structural model parameter estimates from the full model (Full Model 1). The 
expressions describing the functional form of the time-varying CL and covariate effects are given below 
the table.

Figure 1 shows that the effects of adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma and advanced UC on 
CL were small, corresponding to an approximate 14% and 8% lower CL, respectively, relative to a 
typical subject with greater than 2L+ NSCLC. The maximal reductions in CL for adjuvant muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinoma and advanced UC are similar (not statistically significant) relative to the 
maximal reduction in CL for 2L+ NSCLC, percent changes in CLss/CL0 of 1% and 7% (less reduction), 
respectively. Based on the estimated time to achieve 50% of the maximum response (T50) of 1,380 
hours, the half-maximal change in CL is estimated to occur at approximately 58 days. The estimated 
effect of eGFR, race (Asian), Performance Status (PS), body weight, albumin, and sex on nivolumab CL 
were consistent with the previous analyses; the magnitudes of the effects on the parameters (CL and 
VC) were less than 20% for all other covariates except body weight and albumin.

A comparison of nivolumab exposures for 240 mg Q2W versus 480 mg Q4W is presented in Table 3. 
For the adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma population, the geometric means of nivolumab 
exposure in the population were higher with 480 mg Q4W dosing relative to 240 mg Q2W dosing for 5 
of the 8 summary measures of exposure; namely, Cavg1, Cavgd28, Cmax1, Cmaxss, and Cmin1, 
whereas the geometric mean exposures matched well between the dosing regimens for Cavgss 
(difference of 0.885%), and were lower for Cmind28 (23.3%) and Cminss (17.5%). Cmax1 
concentrations were twice as high for the 480 mg Q4W dose regimen compared with 240 mg Q2W, the 
difference in peak nivolumab concentrations was approximately 31% at steady state.

Immunogenicity - effect on nivolumab pharmacokinetics 
In Study CA209274, serum samples were collected at regular intervals (based on 5 half-lives of 
nivolumab) for immunogenicity assessment. Of the 305 subjects with evaluable nivolumab Anti Drug 
Antibody (ADA) in the nivolumab arm, 13 (4.3%) subjects were nivolumab ADA-positive at baseline 
and 42 (13.8%) subjects were nivolumab ADA-positive after the start of treatment (Table 4). For the 
subjects positive at baseline the titer post-treatment had to increase by 4-fold after start of treatment 
in order to be categorized as ADA-positive. No subjects were considered persistent positive (ADA-
positive sample at 2 or more consecutive time points), and 5 (1.6%) subjects have neutralizing ADA-
positive. The highest titer value observed in nivolumab ADA-positive subjects was 128, which occurred 
in 1 subject. All other titers were low, ranging from 0 to 32.

In the popPK analysis, based on the time-varying nature of the ADA data, immunogenicity status was 
defined as positive when at least one positive ADA result was reported (N=52), negative when none of 
the samples was positive for ADAs (N=279). Two subjects had no immunogenicity data. Baseline 
nivolumab clearance in ADA negative subjects was 8.5 mL/h vs. 9.7 mL/h in ADA positive subjects. At 
steady-state, estimated nivolumab clearance in ADA negative subjects was 6.1 mL/h vs. 7.1 mL/h in 
ADA positive subjects. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
PD-1 is a type I transmembrane protein primarily expressed on activated T-cells, B-cells, myeloid cells, 
and antigen-presenting cells. Binding of PD-1 to programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 
programmed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) has been shown to down-regulate T-cell activation in both 
murine and human systems. Opdivo binds to PD-1 and exhibits its antineoplastic function by 
upregulating T-cell activation. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
PD-1 is a type I transmembrane protein primarily expressed on activated T-cells, B-cells, myeloid cells, 
and antigen-presenting cells. Binding of PD-1 to programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 
programmed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) has been shown to down-regulate T-cell activation in both 
murine and human systems. Opdivo binds to PD-1 and exhibits its antineoplastic function by 
upregulating T-cell activation. 
No new clinical pharmacology studies were conducted for this application but exposure-response 
analyses were conducted to provide a model based bridge from nivolumab 240 mg Q2W (dosing 
regimen evaluated in study CA209274) to 480 mg Q4W. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
The objectives of nivolumab exposure-response (E-R) analysis for the adjuvant treatment of muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinoma were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To characterize the relationship between nivolumab exposure (trough concentration at Day 28 
(Cmind28)) and efficacy (disease-free survival (DFS)) in subjects with adjuvant muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinoma (adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma). 
To compare predicted efficacy (Disease Free Survival (DFS)) of nivolumab 240 mg every 2 
weeks (Q2W) and nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) to that of the placebo comparator 
arm. 
To characterize the relationship between nivolumab exposure (post dose 1 peak serum 
concentration (Cmax1)) and safety (Grade 2+ immune-mediated adverse events (Gr2+ 
IMAEs)) in subjects with adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. 
To compare predicted safety (Gr2+ IMAEs) of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and nivolumab 480 mg 
Q4W.

The exposure-response efficacy (DFS) analysis included data from adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma subjects who received nivolumab (N=333) or placebo (N=356) in Study CA209274 and had 
evaluable PK data. The exposure-response efficacy (DFS) dataset sensoring of the data was 43% for 
placebo and 52.3% for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W. 
Summary statistics of the baseline covariates by treatment and prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin are 
presented in Table 5. A small fraction of subjects was missing covariate information. Continuous 
covariate values for Baseline Albumin (BALB) were missing for 2.5% of subjects and were imputed at 
the median value. Categorical covariate values for baseline PS, PD-L1 expression, and pathological 
status were missing for 0.1%, 1.5%, and 1.7% of subjects, respectively, and were imputed at the 
mode.

The exposure-response safety (Gr2+ IMAEs) analysis included data (N=1171) from adjuvant muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinoma subjects who received nivolumab (N=333) in the Study CA209274 and 5 
additional studies to characterize exposure-response safety in subjects with adjuvant muscle invasive 
urothelial carcinoma, advanced urothelial carcinoma (advanced UC), and non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) across a broad dose range from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg Q2W. The additional studies included a 
Phase 1 study (CA209003 (only NSCLC included)), 1 Phase 1/2 study (CA209032 (multiple tumour 
types, only advanced UC included)), 1 Phase 2 study (CA209275 (advanced UC)), and 3 Phase 3 
studies (CA209017 (NSCLC), CA029057 (NSCLC), and CA209274 (adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma)). 
The analysis dataset was split into a model development cohort and model validation cohort. The 
summaries of data are presented by the development and validation cohorts. 
METHODS: 
Exposure-response Analysis of Efficacy for DFS: The exposure-response relationship between time to 
DFS and nivolumab exposure (Cmind28) was described by a semi-parametric Cox Proportional Hazards 
(CPH) model and included assessments of the modulatory effect of covariates on this exposure-
response relationship. The effect of nivolumab exposure on DFS was calculated relative to the placebo 
arm. Sensitivity analyses were conducted without the placebo control arm.  
The full model characterized the effect of nivolumab exposure on DFS, while taking into account 
prespecified covariates. Nivolumab Cmind28 was tested as linear and log-linear functions in the full 
model. Baseline covariates tested for exposure-response relationship of DFS included: baseline 
albumin, age, performance status (PS), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) status, prior neo-adjuvant 
cisplatin, sex, pathological status, and nodal status. In addition, interaction between nivolumab 
Cmind28 and each statistically significant covariate effect in the full model was tested univariately after 
the functional form of exposure was determined in the full model. 
The final model was developed by performing a stepwise backward elimination of the full model to 
determine a parsimonious model based upon Bayesian information criteria (BIC). The model 
performance was assessed by visual predictive check (VPC). The CPH model predictions were 
evaluated by comparing the model-predicted cumulative time-to-event distributions of DFS with the 
corresponding distribution determined by non-parametric KM analysis. Data used in the model 
development were used as an internal validation dataset for KM analysis. For external validation, the 
exposure-response analysis of DFS was performed by 5-fold cross-validation, whereby model 
prediction was compared with data from subjects who were not included in the estimation of the 
model. 
The final exposure-response model was used to predict the DFS probability at 1 and 2 years and the 
hazard ratio (HR) by prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment for adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma comparing nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and nivolumab 480 mg Q4W to the placebo treatment 
arm in subjects in Study CA209274. 
Exposure-response Analysis of Safety for Grade 2+ IMAEs: The exposure-response relationship 
between nivolumab exposure (Cmax1) and time to first occurrence of Gr2+ IMAEs was described by a 
semi-parametric CPH model and included assessments of the modulatory effect of covariates on this 
exposure-response relationship. 
The full model characterized the effect of nivolumab exposure on Gr2+ IMAEs, while taking into 
account prespecified covariates. Nivolumab Cmax1 was tested as linear and log-linear functions in the 
full model. Baseline covariates tested for exposure-response relationships of Gr2+ IMAEs included: 
body weight, age, sex, PS, and tumour type. In addition, interaction between nivolumab Cmax1 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022  
Page 25/133 
 
 
 
each statistically significant covariate effect in the full model was tested univariately after the 
functional form of exposure was determined in the full model. 
The final safety model was developed by performing a stepwise backward elimination of the full model 
to determine a parsimonious model based upon BIC and was used for model evaluation and model 
application. 
The final exposure-response safety model was used to predict the Gr2+ IMAE rate for nivolumab 240 
mg Q2W and nivolumab 480 mg Q4W at 6 months and 1 year for adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma subjects (Study CA209274) and advanced UC subjects (Studies CA209032 and CA209275). 
RESULTS: 
Exposure-response Analysis of Efficacy for DFS 
In the full model assessment, the relationship of nivolumab Cmind28 with DFS was dependent on 
whether adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma subjects received prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin 
treatment or not (Figure 2). In subjects who received prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin, higher nivolumab 
Cmind28 exposures were associated with significantly (95% CI interval excluded 1) lower risk of 
disease recurrence or death than the placebo (HR: 0.59 and 0.3 at the 5th and 95th percentile of 
Cmind28, respectively in reference to placebo). In subjects who did not receive prior neo-adjuvant 
cisplatin, nivolumab Cmind28 exposures were not significantly associated with risk of disease 
recurrence or death. Sensitivity analyses excluding placebo or excluding interaction between nivolumab 
Cmind28 and neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment were also provided in Figure 2. 
Prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment, nodal status, pathological status, sex, and baseline albumin 
(BALB) were also identified as significant predictors of DFS in the full model. The interaction effects 
between nivolumab Cmind28 and significant covariates were tested and only prior neo-adjuvant 
cisplatin decreased the BIC and therefore was selected for inclusion in the full model.

Sensitivity analyses excluding placebo or excluding interaction between nivolumab Cmind28 and neo-
adjuvant cisplatin treatment were also provided in Figure 3. In comparison to the model with placebo 
(Figure 2), the level of significance of certain covariates changed in the model with nivolumab treated 
subjects only e.g. for PD-L1 expression and neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment, however, the direction of 
effects of exposure and covariates on the risk of DFS events were similar to that of the full model.

Additional validation of the exposure-response model of DFS was performed by 5-fold cross-validation, 
whereby model predictions of DFS were compared with data from subjects who were not included in 
the estimation of the model. Overall, the average bias in the original model (bias overall at 1 year and 
2 years was -0.02532 and -0.06158, respectively) was similar to the average bias in the cross-
validation models (bias validation at 1 year and 2 years was -0.02665 and -0.06289, respectively). 
Exposure-response Analysis of Safety for Grade 2+ IMAEs 
In the full model assessment, higher nivolumab Cmax1 was significantly (95% CI for the HR excluded 
1) associated with higher risk (HR: 1.35 from median 60 μg/mL to 95th percentile 145 μg/mL) of Gr2+ 
IMAEs. Figure 5 presents the estimated effects of exposure and covariates on the HR of Gr2+ IMAEs 
in the full model. Baseline body weight, age, sex, and tumour type were identified as significant 
predictors of Gr2+ IMAEs in the full model. The interaction between nivolumab Cmax1 and each

significant covariate was examined and none of the interactions were identified as significant predictors 
of Gr2+ IMAEs in the full model.

IMAEs were similar to that of the full model.

Table 6 Summary of exposure measures in exposure-response efficacy analysis dataset, by dosing 
regimen and neo-adjuvant cisplatin (study CA209274 and modelling)  
For subjects with prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment, the median predicted HRs and associated 
90% prediction intervals (PIs) for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and nivolumab 480 mg Q4W were both 
below 1, indicating a DFS benefit in these arms compared to the reference placebo group with prior 
neo-adjuvant cisplatin. While the point estimate of the HR for 480 mg Q4W was slightly higher than 
the point estimate for 240 mg Q2W, HR=0.59 (0.50-0.70) and HR=0.50 (0.42-0.60), respectively, it 
overlapped with the 90% PI of the HR for 240 mg Q2W. 
For subjects with no prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment, the median predicted HRs for nivolumab 
240 mg Q2W and nivolumab 480 mg Q4W were nearly identical, consistent with the lack of an 
exposure dependence on DFS in this population. The HRs were both below 1, suggesting a DFS benefit 
over placebo, however, the 90% PIs of the 5th and 95th percentiles of both treatment groups include 
1: predicted HR 240 mg Q2W: 0.92 (0.80-1.07) and HR 480 mg Q4W 0.95 (0.82-1.09). 
For subjects who received prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment, the model-predicted cumulative 
probability of DFS for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and nivolumab 480 mg Q4W was superior to the 
observed DFS in the placebo comparator arm (Figure 6a and Figure 6b). For subjects who did not 
receive prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment, there was considerable overlap between the 90% PIs 
for both nivolumab treatments and placebo.

Using the full DFS model including placebo, the predicted median (90% PI) DFS probability for subjects 
who received prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment was approximately 5% lower for the nivolumab 
480 mg Q4W compared to 240 mg Q2W dosing regimen at 1 year. The median estimates for the 480 
mg Q4W fell within the 90% PI for the 240 mg Q2W nivolumab dosing regimen (Table 7). At 2 years, 
the probability of DFS was 5% lower for the nivolumab 480 mg Q4W compared to 240 mg Q2W dosing 
regimen and the point estimates for 480 mg Q4W fell within the 90% PI for 240 mg Q2W. The DFS 
probability with prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin was greater with both the nivolumab dosing regimens at 
both 1 and 2 years compared to the placebo comparator arm in Study CA209274. Predicted median 
DFS probabilities were similar between 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W at 1 and 2 years (i.e. 1% and 
1% difference between the regimens, respectively) with no prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment 
(Table 7).  
The median (90% PI) probabilities of DFS for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W predicted 
using the full model with nivolumab treated subjects only (Table 7) were similar to those predicted 
using the final model with placebo arm included: the predicted median (90% PI) DFS probability for

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology of nivolumab for the applied indication has been supported by pharmacokinetic and 
exposure-response data. A model based bridge from nivolumab 240 mg Q2W (dosing regimen 
evaluated in study CA209274) to 480 mg Q4W has been provided. Nivolumab immunogenicity data 
have also been presented.  
Nivolumab pharmacokinetics were analysed by adding data from the CA209274 study into the existing 
popPK models. Pharmacokinetics of nivolumab for adjuvant treatment of muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma was best described by a time-varying clearance. Nivolumab exposures were 16%-35% 
higher in adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma compared with subjects with locally advanced 
or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0019).   
A modelling approach was used for the alternative dose of 480 mg Q4W while the study was conducted 
with 240 mg Q2W. In principle, modelling can be used to accept another dosing regimen than has been 
used in the clinical study provided that there is sufficient knowledge on the exposure-response 
relationship in the target population. Only one dose 240 mg Q2W was evaluated for adjuvant muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinoma, which questions the robustness of the exposure-response relationship, in 
particular considering the confounding effect that patient disease/health status may have on the 
clearance of nivolumab (Bajaj 2017, Turner 2018). Indeed, as the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab for 
the adjuvant treatment of subjects who have undergone radical resection of muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma could be best described by a time-varying clearance, this indicates that the confounding 
effect is likely present in this population. PopPK simulations predict that nivolumab exposures will be 
lower for Cmind28 (23.3%) and Cminss (17.5%). Cmax1 concentrations will be twice as high for the 
480 mg Q4W dose regimen compared with 240 mg Q2W, while the difference in peak nivolumab 
concentrations was approximately 31% at steady state. This is similar to what was predicted for other 
populations comparing 480 mg Q4W vs 240 mg Q2W dosing. The potential confounding effect of 
patient disease on clearance of nivolumab cannot be evaluated because of the high correlation 
between clearance and Cmin concentrations when only 1 dose has been used and only trough levels 
have been used to estimate nivolumab exposures.  
The reporting and model evaluation of the exposure-effect modelling was well described and in 
agreement with EMA guidelines (CHMP/EWP/185990/06). The exposure-effect modelling describes the 
central tendency adequately (Figure 4). An interaction between nivolumab exposure (Cmind28) and 
prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin was included in the model as this reduced the variability of the model. The 
mechanistic rationale for such interaction is not clear and would imply that there would be a different 
nivolumab exposure-response for subjects who have received neo-adjuvant cisplatin treatment or not. 
It is therefore debatable that the exposure-response relationship in the muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma population is well understood. In fact, having a sufficiently large range of exposures 
(covering the exposures of 480 Q4W) with their associated efficacy and safety data would be needed. 
In an attempt to use more data, placebo was included in the exposure-response model assuming that 
the exposure-response relationship was similar over the concentration range 0-lowest Cmin28 for 240 
mg Q2W (concentration range not studied) compared to the exposure-response relationship over the 
lowest to highest Cmin28 nivolumab concentration range observed for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W. As a 
higher dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W did not improve the ORR and OS in any population tested, the 240 mg 
Q2W dose is supposedly near or at the flat part of the dose response curve, which does not support 
such an assumption. Further, by introducing placebo in the model, the weight of placebo to the 
exposure-response relationship is high for two reasons: i) half of the data then used consists of 
subjects with placebo have nivolumab = 0 imputed and ii) 0 is an outlier compared the range of 
nivolumab exposures on 240 mg Q2W, and outliers can substantially affect regression coefficients.

Because of these issues, an exposure-response without placebo included is preferred and these data 
were provided as sensitivity analyses.  
In all exposure-response analyses for DFS, higher nivolumab Cmind28 exposures were associated with 
a lower risk of disease recurrence or death. Dosing of 480 mg Q4W to 240 mg Q2W will result in 
average lower Cmind28 exposures. Hence, the exposure-response model predicted a higher point 
estimate of the HR for 480 mg Q4W than the point estimate for 240 mg Q2W and a higher risk of 
disease recurrence or death for the 480 mg Q4W compared to the 240 mg Q2W: at 1 year the 
predicted median (90% PI) DFS probability for subjects who received prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin 
treatment was approximately 9% lower for the nivolumab 480 mg Q4W compared to 240 mg Q2W 
dosing regimen i.e. 0.56 (0.50, 0.63) vs 0.65 (0.59, 0.72). For subjects without neo-adjuvant 
treatment, the predicted median (90% PI) DFS probability was approximately 4% lower for the 
nivolumab 480 mg Q4W compared to 240 mg Q2W dosing regimen i.e. 0.59 (0.54, 0.65) vs 0.63 
(0.57, 0.68). Also a lower plateau was predicted for 480 mg Q4W compared to 240 mg Q2W. 
Considering the exposure-safety analysis, an increased probability of Grade 2+ IMAEs for 480 mg Q4W 
compared to 240 mg Q2W was predicted (Table 8): predicted 6 month and 1 year probabilities of 
Gr2+ IMAE for the nivolumab 480 mg Q4W were approximately 6% and 8% at 6 months and 1 year, 
respectively, higher compared to nivolumab 240 mg Q2W. A similar increase in Grade 2+ IMAEs for 
480 mg Q4W compared to 240 mg Q2W has been observed for other indications and was found 
acceptable for melanoma and RCC indications.  
Overall, based on the modelling, it cannot be concluded that the benefit/risk is the same for the 480 
mg Q4W and the 240 mg Q2W dosing regimen, and it is considered that the reduction of the burden 
for the patient with a less frequent dosing regimen does not outweigh the uncertainties concerning the 
efficacy and safety of the 480 mg Q4W dosing regimen. To ensure minimal loss of efficacy with the 480 
mg qw4 dosing regimen, the MAH compared the 5th percentiles of the simulated Cmin, given either 
dosing (q2w and q4w) regimen. Similar or higher exposures Cmin and Cave (steady-state) of 
nivolumab are expected in subjects with adjuvant treatment of MIUC with 480 mg Q4W compared to 
subjects with advanced UC treated with 240 mg Q2W, which is approved in the EU. Since the site of 
action is the same for the adjuvant treatment of MIUC as for treatment of advanced UC, these 
comparable nivolumab exposure data from advanced UC are considered supportive for efficacy for the 
480 mg Q4W dosing regimen for the adjuvant treatment of MIUC. 
For what concern immunogenicity, 42 (13.8%) subjects were nivolumab ADA-positive after the start of 
treatment and 5 (1.6%) subjects were neutralizing ADA-positive. This is similar to immunogenicity 
data for nivolumab monotherapy across different indications with an 11% ADA response and 0.7% 
neutralizing activity. Nivolumab clearance was approximately 15% higher in subjects with ADAs. This is 
also similar to previous observations. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics and exposure response relationships of nivolumab have been sufficiently investigated 
to support the 240 mg Q2W dosing for the adjuvant treatment of subjects who have undergone radical 
resection of muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma.  
The additional 480 mg Q4W regimen for the adjuvant treatment of subjects who have undergone 
radical resection of muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma, is considered acceptable.

This study consists of 3 phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up. After screening, eligible subjects 
were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the nivolumab or placebo treatment arm and stratified by pathologic 
nodal status (N+ vs. N0/x with < 10 nodes removed vs N0 with ≥ 10 nodes removed), tumour cell PD-
L1 expression (≥ 1%, < 1%, indeterminate), and use of cisplatin neo adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs 
no). In order to be randomised, a subject must have had a tumour cell PD L1 expression level 
classification (≥ 1%, < 1%, indeterminate) as determined by the central laboratory. 
Study participants 
The study population included adult male or female subjects who have undergone radical resection of 
MIUC originating in the bladder or upper urinary tract (renal pelvis or ureter) and are at high risk of 
recurrence. The number of subjects enrolled with upper tract urothelial carcinoma was capped at 20% 
due to the lower natural prevalence.  
Key Inclusion Criteria: 
1. All subjects were required to be in post radical surgical resection (R0) for MIBC performed within 90 
days prior to randomization. 
2. All subjects must have pathologic evidence of urothelial carcinoma (originating in bladder, ureter, or 
renal pelvis) at high risk of recurrence as described in one of the two below scenarios (i or ii): 
i) Subjects who have not received neo-adjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy: any pT3-pT4a or 
pT0/x-pT4a/N+ and were not eligible for or refusing adjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy 
(1) Subjects ineligible for cisplatin due to any of the following criteria: 
a. Creatinine Clearance (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula): < 60 mL/min

chemotherapy, despite being informed by the investigator about the treatment options. 
The subject’s refusal must have been thoroughly documented.  
ii) Subjects who received cisplatin based neo-adjuvant chemotherapy: any pT2-pT4a or pT0/x-
pT4a/N+ 
3. Dominant component of histology needed to be urothelial carcinoma or transitional cell carcinoma. 
Foci of varied histologies (e.g. minor variants) were accepted. 
4. All subjects must have had disease-free status (N0M0) defined as no clinical or radiographic 
evidence of disease documented by a complete physical examination and imaging studies within 4 
weeks prior to randomization. Imaging studies must include CT of chest and CT or MRI of abdomen 
and pelvis including primaries who still have bladder intact. Brain imaging (MRI except where 
contraindicated in which CT scan is acceptable) must be completed within 4 weeks prior to 
randomization for subjects with clinical suspicion of CNS disease at screening. 
5. Tumour tissue from the most recently resected site of disease (preferable) or from the transurethral 
resection that yielded the initial muscle invasive diagnosis must be provided for biomarker analyses. In 
order to be randomised, a subject must have a PD-L1 expression level classification (≥ 1%, < 1%, 
indeterminate) as determined by the central lab. If insufficient tumour tissue content is provided for 
analysis (e.g. unevaluable), acquisition of additional archived tumour tissue from the most recent 
resection (preferable) or from the transurethral resection that yielded the initial muscle invasive 
diagnosis is required. 
6. Life expectancy > 6 months 
7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1. Per inclusion 2 i) (1), 
ECOG PS 2 is listed as part of cisplatin ineligibility criteria. Subjects that have not received cisplatin 
based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are considered ineligible for cisplatin adjuvant chemotherapy, 
may enter the study with ECOG PS 2.  
8. Prior surgery that required general anaesthesia must be completed at least 4 weeks before study 
drug administration. Surgery requiring local/epidural anaesthesia must be completed at least 72 hours 
before study drug administration. 
Key Exclusion Criteria: 
1. Partial cystectomy in the setting of bladder cancer primary tumour or partial nephrectomy in the 
setting of renal pelvis primary tumour. 
2. Adjuvant systemic or radiation therapy for urothelial or prostatic carcinoma following radical surgical 
resection of urothelial carcinoma. 
3. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may have

diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone 
replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the 
absence of an external trigger are permitted to enrol. 
6. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily 
prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug 
administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone

not expected to resolve and result in long lasting sequelae, such as neuropathy after platinum based 
therapy, are permitted to enrol. See protocol inclusion criterion 2) i) (5) for renal function eligibility. 
Neuropathy must have resolved to Grade 2 (NCI CTCAE version 4). 
9. Treatment with any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologics for cancer, or investigational therapy 
within 28 days of first administration of study treatment. 
Treatments 
All subjects were to be treated until recurrence of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of 
consent with a maximum of 1 year of treatment. 
Nivolumab dosing: Subjects randomised to the nivolumab treatment arm received nivolumab 240 mg 
as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 weeks (Q2W). 
Placebo dosing: Subjects randomised to the placebo arm received placebo as a 30 minute IV infusion 
Q2W.  
Tumour imaging assessments were to be performed every 12 weeks ≤ 1 week from the date of first 
dose to Week 96, then every 16 weeks < 2 weeks from Week 96 to Week 160, then every 24 weeks 
until non-urothelial tract recurrence or treatment was discontinued (whichever occurs later) for a 
maximum of 5 years.  
Subjects randomised to the nivolumab treatment arm received nivolumab 240 mg as a 30 minute IV 
infusion Q2W. Subjects randomised to the placebo arm received placebo as a 30 minute IV infusion 
Q2W. Placebo for nivolumab was the drug diluent alone, either a normal saline solution or a 5% 
dextrose solution. 
A data monitoring committee (DMC) was established and met regularly during the study to ensure the 
monitoring of subject safety and to provide oversight regarding safety and efficacy considerations in 
the protocol.

Selection of Doses Used in the Study 
The nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q2W was selected based on clinical data and modelling and simulation 
approaches using population PK (popPK) and exposure-response analyses of data from studies in 
multiple tumour types (melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and renal cell 
carcinoma) where body weight normalized dosing (mg/kg) has been used.

Objective 
Endpoint(s) 
Endpoint Description 
PRIMARY 
To compare the DFS 
DFS 
DFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization 
for nivolumab versus 
placebo in subjects 
with tumours 
expressing PD-L1 (≥ 
1% membranous 
staining in tumour 
cells) and all 
randomised subjects 
and the date of the first documented recurrence (local urothelial 
tract, local non urothelial tract or distant), or death (from any 
cause), whichever occurred first. Disease recurrence of the local 
urothelial tract was defined as any high and intermediate risk 
NMIBC and any new invasive urothelial carcinoma in the lower or 
upper urothelial tract (defined as T2 or greater), including lesions 
thought to be a second primary urothelial carcinoma. 
The primary definition of DFS accounted for subsequent 
anticancer therapy and new non-urothelial carcinoma primary 
cancer by censoring at the last evaluable disease assessment on 
or prior to the date of subsequent therapy/new non-urothelial 
carcinoma primary cancer. 
The secondary definition of DFS accounted for disease 
assessments occurring on or after initiation of subsequent 
anticancer therapy. The censoring scheme was the same as for 
the primary DFS definition except that new anticancer therapy 
censoring was ignored in this sensitivity analysis. The secondary 
definition of DFS accounted for new non-urothelial carcinoma 
primary cancer by censoring at the last evaluable disease 
assessment on or prior to the date of new non-urothelial 
carcinoma primary cancer. 
SECONDARY 
To evaluate NUTRFS 
NUTRFS 
NUTRFS was defined as the time between the date of 
in each randomised 
randomization and the date of first documented recurrence (local

To evaluate DMFS for 
DMFS 
DMFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization 
nivolumab versus

with tumours 
expressing PD-L1 (≥ 
1% membranous 
staining in tumour 
cells) and all 
randomised subjects  
and the date of first distant recurrence (non-local) or date of 
death (from any cause), whichever occurred first. For subjects 
who remained alive and distant recurrence-free, DMFS was 
censored on the date of last disease assessment. 
To evaluate TTR for 
TTR 
TTR was defined as the time between the date of randomization 
nivolumab versus 
placebo in subjects 
with tumours 
expressing PD-L1 (≥ 
1% membranous 
staining in tumour 
cells) and all 
randomised subjects 
and the date of first recurrence (local urothelial tract, local non-
urothelial tract or distant) or death due to disease (urothelial 
cancer), whichever occurred first. For subjects who remained 
alive and recurrence-free, TTR was censored on the date of last 
disease assessment.  
Death not due to disease was considered as a competing risk. 
Consequently, for subjects who died due to other cause than 
urothelial cancer, TTR in the analysis of cause-specific hazard 
analysis were censored on the date of death. 
To evaluate LRDFS 
LRDFS 
LRDFS was defined as the time between the date of

remained alive and locoregional recurrence-free, LRC was 
censored on the date of last disease assessment.  
Death not due to disease and distant metastasis was considered 
as a competing risk. Consequently, for subjects with distant 
metastasis prior to locoregional recurrence, LRC in the analysis of 
cause-specific hazard analysis was censored on the date of 
distant metastasis; and for subjects who died due to other cause 
than urothelial cancer, LRC in the analysis of cause-specific 
hazard analysis was censored on the date of death. 
To assess time from 
PFS2 
PFS2 was defined as the time from randomization to investigator-
defined disease progression after the subsequent next-line 
systemic anti-cancer therapy, or the start of second subsequent 
next-line systemic anti-cancer therapy, or to death from any 
cause, whichever occurred first. Subjects who were alive and 
without progression after start of the next line of systemic 
anticancer therapy were censored at last known alive date.

Indeterminate: Tumour cell membrane staining hampered for 
reasons attributed to the biology of the tumour sample and not 
because of improper sample preparation of handling. 
Not evaluable: Tumour tissue sample was not optimally collected 
or prepared and PD-L1 expression was neither quantifiable nor 
indeterminate. Not evaluable could be determined from H&E 
process before the tumour biopsy specimen was sent for PD-L1 
evaluation or from the H&E process during PD-L1 evaluation. 
Subjects with missing tumour cell PD-L1 expression were subjects 
with no tumour tissue sample available for evaluation. Tumour 
cell PD-L1 expression was collected in the IRT as well as the 
clinical database. 
PD-L1 CPS provides the number of PD-L1 positive tumour and 
immune cells as a proportion of viable tumour cells in a tissue 
sample using a single read.

more consecutive time points, where the first and last ADA-
positive samples are at least 16 weeks apart. Not Persistent

Overall Survival (OS)- The key second secondary endpoint of Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the 
time between the date of randomization and the date of death (of any cause). For subjects without 
documentation of death, OS will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive. OS 
will be followed continuously while subjects are on the study drug and every 3 months via in-person or 
phone contact after subjects discontinue the study drug. This endpoint will be analyzed in two different 
populations: Subjects with PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1%, and all randomised subjects. 
Disease Specific Survival (DSS)- The secondary endpoint DSS is defined as the time between the date 
of randomization and the date of death due to disease (urothelial cancer). For subjects without 
documentation of death, DSS will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive. DSS 
will be followed continuously as part of OS follow-up while subjects are on the study drug and every 3 
months via in-person or phone contact after subjects discontinue the study drug. This endpoint will be 
analyzed in two different populations: Subjects with PD-L1expression level ≥ 1% and all randomised 
subjects. 
Sample size 
DFS in all randomised subjects and DFS in subjects with PD-L1≥1% are dual endpoints, each type I 
error of 0.025 two-sided. Sample size was based on simulation based on the following assumptions. 
Under the assumption that PD-L1 is not a prognostic factor, in both control arms the same exponential 
cure rate distribution 
 was taken with median 12 months, a 5 year survival rate of 
32% based on historical data. In the experimental arm an exponential distribution with 3 months 
𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑝𝑝 + (1 − 𝑝𝑝)𝑒𝑒
−𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼
delayed treatment effect was assumed. During the trial the sample size was adapted from 600 to 640 
to 700, in response to different assumptions on the prevalence of PD-L1≥1% and a reality check on 
the assumed effect based on results in other trial. In the end, approximately 410 DFS events in all 
randomised subjects were estimated to provide around 87% power to detect an average HR of 0.72 
with an overall type I error of 2.5% (two-sided) in the all randomised, and approximately 162 DFS 
events in subjects with PD-L1≥1% (~294 subjects) were estimated for around 80% power to detect an 
average HR of 0.61 with an overall type I error of 2.5% (two-sided).

Randomisation 
After initial eligibility was established and the informed consent was obtained, subjects were enrolled 
into the study via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). Once enrolled in the IVRS, subjects 
who met all eligibility criteria were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the nivolumab or placebo treatment 
arm, stratified by the following factors; pathologic nodal status (N+ vs. N0/x with < 10 nodes removed 
vs N0 with ≥ 10 nodes removed), tumour cell PD-L1 expression (≥ 1%, < 1%, indeterminate), and 
use of cisplatin neo adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no). In order to be randomised, a subject must 
have had a tumour cell PD L1 expression level classification (≥ 1%, < 1%, indeterminate) as 
determined by the central laboratory. 
Blinding (masking) 
CA209274 is a randomised, double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Intercurrent events: censoring and competing risks 
Several of the secondary and exploratory endpoints have intercurrent events handled via censoring or 
as competing risk. 
Censoring: 
DFS was censored in case of start of subsequent therapy (primary definition) and new no-urothelial 
carcinoma (primary and secondary definition; see Table 10 for definitions and as such handled via 
hypothetical strategy. 
Similarly, NUTFRS was censored for subsequent therapy and new no-urothelial carcinoma.  
Competing risks (and treatment policy strategy) was handle as described in Table 11. 
Table 11 Competing events by endpoint 
Notably, DSS and TTR handle death not due to disease as competing risk and LRDFS and LRC handle 
distant recurrence as competing risk. For interpreting the effect on these endpoints, the effect on the 
competing risks should be taken into account.

Multiplicity 
Only DFS and OS were formally tested. DFS in PD-L1 ≥1% and DFS in all randomised were dual 
endpoints (both half of the total type I error,0.025 two-sided each). OS was hierarchically tested after 
DFS in each population, see Figure 7 and  
Figure 8. DFS had one interim at approximately 85% of the planned number of events in both 
populations. OS had two interim analyses. Both endpoints’ interim analyses had O’Brien-Fleming type 
group sequential boundaries based on the actual number of events observed using Lan-DeMets 
methods.  
The timing of the interim analyses is indicated below. In particular, the first interim analysis for OS 
(T2) takes place at a later time than the first interim for DFS (estimated 15 months later).

Figure 8 Multiple testing in PD-L1≥1% patients 
Statistical models and tests 
Analyses were stratified on 1) receipt of neo-adjuvant based chemotherapy, 2) N+ vs. N0/x with < 10 
nodes removed vs N0 with ≥10 nodes removed, and 3), in the all randomised population, PD-L1 ≥1% 
vs PD-L1 < 1% or indeterminate. 
Time to event endpoints without competing risks were analysed using Kaplan-Meier methodology, 
stratified log-rank test and Cox-proportional hazard models.  
Time to event endpoints with competing risks were analysed using cumulative incidence curves and 
Cox models for the cause specific hazards (i.e. censoring the competing risks). 
Assessment report

Supportive analyses for DFS included an unstratified log-rank test, multivariate Cox models with 
unbalanced prognostic factors, and analyses investigating the non-proportional hazard: a G(rho=0, 
gamma=1) Flemington-Harrington test which strongly downweighs early events and upweighs later 
events, a Cox analysis in the time frame < 6 months and one for > 6 months, and a test on 
proportional hazards by including a time by treatment interaction. 
Results 
Participant flow and recruitment 
The enrolment period lasted approximately 47 months (Mar-2016 to Jan-2020) and 1,075 subjects 
were enrolled at 170 sites in 30 countries. In total, 709 subjects were randomised. The last subject 
was randomised on 20 Jan 2020 in the all-randomised population, and the last patient last visit (LPLV) 
date (clinical cut-off) for this CSR occurred on 17-Jul-2020, providing a minimum follow-up of 5.9 
months. The last subject was randomised on 07-Jan-2020 in the PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1% 
population, providing a minimum follow-up of 6.3 months.  
Of the 709 total subjects randomised in Study CA209274, 353 subjects were randomised to the 
nivolumab arm and 356 subjects were randomised to the placebo arm. 699 (98.6%) subjects were 
treated with study drug (351 (99.4%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 348 (97.8%) subjects in the 
placebo arm) (Figure 9). 
At the time of the DBL, 610 (87.3%) subjects were continuing in the study, and 41 (5.9%) subjects 
were still on study treatment (21 (6.0%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 20 (5.7%) subjects in the 
placebo arm). The overall rates of discontinuation during the treatment period were 53.3% and 56.3% 
in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively. The most common reason for discontinuation of 
study drug in both treatment arms was disease recurrence (90 (25.6%) subjects in the nivolumab arm 
and 147 (42.2%) subjects in the placebo arm).  
Overall, 12 (1.7%) subjects withdrew consent and did not complete the treatment period.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for this study was dated 15-Jul-2015. The changes in the protocol as of 17-Jul-
2020 (clinical cut-off date) are summarized below. 
There were 5 global amendments, 11 country-specific amendments, and 8 administrative letters issued 
as of the clinical cut-off date. The rationale for key changes, such as changes to enrolled population, 
changes to statistical assumptions, updated exclusion criteria, and added formal OS interim analyses is 
provided below. 
Revised Protocol 01 (included Amendment 03, dated 21-Oct-2015; number of subjects 
randomised at time of protocol revision =0): 
The subject randomization rate was modified from 2:1 to 1:1, and the sample size of planned treated 
subjects was increased from 600 to 640 subjects; however, this revised protocol was finalized prior to 
any subjects being randomised in this study. 
Revised Protocol 02 (Amendment 10, dated 18 Aug 2016; number of subjects randomised at 
time of protocol revision =26): 
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022

Extended acceptable period of time between radical resection and randomization from 90 days to 120 
days; clarified pathology language for eligibility; clarified recurrence language, updated safety and 
contraceptive language to be consistent with the nivolumab Investigator Brochure version 15; other 
minor changes. 
Revised Protocol 03 (included Amendment 12, dated 18-Jul-2017; number of subjects 
randomised at time of protocol revision =252): The rationale for the changed PD-L1 positive 
percentage from 50% to 46% in accord with recently published data from the CA209275 
registrational study, and the 20% cap on the number of pelvis and ureter cancer subjects 
randomised to the CA209274 study. 
At the time the CA209274 protocol was written, the prevalence of urothelial tumour expression PD-L1 
at ≥ 1% was approximately 50%, based on preliminary results from the CA209032 and CA209275 
clinical trials in second-line urothelial cancer (UC). Given the competitive landscape, which included a 
similar study that was enrolling only PD-L1 positive subjects, a minimum of 50% PD-L1 positive 
enrollment was chosen for this study in order to maintain the expected prevalence. Final data from the 
CA209275 study was published in Lancet Oncology showing that tumours from 122 out of 265 subjects 
(46%) expressed PD-L1 at levels ≥ 1%. Therefore, the CA209274 protocol was amended to use the 
46% PD-L1-positive value as obtained in the CA209275 registrational study as the minimum 
percentage of PD-L1-expressing subjects to be enrolled in the CA209274 study. The percentage of PD-
L1 negative subjects was capped at 54%, and subsequent subjects enrolled in the PD-L1 positive 
cohort; there was no change in the planned accrual of 640 total randomised subjects. The Statistical 
Consideration section of the protocol was updated to reflect the change in expected sample size in the 
PD-L1 ≥ 1% randomised population and the minor change in power of the statistical tests. 
The CA209274 protocol was written with the intent that the study population would be representative 
of the world-wide UC population, to the extent possible. In older cohorts, it was estimated that 
approximately 90% of urothelial cancers originate in the bladder and the remaining 10% arise in the 
renal pelvis or ureter (upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC)). In studies assessing checkpoint inhibitors 
in the metastatic urothelial carcinoma setting, it is reported that the prevalence of UTUC disease can 
be as high as 20%. An assessment of the baseline disease characteristics of subjects being enrolled in 
the CA209274 study indicated that 137 subjects had bladder cancer primaries, and 68 had the primary 
tumour located in the renal pelvis or ureter. This 33% incidence of UTUC was therefore much higher 
than the expected value of approximately 10%. It is very likely that a competing study that was 
enrolling only subjects with bladder cancer was the driving factor for the high number of UTUC subjects 
enrolled in the CA209274 study. 
Little is known about the clinical outcomes of subjects with UTUC treated with checkpoint inhibitors and 
data suggest that UTUC may have a worse prognostic outlook than bladder cancer. Given that the 
primary site of disease was not a stratification factor, an overrepresentation of UTUC may lead to a 
disproportionate impact on treatment and reduced relevance for clinical practice, given the 
considerable deviation from the expected prevalence of this subset of subjects. Because of these 
considerations, this amendment capped the number of UTUC subjects enrolled in the CA209274 study 
at 20% of the planned 640 subjects. The 20% value, chosen to reflect the natural prevalence of UTUC 
diagnosis as supported by the studies mentioned above, provides a reasonable target, established in a 
large cohort of patients enrolled in these three international studies. Therefore, once approximately 
128 subjects with UTUC were enrolled, only subjects with bladder cancer were to be screened to 
complete the planned 640 subject enrollment in the CA209274 study. 
Revised Protocol 04 (included Amendment 15, dated 19-Dec-2018; number of subjects 
randomised at time of protocol revision =531): Revisions to exclusion criteria, rationale for 
removal of the cap on PD-L1 negative subjects, changes to statistical assumptions.

Two exclusion criteria were added to the protocol. These additions were instituted in all nivolumab 
protocols in the global development program: 
•  Restriction for participants receiving a live/attenuated vaccine within 30 days of randomization 
(e.g. varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)); 
• 
Treatment with botanical preparations (e.g. herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines) 
intended for general health support or to treat the disease under study within 2 weeks prior to 
randomization/treatment added; 
•  Removal of the cap on PD-L1 negative subjects:  
• 
The previous study design was based on an estimated prevalence of PD-L1 positive subjects of 
46%, and accordingly capped the number of PD-L1 negative subjects allowed into the study at 
54%. During the execution of the study, the prevalence of PD-L1 positive subjects has been 
demonstrated to be 42%. Revised protocol 04 removed the cap on PD-L1 negative subjects to 
ensure the population recruited was representative of the clinical population (i.e. with PD-L1 
positive of 42%), and ensured the study results were broadly applicable. 
Changes to statistical assumptions and analysis plan were made: 
•  A number of events in the adjuvant therapy landscape led to a reassessment of the CA209274 
statistical assumptions and analysis plan. Data from the publicly available CA209238 adjuvant 
melanoma study supported a greater clinical benefit of adjuvant nivolumab treatment in PD-L1 
positive population. IMvigor 010 is a randomised Phase 3 study assessing adjuvant 
atezolizumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) in a patient population similar to that of the CA209274 study. 
Upon accrual completion of IMvigor010 in Jun-2018, public information implied that this study 
had a more conservative target HR than the 0.69 target HR in CA209274. An internal 
assessment triggered by this understanding concluded that the initial protocol statistical 
assumptions were aggressive; consequently, a potential scenario could be the adjuvant 
nivolumab treatment resulting in clinically meaningful activity without reaching the level of 
significance, due to the rather aggressive initial statistical assumptions. In order to optimize 
the study design, reducing the chances of an active adjuvant treatment being dismissed on the 
basis of aggressive statistical assumptions a number of protocol assumptions were reviewed. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To address the concern that the initial study target HRs were overly aggressive compared to 
the IMvigor 010 study, more conservative HRs were targeted: 0.72 (all randomised subjects) 
and 0.61 (PD-L1 positive subjects), while maintaining adequate power for both primary 
endpoints. This resulted in a sample size increase from 640 to 700 subjects. 
The statistical model included a 3-month delayed treatment effect, based on observations on 
the pattern of clinical efficacy of nivolumab seen in other clinical settings (eg, CA209238 – 
adjuvant melanoma). Only the DFS nivolumab arm assumptions were changed by adding the 
3-month delayed treatment effect, but the cure rate model parameter remained the same.  
The planned DFS IA (for PD-L1 all-comers only) was planned for 65% events which was 
projected to occur in Jan-2019. If this DFS IA was positive, enrollment would close and the 
study would not complete accrual. In this scenario, the secondary endpoint readouts (e.g. 
NUTRFS, DSS, and OS) would likely be delayed and the power decreased due to lower total 
number of subjects.  
To mitigate the risk of the IA occurring before the enrollment was completed, the timing of the 
DFS IA was changed from an information fraction of 65% to 85%. With this change, expected 
number of DFS events for PD-L1 positive subjects would be enough to trigger an IA in this 
subgroup as well, and was formally added to the statistical design. Given the importance of OS 
Assessment report

Page 54/133 
 
 
 
to support the DFS primary endpoint, NUTRFS and DSS were removed from the testing 
hierarchy, but remained as important secondary endpoints. OS was made a key secondary 
endpoint and was tested following the hierarchical procedure after DFS. 
Revised Protocol 05 (dated 18-Oct-2019; number of subjects randomised at time of protocol 
revision =668): Rationale for the added formal interim OS analyses at the time of final DFS 
analysis for each of the 2 populations specified in the primary objective in order to provide 
an earlier assessment of OS. 
Following FDA interaction the MAH added a formal interim OS analysis at the time of the final DFS 
analysis for each of the 2 populations specified in the primary objectives. If DFS achieved the pre-
specified boundary for statistical significance at the DFS IA, the first interim OS analysis was to occur 
when 230 OS events in all randomised subjects and 91 OS events in subjects with PD-L1 expression 
≥ 1% was observed. If DFS achieved the pre-specified boundary for statistical significance at the final 
DFS analysis (410 DFS events in all randomised subjects and 162 events in subjects with PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1%), the first interim OS analysis was to occur at the same time (i.e. approximately 230 
OS events in all randomised subjects and 91 OS events in subjects with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% were 
to be expected).

Baseline data 
Overall, the median age of all randomised subjects was 67.0 years. Most subjects were white (75.6%), 
male (76.2%) and had an ECOG PS (based on case report form (CRF)) of 0 (62.8%). The predominant 
tumour type was urinary bladder (79.0% of subjects). Per case report form (CRF), 0.7%, 1.7%, 1.0%, 
3.8%, 17.9%, 57.8%, and 16.8% of all randomised subjects had Stage pTX, pT0, pTIS, pT1, pT2, pT3, 
and pT4A disease (tumour stage) at the time of resection, respectively.  
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics in randomised subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 
expression level ≥ 1% were consistent with that in all randomised subjects. Among subjects with 
tumour cell PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1%, demographic and disease characteristics were balanced 
between the two treatment arms (Table 14).

Numbers analysed 
The all-randomised and all-randomised with tumour cell PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1% populations were 
the primary populations used for efficacy analyses. Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses were 
performed based on the treatment arm “as randomised” (ie, using the intent-to-treat principle). Unless 
otherwise specified, the safety analyses were analyzed in all treated subjects and in all treated 
subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥1% populations (refer also to Figure 9). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy data presented are based on the clinical DBL on 27-Aug-2020 for the planned IA of DFS as 
specified in the protocol. 
At the time of the DBL, the median follow-up time was 20.90 months and 19.48 months for all 
randomised subjects in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively. In all randomised subjects with 
tumour cell PD L1 expression ≥ 1%, the median follow-up was 22.11 months for the nivolumab arm 
and 18.69 months for the placebo arm. The minimum follow up time was 5.9 months for all 
randomised subjects and 6.3 months for all randomised subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 
1%. 
The efficacy data was re-analysed and updated data were presented in a CSR Erratum based on a 13-
Apr-2021 DBL with data cut on the 27-Aug-2020 (reference is made below to “Updated with 
Reanalysis”). At the time of the 27-Aug-2020 DBL, the actual number of DFS events among all 
randomised subjects was 374 (91.2% of total DFS events). An IA for DFS was performed and the 
boundary for statistical significance for DFS (observed p-value = 0.0008) was crossed (adjusted alpha 
= 0.01784). The actual number of DFS events among all randomised subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 
expression level ≥ 1% was 136 (84.0% of total DFS events). An IA for DFS was performed and the 
boundary for statistical significance for DFS (observed p-value = 0.0005) was crossed (adjusted alpha 
= 0.01282). See Table 16. 
An Updated analysis with DBL 19-May-2021 with data cut on 01-Feb-2021 were presented during the 
procedure and is included in this section. This analysis is referred to as Updated analysis.

Feb-2021 DBL, 93 (66.4%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 81 (57.0%) subjects in the placebo arm 
were censored for DMFS. Among those censored, most were in follow-up (67 [47.9%] in the nivolumab 
arm and 44 [31.0%] in the placebo arm).  
At the 19-May-2021 DBL, median DMFS in subjects with tumor cell PD-L1 ≥ 1% was not reached in the 
nivolumab arm and 20.70 months (95% CI: 10.84, N.A.) in the placebo arm (HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 
0.41, 0.88).

Progression-free Survival on Next Line Systemic Therapy (PFS2) in All Randomised Subjects  
Nivolumab treatment resulted in an improvement in PFS2 in all randomised subjects (Table 16 and 
Figure 24). PFS2 rates were higher in the nivolumab arm than in the placebo arm at 6 months 
(95.1% vs 88.7%, respectively). At the time of the 01-Feb-2021 DBL, 245 (69.4%) subjects in the 
nivolumab arm and 231 (64.9%) subjects in the placebo arm were censored for PFS2.

Health-related Quality of Life in All Randomised Subjects and PD-L1≥1% subjects - 
Exploratory Endpoint 
Several questionnaires have been used: QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-3L. In all treatment groups baseline 
scores were comparable. Quality of life through Week 49 as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global 
Health Status scale remained stable in both treatment arms, with no mean change score from baseline 
reaching the minimal important difference for the subject (i.e. mean change ≥10 points) at any time 
point for either treatment arm. EQ-5D-3L utility index and EQ-5D VAS scores through Week 49 
remained stable in both treatment arms, with no mean change score from baseline reaching the MID 
for the subject at any time point for either treatment arm.

In a multivariate analysis of DFS in all randomised patients, the treatment effect when adjusted for 
age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), gender (male vs female), baseline ECOG status (0 vs 1 vs 2), and 
pathological status (pT0-2 vs. pT3 vs. pT4), was consistent with the primary DFS analysis. Pathological 
status pT0-2 vs pT4 was a significant prognostic factor for DFS. 
In a multivariate analysis of DFS in all randomised patients with tumour PD-L1 expression ≥1%, the

Post-hoc multivariate  analyses  to  explore  the  results  in  subgroups  based  on  prior 
neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and nodal status. 
To further explore the results of the subgroup analyses, the MAH has conducted some multivariate Cox 
proportional hazard model analyses with respect to baseline covariates on DFS (primary definition) to 
explore reasons that caused different outcomes in the placebo arm and variability of treatment effect 
in the subgroups.  
The following baseline covariates were considered in the full model: age (>= 65, < 65), sex (male, 
female), region (US, Europe, Asia, rest of world), ECOG PS (0, >=1), BMI (<= 25, > 25 to < 30, >= 
30), smoking status (current/former, never), tumour origin type (upper tract - renal pelvis/ureter, 
urinary bladder), minor histological variants (yes, no), nodal status (N0/X <10 nodes removed, N0 
>=10 nodes removed, N+), tumour stage (<=pT2, pT3-pT4a), prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin therapy 
(yes, no), baseline haemoglobin (<10 g/dL, >=10 g/dL), baseline creatine clearance (<60 mL/min, >= 
60 mL/min), baseline tumour cell PD-L1 expression (>=1%, <1%). Race distribution was overlapping 
with region and was not considered in the model. All variables used case report form (CRF) source and 
values entered as “not reported”, “not evaluable”, “unknown”, “indeterminate”, etc. were considered 
as missing value and were excluded from model fitting.  
For each multivariate model, the backward elimination method approach was used. This method of 
backward elimination starts with a full model including all baseline characteristics (as specified above) 
as covariates. The least significant variable is removed from the model until all covariates with a 
significance level greater or equal to 0.1 remain in the reduced model. The variable selection steps 
were done on the complete cases (non-missing for all baseline covariates in the full model) and 
repeated on the subjects with only non-missing baseline covariates in the reduced model. 
The following multivariate models were analysed: 
• 
• 
multivariate model within placebo arm subjects 
multivariate model in the ITT population with treatment group (nivolumab versus placebo) as a 
fixed covariate 
• 
multivariate model in the ITT population with treatment group (nivolumab versus placebo) and 
treatment-by-factor interaction as fixed covariates, where neoadjuvant cisplatin therapy and nodal 
status were investigated as treatment-by-factor interaction. 
The multivariate model within placebo arm subjects with the significant covariates after variable 
selection are presented in Table 28. In the placebo arm, the selected model comprised of 5 prognostic 
factors: age (p=0.1007), region (p=0.0637), nodal status (p<0.0001), tumour stage (p=0.0001), and 
prior neo-adjuvant cisplatin therapy (p=0.0177). As expected, the nodal status and prior neo-adjuvant 
cisplatin therapy, which were selected as randomization stratification factors, were found to be 
prognostic factors.   
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022  
Page 89/133 
 
 
 
 
Table 28 Multivariate model within placebo arm subjects with the significant covariates after variable 
selection 
Table 29 shows the multivariate model in the ITT population with baseline characteristics and 
treatment as covariates included. The treatment effect remains highly significant (p=0.0005); in 
addition, 3 other prognostic factors were found to be significant: sex (p=0.0929), nodal status 
(p<0.0001) and tumor stage (p=0.0003). Those previously identified prognostic factors from the 
placebo arm (region, use of cisplatin neo-adjuvant therapy and age) were no longer significant in 
presence of above covariates. The nodal status showed consistent significance in all models within the 
placebo arm and in the ITT population. The adjusted HR on DFS decreased slightly from 0.706 to 0.691 
after adjustment, suggesting that the treatment effect may be varying, in part, due to prognostic 
factors.  
Table 29 Multivariate model in the ITT population with baseline characteristics and treatment as 
covariates included 
Neoadjuvant Cisplatin therapy 
Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate neoadjuvant cisplatin therapy and its interaction with 
treatment group. Table 30 presents the unadjusted model (without including other baseline 
covariates) and the adjusted model (including other baseline covariates and variable selection). From 
both models, the interaction between neoadjuvant cisplatin therapy and treatment group remains 
significant at a level of 0.05 regardless of presence of other baseline covariates.  It should be noted 
that the study was not powered to detect interactions.

Nodal Status / Number of Resected Nodes 
Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate nodal status and number of resected nodes and its 
interaction with treatment group. Table 31 presents the unadjusted model (without including other 
baseline covariates) and the adjusted model (including other baseline covariates and variable 
selection). The multivariate analysis evaluating the impact of nodal status and number of resected 
nodes confirms the initial clinical interpretation of the results and the published data. It showed that 
the interaction between nodal status and treatment group is not significant in either the final or 
reduced model (Table 31).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design 
The randomised, double-blinded, nivolumab-placebo controlled study design that was used in study 
CA209274 is considered adequate to evaluate the benefits and risks of adjuvant nivolumab in patients 
who have undergone radical resection of MIUC originating in the bladder or upper urinary tract (renal 
pelvis or ureter) and are at high risk of recurrence.  
Study population  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for study CA209274 appear overall acceptable. However, it is 
uncertain whether the results obtained in MIBC patients can be regarded relevant for the UTUC

patients considering differences in the anatomic site, lymphogenic spreading pattern, early onset of 
(obstructive) symptoms and only a thin muscle layer in contrast to the bladder muscle layer. The 
course of disease and metastasis pattern might differ.  
The temporarily capped at 20% of the UTUC population is considered acceptable considering the 
general MIUC population.  
Both patients who have received cisplatin-based neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and who have not 
received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were allowed in the study. According to guidelines, neoadjuvant 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the treatment of choice, based on a meta-analysis that showed an 
improvement in OS of 50% versus 45%, HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.98) and a lower risk of recurrence 
(HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.90), resulting in a DFS advantage of 7% (Stadler, 2003). Patients who did 
not receive cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy either because non-eligible or because refusing 
adjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy were eligible to enter the study with an ECOG PS score of 2. This 
could potentially have led to the inclusion of patients who had a poorer health status compared to 
those eligible for neoadjuvant therapy, however this is excluded by demographics data. 
Treatments 
Since there is not a widely accepted adjuvant treatment regimen for this study population (ESMO 
guidelines 2019), a placebo is an acceptable comparator. The nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q2W is 
similar to the dose approved for locally advanced inoperable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma and 
therefore adequate. The additional 480 mg Q4W regimen is considered sufficiently substantiated and 
therefore acceptable (see clinical pharmacology section). 
Objectives and endpoints 
The objective of this study was to compare DFS for nivolumab versus placebo. The primary endpoint 
was DFS analysed in two different populations (dual-primary): subjects with PD-L1 expression 
level ≥1% and all randomised subjects.  
DFS as a primary endpoint of the pivotal study might be sufficient for registrational purposes when 
there is a clear treatment effect supported by a difference in plateaus in the Kaplan-Meier curves 
suggesting long-term benefit, and thus likely a higher cure rate. If this is not evident, OS data are 
normally needed for interpretation of the benefit of the investigational product in the adjuvant setting 
at hand (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). This is of the utmost importance to prevent patients to be treated 
with an adjuvant therapy in the absence of benefit, while being exposed to safety risks. 
Other endpoints were also analysed for the all-randomised and for the PD-L1≥1% group.  
The key secondary endpoint was OS. However, at the time of the 01-Feb-2021 cut-off date OS data 
were not mature [57.4% of the planned 404 OS events were observed for all randomized subjects and 
84 (50.6%) of the planned 166 OS events were observed for all randomized subjects with tumour cell 
PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1%] and did not meet the pre-specified boundary for declaring the statistical 
significance. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) therefore recommended to not release this 
information to BMS in alignment with the DMC charter. Following this recommendation, the study OS 
data remains blinded. Consequently, no OS summary is included in this report. OS data will however 
be reported upon formal submission when mature data become available.  
The other secondary endpoints, i.e. NUTRFS and DSS, were only supportive since their relation to 
clinical benefit is unclear and no formal comparison was done for these endpoints. DMFS was defined 
as an exploratory endpoint without correction for multiplicity testing and can be used only as 
supportive data.  The same holds for PFS2. The exploratory endpoints for ‘safety and tolerability’, TTR,

Page 95/133 
 
 
 
 
 
LRDFS, LRC are acceptable, however LRDFS and LRC are not commonly used endpoints in urothelial 
carcinoma.  
Statistical methods 
Only DFS and then OS were tested hierarchically, all other endpoints were only descriptive. DFS in PD-
L1 ≥1% and DFS in all randomised were dual endpoints (both of each were allocated half of the total 
type I error, 0.025 two-sided each). 
A stratified log-rank test (primary analysis) and Fleming-Harrington test (supportive analysis) for DFS 
were used. However, the Fleming-Harrington test downweighs early events and upweights late events 
and can therefore give statistically significant results without being clinically relevant, while for 
interpretation the Kaplan-Meier curves are needed. 
DFS in the primary definition was censored for both new subsequent therapy and new non-urothelial 
primary carcinoma. This may have led to informative censoring. The secondary definition of DFS which 
does not censor new subsequent therapy is more in line with the recommendation in EMA’s oncology 
guideline (CHMP/27994/2008 Rev. 1) and is therefore preferred. However, although it is recommended 
to not censor for subsequent therapy, subsequent therapy use is negligible and the primary definition 
results for DFS are very similar to those of the secondary definition.  
An interim analysis was conducted for DFS which is not recommended (CHMP/27994/2008 Rev. 1) in 
general, and specifically for the adjuvant setting where there is the risk that the desired long-term 
effects cannot be interpreted. 
Exploratory endpoint like disease specific survival and time to recurrence have death-not-due-to-
disease as a competing risk. Therefore, a beneficial effect on the event(s) of interest (in a certain time 
frame) may be at the cost of an adverse effect in the competing risk event (in that time frame), and 
vice versa. Therefore, endpoints with their competing risk analyses should be evaluated together with 
their competing risk. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Participant flow and recruitment 
In total 1075 subjects were enrolled at 170 sites in 30 countries and 709 subjects were randomised. 
The most common reason for not being randomised was due to patients no longer meeting the study 
criteria. This is considered acceptable. 
Study conduct 
During the study several amendments have been implemented such as increase of sample size, 
capping and de-capping to steer towards a realistic percentage of PD-L1 positive patients, changing 
the hierarchical testing procedure (OS became key secondary endpoint), and addition of a formal early 
OS interim analysis (FDA request) at the time of the DFS IA or when the final DFS analysis would have 
crossed the pre-specified boundary for statistical significance. Given the double-blind character of the 
study, these amendments are not likely to have affected the results of the study 
While the procedure was ongoing, the MAH discovered that the DFS data in the original CSR contained 
an error for 24 subjects in data capture on the case report form (CRF) that impacted either the status 
of DFS (censored vs event: recurrence or death) and/or time (date of recurrence). A restricted 
database re-lock and reanalysis were performed, and updated results for DFS, NUTRFS, and DMFS 
were provided in an erratum. The main cause for the DFS errors was determined to be the complexity 
in the collection of these data in the eCRF, resulting in some sites incorrectly recording the date and/or 
type of DFS event in the disease recurrence page. Further, data monitoring and risk mitigation were

Page 96/133 
 
 
 
 
 
not sufficiently adequate on this subject, particularly since these errors were discovered after 
questions by the FDA. Thus, trial oversight/data management has been suboptimal for this study. DFS 
errors specifically, were related to discordance between the first date a suspect lesion was identified 
and the date of recurrence confirmation at a later timepoint e.g. by additional procedures. As the time 
between the date of first identification of a lesion and the confirmation of that lesion by additional 
investigation is generally expected to be short, the errors are not considered to lead to major changes 
in the DFS data at least not when occurring in a low frequency, as was the case in the pivotal study. In 
conclusion, the data are considered sufficiently reliable for assessment.  
Demographics and other baseline characteristics 
Overall, the median age of all randomised subjects was 67.0 years. Most subjects were white (75.6%), 
male (76.2%) and had an ECOG PS of 0 (62.8%). The predominant tumour type was urinary bladder 
(79.0% of subjects). The demographics and other baseline characteristics were well balanced between 
both treatment arms in both the all randomised and the PD-L1≥1% populations. The population might 
be considered representative for the European patient population. Few patients with an ECOG =2 were 
included in the study (2.3%). Baseline demographic and disease characteristics in randomised subjects 
with tumour cell PD-L1 expression level ≥1% were consistent with that in all randomised subjects. 
Overall, in daily practice around half of patients are eligible for/willing to have such neoadjuvant 
treatment and this is reflected in the study population (43% having been pre-treated with cisplatin-
based chemotherapy). 
Primary endpoint-DFS 
Efficacy data presented is based on the clinical DBL on 27-Aug-2020 for the planned IA of DFS as 
specified in the protocol, with a median follow-up time of 20.90 months and 19.48 months (48% and 
57% events) for all randomised patients and 22.11 months and 18.69 months (39% and 57% events) 
for PD-L1 expression ≥1% patients in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively.  
Nivolumab as adjuvant therapy demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in the dual-primary 
endpoint of DFS vs placebo in subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 ≥1%: HR = 0.55 [98.72% CI: 0.35, 
0.85]; p-value = 0.0005). Median DFS was not reached in the nivolumab arm and was of 8.41 months 
in the placebo arm. DFS event- and censoring rates per 6 months to assess plateau formation in the 
KM curves were provided on request. The results indicate that while a definitive conclusion that DFS 
plateaus have been reached cannot be drawn yet for both study arms, the data are indicative that 
there is a trend towards such situation.  
The KM-curve for PD-L1 ≥1% patients show clear early separation of the curves and a plateau 
appears to be reached for DFS from 27 months onwards, however the small numbers at risk at that 
time do not allow for a definitive conclusion. A similar pattern is observed for the NUTRFS, DMFS and 
PFS2 results. Nonetheless, it appears that the efficacy in terms of DFS in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% patients is 
suggestive for long-term benefit.  During the procedure updated efficacy data was provided from a 
DBL on 19-May-2021 which translated into approximately 5 additional months of follow-up since the 
previous DBL. Updated DFS data continue to support a long term DFS effect in PD-L1 ≥ 1% patients. 
Also in the all randomised subject population a statistically significant outcome of the dual-primary 
endpoint of DFS was observed for nivolumab over placebo: HR = 0.70 [98.22% CI: 0.55, 0.90]; p = 
0.0008; median DFS of 20.76 months vs 10.84 months. However, there is extensive censoring in the 
KM curves. A similar pattern is observed in the KM-curves for NUTRFS (secondary endpoint) and for 
DMFS and PFS2 (exploratory endpoints). Updated DFS results are comparable to the primary analysis. 
DFS event and censoring rates were not provided, thus not allowing to evaluate a difference in 
plateaus in the DFS KM-curves that would be suggestive of long-term benefit.

Note that around 60% of the study population does not have a PD-L1 expression ≥1%. Regretfully no 
formal analyses were planned in the PD-L1<1% patients. The DFS subgroup results for these 
patients indicate a HR point estimate of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.03) with a median DFS of 17.68 months 
(95% CI: 14.06-22.37) in the nivolumab group versus 11.07 months (95% CI: 8.31-16.89) in the 
placebo group and overlapping CIs with similar updated results. The DFS KM-curve provided during the 
procedure indicates no clinically meaningful treatment effect in this subgroup, as the curves initially 
shows some separation, however after 18 months the curves converge with comparable event rates 
after 22 months in both study arms. KM-curves for the secondary endpoints also do not indicate 
clinically relevant efficacy in the PD-L1<1% population. Thus, the efficacy of nivolumab in ‘all 
randomised patients’ is driven by the efficacy in PD-L1≥1% patients. A pattern which is also apparent 
in the secondary and exploratory time to event endpoints (though not formally tested).  
To explore further the benefit in PD-L1<1% patients, the MAH performed a post-hoc exploratory 
analysis in this PD-L1 subgroup excluding UTUC patients (focussing on bladder cancer only patients) 
and observed a DFS HR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.53, 0.94). Notably, this exploratory analysis was conducted 
following explicit confirmation by the MAH that UTUC should be regarded as the same disease entity as 
MIBC and therefore included in the indication. Furthermore, it is not considered acceptable to deduce 
from a post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of a subgroup of patients (i.e. PD-L1<1%, bladder cancer 
only), that a beneficial effect can be shown while it is not shown for the entire PD-L1<1% population, 
particularly not in the absence of pre-planning, a biological rationale and/or replication.  
In conclusion, it remains unlikely that adjuvant nivolumab treatments results into a long-term benefit/ 
a higher cure rate in PD-L1<1% patients. Also taking into account that administration of this drug is 
associated with toxicity, it cannot be concluded that the B/R is positive in the PD-L1<1% population.  
Although it is recommended to not censor for subsequent therapy, subsequent therapy use is 
negligible and the primary definition results for DFS are very similar to those of the secondary 
definition.  
At the same time the HR for other subgroups showed substantial variability in the all randomised 
subjects population, which may be explained by several factors. The HR point estimate for DFS in 
the subgroup with neoadjuvant cisplatin was 0.52 while without cisplatin it was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.69, 
1.21). This may be explained by the fact that subjects with excellent response to neoadjuvant therapy 
(i.e., ypT0/Ta/Tcis/T1 and N0) were excluded from the study, thus selecting subjects with worse 
outcomes among those who had received neoadjuvant therapy. Post hoc models provided by the MAH 
indicate that the difference in effect depending on neoadjuvant cisplatin therapy is likely not a chance 
finding.  
In the PD-L1≥1% patients HR point estimates were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.22; 0.64) and 0.69 (95%CI: 
0.44; 1.08), respectively, showing the same pattern with prior cisplatin performing better. As these 
data are relevant for prescribers in clinical practice the data is reported in the SmPC. 
For patients with N0/x with less than 10 nodes removed the HR is 0.85 in all randomised and 0.87 in 
PD-L1≥1% patients. There is no clinical or mechanistical reason for a different effect and post hoc 
analyses provided by the MAH indicate that this may be a chance finding as there is no major 
difference in treatment effect within each subcategory of nodal status. The multivariate analyses 
confirmed subjects with N+ tumors have the worst treatment effect and benefit from nivolumab. It 
also showed that resecting less than 10 lymph nodes (or when the N status is unknown) is associated 
with a worse treatment effect compared to subjects with N0 status and 10 or more lymph nodes 
removed, observed in both treatment arms but emphasized in the nivolumab arm. It is questioned 
whether information on subgroups based on nodal status is useful considering the difficulty in reliably 
establishing the “true” nodal status and the likelihood of a chance finding.

Secondary Endpoints 
No data on key secondary endpoint OS were provided in the initial submission, as at the first pre-
specified interim analysis the pre-specified boundary for declaring the statistical significance was not 
met. Even if the absence of mature OS data constitutes a limitation in the context of the proposed 
adjuvant treatment, the size of the DFS effect in the PD-L1 ≥1% population is such that it is 
reasonably likely that a favourable effect on the long-term, including a higher cure rate, is achieved, 
while this is not the case for the PD-L1 <1% population. At least a detrimental effect on OS is 
considered very unlikely and the updated DFS together with the known safety profile of nivolumab 
result are sufficient to support clinical benefit in the PD-L1 ≥1% population. 
In order to further characterize the efficacy of nivolumab as adjuvant treatment of adults with muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinoma the MAH should submit the OS data from the 2nd IA and the final OS 
analysis of the Phase 3 CA209274 study for the PD-L1 ≥1% populations. 
NUTRFS 
No formal comparisons were planned for the secondary NUTRFS or exploratory endpoints, so these 
endpoints are merely descriptive for both primary populations.  
NUTRFS results in patients with PD-L1 ≥1% appears in support of DFS in patients with PD-L1 ≥1%, 
but the importance of this endpoint for clinical benefit in the target population is unclear and 
considering the chosen statistical strategy, results are descriptive. 
Exploratory endpoints  
DMFS, TTR, LRDFS, LRC, PFS2,   
The HR point estimate for DMFS (i.e. 0.75) in the all randomised patients showed a similar effect as 
DFS in favour of nivolumab over placebo. No formal comparison was done. Furthermore, the DMFS KM 
curves bend towards each other over time and also the CI of the median DFS overlap between the 
nivolumab and placebo arm. A similar notion can be made for the other exploratory endpoints, though 
merely descriptive.  
For patients with PD-L1 ≥1% the HR point estimates of the exploratory endpoints, show a similar 
effect as was observed for DFS in patients with PD-L1 ≥1%. Updated data support the primary 
analyses. 
However, in patients with PD-L1<1% the results in exploratory endpoints and the Kaplan-Meier 
plots are not indicative of benefit for this population. 
In conclusion, also for DMFS and the others exploratory endpoints (TTR, LRDFS, LRC, PFS2) these 
the results seem to be driven by PD-L1 ≥ 1% patients. 
Biomarker analysis 
The DFS efficacy of nivolumab vs placebo was considered in relation to PD-L1 tumour cell expression 
status (< 1%, ≥ 1%, < 5%, ≥ 5%, < 10%, and ≥ 10%) and to PD-L1 CPS populations (≥ 1, < 10, ≥ 
10), however, no optimal cut-off value could be defined with respect to PD-L1 expression.  
Quality of life 
Baseline data of QoL were comparable in both treatment groups and did not show a different effect 
from treatment between nivolumab and placebo during follow-up. Further, since results provided are 
merely descriptive for HrQoL exploratory endpoints, they are not reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022

Patients with a baseline performance score of ≥2 (except patients with a baseline performance score of 
2 who have not received cisplatin based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are considered ineligible for 
cisplatin adjuvant chemotherapy), evidence of disease after surgery, active autoimmune disease, or 
medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the clinical trial of 
adjuvant treatment of urothelial carcinoma. In the absence of data, nivolumab should be used with 
caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual 
basis (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
DFS results in the PD-L1≥1% population showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in DFS in patients treated with one year adjuvant nivolumab compared to placebo. 
Statistical significant and clinically meaningfulness are based on the HR, the median DFS and the 
pattern of the curve showing a plateau. Results in the secondary/exploratory endpoints provide 
confirmation support of long-term benefit in these patients.  
Even if lack of mature OS data constitutes a limitation in the context of the proposed adjuvant 
treatment, the size of the DFS effect in the PD-L1 ≥1% population is such that it is reasonably likely 
that a favourable effect on the long-term, including a higher cure rate, is achieved, while this is not the 
case for the PD-L1 <1% population. Based on the DFS results (extent and duration) at least a 
detrimental effect on OS is considered very unlikely and the updated DFS together with the known 
safety profile of nivolumab result are sufficient to support clinical benefit in the PD-L1 ≥1% population. 
This having said, the results of the planned 2nd OS IA in all randomised subjects with tumour cell PD-
L1 expression level ≥ 1% and final analysis for OS remain key to confirm the data showed by the DFS 
endpoint and should be provided as soon as available as an Annex II condition. 
The beneficial DFS effect for the all randomised patients (irrespective of PD-L1 expression) is driven 
by the PD-L1≥1% patients. In the all randomised patient population there is uncertainty about the 
sustainability of the treatment effect and taking into account that administration of this drug is 
associated with toxicity, it cannot be concluded that the B/R is positive in the PD-L1<1%.  
The finally agreed indication is as follows (text added):  
OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with muscle invasive 
urothelial carcinoma (MIUC) with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, who are at high risk of 
recurrence after undergoing radical resection of MIUC (see section 5.1). 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterize the efficacy of nivolumab as 
adjuvant treatment of adults with muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma the MAH should submit the OS 
data from the 2nd IA and the final OS analysis of the Phase 3 CA209274 study for the PD-L1 ≥1% 
population.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The existing safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy (240mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W) has been 
established across several tumour types, including of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma adults after failure of prior platinum containing therapy. 
The safety data for this extension of indication in patients with high risk muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma at radical resection is derived from Study CA209274 a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of nivolumab versus placebo in subjects who have undergone radical 
resection of MIUC originating in the bladder or upper urinary tract and are at a high risk of recurrence. 
Pooled safety data for all approved monotherapy indications are provided in the section “Safety in the 
SmPC”. 
Patient exposure 
Safety data in subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy (N = 351) and placebo (N = 348) are 
based on the clinical cut-off date of 17-Jul-2020 and database lock (DBL) date of 27 Aug 2020. The all 
treated population who received at least 1 dose of study drug was the primary population for safety 
analyses. The median follow-up time was 20.90 months and 19.48 months for all randomised subjects 
in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively. The minimum follow up time was 5.9 months for all 
randomised subjects.   
For a summary on cumulative dose and dose intensity refer to Table 33.  The median duration of 
therapy for all treated subjects was 8.77 months in the nivolumab arm and 8.21 months in the placebo 
arm, see also Table 34.

Adverse events (regardless of causality) 
Any-grade AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 347 (98.9%) subjects in the nivolumab arm 
and 332 (95.4%) subjects in the placebo arm (refer to Table 36 Table 36).

Table 37 Drug-related Adverse Events by Worst CTC Grade Reported in ≥ 5% of All Treated Subjects  
Exposure-adjusted adverse events rates 
When incidence rates (IR) were exposure adjusted, all-causality any grade AE IR within 30 days follow-
up were 1337.8 (events per 100 person-years) in the nivolumab arm and 1158.7 in the placebo arm. 
The most frequently reported AEs were within the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders (206.8 in the 
nivolumab arm and 208.5 in the placebo arm). Diarrhoea was the most frequently reported PT (62.8 in 
the nivolumab arm and 61.7 in the placebo arm). When IR were exposure-adjusted, drug-related AE 
IR within 30 days follow-up were 511.1 (events per 100 person years) with nivolumab treatment and 
274.3 with placebo treatment. Endocrine disorders (36.8 vs 4.9 events per 100 person years) and skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (80.2 vs 144.0 events per 100 person years) were observed more 
frequent in the nivolumab arm compared to placebo.  
Subgroup analyses of adverse events 
The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab and placebo arms for subgroups 
of age, gender, and geographic region were similar to the AE frequencies reported for the overall study 
population by treatment. 
The following numerical differences were observed: 
- In the Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorder system organ class (SOC), more all-causality 
and drug related AEs were reported in female subjects compared with male subjects in the nivolumab 
arm: 
•  Any grade all-causality AEs were reported in 47.1% female subjects and 36.0% male subjects. 
•  Any grade drug-related AEs were reported in 19.5% female subjects and 10.6% male subjects. 
- In the Nervous Systems Disorder SOC, more all-causality AEs were reported in female subjects 
compared with male subjects in the nivolumab arm: 
•  Any grade all-causality AEs were reported in 31.0% female subjects and 23.1% male subjects. 
- 
In the Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders SOC, more all-causality AEs were reported 
in female subjects compared with male subjects in the nivolumab arm: 
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022  
Page 104/133 
 
 
 
 
 
  
•  Any grade all-causality AEs were reported in 39.1% female subjects and 30.3% male subjects. 
- For subgroups based on race, most participants were in a single category (White) which limited the 
interpretability of potential differences  
- The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab and placebo arms for each 
geographic region subgroup (US or Europe or Asia) were similar to the frequencies of these types of 
AEs reported for the rest of the world (ROW) by treatment. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Any-grade all-causality SAEs (within 30 days of last dose) were reported in 104 (29.6%) subjects in 
the nivolumab arm and 105 (30.2%) subjects in the placebo arm (Table 38). Grade 3-4 SAEs were 
reported in 81 (23.1%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 73 (21.0%) subjects in the placebo arm. 
Table 38 Serious Adverse Events Reported in ≥ 1% of All Treated Subjects 
Any-grade drug-related SAEs (within 30 days of last dose) were reported in 32 (9.1%) subjects in the 
nivolumab arm and 7 (2.0%) subjects in the placebo arm. Grade 3-4 drug related SAEs were reported 
in 26 (7.4%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 6 (1.7%) subjects in the placebo arm. 
The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs were: 
Nivolumab: pneumonitis, colitis, and acute kidney injury (0.9% each). 
Placebo: colitis (0.6%).

Deaths 
As of the 27-Aug-2020 DBL, 95 (27.1%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 107 (30.7%) subjects in 
the placebo arm had died (Table 39). Disease progression was the most common cause of death for 
both arms.

Dose delays, infusion interruptions and infusion rate reductions 
Among all treated subjects, 162 (46.2%) subjects in the nivolumab arm had at least one dose delayed 
compared with 146 (42.0%) subjects in the placebo arm ( Table 42). 
Among all treated subjects, 12 (3.4%) subjects in the nivolumab arm had at least 1 infusion 
interruption compared with 6 (1.7%) subjects in the placebo arm. The most common reason for 
infusion interruptions in both treatment arms was a hypersensitivity reaction (16 (59.3%) subjects in 
the nivolumab arm and 3 (42.9%) subjects in the placebo arm). Among all treated subjects, 6 (1.7%) 
subjects in the nivolumab arm had an infusion rate reduction compared with 2 (0.6%) subjects in the 
placebo arm. The most common reason in both treatment arms was other (12 (60.0%) in the 
nivolumab arm and 2 (100.0%) subjects in the placebo arm). 
Table 42 Dose Delays of Study Therapy - All Treated Subjects 
Adverse events leading to dose delay 
Any-grade all-causality AEs leading to dose delay were reported in 117 (33.3%) subjects in the 
nivolumab arm and 90 (25.9%) subjects in the placebo arm. Grade 3-4 AEs leading to dose delay were 
reported in 49 (14.0%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 32 (9.2%) subjects in the placebo arm. 
The most frequently reported all-causality AEs leading to dose delay were: 
•  Nivolumab: urinary tract infection (4.0%), diarrhoea (3.4%), increased blood creatinine 
(2.6%), increased lipase (2.0%), increased alanine aminotransferase (1.7%), and pneumonia 
(1.7%). 
• 
Placebo: diarrhoea (4.3%), urinary tract infection (3.4%), increased blood creatinine (2.6%), 
and hydronephrosis (1.4%). 
Any-grade drug-related AEs leading to dose delay were reported in 55 (15.7%) subjects in the 
nivolumab arm and 34 (9.8%) subjects in the placebo arm. Grade 3-4 AEs leading to dose delay were 
reported in 16 (4.6%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 7 (2.0%) subjects in the placebo arm.  
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs leading to dose delay were: 
•  Nivolumab: diarrhoea (3.1%), increased alanine aminotransferase, and increased lipase (1.4% 
each).

Select adverse events 
In order to characterize adverse events (AEs) of special clinical interest that are potentially associated 
with the use of nivolumab, the MAH identified select AEs based on the following 4 guiding principles: 
AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies, AEs that 
may require immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids) as part of their management, AEs whose early 
recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity and AEs for which multiple event terms may 
be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby necessitating the pooling of terms for full 
characterization. A summary of drug-related select AEs is shown in Table 43.

Placebo: colitis (0.6%). 
Across the select AE categories, the majority of events were manageable using the established 
algorithms in the nivolumab arm ( Table 44), with resolution occurring when IMMs (mainly systemic 
corticosteroids) were administered. Most drug related select AEs with nivolumab treatment (ranging 
from 58.2% to 100.0% across categories) had resolved at time of the DBL. Some endocrine select AEs 
were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy.

Subjects (N = 351) 
Immune-mediated adverse events 
IMAEs are specific events (or groups of PTs describing specific events) that include diarrhoea/colitis, 
hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis and renal dysfunction, rash, and endocrine (adrenal insufficiency, 
hypophysitis, hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes mellitus). IMAE analyses 
included events, regardless of causality, occurring within 100 days of the last dose (i.e., with extended 
follow-up). These analyses were limited to subjects who received an IMM for treatment of the event, 
with the exception of endocrine events, which were included in the analysis regardless of treatment 
since these events are often managed without immunosuppression. In addition, these events were 
identified by the investigator as IMAEs with no clear alternate aetiology and an immune mediated 
component. 
The majority of IMAEs were Grade 1-2 (Table 45). 
Across IMAE categories, the majority of events were manageable using established management 
algorithms, with resolution occurring when IMMs (mostly systemic corticosteroids) were administered. 
Some endocrine IMAEs, were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone 
replacement therapy. A re-challenge was considered as an unsuccessful or positive re-challenge if, 
after resolution of the IMAE, a new IMAE of the same type occurred with re treatment. A re-challenge

Other Events of Special Interest 
Other events of special interest (OESIs) are events that do not fulfil all criteria to qualify as select AEs 
or IMAEs. These events may differ from those caused by non-immunotherapies and may require 
immunosuppression as part of their management. 
Overall, OESIs were reported in 8/351 (2.3%) subjects (10 OESIs) in the nivolumab arm and 4/348 
(1.1%) subjects in the placebo arm. 9/10 (90.0%) OESIs in the nivolumab arm and 3/4 (75.0%) 
OESIs in the placebo arm were resolved at the time of the DBL.  
Among both treatment arms, the following OESI categories had no reported events: encephalitis, 
Guillain-Barré syndrome, and graft versus host disease. 
Drug-related OESIs are summarized in Table 46

There were in total 6 subjects with concurrent ALT or AST > 3x ULN with T.BILI > 2x ULN within one 
day of which 4 cases within 30 days of last dose of nivolumab, and 2 cases occurred > 30 days of the 
last dose of nivolumab. From these patients there were two patients with a DILI related to nivolumab 
treatment. The events occurred 72 days after the 5th (last) nivolumab infusion and 19 days after the 
7th nivolumab infusion respectively. For both patients the abnormal liver functions resolved after 
treatment. 
The other cases were assessed as not related to nivolumab treatment. The abnormal liver functions 
were caused by cholecystitis (2 patients), a bile duct stone and a biliary/pancreatic duct dilatation due 
to a possible pancreatic malignancy. In 3 out of 4 patients these events resolved after treatment. One 
patient died due to the consequences of a sepsis caused by a cholecystitis.

Most subjects with at least 1 on-treatment measurement had normal creatinine values during the 
treatment reporting period. 
The abnormalities in creatinine (increased) were primarily reported as Grade 1 to 2 in severity. 6 
(1.7%) subjects in the nivolumab arm and 8 (2.4%) subjects in the placebo arm had a Grade 3 
increased creatinine level, and 1 subject in the placebo arm had a Grade 4 increased creatinine level. 
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) increases (> ULN) from baseline (≤ ULN) were reported in 73/339 
(21.5%) subjects in the nivolumab arm, and 37/335 (11.0%) subjects in the placebo arm (Table 48). 
The proportion of subjects with TSH increases (> ULN) was higher in the nivolumab arm than the 
placebo arm. Decreases (< lower limit of normal (LLN)) from baseline (≥ LLN) were reported in 85/339 
(25.1%) subjects in the nivolumab arm, and 32/335 (9.6%) subjects in the placebo arm.

Immunogenicity 
Of the 305 nivolumab ADA evaluable subjects in the nivolumab arm, 13 (4.3%) subjects were 
nivolumab ADA positive at baseline and 42 (13.8%) subjects were treatment-induced nivolumab ADA 
positive after the start of treatment.  
• 
No subjects were considered persistent positive and 5 (1.6%) subjects were neutralizing ADA 
positive.  
• 
The highest titer value observed in nivolumab ADA positive subjects was 128, which occurred 
in 1 subject. All other titers were low, ranging from 0 to 32.

Based on the assessment of the presence of ADA and neutralizing antibodies in relation to DFS per 
investigator, there was no apparent trend showing an effect of ADA or neutralizing antibodies on the 
efficacy of nivolumab. Overall, the incidence of nivolumab ADA was 13.8%, and did not appear to have 
an effect on safety of the tested regimen. Of all the nivolumab treated subjects who were evaluable for 
ADA, hypersensitivity/infusion reaction select AEs were experienced by 12 (4.6%) nivolumab ADA 
negative subjects, and 1 (2.4%) nivolumab ADA-positive subject.  
Safety in special populations 
The MAH has provided safety data comparing all treated subjects to all treated subjects with tumour 
cell PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1%. The safety data in the latter subgroup was consistent with that 
reported in the all treated population. 
The frequencies of total AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs by MedDRA High-level Group 
Term (HLGT)/standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs)/SOC by age group (< 65, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 
years) are presented for nivolumab and placebo-treated subjects in CA209274 (Table 50), and pooled 
monotherapy studies (Table 51).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with nivolumab. No new 
information has been generated in support of this submission. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Any-grade AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were reported in 64 (18.2%) 
subjects in the nivolumab arm, and 32 (9.2%) subjects in the placebo arm (Table 52). Grade 3-4 AEs 
leading to discontinuation were reported in 39 (11.1%) subjects in the nivolumab arm, and 21 (6.0%) 
subjects in the placebo arm. 
The most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation were: 
• 
•

Post marketing experience 
Nivolumab was first approved on 04-Jul-2014 in Japan for unresectable melanoma and has since been 
approved in multiple countries, including the US and in the European Union (EU), and for other 
indications as monotherapy (e.g. metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC), classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
(SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma (UC), and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In US, 
nivolumab monotherapy was also approved for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), microsatellite 
instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), and 
small cell lung cancer (SCLC)).  
Based on pharmacovigilance activities conducted by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) World Wide Patient 
Safety, review of post-marketing safety data is consistent with, and confirms the clinical trial safety 
data for nivolumab. 
Safety in SmPC 
Safety data to support Section 4.8 of the SmPC were integrated by the MAH across completed studies 
in multiple indications using the intended dose and regimen for nivolumab monotherapy. Also the 
Assessment report

Page 118/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following methodology was used to generate the adverse drug reactions table with nivolumab 
monotherapy in Section 4.8 of the SmPC: 
1) 
Programmatically remap MedDRA PTs representing the same or similar clinical conditions for 
the integrated AE data and generate summary tables. 
2) 
Identify clinical relevant events based on BMS medical review of the drug-related remapped AE 
summary table. 
3) 
Present resulting clinically relevant remapped events by SOC and all-causality frequency in the 
final adverse drug reaction (ADR) table. 
In the ADR table in Section 4.8 of the proposed OPDIVO SmPC for the current application, some 
footnotes have been revised or deleted for the following reasons: 
• 
The footnote on cardiac disorders system organ class (previously treated melanoma indication 
only) has been deleted to simplify the ADR table footnotes and to align with the approved Risk 
Mitigation Plan as cardiac arrhythmias was removed from the list of important potential risks based on 
the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) procedure 9. ‘Arrhythmia (including ventricular arrhythmia)’ 
PT is included in the ADR table. ‘Ventricular arrhythmia’ is remapped under ‘arrhythmia’ per remapping 
definition output. 
• 
‘Rash generalized’ and ‘rash papulosquamous’ were deleted from the ‘rash’ footnote as these 
PTs were not included in the remapping definition output. Although ‘Pemphigoid’ is not included in the 
remapping definition output, it is included under ‘rash’ for frequency calculation purpose.  
A comparison between the safety in nivolumab treated subjects in CA209274 and the safety in pooled 
nivolumab monotherapy studies excluding CA209274 is made in Table 53  
•  Any grade all-causality AEs frequencies were higher in nivolumab monotherapy treated subjects in 
CA209274 vs the pooled nivolumab monotherapy studies, excluding CA209274 for; diarrhea

Nivolumab Monotherapy 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile for nivolumab monotherapy (240mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W) has previously been 
established across several tumour types, including urothelial carcinoma. The safety profile described in 
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022  
Page 120/133 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this procedure is based on the safety data derived from study CA209274; a phase 3, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study of nivolumab vs placebo in adult subjects who have undergone 
radical resection of MIUC originating in the bladder or upper urinary tract (renal pelvis or ureter) and 
are at high risk of recurrence.  
Exposure 
The median follow-up time was comparable for both study arms (20.90 months and 19.48 months for 
all in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively). The median duration of therapy was comparable 
between the treatment arms 8.77 months in the nivolumab arm and 8.21 months in the placebo arm. 
In relation to the proposed target population and posology (up to 1 year) the extent of exposure in the 
nivolumab arm is considered to be a bit short, however can be considered acceptable for assessment 
of the B/R considering the available safety data from other approved indications. The number of dose 
delays was comparable between the two study arms (46.2% in the nivolumab arm vs 42.0% in the 
placebo arm). 
Adverse Events (AEs) 
Nearly all patients experienced an AE (98.9% patients in the nivolumab arm and 95.4% in the placebo 
arm). The most frequent any-Grade all-causality AEs in the nivolumab arm were pruritus (30.2% vs 
16.2%), diarrhoea (29.1% vs 26.1%), fatigue (27.4%vs 24.4%), urinary tract infection (19.9% vs 
19.0%), and rash (18.8% vs 9.8%). The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were pruritus 
(23.1% vs 11.5%), fatigue (17.4% vs 12.1%), and diarrhoea (16.8% vs 10.9%) in the nivolumab and 
placebo arm, respectively. There were more Grade 3-4 AEs (regardless of causality) observed in the 
nivolumab arm (42.2%) compared to the placebo arm (35.1%). The most frequently reported Grade 
3-4 AEs were increased lipase (6.3%), urinary tract infection (5.4%vs 6.4%), increased amylase 
(4.6% vs 1.7%), malignant neoplasm progression (1.7% vs 3.7%), and diarrhoea (1.7% vs 1.1%). 
When incidence rates (IR) were exposure adjusted, all-causality any grade AE were more frequent in 
the nivolumab arm (1337.8 events per 100 person-years) compared to the placebo arm (1158.7). 
Particularly endocrine disorders and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were observed more 
frequent in the nivolumab arm compared to the placebo arm. This is in line with the known safety 
profile of nivolumab monotherapy. 
No new safety concerns have arisen from this study, however some AE are more frequently observed 
in this population compared to the pooled nivolumab monotherapy population. These data were also 
compared for the purpose of assessment of the proposal for pooled safety data in the SmPC. The most 
notable differences in frequencies of any grade all-causality AEs between study CA209274 and the 
pooled nivolumab monotherapy studies, excluding CA209274, were AEs pruritus (30.2% vs 18.4%), 
urinary tract infection (20.2% vs 5.0%), hyperkalemia (6.8% vs 2.4%), blood creatinine increased 
(13.7% vs 5.0%), lipase increased (11.7% vs 4.1%) and amylase increased (12.5% vs 3.3%). These 
AE are considered to be specific for the disease setting of urothelial cancer. Besides these disease-
specific AEs, the safety profile of nivolumab in study CA209274 is similar to the safety profile of the 
pooled nivolumab monotherapy population. Therefore, pooling the safety data of nivolumab from study 
CA209274 with data from other nivolumab monotherapy indications in the SmPC is considered 
acceptable. 
Serious Adverse Events and deaths 
A comparable number of SAEs were observed in the nivolumab and placebo arm (29.6% vs 30.2%). 
The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs in the nivolumab arm were urinary tract infection 
(2.6% vs 6.0%), malignant neoplasm progression (2.3% vs 5.5%), intestinal obstruction (1.4% vs 
1.4%), acute kidney injury (1.4% vs 0.3%). Also the number of severe SAEs was comparable between 
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022  
Page 121/133 
 
 
 
 
 
the study arms (23.1% vs 21.0%). More SAEs were related to treatment in the nivolumab arm (9.1%) 
compared to placebo (2.0%), however the increased number could not be attributed to specific SAEs. 
Due to the immaturity of OS data at the time of this IA, the MAH remained blinded to deaths by 
treatment arm so no information about these events has been included at the initial submission 
however the number of deaths was comparable between the study arms (nivolumab: 27.1% vs 
placebo 30.7%). In the nivolumab arm there were less deaths due to the disease (20.8% vs 25.9%). 
Of note, 2 patients died due to study drug toxicity in the nivolumab arm (one for immune-mediated 
pneumonitis and one for pneumonitis). The number of deaths due to other reasons was comparable 
(nivolumab: 4.8% vs placebo: 4.0%) between the study arms. 
Other AEs of interest 
AEs with potential immune-related aetiology consistent with the mechanism of action of 
immunotherapies/ nivolumab (select AEs (74.9% vs 55.5%), immune-mediate AEs (IMAEs; non-
endocrine IMAEs treated with immune-modulating medication and endocrine IMAEs with or without 
immune-modulating medication: 34.5% vs. 6.9%and other AEs of special interest (OESIs; 2.0% vs 
1.1%) were observed more frequently in the nivolumab arm compared to the placebo arm.  The 
majority of the select AEs and IMAEs were low grade and resolved mostly by dose interruptions and 
corticosteroid therapy prior to database lock.  
Dose delays 
The number of dose delays was comparable between the nivolumab and placebo arm (46.2% vs 
42.0%), however there were slightly more dose interruptions in the nivolumab arm compared to the 
placebo arm. (3.4% vs 1.7%). There were also slightly more any grade all-causality AEs leading to 
dose delay in the nivolumab arm (33.3%) compared to the placebo arm (25.9%), this was also seen 
for severe AEs (14.0% vs 9.2%).  
Laboratory abnormalities, vital signs 
In general, most laboratory abnormalities were low grade. There were 6 patients in the nivolumab 
arm, who had concurrent ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN within one day. From 
these patients there were two patients with a DILI related to nivolumab treatment. The events 
occurred 72 days after the 5th (last) nivolumab infusion and 19 days after the 7th nivolumab infusion 
respectively. For both patients the abnormal liver functions resolved after treatment. This is considered 
acceptable. Vital signs were not systematically collected but reported as AE when abnormal and 
deemed to be clinically significant. It is acknowledged that this is a limitation to the above data. The 
presented data in itself do not indicate large differences between the two study arms and are therefore 
considered acceptable.   
Immunogenicity 
In the nivolumab arm there were no patients who were consistently Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) positive 
and the number of patients with neutralizing ADAs was small (1.6%). Therefore, no conclusion can be 
made regarding the impact in the efficacy and safety of neutralizing ADAs in these patients -, however 
considering the very low number of neutralizing ADAs, this is considered acceptable. 
Special populations  
The MAH provided safety data by age group. From these data it appears that patients ≥75 years of 
age in the nivolumab arm experience certain type of AEs more frequent, such as SAEs, psychiatric and 
nervous system disorders. The number of patients ≥75 years, however, is too limited to draw a 
definitive conclusion on these patients.

EMA/155845/2022

Discontinuation due to AEs 
Nivolumab treatment was less tolerable compared to placebo, as shown by the higher number of 
discontinuations due to AEs (18.2% vs 9.2% respectively). The discontinuations due to AEs were 
mostly due to severe AEs in both study arms and mostly treatment related in the nivolumab arm. The 
discontinuations could not be attributed to a certain AE. 
SmPC 
Safety data from the pivotal study was combined with multiple indications using the intended dose and 
regimen for nivolumab monotherapy. In addition, the MAH remapped similar MeDRA PTs, which is 
considered acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns have arisen for nivolumab monotherapy in the adjuvant treatment for adult 
subjects who have undergone radical resection of MIUC originating in the bladder or upper urinary 
tract (renal pelvis or ureter) and are at high risk of recurrence.  
The toxicity of treatment with nivolumab is slightly worse as shown in the higher number of severe AEs 
and exposure adjusted, all-causality any grade AE in the nivolumab arm compared to the placebo arm. 
Nivolumab treatment was also slightly less tolerable as could be seen in the higher number of dose 
delays and discontinuations due to AEs. Nonetheless, this is considered acceptable since overall the 
toxicity profile is manageable, and the differences between the nivolumab arm and placebo arm were 
generally small. Overall, no critical safety issues were identified. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As  a  result  of  this  variation,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4, 4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC  and  Annex  II  are  being 
updated  to  add  the  data  of  study  CA209274  in  high  risk  MIUC  patients.  The  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  is 
updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The inclusion of the new proposed indication for Opdivo (i.e. adjuvant treatment of adult patients with 
muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIUC).) does not have a relevant impact on the PIL and 
therefore it is agreed with the MAH that there is no need to conduct additional consultation with target 
patients groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The final approved indication is: “OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of 
adults with muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIUC) with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, 
who are at high risk of recurrence after undergoing radical resection of MIUC (see section 5.1). 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Urothelial carcinoma (UC) originates in the urothelial cells that line the bladder, ureter, and renal 
pelvis. The majority (90%) of UCs originate in the urinary bladder, while up to 10% originate in the 
upper urinary tract (ureters and/or renal pelvis) (Hepp et al, 2020; Miyazaki & Nishiyama, 2017). 
Around 20% of UCs present with or eventually progress to muscle invasive or metastatic disease. 
Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an aggressive disease that requires multimodal treatment, 
Assessment report  
EMA/155845/2022  
Page 127/133 
 
 
 
 
 
which includes radical surgery or radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Studies report a 
median survival which ranges between 3.8-5.2 years (Supit 2014, Mitra 2011; Barton Grossman 
2003). 
Muscle invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is less common. From the literature it is not 
clear whether UTUC is the same or a different disease entity as MIBC. However, due to the different 
anatomic site and lymphogenic spreading pattern the course of disease and metastasis pattern may 
differ. Similar to MIBC, muscle invasive UTUC is an aggressive disease that requires radical surgery 
with a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 30 months. Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy could 
improve DFS in muscle invasive UTUC based on the results of the POUT (Peri-Operative chemotherapy 
versus surveillance in UTUC) study, but OS data were not available (Birtle A,2020).  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Despite multimodal treatment, more than 50% of patients with MIBC will eventually develop 
metastases; upon metastatic relapse, the prognosis is dismal, with a median overall survival (OS) up 
to 15 months with chemotherapy alone and to up to 21 months when maintenance checkpoint inhibitor 
is added for patients without disease progression after completing first line therapy. 
The ultimate goal of adjuvant therapy is to demonstrate a favourable and sustained effect on DFS, i.e. 
in analyses conducted when recurrence rates have reached an apparent plateau, likely to translate in 
an OS benefit. Currently, no agent is approved in the adjuvant treatment for MIUC. Of note, recently 
the results of the IMvigor010 study with adjuvant atezolizumab in a similar patient population did not 
show a statistically significant improvement of DFS (Bellmunt, 2021). 
There exists an unmet need in patients who have high risk residual disease following RC, regardless of 
whether they received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, in particular if they are not eligible for cisplatin-
based adjuvant chemotherapy due to the dismal prognosis of these patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The CA209274 study is a 1:1 randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to determine the 
efficacy of 1 year adjuvant nivolumab in high risk MIUC patients who have undergone radical surgery, 
with or without neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. There were N=353 patients included in the 
nivolumab arm and N=356 in the placebo arm. These numbers were respectively N=140 and N=142 
for the PD-L1≥1% patients. The dual-primary endpoint was DFS in patients with PD-L1≥ 1% and in the 
all randomised patients group. Secondary endpoints were OS, NUTRFS and DSS also to be determined 
in patients with PD-L1≥ 1% and in all randomised patients. No formal comparison was planned for 
NUTRFS, DSS and exploratory endpoints (including DMFS). 
Efficacy data presented are based on the clinical DBL on 27-Aug-2020 for the planned IA of DFS as 
specified in the protocol, with a median follow-up time of 20.90 months and 19.48 months (48% and 
57% events) for all randomised patients and 22.11 months and 18.69 months (39% and 57% events) 
for PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% patients in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively. In the requested 
updated analysis the DBL is 19-May-2021, which translates into approximately 5 additional months of 
follow-up since the previous DBL. 
The dosing regimen evaluated in study CA209274 was nivolumab 240 mg Q2W but an additional dose 
480 mg Q4W is proposed based on a model-based bridge.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
DFS 
In the PD-L1≥ 1% patients the dual-primary endpoint DFS showed a statistically significant effect 
favouring nivolumab over placebo (HR = 0.55 [98.72% CI: 0.35, 0.85]; p = 0.0005) (DBL 27-Aug-
2020). The median DFS was 8.41 (95% CI: 5.59, 21.19) months in the placebo group and N.A. (95% 
CI 21.19, N.A) in the nivolumab group. The DFS KM curves for PD-L1≥ 1% patients show a clear 
separation of the curves and plateaus appear to be reached at the end of the curves. 
The DFS results analysed according to the secondary definition of DFS (EMA preferred analyses) are 
comparable to the primary definition in both populations.  
Updated DFS data (DBL 19-May-2021) continue to support a long term DFS effect in PD-L1 ≥ 1% 
patients (SmPC Table 36)  
NUTRFS 
In the PD-L1≥ 1% population the NUTRFS HR is 0.55 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.79) and the median was 
N.A. (95% CI: 24.57, N.A.) in the nivolumab arm and 10.84 (95% CI: 5.65, 22.14) in the placebo arm 
(no formal comparison). The NUTRFS KM curve for PD-L1≥ 1% patients showed a clear separation of 
the curve and plateaus.  
Updated NUTRFS data (DBL 19-May-2021) continue to support the NUTRFS effect in PD-L1 ≥ 1% 
patients 
Exploratory endpoints 
Exploratory endpoints DMFS, TTR, LRDFS, LRC and PFS2 have a comparable HR to the dual-primary 
endpoints in PD-L1≥ 1% patients. In PD-L1≥ 1% patients the KM curves for DMFS and PFS2 
separated and appear to reach plateaus.  
Posology 
To support the 480 mg Q4W dosing, nivolumab exposures were compared with 240 mg Q2W dosing 
considering the adjuvant MIUC population and the advanced UC population (already approved). Similar 
or higher exposures Cmin and Cave (steady-state) of nivolumab are expected in subjects with 
adjuvant treatment of MIUC with 480 mg Q4W compared to subjects with advanced UC treated with 
240 mg Q2W, which is approved in the EU. Since the site of action is the same for the adjuvant 
treatment of MIUC as for treatment of advanced UC, these comparable nivolumab exposure data from 
advanced UC are considered supportive for efficacy for the 480 mg Q4W dosing regimen for the 
adjuvant treatment of MIUC. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The absence of mature OS data constitutes a limitation in the context of the proposed adjuvant 
treatment. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequent any-Grade all-causality AE in the nivolumab arm were pruritus (30.2% vs 16.2%), 
diarrhoea (29.1% vs 26.1%), fatigue (27.4% vs 24.4%), urinary tract infection (19.9% vs 19.0%), 
and rash (18.8% vs 9.8%). When incidence rates (IR) were exposure adjusted, all-causality any grade

AE were more frequent in the nivolumab arm (1337.8 events per 100 person-years) compared to the 
placebo arm (1158.7). 
There were more Grade 3-4 all causality AEs observed in the nivolumab arm (42.2%) compared to 
the placebo arm (35.1%). The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs were increased lipase (6.3%), 
urinary tract infection (5.4%vs 6.4%), increased amylase (4.6% vs 1.7%), malignant neoplasm 
progression (1.7% vs 3.7%), and diarrhoea (1.7% vs 1.1%). 
A comparable number of SAEs were observed in the nivolumab and placebo arm (29.6% vs 30.2%). 
The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs in the nivolumab arm were urinary tract infection 
(2.6% vs 6.0%), malignant neoplasm progression (2.3% vs 5.5%), intestinal obstruction (1.4% vs 
1.4%), acute kidney injury (1.4% vs 0.3%). 
There were 2 deaths due to study drug toxicity in the nivolumab arm (one immune-mediated 
pneumonitis and one pneumonitis).  
The number of discontinuation due to AEs was higher in the nivolumab arm compared to the 
placebo arm (18.2% vs 9.2% respectively). 
AEs with potential immune-related aetiology occurred more frequently in the nivolumab arm. The 
majority of these AEs were low Grade and most AEs resolved with dose delays and/or immune 
modulating medication. An exception were endocrine select AEs, in this category most AEs were not 
considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy. 
Posology 
To support the 480 mg Q4W dosing regimen, the predicted 6 month and 1 year probabilities of Gr2+ 
IMAE were approximately 6% and 8%, respectively, higher for the nivolumab 480 mg Q4W compared 
to nivolumab 240 mg Q2W for adjuvant muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. The small differences in 
probability in Grade 2+ IMAEs for 480 mg Q4W compared to 240 mg Q2W, based on Cmax1 as 
predictor as worst case scenario, are similar to those predicted for other indications and were found 
acceptable for melanoma and RCC indications. Therefore, the 480 mg Q4W dosing regimen can be 
accepted. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no new safety concerns identified and no major uncertainties were identified with regard to 
the safety results.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The reported DFS results in study CA209274 showed an advantage for nivolumab compared to placebo 
in the PD-L1≥ 1% population for the dual primary endpoint. This effect is sustained over time as 
showed by the clear separation of the KM curves which appears to reach a plateau from 30 months 
onwards indicative of long-term benefit.  Secondary endpoints such as DMFS and PFS2 for which the 
KM curves also indicate sustained effects and plateaus provide further support for a benefit of 
nivolumab in PD-L1≥ 1% patients.   
OS data are still immature. Even if this constitutes a limitation in the context of an adjuvant treatment 
a detrimental effect on OS is considered unlikely for the reasons aforementioned and the provided 
updated DFS results (effect size and duration) and additional analyses (secondary endpoints) are 
considered sufficient to support clinical benefit in the intended treatment setting.  
The MAH will provide the results of the planned 2nd IA and the final OS analysis to further characterize 
the efficacy of nivolumab in subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1% by December 2027 
(see Annex II). 
There are no new safety concerns and no major uncertainties related to safety identified. The toxicity 
and tolerability of treatment with adjuvant nivolumab is somewhat worse compared to placebo as 
shown by the higher number of severe AEs, dose delays and discontinuations due to AEs, but appears 
manageable and could be acceptable in light of an effective therapy.  
Complexities in the eCRF and a suboptimal trial oversight/data management led to a small number of 
errors in the DFS data, which were corrected during this procedure. The data are considered 
sufficiently reliable for assessment.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Nivolumab has demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in DFS in 
adults with MIUC with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, who are at high risk of recurrence after 
undergoing radical resection of MIUC, supported by updated analysis and secondary endpoints.  Even 
though there are currently uncertainties on the magnitude of the benefit in terms of OS, the results are

considered clinically relevant and sufficient to conclude on (long-term) clinical benefit in the intended 
treatment setting. 
The safety data from study CA209274 are consistent with the already known safety profile of 
nivolumab and no new risks have been identified.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of nivolumab as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adults with muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIUC) with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, who are at high 
risk of recurrence after undergoing radical resection of MIUC is positive.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy of nivolumab as 
adjuvant treatment of adult patients with muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma the MAH should submit 
the OS data from the 2nd IA and the final OS analysis of the phase 3 CA209274 study for the PD-L1 
≥1% population.

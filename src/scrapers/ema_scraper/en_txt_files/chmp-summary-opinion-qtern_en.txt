Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Qtern 
saxagliptin / dapagliflozin 
On 26 May 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Qtern, 
intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The applicant for this medicinal product is 
AstraZeneca AB. 
Qtern is a fixed-dose combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin, two oral blood glucose lowering 
medicines (ATC code: A10BD21). It will be available as film-coated tablets (containing 5 mg saxagliptin 
and 10 mg dapagliflozin). Saxagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibition 
reduces the cleavage and inactivation of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), leading to 
an increase in incretin levels, which in turn stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibits 
the release of glucagon. Dapagliflozin is a competitive, reversible, selective and orally active inhibitor of 
the human sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) which reduces renal glucose re-absorption leading 
to urinary glucose excretion. 
The benefit with Qtern is its ability to lower blood glucose. The most common side effect is upper 
respiratory tract infection. When used with a sulphonylurea hypoglycaemia may occur. 
The full indication is:  
“Qtern, fixed dose combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin, is indicated in adults aged 18 years and 
older with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
- 
to improve glycaemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea (SU) and one of the 
monocomponents of Qtern do not provide adequate glycaemic control,  
-  when already being treated with the free combination of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin. 
(See sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on combinations studied.)” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 days from 
adoption of the opinion

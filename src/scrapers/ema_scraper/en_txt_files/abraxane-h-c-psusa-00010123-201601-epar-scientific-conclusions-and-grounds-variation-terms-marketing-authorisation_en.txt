Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for paclitaxel albumin, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Drug interaction regarding CYP2C8: 
Paclitaxel is metabolised by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Inhibition of these enzymes may lead to increased 
exposure of paclitaxel and hence increased toxicity of paclitaxel. It was only recently that the 
strong, time-dependent CYP2C8-inhibiting effects of clopidogrel’s metabolite clopidogrel acyl-β-D-
glucuronide, in humans were found. During the current PSUR review period. The first description of 
the clinical relevance of the interaction between paclitaxel and clopidogrel has been published by 
Bergmann et al. (Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2016), and in addition, this interaction has also been 
described in an article by Shinoda et al., Biomed Tep 2016. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that 
changes to the product information of medicinal products containing paclitaxel albumin were 
warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for paclitaxel albumin the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing paclitaxel albumin is unchanged subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

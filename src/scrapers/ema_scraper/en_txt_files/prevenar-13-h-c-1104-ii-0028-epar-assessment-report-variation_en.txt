3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Vaccines against pneumococcal disease have a successful public health impact and the development of 
safe, effective vaccines that offer broad protection against pneumococcal disease is considered by the 
WHO as a high priority. Due to the unmet medical need for extended valency vaccines beyond the 7 
serotypes in Prevenar, the 13 serotypes in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7 Prevenar 
types + 6 additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 7F. 6A, 7F, 19A)) have further expanded coverage and in 
Europe cover 80% or more of IPD cases in children less than 5 years of age, as documented by 
surveillance studies performed before the introduction of 7-valent Prevenar. 
Prevenar 13 is currently indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, 
pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants and children from 6 
weeks to 5 years of age.  
There is a need for an effective vaccine to prevent pneumococcal disease (PD) in adults beginning at 
50 years of age, coincident with the increase in PD seen in the general population starting at this age. 
The available free-polysaccharide vaccine (PS), 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(23vPS), has demonstrated efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD); albeit the duration 
of protection is limited and the efficacy of 23vPS against community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is 
uncertain. Although the incidence of IPD and related deaths have declined in adults in recent years, 
because of herd immunity effects resulting from the licensure of Prevenar (7-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine, 7vPnC), the IPD death rates in adults over 50 years of age are 10- to 27-fold higher 
than in children less than 2 years of age. 
In contrast, conjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PnCs) have been proven effective 
against IPD and pneumonia in children in developed and developing countries.  In addition, clinical 
studies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adult populations have provided evidence that 
conjugated vaccines exhibit noted efficacy against IPD and possibly pneumonia, in circumstances 
where 23vPS has not afforded such protection to these immune-compromised adults. Findings support 
the perspective that conjugate vaccine is likely to protect against IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in 
the relatively less compromised elderly adult population. 
PnCs elicit immune responses that are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from those elicited by PS. 
Nonetheless, the best measurable immune response associated with the efficacy of pneumococcal 
vaccines is antibody-mediated opsonophagocytic activity (OPA). 
13vPnC is currently licensed for use in infants and children, and it elicits functional OPA antibodies 
against 13 pneumococcal serotypes most associated with severe PD in adults. 
The clinical development program in adults aged 50 years and older comprised safety and 
immunogenicity data from eight Prevenar 13 (13vPnC) clinical trials and 1 precursor Prevenar (7vPnC) 
clinical trial. The clinical program investigated the use of 13vPnC in adults aged 50 years and over and 
in 2 target groups with the following age stratifications: 
1. 
Individuals naive to 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS) aged: 
  ≥65 years  
  60-64 years 
  50-59 years 
2. 
Individuals pre-immunized with 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS) at least 5 years prior 
to study enrolment aged: 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 4/86
 
 
 
 
 
 
  ≥70 years 
Each trial included healthy adults and immuno-competent subjects with stable underlying conditions 
known to pre-dispose adults to an increased risk of pneumococcal disease, such as chronic 
cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease (including asthma), renal disorders, diabetes 
mellitus, and chronic liver disease including alcoholic liver disease.  Adults who smoked and used 
alcohol were included in all studies. 
The MAH’s proposed adult clinical program was conducted in line with the CHMP Follow-up Scientific 
Advice obtained in 2006 (EMEA/H/SA/690/1/FU/1/2006/II), which stated that a positive outcome 
based on functional OPA immunogenicity responses would be sufficient for approval of 13vPnC in 
adults over the age of 50. In accord with Scientific Advice, the 13vPnC data support coverage of the 
pneumococcal serotypes most responsible for serious adult disease, the potential for reimmunization 
with 13vPnC to extend protection without blunting of immune response as seen with 23vPS, and the 
importance of administering 13vPnC as the first pneumococcal vaccine to provide protection.  
The MAH initial proposed indication was: 
Active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults aged 
50 years and older. 
After two rounds of assessment, including an ad hoc expert meeting to address whether OPA titres are 
appropriate to bridge efficacy from 23vPS vaccines to 13vPnC, the CHMP concluded that the benefit-
risk balance of Prevenar 13 for prevention of invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae is positive.  
The evaluation procedure started as a Type II variation to add a new therapeutic indication.

Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA 
decision (P/34/2008) for the following condition(s): 
  Pneumococcal disease 
On the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) 
The PIP is not yet completed 
3.2.  Toxico-pharmacological 
Since the proposed indication of 13vPnC is intended for use in adults, a reproductive and 
developmental toxicity study was conducted in rabbits. 
Female New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were immunized with 13vPnC prior to mating and every 2 
weeks thereafter through gestation day (GD) 24 to ensure that anti-13vPnC antibodies were present 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 5/86
 
 
 
 
throughout gestation. Anti-13vPnC antibodies against each of the serotypes was detected in the does 
on gestation day GD29 confirming that the does responded and anti-13vPnC antibodies were shown to 
be able to cross the placenta based on the fact that they were also detected in the first filial (F1) 
fetuses on GD 29 and in the F1 pups on post-partum day (PPD) 21.The results of this study indicate 
that repeated immunization of female rabbits resulted in the generation of anti-13vPnC antibodies, that 
the fetuses and F1 pups were exposed to the anti-13vPnC antibodies, and that there were no effects of 
immunization with 13vPnC on female fertility, or embryo/fetal or post-natal development.  
No formal assessment of male fertility was conducted; however, there were no 13vPnC-related effects 
on male reproductive organs in any of the nonclinical studies conducted in rabbits as well as in other 
species.  
These data support the conclusion that immunization with 13vPnC has no effect on reproduction. 
3.3.  Clinical aspects 
3.3.1.  Background 
Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adults, particularly in 
the elderly and in high risk populations. In persons aged 65 years and older, the annual incidence of 
invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in industrialized countries ranges from 24 to 85 cases per 
100,000 of the total population. In 2008, approximately 44,000 cases and 4,500 deaths from IPD 
(bacteremia and meningitis) were estimated to have occurred in the United States and more than half 
of these cases were in elderly or immunocompromised adults. 
Pneumococcal disease can be classified by clinical presentation (invasive or non-invasive) and by risk 
factors (age, living conditions, and underlying medical conditions). In adults, the clinical presentations 
of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) include meningitis, bacteraemia, and bacteremic pneumonia. 
IPD is defined by isolation of pneumococcus from a normally sterile site such as cerebrospinal fluid or 
blood, as well as pleural fluid or peritoneal fluid. Pneumonia without bacteraemia is the most common 
serious manifestation of non-invasive pneumococcal disease. 
Important risk factors for pneumococcal disease include age and underlying medical conditions. In 
particular, adults older than 65 years (eg, 65 to 75 years, or >75 years) and increasingly, adults 
between 50 and 65 years (eg, 50 to 59 years, 60 to 64 years) are recognized to be at increased risk. 
Additional risk factors for serious pneumococcal disease include living circumstances and underlying 
medical conditions. Living conditions can increase the individual risk of pneumococcal disease, 
particularly residence in a nursing home or other long-term care facility. 
The incidence of IPD is greatest at the extremes of life, creating a classic U-shaped curve of age versus 
incidence. Figure 1 shows an example from England and Wales, in which an adult 23vPS campaign was 
initiated in 2003, and 7vPnC was introduced into the national immunization program in 2006.

Figure 1.  Invasive Pneumococcal Disease Incidence per 100,000 Population by Age                
Grouping in England and Wales From 2000 to 2009 (Courtesy of the Health Protection Agency, UK) 
The total burden of disease (number of cases) within a population depends both on the size of each 
age group and on the proportion of individuals within the age group who have a risk factor of disease. 
In the United Kingdom, for example, for each child below the age of 5 years, there are about 2 adults 
above the age of 65 years. Nonetheless, for 2009/2010 in England and Wales (Health Protection 
Agency surveillance), there were about 5 times as many laboratory confirmed cases of IPD in adults 
older than 65 years as in children aged less than 5 years (respectively, 1,937 and 388 cases). 
Consequently, the burden of IPD in older adults is much greater than the sizes of the 2 populations 
(adults >65 years of age compared to young children <5 years of age) would suggest. 
In addition to the disease burden in older adults, the case-fatality rate from IPD among hospitalized 
patients remains important. In spite of advances in medical science over the last decades, the case-
fatality rate (12% to 13% in the USA, for instance) has remained constant through the 1950s to the 
present.  
Medical Need for improved Pneumococcal vaccines for adults 
As reviewed by Fedson and Musher, Jackson and Neuzil, and Makela and Butler, a number of studies 
have supported the value of purified free-polysaccharide vaccine (different serotype formulations) in 
protecting adults against IPD and have estimated the efficacy against IPD caused by vaccine serotypes 
to be around 50% with an overall effectiveness of around 75%. However, some trials have failed to 
demonstrate statistically significant efficacy against IPD in elderly adults. Antibody levels and 
protection against IPD appear to wane over a period of 3 to 5 years. 23vPS efficacy and effectiveness 
are limited in individuals with co-morbidities or risk factors, as compared to healthy adults.  
Introduction of infant and childhood 7vPnC immunization has resulted in a decrease in IPD in infants 
and toddlers and an indirect decrease in IPD in adults, which is presumed to be due to reduction of 
vaccine serotype pneumococcal colonization in infants and lower likelihood of transmission to 
susceptible adults, referred to as indirect (herd) protection. In spite of this indirect protection, the gap 
in protection of adults in comparison to infants has widened. In 2008, the mortality rate among adults 
50 to 64 years of age (2.21/100,000) was more than 2-fold greater than the mortality rate among 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 7/86
 
 
 
 
 
 
infants >1 year of age, and the mortality rate among adults ≥65 years of age (6.35/100,000) was 
more than 6-fold greater than rates in infants <1 year of age. 
In the United States, despite the impact of pediatric 7vPnC in reducing IPD in all age groups by indirect 
protection, there are 44,000 IPD cases and 4500 deaths each year; approximately 24,000 to 26,000 of 
the IPD cases and 3600 of the deaths occur annually in adults over 50 years of age. 
Data from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in the UK affords an additional opportuni
ty to evaluate 
the effect of a comprehensive 23vPS immunization campaign that began in 2003 in older adults, and a
7vPnC infant and childhood national immunization program, which began in 2006. Immunization of 
adults with 23vPS was encouraged, so that by 2007 rates were 70.1% in 65- to 74-year-olds, 77.3%
in 75- to 79-year-olds, and 75.8% in subjects 80 years of age and older. Despite this national 
comprehensive campaign that more than doubled previous immunization levels, 23vPS did not 
reduce 
rates of IPD in adults ≥65 years of age by 2009 (Figure 1).  
The efficacy of 23vPS against community-acquired pneu
monia (CAP) is uncertain. 
Widespread use of 23vPS has not impacted overall CAP pneumonia rates, and by inference from fa
ilure 
to reduce IPD rates, has not reduced pneumococcal CAP. No or limited effectiveness of the 23vPS 
vaccine has been demonstrated in observational studies. In contrast to indirect reductions of IPD, 
including bacteremic pneumonia, broad pediatric 7vPnC vaccination has not yet demonstrated 
convincing evidence of an indirect reduction of cases of CAP (pneumococcal or all cause), partic
ularly 
in older adults. 
Indirect protection from 7vPnC programs 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Preventi
on (CDC) has performed a comprehensive assessment 
of IPD burden beginning in 1997 prior to the introduction of 7vPnC, through introduction of a 7vPnC 
paediatric national immunization program (NIP) in 2000 that continues to the present.  
Importantly, an indirect (herd) protection effect of childhood 7vPnC immunization has not 
been 
universally observed. Rates of adult IPD in some countries, such as Denmark, Germany, or the U
K, 
have remained relatively unchanged over the past 5 years and rates in Spain have decreased, but no
t 
yet to the degree seen in the USA.   
In contrast to indirect reductions of IP
D, including bacteremic pneumonia, broad paediatric 7vPnC 
vaccination has not yet demonstrated convincing evidence of an indirect reduction of cases of CAP 
(pneumococcal or all cause), particularly in older adults. No reductions were seen in either outpatie
nt 
or inpatient settings from these studies. 
Serotype coverage of the 13vPnC and 23vPS vaccines 
13vPnC Serotypes Responsible for Adult Invasive Pneumococcal Disease 
The serotype-specific epidemiology of adult IPD has been studied based on isolates from otherwi
se 
sterile sites of patients suffering from pneumococcal diseases such as meningitis, bacteraemia, or 
bacteremic pneumonia. 
In the USA, the distributi
on of IPD serotypes in adults >65 years of age can be compared, from 1998-
1999 (pre-7vPnC) to 2006-2007 (post-7vPnC, Table 1). The 13vPnC coverage fell from 75.5% to 
49.9%, which can be attributed to the indirect (herd) effect of the childhood NIP for 7vPnC that be
gan 
in 2000-2001. The most prevalent serotypes in 2006-2007 (each having a frequency greater than 7%) 
were 19A, 6A, 3, 7F, and 22F. 
CHMP variation assessment report

Table 1.  Serotype Distribution (%) in Invasive Pneumococcal Disease and Coverage of 13vPnC in 
Adults, USA (Pilishvili et al 2010) 
In England and Wales, unpublished surveillance data from the UK HPA reveal the effect of a targeted 
23vPS program (2003 to 2006) in elderly adults and the impact of the 7vPnC NIP that began in 2006 
(Table 3). In the first period, there was little change in the proportion of isolates covered by 23vPS 
(from 88.8% in 2002 to 2003 to 87.8% in 2005 to 2006). This absence of impact was equally noted 
among the 13 serotypes in 13vPnC (from 72.5% in 2002-03 to 74.0% in 2005-06) and the 11 
serotypes unique to 23vPS (from 20.4% in 2002-03 to 18.5% in 2005-06). The contrast is striking 
once 7vPnC was introduced into the NIP in 2006, as there was an important change in the proportion 
of serotypes associated with 13vPnC (from 74.0% in 2005-06 to 52.6% in 2009-2010), among the 
most prevalent remaining serotypes being 19A, 3, 22F, and 7F. By contrast, the proportion of 
serotypes unique to 23vPS rose (from 18.5% in 2005-06 to 29.2% in 2009-2010).

In addition to the experience in the USA and the UK (pre-7vPnC and post-7vPnC), there are pre-7vPnC 
NIP surveillance data from Germany and the Czech Republic. In a report from North-Rhine Westphalia, 
Germany (2001-2003), 647 invasive isolates of S pneumoniae were serotyped, with 9 of the top 10 
isolates being represented in the 13vPnC formulation; these 10 isolates in order of prevalence were 
serotypes 14, 3, 4, 7F, 23F, 1, 9V, 6A, 8, and 19F. Subsequent, nation-wide German surveillance was 
provided through 2008. Over the period from 2003 to 2008, the 13vPnC serotype coverage (adults 
>16 years of age) ranged from 71.3% to 77.3%, while the proportion of serotypes unique to 23vPS 
ranged from 13.3% to 18.4%. In the Czech Republic, over the period from 1997 to 2006, the 13vPnC 
serotype coverage (adults >65 years of age) was 65.0%, while the proportion of serotypes unique to 
23vPS was 25.4%. 
In summary, various studies have aimed at ranking the risk for severe disease or death for different 
pneumococcal serotypes. In most of these studies several of the serotypes associated with high risk for 
hospitalization or mortality are included in Prevenar 13 vaccine. These strains are also included in the 
23vPS vaccine, and do not indicate an advantage of 13vPnC over 23vPS vaccine.  
3.3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program investigated the use of 13vPnC in adults over 50 years of age in 2 
target groups with the following age stratifications: 
1. 
Individuals naive to 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS) aged: 
  ≥65 years  
  60-64 years 
  50-59 years 
2. 
Individuals pre-immunized with 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS) at least 5 years prior 
to study enrolment aged: 
  ≥70 years 
The efficacy data include immunogenicity results from seven 13vPnC trials and one precursor 7vPnC 
trial in adults (see details below). 
Main studies: Pivotal Non-inferiority trials (studies 004 and 3005) 
The dossier included 2 pivotal non inferiority trials: one in subjects aged 50 to 64 years (study 004) 
who were naïve to 23vPS, and the other trial in subjects aged 70 years or older who had previously 
received 1 dose of 23vPS (study 3005) at least 5 years earlier.  
Pivotal Non-inferiority Trial in a Naïve Population (Study 004) 
Study 004 is the pivotal study to support licensure of 13vPnC in adults aged 50 to 64 years who were 
naïve to polysaccharide vaccination. This study was conducted at multiple sites in the United States. A 
primary trial objective was to demonstrate that a single dose of 13vPnC is non-inferior to a single dose 
of 23vPS in the age cohort of 60 to 64 years, as measured by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic 
activity (OPA) titers for the 12 serotypes common to both vaccines. A co-primary objective was to 
demonstrate that the proportion of subjects exhibiting a 4-fold increase in anti-6A OPA titer was 
statistically significantly greater in subjects receiving 13vPnC than in those receiving 23vPS. A 
secondary objective was to demonstrate that 13vPnC elicits statistically significantly greater immune 
responses relative to 23vPS for some serotypes. 
In a younger age cohort of 50 to 59 years, subjects received 13vPnC only, and non-inferiority of the 
immune response in this age group was assessed relative to the immune response in the older cohort. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 10/86
 
 
 
 
Pivotal Non-inferiority Trial in a Pre-immunized Population (Study 3005) 
Study 3005 is the pivotal non-inferiority trial to support licensure in 23vPS pre-immunized subjects. 
This study was conducted at multiple sites in Sweden and the United States in subjects aged 70 years 
or older who had received a dose of 23vPS at least 5 years earlier (ie at the recommended age of 65). 
Subjects in study 3005 received the first vaccination with either 13vPnC or 23vPS. One year after the 
initial vaccination both groups received another vaccination with 13vPnC. 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that 13vPnC elicits serotype-specific OPA 
responses that are non-inferior to those induced by 23vPS in pre-immunized subjects. A co-primary 
objective was to demonstrate that the proportion of subjects exhibiting a 4-fold increase in anti-6A 
OPA titer was statistically significantly greater in subjects receiving 13vPnC than in those receiving 
23vPS. A secondary objective was to show that OPA responses to 13vPnC were statistically significantly 
greater than responses to 23vPS for some common serotypes. 
The study also assessed the immune response of a second dose of 13vPnC. Data from pre-immunized 
subjects who received 13vPnC one year after 23vPS were evaluated to determine whether 13vPnC 
would increase immune response following 2 doses of 23vPS. 
Subsequent Dose Trial (Study 3010) 
Study 3010 was conducted in 23vPS naïve subjects, aged 60 to 64 years, at multiple sites in the 
United States. The purpose of the study was to assess the ability of subjects to respond to 13vPnC and 
23vPS when given a year apart in differing sequential order. The study was also designed to assess 
response after 2 doses of 13vPnC, each vaccination given a year apart. The primary objective of this 
study was to assess non inferiority of OPA response to 23vPS administered 1 year after an initial study 
dose of 13vPnC (i.e. 13vPnC/23vPS) relative to OPA response after an initial study dose of 23vPS for 
the 12 serotypes common to both 13vPnC and 23vPS. A co-primary objective was to assess non 
inferiority of immune response to 23vPS administered 1 year after an initial study dose of 13vPnC (ie, 
13vPnC/23vPS) relative to OPA response to 13vPnC administered 1 year after an initial study dose of 
23vPS (ie, 23vPS/13vPnC) for the 12 common serotypes. Subjects in group 1 received an initial 
vaccination with 13vPnC followed by either another vaccination with 13vPnC or 23vPS one year later. 
Subjects in group 2 received an initial vaccination with 23vPS and, 1 year later, another vaccination 
with 13vPnC. 
Trials of 13vPnC Compatibility With Influenza Vaccine (Studies 3001 and 3008) 
Most countries in Europe recommend vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine in adults aged 65 
years and older. In the US the influenza vaccine is recommended for adults aged 50 years and older. 
Clinicians often administer the pneumococcal vaccine at the same time as the influenza vaccine in this 
population, to limit the number of healthcare visits; administration of both vaccines may also be 
beneficial because of the high risk of bacterial coinfection in the elderly. For these reasons, the 
compatibility of 13vPnC given concomitantly with the seasonal influenza vaccine was evaluated. 
Studies 3001 and 3008 were conducted at multiple sites in the United States and Europe (Belgium, 
Germany, Hungary, and the Netherlands), respectively. In study 3001 subjects were aged 50 to 59 
years and in study 3008 subjects were aged 65 years or older. In both studies subjects were naïve to 
23vPS. One co-primary objective of each study was to evaluate non inferiority of immune response to 
the influenza antigens contained in TIV after administration of 13vPnC + TIV relative to that after TIV 
alone (ie, 13vPnC+TIV versus placebo+TIV), as measured by the standard hemagglutination inhibition 
assay (HAI) for the A/H1, A/H3, and B vaccine strains. Another co-primary objective of each study was 
to evaluate the non inferiority of pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG response to the combined 
administration of 13vPnC and TIV relative to that of 13vPnC alone (ie, 13vPnC+TIV versus 13vPnC), as 
measured by serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations.

Over 1000 subjects were enrolled in each study and randomly assigned to 2 groups: one group 
received 13vPnC and TIV (Fluarix™), followed by placebo (13vPnC+TIV/placebo); the other group 
received placebo and TIV followed by 13vPnC (placebo+TIV/13vPnC) one month later. The data from 
both studies demonstrate compatibility of the two vaccines. 
Study 3001 has a 5-year follow up with yearly bleeds and revaccination with 13vPnC at year 5; these 
data were not included in the dossier. 
Supportive Studies (Studies 500 and 3009) 
Two trials included in the dossier did not use the final commercial formulation of13vPnC; these were 
study 500 and study 3009, a follow up trial to study 500. Both studies are considered supportive 
studies. 
Formulation Choice and Non inferiority Trial (Study 500) 
Study 500 was conducted at multiple sites in South Africa in subjects aged 65 years and older who 
were naïve to previous 23vPS. The study was designed as a formulation choice trial and as a non 
inferiority study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 vaccine groups: group 1 received 13vPnC 
with aluminium phosphate (13vPnC+AlPO4); group 2 received 13vPnC without AlPO4 (13vPnC-AlPO4); 
and group 3 received 23vPS. A year after the initial vaccination subjects who received the selected 
13vPnC formulation were to receive either a subsequent dose of 23vPSor a second dose of the selected 
13vPnC formulation. 
Formulation choice: The formulation of Prevenar includes aluminium phosphate (AlPO4), which 
evidence suggests may enhance immune response in infants. Thus, AlPO4 is also a component of the 
13vPnC formulation licensed for use in infants. To determine whether AlPO4 should be included in the 
final 13vPnC formulation for use in adults, study 500 evaluated the non inferiority of IgG response 
induced by 13vPnC with AlPO4 (13vPnC+AlPO4 ) relative to 13vPnC without AlPO4 (13vPnC-AlPO4), ie, 
the first co-primary objective. Based on the results of an interim analysis and logistical considerations 
to supply the same vaccine for infants and adults, the 13vPnC formulation with AlPO4 was selected for 
use in the 13vPnC adult program. 
Non-inferiority: To address the other co-primary objective, the study assessed non-inferiority of 
immune response to the selected 13vPnC formulation relative to 23vPS, which is licensed for use in 
adults aged 65 years and older and in high risk groups. This analysis was based on serotype-specific 
OPA responses in subjects who received a single dose of 13vPnC or 23vPS. 
The study was also designed to assess the immune responses of subsequent doses of 13vPnC or 23vPS 
given 1 year after an initial dose of 13vPnC. 
South African Follow up Trial (Study 3009) 
Study 3009 was a continuation of study 500 and used the selected 13vPnC formulation from study 500. 
Subjects who received 13vPnC as an initial vaccination and 23vPS one year later (ie, 13vPnC/23vPS) in 
study 500 were included in study 3009; these subjects received another dose of 13vPnC one year after 
the 23vPS dose in study 500. The primary objective of this study was to compare immune response 
after receipt of the subsequent 13vPnC dose in study 3009 relative to that after 13vPnC given as a first 
dose in study 500 (ie, 13vPnC/23vPS/13vPnC versus 13vPnC). This study was of interest because 
previous experience showed that when 23vPS is given as the initial vaccine, the immune response to a 
subsequent dose of pneumococcal vaccine may be diminished. 
Study 3009 was conducted to determine whether priming with 13vPnC before 23vPS (ie, 
13vPnC/23vPS in study 500) overcomes the potential decline of antibodies caused by 23vPS to a 
subsequent dose of 13vPnC (ie [13vPnC/23vPS]/13vPnC in study 3009).

3.3.3.  Statistical Methods 
Studies 004, 500, 3005, and, 3010 had non-inferiority objectives and were powered to assess non-
inferiority of immune response to pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, studies 3001 and 3008 were 
also powered to assess non-inferiority of immune response to the pneumococcal serotypes and to the 
influenza strains in TIV, when 13vPnC was given with the concomitant influenza vaccine. 
Immunogenicity data were based on results of assays performed using blood samples obtained at 
protocol-specified time points. 
Assay values were reported in the database as provided by the testing laboratories. Missing values 
were excluded from the immunogenicity analyses; no imputation or estimation of missing values was 
performed. 
Analysis Populations 
In each study, an evaluable immunogenicity population and an all-available immunogenicity population 
were defined for the analyses. In all studies, the primary analysis population was the evaluable 
immunogenicity population. Within these broad categories, additional analysis populations have been 
created for the evaluation of vaccination 1 or vaccination 2.  
Comparisons of Interest and Endpoints 
The primary immunogenicity endpoint for pneumococcal response was the serotype-specific OPA titers 
measured 1 month after each vaccination. The immunologic comparisons for pneumococcal response 
varied according to the individual study. In the non-inferiority studies (studies 004, 3005, and 500) a 
primary comparison of interest was OPA response to 13vPnC relative to 23vPS. In studies with primary 
objectives that required assessment of sequential use (studies 3010, 3009) OPA titers elicited by 1 
vaccine sequence or dose relative to another were compared. 
In the concomitant influenza vaccine studies the primary pneumococcal endpoint was the serotype-
specific anticapsular IgG concentrations, and the primary influenza endpoints was the proportions of 
subjects (responders) who achieved at least a 4-fold increase (ie, seroconverters) in HAI titers elicited 
by the 3 strains in TIV (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B). The comparisons of interest in these 2 studies were 
the serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) after 13vPnC + TIV 
relative to 13vPnC and the proportions of responders to the 3 strains in TIV in subjects receiving 
13vPnC + TIV relative to TIV + placebo. 
Pneumococcal Antibody Titers and Concentrations 
Geometric Means 
Within each vaccine group and for each serotype, OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) or IgG GMCs 
were calculated. Each titer or concentration was logarithmically transformed for analysis. Two (2)-sided 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the mean of the 
logarithmically transformed assay results computed using the Student t distribution. Fold rises in 
antibody concentrations from before to after each vaccination, or from vaccination 1 to vaccination 2 
(for purposes of comparing vaccination 2 to vaccination 1 within a vaccine sequence) were summarized 
by geometric means and 95% CIs, and were also computed using the logarithmically transformed 
assay results; for within-group comparisons each subject was their own control. 
To assess differences between the 2 vaccine groups, 2-sided 95% CIs for the ratio of OPA GMTs or IgG 
GMCs (test to reference) were constructed. In studies 004 and 3005 and 500, non-inferiority of 
13vPnC relative to 23vPS (and of cohort 2 relative to cohort 1 in study 004), or non-inferiority of 1 
vaccine sequence or dose to another (3010, 3005, 500), was declared if the lower limit of the CI for 
the ratio was greater than 0.5 (2-fold criterion). 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 13/86
 
 
 
 
Statistical significance was defined for OPA GMT or IgG GMC comparisons as a lower limit of the 95% 
CI for the ratio (test to reference) of >1 (statistically significantly higher) or the upper limit of the 95% 
CI for the ratio of <1 (statistically significantly lower). 
Comparisons involving serotype 6A were the topic of specific regulatory consultation, as serotype 6A is 
not included in 23vPS. In the pivotal non-inferiority studies 004 and 3005, statistically significantly 
greater response to 13vPnC was demonstrated for serotype 6A if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the 
geometric mean ratio (13vPnC GMT/ 23vPS GMT) was >2.0. 
Rationale for Non-inferiority Criterion for Comparison of OPA GMTs 
The non-inferiority criterion for application in the adult 13vPnC program was chosen after regulatory 
consultation and was based upon relevant publications at the time of study design. 
Additional justification is provided as follows: 
Study 6097A1-508 evaluated administration of 7vPnC compared to 23vPS in pneumococcal vaccine-
naive adults ≥70 years of age. Based on observed GMT OPA data in study 6097A1-508, it was found 
that, the conservative estimate (lower 95% bound) for the 23vPS treatment effect relative to placebo 
(estimated using baseline data from all treatment groups) is in the range 4.08 to 30.38 across the 
serotypes studied (Table 3). It is assumed that placebo would behave similarly to the observed 
baseline data.

From these findings, it may be inferred that the non-inferiority bound (0.5), applied in the 13vPnC 
adult program non-inferiority studies for 13vPnC testing to 23vPS, preserves between 88% to 99% of 
the control effect and therefore is conservative for non-inferiority trials. 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving Defined Levels 
The proportion of subjects achieving or exceeding an OPA titer prespecified as the lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ) for each serotype in each vaccine group (ie, responders) was assessed in studies 
004, 3005, and 500 (and as ad hoc comparisons in studies 3010 and 3005). In addition, exact, 
unconditional, 2-sided, 95% CIs on the proportion were calculated using Clopper and Pearson. 
To assess vaccine differences, exact, unconditional, 2-sided 95% CIs for the difference in proportions 
of responders between vaccine groups were calculated. The CIs for the difference in proportions were 
computed by the non-inferiority procedure of Chan and Zhang. Non-inferiority was declared if the 
difference in proportion of responders (test – reference) at the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater 
than -10%. The rationale for use of this criterion is provided in Horne et al. 
The same method was used to compare the proportion of responders achieving a 4-fold rise in 
antibody titer or an OPA titer of 1:8. 
Statistical significance was defined for comparison of the proportion of responders as a lower limit of 
the 95% CI for the difference (test - reference) of >0 (statistically significantly higher) or the upper 
limit of the 95% CI for the difference of <0 (statistically significantly lower). 
Antigens in the Concomitant Vaccine TIV 
The primary endpoint for the TIV comparisons in study 3001 and 3008 was the proportion of subjects 
who achieved at least a 4-fold increase in the HAI titer, ie, the definition of seroconversion, for each 
influenza strain (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B) 1 month after vaccination with TIV. The same statistical 
methods as used in pneumococcal non-inferiority analyses for calculating exact, unconditional, 2-sided 
95% CIs for the proportion of responders and for the difference in proportions (13vPnC + TIV – 
placebo + TIV) were used for the TIV antigens. For each antigen, non-inferiority was declared if the 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in the proportion of responders was greater than 
-0.10. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 15/86
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Geometric Means 
Within each vaccine group and for each antigen separately, the geometric means of the TIV antibody 
titers measured 1 month after vaccine administration were calculated. The same statistical methods for 
computing GMTs and corresponding 95% CIs as those described for the pneumococcal serotypes were 
used for the TIV antigens, although these studies were not designed to show non-inferiorty of TIV + 
13vPnC relative to TIV + placebo based on GMTs. 
Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves 
The empirical reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) were presented graphically for serotype-
specific OPA titers, and IgG concentrations when assessed. These graphs show (not included herein) 
the distribution of OPA or IgG responses 1 month after each vaccination. 
Analyses in High-Risk Groups 
Various categories of high risk were identified across the studies in the filing, and OPA GMTs or IgG 
GMCs in these subgroups were computed. (Immunocompetent high-risk subjects with stable disease 
were not excluded from participating in the study.) No statistical comparisons between vaccine groups 
were presented; only descriptive analyses of immunogenicity results were provided. Subjects may 
have had more than 1 condition identified as high risk and thus may have been included in more than 
1 high-risk group. 
Measurements of Immune Response 
Description of the Modified OPA Assay Used in the Serological Analysis of 13vPnC Adult Program 
The OPA assay measures functional antibodies to Streptococcus pneumoniae. OPA assays have been 
used to measure the functional antibody activity elicited by 13vPnC in the infant program, and results 
were central to licensure of the 13vPnC paediatric indications. These assays used the “traditional” 
method of manually dribbling the final assay samples onto growth medium for viable bacterial colony 
formation and enumeration. The assays are labor-intensive and limited in their ability to handle the 
high throughput clinical testing required in support of the 13vPnC phase 3 trials in adults. Hence, the 
assay was modified by simplification of some of the assay steps and by introduction of automation. 
This modified assay, termed microcolony OPA (mcOPA), has been developed to increase throughput 
and robustness in order to be able to analyze the large number of serological samples. The 
microcolony, or “mc” designation, refers to the use of bacterial microcolonies for the enumeration of 
viable bacterial cells. However, the mcOPA assay uses the same killing endpoint of 50% as the dOPA 
assay. As part of the assessment of the mcOPA assay, samples from the infant phase 3 study 6096A1-
006 were tested using the assay and a statistical assessment of mcOPA and dOPA assay results was 
performed. This assessment found significant concordance between the findings of both assays, 
supporting the perspective that the use of the mcOPA will not confound statistical inference in future 
studies of pneumococcal vaccines.  
The serotype-specific OPA assays do not use an external reference standard, and therefore OPA titers 
cannot be compared across serotypes. An OPA titer is defined as the interpolated reciprocal serum 
dilution that results in complement mediated killing of 50% of the bacteria in each OPA assay. The 
lowest titer that can be determined in OPA assays is a titer of 1:8 (limit of detection, LOD) and is the 
same for each serotype-specific OPA assay. However, to quantify functional antibodies in the OPA 
assays with appropriate precision and accuracy, the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was determined 
for each serotype-specific OPA assay during assay validation. The LLOQ for each serotype-specific OPA 
assay was used as a cut-off to determine serum response for the immunogenicity subjects. Previously, 
an OPA serum response was determined using an OPA titer cut-off of 1:8 as was done for the 13vPnC 
assessments in support of the infant/young children indication. However, additional more stringent 
qualification and validation of the improved mcOPA assays did not support a universal LLOQ of 1:8 for 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 16/86
 
 
 
 
the quantitation of a serum response and thus the following cut-offs (LLOQs) were used for the mcOPA: 
serotype 1, 1:18; serotype 3, 1:12; serotype 4, 1:21; serotype 5, 1:29; serotype 6A, 1:37; 
serotype6B, 1:43; serotype 7F, 1:210; serotype 9V, 1:345; serotype l4, 1:35; serotype 18, 1:31; 
serotype 19A, 1:18; serotype 19F, 1:48; and serotype 23F, 1:13. 
Given the range of LLOQs, the individual LLOQs are used for each of the serotypes as “serotype 
specific cut-offs” rather than the previously proposed cut-off of 1:8. 
It should also be noted that because of the changes to the assay LLOQs, the study endpoints for 
clinical trials 6115A1-004, 6115A1-500, and 6115A1-3005 required modification because they 
originally involved determining the proportion of vaccinated subject exhibiting an OPA titer of ≥1:8. 
Endpoints that involve use of an OPA titer of ≥ 1:8 were changed to endpoints that describe use of an 
OPA titer ≥ LLOQ. Both studies 6115A1-004 and 6115A1-3005 were conducted in the United States 
and therefore the protocol amendments were filed to the investigational new drug application (IND). 
None of the remaining study protocols required a protocol amendment because they did not originally 
describe an OPA titer of ≥1:8 as a study objective. 
The OPA assay is considered an appropriate method for determination of immune responses following 
vaccination as it measures functional antibodies. In children the OPA titres have been shown to 
correlate to protection, and the ELISA IgG levels have been shown to correlate to OPA results after 
vaccination with conjugate vaccines. No such correlate of protection has been established for adults. 
Therefore, the OPA titres, representing functional immune responses is considered more likely to 
reflect protection than IgG levels measured by ELISA. Thus, the CHMP endorsed the choice of OPA as 
primary assay instead of ELISA for the adult development program. 
The OPA assay was used in the paediatric studies, but has now been modified for high-throughput 
clinical testing. The assay is considered validated, and the LLOQ have been justified.   
Justification for Use of OPA Comparisons as Immunologic Basis for Licensure 
In infants, serotype-specific capsular antipolysaccharide binding antibody of 0.35 μg/ mL accompanied 
by functional opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and elicited after administration of CRM197 conjugate 
pneumococcal vaccine has been established as a correlate of protection against IPD. In infants, the 
presence of IgG binding antibody is a necessary but insufficient condition for this protection. This is 
best evidenced by the ability of 7vPnC to protect against all serotypes contained in the vaccine (4, 6B, 
9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) but the failure of 7vPnC to protect against serotype 19A. For each of the 
serotypes contained in 7vPnC, IgG responses have been shown to correlate with OPA response. In 
contrast, serotype 19F elicits IgG serotype-specific antipolysaccharide binding antibody to 19A, but 
without an accompanying OPA response. This deficiency in OPA response is likely responsible for the 
failure of 7vPnC to protect against 19A. (13vPnC contains 19A, elicits an IgG response correlated with 
OPA response, and is expected to confer protection against this serotype in infants.) Therefore, when 
the anti-polysaccharide IgG response as measured by ELISA is correlated with a serotype-specific OPA 
response, protection is afforded by the CRM197 conjugate vaccine. 
In contrast to the experience in infants, there is no established correlate of protection against 
pneumococcal disease after either 23vPS or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in adults. However, both 
elicit OPA responses to serotypes contained in the respective vaccines. Also, 7vPnC or 9vPnC in adults 
induces OPA titers that are concordant (by serotype) with those achieved after effective vaccination in 
children; consequently, in adults, similar OPA responses elicited by 13vPnC are likely to be associated 
with protection against pneumococcal disease. Given that 23vPS provides limited protection against 
IPD but not VT-CAP, that opsonophagocytic antibody response is fundamental to protection, and that 
OPA has been demonstrated to be associated with this protection against IPD and pneumonia in 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 17/86
 
 
 
 
children, it is appropriate to compare OPA responses in adults after 13vPnC to those after 23vPS, for 
serotypes in common, as a basis for adult indications.  
3.3.4.  Efficacy Study Results 
Pivotal Non inferiority Trial (Study 004) 
Study 004 was a phase 3, randomized, modified double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter trial 
conducted in the United States in subjects naïve to previous 23vPS. Results from subjects aged 60-64 
years (cohort 1) and 50-59 years (cohort 2) are provided in this summary. The primary objectives of 
this study were: to demonstrate that immune response to 13vPnC was non inferior to that of 23vPS for 
the 12 serotypes common to both vaccines, as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers; and to 
demonstrate that the proportion of subjects with a 4-fold increase in anti-6A OPA titer was statistically 
significantly greater in the 13vPnC group than in the 23vPS group. Subjects (planned: 370 in each 
group; actual: 418 in the 13vPnC group and 417 in the 23vPS group) in cohort 1 were randomly 
assigned to either 13vPnC or 23vPS in a 1:1 ratio; 417 subjects in the 13vPnC group and 414 subjects 
in the 23vPS group were vaccinated. Of the 406 subjects in cohort 2 assigned to open label 13vPnC, 
404 subjects were vaccinated. An overview of study details is provided in below.

The immunogenicity analyses were based on results of OPA and IgG ELISA measurements of antibody 
levels in blood samples taken at protocol specified time points. All subjects provided blood samples for 
OPA analysis at baseline (on day 1 before vaccine administration) and approximately 1 month after 
vaccination. Blood samples for OPA analysis at 1 year after vaccination were obtained from a subset of 
100 subjects. 
Blood samples for all IgG ELISA analyses were obtained from a subset of 100 subjects; these blood 
samples were obtained at baseline (on day 1 before vaccine administration), approximately 1 month 
after vaccination, and approximately 12 months after vaccination.  
The evaluable immunogenicity population of cohort 1 included 411 (98.3%) subjects in the 13vPnC 
group and 407 (97.6%) subjects in the 23vPS group. The demographic results and baseline 
characteristics were comparable in subjects randomly assigned to each vaccine group with respect to 
race, and age. However, a disparity in proportion of males to females was noted, particularly in the 
23vPS group (ie, 61.2% female, 38.8% male) when compared with the 13vPnC group (ie, 53.5% 
female, 46.5% male). This disparity was addressed in an ad hoc analysis of immune response by sex. 
The evaluable immunogenicity population for cohort 2 included 388 (95.6%) subjects and the all 
available immunogenicity population included 403 (99.3%) subjects (Table 5). All subjects received 
open-label 13vPnC. The primary analysis population was the evaluable immunogenicity population for 
each cohort.

Cohort 1 - OPA Response 
OPA GMTs 
To assess non-inferiority of OPA response to 13vPnC relative to 23vPS, a 2-fold non-inferiority criterion 
of a lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of > 0.5 was applied. Results showed that OPA GMTs after 
13vPnC were non-inferior to those after 23vPS for all 12 serotypes common to both vaccines (Table 6). 
OPA GMT ratios (13vPnC to 23vPS) ranged from 0.9 (serotype 14) to 5.2 (serotype 23F) and values at 
the lower limits of the 95% CIs for the ratios were ≥ 0.64 for all serotypes. For 8 of the 12 common 
serotypes, the 95% CI lower limit for the ratio was > 1.0, indicating that OPA GMTs were statistically 
significantly greater in the 13vPnC group than in the 23vPS group (secondary objective).

At 1 year after vaccination, OPA titers were higher in the 13vPnC group than in the 23vPS group for 7 
of 12 common serotypes (all except serotypes 5, 14, 19A, and 19F). At the 1 year post-vaccination 
time point, OPA titers remained higher than pre-vaccination levels, but were lower than levels 
observed at 1 month after vaccination (Table 7).

2) – Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving OPA Titers ≥ LLOQ  
Non-inferiority of response to 13vPnC relative to that of 23vPS was also assessed for the proportion of 
subjects achieving OPA titers ≥ LLOQ (ie, proportion of responders); the noninferiority criterion was 
achieved if the difference [13vPnC – 23vPS] at the lower limit of the 95% CI was > -10% for each 
serotype. 
The non-inferiority criterion for proportion of responders to 13vPnC relative to 23vPS was met for all 
serotypes (Table 8). Differences ranged from -1.2% (serotype 19F) to 23.2% (serotype 23F) and 
differences at the lower limits of the 95% CIs were ≥ -5.6% for all serotypes (secondary objective). 
The analyses of proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ 1:8 supported these findings.

Table 8.  Comparison of Subjects Aged 60-64 Years (Cohort 1) Achieving an OPA Titer of ≥LLOQ 1 
Month After Vaccination With 13vPnC and 23vPS – Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
OPA Responses to Serotype 6A 
Proportion of responders at prespecified anti-6A OPA levels: A co-primary immunogenicity objective in 
cohort 1 was to demonstrate that the proportion of subjects achieving a 4-fold increase in anti-6A OPA 
titer was statistically significantly greater in the 13vPnC group than in the 23vPS group; the criterion 
for achieving this objective was a lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in proportions (13vPnC – 
23vPS) of >0. 
Results showed that this criterion was met. The proportion of subjects achieving a 4-fold increase in 
anti-6A OPA titer was statistically significantly higher in the 13vPnC group (88.5%, 95% CI: 84.8; 91.6) 
than in the 23vPS group (49.3%, 95% CI: 44.2; 54.5). The difference in proportions between groups 
(13vPnC – 23vPS) was 39.2% and the difference at the lower limit of the 95% CI was 33.0% (ie, well 
above the threshold of >0). 
The proportion of subjects achieving an anti-6A OPA titer ≥LLOQ was assessed to address a secondary 
objective. This objective was achieved if the lower limit of the 95% CI for proportion of responders to 
13vPnC was ≥85%. Results showed that the proportion of responders to serotype 6A in 13vPnC was 
95.8%, with a lower limit of the 95% CI of 93.3%, thus exceeding the criterion. In addition, the 
proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥LLOQ was statistically significantly higher in the 13vPnC 
group than in the 23vPS group (ie, the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in proportions 
[13vPnC – 23vPS] was >0). The difference in proportion of responders was 26.6% and the difference 
at the lower limit of the 95% CI was 21.7%. 
The analyses of proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ 1:8 supported these findings.

Anti-6A OPA GMTs: To address a secondary objective, anti-6A OPA GMTs in the 2 vaccine groups were 
compared. For serotype 6A, statistical significance was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided, 
95% CI for the geometric mean ratio (GMR, 13vPnC GMT/23vPS GMT) was >2.0. Results showed that 
responses were statistically significantly higher in the 13vPnC group (GMT: 2593) than in the 23vPS 
group (GMT: 213). The ratio (13vPnC GMT/ 23vPS GMT) was 12.1 and the ratio at the lower limit of 
the 95% CI was 8.63. 
IgG Response 
IgG GMCs were also compared in the 13vPnC group relative to the 23vPS group in a subset of 
approximately 100 subjects per group (Table 9-7). The same 2-fold noninferiority criterion used for the 
OPA evaluation was used for the IgG analysis (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of > 0.5). 
The noninferiority of 13vPnC relative to 23vPS was demonstrated for 11 of 12 common serotypes 
(exception, serotype 14). Ratios among the 11 serotypes ranged from 0.86 (serotype 5) to 2.05 
(serotype 18C), and the lower limits of the 95% CIs were ≥ 0.58. The ratio for serotype 14 was 0.73 
and the ratio at the lower limit of the 95% CI was 0.46 (Table 9).

23vPS in a Subset of Subjects Aged 60-64 Years (Cohort 1) – Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
Furthermore, IgG GMCs were statistically significantly higher (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the 
ratio of > 1.0) in the 13vPnC group relative to the 23vPS group for 4 of 12 common serotypes 
(serotypes 4, 7F, 18C, 23F). 
At 1 year after vaccination, IgG GMCs remained higher than pre-vaccination levels in all vaccine groups 
(Table 10).

(Cohort 1) and 50-59 Years (Cohort 2) - Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
Response Curves 
Antibody response curves of OPA titers and IgG concentrations from baseline (prevaccination) to 1 
month after vaccination, and 1 year after vaccination showed increased OPA and IgG antibody levels 
from baseline to 1 month after vaccination. These levels decreased from 1 month to 1 year after 
vaccination. OPA and GMC curves for all serotypes were higher at 1 year after vaccination than before 
vaccination for all serotypes in both vaccine groups. In general, the decline in serum concentrations 
from 1 month after vaccination to 1 year after vaccination was similar in the 13vPnC and 23vPS 
groups.

OPA Response 
OPA GMTs: Comparison of OPA GMTs in subjects 50 to 59 years old in cohort 2 relative to those of 
subjects 60 to 64 years old in cohort 1 showed that responses were similar or higher in the younger 
cohort (Table 11). All serotypes met the 2-fold noninferiority criterion (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI 
for the ratio of > 0.5) and OPA GMTs for 8 of 13 serotypes were statistically significantly higher (ie, a 
lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of > 1.0) in cohort 2 relative to cohort 1. Ratios (cohort 2 to 
cohort 1) ranged from 1.0 (serotype 3) to 1.7 (serotype 6A), and values at the lower limits of the 95% 
CIs for the ratios ranged from 0.81 (serotype 3) to 1.30 (serotype 6A). 
Table 11.  Comparison of Pneumococcal OPA Titer GMTs 1 Month After Vaccination With 13vPnC in 
Subjects Aged 50-59 Years Old (Cohort 2) and 60-64 Years Old (Cohort 1) - Evaluable Immunogenicity 
Population 
At 1 year after vaccination, OPA GMTs remained higher in cohort 2 than in cohort 1 for all serotypes. In 
both groups OPA levels at 1 year after vaccination remained higher than prevaccination levels (Table 
7). 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving OPA Titers ≥ LLOQ: The proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer 
≥ LLOQ after 13vPnC were non-inferior in cohort 2 relative to cohort 1 for all 13vPnC serotypes (Table 
9-9). (The noninferiority criterion was defined as a lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in 
proportions [cohort 2 – cohort 1] of >-10%). Differences ranged from -0.9% (serotype 5) to 4.4% 
(serotype 7F) and differences at the lower limits of the 95% CIs ranged from -5.8% (serotype 5) to 
0.8% (serotype 6B). 
The analyses of proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ 1:8 supported these findings. 
Trial in a Population Preimmunized With 23vPS (Study 3005) 
Study 3005 was a phase 3, randomized, modified double-blind, active-control, multicenter trial to 
assess the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of 13vPnC in healthy subjects aged ≥70 years who 
had received a previous vaccination with 23vPS at least 5 years before study enrolment (see study

schema). The primary objectives of the study were: 1) to demonstrate that OPA response to 13vPnC is 
non-inferior to that of 23vPS when measured 1 month after the initial vaccination; and 2) to 
demonstrate that the proportion of subjects achieving a 4-fold rise in anti- 6A OPA titer is statistically 
significantly greater in the 13vPnC group than in the 23vPS group, when measured 1 month after 
vaccination 1. The study was designed as a parallel group study in which 938 subjects were randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 vaccine groups: 13vPnC (n = 464) or 23vPS (n=474). All subjects 
received a dose of 13vPnC 1 year after the initial dose.

The immunogenicity analyses were based on serotype-specific OPA responses measured in blood 
samples obtained on the day of each vaccination (before vaccine administration) and approximately 1 
month after each vaccination. 
The evaluable immunogenicity population for vaccination 1 included 879 (93.7%).subjects and for 
vaccination 2 included 745 (79.4%) subjects. The all available immunogenicity population for 
vaccination 1 included 936 (99.8%) subjects and for vaccination 2 included 797 (85.0%) subjects 
(Table 12 and Table 13). The 2 vaccine groups were similar with respect to sex, race, and age at 
vaccination. In the 13vPnC and 23vPS groups, respectively, there was an even distribution by sex 
(52.3% male and 47.7% female, 50.3% male and 49.7% female), and the majority of subjects (95.9% 
and 96.0%) were characterized as white. The mean age at vaccination was 76.7 years for both the 
13vPnC and 23vPS groups.

The primary immunologic comparison was the serotype-specific pneumococcal response to each of the 
13 serotypes in 13vPnC in the 13vPnC group relative to those in the 23vPS group, as measured by OPA 
assay in blood samples taken 1 month after vaccination. The primary endpoint was the OPA GMT for 
each serotype in each vaccination group. To address the primary objective, non inferiority of response 
to 13vPnC relative to 23vPS was assessed. The non inferiority criterion for OPA GMTs was a lower limit 
of the 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio of >0.5. Non inferiority of the proportion of subjects 
achieving prespecified levels was also assessed; the non inferiority criterion was a lower limit of the 
95% CI for the difference in proportions (test – reference) of >-10%. 
Vaccination 1 
OPA Response to Common Serotypes 
OPA GMTs: To address the primary objective, OPA GMTs in the 13vPnC group were compared to those 
in the 23vPS group (Table 14). Results showed that OPA response to 13vPnC was non inferior to that 
of 23vPS in preimmunised subjects for all common serotypes. The GMT ratios ranged from 1.1 
(serotype 14) to 3.7 for (serotype 23F). The lower limits of the 95% CIs for the ratios were all >0.5, 
thus meeting the 2-fold non inferiority criterion. In addition OPA GMTs were statistically significantly 
higher (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of >1) in the 13vPnC group for 10 of 12 common 
serotypes (all except serotypes 3 and 14, secondary objective).

Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
Proportion of responders: The proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥LLOQ (ie, responders) 1 
month after vaccination with 13vPnC was non inferior to the proportion of responders after 23vPS for 
each serotype (Table 15). Furthermore, the proportion of responders was statistically significantly 
higher after 13vPnC than after 23vPS for 9 of 12 common serotypes (ie, the lower limits of the 95% 
CIs for the differences were > 0). Differences (13vPnC -23vPS) ranged from 1.0% (serotype 14) to 
21.3% (serotype 23F) and the lower limits of the 95% CIs for the difference in proportions were >-
10%. 
The analyses using the cut-off criterion of ≥1:8 also showed non inferiority of 13vPnC relative to 23vPS 
for all 12 common serotypes.

OPA Response to Serotype 6A 
Proportion of responders: The proportion of subjects with a 4-fold increase in OPA titer for serotype 6A 
was statistically significantly greater 1 month after 13vPnC (71.1%) than after 23vPS (27.3%); ie, the 
difference (13vPnC -23vPS) was 43.8% and the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference (13vPnC – 
23vPS) in proportions was >0 (ie, 37.4% co-primary objective). 
Table 16.  Comparison of Subjects Achieving a 4 fold Increase in Titer for Serotype 6A, 13vPnC 
relative to 23vPS (year 0) – Vaccination 1 Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
The proportion of responders was significantly higher in the 13vPnC group than in the 23vPS group (ie, 
the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in proportions [13vPnC – 23vPS] was >0). The 
difference in proportions was 24.7% and the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference was 19.3% 
(Table 15). The results for the analyses of the proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer of ≥1:8 
supported this finding (data not shown in this AR). 
Anti-6A OPA GMT: The anti-6A OPA GMT was statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC (GMT: 903) 
than after 23vPS (GMT: 94. The ratio was 9.6 and the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio was 7.00, 
thus meeting the 6A criterion for statistical significance (Table 14).

Vaccination 2 and Vaccination 1 
13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 13vPnC: 
When OPA GMTs after 2 doses of 13vPnC (ie, 13vPnC/13vPnC) were compared to those after a single 
dose of 13vPnC, the lower limits of the 95% CIs for the Geometric Mean Fold Rises (GMFRs) were > 
0.5 for all serotypes (Table 17). However, OPA GMTs were statistically significantly lower (ie, a upper 
limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR of < 1.0) after 13vPnC/13vPnC than after 13vPnC alone for 2 of 13 
serotypes (serotypes 4 and 5). For 3 of the 13 serotypes (serotypes 6A, 6B, and 23F), the lower limits 
of the 95% CIs for the GMFRs exceeded 1.0, indicating that the OPA response was statistically 
significantly greater after 13vPnC/13vPnC than after 13vPnC for these serotypes. 
Table 17.  Comparison of Pneumococcal OPA GMTs and GMFRs, 13vPnC/13vPnC (Year 1) Relative to 
13vPnC (Year 0) - Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
One of the exploratory objectives of the study was a comparison of the proportion of subjects 
achieving an OPA titer ≥LLOQ after 13vPnC/13vPnC was non inferior to that after a single dose of 
13vPnC for all serotypes, using the non inferiority criterion applied in the pivotal non inferiority study 
(ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference [13vPnC/13vPnC - 13vPnC] of > -10%). In addition 
proportions were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/13vPnC than after 13vPnC alone for 5 of 
the 13 serotypes (3, 6A, 6B, 18C, 23F). Differences ranged from -2.0% (serotype 7F) to 10.1% 
(serotype 23F) and lower limits of the 95% CIs for the difference were ≥ -6.2% (Table 18).

13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 23vPS: 
OPA responses for all common serotypes met the non-inferiority criterion after 13vPnC/13vPnC when 
compared with those after 23vPS (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio [13vPnC/13vPnC - 
23vPS] of >0.5, secondary objective, Table 9-7). In addition, 9 of 12 common serotypes elicited 
responses that were statistically significantly greater after 13vPnC/13vPnC than after 23vPS (all except 
serotypes 3, 7F, 14). The ratios ranged from 0.8 (serotype 14) to 7.3 (serotype 23F), and the lower 
limits of the 95% CIs for the ratio were ≥ 0.62. 
OPA response to serotype 6A after 13vPnC/13vPnC (GMT: 1134) was statistically significantly greater 
than after 23vPS (GMT: 94). Statistical significance was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided, 
95% CI for the ratio was >2 (secondary objective). The ratio for serotype 6A was 12.1 and the lower 
limit of the 95% CI for the ratio was 8.92 (Table 19).

13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 23vPS/13vPnC: 
For 12 of 13 serotypes, OPA GMTs were statistically significantly greater after 13vPnC/13vPnC than 
after 23vPS/13vPnC. Ratios ranged from 1.2 (serotype 14) to 3.6 (serotype 23F); the lower limits of 
the 95% CIs for the ratio were ≥1 for all serotypes, except for serotype 14 (0.89). 
In an ad hoc analysis, the proportion of responders ≥LLOQ after 13vPnC/13vPnC met the non 
inferiority criterion applied in the pivotal non inferiority study for all serotypes (ie, a lower limit of the 
95% CI for the difference [13vPnC/13vPnC – 23vPS/13vPnC] of > -10%). In addition proportions were 
statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/13vPnC than after 23vPS/13vPnC for 11 of the 13 
serotypes (all except serotypes 14 and 19A). Differences among serotypes ranged from 2.8% 
(serotype 19A) to 23.0% (serotype 23F) and lower limits of the 95% CIs for the difference were ≥ -
1.2% (Table 20).

23vPS/13vPnC relative to 13vPnC: 
OPA GMTs after 23vPS/13vPnC were statistically significantly lower than after 13vPnC alone for all 
serotypes (Table 21). Ratios (23vPS/13vPnC to 13vPnC) ranged from 0.4 (serotypes 3, 9V) to 0.7 
(serotypes 14, 19A), and the upper limits of the 95% CIs were all <1. The lower limit of the 95% CI 
for the ratio was >0.5 for 2 serotypes (serotypes 19A, 14).

Antibody Response Curves 
OPA responses increased from the day of vaccination 1 before administration of 13vPnC or 23vPS to 
the blood draw approximately 1 month after vaccination 1. For all serotypes, OPA GMTs showed a 
decline over the year, from 1 month after vaccination 1 to the day of vaccination 2 (before 
vaccination). At the prevaccination 2 time point, all levels remained higher than baseline levels 
observed before vaccination 1 for each group. In each vaccine group, GMTs rose from before 
vaccination 2 to 1 month after vaccination 2. OPA GMTs after vaccination 2 exceeded values noted 
after vaccination 1 for several serotypes in each vaccine group: serotypes 6A, 6B, 18C and 23F for 
13vPnC/13vPnC and serotypes 4, 6A, 6B, 18C, and 23F for 23vPS/13vPnC. From the day of vaccination 
1 to 1 month after vaccination 2, the curves for 23vPS/13vPnC were lower, to varying degrees, than 
those for 13vPnC/13vPnC for most serotypes.  
Trial with sequential use of 13vPnC and 23vPS (Study 3010) 
Study 3010 was a phase 3, parallel-group, randomised, active-controlled, modified double-blind 
multicenter trial (Figure 2-2). The study was conducted to assess the immunogenicity, tolerability, and 
safety of the sequential use of 2 doses of 13vPnC or 13vPnC followed, or proceeded, by 23vPS when 
administered to adults aged 60 to 64 years who were naïve to 13vPnC. 
The primary objectives of the study were: to demonstrate non-inferiority of OPA response to 23vPS 
administered 1 year after an initial dose of 13vPnC (ie, 13vPnC/23vPS) relative to a dose of 23vPS 
alone; and to demonstrate non-inferiority of OPA response to 23vPS administered 1 year after an initial 
dose of 13vPnC (ie, 13vPnC/23vPS) relative to 13vPnC administered 1 year after an initial dose of 
23vPS (23vPS/13vPnC). A total of 720 subjects were randomly assigned in a 3:5:4 ratio to 1 of 3 
groups (Figure 2-2). Group 1.1 (180 subjects) received 13vPnC at year 0 and 13vPnC at year 1 (ie, 
13vPnC/13vPnC). Group 1.2 (302 subjects) received 13vPnC at year 0 and 23vPS at year 1 (ie, 
13vPnC/23vPS). Group 2 (238 subjects) received 23vPS at year 0 and a subsequent dose of 13vPnC at 
year 1 (ie, 23vPS/ 13vPnC). An overview of the details of the study is provided below.

The immunogenicity analyses were based on results of OPA assays performed on blood samples 
obtained on the day of each vaccination (before vaccine administration) and approximately 1 month 
after each vaccination. 
The vaccination 1 and 2 all-available and evaluable immunogenicity population are summarised in 
Table 22 and Table 23 respectively.  The vaccine groups were similar with respect to sex, race, and 
age at vaccination. In the vaccination 1 safety population, approximately 58% of the subjects were 
women and 42% of the subjects were men. Most subjects (95.4%) were characterized as being white. 
The mean age at vaccination was 61.7 years in both vaccine groups.

The primary endpoint for the immunogenicity analyses was the serotype-specific OPA GMTs measured 
before and after each vaccination. Comparisons were made using ratios of the GMTs (test to reference). 
Geometric fold rises (GMFRs) from vaccination 1 to vaccination 2 in subjects randomly assigned to the 
sequence 13vPnC/13vPnC or the sequence 13vPnC/23vPS were also calculated. The 2-fold 
noninferiority criterion was achieved if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio 
(test/ reference) was greater than 0.5. Ad hoc analyses were performed for the proportion of subjects 
achieving an OPA titer of ≥ LLOQ. Although not prespecified for the ad hoc analyses, the same 
noninferiority criterion used in the pivotal noninferiority study was applied, i.e., a lower limit of the 
95% CI for the difference in proportions (test – reference) of >-10%. 
OPA GMTs and Proportion of Responders 
13vPnC/23vPS relative to 23vPS: 
When OPA GMTs after dose 2 of 13vPnC/23vPS were compared with those after 23vPS alone (primary 
objective), the non-inferiority criterion was met for the 12 common serotypes. In addition, responses 
were statistically significantly greater (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of >1) after 
13vPnC/23vPS than after 23vPS for 6 of 12 serotypes. For serotypes 3, 5, 6B, 7F, 19F, and 23F the 
95% CI lower bound for the ratio was > 1.0. Geometric mean ratios ranged from 0.8 (serotype 14) to 
2.8 (serotype 23F) and the lower bounds of the 95% CIs for the ratios were ≥ 0.58 (Table 24).

In the ad hoc analysis, for all serotypes the proportion of subjects achieving OPA titers ≥ LLOQ after 
13vPnC/23vPS met the non-inferiority criterion used in the pivotal non-inferiority study (ie, a lower 
limit of the 95% CI for the difference [13vPnC/23vPS - 23vPS] of >-10%) when compared with 23vPS 
alone. Proportions of responders were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/23vPS than after 
23vPS for 9 of 12 common serotypes (Table 25).

13vPnC/23vPS relative to 23vPS/13vPnC: 
Comparison of vaccination 2 results showed that OPA GMTs after 13vPnC/23vPS were non-inferior to 
those after 23vPS/13vPnC for the 12 common serotypes (co-primary objective); ie, the lower limits of 
the 95% CIs for the ratio were all greater than 0.5. In addition, for 11 of the 12 common serotypes, 
13vPnC/23vPS elicited statistically significantly greater responses than 23vPS/13vPnC (The exception 
was serotype 14, with a lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of 0.98, ie, not > 1.00) (Table 26). 
Ratios ranged from 1.4 (serotype 14) to 4.3 (serotype 7F). The lower limits of the 95% CIs for the 
ratios ranged from 0.98 (serotype 14) to 2.76 (serotype 7F) (Table 9-4).

Relative to 23vPS/13vPnC (Year 1) - Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
The ad hoc analysis showed that for all common serotypes the proportions of subjects achieving OPA 
titers ≥ LLOQ after 13vPnC/23vPS met the non-inferiority criterion used in the pivotal non-inferiority 
study (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference [13vPnC/23vPS - 23vPS/ 13vPnC] of > -10%). 
Proportions were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/23vPS than after 23vPS/ 13vPnC for 10 
of 12 common serotypes (Table 27).

13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 13vPnC: 
OPA GMTs after vaccination 2 were compared to those after vaccination 1 of the sequence 
13vPnC/13vPnC (Table 28). For 9 of the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 6A, 6B, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F), the 
lower limits of the 95% CIs for the GMFRs (ie, vaccination 2/ vaccination 1) exceeded 0.5 (secondary 
objective). However, the responses after 13vPnC/13vPnC were statistically significantly lower (ie, an 
upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR of < 1.0) than responses after 13vPnC alone for 7 of 13 
serotypes (all except serotypes 3, 6A, 6B, 14, 19F, 23F). The OPA GMT was statistically significantly 
greater after 13vPnC/13vPnC than after 13vPnC for serotype 23F.

Table 28.  Comparison of Pneumococcal OPA GMTs and GMFRs, 13vPnC (Year 0) and 13vPnC/13vPnC 
(Year 1) - Evaluable Immunogenicity Populations 
For 11 of 13 serotypes in the ad hoc analysis, the proportions of subjects achieving OPA titres ≥LLOQ 
after 13vPnC/13vPnC met the non-inferiority criterion used in the pivotal non-inferiority study (ie, a 
lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference [13vPnC/13vPnC – 13vPnC] of >-10%).The proportions of 
responders were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/13vPnC than after 13vPnC for serotypes 
3, 19F, and 23F. 
13vPnC/23vPS relative to 13vPnC: 
OPA GMTs after vaccination 2 were compared with those after vaccination 1 in subjects randomly 
assigned to the vaccine sequence 13vPnC/23vPS. For 8 of the 12 common serotypes, the lower limits 
of the 95% CIs for the GMFRs (vaccination 2/ vaccination 1) were >0.5 (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6B, 14, 18C, 
19A, and 19F). However, OPA GMTs after 13vPnC/23vPS were statistically significantly lower (ie, an 
upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR of < 1.0) than after 13vPnC alone for 8 of 12 common 
serotypes (all except serotypes 3, 5, 14, 19F). Responses were statistically significantly greater for 
13vPnC/23vPS relative to 13vPnC for serotype 3, with a GMFR of 1.7 and a value at the lower limit of 
the 95% CI of 1.5. 
For 12 of 13 serotypes in the ad hoc analysis, the proportions of responders at OPA titres ≥ LLOQ after 
13vPnC/23vPS met the non-inferiority criterion applied in the pivotal non-inferiority study (ie, a lower 
limit of the 95% CI for the difference [13vPnC/23vPS – 13vPnC] of > -10%). Proportions were 
statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/23vPS than after 13vPnC alone for serotypes 3 and 14. 
13vPnC relative to 23vPS/13vPnC:  
When OPA GMTs after dose 1 with 13vPnC were compared with those after dose 2 of 23vPS/13vPnC, 
results showed that 13vPnC elicited statistically significantly greater OPA responses than did 
23vPS/13vPnC. The lower limits of the 95% CIs for the ratios were greater than 1.0 for all 12 common 
serotypes. 
In the ad hoc analysis, for all serotypes, the proportions of subjects achieving OPA titers ≥ LLOQ after 
13vPnC met the non-inferiority criterion used in the pivotal non-inferiority study (ie, a lower limit of 
the 95% CI for the difference [13vPnC – 23vPS/ 13vPnC] of > -10%). 
Proportions were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC than after 23vPS/ 13vPnC for 10 of 13 
serotypes.

13vPnC relative to 23vPS: 
Although not a prespecified objective, an ad hoc analysis showed that OPA GMTs were statistically 
significantly higher (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio [13vPnC to 23vPS] of >1) after 13vPnC 
than after 23vPS for 10 of 12 common serotypes; the exceptions were serotypes 3 and 14, for which 
values were non-inferior (ie, the lower limits of the 95% CIs for the ratio [13vPnC to 23vPS] were >0.5) 
after 13vPnC relative to 23vPS. 
An additional ad hoc analysis showed that for all serotypes the proportions of responders at OPA titers 
≥ LLOQ in the 13vPnC group met the non-inferiority criterion used in the pivotal non-inferiority study 
004 (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference [13vPnC – 23vPS] of > -10%). The proportions 
of responders were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC than after 23vPS for 7 of 12 common 
serotypes. 
13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 23vPS: 
An ad hoc comparison of OPA GMTs showed that the non-inferiority criterion was met after 
13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 23vPS for 10 of 12 common serotypes. The lower limits of the 95% CIs 
were > 0.5 for all serotypes, except for serotype 5 (ie, 0.44) and serotype 14 (ie, 0.33). OPA GMTs 
were statistically higher after 13vPnC/13vPnC than after 23vPS for serotype 6B and serotype 23F. 
An additional ad hoc analysis showed that, for all serotypes, the proportions of responders at OPA 
titers ≥ LLOQ after 13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 23vPS met the non-inferiority criterion used in the 
pivotal non-inferiority study (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference [13vPnC/13vPnC – 
23vPS] of > -10%). Proportions were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/13vPnC for 
serotypes 3, 6B, 18C, 19F, and 23F. 
13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 23vPS/ 13vPnC: 
An ad hoc analysis showed that OPA GMTs were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/13vPnC 
than after 23vPS/ 13vPnC for 10 of 13 serotypes (all except serotypes 4, 5, 14); ie, for these 10 
serotypes, the lower limits of the 95% CIs for the ratio [13vPnC/13vPnC to 23vPS/13vPnC] were >1. 
In addition, the non-inferiority criterion used in the pivotal non-inferiority study (ie, a lower limit of the 
95% CI for the GMT ratio [13vPnC/13vPnC to 23vPS/13vPnC] of > 0.5) was met for all serotypes after 
13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 23vPS/13vPnC. Ratios ranged from 0.9 (serotype 14) to 3.8 (serotype 23F) 
and the lower limits of the 95% CIs for the ratios were ≥0.56. 
For 12 of 13 serotypes in another ad hoc analysis, the proportions of responders at OPA titers ≥ LLOQ 
after 13vPnC/13vPnC met the non-inferiority criterion applied in the pivotal non-inferiority study (ie, a 
lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference [13vPnC/13vPnC – 23vPS/ 13vPnC] of > -10%). 
Proportions were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/13vPnC for 8 of 13 serotypes. 
23vPS/13vPnC relative to 23vPS: 
In an ad hoc analysis, OPA GMTs were statistically significantly lower (ie, upper limits of the 95% CIs 
for the GMFRs [vaccination 2/ vaccination 1] of < 1) after 23vPS/13vPnC relative to 23vPS for 10 of 12 
common serotypes (all except serotypes 6B and 23F). For serotype 23F, OPA GMTs were statistically 
significantly higher (ie, lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR [vaccination 2/ vaccination 1] of >1) 
after 23vPS/13vPnC than after 23vPS alone, and for serotype 6B OPA GMTs were similar for the 2 
groups. 
For 8 of 12 common serotypes the ad hoc analysis showed that the proportion of responders at OPA 
titers ≥ LLOQ after 23vPS/13vPnC met the non-inferiority criterion applied in the pivotal non-inferiority 
study (ie, a lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference [23vPS/13vPnC – 23vPS] of > -10%). 
Proportions were statistically significantly lower after 23vPS /13vPnC than after 23vPS alone for

serotypes 1, 3, 7F, and 9V and were statistically significantly higher after 23vPS /13vPnC for serotype 
23F. 
Response to Serotype 6A: 
Evaluation of response to serotype 6A (the serotype that is not included in 23vPS) showed that the 
anti-6A OPA GMT point estimate was higher after 13vPnC/23vPS (GMT: 1268) than after a single dose 
of 23vPS (275) or after 23vPS/13vPnC (GMT: 1133). Response to serotype 6A was also higher after a 
single dose of 13vPnC (2766) relative to the sequence 23vPS/13vPnC (GMT: 1133) In addition, the 
point estimate for the OPA GMT after a single dose of 13vPnC (GMT: 2682) was higher than that after 
2 doses of 13vPnC (GMT: 2281), in subjects who received both doses. Furthermore in subjects 
receiving each vaccination of the sequence 13vPnC/23vPS, OPA response after 13vPnC/23vPS (GMT: 
1302) was statistically significantly lower than after 13vPnC alone (GMT: 3068). 
Antibody Response Curves 
For the 13 serotypes, OPA responses rose substantially from the day of vaccination 1 to the blood draw 
approximately 1 month after vaccination 1 with either 13vPnC or 23vPS. For all serotypes, OPA GMTs 
showed a decline over the year, from 1 month after vaccination 1 to the day of vaccination 2 (before 
vaccination). However, at the prevaccination 2 time point all levels remained substantially higher than 
baseline levels observed before vaccination 1 for each group  
In each vaccine group, GMTs rose from before vaccination 2 to 1 month after vaccination 2. OPA GMTs 
after vaccination 2 exceeded values noted after vaccination 1 for a few serotypes in each vaccine 
group: serotypes 3 and 23F for 13vPnC/13vPnC; serotypes 3 and 19F for 13vPnC/23vPS; and 
serotypes 6A and 23F for 23vPS/13vPnC. For most serotypes, the antibody response curves for 
23vPS/13vPnC were lower than those for 13vPnC/13vPnC and 13vPnC/23vPS, except for serotypes 3, 
5, and 14. 
Concomitant Use of Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Studies 3001 and 3008) 
Study 3001 
Study 3001 was a phase 3, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial to evaluate the 
immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of 13vPnC when administered concomitantly with TIV (Fluarix) 
(13vPnC+TIV) in healthy adults aged 50 to 59 years who were naïve to 23vPS (see study schema). 
The primary objectives of the study were: 1) to demonstrate that immune responses induced by the 
licensed influenza vaccine TIV when given concomitantly with 13vPnC were noninferior to immune 
responses elicited by TIV alone (ie, TIV given with placebo); and 2) to demonstrate that the serotype-
specific IgG responses to 13vPnC when given concomitantly with TIV are noninferior to IgG responses 
elicited by 13vPnC alone when given 1 month after administration of TIV. A total of 1116 subjects were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment groups: group 1 received 13vPnC with concomitant 
TIV followed 1 month later by placebo (13vPnC + TIV/placebo, n = 554); group 2 received placebo 
with TIV followed 1 month later by 13vPnC (placebo + TIV/13vPnC, n = 562).

The immunogenicity analyses were based on results of assays performed on blood samples taken on 
the day of each vaccination (before vaccine administration) and approximately 1 month after the 
second vaccination. To assess immune response to TIV, the standard hemagglutination inhibition 
assays (HAIs) were used to measure antibody response to the A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B vaccine strains 
selected for the 2007/ 2008 influenza season. IgG ELISA was used to measure serotype-specific 
response to 13vPnC. The evaluable immunogenicity population included a total of 1063 subjects 
(95.3%): 531 subjects (95.8%) in the 13vPnC + TIV/placebo group and 532 subjects (94.7%) in the 
placebo+ TIV/13vPnC group. The demographic and baseline characteristics in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population were similar in subjects randomly assigned to each vaccine sequence with 
respect to sex, race, and age. 
Response to TIV 
The primary endpoint for the comparison of TIV + 13vPnC versus TIV + placebo was the proportion of 
subjects who achieved at least a 4-fold increase in the HAI titer (ie, proportion who seroconverted) 
elicited by each influenza strain included in the vaccine. The noninferiority criterion for proportion of 
responders was a lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference (13vPnC + TIV – placebo + TIV) in 
proportion of responders of greater than -10%. 
The non-inferiority criterion for the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥4-fold rise in HAI titer was met 
for all 3 strains of TIV after dose 1 (Table 29).  
Table 29.  Comparison of Subjects Achieving a ≥4-Fold Increase in Titer for Concomitant Vaccine (TIV) 
Antigens After Dose 1 (Year 0) – Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
At baseline before dose 1, GMTs were higher for A/H3N2 (43.44 before 13vPnC+TIV and 49.45 before 
placebo+TIV) than for the other vaccine strains, which elicited GMTs ranging across vaccine groups 
from 14.00 to 26.02. The higher baseline GMTs for A/H3N2 may have been due to exposure to this 
strain in the previous influenza season. After vaccination, the A/H3N2 GMTs increased approximately 
10-fold. 
Response to 13vPnC 
Pneumococcal responses were assessed approximately 1 month after vaccination in a subset of 605 
subjects. The primary endpoint for the pneumococcal analysis was the GMCs for each serotype. Non-
inferiority of IgG response to 13vPnC + TIV relative to 13vPnC alone was assessed based on the GMR 
and the 2-fold non-inferiority criterion (ie, a lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI for the GMR of greater 
than 0.5). 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 42/86
 
 
 
 
 
 
The non-inferiority criterion was met for all serotypes. IgG GMCs ranged from 1.15 μg/mL (serotype 3) 
to 16.80 μg/mL (serotype 19A) in 13vPnC + TIV recipients and from 1.46 μg/mL (serotype 3) to 18.84 
μg/mL (serotype 19A) in 13vPnC recipients. The geometric mean ratios ranged from 0.69 (serotype 4) 
to 0.89 (serotype 19A), and ratios at the lower limits of the 95% CIs ranged from 0.55 (serotype 4) to 
0.74 (serotype 19A). 
GMFRs from baseline (before dose 1) to 1 month after each dose were also assessed for each serotype 
in the 2 groups. GMFRs from before to after dose 1 with 13vPnC+TIV ranged from 2.60 (serotype 3) to 
11.95 (serotype 18C). GMFRs from before dose 1 to 1 month after dose 2 with 13vPnC alone ranged 
from 2.71 (serotype 3) to 14.72 (serotype 4). GMFRs at the lower limits of the 95% CIs ranged from 
2.33 (serotype 3) to 10.20 (serotype 18C) after 13vPnC+TIV and from 2.42 (serotype 3) to 12.41 
(serotype 4) after 13vPnC. 
Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves (RCDCs) showed the distribution of IgG responses in both 
groups by serotype. In general the curves were slightly lower for the 13vPnC+TIV group compared 
with the 13vPnC group; however at antibody concentrations of 1.0 μg/mL or less, the curves for most 
serotypes overlapped.  
Study 3008 
Study 3008 was a phase 3, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC when administered concomitantly with TIV 
(13vPnC+TIV) in healthy adults aged 65 years or older who were naïve to 23vPS (Figure 2-4). The 
primary objectives of the study were: 1) to demonstrate that immune responses induced by the 
licensed influenza vaccine TIV when given concomitantly with 13vPnC (13vPnC+TIV) were noninferior 
to immune responses elicited by TIV given with placebo (ie, TIV + placebo), as measured by the 
standard HAI for the A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B vaccine strains; and 2) to demonstrate that the 
serotype-specific IgG responses to 13vPnC when given concomitantly with TIV are noninferior to IgG 
responses elicited by 13vPnC alone when given 1 month after administration of TIV. 
1160 subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment groups: group 1 received 13vPnC 
+ TIV followed 1 month later by placebo (13vPnC+TIV/placebo, 580 subjects); group 2 received 
placebo with TIV followed 1 month later by 13vPnC (placebo+TIV/13vPnC, 580 subjects).

response to the A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B vaccine strains selected for the 2007/ 2008 influenza season. 
IgG ELISA was used to measure serotype-specific IgG response to 13vPnC.  
The evaluable immunogenicity population included a total of 1096 subjects (94.5%); of these, 549 
evaluable subjects (94.7%) were assigned to the 13vPnC+TIV/placebo group and 547 subjects 
(94.3%) were assigned to the placebo+TIV/13vPnC group. The demographic and baseline

characteristics in the evaluable immunogenicity population were similar in subjects randomly assigned 
to each vaccine sequence with respect to sex, race and age.   
Response to TIV 
The primary endpoint for the comparison of 13vPnC+TIV versus placebo+TIV was the proportion of 
subjects (ie, responders) achieving at least a 4-fold increase in HAI titer elicited by each influenza 
strain in TIV (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B vaccine strains) approximately 1 month after vaccination.  
The non-inferiority criterion for the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥4-fold increase in HAI titer (ie, 
proportion who seroconverted) was met for the A/H1N1 and B vaccine strains, but was missed by a 
very small margin for A/H3N2 (ie, missing the predefined non-inferiority criterion by 0.4%) (Table 30). 
Differences between the 2 vaccine groups for A/H1NI, A/H3N2, and B were 1.7%, -4.6%, and -1.8%, 
respectively, and lower limits of the 95%CIs for the differences were -3.1%, -10.4% and -7.8%, 
respectively. Thus, the value for A/H3/N2 was slightly lower than the predefined non-inferiority 
criterion of >-10% (Table 30). 
Table 30.  Comparison of Subjects Achieving a ≥4-Fold Increase in Titer for Concomitant Vaccine 
Antigens After Dose 1 - Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
The proportion of seroconversions of greater than 30% (as per EMA guidance) was exceeded for all 3 
strains. The proportions of responders after dose 1 in the 13vPnC+TIV group and placebo+TIV group, 
respectively, were: A/H1N1, 80.3% and 78.6%; A/H3N2, 58.0% and 62.6%; and B, 52.2% and 
54.0%. 
The GMFRs for each strain in each vaccine group surpassed the value for a geometric mean increase 
after vaccination of greater than 2.0.  
In contrast to the other 2 influenza strains, the prevaccination 1 HAI titers for A/H3N2 were quite high, 
ie, 62.9 in 13vPnC+TIV recipients and 65.3 in placebo + TIV recipients. This result perhaps reflects the 
pressure due to A/H3N2 epidemics that have been observed over several years before the study. In 
the region where the study was conducted, H3N2 predominated over H1N1 and B in the 2006–2007 
season and in 4 of the 5 prior influenza seasons. Higher prevaccination titers may limit the likelihood of 
demonstrating a ≥ 4-fold increase in HAI responses, and the lower frequency of response would be 
expected to impact the ability to demonstrate non-inferiority. 
An additional endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving HAI titers ≥40 (ie, responders). The 
proportion of responders was similar in the 2 vaccine groups and exceeded the value of 60% for each 
vaccine strain. 
Response to 13vPnC 
Pneumococcal responses were assessed before dose 1 and approximately 1 month after each dose in a 
subset of 605 subjects. The primary pneumococcal comparison was evaluation if immune response in 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 44/86
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects receiving 13vPnC+TIV at dose 1 versus 13vPnC at dose 2. The primary endpoints were the 
serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG concentrations in the 13vPnC+TIV group and in the 13vPnC group.  
Non-inferiority of IgG response to 13vPnC + TIV relative to 13vPnC alone was assessed based on the 
GMR and the 2-fold non-inferiority criterion (ie, a lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR of 
>0.5).  
All serotypes met the non-inferiority criterion, except for serotype 19F. GMRs (ie, 13vPnC+TIV to 
13vPnC) ranged from 0.65 (serotype 19F) to 0.97 (serotype 6B) and the lower limits of the 95% CIs 
for the GMRs ranged from 0.49 (serotype 19F) to 0.78 (serotype 3). 
GMFRs from baseline (before dose 1) to 1 month after each dose were also assessed for each serotype. 
GMFRs from before to after dose 1 with 13vPnC+TIV ranged from 2.47 (serotype 5) to 10.77 (serotype 
4). GMFRs from before dose 1 to after dose 2 with 13vPnC alone ranged from 2.98 (serotype 3) to 
18.06 (serotype 4). GMFRs at the lower limits of the 95% CIs ranged from 2.16 (serotype 5) to 9.03 
(serotype 4) after 13vPnC+TIV and from 2.64 (serotype 3) to 14.82 (serotype 4) after 13vPnC. 
RCDCs showed the range of IgG responses in subjects receiving 13vPnC+TIV versus those receiving 
13vPnC alone. Curves were similar in both groups, although, for most serotypes, the curves were 
slightly lower in 13vPnC+TIV recipients, particularly at higher antibody concentrations (Data not shown 
in this AR). 
Supportive studies 
Study 500 
Study 500 was a randomized, open-label, active-control, phase 2 multicenter trial to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 different 13vPnC formulations, ie, 13vPnC given with 
aluminium phosphate (13vPnC + AlP04) versus 13vPnC given without aluminium phosphate (13vPnC - 
AlP04). The patient population included subjects aged 65 years and older who were naïve to previous 
immunization with 23vPS. A total of 915 subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 
vaccine groups: group 1 received 13vPnC+AlPO4; group 2 received 13vPnC-AlPO4; and, group 3 
received 23vPS (Figure 2-6).

The evaluable immunogenicity population for the formulation decision analysis (vaccination 1 only) 
included a total of 893 (97.6%) subjects, ie, 300 (97.1%) in the 13vPnC + ALPO4 group and 298 
(97.7%) in the 13vPnC - ALPO4 group, and 295 (98.0%) in the 23vPS group.  
The primary endpoint for the formulation decision analysis was the serotype-specific IgG response 
to the two 13vPnC formulations. Another endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥ 4-fold 
rise in pneumococcal IgG antibody concentration.

The non-inferiority of IgG response after 13vPnC-AlPO4 relative to 13vPnC+AlPO4 was assessed using 
the 2-fold criterion and 95% CIs; non-inferiority was declared if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the 
ratio (13vPnC-AlPO4 to 13vPnC+AlPO4) was > 0.5. The non-inferiority criterion for the proportion of 
responders at prespecified levels was a lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in proportions 
(13vPnC-AlPO4 - 13vPnC+AlPO4) of >-10%.  
IgG GMCs: IgG GMCs in the 13vPnC-AlPO4 group were non-inferior to values in the 13vPnC+AlPO4 
group for all 13 serotypes. Ratios ranged from 0.8 (23F) to 1.5 (serotype 7F), and the lower limits of 
the 95% CIs for the ratios ranged from 0.6 (23F) to 1.2 (serotype 7F). IgG GMCs were similar when 
adjusted for age, sex, current smoking status, and prevaccination 1 value. The non-inferiority criterion 
was met for all serotypes.  
Formulation decision: The data indicated that the immunogenicity of 13vPnC in adults older than 65 
years, as measured by IgG GMCs, did not differ when formulated with or without AlPO4. 
The local reactions of erythema, induration, and pain were observed significantly more frequently in 
the group that received the 13vPnC+AlPO4 formulation compared with the other groups. However, 
these reactions were predominantly mild and considered to have little direct impact on the subject’s 
functional status. Other local and systemic reactions of importance did not differ between study 
groups. The logistical considerations on maintaining two different formulations of Prevenar13 were in 
favour of the 13vPnC+AlPO4 formulation, which was chosen as the final formulation. 
Final Analysis:  
OPA GMTs (Vaccination 1): Comparisons of OPA GMTs after 13vPnC+AlPO4 and after 23vPS at 
vaccination 1 showed that responses to 10 of 12 common serotypes were statistically significantly 
greater after 13vPnC than after 23vPS (exceptions serotypes 7F and 14), and the non-inferiority 
criterion was met for 11 of 12 common serotypes (exception 7F). Among these 11 serotypes, OPA GMT 
ratios (13vPnC+AlPO4 to 23vPS) ranged from 0.88 (serotype 14) to 3.36 (serotype 9V) and the lower 
limits of the 95% CIs for the ratios ranged from 0.63 (serotype 14) to 2.30 (serotype 5). The ratio for 
serotype 7F was 0.65 and the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio was 0.46. For serotype 6A 
(serotype not contained in 23vPS), the ratio of 13vPnC+AlPO4 to 23vPS was 7.14, with a ratio at the 
lower limit of the 95% CI of 5.00. Results were similar when adjusted for age, sex, current smoking 
status, and prevaccination 1 value.  
Proportion of Subjects Achieving Prespecified OPA Antibody Levels (Vaccination 1): Results showed 
that the proportion of responders at an antibody titer ≥LLOQ in the 13vPnC+AlPO4 group was non-
inferior  to that of the 23vPS group for all 12 common serotypes; responses were statistically 
significantly higher in the 13vPnC +AlPO4 group for 6 of 12 common serotypes.  
Vaccination 1 and Vaccination 2: 13vPnC+AlPO4/13vPnC+AlPO 4 relative to 13vPnC+AlPO4: OPA GMTs
were similar or lower after 13vPnC+AlPO
4/13vPnC+AlPO 4 than after 13vPnC+AlPO 4 alone for all 
serotypes except 23F.  OPA GMTs were statistically significantly lower after 
13vPnC+AlPO4/13vPnC+AlPO 4 for 8 of 13 serotypes, with an upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR of 
< 1.0 (all except serotypes 6A, 6B, 7F, 19F, 23F). However, for serotype 23F, the OPA response was 
statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC+AlPO 4/13vPnC+AlPO4 than after 13vPnC+AlPO4 alone.  
Study 3009 
Study 3009 was an open label, single arm, multicenter trial in subjects who had previously been 
enrolled in study 500 a year earlier. Subjects who were enrolled in study 3009 had previously received 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 46/86
 
 
 
 
 
13vPnC +AlPO4 (selected formulation) at vaccination 1 and 23vPS a year later at vaccination 2 
(13vPnC +AlPO4/23vPS) in study 500.  
One hundred and five (105) subjects were given a single dose of 13vPnC in study 3009 (see study 
schema). The primary objective of the study was to compare serotype-specific OPA responses to 
13vPnC given in study 3009 (ie, vaccination 3 of the sequence 13vPnC/23vPS/13vPnC) with OPA 
responses elicited by 13vPnC given as the first dose in study 500 (ie, 13vPnC/23vPS/13vPnC versus 
13vPnC) . The study was conducted to determine whether a dose of 13vPnC (vaccination 1 in study 
500) administered before 23vPS (vaccination 2 in study 500) could protect against the reduction of 
OPA responses to a subsequent 13vPnC vaccination (vaccination 3 in study 3009). The study also 
compared IgG responses after vaccination 3 and after vaccination 1. In addition, serotype-specific OPA 
and IgG responses after vaccination 3 were compared with those after vaccination 2 of the vaccine 
sequence 13vPnC/23vPS/13vPnC. Vaccination in study 3009 was administered approximately 1 year 
after the second vaccination in study 500.

OPA GMTs 
Vaccination 3 vs vaccination 1: Point estimates for OPA GMTs for all serotypes tended to be lower after 
vaccination 3 relative to vaccination 1, and for 10 of 13 serotypes (all serotypes except 3, 6B, 23F) 
responses were statistically significantly lower (ie, upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR of <1.0) 
after vaccination 3. For serotypes 3, 6B, and 23F, the lower limits of the 95% CIs for the GMFRs were 
>0.5; for all other serotypes the lower limits of the 95% CIs for the GMFRs were <0.5.  These results 
reflect the notable decrease in immune response after the vaccine sequence 13vPnC/23vPS/13vPnC 
relative to a single dose of 13vPnC. Hence, a dose of 13vPnC given before 23vPS does not protect 
against reduced immune response to subsequent 13vPnC in this 3-dose vaccine sequence.  
The OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs were plotted at each time point before and after each of the 3 
vaccinations in the sequence 13vPnC/23vPS/13vPnC For the 13 serotypes, OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs 
increased substantially from before the first dose of 13vPnC (vaccination 1) to the blood draw 
approximately 1 month after vaccination 1. 
For all serotypes, OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs decreased over the year, from 1 month after vaccination 1 
to before vaccination 2. However, at the pre–vaccination 2 time point, all levels remained substantially 
higher than baseline levels observed before vaccination 1. OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs increased from 
before vaccination 2 to 1 month after vaccination 2. Following vaccination 3 in the vaccine sequence 
13vPnC/23vPS/13vPnC, GMTs and GMCs increased for all serotypes from before to after vaccination. 
For the majority of serotypes, there was a trend for postvaccination responses to be either similar or 
somewhat less after each subsequent vaccination in the vaccine sequence 13vPnC/23vPS/13vPnC, with 
prevaccination levels of all subsequent vaccines still well above the baseline values. 
3.3.5.  Additional data provided by the MAH during the procedure 
During the procedure the MAH has finalised a summary report of an extension to study 6115A1-004. 
The present extension of study 6115A1-004 assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
13vPnC or 23vPS when administered 3 to 4 years after an initial vaccination with 13vPnC, as well as 
the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 23vPS when administered 3 to 4 years after an 
additional vaccine with 23vPS in adults 60 to 64 years of age (cohort 1). Also, the safety, tolerability

and immunogenicity of 13vPnC was assessed when administered 3 to 4 years after an initial 
vaccination with 13vPnC in adults 50 to 59 years of age (cohort 2). Therefore, subjects in cohort 1 
received 1 of 3 vaccine sequences: 13vPnC/13vPnC, 13vPnC/23vPS, or 23vPS/23vPS. All subjects in 
cohort 2 received the vaccine sequence of 13vPnC/13vPnC.  
A brief summary of the relevant data is provided below:

Results 
A primary immunogenicity objective of the study was to assess whether responses to 23vPS 
administered 3 to 4 years after an initial dose of 13vPnC (13vPnC/23vPS) was as immunogenic as 
23vPS given alone in cohort 1. As shown in Table 31, the noninferiority criterion (lower limit of the 
95% CI for the GMR greater than 0.5) was met for all 12 common serotypes. The lower limit of the 
95% CI for the GMRs exceeded 1.0, indicating that the OPA response was statistically significantly 
greater after 13vPnC/23vPS than after 23vPS, for 9 of the 12 common serotypes: 1, 3, 5, 6B, 7F, 18C, 
19A, 19F, and 23F. The GMRs were greater than 1 for all serotypes, ranging from 1.3 (serotype 4) to 
4.7 (serotype 7F).

In summary, the results indicate that antibody responses were similar, and for the majority of 
serotypes, statistically significantly greater for 13vPnC/23vPS compared to 23vPS alone.

was statistically significantly greater after 13vPnC/23vPS than after 13vPnC, for 7 of the 12 common 
serotypes: 1, 3, 5, 7F, 14, 19A, and 19F. The upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMFRs were less than 
1.0, indicating the OPA response was statistically significantly lower after 13vPnC/23vPS than after 
13vPnC for 2 of the 12 common serotypes (4 and 9V) and serotype 6A. The serotype-specific GMFRs 
ranged from 0.3 (serotype 6A) to 2.5 (serotype 19F) with 9 of the 12 common serotypes greater than 
1.

Population  
The within-group comparison of the vaccination 2 response versus the vaccination 1 response for 
subjects in the 23vPS/23vPS vaccine sequence (23vPS/23vPS versus 23vPS) is summarised in Table 
33. The lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR was greater than 0.5 for 7 of the 12 common 
serotypes: 1, 6B, 7F, 14, 18C, 19A, and 19F. The upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMFRs was less 
than 1.0, indicating that the OPA response was statistically significantly lower after 23vPS/23vPS than 
after 23vPS for 8 of the 12 common serotypes: 3, 4, 5, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F and serotype 6A. 
The serotype-specific GMFRs ranged from 0.3 (serotype 9V) to 1.1 (serotype 7F) with only 1 serotype 
greater than 1 (serotype 7F). In summary, these results indicate a statistically significantly diminished 
antibody response after the second dose of 23vPS compared to the initial dose.

Population  
3.3.6.  Efficacy Conclusions 
The immunogenicity data from study 004 indicate that 13vPnC elicited OPA and IgG responses 1 
month after vaccination that were non-inferior to those induced by 23vPS for all common serotypes. 
For 8 of 12 common serotypes, OPA GMTs were statistically significantly greater after 13vPnC than 
after 23vPS. In addition, the proportion of subjects achieving a 4-fold rise in anti-6A titers and the 
proportion achieving the LLOQ for serotype 6A were statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC than 
after 23vPS; the anti-6A OPA GMT was also statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC than after 
23vPS. At 1 year after vaccination OPA titres remained above prevaccination levels for all serotypes. 
Comparisons between age groups showed that OPA and IgG responses to 13vPnC in subjects aged 50 
to 59 years (cohort 2) were noninferior to those aged 60-64 years (cohort 1). For each comparison 
within or between cohorts, the IgG evaluations supported the OPA analyses. 
In conclusion, the 13vPnC vaccine elicited non-inferior responses compared to the 23vPS vaccine in a 
naïve population. As expected, responses in younger subjects, 50-59 years, were generally higher than 
the responses in older subjects. The IgG responses generally support the OPA results, with the 
exception on duration of antibody responses.  
Overall, results of study 3005 showed that in adults aged ≥ 70 years who were preimmunized with 
23vPS at least 5 years before study enrolment, 13vPnC elicited statistically significantly higher OPA 
responses than those elicited by 23vPS. In addition, OPA responses after 1 and 2 doses of 13vPnC 
were similar for most serotypes in this preimmunized population. When 13vPnC was given alone or 
administered as a two dose sequence given a year apart (ie, 13vPnC/13vPnC) OPA responses were 
generally statistically significantly higher than those after 23vPS alone or after 23vPS/13vPnC. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 51/86
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study 3010, OPA responses after 13vPnC/23vPS were non-inferior to those after 23vPS for all 12 
common serotypes (primary objective) and were statistically significantly greater for 6 of 12 serotypes 
(secondary objective). In addition, OPA responses after 13vPnC/23vPS were non-inferior to those after 
23vPS/13vPnC (primary objective) and were statistically greater for 11 of the 12 common serotypes 
(exception serotype 14). Furthermore, OPA responses were statistically significantly greater after 
13vPnC compared with 23vPS/13vPnC for all serotypes. Parallel ad hoc analyses of the proportion of 
subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥LLOQ supported these results, which suggest that if both vaccines are 
to be given sequentially, then 13vPnC should preferably be given first. 
Furthermore, under the stringent conditions of 1 year dosing, comparison of responses after 
13vPnC/13vPnC to those after 13vPnC alone revealed that the lower limit of the 95% CI of the GMFR 
(vaccination 2/ vaccination 1) was >0.5 for 9 of 13 serotypes; however, OPA GMTs for 7 of 13 
serotypes were statistically significantly lower after 13vPnC/13vPnC than after 13vPnC alone. 
Nevertheless, an ad hoc comparison showed that the proportion of subjects achieving LLOQ was non-
inferior after 13vPnC/13vPnC relative to 13vPnC alone for 11 of 13 serotypes. Similar results were 
observed for the comparison of 13vPnC/23vPS relative to a single dose of 13vPnC.  
In conclusion, the 13vPnC vaccine elicits higher OPA responses than the 23vPS vaccine alone. 
Vaccination with 23vPS vaccine results in lower responses to the subsequent 13vPnC vaccine compared 
to vaccination with 13vPnC only. The responses to a second dose of 13vPnC are generally expected to 
be higher than the response to a first dose. This was not the case in this study, and therefore the 
possibility of hyporesponsiveness could not be entirely ruled out. The negative effect of a first dose of 
23vPS vaccine is clearly more pronounced than the effect of the 13vPnC vaccine.  
The results of study 3010 using repeated vaccinations in a naive population generally confirm what 
was demonstrated in the pivotal studies 004 and 3005. This study also confirms what was seen in 
study 3005, that vaccination with 23vPS vaccine followed by 13vPnC one year later results in lower 
responses than 13vPnC vaccine alone. However, the GMTs after the second dose were generally lower 
than after the first dose, regardless of what vaccine was used for first vaccination.  
13vPnC and licensed TIV are immunologically compatible when administered together. The responses 
to the TIV were very similar between the two groups, and the responses were considered adequate, i.e 
the CHMP criteria for seasonal TIV were fulfilled.  
Overall, the 3008 study results showed that 13vPnC may be given with the influenza vaccine, without 
adversely affecting pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG responses to 13vPnC or HAI responses to the 
antigens in the influenza vaccine. The results showed that the predefined non-inferiority criteria were 
fulfilled for all serotypes except 19F. 
Based on the study 500 results a formulation without AlPO4 may have been more appropriate, but the 
general safety profile of the vaccine, taking all clinical data together is not causing concern.  
In cases requiring administration of both 13vPnC and 23vPS, 13vPnC should be given first. However, it 
should be noted that antibody levels to a subsequent dose of 13vPnC given after 13vPnC/23vPS may 
be impaired by the apparent negative immunologic effect of 23vPS when administered at a 1-year 
interval.  
3.3.7.  Clinical safety 
Safety database 
Safety data were obtained from more than 5600 adults who received at least 1 dose of 13vPnC. The 
same 13vPnC formulation licensed and marketed for infants was used in all 6 phase 3 adult studies. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 52/86
 
 
 
 
Safety data were submitted to support the extension of the indication to include the use of 13vPnC in 
adults 50 years of age and older. Six primary phase 3 studies have been completed in the adult clinical 
development program, of which 4 studies conducted in adults not previously vaccinated (naive 
subjects) with the licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS) and 2 studies in 
adults who had previously received 23vPS (pre-immunized subjects).  
Safety data from the 2 supportive studies (studies 6115A1-500 and 6115A1-3009) were also 
submitted. The 6 primary studies were conducted in the United States and in various countries in 
Europe. In the 6 studies, the safety populations comprise a total of 6198 (100%) subjects, of which 
4213 (68.0%) were naive to 23vPS and 1985 (32.0%) were pre-immunized (Table 34) 
Table 34.  Number (%) of Subjects Who Received at Least 1 Dose of Study Vaccine 
Overall, 49.4% of vaccinated subjects were between 50 and 64 years of age at enrolment (per 
protocol), and 50.6% were ≥65 years of age. 
In the 6 studies, 13vPnC was administered to a total of 5667 subjects, of which 3751 (66.2%) were 
naive to 23vPS at the time of study entry and 1916 (33.8%) had previously received 23vPS (were pre-
immunized) at the time of study entry; 23vPS was administered to a total of 1391 subjects, of which 
918 (66.0%) were naive to 23vPS at the time of study entry and 473 (34.0%) had previously received 
23vPS (were pre-immunized) at the time of study entry (Table 35).

Table 35.  Number (%) of Subjects Vaccinated With 13vPnC or 23vPS at Any Time During the Study, 
by Vaccination Status 
A total of 1127 subjects naive to 23vPS received 13vPnC concomitantly with TIV (trivalent influenza 
vaccine). When summarised by age at the time of enrolment 2616 subjects (46.2%) vaccinated with 
13vPnC were between 50 and 64 years of age and 3051 (53.8%) were ≥65 years of age; 1785 
(31.5%) were 65 to 74 years of age and 1266 (22.3%) were 75 years of age and over. Among the 
1391 subjects vaccinated with 23vPS, 918 subjects (66.0%) were between 60 and 64 years of age and 
473 (34.0%) were ≥65 years of age. 
Initial and subsequent study doses of pneumococcal vaccine administered 1 year apart were evaluated 
in 2 studies (studies 3010 and 3005). In these studies, a total of 1445 subjects received vaccination 2 
in a sequence of 2 pneumococcal vaccines; at study entry, 650 of these subjects were naive to 23vPS, 
and 795 were pre-immunized (Table 36). 
Table 36.  Number (%) of Subjects Who Received Vaccination 2 of a 2-Vaccination Sequence (Study 
3005 and Study 3010) 
A total of 16 subjects were withdrawn from the studies because of adverse events (AEs). Among the 
subjects withdrawn because of AEs, 6 had received 13vPnC, 9 had received 23vPS, and 1 had received 
TIV+placebo.

Sixteen (16) subjects died during the 6 primary studies, 12 (0.21%) of the 5667 subjects who had 
received 13vPnC, and 4 (0.29%) of the 1391 subjects who had received 23vPS. None of the deaths 
were considered related to study vaccine. 
Patient exposure 
Population 
Each of the 6 primary studies enrolled adults who were within a protocol-specified age range at study 
entry: 50 to 59 years (study 6115A1-3001 and study 6115A1-004-cohort 2); 60 to 64 years (study 
6115A1-004-cohort 1, and study 6115A1-3010); ≥65 years (study 6115A1-3008); ≥68 years (study 
6115A1-3000); or ≥70 years (study 6115A1-3005). The oldest subject vaccinated was 95 years of 
age. In the 4 studies in 23vPS-naive subjects, previous vaccination with a registered or an 
investigational pneumococcal vaccine was an exclusion criterion. In the 2 studies in 23vPS-
preimmunized subjects, previous doses of 23vPS received at least 3 years (study 6115A1-3000) or at 
least 5 years (study 6115A1-3005) prior to study entry had to be documented by the subjects. 
Limitations of the Safety Database 
The study population encompassing all 6 primary trials included adults ≥50 years of age. Subjects with 
underlying chronic medical conditions not compromising the immune system were enrolled, provided 
that the disease was stable, i.e. not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for 
worsening disease for 12 weeks before receipt of study vaccine. The safety of 13vPnC has not been 
evaluated in immunocompromised high-risk subjects. The safety and immunogenicity of 13vPnC will be 
assessed in post approval studies conducted in children and adults with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection, children and adults after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and children and adults 
with sickle cell disease. 
The size of the safety database was small to detect rare AEs occurring at a frequency lower than 0.1%. 
Therefore, safety data from the 84,500 subjects in the ongoing efficacy study (CAPITA, 6115A1-3006) 
will be submitted as a postmarketing commitment. 
Safety Results 
Analysis of Adverse Reactions 
The safety of 13vPnC was evaluated on the basis of solicited AEs, including local reactions and 
systemic events, as well as unsolicited AEs. Data for solicited AEs were recorded daily by the study 
subjects for 14 days after each dose. Because of the diversity of study designs and the different ages 
of the populations evaluated, no integration or meta-analyses of safety data were performed. 
Therefore, the overview of safety is based on individual study data and, when appropriate, comparison 
of data across studies. 
Adverse events 
Solicited Adverse Events 
Local Reactions 
Local reactions at the injection site that occurred within 14 days after vaccination were to be recorded 
by subjects daily in electronic diaries (e-diaries). Information was solicited for 4 types of local 
reactions: redness, swelling, pain, and limitation of arm movement. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 55/86
 
 
 
 
 
Local Reactions After an Initial Study Vaccination of 13vPnC 
The percentage of subjects reporting local reactions at the injection site within 14 days after an initial 
study vaccination of 13vPnC is summarised in Table 37 for each of the 6 primary studies. 
The 13vPnC reactogenicity is compared across the various age groups enrolled (50 to 59 years, 60 to 
64 years, and ≥65 years of age) and between pre-immunized subjects (studies 3000 and 3005) and 
naïve subjects. In studies 3001 and 3008, for each type of local reaction (redness, swelling, pain, and 
limitation of arm movement), the percentage of subjects reporting the reaction at the 13vPnC injection 
site after administration of 13vPnC+TIV was similar to the percentage of subjects reporting the 
reaction after administration of 13vPnC alone. Table 37 includes pooled data for local reactions 
reported after dose 1 for subjects in the 13vPnC+TIV/placebo group and after dose 2 for subjects in 
the placebo+TIV/13vPnC group. (For studies 3005 and 3010, the table includes data for vaccination 1 
only). 
Table 37.  Subjects Reporting Local Reactions Within 14 Days After an Initial Study Vaccination of 
13vPnC, by Immunization Status and Age 
The incidence of redness reported after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC ranged from 10.8% to 
20.2% across the 6 studies, with no consistent differences among the age groups or between naive 
and pre-immunized subjects. In each of the 6 studies, most reports were mild, and the incidence of 
severe redness was ≤1.7%. Similar results were observed for swelling at the injection site: Across 
studies, the incidence of swelling ranged from 10.0% and 21.7%; most reports were mild; and in each 
study severe swelling was reported by ≤0.6% of subjects receiving an initial vaccination of 13vPnC. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 56/86
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of pain was higher among subjects <65 years of age (ranging from 69.2% to 88.8%) 
than among subjects ≥65 years of age (41.7% to 51.7%). The incidence of moderate pain ranged 
from 20.1% to 40.1% among subjects <65 years of age and from 7.5% to 17.2% among subjects ≥65 
years of age. Severe pain was reported most frequently among subjects 50 to 59 years of age (3.6% 
to 4.5%). 
Similarly, the incidence of limitation of arm movement decreased with increasing age, being 39.1% to 
40.7% among subjects 50 to 59 years of age, 23.5% to 28.5% among subjects 60 to 64 years of age, 
and 10.5% to 16.2% among subjects ≥65 years of age. Limitation of arm movement was most 
frequently reported as mild, and was reported as severe in ≤3.1% of subjects in any study. 
Because of variations in the incidence of local reactions across age groups, the possible effects of 
vaccination status on reactogenicity are best evaluated by comparing data for pre-immunized subjects 
(studies 3000 and 3005, in subjects ≥68 years of age) with data for naive subjects ≥65 years of age 
(study 3008). Redness, swelling, and limitation of arm movement were reported at similar incidence in 
these studies. Pain was reported somewhat more often among pre-immunized subjects (51.0% to 
51.7% of subjects) than among naïve subjects (41.7%); however, this difference was not considered 
clinically significant. 
13vPnC in 23vPS-Naive and 23vPS-Preimmunized Subjects Across Studies 
Pain at the injection site was more frequent in younger than in older subjects, ranging from 69.2% to 
88.8% among subjects <65 years old and from 41.7% to 51.7% among subjects ≥65 years of age. 
The incidence of moderate pain ranged from 20.1% to 40.1% among subjects <65 years of age and 
from 7.5% to 17.2% among subjects ≥65 years of age. Severe pain was reported most frequently 
among subjects 50 to 59 years of age (3.6% in study 6115A1-004-cohort 2, 4.5% in study 6115A1-
3001 - Table 37). Similarly, the incidence of limitation of arm movement was higher in younger 
subjects: 39.1% to 40.7% in subjects 50 to 59 years of age, 23.5% to 28.5% in subjects 60 to 64 
years of age; and 10.5% to 16.2% among subjects ≥65 years of age. Limitation of arm movement 
was most frequently reported as mild, and was reported as severe in ≤3.1% of subjects in any study. 
Comparison of Reactions After 13vPnC in 23vPS-Naive and 23vPS-Preimmunized Subjects 
The incidence of most local reactions after vaccination with 13vPnC was similar between 23vPS-naive 
and 23vPS-preimmunized subjects of similar age (pre-immunized adults ≥68 years of age in studies 
6115A1-3000 and 6115A1-3005, and naive adults ≥65 years of age in study 6115A1-3008). The 
exception was pain, which was reported somewhat more often in pre-immunized subjects (51.0% to 
51.7%) than in 23vPS-naive subjects (41.7%). 
In study 6115A1-3000 all subjects enrolled had only a single prior dose of 23vPS. The incidences of 
local reactions in study 6115A1-3000 were similar to those in study 6115A1-3005, for which a single 
prior dose of 23vPS was a requirement. Overall, these results suggest that vaccination with 23vPS 3 to 
more than 5 years before vaccination with 13vPnC did not affect local reactogenicity observed after 
vaccination with 13vPnC, other than some increase in pain for 23vPnC-preimmunized subjects. 
Comparison of Reactions After 13vPnC in 23vPS-Naive and 23vPS-Preimmunized Subjects 
The incidence of most local reactions after vaccination with 13vPnC was similar between 23vPS-naive 
and 23vPS-pre-immunized subjects of similar age (pre-immunized adults ≥68 years of age in studies 
6115A1-3000 and 6115A1-3005, and naive adults ≥65 years of age in study 6115A1-3008). The 
exception was pain, which was reported somewhat more often in pre-immunized subjects (51.0% to 
51.7%) than in 23vPS-naive subjects (41.7%). 
In study 6115A1-3000 all subjects enrolled had only a single prior dose of 23vPS. The incidences of 
local reactions in study 6115A1-3000 were similar to those in study 6115A1-3005, for which a single 
CHMP variation assessment report

prior dose of 23vPS was a requirement. Overall, these results suggest that vaccination with 23vPS 3 to 
more than 5 years before vaccination with 13vPnC did not affect local reactogenicity observed after 
vaccination with 13vPnC, other than some increase in pain for 23vPnC-preimmunized subjects. 
13vPnC Compared With 23vPS in 23vPS-Naive Subjects 
In subjects 60 to 64 years of age and naive to 23vPS (studies 004 and 3010), redness, swelling, and 
limitation of arm movement were reported at similar incidences after vaccination with 13vPnC or 
23vPS. Pain was reported in both studies more frequently after vaccination with 13vPnC (80.1% and 
69.2%) than after vaccination with 23vPS (73.4% and 58.3%). 
Table 38.  Subjects Reporting Local Reactions Within 14 Days After an Initial Study Vaccination - 
Comparison of 13vPnC and 23vPS (Subjects Naive to 23vPS, 60-64 Years of Age) 
In study 004, the percentage of subjects reporting local reactions within 14 days after an initial study 
vaccination was slightly higher in the 13vPnC group than in the 23vPS group, respectively, for redness 
(20.2%, 14.2%), swelling (19.3%, 13.1%), and pain (80.1%, 73.4%), although the differences 
between groups were not statistically significant (Table 38). The percentage of subjects reporting 
limitation of arm movement was similar in the 13vPnC and 23vPS groups (28.5%, 30.8%, 
respectively). For all 4 reaction types, the majority of reports were mild. The incidence of mild pain 
was statistically significantly higher in the 13vPnC group (78.6%) than in the 23vPS group (68.6%) 
(p=0.005), while the incidence of severe pain was statistically significantly higher in the 23vPS group 
(8.6%) than in the 13vPnC group (1.7%) (p=0.003). For the other 3 reaction types, severe reactions 
were reported by ≤4.3% of subjects in either vaccine group.   
In study 3010, local reactions were reported at similar incidence in the 13vPnC and 23vPS groups, 
respectively, for redness (12.2%, 11.2%), swelling (10.0%, 10.4%), and limitation of arm movement 
(23.5%, 28.2%). Pain was reported more frequently by subjects receiving 13vPnC than among those 
vaccinated with 23vPS, both for any pain (69.2%, 58.3%; p=0.014) and for mild pain (66.1%, 52.9%; 
p=0.004), although the incidences of moderate pain and severe pain were similar between the 2 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 58/86
 
 
 
 
 
 
groups. For each of the 4 types of local reactions, the incidence of severe reports was ≤2.3% in each 
vaccine group.  
13vPnC Compared With 23vPS in 23vPS-Preimmunized Subjects 
In subjects ≥70 years of age who had previously received 1 dose of 23vPS at least 5 years before 
study entry (study 6115A1-3005), the incidences of redness, swelling, and limitation of arm movement 
were statistically significantly lower after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC than after 23vPS. The 
differences between the vaccine groups were also statistically significant at each severity level (mild, 
moderate, severe), except for mild redness. The incidence of pain was lower after 13vPnC than after 
23vPS, although the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance (p=0.062). 
The incidences reported for redness, swelling, and limitation of arm movement after 13vPnC ranged 
from 10.4% to 10.8%, and after 23vPS from 22.2% to 27.6%. Pain was the most frequently reported 
local reaction after 13vPnC (51.7%) and after 23vPS (58.5%) and was mostly mild (50.1% and 
54.1%, respectively). Moderate and severe pain were reported more frequently after 23vPS (23.6% 
and 2.3%) than after 13vPnC (7.5% and 1.3%). For each of the 4 types of local reactions, most 
reports were mild, and the incidence of severe reports was ≤4.8% in each vaccine group. 
13vPnC and 23vPS Administered in 2-Vaccine Sequences in 23vPS-Naïve Subjects 
The reactogenicity of subsequent study vaccinations of 13vPnC or 23vPS was evaluated in naïve 
subjects 60 to 64 years of age (study 3010) and in pre-immunized subjects≥70 years of age (study 
3005).  Study 3010 evaluated the reactogenicity of a subsequent study vaccination of 13vPnC or 
23vPSadministered 1 year after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC or 23vPS in naive subjects.  
Subjects 60 to 64 years of age were randomized to receive vaccine sequences as follows:13vPnC/ 
13vPnC, 13vPnC/23vPS, or 23vPS/13vPnC. 
Comparisons Between Initial and Subsequent Vaccinations of 13vPnC or 23vPS 
The incidence and severity of local reactions reported after a subsequent study vaccination (vaccination 
2) were evaluated by comparing them with those reported after an initial study vaccination 
(vaccination 1). Comparisons were made between: 
Vaccination 1    
Vaccination 2 
13vPnC  
13vPnC  
and  
13vPnC/13vPnC  
(intragroup comparison) 
            and  
23vPS/13vPnC              (intergroup comparison) 
23vPS                         and  
13vPnC/23vPS              (intergroup comparison) 
To compare the reactogenicity of an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC with the reactogenicity of a 
subsequent (second) vaccination of 13vPnC, data for subjects who received 2 vaccinations of 13vPnC 1 
year apart (13vPnC/13vPnC) were evaluated using intragroup analysis methods. 
Results of these analyses show that, among subjects who received both vaccinations, local reactions 
were reported at similar frequency after the initial vaccination and after the subsequent vaccination, 
respectively, for redness (14.8%, 11.5%), swelling (10.0%, 11.7%), pain(76.9%, 75.9%), and 
limitation of arm movement (26.2%, 24.6%). Most of the reactions were rated as mild, and for each 
type of reaction, the incidence of severe reports after each vaccination was ≤3.5%. 
In study 6115A1-3010, subjects 60 to 64 years of age naive to 23vPS received an initial dose of either 
13vPnC or 23vPS. Subjects who received 13vPnC were vaccinated 1 year later with either 13vPnC or 
23vPS (vaccine sequences designated as 13vPnC/13vPnC or 13vPnC/23vPS, respectively); and 
subjects who received 23vPS were vaccinated 1 year later with 13vPnC (23vPS/13vPnC).

For each of the 4 types of local reactions, the incidence of reports after the second vaccination of 
13vPnC was similar to the incidence observed after the initial vaccination of 13vPnC. Pain and 
limitation of arm movement were the 2 reaction types most frequently observed. After 13vPnC and 
13vPnC/13vPnC, respectively, pain was reported by 76.9% and 75.9% of subjects, and limitation of 
arm movement was reported by 26.2% and 24.6% of subjects. Redness and swelling ranged between 
10.0% and 14.8%. For each type of reaction, the incidence of severe reports after each vaccination 
was ≤3.5%. 
The frequencies of local reactions after 23vPS/13vPnC were similar to the frequencies after 13vPnC, 
except for redness, which was reported for 12.2% of subjects after 13vPnC compared to 4.3% after 
23vPS/13vPnC. Pain and limitation of arm movement were the 2 reaction types observed most 
frequently. After 13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC, respectively, pain was reported by 69.2% and 69.8% of 
subjects, and limitation of arm movement was reported by 23.5% and 18.5% of subjects. The 
incidence of redness and swelling ranged between 4.3% and 12.2%. For each reaction type, the 
incidence of severe reports after each vaccination was ≤2.3%  
All 4 reaction types were reported at statistically significantly higher incidence after 13vPnC/23vPS 
than after 23vPS alone. Pain and limitation of arm movement were the 2 reaction types reported most 
frequently. After 23vPS and after 13vPnC/23vPS, respectively, pain was reported by 58.3% compared 
to 85.7% of subjects, and limitation of arm movement was reported by 28.2% compared to 53.4% of 
subjects. Likewise, redness was reported by 11.2% compared to 27.8% of subjects, and swelling was 
reported by 10.4% compared to 25.8% of subjects, respectively. The highest incidence of severe 
reports was observed for severe pain after 13vPnC/23vPS (12.9%). 
After each of the 3 vaccine sequences (13vPnC/13vPnC, 13vPnC/23vPS, and 23vPS/13vPnC), pain at 
the injection site was reported most frequently, followed by limitation of arm movement, while redness 
and swelling were reported at lowest incidence. For each type of local reaction, the incidence of reports 
was highest for the sequence 13vPnC/23vPS, followed by 13vPnC/13vPnC, and lowest for 
23vPS/13vPnC. The incidence of pain, the most frequently reported local reaction, was lowest after 
23vPS/13vPnC (69.8%), and highest after 13vPnC/23vPS (85.7%). Limitation of arm movement was 
reported at lowest incidence after 23vPS/13vPnC (18.5%) and at highest incidence after 13vPnC/23vP 
(53.4%). Redness and swelling were reported at lowest incidence after 23vPS/13vPnC (4.3% and 
5.0%, respectively) and at highest incidence after 13vPnC/23vPS (27.8% and 25.8%, respectively). 
Severe reactions were most frequently reported after 13vPnC/23vPS, with 12.9% for pain and 8.1% 
for limitation of arm movement. 
13vPnC and 23vPS Administered in 2-Vaccine Sequences in 23vPS-Preimmunized Subjects 
In study 6115A1-3005, subjects ≥70 years of age pre-immunized with 1 dose of 23vPS 5 years or 
more prior to study entry received an initial study vaccination of either 13vPnC or 23vPS. One year 
later, all subjects received 1 dose of 13vPnC. 
For each of the 4 types of local reactions, the incidence of reports after the second vaccination of 
13vPnC (13vPnC/13vPnC) was similar to the incidence after the initial vaccination of 13vPnC. Pain was 
the most frequently reported local reaction after the initial dose of 13vPnC (55.0%) and after 
13vPnC/13vPnC (57.4%). The incidence of redness, swelling, and limitation of arm movement ranged 
between 9.2% and 13.3%. For each type of local reaction, the incidence of severe reports after each 
vaccination was ≤1.7%. 
All local reaction types were reported at similar frequency after the initial dose of 13vPnC and after 
23vPS/13vPnC, except for limitation of arm movement, which was statistically significantly higher after 
23vPS/13vPnC (19.9%) than after the initial vaccination of 13vPnC (10.5%). Pain was the most 
frequently reported local reaction, with an incidence of 51.7% after the initial vaccination of 13vPnC 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 60/86
 
 
 
 
and 56.6% after 23vPS/13vPnC. The incidence of redness and swelling ranged from 10.1% to 14.1%. 
For each type of local reaction, the incidence of severe reports after each vaccination was ≤1.7%. 
For each of the 4 types of local reactions, the incidence of reports after 13vPnC/13vPnC was similar to 
the incidence after 23vPS/13vPnC. Pain was the most frequently reported local reaction, with 58.2% 
after 13vPnC/13vPnC and 56.6% after 23vPS/13vPnC. Redness, swelling, and limitation of arm 
movement ranged between 10.1% and 19.9%. For each type of local reaction, the incidence of severe 
reports after each vaccination was ≤1.8%. 
13vPnC With Concomitant Administration of Trivalent Influenza Vaccine(TIV) 
In subjects 50 to 59 years of age naive to 23vPS (study 6115A1-3001), for each type of local reaction, 
the incidence of reports after concomitant administration of 13vPnC+TIV was similar to the incidence 
after 13vPnC administered alone. The 2 types of local reaction reported most frequently after 
13vPnC+TIV and after 13vPnC alone were pain (86.8% and 84.5%, respectively) and limitation of arm 
movement (35.6% and 42.5%, respectively). The incidence of redness and swelling ranged between 
12.1% and 18.4%. For each type of local reaction, the incidence of severe reports after each 
vaccination was ≤4.8%.  
In subjects ≥65 years of age naive to 23vPS (study 6115A1-3008), the incidence of each type of local 
reaction was similar after administration of 13vPnC+TIV and after 13vPnC administered alone. The 
local reaction reported most frequently after 13vPnC+TIV and after 13vPnC alone was pain (40.0% 
and 43.4%, respectively). The incidence of redness, swelling, and limitation of arm movement ranged 
between 10.2% and 16.6% after each vaccination. For each type of local reaction, the incidence of 
severe reports after each vaccination was ≤2.6%.  
Generally, incidences for redness and swelling were similar among subjects 50 to 59 years of age 
(study 6115A1-3001) and among subjects ≥65 years of age (study 6115A1-3008). However, pain and 
limitation of arm movement were reported more frequently in the younger age group compared to the 
older age group. After 13vPnC+TIV and after 13vPnC alone, respectively, the incidence of pain was 
86.8% and 84.5% among subjects 50 to 59 years of age, and was 40.0% and 43.4% among subjects 
≥65 years of age, while limitation of arm movement was reported for 35.6% and 42.5% of subjects in 
the younger age group, and for 13.9% and 14.8% of subjects in the older age group. The incidence of 
severe pain was ≤4.8% among subjects 50 to 59 years of age and ≤2.6% among subjects ≥65 years 
of age. The incidence of severe limitation of arm movement was ≤3.4% in the subjects 50 to 59 years 
of age and ≤1.9% among subjects ≥65 years of age. 
Conclusions: Local Reactions 
The described local safety data can be summarised as follows: 
After an Initial Vaccination of 13vPnC: 
 
 
Pain at the injection site was reported more frequently among subjects <65 years of age (69.2% 
to 88.8%) than among subjects ≥65 years of age (41.7% to 51.7%). 
The incidence of limitation of arm movement decreased with increasing age: 39.1% to40.7% 
among subjects 50 to 59 years of age; 23.5% to 28.5% among subjects 60 to6 years of age; 
and 10.5% to 16.2% among subjects ≥65 years of age. 
 
The incidence of reports varied across studies for redness (10.8% to 20.2%) and swelling 
(10.0% to 21.7%), with no consistent trends related to subject age. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 61/86
 
 
 
 
 
In subjects ≥65 years of age, the incidence of each type of local reaction among subjects 
previously vaccinated with 23vPS (3 to 5 years before study entry) was generally similar to that 
among subjects naive to 23vPS. 
After an Initial Vaccination of 13vPnC or 23vPS: 
 
In subjects 60 to 64 years of age and naive to 23vPS, in both studies, there were no statistically 
significant differences between groups in the incidence of any of the 4 types of local reactions, 
except for pain, which was reported more frequently after vaccination with 13vPnC (69.2%) than 
after 23vPS (58.3%) (p=0.014) in study 3010. 
 
In pre-immunized subjects ≥70 years of age, the incidences of redness, swelling, and limitation 
of arm movement were statistically significantly higher after an initial study vaccination of 23vPS 
than after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC (p<0.001), while the incidence of pain was 
slightly higher in the 23vPS group (58.5%) than in the 13vPnCgroup (51.7%) (p=0.062). 
After a Subsequent Study Vaccination of 13vPnC or 23vPS: 
In subjects 60 to 64 years of age naive to 23vPS: comparison of results between initial and subsequent 
study vaccinations shows that, for all 4 types of local reactions: 
 
In subjects who received 2 vaccinations of 13vPnC 1 year apart (13vPnC/13vPnC),and in 
subjects who received 23vPS followed by 13vPnC 1 year later (23vPS/13vPnC), the incidence 
and severity of local reactions reported after the subsequent vaccination of 13vPnC were no 
greater than those reported after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC; and 
 
In subjects who received 13vPnC followed by 23vPS 1 year later (13vPnC/23vPS), the incidence 
and severity of local reactions reported after the subsequent vaccination of 23vPS were 
statistically significantly greater than those reported after an initial study vaccination of 23vPS. 
Comparison of results between subsequent study vaccinations shows that, for each of the 4 
types of local reactions: 
 
 
The incidence of reports after vaccination 2 was statistically significantly higher among subjects 
receiving 13vPnC/23vPS than among those receiving 13vPnC/13vPnC or 23vPS/13vPnC; and 
The incidence of reports after vaccination 2 was higher in the 13vPnC/13vPnC group than in the 
23vPS/13vPnC group, although the differences between the groups were significant only for 
redness and for swelling. 
In subjects ≥70 years of age who had received 1 dose of 23vPS at least 5 years before enrolment: 
Comparison of results between initial and subsequent study vaccinations shows that: 
 
In subjects who received 2 vaccinations of 13vPnC 1 year apart (13vPnC/13vPnC) the incidence 
and severity of all 4 types of local reactions reported after the subsequent vaccination of 13vPnC 
were similar to those reported after the initial study vaccination of 13vPnC; and 
 
In subjects who received 23vPS followed by 13vPnC 1 year later (23vPS/13vPnC), the incidence 
and severity of redness, swelling, and pain reported after the subsequent vaccination of 13vPnC 
were similar to those reported after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC, while the incidence of 
limitation of arm movement was statistically significantly higher after vaccination 2 of 
23vPS/13vPnC (19.9%) than after the initial dose of 13vPnC (10.5%). 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 62/86
 
 
 
 
Comparison of results between subsequent study vaccinations shows that: 
 
For all 4 types of local reactions, the incidence and severity reported after vaccination 2 were 
similar in the 23vPS/13vPnC group and the 13vPnC/13vPnC group. 
Concomitant Administration of 13vPnC and TIV: 
 
In naive subjects 50 to 59 years of age, and in naive subjects ≥65 years of age, the incidence 
and severity of each of the 4 types of local reactions after administration of 13vPnC+TIV were 
were similar to those after 13vPnC alone. 
Systemic Events 
All reports of fever >40°C (>104°F) in all studies were confirmed to be e-diary data entry errors, 
except for 1 confirmed temperature of 104.4°F reported by 1 subject in study 6115A1-3005 after 
13vPnC/13vPnC (vaccination 2). These erroneous reports are flagged as data entry errors in the SCS 
summary tables, but are not subtracted from the overall number of reports of “any fever”. Therefore 
the overall incidences of fever shown in the tables are somewhat higher than the actual values. To 
achieve a more realistic estimate for the incidence of fever in each study, post hoc analyses were 
conducted in which the erroneous values were excluded.   
13vPnC in 23vPS-Naive and 23vPS-Preimmunized Subjects Across Studies 
The incidence of systemic events reported within 14 days after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC 
was assessed in 6 studies. The incidence of fever (ie, temperature ≥38°C) was similar across the 
studies, ranging from 1.0% (study 6115A1-3005) to 7.7% (study 6115A1-004-cohort 1, subjects 60 to 
64 years of age) However, study 6115A1-004 had a large number of e-diary data entry errors. Results 
of the post-hoc analyses (excluding erroneous values) showed that, after in initial vaccination of 
13vPnC, the incidence of fever ranged from 1.0% (in study 6115A1-3005) to 4.2% (study 6115A1-
3010), with no apparent difference among the various age groups. All other types of systemic events 
were consistently reported at lower incidences in subjects ≥65 years of age than in younger subjects. 
Among all age groups, the systemic events reported most frequently were fatigue, headache, and new 
generalized muscle pain. (Table 39)

Table 39.  Subjects Reporting Systemic Events Within 14 Days After an Initial Study Vaccination of 
13vPnC, by Immunization Status and Age 
The incidence of most systemic events was similar between naive and pre-immunized subjects of 
similar age (naive subjects ≥65 years in study 6115A1-3008; pre-immunized subjects ≥68 years in 
study 6115A1-3000 and ≥70 years in study 6115A1-3005). One exception was new muscle pain, 
which was reported more frequently among pre-immunized subjects in study 6115A1-3005 (36.8%) 
than among naive subjects in study 6115A1-3008 (23.4%). However, the incidence in pre-immunized 
subjects in study 6115A1-3000 (25.3%) was similar to that in naive subjects. 
13vPnC Compared With 23vPS in 23vPS-Naive Subjects 
In subjects 60 to 64 years of age and naive to 23vPS, all types of systemic events, including fever, 
were reported at similar incidences after vaccination with 13vPnC or 23vPS, except decreased 
appetite, aggravated generalized muscle pain, and new generalized joint pain, which were reported 
more frequently after 23vPS in study 6115A1-3010 (Table 40).

Table 40.  Subjects Reporting Systemic Events Within 14 Days After an Initial Study Vaccination – 
Comparison of 13vPnC and 23vPS (Subjects Naive to 23vPS, 60-64 Years of Age) 
13vPnC Compared With 23vPS in 23vPS-Preimmunized Subjects 
In subjects ≥70 years of age who had previously received 1 dose of 23vPS at least 5 years before 
study entry, the incidence of most systemic events was similar after an initial study vaccination of 
13vPnC or 23vPS, except for fatigue, rash, new generalized muscle pain, and aggravated generalized 
muscle pain, which were reported at statistically higher incidence after 23vPS compared with 13vPnC 
(table 2-14). After removing e-diary data entry errors from the analysis the incidence of fever >38°C 
was similar after 13vPnC (1.0%) and after 23vPS (2.3%). 
13vPnC and 23vPS Administered as a 2-Vaccine Sequence in 23vPS-Naïve Subjects 
Systemic events were assessed in adults 60 to 64 years of age naive to 23vPS. Subjects received an 
initial dose of either 13vPnC or 23vPS. 13vPnC recipients were vaccinated 1 year later with either 
13vPnC or 23vPS. 23vPS recipients were vaccinated 1 year later with 13vPnC. 
Comparing systemic events reported after the initial study dose of 13vPnC with those reported after 
the second study vaccination of 13vPnC 1 year later (13vPnC/13vPnC), all types of systemic events 
were reported at similar frequencies, including  fever, which was reported in 9.1% after 13vPnC alone 
and 3.6% after 13vPnC/13vPnC. All occurrences of fever were either mild or moderate. The most 
frequently reported types of systemic events after 13vPnC and 13vPnC/13vPnC were fatigue, 
headache, and new generalized muscle pain. 
Comparing systemic events after 13vPnC and after 23vPS/13vPnC, all types of systemic events were 
reported at similar frequencies, including fever, in 4.6% of subjects after 13vPnC alone and 0.9% of 
subjects after 23vPS/13vPnC. All occurrences of fever were either mild or moderate, except 1 case of 
severe fever (≥39°C but ≤40°C) after 13vPnC alone. Medication to treat fever was used more 
frequently after 23vPS/13vPnC vaccination 2 than after 13vPnC vaccination 1 (19.4% and 8.6%). The 
most frequently reported types of systemic events after 13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC were fatigue, 
headache, and new generalized muscle pain. 
Comparing systemic events after 23vPS with those reported after 13vPnC/23vPS, most types of 
systemic events were reported at similar frequencies after the initial dose and after the second dose, 
CHMP variation assessment report

except for rash, which was reported more frequently after 13vPnC/23vPS (24.0%) than after 23vPS 
(13.4%) (p=0.025). Fever was reported in 1.6% of subjects after 23vPS alone and in 3.1% after 
13vPnC/23vPS. All occurrences of fever were either mild or moderate, except 1 severe fever (≥39°C 
but ≤40°C) after 23vPS alone. The most frequently reported types of systemic events after 23vPS and 
13vPnC/23vPS were fatigue, headache, and new generalized muscle pain. 
Comparisons Between Subsequent Vaccinations of 13vPnC or 23vPS 
Table 2-18 summarizes the results of analyses comparing the incidence of systemic events after 
subsequent vaccinations of 13vPnC or 23vPS (ie, after vaccination 2 of the 13vPnC/13vPnC, 
13vPnC/23vPS, and 23vPS/13vPnC regimens). After excluding erroneous values from the analysis, 
fever was reported at similar incidence after 13vPnC/13vPnC (1.3%), 13vPnC/23vPS (3.1%), and 
23vPS/13vPnC (0.9%) (p=0.514).  For most types of systemic events, the incidence was highest after 
13vPnC/23vPS; however, differences among the 3 groups were statistically significant for only 3 types 
of events: rash, new generalized muscle pain, and aggravated generalized muscle pain. The use of 
medication to treat pain was also reported most frequent after 13vPnC/23vPS (p<0.001). Fever, 
vomiting, decreased appetite, and aggravated generalized joint pain were reported at similar incidence 
among the 3 groups. Pairwise comparisons showed no statistically significant differences between the 
13vPnC/13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC groups in the incidence of any systemic events. 
Comparing systemic events after the 3 vaccine sequences (13vPnC/13vPnC, 13vPnC/23vPS, 
23vPS/13vPnC), the incidences for all types of systemic events were similar except for rash, which was 
highest after 13vPnC/23vPS (24%), followed by 13vPnC/13vPnC (10.5%) and 23vPS/13vPnC (8.3%); 
new generalized muscle pain, which was highest after 13vPnC/23vPS (61.2%), followed by 
13vPnC/13vPnC (50%) and 23vPS/13vPnC (45%); and aggravated generalized muscle pain, which was 
highest after 13vPnC/23vPS (41.5%), followed by 23vPS/13vPnC (28.7%) and 13vPnC/13vPnC 
(26.6%). Fever was similar after all 3 sequences, with 2.5% after 13vPnC/13vPnC, 3.1% after 
13vPnC/23vPS, and 0.9% after 23vPS/13vPnC. All occurrences of fever were either mild or moderate  
13vPnC and 23vPS Administered as a 2-Vaccine Sequence in 23vPS-Preimmunized Subjects 
In study 6115A1-3005, systemic events were assessed in adults ≥70 years of age pre-immunized with 
23vPS at least 5 years previously. Subjects received an initial dose of either 13vPnC or 23vPS, and all 
subjects were vaccinated 1 year later with 13vPnC (vaccine sequences of 13vPnC/13vPnC or 
23vPS/13vPnC). Comparing systemic events after the initial dose of 13vPnC and the subsequent dose 
of 13vPnC (13vPnC/13vPnC), all types of systemic events were reported at similar frequencies, except 
for chills, which was reported more often after 13vPnC (9.3%) than after 13vPnC/13vPnC (4.4%) 
(95% CI on the difference: -9.6, -0.2). Fever was reported by 1.7% of subjects after 13vPnC alone 
and by 2.2% after 13vPnC/13vPnC. After 13vPnC, all occurrences of fever were mild, while after 
13vPnC/13vPnC, 1 subject reported severe fever (≥39°C but ≤40°C) and 1 subject had a confirmed 
report of a temperature of 40°C on day 2 after vaccination. The most frequently reported types of 
systemic events after both13vPnC and 13vPnC/13vPnC were new generalized muscle pain and fatigue.  
Comparing systemic events after 13vPnC and after 23vPS/13vPnC, all types of systemic events were 
reported at similar frequencies, including fever, which was reported in 1% of subjects after 13vPnC 
alone and in 2.2% after 23vPS/13vPnC. In both groups, most cases of fever were mild. After 
13vPnC/13vPnC, 1 case of severe fever was reported. Medication to treat fever was reported more 
frequently after 23vPS/13vPnC (7.4%) than after 13vPnC (3%). The most frequently reported types of 
systemic events after 13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC were new generalized muscle pain and fatigue. 
Comparing systemic events after 13vPnC/13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC, all types of systemic events 
were reported at similar frequencies, including fever, which was reported in 3.5% of subjects after 
CHMP variation assessment report

13vPnC/13vPnC and in 2.2% after 23vPS/13vPnC; most reports of fever were mild or moderate. The 
most frequently reported types of systemic events in both study groups were new generalized muscle 
pain and fatigue. 
13vPnC With Concomitant Administration of Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV) 
After concomitant administration of 13vPnC+TIV in subjects 50 to 59 years of age (study 6115A1-
3005) administered alone, except for a statistically higher frequency of headache after13vPnC+TIV 
(65.9%) than after 13vPnC alone (50.9%). The most frequently observed systemic reactions (after 
13vPnC+TIV and after 13vPnC alone, respectively) were headache (65.9% and 50.9%), new muscle 
pain (65.5% and 59.1%), and fatigue (58.1% and 51.8%). Fever was reported in 3.4% of subjects 
after 13vPnC+TIV and in 2.5% of subjects after 13vPnC alone, most incidences being mild or moderate  
In subjects ≥65 years of age (study 6115A1-3008), several types of systemic events were reported at 
significantly higher incidence after concomitant administration of 13vPnC+TIV than after 13vPnC 
alone; these were, respectively, fatigue (37.4% and 28.5%), headache (32.6% and 24.7%), chills 
(13.8% and 9.1%), decreased appetite (16.9% and 11.3%), new joint pain (16.2% and 11.5%), and 
aggravated generalized joint pain (15.7% and 8.6%). Fatigue, headache, and new muscle pain (26.9% 
and 23.4%) were the most frequently reported systemic events in each vaccine group. Fever was 
reported in 5.3% of subjects after 13vPnC+TIV and 4.2% of subjects after 13vPnC alone. All 
occurrences of fever were mild or moderate.  
After either 13vPnC+TIV and after 13vPnC alone, incidences for all types of systemic events were 
higher in the younger (50 to 59 years) compared with the older age group (≥65 years), except for 
fever, which was similar in both age group. 
The incidence of systemic events reported after 13vPnC+TIV was also compared with the incidence 
after TIV + placebo (referred to hereafter as “TIV alone”). In subjects 50 to 59 years of age, most 
systemic events were reported at statistically significantly higher incidence after 13vPnC+TIV than 
after TIV alone, except for fatigue, vomiting, and aggravated generalized joint pain, which were similar 
in both groups. The incidence of systemic events after 13vPnC+TIV ranged from 5.3% (vomiting) to 
65.9% (headache), and after TIV alone from 3.4% (vomiting) to 56.5% (headache). The most 
frequently reported systemic events after administration of 13vPnC+TIV and after TIV alone were, 
respectively, headache (65.9% and 56.5%), new muscle pain (65.5% and 37.7%), and fatigue. 
In subjects ≥65 years of age, similar frequencies for all systemic reactions were observed after 
concomitant administration of 13vPnC+TIV, compared with TIV administered alone, except for chills 
(13.8% and 9.1%), rash (6.9% and 3.4%) and new muscle pain (26.9% and 16.7%), which were 
reported at statistically significantly higher incidence after 13vPnC+TIV than after TIV alone. The most 
frequently reported types of systemic events after 13vPnC+TIV and after TIV alone were, respectively, 
fatigue (37.4% and 31.9%), headache (32.6% and 29.7%), and new muscle pain (26.9% and 16.7%). 
Fever was reported at similar incidence in both groups, with 5.3% after 13vPnC+TIV and 5.0% after 
TIV alone. Most occurrences of fever were mild to moderate. 
Conclusions: Systemic Events 
The described systemic safety data can be summarised as follows: 
After an Initial Study Vaccination of 13vPnC: 
 
 
Fever was reported at similar incidence and severity across studies, regardless of subject age. 
With the exception of fever, all types of systemic events were, in general, reported more 
frequently among subjects 50 to 64 years of age than among subjects ≥65 years of age. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 67/86
 
 
 
 
 
Among subjects ≥65 years of age, the incidence of fever and other types of systemic events 
was, in general, similar between naive subjects and pre-immunized subjects. 
After an Initial Study Vaccination of 13vPnC or 23vPS: 
In subjects 60 to 64 years of age and naive to 23vPS: 
 
Most types of systemic events were reported at similar incidence after administration of 13vPnC 
or 23vPS. In one study, the incidences of new generalized joint pain, aggravated generalized 
muscle pain, decreased appetite, and use of medication to treat fever were statistically 
significantly higher in the 23vPS group than in the 13vPnC group. 
 
After administration of either 13vPnC or 23vPS, the most frequently reported types of systemic 
events (>45% of subjects) were fatigue, headache, and new generalized muscle pain. 
In pre-immunized subjects ≥70 years of age: 
 
Most types of systemic events were reported at similar incidence after administration of 13vPnC 
or 23vPS, although fatigue, rash, new generalized muscle pain, and aggravated generalized 
muscle pain were reported at statistically higher incidence after administration of 23vPS than 
after 13vPnC. 
 
After administration of either 13vPnC or 23vPS, the most frequently reported types of systemic 
events (>20% of subjects) were fatigue, headache, new generalized muscle pain, aggravated 
generalized muscle pain, and use of medication to treat pain. 
After a Subsequent Study Vaccination of 13vPnC or 23vPS: 
In naive subjects 60 to 64 years of age: 
Comparison of results between initial and subsequent study vaccinations shows that: 
 
When 13vPnC was administered as a subsequent study vaccination one year after an initial study 
vaccination of either 13vPnC (13vPnC/13vPnC) or 23vPS (23vPS/13vPnC), the incidence of each 
type of systemic event after vaccination 2 was similar to or lower than that observed after the 
initial study vaccination of 13vPnC. 
 
However, the use of medication to treat fever was reported at statistically significantly higher 
incidence after 13vPnC/13vPnC and after 23vPS/13vPnC than after the initial vaccination of 
13vPnC. 
 
When 23vPS was administered as a subsequent study vaccination one year after an initial study 
vaccination of 13vPnC (13vPnC/23vPS), the incidence of each type of systemic event after 
vaccination 2 was similar to that observed after an initial study vaccination of 23vPS, except for 
rash, which was reported at statistically significantly higher incidence after 13vPnC/23vPS than 
after an initial vaccination of 23vPS. The incidence of the use of medication to treat pain was 
also statistically significantly higher after 13vPnC/23vPS than after 23vPS. 
Comparison of results between subsequent study vaccinations shows that: 
 
After administration of vaccination 2 of 13vPnC/23vPS, 13vPnC/13vPnC, or 23vPS/13vPnC, most 
types of systemic events were reported at highest incidence after 13vPnC/23vPS, although 
differences among the groups were statistically significant only for rash, new generalized muscle 
pain, and aggravated muscle pain, as well as for the use of medication to treat pain. Fever, 
vomiting, decreased appetite, and aggravated generalized joint pain were reported at similar 
incidence among the 3 groups, as was the use of medication to treat fever. 
 
After vaccination with 13vPnC/13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC, pairwise comparison showed no 
statistically significant differences between the groups in the incidence of any systemic event. 
CHMP variation assessment report

In pre-immunized subjects ≥70 years of age: 
Comparison of results between initial and subsequent study vaccinations of 13vPnC shows 
that: 
 
When 13vPnC was administered as a subsequent study vaccination one year after an initial study 
vaccination of either 13vPnC (13vPnC/13vPnC) or 23vPS (23vPS/13vPnC), the incidence of each 
type of systemic event after vaccination 2 was similar to or lower than that observed after the 
initial study vaccination of 13vPnC. However, the use of medication to treat fever was 
significantly higher after 23vPS/13vPnC compared to 13vPnC. 
Comparison of results between subsequent study vaccinations shows that: 
 
After vaccination 2 of 13vPnC/13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC, all types of systemic events were 
reported at similar incidence in the 2 groups. Although the incidence of vomiting was statistically 
significantly higher after 23vPS/13vPnC than after 13vPnC/13vPnC, the actual difference in the 
percentage of subjects reporting the event was small (3.1% versus 0.4%) and was not 
considered clinically meaningful. 
 
After vaccination 2 of 13vPnC/13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC, the most frequently reported types of 
systemic events were fatigue, headache, new generalized muscle pain, and aggravated 
generalized muscle pain; and the use of medication to treat pain was also reported frequently. 
After Concomitant Administration of 13vPnC and TIV: 
 
Both in younger subjects (50 to 59 years of age) and in older subjects (≥65 years of age), fever 
≥38°C was reported infrequently and at similar incidence after concomitant administration of 
13vPnC+TIV compared with 13vPnC alone or TIV alone (≤5.3% after any vaccination). 
 
Both in younger subjects (50 to 59 years of age) and in older subjects (≥65 years the systemic 
events reported most frequently after administration of 13vPnC+TIV, 13vPnC alone, or TIV alone 
were fatigue, headache, and new generalized muscle pain. 
 
Among younger subjects (50 to 59 years of age), the incidence of systemic events reported after 
concomitant administration of 13vPnC+TIV was similar to the incidence after 13vPnC+TIV than 
after TIV alone. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
AEs occurring within 1 month after vaccination (ie, from vaccination to the postvaccination visit) were 
summarized separately for each vaccine (ie, separately for dose 1 and dose 2 in studies 3001 and 
3008, and separately for vaccination 1 and vaccination 2 in studies 3005 and 3010). AEs occurring 
from the postvaccination visit to the 6-month follow-up contact were also summarized separately for 
each vaccine. Statistical analyses compared the incidence of AEs between vaccine groups.  
Adverse Events After 13vPnC Across Studies 
The incidence of AEs reported within 1 month after an initial study vaccination with 13vPnC was similar 
across all 6 studies, ranging from 11.4% to 19.2%, and did not appear to be affected by subject age or 
23vPS immunization status (ie, naive or prei-mmunized subjects). The overall incidence of AEs 
occurring after administration of 13vPnC in subjects 50 to 64 years of age (studies 004, 3001, 3010) 
was similar to the incidence in subjects ≥65 years of age (studies 3000, 3005, 3008). Likewise, the 
incidence of AEs in subjects naive to 23vPS (studies 004, 3001, 3008, 3010) was similar to the 
incidence in subjects who had received 23vPS at least 3 years prior to study entry (Table 41). 
Across the studies, the types of AEs reported most frequently were infections and infestations (3.3% to 
8.6% of subjects), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (1.6% to 4.1%), general disorders 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 69/86
 
 
 
 
and administration site conditions (0.6% to 3.1%), gastrointestinal disorders (0.5% to 2.6%), and 
respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (0.4% to 2.3%). There were no apparent differences in 
the incidence or types of AEs reported among the various age groups. In all studies, the AEs reported 
were generally the types of diseases and conditions often observed in adults in these age groups. 
AEs occurring after administration of 13vPnC and considered at least possibly related to study vaccine 
were also reported at similar frequencies across the 6 primary studies (1.1% to 3.1% of subjects) 
regardless of subject age or 23vPS vaccination status. The types of AEs most often reported as related 
to study vaccine were administration site conditions. 
Only serious AEs (SAEs) and newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions were to be reported at the 6-
month follow-up telephone contact. In studies that enrolled subjects <65 years of age, the percentage 
of subjects reporting AEs at the 6-month follow-up ranged from 1.5% to 10.7%. Among older subjects, 
the incidence was 10.2% in study 6115A1-3000 (subjects ≥68 years) and was 17.3% in study 
6115A1-3005 (subjects ≥70 years). The somewhat higher incidence of AEs observed among older 
subjects (especially in study 6115A1-3005) was associated with a greater variety in the types of AEs 
reported. Differences in AE reporting between younger subjects (50 to 64 years of age) and older 
subjects (≥68 years of age) were discernable within certain SOCs (eg, cardiac disorders, and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and others). These trends are consistent with the 
increase in the incidence of serious medical disorders and conditions associated with increasing age in 
the general population . 
Two (2) AEs reported at the 6-month follow-up contact were considered related to study vaccine: 
One case with arthralgia, bursitis, and tendonitis, and one case of Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
Adverse Events Considered Related to Study Vaccine 
AEs occurring after administration of an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC and considered by the 
investigator at least possibly related to study vaccine were reported at similar frequencies across the 6 
studies (1.1% to 3.1% of subjects) regardless of subject age or 23vPS vaccination status. The types of 
AEs most often reported as related to study vaccine were administration site conditions 
The incidence of AEs was similar across all 6 primary studies, ranging from 11.4% to 19.2%, and did 
not appear to be affected by subject age or 23vPS immunization status (ie, naive or pre-immunized 
subjects). The overall incidence of AEs occurring after administration of 13vPnC in studies that enrolled 
subjects 50 to 64 years of age (studies 004, 3001, 3010) was similar to the incidence in 
studies that enrolled subjects ≥65 years of age (studies 3000, 3005, 3008). Likewise, the incidence of 
AEs in studies that enrolled subjects naive to 23vPS (studies 004, 3001, 3008, 3010) was similar to 
the incidence in studies that enrolled subjects who had received 23vPS at least 3 years prior to study 
entry (studies 3000 and 3005 - Table 41) 
In naive subjects 60 to 64 years old and in 23vPS-preimmunized subjects ≥70 years old, the incidence 
of related AEs after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC was similar to the incidence after 23vPS.

a. For studies 3001 and 3008, data are shown for dose 2 of the Placebo +TIV/13vPnC sequence group only 
b. For studies 3005 and 3010, data are shown for vaccination 1(year 0) only. 
In both 23vPS-naive and 23vPS-preimmunized subjects, related AEs were reported at similar incidence 
after vaccination 2 of either 13vPnC/13vPnC or 23vPS/13vPnC (0.6% to 2.6% of subjects) When 
13vPnC was administered concomitantly with TIV, related AEs were somewhat more frequent in the 
younger age group (50 to 59 years of age; 3.1%) than in the older age group (≥65 years of age; 
1.7%). Overall, incidences of related AEs after 13vPnC+TIV were low and represented events that are 
commonly associated with vaccination. 
The incidence of AEs and related AEs reported within 1 month after the subsequent vaccination 
(vaccination 2) was similar in the 13vPnC/13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC groups (Table 42)

There were no statistically significant differences between the regimens in the incidence of any 
specific type of AE (SOCs or preferred terms) The incidence of AEs reported at the 6-month follow-up 
contact after vaccination 2 was also similar in the 2 vaccine groups . After 13vPnC/13vPnC, the most 
frequently reported types of AEs at the 6-month follow-up were neoplasms (1.8%) and nervous 
system disorders (1.8%), and after 23vPS/13vPnC, the most frequent were neoplasms (1.7%) and 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 71/86
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infections and infestations (1.7%) The incidence of AEs classified as respiratory, thoracic, and 
mediastinal disorders was significantly higher among subjects who had received 23vPS/13vPnC 
(1.5%) than among subjects who had received 13vPnC/13vPnC (0.0%) (p=0.016). The respiratory AEs 
reported in the 23vPS/13vPnC group included sleep apnea. 
AEs reported at the 6-month follow-up contact after vaccination were seldom considered related to 
study vaccine. One (1) case of Guillain Barré syndrome developed on day 123 after 13vPnC, and was 
ongoing at the 6-month follow-up contact. The other cases reported were 1 case of cutaneous lupus 
erythematosus after vaccination with 23vPS, 1 case of injection site nodule after 13vPnC+TIV, 1 case 
of erythema after 23vPS/13vPnC, and 1 case of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after 
23vPS/13vPnC ongoing at the 6-month follow-up contact. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
During the study period, death occurred in 16 subjects in the 6 studies. Nine (9) of the 16 cases 
occurred in study 6115A1-3005, a study that enrolled subjects ≥70 years of age. None of the deaths 
was considered vaccine-related. Overall, the observed number of 16 deaths out of over 6000 subjects 
vaccinated is low. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) reported within 1 month after an initial study 
vaccination of 13vPnC was low, ranging between 0.2% and 1.1%, with no apparent differences among 
age groups or between 23vPS-naive and 23vPS-preimmunized subjects. 
In both naïve and in pre-immunised subjects the incidence and type of SAEs reported within a month 
of vaccination with 13vPnC were similar to those reported after 23vPS. 
There were no clinically important differences between the incidence and types of SAEs reported within 
1 month after vaccination 2 of the vaccine sequences 13vPnC/13vPnC, 13vPnC/ 23vPS, or 
23vPS/13vPnC, compared with those after initial doses of 13vPnC or 23vPS SAEs reported within 1 
month after 13vPnC+TIV were similar to those reported after 13vPnC alone and after TIV alone.  
After an initial vaccination of 13vPnC, the incidence of SAEs reported at the 6-month follow-up contact 
was slightly lower among subjects 50 to 59 years of age (1.2% to 1.8%) than among subjects 60 to 
64 years of age (2.9% to 3.1%), and was highest among subjects ≥65 years of age (3.9% to 5.8%). 
Most notably, cardiac disorders and cerebrovascular (nervous system) events, neoplasms, respiratory 
disorders, and injuries occurred more frequently among subjects ≥65 years of age than among 
younger subjects. There were no clinically meaningful differences between vaccine groups in the 
incidence or types of SAEs reported at the 6-month follow-up contacts after either initial or subsequent 
study vaccinations  
Two (2) of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to the study 
vaccine. In the first case, a 78-year-old female subject developed Guillain-Barré-syndrome on day 123 
after vaccination with 13vPnC. Other possible risk factors included vaccination with influenza vaccine 
on day 29 after vaccination with 13vPnC, and an infectious origin (varicella zoster was suspected but 
not confirmed) (study 3000). In the second case, an 81-year-old male subject was diagnosed with 
idiopathic thrombocyto- penic purpura (ITP) 133 days after receiving vaccination 2 in the vaccination 
sequence 23vPS/13vPnC (study 3005)

Withdrawals and Vaccination Discontinuations 
A total of 16 subjects were withdrawn from the studies because of AEs. Among the subjects with-
drawn because of AEs, 6 had received 13vPnC, 9 had received 23vPS, and 1 had received 
TIV+placebo. The type of AE most frequently resulting in withdrawal was cancer. 
All AEs reported during the 6 adult studies were reviewed to identify any additional ADRs. Criteria 
included the frequency of occurrence, the finding of a statistically significant difference in incidence 
between the 13vPnC and 23vPS groups, and the theoretical existence of a biologic mechanism by 
which the AE could be causally related to 13vPnC. 
ADRs Determined for 13vPnC Adult 
A trend towards fewer AEs was seen in subjects who were older (≥65 years old); however, the CIOMS 
category for each of the events was the same as that for younger subjects. No differences in 
frequencies of AEs were noted whether13vPnC was given as a first or as a second dose. 
In studies 004 and 3010, a direct comparison was made with 23vPS, and no major differences were 
seen between the 2 vaccines. 
Adverse drug reactions are listed in Table 5-1 in CIOMS frequency categories: 
Very common: ≥10% 
Common: ≥1% and <10% 
Uncommon: ≥0.1% and <1% 
Rare: ≥0.01% and <0.1% 
Very rare: <0.01%

Conclusions: Adverse Events 
The provided data can be concluded as follows: 
In all studies, the AEs reported were generally the types of diseases and conditions often 
observed in adults over 50 years of age. 
After an Initial Study Vaccination of 13vPnC: 
 
The incidence of AEs occurring within approximately 1 month after vaccination was similar across 
all 6 primary studies, ranging from 11.4% to 19.2%, and did not appear to be affected by 
subject age or 23vPS immunization status (ie, in naive or pre-immunized subjects). 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported types of AEs were generally infections and infestations (3.3% to 
8.6%) and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (1.6% to 4.1%). 
Few AEs were considered related to study vaccine. Related AEs were reported for 1.1% to 3.1% 
of subjects, and most were administration site conditions. 
At the 6-month follow-up contact, where only serious AEs and newly diagnosed medical 
conditions were to be reported, the percentage of subjects reporting AEs was lower among 
subjects <65 years of age (1.5% to 10.7%) than among subjects ≥65 years of age (10.2% to 
17.3%). 
After an Initial Study Vaccination of 13vPnC or 23vPS: 
In subjects 60 to 64 years of age naive to 23vPS, and in subjects ≥70 years of age who had received 
23vPS at least 5 years before study entry: 
 
The incidence and types of AEs reported after administration of 13vPnC were, in general, similar 
to those observed after the administration of 23vPS, and few AEs were considered related to 
study vaccine. 
 
There were some statistically significant differences between the 13vPnC and 23vPS vaccine 
groups in the incidence of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. However, the data 
were inconsistent between studies and do not suggest an increased incidence of these types of 
AEs after administration of 13vPnC relative to 23vPS. Further, there are no patterns suggestive 
of inflammatory arthritis. 
After a Subsequent Study Vaccination of 13vPnC or 23vPS: 
In naive subjects 60 to 64 years of age: 
 
The incidence and types of AEs reported after administration of 13vPnC were similar, in general, 
whether the vaccine was administered as an initial study vaccination or as a subsequent study 
vaccination 1 year after an initial study vaccination of either 13vPnC or23vPS. Similarly, the 
incidence and types of AEs reported after administration of 23vPS as a subsequent study 
vaccination 1 year after 13vPnC were generally similar to those observed after an initial study 
vaccination of 23vPS. There were no clinically important differences in the incidence and types of 
AEs between the groups compared. 
In pre-immunized subjects ≥70 years of age: 
 
The incidence and types of AEs reported after administration of 13vPnC were similar, in general, 
whether the vaccine was administered as an initial vaccination or as a subsequent study 
vaccination 1 year after an initial study vaccination of either 13vPnC or 23vPS.

After Concomitant Administration of 13vPnC and TIV: 
 
13vPnC+TIV versus 13vPnC alone: In subjects 50 to 59 years of age, the percentage of subjects 
reporting any adverse event within 1 month after vaccination was significantly higher after 
13vPnC+TIV (16.7%) than after 13vPnC alone (11.8%) (p=0.020), while in subjects ≥65 years 
of age, the incidence of any AE was similar in the 2 groups. In both studies, there were no other 
medically important differences between the groups in the incidence and types of AEs reported 
after administration of 13vPnC+TIV as compared with 13vPnC alone. 
 
13vPnC+TIV versus TIV alone: In both studies, the percentage of subjects reporting an adverse 
event within 1 month after vaccination was similar after 13vPnC+TIV and after TIV alone. In 
subjects ≥65 years of age, the percentage of subjects reporting any AE considered related to 
study vaccine was significantly higher after 13vPnC+TIV (1.7%) than after TIV alone (0.2%) 
(p=0.006), although the actual difference in incidence was small and not clinically significant. 
 
In subjects 50 to 59 years of age, the incidence of AEs classified as musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders was significantly higher after 13vPnC+TIV (2.7%) than after TIV 
alone (0.9%) (p=0.022), while in subjects ≥65 years of age, the incidence of musculoskeletal 
AEs was similar between the groups (approximately 2% in each). 
 
There were no other medically important differences between the groups in the incidence and 
types of AEs reported after administration of 13vPnC+TIV as compared with TIV Alone 
Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, and Withdrawals Due to Adverse Events 
 
A total of 16 subjects died during the 6 primary studies of 13vPnC: 12 (0.21%) of the5667 
subjects who received 13vPnC; and 4 (0.29%) of the 1391 subjects who received23vPS. None of 
the deaths were considered related to study vaccine. 
 
The incidence of SAEs reported within approximately 1 month after vaccination with13vPnC was 
similar across studies, regardless of subject age, while the incidence of SAEs reported at the 6-
month follow-up was slightly lower among subjects 50 to 59 years of age (1.2% to 1.8%) than 
among subjects 60 to 64 years of age (2.9% to 3.1%), and was highest among subjects ≥65 
years of age (3.9% to 5.8%). Most notably, cardiac/cerebrovascular events, neoplasms, 
respiratory disorders, and fractures occurred more frequently among subjects ≥65 years of age 
than among younger subjects. 
 
 
The incidence of serious AEs reported after 13vPnC was generally similar to the incidence after 
23vPS. 
Only 2 SAEs occurring after administration of 13vPnC were considered by the investigator to be 
at least possibly related to study vaccine: idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and Guillain-
Barre syndrome. Both of these resolved 
 
A total of 16 subjects were withdrawn from the studies because of adverse events: 6 had 
received 13vPnC, 9 had received 23vPS, and 1 had received only placebo+TIV. None of these 
adverse events were considered related to study vaccine. 
Safety in Special Groups and Situations 
Intrinsic Factors 
The safety and tolerability of 13vPnC in older adults (≥65 years of age) were evaluated by examining 
data for 4 age subgroups (subjects 65 to 69 years of age, 70 to 74 years of age, 75 to 79 years of age, 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 75/86
 
 
 
 
 
and ≥80 years of age). In addition, the safety and tolerability of 13vPnC were evaluated separately for 
males and females, using data from the 2 pivotal trials (studies 004 and 3005). Finally, safety data 
from all studies were evaluated for subgroups of subjects who had chronic medical conditions that 
could potentially put them at increased risk of pneumococcal disease. 
The conclusions made based upon comparison of data among studies enrolling subjects 50 
to 59 years of age, 60 to 64 years of age,or ≥65 years of age are that, following vaccination 
with an initial study dose of 13vPnC: 
 
The incidence of some local reactions varied across age groups. While redness and swelling were 
reported at similar incidence in all 3 age groups, pain was reported more frequently among 
subjects <65 years of age than among subjects ≥65 years of age, and the incidence of limitation 
of arm movement decreased with increasing age. 
 
Fever was reported at similar incidence across age groups. All other types of systemic events, 
and the use of medications to treat pain and fever, were consistently reported at lowest 
incidence among subjects ≥65 years of age and at highest incidence among subjects 50 to 59 
years of age. 
 
The incidences and types of AEs reported within approximately 1 month after study vaccination 
were similar across all 6 primary studies, and did not appear to be affected by subject age or 
23vPS immunization status. In all studies, the AEs reported were generally consistent with the 
types of diseases and conditions often observed in adults in these age groups. Serious adverse 
events occurring within 6 months after study vaccination were reported somewhat more 
frequently among subjects ≥65 years of age than among younger subjects. 
Local Reactions in Older Adults After Vaccination With 13vPnC 
After an Initial Study Vaccination 
It has already been shown that, after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC, redness and swelling were 
reported at similar incidence across all studies, regardless of the protocol specified age, and generally 
within the range of 10% to 20%. In contrast, pain and limitation of arm movement were reported at 
lower frequency in studies enrolling subjects ≥65 years of age than in studies enrolling younger 
subjects. Among subjects ≥65 years of age, the incidence of redness and swelling was similar across 
the 4 age subgroups, ranging from 8.5% to 17.7% for redness and from 8.7% to 14.2% for swelling, 
and showing no apparent trends related to subject age.  
In contrast, the percentages of subjects reporting pain and limitation of arm movement varied widely 
(ranging from 26.1% to 65.3% for pain, and from 6.2% to 18.5% for limitation of arm movement), 
although no trends associated with subject age were discernable. 
After Vaccination 2 of a 2-Vaccination Sequence 
Study 3005 was the only study in which subjects ≥65 years of age received 13vPnC administered as 
vaccination 2 in a 2-vaccination sequence. There were no subjects 65 to 69 years of age in the study. 
Across the subgroups 70 to 74, 75 to 79, and ≥80 years of age, respectively, the incidence of redness 
increased with age both after 13vPnC/13vPnC (8.4%, 14.8%, and 18.8%) but was variable after 
23vPS/13vPnC (12.0%, 5.5%, and 12.8%). In contrast, the incidence of pain decreased with 
increasing age after vaccination with 23vPS/13vPnC (64.7%, 52.0%, and 42.6%,respectively), and 
after vaccination with 13vPnC/13vPnC the incidence of pain was higher among subjects 70 to 74 years 
of age (64.0%) than among subjects 75 to 79 years of age (52.1%)or subjects ≥80 years of age 
(54.8%). In both vaccine groups, the percentages of subjects reporting swelling and limitation of arm 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 76/86
 
 
 
 
movement were variable across the 3 age subgroups, with no appreciable trends associated with 
subject age. 
Systemic Events in Older Adults After Vaccination With 13vPnC 
After an Initial Study Vaccination 
After an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC, fever was reported at similar incidence across studies, 
regardless of subject age, while all other systemic events were reported at lower incidence among 
subjects ≥65 years of age than among younger subjects. Among subjects ≥65 years of age, the 
incidence of each type of systemic event, including fever, was generally similar across the 4 age 
subgroups examined, with no consistent trends toward increasing or decreasing incidence with 
increasing age. 
After Vaccination 2 of a 2-Vaccination Sequence 
In subjects ≥70 years of age (study 3005), after vaccination 2 of the regimens 13vPnC/13vPnC and 
23vPS/13vPnC, all types of systemic events were, in general, reported at frequencies that varied 
across the 3 age subgroups with no apparent trends related to subject age. 
Related AEs in Older Adults After Vaccination With 13vPnC 
After an Initial Study Vaccination 
Among subjects ≥65 years of age, in each study, related AEs occurring within 1 month after 
vaccination were reported for ≤ 2.6% of subjects in each of the 4 age subgroups examined. At the 6-
month follow-up phone contact, related AEs were reported for only 2 subjects, who were both between 
75 and 79 years of age. 
After Vaccination 2 of a 2-Vaccination Sequence 
In subjects ≥70 years of age (study 3005), after vaccination 2 of the regimens 13vPnC/13vPnC and 
23vPS/13vPnC, related AEs occurring within 1 month after vaccination were reported for 
≤4.8% of subjects in each of the 3 age subgroups. At the 6-month follow-up phone contact, related 
AEs were reported for only 2 subjects. 
High-Risk Populations 
Adults with certain chronic medical conditions may be at increased risk of invasive pneumococcal 
disease (IPD), and preventive vaccination of such individuals against S pneumoniae is of particular 
importance. Each trial included immunocompetent subjects with stable underlying conditions such as 
chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease including alcoholic 
liver disease and alcoholism, renal disorders, and diabetes mellitus that could potentially predispose 
them to IPD. Descriptive information regarding the safety and reactogenicity of 13vPnC among 
subjects in these high-risk populations is provided in this submission Safety and reactogenicity 
patterns were similar in these high-risk adults compared to the overall adult population.

Among subjects ≥65 years of age, in each study, the incidence of serious AEs occurring within 1 month 
after vaccination was ≤2.0% in each of the 4 age subgroups  which is similar to the incidence observed 
in younger subjects in studies 004, 3001, and 3010 (0.2% to 1.1%)  At the 6-month follow-up 
phone contact, SAEs were reported at a slightly higher incidence among subjects ≥65 years of age 
CHMP variation assessment report

(3.9% to 5.8%) than among younger subjects (1.2% to 3.1%). In the 4 age subgroups examined, 
serious AEs were reported at the 6-month follow-up for between 3.4% and 6.1% of subjects in each 
age subgroup in each study with no trends toward increasing incidence with increasing age. 
After Vaccination 2 of a 2-Vaccination Sequence 
In subjects ≥70 years of age (study 3005), after vaccination 2 of the regimens 13vPnC/13vPnC and 
23vPS/13vPnC, serious AEs occurring within 1 month after vaccination were reported for ≤2.4% of 
subjects in each of the 3 age subgroups represented in the study. At the 6-month follow-up, serious 
AEs were reported for ≤5.3% of subjects in each of the 3 age subgroups, except after administration 
of 23vPS/13vPnC in subjects ≥80 years of age, where the incidence of serious AEs was 9.6%. 
Local Reactions 
After administration of 13vPnC, the incidence of all types of local reactions tended to be higher among 
female subjects than among male subjects, both after an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC in naive or 
pre-immunized subjects and after a 2-vaccination sequence (13vPnC/13vPnC or 23vPS/13vPnC) in 
pre-immunized subjects.  
Differences between males and females in the incidence of injection site reactions have been reported 
previously for a number of vaccines, including pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 
After an Initial Study Vaccination 
After an initial study vaccination of 13vPnC in study 004, all 4 types of local reactions (redness, 
swelling, pain, and limitation of arm movement) were reported at substantially higher incidence in 
females than in males. Similar results were seen in study 3005 for redness, swelling, and limitation of 
arm movement, although the differences between the sexes were not as pronounced as in study 004. 
Pain was reported at similar rates in males and females in study 3005. Of interest, differences in 
reactogenicity between males and females were also observed after vaccination with 23vPS in study 
3005, with all 4 types of local reactions reported at higher incidence in females than in males. In 
contrast, after vaccination with 23vPS in study 004, all 4 types of local reactions were reported at 
similar incidence in males and females 
After Vaccination 2 of a 2-Vaccination Sequence 
In study 3005, the incidences of all 4 types of local reactions were substantially higher in females than 
in males after administration of vaccination 2 in both the 13vPnC/13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC sequence 
groups . 
Systemic Events 
After an initial vaccination of 13vPnC in naive subjects 60 to 64 years of age (study 6115A1-004), 
most types of systemic events were reported more frequently among female subjects than among 
male subjects, except for fever, which was reported at similar incidence in both sexes. In contrast, 
after administration of 13vPnC in pre-immunized subjects ≥70 years of age (study 6115A1-3005), 
most types of systemic reactions were reported at similar incidence in male and female subjects. 
In pre-immunized subjects, after the vaccination sequence 13vPnC/13vPnC, most systemic events 
were reported at similar incidence in male and female subjects. However, after 23vPS/13vPnC, fatigue, 
headache, rash, and muscle pain were reported at higher incidence in female subjects than in male 
subjects .

Adverse Events 
In both naive and in pre-immunized subjects, the incidence of all AEs and related AEs reported within 1 
month after an initial vaccination of 13vPnC was similar between male and female subjects In pre-
immunized subjects, the incidence of all AEs and related AEs reported within 1 month after the second 
vaccination in a 2-vaccine sequence was similar between male and female subjects; however, at the 6-
month follow-up contact, AEs were reported slightly more frequently among male subjects than among 
females subjects, respectively, both after 13vPnC/13vPnC (12.6% and 9.2%) and after 23vPS/13vPnC 
(17.3% and 6.9%). This difference was due to somewhat higher incidences of cardiac disorders, 
gastrointestinal disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders in male subjects. 
Serious Adverse Events 
In both naive and pre-immunized subjects, the incidence of SAEs reported within 1 month after an 
initial dose of 13vPnC was ≤1.2% in both male and female subjects, and the incidence of SAEs 
reported at the 6-month follow-up contact was also similar between males and females. 
In pre-immunized subjects, the incidence of SAEs reported within 1 month after vaccination 2 of 
13vPnC/13vPnC and 23vPS/13vPnC was similar in males and females. However, the incidence of SAEs 
reported at the 6-month follow-up contact was slightly more frequent in male than in females, 
respectively, both after 13vPnC/13vPnC (5.8%, 2.7%) and after 23vPS/13vPnC (7.4%, 3.0%), due to 
a higher incidence of cardiac disorders, infections and infestations, and neoplasms in male subjects. 
3.3.8.  Safety Conclusions 
Based on the results of the 6 clinical studies, the reactogenicity profile of 13vPnC has been shown to 
be acceptable and comparable to 23vPS in 23vPS-naive subjects. In subjects pre-immunized with 
23vPS, greater reactogenicity was observed after vaccination with 23vPS than after 13vPnC. 
Overall, safety and reactogenicity data indicate that subjects naive to 23vPS can be safely vaccinated 
with 13vPnC. Even a second dose of 13vPnC given at a stringent 1-year interval does not increase 
reactogenicity (13vPnC/13vPnC). In contrast, administration of a study dose of 23vPS to adults ≥70 
years of age previously immunized at least 5 years earlier with 23vPS, or administration of 13vPnC 
followed by 23vPS 1 year later (13vPnC/23vPS) in younger adults showed higher local reactogenicity, 
and an increase for some systemic events. 
The common feature for each of these immunization regimens is receipt of 23vPS with its high 
pneumococcal polysaccharide load (25 μg for each polysaccharide) in a setting of pre-existing antibody 
from prior vaccination. This high polysaccharide load in the setting of prior antibody is likely to be 
responsible for the increased reactions seen. Higher pre-existing antibody titers have been associated 
with increased reactions after 23vPS whether present at the time of initial vaccination or at 
revaccination. 
Subjects vaccinated with 23vPS followed 1 year later by 13vPnC (23vPS/13vPnC) showed an 
acceptable safety profile, indicating subjects vaccinated with 23vPA could be safely vaccinated with 
13vPnC, even at a stringent 1-year interval, if needed. When subjects had an interval of 5 or more 
years between the 23vPS dose and a 13vPnC dose, the safety profile was similar or even improved 
compared to the 1-year interval. Overall, subjects pre-immunized with 23vPS had significantly fewer 
local and systemic events when vaccinated with 13vPnC compared to revaccination with 23vPS. It was 
also shown that pre-immunized subjects vaccinated with 13vPnC can safely receive a second dose of 
13vPnC. Those revaccinated with 23vPS may also safely receive a subsequent dose of 13vPnC if 
needed.

The safety and immunogenicity of 13vPnC will be assessed in post approval studies conducted in 
children and adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, children and adults after 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and children and adults with sickle cell disease. 
Safety data from the 84,500 subjects in the ongoing efficacy study (CAPITA, 6115A1-3006) will be 
provided as a postmarketing commitment. 
3.4.  Pharmacovigilance 
3.4.1.  Risk Management Plan 
The EU-RMP as proposed by the MAH is quite thorough in its discussion of safety concerns and is well 
planned in its plan to address the safety concerns in post authorisation safety studies.  The EU-RMP is 
well written and its presentation is in accordance with Volume 9A.   
The greatest concerns with regards to risk management perhaps lie in the potential changes in the 
epidemiology of non-vaccine serotypes of S. pneumoniae and other organisms which cause the 
targeted disease outcomes of pneumonia, otitis media and meningitis.  The Applicant has appropriately 
recognized these risks, amongst others, and has provided a foundation for risk management. 
From the extensive review of epidemiology provided in the RMP, it is evident that overall rates of IPD 
disease have decreased in children since the introduction of 7vPnC.  Furthermore, there is also 
evidence of a decreased rate in adults in the US, likely secondary to the effects of herd immunity.  A 
less marked effect in adults has been seen in Europe.  However, review of the serotype distribution 
involved in IPD, both overall and in adults, shows a decrease in coverage of both 7vPnC and 13vPnC 
since introduction of 7vPnC, of up to 10-15%. 
Also, there is evidence presented of a decrease in hospital admissions for all pneumonia, outpatient 
visits for otitis media, and incidence rates of pneumococcal meningitis in children.  However, there is 
also evidence of increasing amounts of disease caused by non vaccine serotypes and other bacterial 
agents, such as M. Catarrhalis and H. Influenzae. 
The MAH also presented data to show that increasing ages in adults are associated with increases in 
outpatient treatment, hospitalisation and mortality from community acquired pneumonia.

2) 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
From review of pharmacovigilance plan it is evident that the Applicant is attempting to address each of 
the safety concerns using various clinical studies.   
Regarding the most serious safety concern of changing epidemiology by both non vaccine serotypes 
and other bacterial organisms causing the same targeted clinical diseases, which is of concern with 
both paediatric and adult use, the MAH has made extensive collaborations with several national 
agencies to perform population based surveillance as described below. 
Population-based surveillance in 5 European countries is planned to be used to address the safety 
concerns of post approval and long-term effectiveness (IPD, pneumonia and AOM-related outcomes) 
and the changing epidemiology of non-vaccine serotypes.  At least one of these surveillance systems, 
ACTIV in France, is to be used for monitoring the concern of the impact of vaccine on nasopharyngeal 
carriage.  A synopsis of these surveillance systems was provided, and the developing protocols are 
anticipated during the application process. The applicant should discuss how these surveillance 
systems will be used to specifically address the concerns of decreased immunogenicity of 13vPnS as 
compared to 7vPnC and the decreased functional immune response for 4 of the additional 6 serotypes 
(1, 3, 5 and 19A). The safety concern of the impact of 13vPnC on nasopharyngeal carriage will be 
investigated through both observational surveillance after vaccine introduction (as mentioned above) 
and in a clinical trial, comparing isolates obtained from children receiving 7vPnS with those obtained 
from children receiving 13vPnC, a study which is currently ongoing in Israel. 
Additional parts of the pharmacovigilance plan to address concerns for adult use are a study in HIV 
infected adults and clinical extension studies which will investigate safety with more than 1 dose of 
13vPnC. 
3) 
Risk minimisation  
The proposal of routine risk minimisation activities addressing the safety concerns is adequate.

There are no additional risk minimisation activities recommended for its use in the adult population.

3.6.  Overall conclusions and  benefit-risk assessment 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The currently available 23vPS vaccine has shown efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease in 
elderly. Therefore this vaccine serves as an acceptable control for this indication. The MAH has chosen 
to compare the immune responses to Prevenar 13 and 23vPS vaccine using OPA. OPA measures 
functional antibodies and is considered the best available option for serological comparisons between 
the two vaccines. In children and infants the OPA responses were shown to correlate to protection 
against IPD after vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Although the clinical 
picture differs somewhat between children and adults, it is very likely that protection is mediated 
through the same mechanism, i.e. opsonising antibodies. The ad hoc expert group also concluded that 
it is reasonable to accept OPA responses as a surrogate marker for vaccine efficacy in IPD. 
It is acknowledged that no protective threshold for prevention of invasive disease has been defined in 
adults, but a non-inferiority comparison is considered valid. 
The immune responses as measured with OPA to the 13vPnC vaccine have been shown to be non-
inferior to the responses to the 23vPS vaccine for the 12 common serotypes, and for several of these 
serotypes the responses were also superior. The immune response to serotype 6A, which is unique to 
the 13vPnC vaccine, has been shown to be similar to the responses to the other 13vPnC vaccine 
serotypes. Consistent results were obtained in naïve subjects 60-64 years, and ≥65 years, as well as 
subjects ≥70 years of age who had received 23vPS vaccine more than 5 years previously. The immune 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 82/86
 
 
 
 
responses to the 23vPnC vaccine in subjects 50-59 years of age were shown to be non-inferior to those 
in older subjects.  
Thus, the demonstrated non-inferiority of the OPA responses of the 13vPnC vaccine to the 23vPS 
indicates that the 13vPnC vaccine also has at least the same immediate protective efficacy against 
invasive disease caused by the common serotypes.  
A conjugate vaccine is expected to have benefits over a polysaccharide vaccine, in terms of 
boostability, immunological memory and generally improved immune responses, due to the T-cell 
dependent characteristics of the immune response. The 13vPnC vaccine has demonstrated all these 
characteristics in children, and fundamental differences in adults are not expected. The recently 
submitted data from study 6115A1-004 indicate that the 13vPnC vaccine induces immunological 
memory in subjects 60-64 years of age as well, while the 23vPS vaccine clearly does not. The duration 
of the immunological memory has been demonstrated 3-4 years after primary vaccination. 
A negative effect of the 23vPS vaccine on subsequent vaccination with 13vPnC or 23vPS vaccine one 
year later has consistently been shown (hyporesponsiveness). Hyporesponsiveness was not seen 
following the administration of 13vPnC vaccine.  
The study population included healthy subjects, and immunocompetent subjects with stable underlying 
conditions.  
The immune responses to trivalent influenza vaccine administered concomitantly with the 13vPnC 
vaccine were very similar to the responses to influenza vaccine given alone. Likewise, the responses to 
the pneumococcal antigens were non-inferior with the exception of serotype 19F in study 3008, which 
indicates that the two vaccines may be given concomitantly.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The protective efficacy against non-invasive disease (e.g. community acquired pneumonia) has not 
been clearly demonstrated for the 23vPS vaccine. The efficacy has been limited and inconsistently 
shown in several published clinical studies. The ad hoc expert group concluded that it will not be 
justifiable to claim efficacy of 13vPCV against other (non-invasive) pneumococcal infections based only 
on comparison of serological responses. Therefore, it is currently unknown if Prevenar 13 protects 
against CAP. However, a Phase 4 Clinical Trial (CAPiTA) of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
efficacy in prevention of vaccine-serotype pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia and invasive 
pneumococcal disease is currently ongoing, and the results are expected in December 2013. 
The duration of immunity is currently not known. Data on antibody persistence is currently limited to 
one year, and preliminary data on immunological memory are limited to 3-4 years. 
Data in high-risk immunocompromised populations is currently lacking. The clinical studies in elderly 
included healthy subjects and subjects who were immunocompetent with stable underlying conditions.  
The relative value of improved immune responses of the 13vPnC over the broader strain coverage of 
the 23vPS vaccine is a very important issue. The data described previously from the USA and England 
and Wales demonstrates that the coverage of the 13vPnC vaccine decreased from around 70% to 50% 
when pneumococcal vaccination with 7vPnC was introduced in the childhood vaccination program. This 
is likely to be attributed to herd protection, i.e. decreased circulation of the vaccine strains. This also 
affects the coverage of the 23vPS vaccine, as 12 of the serotypes are common to both vaccines.  
Epidemiological surveillance to ensure early detection of serotype replacement is considered of 
outmost importance. The MAH has committed to report the results of ongoing surveillance. Serotype 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 83/86
 
 
 
 
replacement has been seen as a result of childhood vaccinations, and may occur regardless of adult 
vaccinations. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
There are no differences in the safety profile of 13vPnC in adults and older adults as compared to that 
observed in the young population. Furthermore, the safety profiles of 23vPS and 13vPnC are also 
similar and no new or significant safety issues have been identified when comparing the two vaccines 
in the present study populations. 
The local reactions are generally slightly higher with 13vPnC as compared with 23vPS and more 
pronounced in the younger group i.e. 59-64 years. The incidence is higher in males. The gender 
difference is not so pronounced for systemic adverse events and not considered to be of clinical 
relevance. 
Comparatively few serious adverse events were observed in the submitted studies. One case of GBS in 
the older populations was described as were one case of idiopathic thrombocytopenia, one case of 
lupus erythematosus and a few cases of arthralgia. This may indicate activation of autoimmune 
disease. Adverse reactions such as rash, injection site reactions, pain, pyrexia, myalgia, arthralgia, 
headache and fatigue are all listed in the summary of product characteristics. One case of sleep 
apnoea was described at the 6 month follow-up visit (Apnoea in very premature infants (< 28 weeks 
gestation) is listed for 13vPnC.) 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Further close monitoring of all cases of autoimmune reactions must continue. The predisposition for 
activation of such reactions is pronounced in the referred study population including older age groups. 
The size of the safety database may be too small to detect rare AEs occurring at a frequency lower 
than 0.1%. For this reason, the MAH should provide safety data from the ongoing study (CAPiTA, 
6115A1-3006) as a post-marketing commitment.  
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Invasive pneumococcal disease is an important health problem in the elderly population. The annual 
incidence of IPD in subjects ≥65 years is reported to be from 24 to 85 cases/100 000 population (WHO 
position paper: 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, WER 83: 373-384, 2008). The existing 
23vPS vaccine is recommended in several EU countries with varying coverage. Several clinical 
observational studies have documented the efficacy of the 23vPS vaccine against IPD caused by 
vaccine serotypes. The protection wanes over 5-10 years, and revaccination is generally not 
recommended with shorter intervals than 5 years due to hyporesponsiveness following vaccination.  
In Europe and the United States, S. pneumoniae is estimated to cause approximately 30–50% of 
community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs) requiring hospitalization in adults. 
The non-inferiority to the 23vPS vaccine is considered relevant and acceptable surrogate for protection 
against IPD. However, the lack of proven efficacy against non-invasive pneumococcal disease by the 
23vPS vaccine makes an extrapolation of efficacy of this indication to the 13vPnC vaccine inappropriate 
until further data is available.  
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 84/86
 
 
 
 
The issue of strain coverage is considered very important, and needs close epidemiological surveillance 
in order to continuously assess the absolute benefit of vaccinating with the 13vPnC vaccine.  
The safety issues do not involve any immediate unfavourable effects or exert any negative influence on 
the balance between favourable and unfavourable effects.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The expected benefit in terms of protection against invasive pneumococcal disease clearly outweighs 
the risk of adverse reactions in adults 50 years and older for Prevenar 13. The benefit is expected to 
be smaller in subjects 50-59 years as the risk of disease is greater from 60 years of age onwards, but 
the balance is still positive.  
For non-invasive pneumococcal disease the benefit is not considered demonstrated currently, and 
therefore it is not possible to conclude a positive benefit-risk balance for this indication.  
The benefit of giving Prevenar13 concomitantly with the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine also 
outweighs the risk of increased reactogenicity.  
3.7.  Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
A conjugate vaccine is expected to elicit an immune response with all the characteristics of a T-cell 
dependent response, e.g. IgG response, affinity maturation of antibodies with repeated exposure, 
induction of immunological memory, and long lasting immunity. The responses to free polysaccharide 
vaccines on the other hand are generally expected to be mainly IgM, in the absence of previous 
immune memory, of shorter duration and no immunological memory. Therefore, a conjugate vaccine 
has many advantages, especially in long-term protection. The immune responses to the primary 
vaccination were shown to be non-inferior or superior to most serotypes in the 13vPnC vaccine 
compared to the 23vPS vaccine, as expected. In recently submitted preliminary data there is a strong 
indication of immunological memory 3-4 years following a primary vaccination with 13vPnC. In the 
same study the 23vPS vaccine was clearly shown not to induce immunological memory.  
The 23vPS vaccine was shown to induce hyporesponsiveness to subsequent vaccination, regardless of 
whether 23vPS or 13vPnC vaccine is used. The 13vPnC vaccine did not elicit immune responses to a 
subsequent dose that were superior to the responses to the first dose, which can be expected. The 
responses were very similar after the second and first dose when given one years apart. Considering 
that this vaccine has demonstrated all characteristics of a T-cell dependent antigen in children, it is 
unlikely that any other effect would be seen in adults. Final data from study 6115A1-004 are requested 
as well as longer term follow-up.  
It is very likely that protection against non-invasive disease requires higher antibody levels than what 
is required for invasive disease, as the antibodies must transudate to the site of infection in order to 
protect. Therefore it is not considered possible to conclude on efficacy against non-invasive disease 
based on serological bridging to the 23vPS vaccine.  
The benefit-risk balance of Prevenar 13 for prevention of invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae is 
therefore considered positive. However, it is beyond the scope of the CHMP to conclude on the relative 
role of Prevenar13 versus the 23-valent vaccine. Whether one or the other vaccine, or both vaccines, 
should be used in national programmes is the decision of national authorities.

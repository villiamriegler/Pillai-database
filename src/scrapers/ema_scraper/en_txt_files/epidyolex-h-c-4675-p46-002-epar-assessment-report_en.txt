1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
Submission of information about paediatric studies completed after 26 January 2007 in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation 1901/2006, as amended. GW Pharma (International) B.V. is submitting 
the following paediatric study which completed on 13th June 2019. 
Trial: GWEP15100 - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of cannabidiol (CBD; GWP42003-P) in infants with infantile spasms following an initial open-label 
pilot study. 
This study is part of a PIP (EMEA-001964-PIP01-16), for which the initial Decision (P/0136/2017) is 
included in this submission. Also enclosed is a recent PIP modification Opinion (EMEA-001964-PIP01-
16-M01, dated 11th December 2019), for which the updated Decision was pending during the 
procedure.

1.2.  Introduction  
Epidyolex was approved, via the EU centralised procedure by the Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (CHMP), with European Commission (EC) decision issued on 19th September 2019 for the 
following indication: Epidyolex is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with clobazam, for patients 
2 years of age and older. 
The intent of this paediatric study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Epidyolex (cannabidiol oral 
solution [CBD-OS]) in infantile spasm (IS) in patients aged 1 month to 24 months. The planned study 
comprised an open-label pilot phase, with 2 sequential cohorts, followed by a randomised double-blind 
pivotal phase. All patients could receive GWP42003-P during a subsequent OLE phase, lasting for a 
maximum of 1 year. The study is part of a paediatric investigational plan (PIP) as approved by the 
European Medicines Agency’s Paediatric Committee (EMA’s PDCO).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

In the pilot phase, there were no treatment responders after 2 weeks of treatment, as confirmed on 
video-electroencephalography (EEG) (no patients were both free of clinical spasms and had resolution 
of hypsarrhythmia). The study met prespecified no-go criteria for the pivotal phase of the study.  
As a result, the paediatric study provided individual efficacy and safety data for the 9 enrolled patients 
with IS. Available safety data are consistent with the known safety profile of CBD in the authorised 
treatments of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. No unexpected or clinically significant 
safety findings were noted.  
Therefore, no regulatory consequences were identified by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH). 
CHMP comments 
The  MAH  has  correctly  presented  the  approved  indication  for  Epidyolex  (cannabidiol), 
namely: 
‘Epidyolex  is  indicated  for  use  as  adjunctive  therapy  of  seizures  associated  with  Lennox-
Gastaut  syndrome  (LGS)  or  Dravet  syndrome  (DS),  in  conjunction  with  clobazam,  for 
patients 2 years of age and older ‘ 
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol in 
the  treatment  of  infantile  spasm  in  patients  aged  1  month  to  24  months.  The  study  was 
designed with an initial pilot phase intending to include a total of 10 infants. As the pre-
defined No-go criteria were fulfilled after 9 enrolled patients, the study was terminated and 
therefore the pivotal OLE phase was not carried through.  
The study was part of a paediatric investigational plan (PIP) as approved by the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Paediatric Committee (PDCO). 
Of note, the MAH has not submitted a full clinical study report (CSR) but merely a synoptic 
CSR and a clinical overview. These two documents are essentially similar. Additional data 
are presented as summary tables for baseline characteristics, demographics, efficacy and 
safety data and as patient narratives for Serious Treatment-emergent Adverse Events and 
Other Significant Events. This is acceptable.  
2.  Summary of data submitted  
2.1.  Methodology 
2.1.1. Study design  
This was a multi-site study evaluating the efficacy and safety of CBD (GWP42003-P) in patients with 
infantile spasms (IS) who failed to become spasm free following treatment with 1 or more approved IS 
therapies. 
During study planning, discussions were held with multiple paediatric neurology epileptologists from 
the US and European Union. All were in agreement that in patients who had failed high-dose steroids 
and/or vigabatrin, the reasonable treatment goal would be the elimination of both hypsarrhythmia and 
spasms in these patients. Elimination of neither or only 1 feature of IS, i.e., the hypsarrhythmia or the 
spasms, was considered unlikely to halt the known progressive encephalopathy and development of 
LGS that occurs over time in most of these patients. 
An independent data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) considered the safety of the patients 
throughout the study and confirmed doses and dose regimens that would have been investigated in 
the pivotal phase. 
To progress from the pilot phase to the pivotal phase, an acceptable safety profile in the pilot phase 
was required. The Go/No Go criteria developed by the sponsor were as follows: 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/116928/2020  
Page 4/24 
 
 
 
• 
If the DSMC determined that data from the pilot phase showed no clinically significant serious 
adverse events (SAE) (e.g. status epilepticus, hepatic failure, death) occurred, then the study 
continued (Go criterion), and 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If there were 2 or more responders, the study continued to the pivotal phase (Go criterion). 
If the DSMC determined that data from the pilot phase showed clinically significant SAEs (e.g. 
status epilepticus, hepatic failure, death) that would likely occur regardless of changes in 
titration schedule or dose, then the study was halted (No Go criterion), or 
If there were fewer than 2 responders in cohort 1, the study was halted (No Go criterion). 
In order for the study to progress to the pivotal phase, the safety and efficacy Go criteria had 
to be satisfied. 
The planned study comprised an open-label pilot safety phase, with 2 sequential cohorts, followed by a 
placebo-controlled pivotal phase. The first cohort of the pilot phase enrolled patients aged between 6 
and 24 months. The second cohort of the pilot phase enrolled patients aged between 1 and 24 months. 
All patients received GWP42003-P for 2 weeks. The trial met No-go criteria since none of the 9 patients 
enrolled during the pilot phase had resolution of spasms and hypsarrhythmia following 2 weeks of 
open-label treatment. The trial was therefore terminated prior to full enrolment into the pilot phase 
and the pivotal phase was not initiated. 
All patients who completed the pilot phase of the study had the opportunity to receive GWP42003-P 
during a subsequent OLE phase, lasting for a maximum of 1 year. Following end of treatment, 
withdrawal, or discontinuation of the study medication, all patients who ended treatment tapered down 
their study medication over 10 days followed by a safety follow-up. 
CHMP comments 
The study was designed with an initial pilot phase including a total of 10 infants and with 
pre-defined  Go-  and  No-go  criteria.  The  approach  of  having  predefined  Go-  and  No-go 
criteria determining the future of the trial is fully endorsed as this ensured that the study 
was  not  unnecessarily  prolonged  if  no  clinically  relevant  effect  of  the  treatment  was 
observed/expected and/or if there were unacceptable safety issues.  
2.1.2. Number of Patients (Planned and Analysed) 
In total, 10 patients were planned to be enrolled in the pilot phase (5 per cohort). Nine patients were 
actually enrolled in the pilot phase, 5 in the first cohort and 4 in the second cohort, as No Go criteria 
were met after the ninth patient completed the 2-week treatment period. 
All 9 patients completed the pilot phase and entered the OLE phase. 
2.1.3. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion 
Patients were male or female, who had documented hypsarrhythmia and IS on prolonged video-
electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, aged 6 to 24 months (inclusive) in the first cohort or aged 1 
to 24 months (inclusive) in the second cohort, had failed to respond adequately to treatment with 1 or 
more approved IS therapies, and had been stable for all non-pharmacological interventions for epilepsy 
for 2 weeks prior to screening. 
Patients were not eligible if they had any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any 
of the excipients of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), such as sesame oil, had significantly 
impaired hepatic function at the screening visit, had taken clobazam or any oral mTOR inhibitor within

the 2 weeks prior to the screening visit, and if they had a QTcB interval of >460 msec on 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG). 
For a complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, refer to the study protocol (Section 6). 
CHMP comments 
The  study  included  infants  with  documented  hypsarrhythmia  and  infantile  spasms  on 
prolonged video-electroencephalography (EEG). The initial cohort of the pilot phase included 
the oldest age-group (6-24 months) and only in the second cohort, children under the age 
of  6  months  were  included.  Currently,  Epidyolex  is  indicated  in  children  from  2  years 
however, due to the early debut of the disease (often within the first year from birth) and 
the  progressive  nature  of  the  disease,  it  is  considered  acceptable  to  include  patients  <2 
years of age.  
By  including  only  patients  who  had  failed  to  respond  on  initial  therapies  approved  for 
infantile  spams,  the  MAH  probably  aimed  for  a  second-line  treatment.  Of  note,  in  the 
interpretation  of  the  results,  it  should  also  be  considered  that  only  the  most 
severe/treatment-resistant patients were included. 
Overall, in- and exclusion criteria are considered appropriate.  
2.1.4. Investigational Medicinal Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
The IMP (GWP42003-P) was a clear, colourless to yellow solution containing 100 mg/mL CBD dissolved 
in the following excipients: sesame oil and anhydrous ethanol (79 mg/mL) with added sweetener 
(sucralose) and strawberry flavouring. 
Mode of administration: Oral. Dosing via a gastrostomy/nasogastric tube (as required) was considered 
following approval by the GW medical monitor. 
Dose (pilot phase): All patients were titrated up to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day over 4 days (starting 
at 10 mg/kg/day and increasing by 10 mg/kg/day for the subsequent 3 days) and continued at this 
dose, or the highest tolerated dose up to 40 mg/kg/day, for the remainder of the 2-week treatment 
phase. 
Dose (OLE phase): Patients remained on the same dose reached in the pilot phase, or the highest 
tolerated dose up to 40 mg/kg/day, for the remainder of the OLE phase. 
Dosage: GWP42003-P was taken twice daily (morning and evening), maintaining consistency regarding 
feeds/meals and other concomitant medications, and could be taken with other concomitant 
medications as directed by the investigator. If the IMP was poorly tolerated, dosing could be changed 
to 3 times daily (while keeping the equivalent total daily dose), following approval by the GW medical 
monitor. The recommended dosing intervals were: 
•  12-hourly (8-hourly minimum) for twice daily dosing. 
•  6-hourly (minimum) for 3 times daily dosing. 
CHMP comments 
During the pilot study,  infants were titrated up to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day over 4 
days (starting at 10 mg/kg/day and increasing by 10 mg/kg/day for the subsequent 3 days). 
For  the  approved  indications  (‘as  adjunctive  therapy  of  seizures  associated  with  Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS)’), the recommended dose is initially 5 
mg/kg per day increased with 5 mg/kg after one week to a maximum recommended dose 
of  20  mg/kg/day.  Thus,  despite  that  the  included  infants  are  younger  than  the  licensed 
indication, the dose is somewhat higher. This may compromise the safety but should ensure

efficacy. Considered that the study included severely ill treatment-refractory patients and 
that the dose was titrated and the patients were under close supervision, the dose used in 
the present study is acceptable.  
The daily dose was divided in 2-3 dosing intervals which considered the PK value for time 
to  maximum  plasma  concentration  at  steady  state  (being  2.5-5  hours)  appears  relevant. 
Further,  it  is  endorsed  that  the  study  medication  should  be  given  consistently  with 
feeds/meals as co-administration of cannabidiol with high-fat/high-calorie meals increases 
the  absorption  rate  substantially  (approximately  a  5-fold  increase  in  Cmax  and  a  4-fold 
increase in AUC).  
2.1.5. Duration of Treatment and Study period 
Study duration  
Patients received GWP42003-P for 2 weeks in the pilot phase and up to 1 year in the OLE phase. 
Study Period 
The date of first informed consent was 24Apr2017. 
The initial pilot phase ended on 20May2018, and the open-label extension (OLE) phase continued until 
13Jun2019. 
The date of last primary endpoint data collection from the last patient was 08May2018. 
The date of last observation from the last patient was 13Jun2019. 
The date of database lock was 12Aug2019.  
CHMP comments 
Study dates are presented. As all patients who completed the pilot phase of the study could 
be enrolled in the subsequent OLE phase. Therefore, the final date for ‘last patient last visit’ 
was later than the date for ‘last patient last visit’ in the pilot phase.  
2.1.6. Objectives, Endpoints, Statistical Methods, and Results 
Listed below are the objectives, endpoints, statistical analysis and results in the pilot and pivotal 
phases of the study that are described in this report.

CHMP comments 
The  MAH  has  clearly  presented  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoint  of  each  part  of  the 
study (pilot phase and pivotal phase). All the chosen endpoints are considered relevant or 
the corresponding objectives.  
The pilot phase had two primary objectives addressing the efficacy and safety of the product. 
This is endorsed and also in accordance with the predefined Go- and No-go criteria.  
The statistical methods are considered acceptable.

2.2.  RESULTS 
2.2.1. Summary of Patient Disposition 
In total, 10 patients were screened, and 9 patients were enrolled in the pilot phase. All 9 patients 
completed the 2-week treatment period and entered the OLE phase (Table 1.1).  
In the OLE phase, 2 patients completed the treatment period and 7 patients withdrew. Four completed 
6 months of treatment and 3 completed 12 months of treatment. 
Of the 7 patients who withdrew during the OLE phase, 3 withdrew due to lack of perceived benefit, 3 
withdrew due to withdrawal of parental consent, and 1 withdrew to begin treatment with commercially 
available Epidiolex® (Table 1.1). 
2.2.2. Exposure 
All 9 patients were exposed to GWP42003-P for a median of 15 days during the pilot phase (range: 15 
to 17 days) (Table 7.1) and for a median of 9.7 weeks during the OLE phase (range: 2 to 53 weeks) 
(Table 7.2). All 9 patients reached the target dose (40 mg/kg/day) per the protocol.

CHMP comments 
The  MAH  has  sufficiently  presented  the  patient  disposition.  A  total  of  9  patients  were 
included  in  the  study  as  one  of  the  No-go  criteria  was  fulfilled  after  the  9  patients  had 
completed the 2 weeks’ pilot phase. All 9 patients continued in the pivotal OLE study but 
due to termination of the study (as explained above), only 2 patients completed the entire 
OLE study period. Three (3) additional patients completed 12 months treatment.  
Reasons  for  withdrawal  from  the  study  included  withdrawal  of  consent  (3  patients), 
perceiving that the patient would not benefit from the treatment (3 patients) and one patient 
withdrew for the reason ‘Other’. No patients were withdrawn due to adverse events (AEs). 
In accordance with patient disposition and the number of patients completing the pilot phase 
and the OLE phase of the study, mean and median duration of study treatment in the pilot 
phase was 15 days (range 15-17 days). Likewise, in accordance with the study protocol, all 
9 patients were included in the OLE phase for at least 2 weeks. Mean and median duration 
of exposure in the OLE phase was 22.7 and 9.7 weeks, respectively. This indicates that the 
patients were enrolled over a long period which is confirmed by the dates for duration of

treatment  and  study  period  (see  section  2.1.5.  ‘Duration  of  Treatment  and  Study  period’ 
above). 
In both of the study phases (pilot phase and OLE phase), all 9 patients had a compliance of 
80-120%. Thus, compliance is not considered to have affected neither efficacy nor safety in 
any significant degree.   
2.2.3. Demography and Baseline Characteristics 
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of the 9 patients at informed consent was 12.2 (5.56) months 
(range: 6 to 23 months). There were 6 female and 3 male patients; most (8 of 9) were White. The 
mean (SD) birth weight was 2.9 (0.86) kg (range: 1 to 4 kg) (Table 2.1).  
CHMP comments 
The majority of the included patients were born at time (median gestational age 40 weeks) 
but one patient was born prematurely at Week 28. Mean and median birth weight was 2.9 
and 3.1 kg, respectively. There were 6 females and 3 males thus a small overrepresentation 
of girls which is not considered to affect the results. The majority (8) of the patients were 
White.  Mean  and  median  age  at  time  of  informed  consent  was  12.2  and  11.0  months, 
respectively.  Overall,  the  included  patients  appear  to  be  representative  for  a  European 
population of infants with infantile spasms.  
A total of 8 patients had previously been treated with ACTH, 5 patients had been treated 
with  benzodiazepines  derivates,  4  with  glucocorticoids  and  2  patients  with  fatty  acid 
derivates and/or barbiturates and derivates. One patient had been treated with carboxamide 
derivates (data submitted in tabulated form but not presented in the present AR). Thus, all 
included patients had been treated with at least one initial therapy approved for infantile 
spams. By including only patients who had failed to respond on initial therapies approved 
for  infantile  spams,  it  may  be  considered  that  only  the  most  severe/treatment-resistant 
patients were included.

2.2.4. Efficacy Results (Safety population) 
2.2.4.1. Pilot Phase 
Efficacy Endpoint: There were no treatment responders after 2 weeks of treatment, as observed on 
video-EEG (no patients were both free of clinical spasms and had a resolution of hypsarrhythmia). 
CHMP comment 
As stated by the MAH, none of the 9 patients could be considered treatment responders as 
defined in the pilot phase of the study. None of the 9 patients were free of clinical spasms 
and all patients had hypsarrhythmia on the EEG. Thus, the study met the No-go criteria and 
was terminated.  
2.2.4.2. OLE Phase 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 
The proportion of treatment responders at the OLE phase as determined by video-EEG at Days 29, 43, 
127, 211, 295, and 379 or End of Treatment is shown in Table 1. Some patients responded at some 
visits. Three patients were noted to be free of spasms and hypsarrhythmia between Day 29 and Day 
379. In 2 of the 3 patients, clobazam had been added prior to the resolution of spasms and 
hypsarrhythmia. However, in each of these 3 patients, the EEG was not normal, and other seizure 
types were reported either during the video-EEG or by the caregiver. It is most likely that the IS with 
hypsarrhythmia was evolving into another type of epilepsy (e.g. LGS) in these patients.  
Table 2 presents the presence of spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and other seizure types for each patient by 
visit.

The proportion of spasms and seizure subtypes by caregiver observation and by study visit are detailed 
in the CSR. Caregivers recorded patient’s spasms and seizures by category in a daily diary. The seizure 
subtype, Focal, occurred once in a patient at Day 19, Day 29, and Day 379. The seizure subtype, 
Tonic-Clonic, occurred once in a patient at Day 127, Day 211, Day 295, and Day 379. The seizure 
subtype, Absence, occurred once in a patient at Day 127, Day 211, Day 295, and Day 379. The seizure 
subtype, Myoclonic, occurred once in a patient on Day 127, the seizure subtype, Atonic, occurred once 
in a patient at Day 295, and the seizure subtype, Clonic, occurred once in a patient at Day 379. 
The summary of the Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CGIC) score and summary of the 
Physician Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score for each study visit are detailed in the CSR. The 
CGIC is a single question assessment completed by the caregiver, and the PGIC is a single question 
assessment completed by the investigator. The question assesses the status of the patient’s condition 
since start of treatment rated on a 7-point scale from 1-"very much improved" to 7-"very much 
worse".

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/116928/2020  
Page 13/24 
 
 
 
 
 
The responses on both the CGIC and PGIC scores were largely favorable at each study visit time point. 
•  The CGIC scores were either ‘very much improved’, ‘much improved’, ‘slightly improved’, or ‘no 
change’ for all responding patients at Days 29, 43, 127, 211, and 295. At End of Treatment 
(Day 379), 2 (22.2%) patients reported ‘very much improved’, 1 (11.1%) patient reported 
‘much improved’, 3 (33.3%) patients reported ‘slightly improved’, whereas 1 (11.1%) patient 
reported ‘slightly worse’, and 1 (11.1%) patient reported ‘much worse’. 
•  The PGIC scores were either ‘very much improved’, ‘much improved’, ‘slightly improved’, or ‘no 
change’ for all responding patients at Days 29, 43, 71, 127, and 211. At End of Treatment 
(Day 379), 1 (11.1%) patient reported ‘much improved’, 3 (33.3%) patients reported ‘slightly 
improved’, 2 (22.2%) patients reported ‘no change’, whereas 1 (11.1%) patient reported 
‘slightly worse’, and 1 (11.1%) patient reported ‘much worse’. 
The summary of Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales Change from baseline by study visit is detailed in 
the CSR. The Vineland-II scores were assessed by the patient’s caregiver and included questions about 
communication, daily living, skills, physical activity, problem behaviours, social skills and relationships. 
Scoring generally ranged from "usually" to "never". Higher scores represent greater levels of 
functioning and lower scores represent lower levels of functioning. The results showed that the overall 
mean (SD) change from baseline to Day 211 was 6.3 (3.5) and from baseline to End of Treatment 
(Day 379) was -5.4 (23.4). 
The changes from baseline in height, body weight, and head circumference is detailed in the CSR. The 
average change from baseline to End of Treatment (Day 379) in height was an increase of 5.31 
(±4.04) cm, in weight an increase of 1.19 (±0.86) kg, and in head circumference an increase of 1.14 
(±1.7) cm. 
CHMP comments 
In  the  OLE  phase,  three  patients  had  temporary  resolution  of  the  spasms  and 
hypsarrhythmia in a period of approximately 1 year, though the EEGs were not normal for 
any of these patients. Furthermore, 2 of these patients had initiated concomitant treatment 
with clobazam. The MAH states that most likely, the patients’ disease was transforming into 
another type of epilepsy. It is agreed that this is most likely as this is characteristic for the 
disease of infantile spasms.  
2.2.5. Safety Results 
Safety data are presented for the Safety Analysis Population defined as all patients who received at 
least 1 dose of IMP in the pilot phase. 
An overall summary of adverse events (AEs) in the pilot phase and OLE phase is provided in Table 3.

2.2.5.1. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
In the pilot phase, 6 (66.7%) patients presented with at least 1 TEAE. The majority of the TEAEs were 
mild in intensity. One patient experienced a TEAE of moderate intensity (constipation), and 1 patient 
experienced a TEAE of severe intensity (status epilepticus). Reported TEAEs by SOC and PT are shown 
in Table 11.2.1. 
In the OLE phase, 7 (77.8%) patients presented with at least 1 TEAE. Two patients experienced 
multiple TEAEs of moderate intensity, and 2 patients experienced multiple TEAEs of severe intensity. 
Reported TEAEs by SOC and PT are shown in Table 11. 2.2.

2.2.5.2. Treatment-Related TEAEs 
During the pilot phase, 2 patients presented with a total of 5 treatment-related TEAEs (by preferred 
term [PT]: 2 events of diarrhoea, 1 event of increased appetite, 1 event of somnolence, and 1 event of 
irritability). 
During the OLE phase, 2 patients presented with a total of 2 treatment-related TEAEs (by PT: 1 event 
of blood triglycerides increase, and 1 event of hypertension). 
2.2.5.3. Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
During titration in the pilot phase, 1 patient presented with a SAE of status epilepticus. The event 
resolved the same day with intravenous fosphenytoin, intramuscular lorazepam, phenobarbital and 
intravenous levetiracetam. The event was considered severe, but not related to treatment.  
During the OLE phase, 2 patients presented with multiple SAEs related to infections (mostly 
respiratory), diarrhoea, and urinary problems. 
Patient 1 presented with the following SAEs considered by the principal investigator (PI) to be of 
severe intensity: Pneumonia at Days 286-310 (25 days duration), with both Enterovirus infection, 
Respiratory failure, and Rhinovirus Infection during Days 287-298 (12 days of duration), and with 
Urinary Retention during Days 309-377 (69 days of duration). This patient had a past medical history 
of otitis media, dysphagia and gastro-esophageal reflux s/p gastric tube placement. During treatment 
for pneumonia, the patient was reported to have an AE of deafness, which was mostly likely related to 
AEs of recurrent otitis media, and subsequent bilateral middle ear effusions, which were also reported 
as AEs. 
Patient 2 presented with 3 SAEs (Acute respiratory failure, Bronchiolitis, and Pneumonia bacterial), 
considered by the PI to be of severe intensity, all at Days 237-263 (27 days of duration). The patient 
also experienced narcotic habituation during treatment with morphine while intubated during treatment 
for pneumonia. The opioid habituation resolved 7 days after discontinuation of morphine. All of the 
SAEs were resolved and none of the SAEs were considered by the PI to be treatment-related.

2.2.5.4. Fatal TEAEs and TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation 
There were no deaths or TEAEs leading to discontinuation of IMP during the pilot phase or the OLE 
phase. 
2.2.5.5. TEAEs of Special Interest 
Single events of rash, status epilepticus (severe SAE), urinary retention (severe SAE), drug tolerance, 
and deafness were reported. None of these were considered by the PI to be treatment related. 
Two patients presented multiple episodes of pneumonia, and single episodes of aspiration pneumonia, 
pneumonia bacterial and pneumonia klebsiella between them, during the OLE phase. 
None of these were considered by the PI to be treatment related. 
There were 2 TEAEs of anaemia during the OLE phase, reported in individual patients with 
corresponding low values for haemoglobin and haematocrit. One of the TEAEs was ongoing at the end 
of the trial. 
CHMP comments 
As shown in table 3, the majority of the patients experienced at least one TEAE. There was 
a comparable proportion of patients and a comparable number of AEs in the pilot phase and 
in the pivotal OLE phase. This indicates that AEs were not only reported in beginning of the 
treatment. 
In the pilot phase, 6 patients reported a total of 13 AEs. The majority of AEs were mild in 
intensity, 1 was reported as moderate and 1 as severe. There was 1 reported serious AE 
(SAE)  and  2  patients  experienced  a  total  of  5  events  which  were  considered  treatment 
related.  
In the OLE phase, 7 patients reported a total of 59 AEs. Like the majority of the AEs reported 
in  the  pilot  phase,  the  majority  of  the  AEs  reported  during  the  OLE  phase  were  mild  in 
intensity, 2 were reported as moderate and 2 as severe. There were 2 reported SAEs and 2 
patients experienced a total of 2 events which were considered treatment related.  
Reported AEs are presented in Tables 11.2.1 and 11.2.2 above. The majority of the reported 
AEs were not considered related to study treatment; the only treatment related AEs reported 
were  somnolence,  irritability,  increased  blood  pressure,  diarrhea,  increased  appetite  and 
elevated triglycerides. Of these AEs, irritability, somnolence and diarrhea are all included in 
the tabulated list of adverse reactions, section 4.8 of the SmPC. The severe AE of Status 
epilepticus reported during the pilot phase is most likely related to the underlying disease, 
infantile spasms; likewise for the 2 cases of epilepsy (myoclonic epilepsy (1 case) and Petit 
mal epilepsy (1 case) reported during the OLE phase of the study.

2.2.5.6. Summary of Clinical Laboratory Findings 
Summary results for shifts in haematology and chemistry parameters from baseline to worst post 
baseline and to last observed treatment value based on both reference ranges and toxicity thresholds 
for all patients in the pilot phase and OLE phase of the trial are presented.  
Notably low values were reported after 295 days of treatment for haemoglobin (2 of 9 [22.2%] 
patients), haematocrit (2 of 9 [22.2%] patients), erythrocytes (2 of 9 [11.1%] patients), leukocytes (1 
of 9 [11.1%] patients) and after 127 days for lymphocytes (1 of 9 [11.1%] patients). The patient 
repeat values of low hemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocytes, and leukocytes had been hospitalized 
twice for pneumonia during the period of these low values. The other patient had transient low values 
that were within normal limits at end of study. No other markedly abnormal hematology results were 
observed.

Notably low values were observed for urea nitrogen (2 of 9 [22.2%] patients). Notably high values 
were observed in triglycerides (2 of 9 [22.2%] patients). No other markedly abnormal clinical 
chemistry results were observed. 
2.2.5.7. Summary of Vital Signs, Physical Examinations and ECG 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline for vital signs, physical examinations, and ECG 
in any of the patients in the pilot or OLE phases of the trial. Summary results and changes from 
baseline for vital signs, physical examinations, and ECG are presented.  
The DSMC reviewed the data from the initial 2 weeks of treatment in all 9 patients enrolled, and 
concluded that none of the AE’s raised concerns regarding the safety of the IMP. No additional DSMC 
meetings were planned or called as study enrolment was halted when No Go criteria were met. 
Sponsor maintained pharmacovigilance throughout the OLE treatment, as has been done in all other 
GWP42003-P clinical studies. 
CHMP comments 
During the study, 2 (22.2%) patients reported low values of haemaglobin, haematocrit and 
erythrocytes. The MAH has confirmed that the 2 patients were experiencing low values for 
all parameters Of note there is a mistake in the text above (cited from1) and see red text in 
the  following):  “Notably  low  values  were  reported  after  295  days  of  treatment  for 
haemoglobin (2 of 9 [22.2%] patients), haematocrit (2 of 9 [22.2%] patients), erythrocytes 
(2 of 9 [11.1%] patients),…”. The correct percentage of patients experiencing low values of 
erythrocytes  is  22.2%,  thus,  the  correct  sentence  is  as  follows  with  tracked  changes:  “, 
erythrocytes  (2  of  9  [11.122.2%]  patients),….”  Interestingly,  these  low  values  are  not 
mentioned in the tabulated lists of AEs neither is the cases of decreased lymphocytes and 
low leucocytes nor the 2 cases of low urea nitrogen. This will not be pursued. The 2 cases 
of increased triglycerides are (correctly) reported in the AEs tables; this is endorsed.  
The MAH informs that during the study, there were no clinically relevant changes in baseline 
for  vital  signs,  physical  examinations  and  ECGs.  This  is  agreed  when  reviewing  the 
submitted tables (not included in this assessment report) for absolute values of and changes 
in diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, pulse, ECGs and BMI.  
1) Synoptic Report Body for Study GWEP15100, Title: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol (CBD; GWP42003-P) in infants with infantile 
spasms following an initial open-label pilot study. Page 17.  
3.  Scientific discussion  
Epidyolex (cannabidiol) is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with clobazam, 
for patients 2 years of age and older. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of cannabidiol in the treatment of infantile spasm in patients aged 1 
month to 24 months. The study was designed with an initial pilot phase intending to include 
a total of 10 infants. The study was part of a paediatric investigational plan (PIP) as 
approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Paediatric Committee (PDCO). The 
study design including the study objective, endpoints and planned duration is endorsed. 
Especially, the approach of having predefined Go- and No-go criteria determining the future 
of the trial is fully endorsed as this ensured that the study was not unnecessarily prolonged 
if no clinically relevant effect of the treatment was observed/expected and/or if there were 
unacceptable safety issues. Only patients failing on approved therapies for Infantile spasms 
were included thus, only the most severe and/or treatment refractory patients were 
included.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Page 19/24 
 
 
 
 
After evaluation of 9 patients included in the pilot phase, the study was prematurely terminated as 
none of the 9 patients responded to the treatment as both IS and hypsarrhythmia persisted after 2 
weeks of treatment. Thereby the efficacy-related No-go criteria was met. It may be considered that as 
only severe/treatment refractory patients were included, the result cannot be extrapolated to the 
milder forms of infantile spasms and it remains unclear if cannabidiol can have effect in these patients. 
Of note, the patients were treated with a high dose of cannabidiol (according to the study protocol, 
patients were titrated to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg/kg/day. During the OLE phase, three patients 
had temporary resolution of the spasms and hypsarrhythmia in a period of approximately 1 year, 
though the EEGs were not normal for any of these patients. Furthermore, 2 of these patients had 
initiated concomitant treatment with clobazam. It is considered most likely, that the patients’ disease 
was transforming into another type of epilepsy, which is characteristic for the disease of infantile 
spasms. 
The majority of patients experienced at least one AE both during the pilot phase and during the OLE 
phase. The majority of the AEs were mild in intensity and temporary. Further, only few AEs were 
considered related to the study drug. Most of the serious (and severe) AEs were well-known AEs 
reported for Epidyolex or related to lack of treatment (status epilepticus). 
Conclusively, the MAH for Epidyolex has submitted a synoptic CSR and a clinical overview for the 
Study GWEP15100: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of cannabidiol (CBD; GWP42003 P) in infants with infantile spasms following an initial open label 
pilot study.  
Of the 9 patients treated in the pilot phase with open label GWP42003-P, both IS and hypsarrhythmia 
persisted after 2 weeks of treatment. Thus, the study met the predefined No Go efficacy criteria and 
the study was halted. 
The benefit-risk for Epidyolex (cannabidiol) in the licensed indication for use as adjunctive therapy of 
seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction 
with clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older’ remains positive.  
4.  List of questions 
4.1.  Major objections 
No Major objections have been identified.  
4.2.  Other concerns  
Question 1:  
Considered the known effects of cannabidiol and a total of 3 reports of ‘Irritability’ (1 during 
the pilot phase and 2 during the OLE phase), the MAH is asked to provide more data regarding 
these cases including the temporary relationship, dose and concomitant AEs under the SOC 
‘Nervous  system  disorders’.  The  MAH  should  also  inform  if  Irritability  (or  any  other  mood 
disorders) has been reported among other patients treated with Epidyolex (registration studies 
and post-approval studies), discuss potential biological causality, provide a literature review 
and lastly based on this discussion, consider if ‘Irritability’ should be included in the tabulated 
list  of  adverse  reactions  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  In  this  context  the  SmPC  Guideline1) 
stating “This section should include all adverse reactions from clinical trials, post-authorisation 
safety  studies  and  spontaneous  reporting  for  which,  after  thorough  assessment,  a  causal 
relationship  between  the  medicinal  product  and  the  adverse  event  is  at  least  a  reasonable

possibility, based for example, on their comparative incidence in clinical trials, or on findings 
from epidemiological studies and/or on an evaluation of causality from individual case reports.” 
should be kept in mind.  
Question 2:  
During  the  study,  2  (22.2%)  patients  reported  low  values  of  haemagobin,  haematocrit  and 
erythrocytes. It is expected that this is 2 patients experiencing low values for all parameters; 
please confirm. 
Question 3:  
On page 17 in the Synoptic Report Body for Study GWEP15100, Title: A randomized, double-
blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  cannabidiol  (CBD; 
GWP42003-P) in infants with infantile spasms following an initial open-label pilot study, it is 
stated  that  (red  text  marked  by  the  medical  assessor):  “Notably  low  values  were  reported 
after 295 days of treatment for haemoglobin (2 of 9 [22.2%] patients), haematocrit (2 of 9 
[22.2%] patients), erythrocytes (2 of 9 [11.1%] patients),…”. It is expected that the actual 
number of patients (“2”) is correct percentage (“11.1%”) is wrong; please confirm. 
5.  Assessment of responses (May 2020) 
5.1.  Major objections 
No Major objections were identified.  
5.2.  Other concerns  
Question 1:  
Considered the known effects of cannabidiol and a total of 3 reports of ‘Irritability’ (1 during 
the pilot phase and 2 during the OLE phase), the MAH is asked to provide more data regarding 
these cases including the temporary relationship, dose and concomitant AEs under the SOC 
‘Nervous  system  disorders’.  The  MAH  should  also  inform  if  Irritability  (or  any  other  mood 
disorders) has been reported among other patients treated with Epidyolex (registration studies 
and post-approval studies), discuss potential biological causality, provide a literature review 
and lastly based on this discussion, consider if ‘Irritability’ should be included in the tabulated 
list  of  adverse  reactions  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  In  this  context  the  SmPC  Guideline1) 
stating “This section should include all adverse reactions from clinical trials, post-authorisation 
safety  studies  and  spontaneous  reporting  for  which,  after  thorough  assessment,  a  causal 
relationship  between  the  medicinal  product  and  the  adverse  event  is  at  least  a  reasonable 
possibility, based for example, on their comparative incidence in clinical trials, or on findings 
from epidemiological studies and/or on an evaluation of causality from individual case reports.” 
should be kept in mind.  
MAH’s response: The Marketing Authorisations Holder (MAH) confirms events of irritability 
are  a  common  psychiatric  event  with  cannabidiol  oral  solution  (CBD-OS)  use  and 
acknowledges  the  3  reports  of  irritability  observed  during  the  pilot  phase  and  open-label 
extension (OLE) phase of GWEP15100. 
In the pivotal trials for the indications of Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
(LGS), an imbalance of irritability was noted with CBD-OS use in comparison to placebo. As 
such the MAH has listed irritability as a common psychiatric undesirable effect in section 4.8 
of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) (see SmPC Table 2 below). 
Of note, across the development programme, irritability events were generally non-serious in 
nature and did not lead to discontinuation of CBD-OS.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/116928/2020  
Page 21/24 
 
 
 
 
An important consideration regarding events of irritability is the behavioural and psychiatric 
comorbidities  often  seen  in  patients  with  DS  and  LGS.  The  patient  population  often  has  an 
overlap of comorbidities related to cognition and behavioural disturbances including attention 
deficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  anxiety,  aggressive  behaviour,  psychosis  and  depression 
(Arzimanoglou 2009; Camfield 2011, Dravet 2011). 
The MAH provided the details of the 3 subjects in GWEP15100 who had an adverse event (AE) 
of irritability. 
Subject  1  enrolled  in  GWEP15100  with  a  medical  history  consistent  with  gene  mutation, 
lissencephaly,  dysphagia,  gastroesophageal  reflux,  developmental  delay,  ventriculomegaly, 
and laparoscopic gastrostomy (G-tube). At baseline the subject was concomitantly receiving 
levetiracetam, topiramate, and vigabatrin as well as a ketogenic diet. On Day 26 of the OLE 
phase, the subject experienced irritability that was mild in severity and did not warrant a dose 
change and was considered not related to CBD-OS by the investigator. Clobazam was added 
on Day 210. The event of irritability had not resolved at the point of data cut. 
Subject 2 enrolled in GWEP15100 with a medical history consistent of second degree AV block, 
patent  foramen  ovale,  bilateral  cryptorchidism,  hip  dysplasia,  syndactyly,  abnormal  eye 
movements,  intermittent  constipation,  developmental  delay,  left  axis  deviation,  hypotonia, 
nephrocalcinosis,  intermittent  hiccups,  hair  loss,  diaper  rash,  increased  sweating,  and 
gastrojejunostomy button. At baseline the subject was concomitantly receiving vigabatrin and 
levetiracetam. On Day 24 the subject commenced concomitant treatment with clobazam. On 
Day 57, during the OLE phase, the subject experienced irritability that was mild in nature and 
resolved on Day 91. There was no change in CBD-OS dose, and the event was considered not 
related to CBD-OS by the investigator. Of note, during the AE of irritability the subject also 
experienced AEs of pyrexia from Day 59 to Day 66 and gingival pain from Day 60 to Day 67. 
Subject  3  enrolled  in  GWEP15100  with  a  medical  history  consistent  with  Aicardi  syndrome, 
bilateral  polymicrogyria,  bilateral  retinal  coloboma,  gastroesophageal  reflux,  intracranial 
arachnoid  cysts,  and  hypotonia.  The  subject  was  not  receiving  concomitant  medications  at 
baseline. On Day 1 of the pilot phase of GWEP15100, the subject experienced irritability that 
was  mild  in  nature  and  considered  related  to  CBD-OS  by  the  investigator.  The  subject

recovered on Day 3 without a dose change and continued CBD-OS.It is important to note that 
in trial GWEP15100 these  subjects were titrated up to 40  mg/kg/day  CBD-OS  over 4 days, 
while  hospitalised.  Prior  to  treatment,  the  subjects  underwent  24  hours  of  video 
electroencephalography monitoring. Thus, the occurrence of 3 cases of irritability, given the 
high dose of CBD-OS and the hospitalisation, does not impact the current information provided 
in the SmPC regarding irritability in LGS and DS subjects titrated more slowly, over 1 week to 
10 mg/kg/day, and to a maximum dose of 20 mg/kg/day. 
CHMP comment 
As requested, the MAH has presented short narratives of the three patients who reported 
‘Irritability’ as a (potential) adverse reaction to Epidyolex. This is endorsed. The MAH has 
also, correctly, drawn the attention to the commonly reported comorbidities of behavioural 
and psychiatric disorders in patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; 
it  is  indeed  agreed  that  this  may  be  confounding  factors.  Lastly,  it  is  endorsed  that 
‘Irritability’  is  included  as  a  common  adverse  reaction  in  the  tabulated  list  of  adverse 
reactions in section 4.8 of the Epidyolex SmPC.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved. 
Question 2:  
During  the  study,  2  (22.2%)  patients  reported  low  values  of  haemagobin,  haematocrit  and 
erythrocytes. It is expected that this is 2 patients experiencing low values for all parameters; 
please confirm. 
MAH’s  response:  The  MAH  confirms  that  the  2  (22.2%)  subjects  reporting  low  values  of 
haemoglobin, haematocrit, and  erythrocytes are the same subjects, respectively. Details of 
the events of the subject are provided below. 
Subject  1  enrolled  in  GWEP15100  with  a  medical  history  of  trisomy  21-down  syndrome, 
esotropia,  occasional  constipation,  dysphagia,  developmental  delay,  seasonal  allergies,  and 
laparoscopic  gastrostomy.  The  subject  was  concomitantly  taking  vigabatrin,  clobazam,  and 
zonisamide while maintaining a ketogenic diet. Baseline lab values were within normal range 
for haemoglobin (120 g/L), haematocrit (0.355 fraction of 1), and erythrocytes (4.05 10/L). 
On Day 295, of the OLE phase the subject experienced an AE of anaemia with lower lab values 
than  baseline  of  hemoglobin  (84  g/L),  haematocrit  (0.257  fraction  of  1),  and  erythrocytes 
(2.71 10/L). The AE of anaemia was mild in nature and considered not related to CBD-OS. Of 
note, there was no change in CBD-OS. The event resolved on Day 379 with lab values within 
normal range of haemoglobin (128 g/L), haematocrit (0.381 fraction of 1), and erythrocytes 
(3.86 10/L). 
Subject  2  enrolled  in  GWEP15100  with  a  medical  history  of  neutropenia  LIS1  mutation, 
lissencephaly,  dysphagia,  gastroesophageal  reflux,  developmental  delay,  ventriculomegaly, 
and laparoscopic gastrostomy (G-tube). The subject was concomitantly taking levetiracetam, 
topiramate,  vigabatrin,  clobazam,  diazepam,  and  lorazepam  while  maintaining  a  ketogenic 
diet. Baseline lab  values were within normal range for haemoglobin (119 g/L), haematocrit 
(0.358 fraction of 1), and erythrocytes (4.2 10/L). On Day 237 of the OLE phase the subject 
experienced anaemia that was mild in nature and considered not related to CBD-OS by the 
investigator. Lab values were unavailable for this date. At the point of data cut off, the event 
had not resolved and the subject did not have any changes to CBD-OS dose. 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has confirmed that the 2 (22.2%) patients reporting low values of haemoglobin, 
haematocrit,  and  erythrocytes  are  the  same  patients.  Presentation  of  the  2  patients’ 
narratives is endorsed.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved.

Question 3:  
On page 17 in the Synoptic Report Body for Study GWEP15100, Title: A randomized, double-
blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  cannabidiol  (CBD; 
GWP42003-P) in infants with infantile spasms following an initial open-label pilot study, it is 
stated  that  (red  text  marked  by  the  medical  assessor):  “Notably  low  values  were  reported 
after 295 days of treatment for haemoglobin (2 of 9 [22.2%] patients), haematocrit (2 of 9 
[22.2%] patients), erythrocytes (2 of 9 [11.1%] patients),…”. It is expected that the actual 
number of patients (“2”) is correct and the percentage (“11.1%”) is wrong; please confirm. 
MAH’s response: The MAH confirms the sentence “Notably low values were reported after 
295 days of treatment for haemoglobin (2 of 9 [22.2%] patients), haematocrit (2 of 9 [22.2%] 
patients), erythrocytes (2 of 9 [11.1%] patients),…” did have a typing error. It is confirmed 
that  the  2  subjects  experienced  low  values  of  haemoglobin,  haematocrit,  and  erythrocytes 
with a correct frequency of 22.2% for all the values. 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has confirmed that the correct percentage for the 2 patients who experienced low 
values of haemoglobin, haematocrit, and erythrocytes was 22.2%.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved.

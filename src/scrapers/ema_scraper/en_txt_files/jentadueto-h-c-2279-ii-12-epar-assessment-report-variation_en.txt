2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In August 2011, linagliptin (Trajenta) film-coated tablets 5 mg were approved in the European Union 
(EU/1/11/707) for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approval of an indication 
extension was granted in October 2012 for the use of linagliptin in combination with insulin when insulin 
and metformin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
In July 2012, a fixed-dose combination of linagliptin and metformin (Jentadueto) film-coated tablets (2.5 
mg linagliptin / 850 mg metformin bid and 2.5 mg linagliptin / 1000 mg metformin bid) was approved in 
the European Union (EU/1/12/780) for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The 
approval was granted for the fixed-dose combination of linagliptin and metformin in patients inadequately 
controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or in patients already treated with 
linagliptin and metformin. The fixed-dose combination of linagliptin and metformin is additionally 
indicated as combination therapy with a sulphonylurea in patients inadequately controlled on their 
maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
With the present submission, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) is applying for the use of 
Jentadueto as combination therapy with insulin in adult patients with type 2 diabetes when insulin and 
metformin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
The MAH has based its proof of efficacy for this application on the results of 2 phase III clinical trials 
(1218.36 and 1218.63). 
The proof of efficacy is primarily based on a subset of patients from the pivotal placebo-controlled trial 
1218.36, in which linagliptin was investigated in addition to a background of basal insulin therapy with or 
without oral antidiabetic drugs. Further proof of efficacy is provided by the supportive trial 1218.63, in 
which linagliptin was investigated in elderly patients; this trial included a subset of patients taking insulin 
and metformin as background therapy. The efficacy of the triple combination of linagliptin, metformin, 
and insulin is compared with the combination of placebo, metformin, and insulin. 
An interim report of trial 1218.36 was submitted to the EMA as part of a type II variation to extend the 
indication of Trajenta (linagliptin) to include add-on to insulin. The final study report of 1218.36 has been 
submitted to the EMA within the current application. The final study report for trial 1218.63 was 
submitted to the EMA with the responses to Day 120 questions during the initial Marketing Authorisation 
(MA) evaluation for Jentadueto. 
Both trials were arranged into two relevant efficacy groupings (EFF 1 and EFF-2) and include subsets of 
patients who were treated with both metformin and insulin as background therapy (table 1)

Page 3/31 
  
  
 
 
 
The principal proof of efficacy of the triple combination of linagliptin, metformin, and insulin is based on 
EFF-1, which comprises a subset of patients from the pivotal placebo-controlled trial 1218.36, which 
investigated the efficacy of linagliptin versus placebo as add-on therapy to basal insulin with or without 
oral antidiabetic drugs. All patients from trial 1218.36 who were taking both metformin and insulin as 
background therapy (comprising 82.9% of patients in 1218.36) are included in EFF-1. The primary 
endpoint was the HbA1c change from baseline after 24 weeks; efficacy was also investigated over the 
entire study duration of at least 52 weeks.  
Efficacy in elderly patients is based on EFF-2, which comprises a pooling of elderly patients (≥ 70 years) 
from trials 1218.36 (insulin add-on trial) and 1218.63 (trial conducted in elderly patients) who were 
taking both metformin and insulin as background therapy. The primary endpoint was the HbA1c change 
from baseline after 24 weeks. 
Table 1:  Grouping of studies for the evaluation of efficacy 
A summary of both efficacy groupings is shown in Table 2  below. The vast majority of the treated 
patients had a baseline HbA1c measurement and at least one on-treatment HbA1c measurement and 
patients were therefore included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), the analysis set used for the efficacy 
analyses. Some patients could be included in both efficacy groupings (i.e. patients from trial 1218.36 who 
were aged 70 years or more and were taking both insulin and metformin as background medication).

Methods 
• 
Study participants  
Both 1218.36 and 1218.63 trials included male and female patients who had been diagnosed with type 2 
diabetes and had insufficient glycaemic control. Due to their specific objectives, the studies differed with 
respect to their inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients in 1218.36 had to have a background basal 
insulin therapy (with or without oral antidiabetic therapy with metformin and/or pioglitazone). The 
permitted background medication in study 1218.63 included metformin and/or sulphonylurea and/or 
basal insulin. Patients in both trials completed a 2-week placebo run-in before the first administration of 
study medication. In study 1218.36, patients had to have a BMI of 45 kg/m² or less, while in 1218.63 no 
upper limit for BMI was specified. Patients in study 1218.36 had to be a minimum of 18 years old, while 
patients in study 1218.63 had to be at least 70 years old. In both studies there were no specified 
requirements with respect to upper limit of age or renal impairment status. The required HbA1c lower 
limit at screening was 7.0% for both studies, whereas the upper limit was 10.0% in study 1218.36; for 
study 1218.63 no upper limit was specified. 
Trial 1218.36  
Trial 1218.36 A Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and 
safety study of linagliptin (5 mg), administered orally once daily for at least 52 weeks in type 2 diabetic 
patients in combination with basal insulin therapy 
Objective: The objective of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg versus 
placebo administered for at least 52 weeks as add-on to basal insulin therapy to patients with T2DM and 
insufficient glycaemic control. 
Methods: This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebocontrolled Phase III 
study in patients with T2DM. Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age and were being treated with 
subcutaneous basal insulin alone or in combination with metformin and/or pioglitazone. At screening, 
glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was to be 7.0% to 10.0%, and body mass index (BMI) was to be no 
more than 45 kg/m2. Patients underwent a 2-week placebo run-in period, followed by a randomised, 
double-blind treatment period of at least 52 weeks. During the first 24 weeks of randomised treatment, 
the background dose of basal insulin was to remain stable. After that, the dose of basal insulin could be 
adjusted according to the clinical judgement of the investigator, while the dose of oral antidiabetic drugs 
(metformin and/or pioglitazone) was to remain stable throughout the whole study. 
Endpoints: The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment. 
Superiority of linagliptin over placebo was tested using an ANCOVA, with treatment, concomitant oral 
antidiabetics, and baseline renal function impairment category as fixed classification effects, and baseline 
HbA1c as covariate. Various sensitivity analyses were performed. Secondary endpoints included the treat-
to-target efficacy response (HbA1c <7.0%; HbA1c <6.5%), the relative efficacy response (lowering of 
HbA1c by at least 0.5%), the change from baseline in HbA1c by visit over time, the change from baseline 
in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and the change from baseline in weighted mean daily glucose using the 
8- point blood glucose profile. Other efficacy endpoints were the use of rescue therapy, the incidence of 
asymptomatic hypoglycaemia, and the change in body weight. Safety endpoints included the frequency 
and intensity of AEs, clinically relevant new or worsening findings in physical examination, 12-lead 
electrocardiograms, vital signs, and clinical laboratory parameters.

Trial 1218.63  
Trial 1218.63 A Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, efficacy and safety 
study of linagliptin (5 mg), administered orally once daily over 24 weeks in type 2 diabetic patients (age 
≥ 70 years) with insufficient glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.0%) despite metformin and/or sulphonylurea 
and/or insulin therapy. 
Objective: The objective of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 mg once 
daily versus placebo in elderly patients (≥ 70 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for 24 weeks. 
Methods: This was a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group Phase III 
study in patients with T2DM who were at least 70 years old and had insufficient glycaemic control 
(glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c ≥ 7.0%) despite stable metformin and/or sulphonylurea and/or insulin 
therapy. Patients who successfully completed the screening period underwent a 2-week open-label 
placebo run-in period, which was followed by randomised treatment for 24 weeks and a 1-week follow-up 
period. Doses of background antidiabetic medications were kept stable during screening, run-in, and the 
first 12 weeks of randomised treatment, after which adjustments were permitted. 
Endpoints: The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment. 
Superiority of linagliptin over placebo was tested using an ANCOVA with treatment and prior use of insulin 
as fixed classification effects and baseline HbA1c as linear covariate. Important secondary endpoints were 
the change from baseline in FPG after 24 weeks, occurrence of the treat-to-target response (HbA1c 
<7.0% after 24 weeks), and the occurrence of the relative efficacy response (lowering of HbA1c by at 
least 0.5% after 24 weeks). Safety endpoints included the frequency and intensity of AEs, clinically 
relevant new or worsening findings in physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, and 
clinical laboratory parameters.

• 
Disposition  
For both of the efficacy study groupings, the rate of premature discontinuations up to the timepoint of 
analysis of the primary endpoint at 24 weeks was less than 10% and was lower in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in the placebo+metformin+insulin group. Disposition in the 
efficacy study groupings up to 24 weeks, including the main reasons for premature discontinuation, is 
summarised in Table 3.

The mean HbA1c and FPG values at baseline were similar across efficacy groupings and between the 
treatment groups. The vast majority of patients in both of the efficacy groupings had been diagnosed with 
diabetes for more than 5 years. All patients were taking metformin at baseline; less than 10% of patients 
in each of the efficacy groupings were taking pioglitazone in addition. Sulphonylureas as background 
medication were not permitted in trial 1218.36, from which all patients in EFF-1 were provided. In EFF-2 
(which additionally included patients from trial 1218.63) a total of 9.7% of patients in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and none in the placebo+metformin+insulin group were taking a 
sulphonylurea. Selected baseline characteristics are summarised in the following table.

All patients included in the efficacy study groupings for this submission were treated with insulin as 
background therapy. A prerequisite for participation in trial 1218.36, which provided patients to EFF-1, 
was that patients were treated with basal insulin. Almost half of the patients in EFF-1 (48.6%) were 
taking insulin glargine as their basal insulin therapy, whereas 31.4% were taking Neutral Protamine 
Hagedorn (NPH) insulin and 20.0% were taking insulin detemir. The mean daily basal insulin dose in EFF-
1 was 39.7 IU and was similar for both treatment groups. In the grouping of elderly patients (i.e. EFF-2), 
just over half of the patients (51.9%) were taking insulin glargine, while NPH insulin was taken by 36.1% 
of patients and insulin detemir was taken by 12.0% of patients. The average mean daily dose of insulin in 
EFF-2 was 33.7 IU, and was similar in both treatment groups.  
• 
Change from baseline in HbA1c 
For both of the trials contributing to the evaluation of efficacy in this submission, the primary analysis 
was based on the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment. Because the overall study 
duration of trial 1218.36 was at least 52 weeks, analyses of efficacy over time up to 52 weeks are 
additionally presented for EFF-1. 
In both efficacy groupings, the triple combination of linagliptin, metformin, and insulin provided clinically 
meaningful reductions from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks compared with the combination of placebo, 
metformin, and insulin. The adjusted mean treatment differences were -0.68% for patients from the 
pivotal trial (EFF-1) and -0.81% for the elderly patients (EFF-2) (Table 6).

Because the duration of pivotal trial 1218.36 was at least 52 weeks, changes from baseline in HbA1c after 
52 weeks and over time were analysed for the patients from this trial (EFF-1). This analysis showed that 
the difference between treatment groups in terms of adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c 
increased up to 18 weeks and was sustained up to 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, when the investigators 
could adjust the prescribed basal insulin dose, the difference between treatment groups remained similar 
and was still clinically relevant; at 52 weeks, the adjusted mean treatment difference was -0.58% (95% 
CI: -0.69, -0.47; p<0.0001) (Figure 1).

Proportions of patients achieving HbA1c below 7.0% or HbA1c lowering by at least 0.5% 
Of the patients from the pivotal trial 1218.36 (EFF-1) who had baseline HbA1c of 7.0% or greater, 21.2% 
of those in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 8.4% of those in the placebo+metformin+insulin 
group achieved HbA1c values of less than 7.0% after 24 weeks of treatment. After 52 weeks, which 
included the time during which the insulin dose could be adjusted, 17.0% of the patients in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 6.4% of the patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group 
achieved HbA1c values of less than 7.0%. The proportion of patients that had a reduction in HbA1c of at 
least 0.5% after 24 weeks was higher in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (56.5%) than in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group (22.5%). After 52 weeks, 40.0% of the patients in the

linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 17.0% of the patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group 
achieved HbA1c reductions of at least 0.5%. 
Of the elderly patients (EFF-2) who had baseline HbA1c of 7.0% or greater, 30.0% of those in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 6.9% of those in the placebo+metformin+insulin group achieved 
HbA1c values of less than 7.0% after 24 weeks of treatment. The proportion of patients that had a 
reduction in HbA1c of at least 0.5% after 24 weeks was 62.4% in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group 
and 15.6% in the placebo+metformin+insulin group. 
Change from baseline in FPG 
In EFF-1 (patients taking both metformin and insulin from the placebo-controlled pivotal trial 1218.36), 
the adjusted mean difference between treatment groups with regard to the FPG change from baseline 
was  12.5 mg/dL (95% CI: -17.8, -7.2; p<0.0001). For the grouping of elderly patients (EFF-2), the 
adjusted mean treatment difference was  19.5 mg/dL (95% CI: -33.4, -5.6; p=0.0061), which is in line 
with the results for HbA1c. These results are consistent with findings from previous trials in the linagliptin 
development program. 
Use of rescue medication 
There were slight differences in the definitions of rescue medication in each of the trials contributing 
patients to the efficacy analysis. In 1218.36, the first choice of rescue medication was the adjustment of 
basal insulin therapy; any increase in prescribed insulin dose of more than 10% of the baseline dose was 
regarded as rescue medication. In very rare cases, background therapy could be adjusted or another oral 
antidiabetic medication could be added as rescue medication. In 1218.63, rescue medication was 
considered as any addition of an antidiabetic drug or increase in the dose of background medication for 
more than 7 days. 
For the patients from the pivotal trial 1218.36 (EFF 1), 34.4% of patients in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group required rescue therapy, compared with 48.6% in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group. Of the grouping of elderly patients (EFF-2), 6.5% in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group required rescue medication, compared with 17.8% in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group. 
Change from baseline in insulin dose 
According to the trial protocols, the background insulin dose was to have been maintained at a stable 
level up to 24 weeks for 1218.36 and 12 weeks for 1218.63. Analysis of the mean changes in insulin dose 
in the efficacy groupings showed that mean insulin doses were stable up to the timepoints of the primary 
analysis. For each of the efficacy groupings a smaller proportion of patients in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group had insulin 
dose increases of more than 10% during the period up to the primary endpoint. For the patients from the 
placebo-controlled pivotal trial (EFF-1), the changes in insulin dose were analysed over time including the 
period after 24 weeks during which changes in insulin dose were permitted. During this period, the 
changes in mean basal insulin dose were greater for patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group 
than in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group; the changes from baseline at 52 weeks were 4.4 IU 
(from a baseline of 39.2 IU) in the placebo+metformin+insulin group and 2.4 IU (from a baseline of 40.2 
IU) in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group.  
Change from baseline in body weight 
In each of the efficacy groupings, there were no clinically meaningful effects on body weight in both 
treatment groups (no more than ±1 kg change in adjusted mean weight from baseline) at the timepoint 
of the primary analysis at 24 weeks. The changes in body weight from baseline at 52 weeks were

negligible for both treatment groups in EFF 1.

2.2.1  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Linagliptin 5 mg once daily has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus in combination with several other glucose-lowering medicinal products including metformin and 
basal insulin.  
Jentadueto is a combination of linagliptin 2.5 mg and metformin. Because of the twice daily dosing of 
metformin, the linagliptin 5 mg is divided in two doses of 2.5 mg. Jentadueto twice daily has been 
approved for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with several 
other glucose-lowering medicinal products including metformin, but not insulin.  
With the present submission, Boehringer Ingelheim is applying for the use of Jentadueto as combination 
therapy with insulin.  
Subgroup analyses of two trials investigating linagliptin 5 mg once daily in combination with metformin 
and basal insulin were submitted. The methods of these trials have been assessed in previous 
submissions. The methods of these trials are acceptable.  
No clinical data investigating the effect of Jentadueto in combination with insulin were submitted. 
However, bioequivalence of linagliptin 1 dd 5 mg and linagliptin 2 dd 2.5 mg has been demonstrated 
previously. The effect of insulin on the bioequivalence of linagliptin 1 dd 5 mg and 2 dd 2.5 mg is not 
known, but kinetic data from the clinical studies demonstrate that the trough levels of linagliptin in 
combination with insulin are similar compared to historical data of linagliptin without insulin. These data 
suggest that there is no important pharmacokinetic interaction between linagliptin and insulin. This is also 
supported by the fact that linagliptin is known to have only minor interactions with other drugs. In 
addition, effects of insulin on metabolic and transporter enzymes are considered unlikely. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy of linagliptin in combination with basal insulin is acceptable. The triple combination of linagliptin, 
metformin, and insulin provided clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks 
compared with the combination of placebo, metformin, and insulin. The adjusted mean treatment 
differences were  -0.68% for patients from the pivotal trial and -0.81% for the elderly patients. 
The results of the effects of linagliptin on fasting plasma glucose, the use of rescue medication and the 
proportions of patients achieving HbA1c targets are in line with the effects on HbA1c. Interestingly, the 
patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group needed more insulin than the patients in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group. The changes in body weight from baseline at 52 weeks were 
negligible. 
There were no important differential treatment effects across the subgroups. As previously noted, in 
individuals with diabetes duration less than 1 year, the treatment effect of linagliptin was small. However, 
this is not a major issue, as most patients that will be treated with a combination of linagliptin and insulin 
will have longer diabetes duration. Efficacy of linagliptin is acceptable for the investigated subgroups. 
2.2.2   Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of linagliptin 5 mg once daily in combination with basal insulin and metformin has been 
demonstrated. Due to bioequivalence of linagliptin 5 mg once daily and linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily, the 
CHMP considers the efficacy of Jentadueto in combination with insulin acceptable.

2.3 
 Clinical safety 
This application is supported by safety data from three phase III trials: 1218.36, 1218.43, and 1218.63. 
All studies are randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies investigating linagliptin 5 mg once 
daily compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes as add-on therapy to a background of basal 
insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs.  
For the integrated analysis of safety, data from these trials were pooled in a single safety grouping. This 
grouping includes data from the subset of patients who were taking metformin and insulin as background 
medication. In total, 1079 treated patients are included in the safety analysis presented in this document 
with the main contribution of 1040 patients arising from study 1218.36. Of the treated patients in the 
safety grouping, 530 patients were in the placebo+metformin+insulin group and 549 patients were in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group. 
Exposure 
Planned treatment durations were at least 52 weeks for study 1218.36, 52 weeks for study 1218.43, and 
24 weeks for study 1218.63. Hence, nearly all patients included in this analysis were treated for 24 weeks 
or more (linagliptin+metformin+insulin: 93.6%, placebo+metformin+insulin: 90.9%); the majority of 
patients was treated for 52 weeks or more (linagliptin+metformin+insulin: 82.3%, 
placebo+metformin+insulin: 77.7%). As in study 1218.36 treatment beyond Week 52 was allowed, a 
considerable proportion of patients in the safety grouping was treated for 88 weeks or more 
(linagliptin+metformin+insulin: 8.4%, placebo+metformin+insulin: 10.6%).  
Exposure was generally comparable between the treatment groups; the overall mean (SD) treatment 
exposure was 433 (141.2) days for the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 421 (153.7) days for the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group, and the total exposure to randomised study medication was 651.3 
patient years in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 610.8 patient years in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group.  
Patient disposition and premature discontinuation  
In the safety set, the frequency of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment was lower for the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (12.6%) than for the placebo+metformin+insulin group (16.8%). 
Consistently, the most frequent reasons for premature treatment discontinuation were reported more 
often in the placebo+metformin+insulin group than in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group; these 
reasons were the occurrence of adverse events (linagliptin+metformin+insulin: 4.6%, 
placebo+metformin+insulin: 5.3%), and refusal to continue study medication 
(linagliptin+metformin+insulin: 2.9%, placebo+metformin+insulin: 4.5%).  
Consistent with the overall analysis, for most subgroups analysed, the proportion of patients who 
prematurely discontinued treatment was lower for the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than for the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group; this was consistent for the age categories (≤ 50, 51 to <65, 65 to 
<75, 75 to <85, ≥ 85 years of age), gender subgroups (male, female), baseline BMI categories (<30, 
≥ 30 kg/m2), baseline HbA1c categories (<8.5%, ≥ 8.5%), renal function subgroups (≥ 90, <90 mL/min), 
and baseline insulin daily dose categories (≤ 40, >40 IU). Exceptions were noted for the subgroup of 
Black patients (N= 46), where the rate of premature treatment discontinuation was higher in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (34.8%) when compared with the placebo+metformin+insulin group 
(17.4%); the difference arose solely due to 2 patients in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group who 
refused to continue trial medication and 2 patients who were lost to follow up. There was no difference 
between the treatment groups in the frequency of Black patients who discontinued due to adverse events.

Further subgroups with a slightly higher treatment discontinuation rate in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in the placebo+metformin+insulin group were the subgroup of 
Asian patients, patients from Asia, and patients who were diagnosed with diabetes for more than 1 and 
up to 5 years. 
Adverse events 
The analysis of adverse events was based on the concept of treatment-emergent signs and symptoms, 
i.e. adverse events not present at start of treatment or events present at start of treatment that worsen 
during treatment in intensity were analysed. All adverse events occurring between first drug intake and 
up to and including Day 7 after last drug intake were assigned to the randomised treatment. Adverse 
event analyses are based on the number of patients with adverse events, not the number of adverse 
events.  
The types of the adverse events analysed for the SCS include all adverse events, all adverse events by 
intensity, investigator-defined drug-related adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation of 
study medication, adverse events leading to death, serious adverse events, other significant adverse 
events (based on the ICH E3 definition), hypoglycaemic events, and 8 categories of adverse events of 
special interest.  
A summary of adverse events in the safety grouping is presented in Table 9 below. Overall, the 
proportion of patients with at least one adverse event reported in the on-treatment phase, were 
comparable between the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and the placebo+metformin+insulin group. 
Proportions of patients with severe adverse events, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, 
and investigator-defined hypoglycaemic events were similar in both treatment groups. Serious adverse 
events were slightly more frequent in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group. Investigator-defined drug-related adverse events were more common 
in the placebo+metformin+insulin group when compared with the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group. 
The proportions of patients with adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were generally low for all 
types of AESIs; no patient was reported with AESIs defined as pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, or 
thyroid neoplasm (unspecified). The AESI reported with the highest frequency was hepatic adverse 
events; with a higher frequency in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (16 patients [2.9%]) than in 
the placebo+metformin+insulin group (8 patients [1.5%]). Pancreatitis was reported for 3 patients 
(0.5%) in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 1 patient (0.2%) in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group.

Most frequently reported adverse events 
In the safety grouping, the most frequently reported adverse events on the MedDRA system organ class 
(SOC) level with an incidence of more than 20% of patients in a treatment group were metabolism and 
nutrition disorders, infections and infestations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and 
gastrointestinal disorders. Proportions of patients in each SOC were generally similar in both treatment 
groups. 
Overall, the most frequently reported adverse events on the MedDRA preferred term (PT) level with an 
incidence of more than 10% in a treatment group were hypoglycaemia (with similar frequencies in both 
treatment groups), hyperglycaemia (more frequent in the placebo+metformin+insulin group), and 
nasopharyngitis (with similar frequencies in both treatment groups). All adverse events reported with a 
frequency of more than 5% in any treatment group are presented in Table 10.  
Preferred terms that were noted with a difference in frequency of more than 2% between the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and the placebo+metformin+insulin group were hyperglycaemia 
(13.1% vs. 17.4%) and gastroenteritis (2.2% vs. 4.7%).

Drug-related adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation 
Overall, proportions of patients reported with adverse events leading to premature treatment 
discontinuation were low in the safety grouping and similar between the treatment groups 
(linagliptin+metformin+insulin: 23 patients [4.2%], placebo+metformin+insulin: 25 patients [4.7%]). 
Generally, for all SOCs, proportions of patients with adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
were below 1.0% in both treatment groups; except for the SOC gastrointestinal disorders, which was 
reported for more patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group (7 patients [1.3%]) than in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (3 patients [0.5%]). Only a few preferred terms were reported by 2 
patients in a treatment group. There was no indication that treatment with linagliptin on a background of 
metformin and insulin increased the rate of adverse events leading to premature discontinuation when 
compared with placebo treatment on a background of metformin and insulin.  
The proportion of patients with investigator-defined drug-related adverse events in the safety grouping 
was higher in the placebo+metformin+insulin group (21.5%) than in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin 
group (18.2%). The SOC most frequently reported for investigator-defined drug-related adverse events 
was metabolism and nutrition disorders (linagliptin+metformin+insulin: 13.3%, 
placebo+metformin+insulin: 15.1%). The most frequently reported drug-related adverse event at PT 
level was hypoglycaemia with a higher frequency in the placebo+metformin+insulin group (75 patients 
[14.2%]) than in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (69 patients [12.6%]). Hence, treatment with 
linagliptin compared with placebo on a background of metformin and insulin did not increase the 
incidence of drug-related adverse events in the investigated patient population.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Of the 1079 treated patients in this safety analysis, 6 patients died; 3 patients were in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group, 3 patients were in the placebo+metformin+insulin group. All fatal 
events were reported in study 1218.36, which contributed most patients to the safety grouping (1040 of 
1079 treated patients). Of the patients in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group who died, 2 patients 
were reported with sudden death, 1 patient with myocardial infarction. Of the patients in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group who died, 2 patients were reported with non-small cell lung cancer, 
and 1 patient was reported with acute renal failure. All patients died in the on-treatment period. None of 
the events was considered related to trial medication. The incidence rates per 100 patient years were 
similar in the treatment groups: 4.53 for the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 4.83 for the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group.  
Overall, in the analysed patient population, the frequency of serious adverse events (including fatal 
adverse events) was low. In the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group 13.8% of patients and 12.8% of 
patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group were reported with serious adverse events. The SOC 
with the highest frequency of serious adverse events was cardiac disorders, reported for similar 
frequencies of patients in both treatment groups (linagliptin+metformin+insulin: 2.9%, 
placebo+metformin+insulin: 2.8%). On the PT level, no event was reported with a frequency of more 
than 1.0% .  
Based on preferred terms, serious adverse events with an incidence of more than 0.2% (i.e. 1 or more 
patients) in either treatment group and reported for more patients in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin 
group than the placebo+metformin+insulin group were angina unstable (0.5% vs. 0.2%), acute 
myocardial infarction (0.4% vs. 0.0%), cataract (0.4% vs. 0.0%), gastric ulcer (0.4% vs. 0.2%), sudden 
death (0.4% vs. 0.0%), bronchitis (0.4% vs. 0.0%), fall (0.5% vs. 0.4%), contusion (0.4% vs. 0.0%), 
ligament sprain (0.4% vs. 0.2%), road traffic accident (0.4% vs. 0.2%), hypoglycaemia (0.4% vs. 
0.0%), ovarian adenoma (0.4% vs. 0.2%), and nephrolithiasis (0.4% vs. 0.0%). 
Adverse events of special interest  
Hypoglycaemia 
The frequency of reported on-treatment hypoglycaemic events was similar in both treatment groups, 
ranging from 29.1% to 30.9% of patients. Consistently, similar proportions of patients were reported with 
investigator-defined hypoglycaemic events in both treatment groups irrespective of severity and also for 
severe hypoglycaemic events, i.e. those requiring assistance (linagliptin+metformin+insulin: 1.5%, 
placebo+metformin+insulin: 0.9%).  
In the study which contributed the majority of patients to this safety analysis (1218.36), hypoglycaemic 
events were analysed and compared for the first 24 weeks of treatment, where the basal insulin dose was 
to remain stable, and for the following period up to the end of treatment, where the basal insulin dose 
could be adjusted. Overall, there was no difference between the placebo and linagliptin treatment groups 
for the proportion of patients with investigator-reported hypoglycaemic events up to Week 24 and after 
Week 24 to the end of treatment. 
Other adverse events of special interest  
Overall, proportions of patients with adverse events of special interest were low for all types of adverse 
events of special interest. No patients were reported with pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, or thyroid

neoplasm (unspecified). The adverse events of special interest reported with the highest frequency was 
hepatic adverse events; the frequency was higher in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (2.9%) 
when compared with the placebo+metformin+insulin group (1.5%). Also slightly more patients in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in the placebo+metformin+insulin group were reported with 
hypersensitivity adverse events (1.8% vs.1.3%) mainly due to urticaria (0.7% vs. 0.2%), drug-related 
gastrointestinal adverse reaction (1.3% vs. 0.8%) mainly due to nausea (1.1% vs. 0.4%), thyroid 
neoplasm (benign) (0.4% vs. 0.0%), and cutaneous skin reactions (0.2% vs. 0.0%). Renal adverse 
events were reported by more patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group compared to the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (0.8% vs. 0.5%.).  
In the safety grouping, 4 patients were reported with pancreatitis. Three of those patients were treated 
with linagliptin+metformin+insulin, two of which required hospitalisation due to the event; none of the 
events was reported as having a severe intensity. One patient in the placebo+metformin+insulin group 
was reported with severe pancreatitis and required hospitalisation due to the event. None of the cases 
were fatal, necrotising, or haemorrhagic.  
Cardiovascular safety 
The number of patients who were analysed for the primary endpoint in this meta-analysis were 5847 
patients treated with linagliptin, 2675 patients treated with placebo, and 937 patients treated with an 
active comparator. The primary composite endpoint was composed of the adjudicated events CV death, 
non-fatal myocardial ischaemia (MI), non-fatal stroke, and hospitalisation due to unstable angina. For the 
primary endpoint, incidence event rates (per 1000 years of exposure) were 13.4 for linagliptin and 18.9 
for the total comparators. For the secondary endpoint 'all adjudicated events', incidence event rates were 
21.5 for linagliptin and 29.1 for the combined comparators; for the 'FDA custom MACE' incidence event 
rates were 8.7 for linagliptin and 13.7 for the combined comparators; and for 'CV death, MI and stroke', 
incidence event rates were 9.3 for linagliptin and 14.0 for the combined comparators. 
The subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint revealed an incidence rate of 29.8 for linagliptin and 27.5 
for all comparators for patients on insulin background, of 10.9 for linagliptin and 16.3 for all comparators 
for patients on metformin background, and 21.3 for linagliptin and 16.2 for all comparators for patients 
on metformin and insulin background. For the safety analysis in this application, the primary composite 
cardiovascular endpoint as defined for the meta-analysis was analysed. Of the 549 treated patients in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group, 14 patients (2.6%) had CEC-confirmed events as defined by this 
endpoint; giving rise to an incidence rate of 21.3 patients with events per 1000 patient years (PY) at risk. 
Of the 530 treated patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group, 10 patients (1.9%) had such 
events, leading to an incidence rate of 16.2/1000 PY.  
A second endpoint was analysed for this application based on FDA custom MACE events. For this 
endpoint, number of patients with events and incidence rates were similar in the treatment groups: in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group, 6 patients (1.1%) were reported with such events (incidence rate: 
9.1/1000 PY); in the placebo+metformin+insulin group, 5 patients were reported with such events 
(incidence rate: 8.1/1000 PY).  
Laboratory findings and vital signs 
In the safety grouping, no clinically meaningful changes from baseline or clinically meaningful differences 
between the treatment groups were observed for haematology parameters, electrolytes, enzymes, 
substrates, and urinalysis parameters. There were changes in mean (SD) amylase values; they increased 
from baseline by 5 (20) U/L in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group until the end of treatment, 
whereas in the placebo+metformin+insulin group a change by -1 (21) U/L was noted. Furthermore, for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/758426/2013

amylase a higher proportion of patients in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (4.5%) than in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group (2.9%) shifted from normal values at baseline to high values at the 
end of treatment. Analyses for possibly clinically significant abnormalities of increased amylase confirmed 
the above mentioned findings, with more patients in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (5.6%) than 
in the placebo+metformin+insulin group (3.3%).  
Only few patients were reported with any of the pre-specified criteria for liver enzyme elevations, most 
commonly they were from the placebo+metformin+insulin group. One patient in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group and no patient in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group had a lab 
constellation consistent with potential Hy's law. Mean changes from baseline to last value on treatment 
were small for all liver enzymes analysed; no relevant differences were noted for the treatment groups. 
However, shifts from low or normal values at baseline towards high values at the end of treatment were 
more common in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in the placebo+metformin+insulin group 
for AST (5.8% vs. 2.7%) and ALT (4.6% vs. 3.2%).  
Changes in renal function were evaluated by categorising the estimated creatinine clearance rate (eCcr) 
based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Patients were categorised as having normal renal function (eCcr 
≥ 90 mL/min), mild renal impairment (eCcr 60 to <90 mL/min), moderate renal impairment (eCcr 30 to 
<60 mL/min), severe renal impairment (eCcr 15 to <30 mL/min), or end-stage renal disease (eCcr <15 
mL/min) at baseline and at the end of treatment.  
An analysis over time performed for patients from trial 1218.36 only (i.e. the majority [96%] of patients 
in the pooled safety analysis) showed a greater reduction in mean eCCR over time in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in the placebo+metformin+insulin group, however, this 
difference disappeared after adjustment for changes in weight.  35 patients (10.5%) in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 29 patients (8.8%) in the placebo+metformin+insulin group 
shifted from normal values at baseline to microalbuminuria at the end of treatment: 12 patients (7.8%) 
in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 9 patients (6.7%) in the placebo+metformin+insulin 
group shifted from microalbuminuria at baseline to macroalbuminuria at the end of treatment; 3 patients 
(0.9%) in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and 2 patients (0.6%) in the 
placebo+metformin+insulin group shifted from normal values at baseline to macroalbuminuria at the end 
of treatment. However, the differences were small and statistical comparisons of the number of patients 
with deteriorations by means of the Chi-square test did not reveal any indication for a difference between 
treatment groups (p=0.44 for last value on treatment, p=0.95 for worst value on treatment). 
When observing timepoints beyond Week 18 until Week 91, for patients from study 1218.36 only, mean 
SBP slightly decreased (by a maximum of -3.2 mmHg from baseline at Week 65) in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group, whereas mean SBP slightly increased towards the end of the 
treatment (by a maximum of 2.9 mmHg from baseline at Week 91) in the placebo+metformin+insulin 
group. Mean changes in DBP and pulse rate from baseline until the end of treatment were negligible in 
both treatment groups.  
Post marketing experience 
The overall cumulative marketed patient exposure to Jentadueto is estimated to be 9008 PY for the time 
period 30 Jan 2012 to 31 Dec 2012. The first Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) for Jentadueto covers 
a reporting interval of 20 Jul 2012 to 19 Jan 2013. The interval patient exposure was estimated to be 
6740 patient years. 
In total, 46 cases (confirmed by healthcare professionals and non-confirmed cases) were reported, of 
which 3 cases were serious and 43 cases were non-serious. None of the cases were assessed as requiring 
a change to the safety profile as described in the company core data sheet (CCDS dated 14 December 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/758426/2013 
Page 19/31 
  
  
 
2012). The majority of the non-serious cases appeared to describe listed adverse events such as 
gastrointestinal upset, rash, or cough, or events that are associated with diabetes such as hypoglycaemia 
and peripheral neuropathy. The serious cases were one case of lactic acidosis, one poorly reported case 
of hypokalaemia, and one case of rhabdomyolysis in a patient with concomitant simvastatin medication. 
Overall, no case of pancreatitis was reported from spontaneous sources until datalock point of the PSUR. 
2.3.1.   Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of Jentadueto in combination with basal insulin appears comparable to the safety of linagliptin 
in combination with metformin and basal insulin.  
The frequency of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment was lower for the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (12.6%) than for the placebo+metformin+insulin group (16.8%). 
Demographic data were generally balanced across the two treatment groups. Overall, the proportion of 
patients with at least one adverse event reported in the on-treatment phase, were comparable between 
the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and the placebo+metformin+insulin group (78.0% vs. 80.6%). 
Proportions of patients with severe adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment 
discontinuation were similar in both treatment groups (7.3% vs. 8.5% and 4.2% vs. 4.7%, respectively). 
Serious adverse events were slightly more frequent in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in 
the placebo+metformin+insulin group (13.8% vs. 12.8%). There were no relevant differences in 
proportions of patients reported with adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation. 
There was no evidence that treatment with linagliptin compared with placebo in patients with metformin 
and basal insulin background led to an increase in hypoglycaemic events.  
The frequency of hepatic adverse events was slightly higher in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group 
(2.9%) when compared with the placebo+metformin+insulin group (1.5%). The side effect hepatic 
events is stated in the SmPC.  Also slightly more patients in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than 
in the placebo+metformin+insulin group were reported with hypersensitivity adverse events (1.8% 
vs.1.3%). Hypersensitivity adverse events have already been mentioned in the SmPC.  
There was an increased risk of pancreatitis, but this risk is in line with previous findings with linagliptin 
(and other DPP-4 inhibitors) and is listed in the SmPC of Jentadueto. 
Compared to the combination of placebo and active comparator on a background of metformin and 
insulin, cardiovascular events in the group of patients treated with linagliptin were slightly increased 
(2.6% vs. 1.9%). However, the absolute number of events was low and results are considered 
inconclusive. Further data from the ongoing cardiovascular outcome study (study 1218.74) is awaited.  
An analysis over time performed for patients from trial 1218.36 only (i.e. the majority [96%] of patients 
in the pooled safety analysis) showed a greater reduction in mean eCCR over time in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in the placebo+metformin+insulin group, however, this 
difference disappeared after adjustment for changes in weight. There were differences in deteriorations of 
microalbuminuria, However, the differences were small and statistical comparisons of the number of 
patients with deteriorations by means of the Chi-square test did not reveal any indication for a difference 
between treatment groups (p=0.44 for last value on treatment, p=0.95 for worst value on treatment). 
There was a small decrease in SBP with linagliptin compared to placebo. DBP and pulse were similar.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/758426/2013 
Page 20/31 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of the non-serious postmarketing cases appeared to describe listed adverse events. The 
serious post marketing cases were rare and for now no conclusions can be drawn.  
There were several differences in the risk of adverse events in different subgroups: in some subgroups 
linagliptin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, whereas in other subgroups placebo was 
associated with a higher risk. These differences are likely to be due to numerical imbalances. 
2.3.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of Jentadueto in combination with basal insulin appears comparable to the safety of linagliptin 
in combination with metformin and insulin. However, an increased risk of hepatic events cannot be 
excluded. The side effect hepatic events has been therefore included in the SmPC. 
2.3.  Risk management plan 
2.3.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan, version 8.0, dated 13 November 2013 the 
PRAC considers by consensus that the risk management system for Linagliptin+metformin (Jentadueto) 
in the treatment of approved indication is acceptable.  
Advice on conditions of the marketing authorisation  
The PRAC do not advise any changes to the current conditions of the Marketing Authorisation. 
Risk management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

2.4.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
“Jentadueto is indicated in combination with insulin (i.e. triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to 
diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients when insulin and metformin alone do 
not provide adequate glycaemic control.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/758426/2013 
Page 25/31 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
“For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with insulin and the maximal tolerated 
dose of metformin 
The dose of Jentadueto should provide linagliptin dosed as 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily dose) and 
a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When linagliptin plus metformin 
hydrochloride is used in combination with insulin, a lower dose of insulin may be required to reduce the 
risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).” 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
“Sulphonylureas and insulin are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, caution is advised when 
Jentadueto is used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin. A dose reduction of the 
sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered (see section 4.2).” 
“Use of Jentadueto in combination with insulin 
The use of Jentadueto in combination with insulin has not been adequately studied.” 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
“Adverse reactions reported when linagliptin and metformin were combined with insulin 
When linagliptin and metformin were administered in combination with insulin, hypoglycaemia was the most 
frequently reported adverse reaction, but occurred at comparable rate when placebo and metformin were 
combined with insulin (linagliptin plus metformin plus insulin 29.5% versus 30.9% in the placebo plus 
metformin plus insulin group) with a low rate of severe episodes (1.5% versus 0.9%).” 
“Adverse reactions reported when linagliptin and metformin were combined with insulin  
When linagliptin and metformin were administered in combination with insulin, constipation was identified 
as an additional adverse reaction under these conditions. The combination of linagliptin and metformin 
when administered in combination with insulin may be associated with an increased risk of hepatic events.”

5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
“Linagliptin in combination with metformin and insulin 
A 24-week placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin (5 mg 
once daily) added to insulin with or without metformin. 83% of patients were taking metformin in 
combination with insulin in this trial. Linagliptin in combination with metformin plus insulin provided 
significant improvements in HbA1c in this subgroup with -0.68% (CI: -0.78; -0,57) adjusted mean change 
from baseline (mean baseline HbA1c 8.28%) compared to placebo in combination with metformin plus 
insulin. There was no meaningful change from baseline in body weight in either group.” 
“In a pooled analysis of elderly (age ≥ 70 years) patients with type 2 diabetes (n=183) who were taking both 
metformin and basal insulin as background therapy, linagliptin in combination with metformin plus insulin 
provided significant improvements in HbA1c parameters with -0.81% (CI: -1.01; -0.61) adjusted mean 
change from baseline (mean baseline HbA1c 8.13%) compared to placebo in combination with metformin 
plus insulin” 
The Package leaflet was updated to reflect the new indication in combination with insulin.

3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Linagliptin 5 mg once daily has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus in combination with several other glucose-lowering medicinal products including metformin and 
basal insulin.  
 Jentadueto is a combination of linagliptin 2.5 mg and metformin. Jentadueto twice daily has been 
approved for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with several 
other glucose-lowering medicinal products including metformin, but not insulin. Because of the twice daily 
dosing of metformin, the linagliptin 5 mg is divided in two doses of 2.5 mg. 
With the present submission, the MAH is applying for the use of Jentadueto as combination therapy with 
basal insulin.  
Subgroup analyses of two trials investigating linagliptin 5 mg once daily in combination with metformin 
and insulin were submitted. The triple combination of linagliptin, metformin, and insulin provided clinically 
meaningful reductions from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks compared with the combination of placebo, 
metformin, and insulin. The adjusted mean treatment differences were  -0.68% for patients from the 
pivotal trial and -0.81% for the elderly patients. 
The results of the effects of linagliptin on fasting plasma glucose, the use of rescue medication and the 
proportions of patients achieving HbA1c targets are in line with the effects on HbA1c. Interestingly, the 
patients in the placebo+metformin+insulin group needed more insulin than the patients in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group. The changes in body weight from baseline at 52 weeks were 
negligible. 
There were no important differential treatment effects across the subgroups.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No clinical data investigating the effect of Jentadueto in combination with insulin were submitted. 
However, bioequivalence of linagliptin 1 dd 5 mg and linagliptin 2 dd 2.5 mg has been demonstrated 
previously. The effect of insulin on the bioequivalence of linagliptin 1 dd 5 mg and 2 dd 2.5 mg is not 
known, but kinetic data from the clinical studies demonstrate that the trough levels of linagliptin in 
combination with insulin are similar compared to historical data of linagliptin without insulin. These data 
suggest that there is no important pharmacokinetic interaction between linagliptin and insulin. This is also 
supported by the fact that linagliptin is known to have only minor interactions with other drugs. In 
addition, effects of insulin on metabolic and transporter enzymes are considered unlikely. 
As previously noted, in individuals with diabetes duration less than 1 year, the treatment effect of 
linagliptin was small. However, this is not a major issue, as most patients that will be treated with a 
combination of linagliptin and insulin will have longer diabetes duration. Efficacy of linagliptin is 
acceptable for the investigated subgroups.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety of Jentadueto in combination with basal insulin is likely to be comparable to the safety of 
linagliptin in combination with metformin and basal insulin.  
The frequency of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment was lower for the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group (12.6%) than for the placebo+metformin+insulin group (16.8%). 
Overall, the proportion of patients with at least one adverse event reported in the on-treatment phase, 
were comparable between the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group and the placebo+metformin+insulin 
group (78.0% vs. 80.6%). Proportions of patients with severe adverse events and adverse events leading 
to treatment discontinuation were similar in both treatment groups (7.3% vs. 8.5% and 4.2% vs. 4.7%, 
respectively). Serious adverse events were slightly more frequent in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin 
group than in the placebo+metformin+insulin group (13.8% vs. 12.8%). There were no relevant 
differences in proportions of patients reported with adverse events leading to premature treatment 
discontinuation. 
There was no evidence that treatment with linagliptin compared with placebo in patients with metformin 
and insulin background led to an increase in hypoglycaemic events.  
The frequency of hepatic adverse events was slightly higher in the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group 
(2.9%) when compared with the placebo+metformin+insulin group (1.5%). Also slightly more patients in 
the linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in the placebo+metformin+insulin group were reported with 
hypersensitivity adverse events (1.8% vs.1.3%).  
There was an increased risk of pancreatitis, which is in line with previous findings with linagliptin (and 
other DPP-4 inhibitors). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Compared to the combination of placebo and active comparator on a background of metformin and 
insulin, cardiovascular events in the group of patients treated with linagliptin were slightly increased 
(2.6% vs. 1.9%). However, the absolute number of events was low and results are considered 
inconclusive.  
An analysis over time performed for patients from trial 1218.36 only (i.e. the majority [96%] of patients 
in the pooled safety analysis) showed a greater reduction in mean eCCR over time in the 
linagliptin+metformin+insulin group than in the placebo+metformin+insulin group, however, this 
difference disappeared after adjustment for changes in weight. There were differences in deteriorations of 
microalbuminuria. However, the differences were small and statistical comparisons of the number of 
patients with deteriorations by means of the Chi-square test did not reveal any indication for a difference 
between treatment groups (p=0.44 for last value on treatment, p=0.95 for worst value on treatment). In 
addition, in the overall linagliptin development program, there was no sign of a decrease in renal 
function. In the dedicated trial conducted in patients with severe chronic renal impairment, there was also 
no evidence of clinically meaningful changes in renal function for patients treated with linagliptin 
compared with placebo over 52 weeks.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The triple combination of linagliptin, metformin, and basal insulin provided reductions from baseline in 
HbA1c after 24 weeks compared with the combination of placebo, metformin, and insulin. These 
reductions may be clinically relevant and associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease. The 
absolute number of vascular events was low and results are considered inconclusive. Further data from 
the ongoing cardiovascular outcome study (study 1218.74) is awaited. 
The effect of insulin on the bioequivalence of linagliptin 1 dd 5 mg and 2 dd 2.5 mg is not known, but 
kinetic data from the clinical studies demonstrate that the trough levels of linagliptin in combination with 
insulin are similar compared to historical data of linagliptin without insulin. 
The safety of Jentadueto in combination with insulin appears comparable to the safety of linagliptin in 
combination with metformin and basal insulin. However, there is an increased frequency of hepatic events 
with linagliptin/metformin in combination with insulin. This information has been included in the SmPC.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of Jentadueto with basal insulin appears to be similar to that of linagliptin in 
combination with metformin and basal insulin.  
Linagliptin with metformin and insulin is not associated with hypoglycaemia and weight gain. There was 
an increased risk of hypersensitivity adverse events and pancreatitis, but these risks are in line with 
previous findings with linagliptin (and other DPP-4 inhibitors) and are listed in the SmPC of Jentadueto. 
The side effect hepatic events has been included in the SmPC. 
The results of the cardiovascular outcome trial are awaited.

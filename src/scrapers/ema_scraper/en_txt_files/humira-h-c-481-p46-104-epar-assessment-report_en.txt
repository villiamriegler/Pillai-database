Introduction 
On 22 November 2017, the MAH submitted the final study report for P15-619 (Post- Marketing 
Surveillance of Humira in Korean Paediatric CD Patients under the “New-Drug Re-examination”) for 
Humira, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. This is a Post 
Authorisation Measure (PAM). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The applicant states that the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance and therefore do 
not require taking further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
In Korea, the paediatric CD indication for adalimumab (Humira®) was approved in September 2013. 
Study P15-619 was set up as a Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study as per the New Drug Re-
examination Guideline in Korea. The requirements in Korea are that a PMS study is conducted for each 
new compound or each new indication of an approved compound. The aim of the study was to evaluate 
the safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in Korea paediatric patients with moderate to severe 
Crohn's disease (CD). 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
Paediatric patients who were prescribed Humira as per physician's medical judgment in accordance 
with the approved SmPC were enrolled in the study. 
The MAH states that as this is a post marketing surveillance, the MAH was NOT involved in the product 
supply since the drug was being used according to the approved marketing label and was to be 
prescribed by the physician under usual and customary practice of physician prescription. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted the final study report for P15-619 (Post- Marketing Surveillance of Humira in 
Korean Paediatric CD Patients under the “New-Drug Re-examination”).

4. Non-serious adverse drug reaction 
5. Adverse events resulting from drug misuse, drug abuse or drug interaction 
6. Other information related to the product's safety and effectiveness (including the influence to the 
laboratory value) 
Study design 
This study was a non-interventional, observational study of Humira in the treatment of paediatric CD 
as per the New Drug Re-examination Guideline in Korea. Paediatric patients who were prescribed 
Humira as per physician's medical judgment in accordance with the approved SmPC were enrolled in 
the study. 
Patients were observed for 6 months following first dose of Humira. 
Study population /Sample size 
Study population 
All patients who were prescribed Humira for paediatric CD treatment during the surveillance period and 
who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study until the assigned number of 
subjects were registered at the site: 
Inclusion Criteria 
1. Paediatric patients with Crohn's Disease who are prescribed Humira in accordance with the Korean 
label for Humira authorization (labeling). 
2. Patients who have given written authorization or patients whose legal representatives have given it 
to use their personal health data for the purposes of this study. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Patient with any of the following was not registered in this surveillance: 
1. Any contraindications to Humira as listed on the approved product market authorization (labeling) 
2. Patients who is participating on other clinical trials. 
Study Size and Study Duration 
This Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS) was planned to recruit 600 subjects for 4 years to meet the 
local requirements for regulatory PMS. However, according to the MAH, the number of subjects to be 
enrolled was adjusted to 141 subjects because of: 1) Low incidence and prevalence of Paediatric CD, 
and 2) Criteria for using biologics for Paediatric CD (as Humira is indicated only for a subgroup of CD 
patients, only a very limited number of patients with the disease receives the drug) and 3) Difficulties 
in getting patients' consents. 
The study actually enrolled 152 subjects from 13 study sites during the PMS study period (4 years, 13 
September 2013 through 12 September 2017), see further below.  
The study duration designated by MFDS (Ministry of Food and Drug Safety) was from 13 September 
2013 to 12 September 2017. The study was started after the launch of the product as a new drug for 
paediatric CD and the final report was to be submitted to MFDS by 11 December 2017. Interim study

reports were submitted to MFDS every 6 months for the first 2 years, then annually thereafter during 
PMS period. 
Treatments 
Patients were administered Humira as per the package label. Unit dose, frequency and length of 
treatment (start date, end date) were recorded on the appropriate case report form. 
Concomitant medications, including TB prophylaxis regimen, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, 
were recorded and included: generic name (brand name in case of combination drug), total daily dose, 
length of administration (start date and end date), indications. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Variables were Demographics, Medical History, PPD Skin Test, Chest X-ray, Interferon Gamma Release 
Assay, Concomitant Medication, Safety, PCDAI score (CDAI score if it was evaluated). 
Regardless of results of causality assessment, presence of adverse event(s), type of adverse event(s), 
onset, end date, severity, causality assessment by physician on the adverse event(s), action taken, 
outcome were captured, during the study, from the first administration to the surveillance period 
(Safety data was collected from informed consent to up to 70 days following the last administration of 
Humira). 
Statistical Methods 
Justification for the Planned Sample Size 
The sample size of 600 had been selected in order to give at least 95% probability of detecting at least 
one uncommon SAE that occurs in the Korean patient population at a rate of at least 0.5%. This 
estimate was based on the assumption that the occurrence of AEs has a Poisson distribution and that if 
the population rate of occurrence of an AE is 0.5% then the expected number of AEs in the proposed 
sample size of 600 would be 3. The probability of observing 1 or more events with a Poisson parameter 
of 3 is 0.95 or 95%. 
Analysis Population 
The safety analysis data set includes all subjects who have received at least one administration of 
Humira following the initiation of surveillance and have completed follow up for the safety information. 
For induction effectiveness of Humira, the effectiveness analysis data set includes all subjects who 
have been administered Humira and prescribed Humira for 4 weeks including induction period (± 1 
week) and for whom effectiveness evaluation parameters have been recorded. And for maintenance 
effectiveness of Humira, effectiveness analysis data set includes all subjects who have been 
administered Humira and prescribed Humira for 6 months (± 4 weeks) and for whom effectiveness 
evaluation parameters have been recorded. 
Safety Analysis 
The number and percentage of subjects reporting any serious adverse events/adverse drug reactions 
were tabulated. 
If the incidence of adverse events in the subjects who began the administration before/after the 
registration date was statistically significant, it was presented as a separate item. In addition, if there 
are patients who have already been administered Humira when participating in the surveillance, their 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/501355/2018

adverse events from the first administration of Humira to the inclusion were presented in a separate 
table. 
Effectiveness Analysis 
The effectiveness assessment of Humira induction therapy and maintenance therapy was presented by 
the number and percentage of the subjects with clinical response. To investigate the factors affecting 
the effectiveness, the number and percentage of subjects with clinical response were also be classified 
by background factors (e.g., demographic factors, treatment factors such as medical history, dosing 
and administration, concomitant medications, beginning of administration before/after the registration 
date, etc.) and tabulated. If the effectiveness evaluation of above factors was statistically significant, it 
was presented as a separate item. 
Main Statistical Methods 
In final report, safety and effectiveness outcome by background factor was summarized and analyzed. 
The analysis for categorical variables was performed using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and 
continuous variables was performed using Wilcoxon rank sum test or t-test. Also, incidence rate of 
adverse event collected in overall PMS period was analyzed and 95% CI was presented. 
No statistical imputations were planned for missing values.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The study enrolled 152 subjects from 13 study sites during the PMS study period (4 years, 13 
September 2013 through 12 September 2017). Among these 152 subjects, 143 subjects were included 
in the safety analysis population excluding 9 subjects who did not use the drug according to the 
approved indication or dosage. The effectiveness analysis of induction therapy was conducted on 92 
subjects excluding 51 subjects from 143 safety evaluation subjects – 12 subjects did not have any 
parameter value from effectiveness evaluation, 38 subjects did not meet the visit window, and 1 
subject both did not have any parameter value and did not meet the visit window. The effectiveness 
analysis of maintenance therapy was conducted on 74 subjects except 69 subjects from 143 safety 
evaluation subjects – 41 subjects did not have any parameter value from effectiveness evaluation, and 
28 subjects did not meet the visit window. 
Baseline data; patient characteristics 
Of 143 subjects in the safety population, 60.84% (87/143 subjects) were male and 39.16% (56/143 
subjects) were female. None of the subjects were pregnant. The mean age was 14.14 (± 2.43) years 
old ranged from 6.00 to 17.00 years old. 89.51% (128/143 subjects) were between the age of 12 and 
18 years old, and 10.49% (15/143 subjects) were between 24 months and 11 years old. None of the 
subjects were infants less than 24 months and adults over 19 years old. 
The mean duration of paediatric CD symptoms was 24.60 (± 27.60) months. In involved intestinal 
area, colon had been the most commonly reported as 86.01% (123/143 subjects), followed by 84.62% 
(121/143 subjects) with ileum, 41.96% (60/143 subjects) with anal/perianal, 36.36% (52/143 
subjects) with rectum, 24.48% (35/143 subjects) with gastroduodenum, 20.28% (29/143 subjects) 
with jejunum, and 2.10% (3/143 subjects) with other. Those without presence of draining fistula were 
62.94% (90/143 subjects), and those with previous CD related therapy were 98.60% (141/143 
subjects). Before treated with Humira, 78.01% (110/143 subjects) had been treated with 
immunosuppressants, 75.89% (107/143 subjects) with 5-ASA, 72.34% (102/143 subjects) with

antibiotics, 68.09% (96/143 subjects) with steroids, 46.81% (66/143 subjects) with nutritional 
therapy, 30.50% (43/143 subjects) with biologics, and 2.84% (4/143 subjects) with other. 
The subjects with concomitant medications were 95.80% (137/143 subjects) and 458 cases of 
concomitant medications were reported. 51.75% (74/143 subjects, 93 cases) had been treated with 
'Intestinal antiinflammatory agents' which was the most common, 45.45% (65/143 subjects, 73 cases) 
with immunosuppressants, 23.78% (34/143 subjects, 36 cases) with antidiarrheal microorganisms, 
20.28% (29/143 subjects, 38 cases) with other antibacterials, and 18.88% (27/143 subjects, 28 
cases) with antimetabolites. 
The subjects were categorized into 'before enrolment' and 'after enrolment.' 'Before enrolment' group 
is for the subjects who had been administered Humira before enrolment into this study. 'After 
enrolment' group is for the subjects who had been administered Humira on the same date or after they 
signed the informed consent form for this study. Of 143 subjects in the safety population, the subjects 
included in before enrolment' were 30.77% (44/143 subjects), and 'after enrolment' were 69.23% 
(99/143 subjects). The mean of total dose of administration was 1,160.00 (± 943.77) mg and the 
mean length of treatment was 52.81 (± 45.58) weeks. 
Humira® treatment at the last administration was ongoing for 96.50% (138/143 subjects), 
discontinuation for 3.50% (5/143 subjects). The reasons for discontinue of Humira administration were 
'Adverse event' for 60.00% (3/5 subjects), 20.00% (1/5 subjects) 'Lack of drug effect' and 'Others' 
each. 
Safety results 
A total of 47 adverse events in 18.18% (26/143 subjects) were reported from 143 safety evaluation 
subjects. Of these adverse events, 26 adverse events which occurred in 14.69% (21/143 subjects) 
were considered as adverse drug reactions, see table below.

The most frequent adverse event was leukopenia which occurred in 2.80% (4/143 subjects) with 4 
cases.  The most frequently reported adverse drug reaction was leukopenia which occurred in 2.80% 
(4/143 subjects) with 4 cases. Rash was found in 2.10% (3/143 subjects) with 3 cases. 
A total of 13 serious adverse events in 5.59% (8/143 subjects) were reported from 143 safety 
evaluation subjects. Of these adverse events, 5 serious adverse events which occurred in 3.50% 
(5/143 subjects) were considered as serious adverse drug reactions. The most frequent adverse event 
was abdominal pain which occurred in 1.40% (2/143 subjects) with 2 cases. Gastrointestinal necrosis, 
haematochezia, ileus paralytic, intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, small intestinal 
obstruction, appendicitis, peritonitis, pyrexia, candida infection, and pyelonephritis acute were reported 
in 0.70% (1/143 subjects) with 1 case each. The 5 serious adverse drug reactions were ileus paralytic, 
intestinal perforation, appendicitis, candida infection, and pyelonephritis acute which occurred in 
3.50% (5/143 subjects) with 1 case each. 
Of the 47 adverse events, 25 were assessed as mild, 18 as moderate and 4 as severe. The four severe 
events were all gastrointestinal disorders; Haematochezia, Intestinal perforation, Intestinal obstruction 
and Ileus paralytic. 
The distribution of adverse events by action taken were investigated. In 53.19% (25/47 cases) no 
action was taken, in 36.17% (17/47 cases) Humira was transiently discontinued, in 6.38% (3/47 
cases) the action was reported as “other”, and in 4.26% (2/47 cases) Humira was permanently 
discontinued. The two adverse events that led to permanent discontinuation of the drug were reported 
as Intestinal perforation and Skin reaction. 
The distribution of adverse events by outcome were investigated, and 91.49% were resolved, 4.26% 
were resolved with sequelae, and 2.13% were not resolved and other, respectively. There were no

outcome of fatal/death. Adverse events which resolved with sequelae were intestinal perforation and 
acute pyelonephritis. Intestinal perforation has judged as resolved with sequelae, because it left a scar. 
Acute pyelonephritis has judged as resolved with sequelae which lead to kidney damage. The event 
that was reported as not resolved was an event of leukopenia.  
A total of 17 unexpected adverse events (not on the list of local label) in 6.29% (9/143 subjects) were 
reported from 143 safety evaluation subjects. Of these adverse events, 4 unexpected adverse events 
which occurred in 2.80% (4/143 subjects) were considered as unexpected adverse drug reactions. The 
most frequent adverse event was aspartate aminotransferase increased which occurred in 2.10% 
(3/143 subjects) with 3 cases. Intestinal stenosis was found in 1.40% (2/143 subjects) with 2 cases. 
Colonic haematoma, gastrointestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal necrosis, ileus paralytic, intestinal 
obstruction, small intestinal obstruction, appendicitis, helicobacter gastritis, C-reactive protein 
increased, red blood cell sedimentation rate increased, pain, and anastomotic complication were 
reported in 0.70% (1/143 subjects) with 1 case each.  
Of the unexpected events, 16 adverse events were reported as the subjects recovered except 1 
adverse event for appendicitis. And 13 adverse events were reported the causality with Humira as not 
related. All of 17 adverse events were already reported through the Periodic Safety Update Report 
(PSUR) for Adalimumab. Therefore, although these unexpected adverse events are, according to the 
applicant, not listed per se in the product label, it has been reported and the MAH considers them as 
AEs that could be expected to occur among Humira users. 
The relationships between various factors (i.e., demographic characteristics, medical background, and 
treatment with Humira) and the adverse events following Humira were explored. Univariate analysis 
and logistic regression analysis were conducted on demographic, medical, and treatment with Humira 
and according to the application,  it showed statistically significant result according to sex (p-value = 
0.0014 (AEs), 0.0115 [ADRs]), with a higher incidence rate in males than in females. It was stated 
that there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of adverse events/adverse 
drug reactions in other factors. The applicant states that due to the relatively small sample size in this 
study, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Overall, the MAH concluded that safety of Humira observed during the course of this PMS study was 
not remarkably different than the previously documented safety profile of the product, as described in 
the label and periodic safety update reports. The MAH further stated that the safety of Humira will 
continue to be monitored after the submission of this report through spontaneous reporting of adverse 
events and collection of safety information. 
Efficacy results 
The effectiveness analyses were performed using effectiveness population including the subjects who 
administered Humira for induction/maintenance therapy with the record of PCDAI (Paediatric Crohn's 
Disease Activity Index, PCDAI) among the safety population. CDAI (Crohn's Disease Activity Index, 
CDAI) score were collected as well, if possible.  
According to the study protocol, the effectiveness of induction and maintenance therapies were 
evaluated according to main and sub analysis. Main analysis was conducted based on the data 
excluded out of window study visit cases. Sub analysis was conducted based on the data included out 
of window study visit cases. The effectiveness assessment of Humira induction therapy and 
maintenance therapy was presented by the number and percentage of the subjects with clinical 
response. In the Clinical Expert Overview it was explained that when evaluating the clinical response 
rate, the subjects who violated the defined period was included for effectiveness population, as a 
sensitivity analysis.

1. Effectiveness of Humira Induction Therapy (at 4 Weeks) 
The mean PCDAI decrease at baseline visit and following visit was 30.09 (± 10.79) and it showed, 
according to the applicant, statistically significant result (p-value < 0.0001). The mean CDAI decrease 
at baseline visit and following visit was 24.38 (± 15.46) and it was, according to the applicant, not 
statistically significant (n = 4).  
The results of the main analysis on the clinical response rate of induction therapy show, according to 
the study report, that the subjects who had clinical response were 88.04% (81/92 subjects) and the 
subjects without clinical response were 11.96% (11/92 subjects). The proportion of clinical response 
was statistically significant higher than 50% (p-value < 0.0001). It is further stated in the study report 
that the results of the sub analysis on the clinical response rate of induction therapy show that the 
subjects who had clinical response were 87.69% (114/130 subjects) and the subjects without clinical 
response were 12.31% (16/130 subjects). It is explained in the Clinical Expert Overview that in this 
analysis 38 subjects with observations outside of the defined period were included in the analysis set. 
The proportion of clinical response was statistically significant higher than 50% (p-value < 0.0001). 
The relationships between various factors (i.e., demographic characteristics, medical background, and 
treatment with Humira) and effectiveness results following Humira were explored. The result of 
univariate analysis on demographic, medical, and treatment with Humira, all factors were, according to 
the applicant, not statistically significant. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the 
clinical response rate based on the duration of Paediatric CD symptoms and the treatment with Humira 
of the subjects. As the total dose of Humira increased by 1 mg, the odds for the clinical response rate 
in the subject was, according to the applicant, statistically significant at 0.999 (Odds ratio CI: 0.998, 
1.000) (p-value = 0.0444). There was no statistically significant difference in the clinical response rate 
in other factors (duration of paediatric CD, length of treatment. 
2. Effectiveness of Humira Maintenance Therapy (at 6 Months) 
The mean PCDAI decrease at baseline visit and following visit was 32.81 (± 13.55) and it showed, 
according to the applicant, statistically significant result (p-value < 0.0001). The mean CDAI decrease 
at baseline visit and following visit was 62.98 (± 76.78) and it was, according to the applicant, not 
statistically significant (n = 5).  
It is stated in the study report, that results of the main analysis on clinical response rate of 
maintenance therapy show that the subjects who had clinical response were 87.84% (65/74 subjects) 
and the subjects without clinical response were 12.16% (9/74 subjects). It is further stated that the 
proportion of clinical response was statistically significant higher than 50% (p-value < 0.0001). The 
results of the sub analysis on clinical response rate of maintenance therapy show, according to the 
study report, that the subjects who had clinical response were 85.29% (87/102 subjects) and the 
subjects without clinical response were 14.71% (15/102 subjects). It is explained in the Clinical Expert 
Overview that this analysis 28 subjects with observations outside of the defined period, were included 
in the analysis set. The study report states that proportion of clinical response was statistically 
significant higher than 50% (p-value < 0.0001). 
The relationships between various factors (i.e., demographic characteristics, medical background, and 
treatment with Humira) and effectiveness results following Humira were explored. The result of 
univariate analysis on demographic, medical, and treatment with Humira, showed, according to the 
applicant, statistically significant result according to start date of treatment with Humira (p-value = 
0.0238). Subjects who categorized to 'Before enrolment participation,' the subjects who showed 
response were 75.86% (22/29 subjects) and 24.14% (7/29 subjects) showed non-response. Subjects 
who categorized to 'After enrolment participation,' the subjects who showed response were 95.56%

(43/45 subjects) and 4.44% (2/45 subjects) showed non-response. According to the applicant, there 
was no statistically significant difference in the clinical response rate in other factors. 
Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the clinical response rate based on the 
duration of Paediatric CD symptoms and the treatment with Humira of the subjects. The applicant 
states that as the duration of paediatric CD increased by 1 month, the odds for the clinical response 
rate in the subject was statistically significant lower at 0.976 (Odds ratio CI: 0.958, 0.995) (p-value = 
0.0143). The applicant further states that as the total dose of Humira increased by 1 mg, the odds for 
the clinical response rate in the subject was statistically significant at 0.999 (Odds ratio CI: 0.999, 
1.000) (p-value = 0.0087). As the length of treatment increased by 1 week, the odds for the clinical 
response rate in the subject was statistically significant at 0.988 (Odds ratio CI: 0.978, 0.997) (p-value 
= 0.0120). 
The MAH concluded that in terms of effectiveness, the results demonstrate Humira to be effective for 
paediatric CD. Only data for clinical response are given, no data on clinical remission are provided.  
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical data from study P15-619 
Study P15-619 was a non-interventional, observational study of Humira in the treatment of paediatric 
CD that included Korean patients who were prescribed Humira in accordance with the approved SmPC. 
The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in Korean paediatric 
patients with moderate to severe CD.  The study aimed to recruit 600 subjects for 4 years. However, 
the number of subjects to be enrolled was adjusted due to low incidence and prevalence of Paediatric 
CD, the fact that only a very limited number of patients with the disease receive the drug and 
difficulties in getting patients' consents. It was stated that patients were observed for 6 months 
following first dose of Humira. 
In summary, a total of 47 adverse events in 18.18% (26/143 subjects) and 13 serious adverse events 
in 5.59% (8/143 subjects) were reported. From the tabulated data there appeared to be 6 cases of 
infections: appendicitis, helicobacter gastritis, peritonitis, candida infection, pyelonephritis and 
folliculitis. Injection site erythema was reported in 1 patient. Serious adverse events included 
abdominal pain, gastrointestinal necrosis, haematochezia, ileus paralytic, intestinal obstruction, 
intestinal perforation, small intestinal obstruction, appendicitis, peritonitis, pyrexia, candida infection, 
and pyelonephritis acute. Regarding actions taken in relation to the adverse events, in 53.19% (25/47 
cases) no action was taken, in 36.17% (17/47 cases) Humira was transiently discontinued, in 6.38% 
(3/47 cases) the action was reported as “other”, and in 4.26% (2/47 cases) Humira was permanently 
discontinued. The two adverse events that led to permanent discontinuation of the drug were reported 
as Intestinal perforation and Skin reaction. Regarding outcome of the adverse event, 91.49% was 
reported as resolved. 
A total of 17 unexpected adverse events (not on the list of local label) in 6.29% (9/143 subjects) were 
reported from 143 safety evaluation subjects. These events included: aspartate aminotransferase 
increased which occurred in 2.10% (3/143 subjects) with 3 cases and Intestinal stenosis which was 
found in 1.40% (2/143 subjects) with 2 cases. Colonic haematoma, gastrointestinal inflammation, 
gastrointestinal necrosis, ileus paralytic, intestinal obstruction, small intestinal obstruction, 
appendicitis, helicobacter gastritis, C-reactive protein increased, red blood cell sedimentation rate 
increased, pain, and anastomotic complication were reported in 0.70% (1/143 subjects) with 1 case 
each. All of 17 adverse events were already reported through the Periodic Safety Update Report 
(PSUR) for Adalimumab. Therefore, although these unexpected adverse events are not listed per se in 
the local product label, it has been reported and the MAH considers them as AEs that could be 
expected to occur among Humira users.

The majority of the studied subjects were reported to have a clinical response both at 4 weeks and at 6 
months. Due to the study design, the efficacy data from this study is of limited interest. Further, no 
data on clinical remission, which is the preferred primary endpoint in EU, was given. 
Overall, due to the study design, the Rapporteur considers that the data on efficacy generated by the 
study is of limited interest, although there does not seem to be anything in this data that remarkably 
deviates from previous knowledge on the efficacy of Humira for the paediatric CD indication. Also the 
data generated by the attempts to investigate the relationship between various patient characteristics 
and study outcome are of limited interest due to the small study size. Regarding the overall safety 
data, the AEs observed in the study appear to be either events that are expected to occur in a 
paediatric CD population (and which are to a large extent caused by the underlying disease) or events 
that are expected to occur in children treated with Humira (with infections being the most obvious 
example). It should be noted that elevated liver enzymes is listed as a very common adverse reaction 
in section 4.8 of the EU SmPC. Thus, it is preliminary agreed with the applicant that no new safety 
issues that would warrant changes to the PI or RMP were observed, although the probability of 
detecting uncommon SAEs are clearly impacted by the drop in study size compared to what was 
originally planned. Moreover, the interpretation of safety data is hampered by the fact that sufficient 
data on administered dose and drug exposure was not submitted by the applicant.  Finally, it is not 
clear whether the Korean label for Humira authorization is consistent with the EU SmPC regarding the 
indication (section 4.1 of the SmPC).  For a final assessment of the data, the applicant is therefore 
requested to: 
• 
Present the dose of Humira that the children in the study received and clarify whether this dose 
is consistent with the posology in the approved EU SmPC. It should also be clarified whether 
the Korean label is consistent with the EU SmPC regarding the indication  
•  Clearly summarize and present the amount of drug exposure generated by the study 
• 
Present the P15-619 study incidence rate of adverse events, serious adverse events, 
infections, serious infections and injection site reaction as AEs/100 patient years. Moreover, 
the applicant should compare these incidence rates to the incidence rates in the development 
programme for paediatric CD and discuss any important differences observed.  
2.  Applicant’s response to Rapporteur’s List of Questions and 
the Rapporteur’s assessment of the responses 
Summary of the MAH response 
•  All 143 analyzable pediatric subjects in Study P15-619 were dosed per clinical practice 
following the approved Korean label. The indication and dose provided in the approved Korean 
label for pediatric subjects with CD is consistent with the approved EU SmPC. Three (2.10%) 
subjects switched from every other week to weekly dosing, and another 3 (2.10%) subjects 
received weekly dosing directly after induction therapy. 
•  Across the pediatric population in Study P15-619 (N = 143), a total of 47 adverse events (AEs) 
and 13 serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed, which corresponded to an overall 
observed rate of 32.5 events (E)/100 patient-treatment years (PTYs) and 9.0 E/100 PTYs, 
respectively. In addition, an overall observed rate of 2.8 E/100 PTYs, 2.1 E/100 PTYs, and 0.7 
E/100 PTYs was observed for the total number of infections, serious infections, and injection 
site reactions, respectively.

The exposure-adjusted AE rate in Study P15-619 is lower than the rate observed in the global 
adalimumab pediatric CD clinical program, please refer to table below. However, it is similar to 
the rate observed in Study P11-292, which is a multinational long-term non-interventional 
registry to assess the safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with 
moderately to severely active CD. The exposure adjusted SAE, infection, and serious infection 
rates are lower in Study P15-619 than the rates observed in the global adalimumab pediatric 
CD clinical program and also lower than in Study P11-292. The exposure-adjusted injection site 
reaction rate is lower compared to the rate observed in the global adalimumab pediatric CD 
clinical program.

Global Adalimumab Pediatric CD Program 
The differences in the rates between the global clinical program and the post-marketing 
registry/post-marketing observational study (PMOS) are explained by the methodological 
differences of AE collection between the studies. In the global adalimumab pediatric CD clinical 
program (Studies M06-806 and M06-807), all AEs and SAEs were solicited or spontaneously 
reported and collected from the time of first study drug administration until 70 days following 
discontinuation of study drug. In addition, SAEs were collected from the time the subject or 
parent/legal guardian had signed the informed consent. In the PMOS (Study P15-619), non-
serious AEs and SAEs were collected from the time the subjects or subjects' legal 
representatives had signed the informed consent to up to 70 days following the last 
administration of study drug. In the post-marketing authorization safety study (PASS registry 
P11-292), all SAEs and AEs of special interest are collected at each doctor's visit during the 
first 5 years. Starting at Year 6, SAEs and AEs of special interest related to infections and 
malignancies are collected through Year 10. Other than at regular doctor's visits, SAEs and AEs

of special interest, as appropriate, are collected from spontaneous reports throughout the 
registry. 
Rapporteurs’ assessment of the response and conclusion 
The applicant clarified that subjects in Study P15-619 were dosed per clinical practice following the 
approved Korean label and that the indication and dose provided in the approved Korean label for 
pediatric subjects with CD is consistent with the approved EU SmPC. 
The applicant presented the overall exposure from Study P15-619 as well as the incidence rate of 
adverse events, serious adverse events, infections, serious infections and injection site reaction as 
AEs/100 patient years. Moreover, the applicant compared these incidence rates to the incidence rates 
in the development programme for paediatric CD. It was found that the exposure-adjusted AE, SAE, 
infection, serious infection and injection reaction rate in Study P15-619 is lower than the rate observed 
in the global adalimumab pediatric CD clinical program. The applicant put forward that differences in 
the rates between the global clinical program and the post-marketing registry/post-marketing 
observational study (PMOS) are explained by the methodological differences of AE collection between 
the studies. 
In summary, the applicant has responded satisfactory to the Rapporteur’s question and no further 
action is required. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Due to the study design, the Rapporteur considers that the data on efficacy generated by the study is 
of limited interest. Regarding the overall safety data, the AEs observed in the study appear to be either 
events that are expected to occur in a paediatric CD population (and which are to a large extent 
caused by the underlying disease) or events that are expected to occur in children treated with Humira 
(with infections being the most obvious example). The exposure-adjusted AE, SAE, infection, serious 
infection and injection reaction rate in Study P15-619 was lower than the rate observed in the global 
adalimumab pediatric CD clinical program. It thus is agreed with the applicant that no new safety 
issues that would warrant changes to the PI or RMP were observed, although the probability of 
detecting uncommon SAEs is clearly impacted by the drop in study size compared to what was 
originally planned.  
Recommendation 
The Rapporteur considers the requirements as:  
  Fulfilled 
No further regulatory action required.

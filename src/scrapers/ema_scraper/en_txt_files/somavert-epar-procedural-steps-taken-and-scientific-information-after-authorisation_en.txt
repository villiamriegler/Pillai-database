1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Variation to update the Risk Management Plan 
following assessment of the final results of 
ACROSTUDY, a multicenter, Post Authorisation 
Safety Study (PASS) of Somavert therapy in patients 
with acromegaly (procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/000409/II/0089), grouped with variation 
to update of section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding 
growth hormone secreting tumours, consequential to 
the removal of pituitary tumour growth as a potential 
risk from the RMP.  
The RMP version 2.0 has been submitted and the 
MAH took the opportunity to update it as per the 
(PASS) of Somavert therapy in patients with acromegaly, 
the relationship between pegvisomant and risk of tumour 
growth was analysed and it was established that the 
mention regarding growth hormone secreting tumours and 
the statements regarding monitoring of the tumour growth, 
expansion and reduction of the GH-secreting pituitary 
tumours from Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions 
for use should not be removed, but reworded so as to align 
to the wording on growth hormone secreting tumours of 
the SmPC for other approved acromegaly therapies.

update the safety information regarding the ADR 
‘systemic hypersensitivity reactions’. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to amend the listed terms 
in sections 4.8 and 4.9 to MedDRA terms, to reorder 
the events into MedDRA system organ class 
sequence, to change the frequencies of two listed 
ADRs and to implement changes to sections 4.8 and

Finally, the contact details of the local representative 
in Spain have been updated in the Package Leaflet 
and a statement has been added that the vial 
adapter (Mixject) is not marketed in all EU member 
states. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, laryngospasm, 
angioedema, generalized skin reactions (rash, erythema, 
pruritus, urticaria) have been reported in post marketing 
use.  Some patients required hospitalization. Upon re-
administration, symptoms did not re-occur in all patients. 
In support of this variation application, the MAH provided a 
cumulative review of all “possible hypersensitivity-related 
events” reported in its database.  Through 31 May 2010, a 
total of 79 cases were identified (8.3% of the total number 
of pegvisomant reported cases) that encoded to at least 
one PT included in the search criteria. Out of these 79 
cases, 42 cases reported events that did not appear to be 
related to a systemic hypersensitivity reaction to 
pegvisomant therapy. Among the 37 remaining cases (1 
duplicate), 13 were assessed as serious without any fatal 
outcome.  
The nature of the reported serious AEs, mostly with short 
latency, the mostly favourable outcome after pegvisomant 
discontinuation and the absence of other more compatible 
aetiologies - even if six of the 36 cases reported a 
potentially relevant medical history associated with a high 
risk of a systemic hypersensitivity-related event - are all in 
favour of the responsibility of pegvisomant therapy in these 
hypersensitivity-related events. Some physio-pathological 
explanations have been proposed by the MAH, but no 
formal conclusion can be drawn regarding the aetiological 
Page 16/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mechanism.  
Taking into account the time course of the reporting rate of 
systemic hypersensitivity-related events compared to the 
time of discontinuation of latex-containing stoppers, this 
does not seem to imply that these are latex related allergic 
reactions.  
The MAH had previously raised the hypothesis that 
improper storage of the vials or of the reconstituted 
solution may lead to chemical degradation and/or soluble 
aggregates formation and thus to potential occurrence of 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions. However, as stated by 
the MAH, the Somavert formulation has been shown to 
protect the active molecule against stresses, e.g. 
shaking/agitation, exposure to high temperatures, 
exposure to freezing temperatures, and undue exposure to 
light, both in the lyophilized state and also in the liquid 
state. The available stability data over multiple lots 
manufactured over many years supports the conclusion 
that the product quality, as measured by chemical 
degradation as well as aggregate levels, is maintained over 
the shelf-life of the product. The risk to the lyophilized 
product quality through the formation of chemical and 
physical (i.e. aggregation) degradation products is minimal. 
Furthermore, appropriate instructions for storage and 
reconstitution that cover the risk of mishandling are already 
provided in the SmPC and in the Package Leaflet. 
No data on antibodies (to GH or to pegvisomant) titers in 
patients having experienced systemic hypersensitivity 
events are currently available.

Somavert. Based on this review, the MAH was requested to 
consider appropriate changes under the section 4.8 of the 
SPC, in particular with respect to "hypersensitivity, 
lipodystrophy/lipohypertrophy".The MAH therefore 
submitted a proposed wording for the section 4.2, 4.8 of 
the SPC and relevant sections of the PL with respect to 
injection site reaction adverse events. The following 
information was therefore included in the SPC: 
" 
Section 4.2 "Posology and Mehod of 
Administration": 
       The site of injection should be rotated daily to help 
prevent lipohypertrophy. 
" 
Section 4.8 "Undesirable Effects": 
"     General disorders and administration site conditions": 
Common:   influenza-like illness, fatigue, injection site 
bruising or bleeding, injection site reaction (including 
injection site hypersensitivity), injection site hypertrophy 
(e.g. lipohypertrophy)*. 
The MAH took the opportunity to introduce one combined 
PL for all presentations and to update the contact number 
of the Irish local representative in the section 6 of the PL. 
Some minor changes were also introduced in the set of

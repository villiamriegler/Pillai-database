2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder which affects the ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles producing excessive 
daytime sleepiness (EDS), typically associated with cataplexy and other Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep 
conditions such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations. The presence of EDS is a 
defining characteristic of narcolepsy and a major diagnostic criterion. The degree of ES is severe in most patients 
(Khatami et al, 2016). Cataplexy is the second most common symptom of narcolepsy and the most specific one. 
In fact, narcolepsy can be subclassified depending on the presence (type I) or absence (type II) of this 
symptom. Cataplexy is defined as a sudden loss of voluntary muscle tone with preserved consciousness 
triggered by emotion. Its frequency is extremely variable from one or less per year to several per day. Other 
symptoms, referred to as auxiliary symptoms, are less specific and not essential for diagnosis. They include 
hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations, visual perceptual experiences occurring at sleep onset or 
awakening, sleep paralysis and others (Billiard et al. 2006). 
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a serious disorder characterized by sleep fragmentation caused by repeated 
arousals secondary to partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. Persistent EDS is a major 
presenting complaint in many patients, and most patients with OSA awaken in the morning feeling tired and 
unrefreshed regardless of the duration of their time in bed (American Academy of Sleep Medicine [AASM] 2014). 
As with narcolepsy, the persistent sleepiness in patients with OSA occurs at inappropriate times, for instance 
while actively conversing, eating, working, and driving (AASM 2014). This pathological sleepiness often 
continues despite primary treatment of the airway obstruction with positive airway pressure or other therapies 
(Gay et al. 2006; Fietze et al. 2011; and Randerath et al. 2011). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Narcolepsy is a rare, underdiagnosed and lifelong disease for which no cure has been identified. In adults, 
narcolepsy affects an estimated 0.02% to 0.067% of the population worldwide and approximately 4.7 per 
10,000 (0.047%) in the general population of 5 European countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain) 
(Ohayon et al 2002; Ohayon 2007; Majid and Hirshkowitz 2010).  
Prevalence estimates of OSA worldwide range from 9% to 38% (Senaratna et al. 2017). Prevalence estimates 
of ES associated with OSA range from 2% to 7% (Garvey et al. 2015). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Features of narcolepsy include dysregulation of arousal state boundaries as well as autonomic and metabolic 
disturbances.  Disruption  of  neurotransmission  through  the  hypocretin  /  orexin  (HCRT)  system,  usually  by 
degeneration of the HCRT-producing neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, results in narcolepsy. The cause of 
HCRT neurodegeneration is unknown but thought to be related to autoimmune processes (Black et al. 2017). 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 10/128 
  
  
 
 
 
In OSA, abnormalities in the anatomy of the pharynx, the physiology of the upper airway muscle dilator, and the 
stability of the ventilator control are important causes of repetitive pharyngeal collapse during sleep (Malhotra 
et al. 2002). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Both  narcolepsy  and  OSA  diagnosis  was  established  according  to  the  International  Classification  of  Sleep 
Disorders 3rd ed. (ICSD-3) to be eligible for participation in the solriamfetol clinical trial programme. 
Diagnostic  criteria  for  narcolepsy  include  the  presence  of  EDS.  According  to  ICSD-3,  narcolepsy  type  I 
additionally requires either the presence of definitive cataplexy with positive result in the Mean Sleep Latency 
Time (MSLT) or low hypocretin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Narcolepsy type II requires the 
absence of cataplexy, a positive result in MSLT and normal or unperformed CSF hypocretin levels.  
Obstructive sleep apnoea can be diagnosed on the basis of characteristic history (snoring, daytime sleepiness) 
and physical examination (increased neck circumference), but overnight polysomnography is needed to confirm 
presence of the predominantly obstructive respiratory events (Malhotra et al. 2002). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Narcolepsy has no cure, but drug therapies and lifestyle changes can often help improve symptoms and quality 
of life. Three drugs are authorized in the EU for the “treatment of narcolepsy” in adult patients: sodium oxybate 
(Xyrem®) for narcolepsy type I, pitolisant (Wakix®) for narcolepsy types I and II and modafinil (Provigil®) 
considered the first line pharmacological treatment of EDS adult patients with narcolepsy types I or II.  
Currently there are no available pharmacological therapies for treating EDS in patients with OSA in the EU. 
Traditional stimulants, such as amphetamines, prescribed off-label for their wake promoting effects, are limited 
by unwanted side effects like tachyphylaxis and carry substantial abuse liability. In OSA, positive airway 
pressure (PAP) applied through a nasal, oral, or oronasal interface during sleep is considered to be the reference 
standard treatment by the European Respiratory Society (Fietze et al, 2011; Randerath et al, 2011) with the aim 
to stabilize the upper airway. When PAP is not accepted by the patient or when it is not tolerable or effective, 
alternative therapies used for the primary treatment of OSA may include behavioural therapy, or surgical 
intervention (Epstein et al, 2009; Randerath et al, 2011). 
About the product 
Solriamfetol is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI; Baladi et al, 2018). In vitro results 
indicate  that  solriamfetol  has  dual  reuptake  inhibition  activity  at  dopamine  (DA)  and  norepinephrine  (NE) 
transporters and that this activity is associated in vivo with an increase in extracellular concentration of DA in the 
striatum and of NE in the prefrontal cortex as measured by microdialysis in rats (Baladi et al. 2018). The role of 
DA transporters in sleep regulation was described in the literature (Wisor et al. 2001) and is supported by the 
specific dopaminergic wake-promoting action of amphetamines and modafinil. 
The  clinical  development  of  solriamfetol  follows  a  symptom-oriented  approach,  intended  to  improve 
wakefulness and reduce EDS. Sunosi film-coated tablets are proposed to improve wakefulness and reduce EDS 
in adult patients with narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) (75-150 mg) or obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019

(37.5 – 150 mg). During clinical trials solriamfetol was used in OSA patients with previous or current use of 
cPAP. As a wake-promoting agent solriamfetol is not suitable to treat underlying airway obstruction in OSA. 
Sunosi is not designed as a substitute, but an addition of primary CPAP therapy. 
Therefore, solriamfetol could potentially add to the array of available treatment options in narcoleptic patients 
(oxybate,  pitolisant,  modafinil)  and  could  constitute  the  first  medication  approved  to  reduce  EDS  in  OSA 
patients. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 75, 150 or 300 mg of solriamfetol. The 
product contains the hydrochloride salt. 
Other ingredients are: hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, poly(vinyl alcohol) macrogol, talc, 
titanium dioxide (E 171), iron oxide yellow (E 172). 
The product is available in PVC/PCTFE/aluminium blisters and high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with 
polypropylene (PP) child-resistant caps with integrated silica gel desiccant as described in section 6.5 of the

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of solriamfetol hydrochloride is (R)-2-amino-3-phenylpropylcarbamate hydrochloride 
corresponding to the molecular formula C10H14N2O2.HCl. It has a relative molecular mass of 230.69 g/mol and 
the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of solriamfetol hydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 
ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) and x-ray 
powder diffraction (XRPD).  
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 12/128 
  
  
 
 
 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline solid, not hygroscopic below 75% relative humidity (RH) 
but slightly hygroscopic above 75% RH, and freely soluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range. 
Due to the high solubility, particle size is not critical and is not controlled in the specification. 
Solriamfetol exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of a single chiral centre.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Solriamfetol hydrochloride is synthesized in two synthetic steps and salt formations using a well-defined starting 
material with acceptable specifications.  
During the procedure, the starting material was re-defined to ensure that enough of the process is defined in the 
dossier. Prior to this, only one chemical transformation step was included in the proposed manufacturing 
process. As a result, an additional manufacturer, responsible for the extra step, was added to the dossier. All 
requirements related to these changes including analytical method validation and process validation were 
successfully addressed during the procedure. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation of the active 
substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced to improve the process have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is doubly packaged in tightly-closed polyethylene bags which comply with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The bags are subsequently stored within fibre drums. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identity (IR, HPLC), identity of chloride 
(Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), chiral purity (chiral HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from development and commercial scale batches were provided. The results were within the 
specifications were met at each phase or development and commercial scale production and the batch data were 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from seven batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended 
commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and from 3 batches 
stored for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were

provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, related substances, chiral purity, water 
content and microbial enumeration. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. No significant trends were observed for the measured attributes. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No degradation was 
observed, so solriamfetol is not considered photosensitive.  Data on stress conditions were also provided.   
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate-release film-coated tablets in three strengths: 75 mg, 150 mg 
and 300 mg. The compositions of the tablet cores are proportionate in terms of excipients and the tablets are 
distinguished by size and colour (different shades of yellow), with different film-coating compositions being used 
for each strength. In addition, the tablets are debossed on one side with 75, 150 or 300 respectively. 
Initial clinical studies were conducted using a simple “drug in capsule” formulation.  
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a pharmaceutical form for commercialisation; a stable, 
immediate release solid dosage form with visual differentiation of different dosage strengths with equivalent 
stability and dissolution properties.  
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was established from which the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were 
determined and justified.  
The active substance, solriamfetol hydrochloride, is a chemically stable compound, highly soluble in water and 
highly permeable. These factors were informative to the designing of the final pharmaceutical form.   
A granulation approach was adopted during manufacturing development to facilitate subsequent blending and 
compression. Further studies were performed to optimise the relative quantities of excipients. Opadry was 
selected as a cosmetic coat.  
Compatibility with the various excipients was demonstrated during high humidity and high temperature studies 
on binary compressed mixtures. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The 
list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
A discriminatory dissolution test has been validated and has been used to support comparability of the 
development and commercial presentations. 
Testing in line with Ph. Eur. 0478 on sub-division of tablets was conducted. The tablets are shown to split 
consistently in half.  
The primary packaging is PVC/PCTFE/Aluminium blisters or HDPE bottles with PP child-resistant caps and 
integrated silica gel desiccant. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
Assessment report

container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: wet granulation and drying; blending and compression; 
film-coating; packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Critical steps of the process have been identified and appropriate process controls are in place.   
An acceptable process validation protocol has been submitted with the dossier. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), content uniformity 
(Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.).  The analytical 
methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Any degradation products or process related impurities are adequately controlled. Elemental impurities in the 
finished product has been assessed in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities.  
Batch analysis results are provided for three 75 mg batches, one 150 mg batch, and three 300 mg batches 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
The applicant used a bracketing approach in stability studies to cover the three strengths in line with ICH Q1D. 
Primary stability studies were conducted on 3 batches of unscored 75 mg tablets, 1 batch of scored 150 mg 
tablets,  and  3  batches  of  scored  tablets.  Following  a  change  in  proposed  posology  and  a  change  of 
manufacturing site, additional studies were started on 1 batch each of scored 75 mg tablets, unscored 75 mg 
tablets,  unscored  150  mg  tablets  and  unscored  300  mg,  all  from  the  commercial  manufacturing  site.  The 
bracketing  approach  is  considered  acceptable,  and  the  scored  tablets  and  unscored  tablets  are  considered 
representative of each other. Samples were stored in both proposed packaging formats – blisters and HDPE 
bottles. 
Stability  data  was  generated  on  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  24  months  under  long  term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines. Samples were tested for the stability indicating attributes listed in  ”Product Specification”. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating (see below). No significant trends were observed for any 
of the measured parameters, other than an increase in water content under accelerated conditions in the HDPE 
bottle. No increase in water was observed under long term conditions. As a precautionary measure, instructions 
will be included in the SmPC (section 6.4) to keep the bottle tightly closed. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results indicate that the product is not photosensitive.  
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019

Additional forced degradation studies were conducted under stressed conditions to demonstrate the stability 
indicating nature of the analytical methods. In-use stability studies were conducted on multiple batches of 75 
and 150 mg tablets, both intact and split in half.  No significant changes were observed for any of the measured 
parameters. The oldest batch used in these studies was 11 months old. According to the Note for guidance on 
in-use stability testing of human medicinal products (CPMP/QWP/2934/99), at least one batch out of a minimum 
of  two  batches  should  be  chosen  towards  the  end  of  its  shelf-life.  Therefore,  the  applicant  has  made  a 
commitment to conduct an in-use stability study on a batch of 75 mg tablets following completion of the long 
term stability studies (planned for 48 months). 
Bulk stability studies were conducted on finished product intermediates (granulate, tablet cores, and unpacked 
film-coated tablets). All intermediates were sufficiently stable over the time periods studied and the bulk storage 
times have been assigned  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without special storage conditions for the 
blister packs, or kept tightly closed in the HDPE bottles in order to protect from moisture as stated in the SmPC 
(section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
To conduct an in-use stability study on a batch of 75 mg tablets following completion of the long term 
stability studies (planned for 48 months). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects

In vitro studies 
Studies to characterize effects on uptake and release of monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, 
serotonin) 
Cells transfected with cDNA of human monoamine transporters 
Binding studies: In an in vitro study with HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA for human DAT, NET and SERT, 
solriamfetol bound to human DAT and human NET, however,  with a potency (Ki-values 14,200 nM and 3,700 
nM, respectively) clearly lower than cocaine (Ki-values 236 and 505 nM, respectively). Whereas cocaine bound 
also to the SERT with high potency (Ki 361 nM), affinity of solriamfetol for the SERT was very low (Ki 81,500 nM). 
In a study with CHO cells transfected with cDNA for the human monoamine transporters, binding of solriamfetol 
(but  not  of  the  solriamfetol  metabolite  N-acetyl  solriamfetol)  to  the  hDAT  could  be  confirmed,  however, 
solriamfetol failed to show binding to the human hNET and hSERT at a concentration of 10 µM.  Solriamfetol also 
failed to show binding to the hNET in a receptor screening assay when applied at a concentration of 1 µM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 18/128 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Inhibition  of  monoamine  reuptake:  Solriamfetol  inhibited  uptake  of  dopamine  and  noradrenalin  by  the 
transfected HEK293 cells with IC50-values of 2,900 nM and 4,400 nM, respectively (corresponding values for 
cocaine were 385 nM and 194 nM). Whereas cocaine also inhibited serotonin uptake with high potency (IC50 355 
nM), solriamfetol was practically ineffective (IC50 > 100µM) (JNJ-Y1-DA-5005-03-B). 
Stimulation  of  monoamine  release:  Solriamfetol  had  no  effect  on  the  release  of  preloaded  3H-dopamine, 
3H-noradrenaline and  3H-5-HT  from the HEK293 cells, whereas methamphetamine stimulated the release of 
radiolabelled  dopamine  (EC50  721  nM)  and  noradrenaline  (EC50  103  nM)  and,  less  potent,  serotonin  (EC50 
22,800 nM) (JNJ-Y1-DA-5005-03-A). 
Rat (brain tissue and recombinant transporters) 
Binding studies 
-  In rat brain tissue, solriamfetol (but not its stereoisomer) bound to the DAT (Ki about 10,000 nM), but not to 
the SERT (UNC 5318). 
-  Binding studies conducted in rat striatal synaptosomes confirmed that solriamfetol inhibited binding to the 
rDAT (IC50 2,600 nM), however, with a lower binding affinity than the known monoamine reuptake inhibitors 
cocaine and mazindol (JNJ-8470).  
-  In a screening assay, solriamfetol inhibited binding to the rDAT with a Ki-value of 5,158 nM, however, failed 
to show binding to the rNET (and to the hSERT) in concentrations up to 10 µM (JNJ 8470). 
-  Solriamfetol  also  failed  to  show  binding  to  the  rNET  and  rSERT  in  another  assay  when  tested  at 
concentrations up to 10 µM. 
-  The weak interaction of the DAT inhibitor mazindol with 3H-solriamfetol binding to rat striatal synaptosomes 
argues for a weak interaction of solriamfetol with the rat DAT and suggests other non-specific cellular binding 
sites  for  solriamfetol.  A  high-degree  of  non-specific  binding  of  radiolabelled  solriamfetol  to  rat  striatal 
membranes is also suggested by the fact that radiolabelled solriamfetol could only slightly displaced by an 
excess concentration of “cold” solriamfetol (JNJ-8470). 
Inhibition of monoamine reuptake 
In  rat  brain  synaptosomes,  solriamfetol  inhibited  dopamin  reuptake  (striatal)  and  noradrenalin  reuptake 
(hypothalamic) with IC50-values of 21,000 nM and 6,500 nM, respectively. Compared with the reference ligands 
GBR-12909, bupropion, and desipramine, solriamfetol displayed low potency. For example, the Ki of solriamfetol 
for inhibition of dopamine uptake was 22-fold higher than the Ki of bupropion for this parameter (UNC 5318). 
Stimulation of monoamine release 
In a study with rat brain synaptosomes, the highest concentration of solriamfetol tested (30 μM) resulted in 
dopamine  and  5-HT  release  (approximately  70%  and  30%  of  that  of  the  respective  high  potency  reference 
compounds amphetamine and MMAI). Release of norepinephrine was not stimulated (UNC 5318). 
Guinea pig brain tissue 
Binding  studies:  Solriamfetol  inhibited  radioligand  binding  to  the  guinea  pig  DAT  with  a  Ki  of  3,410  nM 
(JNJ-96-2389. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019

In vitro studies to detect potential interactions of solriamfetol with other pharmacological targets 
Solriamfetol completely displaced 3H-cocaine from its binding sites on rat striatal synaptosomes (IC50 4,100 nM) 
(JNJ-8470). 
In HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA for the human vesicular monoamine transporter, solriamfetol showed 
very low binding affinitiy (Ki > 250,000 nM), however, inhibited 3H-serotonin uptake with an IC50 of 6,300 nM 
(JNJ-9072). Solriamfetol, in concentrations up to 10 µM, did also not show binding affinity for the rat vesicular 
monoamine transporter (Eurofins 66491). 
Solriamfetol,  in  concentrations  up  to  10  µM,  was  devoid  of  binding  affinity  for  dopamine  (UNC  5318)  and   
histamine  receptors  (H1,  H2,  and  H3)  in  rat  brain  tissue  (NovaScreen  870  and  871),  in  SK-N-MC  cells 
transfected  with  cDNA  for  human  histamine  receptors  (DD06604)  and  in  PFSK-cells  expressing  the  orexin 
receptor 2 (JNJ 6605). 
In  a  screening  assay  with  transfected  human  receptors,  binding  affinity  of  solriamfetol  to  adrenergic  alpha 
2-receptors type A (Ki 10,470 nM) and B (Ki 2,684 nM) was observed (JNJ-8470). However, in vitro functional 
assays showed that solriamfetol in concentrations up to 100 µM has no agonist or antagonist activity in cells 
expressing human recombinant alpha 2A, 2B or 2C receptors. 
In additional screening assays (CEREP 870189, JNJ-8470) investigating a wide variety of receptors, transporters 
and enzymes no relevant binding of solriamfetol was observed. However, the tested solriamfetol concentrations 
of 1 µM, respectively 10 µM, appear to be too low to allow for a definite conclusion whether the evaluated targets 
are potential candidates for interaction with solriamfetol (JNJ-8470). 
In vivo studies 
Studies  to  characterize  effects  on  uptake  and  release  of  monoamines  (dopamine,  noradrenaline, 
serotonin) 
Binding studies 
Binding studies conducted in rats following a single SC dose of 40 mg/kg solriamfetol did not demonstrate any 
significant occupancy at several receptors (dopamine D2, adrenergic alpha 2A and 2B) and transporters (DAT, 
NET, and SERT) as measured by autoradiography (JNJ-0893). 
Effects on brain levels of monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin) 
Striatal  dopamine  and  prefrontal  cortical  norepinephrine  extracellular  levels  in  freely  moving  conscious  rats 
were measured via in vivo brain microdialysis. At a SC dose of 30 mg/kg (but not 10 mg/kg), if normalized to a 
starting (t=0 min) level of 100% per treatment group, striatal dopamine and prefrontal noradrenaline tissue 
levels appeared to be increased by solriamfetol in a time-dependent manner during an evaluation period of 550 
min. However, if calculated on basis of the absolute tissue levels measured, a significant increase could not be 
demonstrated  (which  may,  at  least  in  part,  be  due  to  the  large  individual  differences  in  monoamine  tissue 
levels). No consistent effects of solriamfetol (at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg) on serotonin levels were detected in 
either region (JNJ-8880). 
In a second in vivo microdialysis study in rats, no significant increases were observed in levels of dopamine, 
dopamine metabolites (DOPAC, HVA) or the serotonin metabolite 5-H1AA after IP administration of 15 and 30 
mg/kg solriamfetol (UNC 5318).

Studies on behavioural effects of solriamfetol 
General behavioural effects in healthy animals 
In a general observation test, IP solriamfetol induced sniffing (ED50 16 mg/kg), mydriasis (ED50 21 mg/kg), 
excitation (ED50 25 mg/kg), rearing (ED50 25 mg/kg), exophthalmos (ED50 32 mg/kg), and hyperthermia (ED50 
37 mg/kg) in rats, thereby mimicking amphetamine in profile (JNJ-1783). 
However,  in  contrast  to  the  effects  of  amphetamine,  solriamfetol  did  not  reverse  hypomotility  and  miosis 
induced by Ro-4-1284 (a vesicular monoamine transport [VMAT-2] inhibitor that depletes secretory vesicles), 
did  not  induce  stereotyped  behaviour,  did  not  block  the  tail-pinch  response,  and  did  not  potentiate  the 
behavioral effects of 5-HT in mice and rats (JNJ-1783). 
Solriamfetol does not appear to have relevant in vivo functional activity at the SERT and monoamine oxidase 
type  A  and  B.  In  contrast  to  the  effects  of  the  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor  (SSRI)  fluoxetine, 
solriamfetol (30 and 60 mg/kg PO) decreased the sensitivity of mice to 5-HT-induced head twitches, indicating 
that solriamfetol does not likely function as an SSRI (PCOL 96-3). 
Further evidence that solriamfetol does not exhibit behavioural effects consistent with those of SSRIs as well as 
directly-acting  5-HT  agonists,  is  that  unlike  the  ability  of  these  compounds  to  increase  haloperidol-induced 
catalepsy, solriamfetol (30, 60 and 90 mg/kg IP) decreased the cataleptic effects of haloperidol (Yukong 1833). 
Behavioral effects in DAT knock-out mice 
In wild-type mice, solriamfetol (10, 30, 100 mg/kg SC) had no effect on spontaneous or stereotypic activity 
while amphetamine (2 mg/kg SC) induced robust increases in spontaneous and stereotypic activity. Solriamfetol 
demonstrated  a  dose-dependent  reduction  in  locomotor,  rearing,  and  stereotypy  activities  in  DAT  knockout 
mice, suggesting that, in vivo, the effects of solriamfetol are not solely mediated by DAT (JNJ-3946). 
Wake-promoting profile of solriamfetol 
Effects of Solriamfetol on Sleep in Narcoleptic and Wild-Type Mice 
Effects  of  solriamfetol  (50,  100  and  150  mg/kg  PO)  on  various  sleep  parameters  were  evaluated  in 
hypocretin/ataxin-3  transgenic  mice  (mouse  model  of  narcolepsy)  and  their  littermate  wild-type  mice,  with 
modafinil (50 and 200 mg/kg PO) as a reference compound (SU-001).  
During  the  light  (resting)  period,  solriamfetol  dose-dependently  induced  continuous  wakefulness  in  most 
wild-type and narcoleptic mice for up to 5 hours. During this period, REM and non-REM sleep were completely 
suppressed.  No  abnormal  EEG  patterns  were  detected  after  solriamfetol  administration  and  the  sleep  that 
occurred after the prolonged wakefulness was normal by polygraphic assessments.  
During  the  dark  (active)  period  (when  narcoleptic  mice  spend  more  time  sleeping  than  wild-type  mice), 
solriamfetol  dose-dependently  increased  wakefulness  in  both  wild-type  and  narcoleptic  mice.  The 
wake-promoting effects in wild-type mice were less robust due to the high amount of wakefulness naturally 
present during the dark period. Importantly, the wake amounts observed in narcoleptic mice after 100 and 150 
mg/kg  of  solriamfetol  were  similar  to  those  of  wild-type  mice,  suggesting  that  solriamfetol  normalized  the 
sleep/wake  activity  of  narcoleptic  animals.  Non-REM  and  REM  sleep  were  reduced  in  narcoleptic  mice  by 
solriamfetol to the levels observed in wild-type mice. Suppression of the DREM phase by solriamfetol suggests 
that this compound may have therapeutic effects on catalepsy.

prolonged wakefulness was normal (no rebound hypersomnia). The wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol in 
mice were not consistently accompanied by locomotor and stereotypic effects. 
In this study, modafinil was not as potent for inducing wakefulness, and the magnitude of effects was not as 
robust,  compared  with  solriamfetol.  Moreover,  an  increased  sensitivity  to  modafinil  in  hypocretin-deficient, 
compared with wild-type, mice was observed, suggesting that the availability of hypocretin might change the 
sensitivity to modafinil. 
Wake-Promoting Activities of Solriamfetol in 3 Inbred Strains of Mice 
Solriamfetol was found to be a wake-promoting agent without behavioural side effects that can be characteristic 
of D-amphetamine (i.e. locomotor and stereotypic effects). Wakefulness induced by solriamfetol was followed 
by a compensatory rebound in both the duration and intensity (i.e. EEG delta power) of sleep but no evidence of 
rebound hypersomnolence (i.e. over-compensation for sleep lost). The wake duration induced by solriamfetol 
(150 mg/kg IP) and D-amphetamine (6 mg/kg IP) was similar among genotypes, whereas differences among 
the  3  mouse  strains  were  observed  after  modafinil  (150  mg/kg  IP)  treatment.  Brain  transcriptome  and 
clustering analyses indicated that the various pathways activated pharmacologically to maintain an awake brain 
by solriamfetol differ from those of D-amphetamine and modafinil (Hasan et al. 2009). 
Effects of Solriamfetol on Sleep-Wake Organization in Rats 
Effects of solriamfetol (3, 10, 30 mg/kg IP), cocaine (1, 3, 10 mg/kg IP), amphetamine (1, 3, 10 mg/kg IP), on 
sleep-wake organization in rats were investigated following the acrophase of sleep (i.e. drugs were administered 
at the beginning of the light period when most sleep would be expected to occur in rodents). Sleep polygraphic 
variables were measured for 16 hours following administration of drug (JNJ-1485). 
Minor  changes  in  vigilance  states  were  observed  following  administration  of  solriamfetol  3  and  10  mg/kg. 
However, treatment with solriamfetol at 30 mg/kg strongly increased active wakefulness at the expense of time 
spent in light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep during the first 3 to 4 hours after the administration. A rebound 
effect was seen between 4-10 hours following administration of the compound, as an increase in time spent in 
deep  sleep  occurred  that gradually  decreased  in  the  hours  thereafter.  Moreover,  solriamfetol  affected other 
sleep-wake  parameters:  it  increased  significantly  the  number  of  shifts  from  light  sleep  and  REM  sleep  into 
wakefulness and lengthened the latency of REM sleep onset. 
Cocaine  1  and  3  mg/kg  only  slightly  affected  the  sleepwake  organization.  In  contrast,  cocaine  at  10  mg/kg 
significantly enhanced active wakefulness and reduced slow wave sleep and REM sleep during the first 3 to 4 
hours following injection of the compound. All sleep latencies were increased. 
Amphetamine  dose-dependently  increased  wakefulness  and  reduced  all  sleep  states  during  3  to  8  hours 
following administration. A clear dose-dependent rebound effect was observed for deep sleep. Additionally, the 
latencies of all sleep states were significantly increased. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
In in vitro screening assays (CEREP 870189, JNJ-8470) binding of solriamfetol to a wide variety of receptors, 
transporters  and  enzymes  was  evaluated  (see  above,  no  relevant  binding  of  solriamfetol  was  observed. 
However, the tested solriamfenol concentrations of 1 µM, respectively 10 µM, appear to be too low to allow for 
a definite conclusion whether the evaluated targets are potential candidates for interaction with solriamfetol 
(JNJ-8470).

In  vivo  studies  conducted  to  characterize  potential  secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  related  to  safety 
pharmaology are summarized below 
Safety pharmacology  
In vitro studies 
Non-GLP  in  vitro  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  solriamfetol  effects  on  the 
cardiovascular system. 
Concentrations of solriamfetol up to 10 μM did not block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium 
current, IKr in the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay (JNJ-CPF-924), had no notable effects on 
cardiac contractility in isolated guinea pig atria (JNJ-5899), and had no relevant effects on electrophysiological 
parameters or early after-depolarizations in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers (JNJ-CPF-922). 
In vivo studies 
Solriamfetol has been studied in central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems to assess the 
safety pharmacology profile. 
Central Nervous System  
Alertness, activity, and coordination 
Motor activity: Solriamfetol (30, 60 and 100 mg/kg PO) numerically increased motor activity (statistically non 
significant) in mice (imipramine, used as comparator, significantly reduced motor activity). 
Solriamfetol (30 and 60 mg/kg PO) did not increase motor activity in rats (Yukong PCOL 95-9). 
In a GLP study in telemetered male dogs, locomotor activity was increased by solriamfetol (4, 13 and 42 mg/kg 
PO) at all doses tested in a dose-dependent manner (measured (Cmax)-values correspond to 0.6×, 1.8×, and 
6.3×  the  human  expected  steady-state  Cmax  of  1,880  ng/mL  for  a  daily  solriamfetol  dose  of  300  mg) 
(JNJ-TOX-6188). 
Rotarod performance: Solriamfetol produced a dose-dependent reduction of rotarod performance in mice with a 
half-maximal toxic dose of 1,618 mg/kg (Imipramine 116 mg/kg)(Yukong 1868) 
Hexobarbital-induced hypnosis: Solriamfetol (30 and 100 mg/kg PO) did not potentiate the depressant effects 
of hexobarbital but reduced the mean sleeping time duration (Imipramine 100 mg/kg PO increased the duration 
of sleeping time) (Yukong PCOL-95-7). 
Antidepressant and anxiolytic properties  
Anxiogenic liability: Metrazol (40 mg/kg PO), a known anxiogenic, produced an anxiogenic response as indicated 
by  a  significant  reduction  in  percentage  open-arm  time  compared  with  the  vehicle-treated  group  in  a  rat 
elevated-plus  maze  and  spontaneous  motor  activity  test.  Solriamfetol  (5,  10  and  35  mg/kg  PO)  produced 
responses similar to vehicle at all doses tested (JNJ-15756).  
Reserpine-induced  hypothermia:  Solriamfetol  antagonized  reserpine-induced  hypothermia  in  mice  in  a 
dose-dependent manner, with an ED50 of 37.8 mg/kg (imipramine ED50 40,3 mg/kg) (Yukong PCOL 95-5). 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 23/128 
  
  
 
 
Tetrabenazine  (VMAT-2  inhibitor)-induced  ptosis:  Solriamfetol  (10,  30  and  60  mg/kg  PO)  inhibited 
tetrabenazine-induced ptosis in mice with an ED50 of 33.2 mg/kg (imipramine ED50 1.6 mg/kg) (Yukong PCOL 
95-3). 
Fighting behaviour: Solriamfetol (15, 22 and 30 mg/kg PO) antagonized isolation-induced aggressive behavior 
of mice with an ED50 of 25.9 mg/kg (imipramine ED50 30 mg/kg) (Yukong PCOL 95-4).  
Differential reinforcement of low-rate 72-second (DRL-72) procedure: Solriamfetol (10, 30 and 55 mg/kg PO) 
produced a statistically significant dose-related increase in response rates and a decrease in rewards (similar to 
bupropion) (Vukong PCOL 96-1). 
Tail  suspension  test:  Solriamfetol  (3,  10,  30  mg/kg  IP)  decreased  immobility  in  mice  at  30  mg/kg 
(antidepressant effect) (JNJ-5550). 
Shock  avoidance  (Vogel)  test:  Solriamfetol  (30  mg/kg  IP)  had  no  significant  effect.  Diazepam  (positive 
control)-treated animals took significantly more shocks than vehicle. The results indicate that solriamfetol does 
not possess anxiolytic properties (Yukong PCOL 96-2). 
Forced Swim (Behavioral Despair): Solriamfetol produced a reduction in the duration of immobility in mice (ED50 
16.6  mg/kg  single  applcation,  ED50  5.5  mg/kg  multipe-dose)  and  rats  (ED50  18.5  mg/kg  single  dose)  as  a 
measure of antidepressant activity (Yukong PCOL 95-1). 
A significant reduction in the duration of immobility in mice by solriamfetol was also observed in another study, 
whereas the enatiomer of solriamfetol was inactive (Yukong PCOL 96-6). 
Solriamfetol produced a reduction in the duration of immobility in mice (ED50 13.6 mg/kg) and rats (ED50 7.4 
mg/kg) following a 6-minute preliminary swimming session 1 day before experimentation (Yukong PCOL 95-2). 
A linear correlation (r2=0.96) was observed between reduction of immobility and peak plasma concentration in 
Wistar rats for doses between 5 and 35 mg/kg (Yukong 96-05). 
Anticholinergic activity 
Oxotremorine-induced tremors: Neither solriamfetol (100 mg PO) nor its enantiomer antagonized the tremors 
induced by oxotremorine, suggesting that neither compound has the potential to produce anticholinergic side 
effects (Yukong PCOL 95-8). 
Cognitive Performance  
Water maze test: Solriamfetol (3, 10, 30 mg/kg SC) had no effect on memory storage and retention in the water 
maze test in mice (JNJ-6751). 
Acquisition of visual discrimination: Animals treated with 3 or 30 mg/kg of solriamfetol or with D-amphetamine 
1 mg/kg needed fewer trials to reach criterion levels of performance and had better accuracy scores relative to 
vehicle-treated rats. It was concluded that solriamfetol enhanced behavioral performance in this task similar to 
D-amphetamine (JNJ-4015). 
5-choice serial reaction time task: Solriamfetol did not affect the attentional measures in this task (response 
accuracy and number of omissions), but the highest dose of solriamfetol increased the number of premature and 
perseverative responses (JNJ-2397).

Seizure Potential  
Maximal electroshock test: Solriamfetol (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg PO) displayed protective effects in the maximal 
electroshock test in mice (ED50 81.6 mg) (Yukong PCOL 95-13). 
Comparative toxicity of solriamfetol and bupropion: Solriamfetol produced ataxia, hypermotility, prostration, 
fore and hind limb extension, tremors, and loss of righting reflex at doses of 200 to 600 mg/kg IP. Doses of 800 
and 1,000 mg/kg produced loss of the righting reflex, dyspnea, and death. Solriamfetol did not elicit seizures at 
any  time.  Bupropion  produced  ataxia,  prostration,  and  fore-  and  hind-limb  extension  at  100  mg/kg,  clonic 
seizures,  spasms,  and loss  of  righting  reflex  at  200  mg/kg,  and  clonic  seizures,  dyspnea,  and  death  at  300 
mg/kg (Yukong 7316). 
Pentylenetetrazole test: Solriamfetol 30 mg/kg PO was not pro-convulsant in the pentylenetetrauole test in mice 
(JNJ-8742).  
Coadministration  with  biphenylacetic  acid:  Solriamfetol  (30  or  100  mg/kg  PO)  does  not  exhibit  convulsant 
effects when co-administered with biphenylacetic acid, an active metabolite (GABAA-receptor antagonist) of the 
NSAID fenbufen (JNJ-8742). 
Effects on food intake 
Food  intake  in  rats:  Like  amphetamine,  solriamfetol  lowered  treated-feed  consumption  and  lowered  body 
weights during the treated-feed periods (Yukong 95-4a). 
Animals treated with vehicle or solriamfetol ingested more food than those treated with amphetamine (control 
agent).  When  solriamfetol  was  combined  with  amphetamine,  food  intake  was  not  reduced  any  further 
suggesting that solriamfetol does not potentiate the effects of amphetamine (Yukong PCOL 95-10). 
Food  intake  in  food  deprived  and  non-food  deprived  mice:  It  was  concluded  that  solriamfetol  induced  clear 
anorexic effects in mice at dosages ≥60 mg/kg SC (JNJ-7006). 
In  non-deprived  animals  treated  at  the  beginning  of  the  light  phase,  solriamfetol  (60  and  120  mg/kg  SC) 
induced a significant decrease in food intake.  
Functional observational battery (FOB) 
As requested in the EMA scientific advice given in 2017 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/716502/2017), a FOB study was 
conducted. Juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats were given solriamfetol (35, 110, 200, 300 mg/kg) or control (0.9% 
saline) once daily PO from postnatal day (PND) 21 through PND 111, followed by a recovery phase of 10 weeks 
(GLP study 20091367) A full conventional FOB was performed on PND 87 (± 2 days) and on PND 145 (± 2 days), 
that included evaluation of a brought spectrum of CNS/neurological effects (e.g. home cage behaviour, reaction 
to removing and handling, defecation and urination in “open” field, gait pattern and abnormalities, abnormal 
respiration,  tactile/auditory/tail-pinch  reaction,  extensor  thrust  reflex,  forelimb  and  hindlimb  grip  test).  No 
relevant solriamfetol-related effects on FOB variables were evident at PND 87 and during the recovery phase at 
PND 145. Toxicokinetic data have not been provided, however, it can be expected that the applied dose range 
has covered and clearly exceeded the clinical exposure range of solriamfetol. Overall, these data do not give 
cause for concern concerning adverse CNS/neurological effects of solriamfetol

Cardiovascular system 
In in vivo cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies with anesthetized rats, guinea pigs, dogs or in conscious, 
unrestrained telemeterized Beagle dogs, solriamfetol did not result in prolonged QT interval corrected for heart 
rate (QTc) but demonstrated transient effects on blood pressure parameters and cardiac output. 
Anesthetized rats: Solriamfetol (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg IV) produced a dose-dependent reduction in systolic 
blood pressure and a decrease in heart rate over a 10-minute experimental period. Solriamfetol had no apparent 
effect on the ECG.  
Solriamfetol  did  not  potentiate  the  pressor  effects  of  tyramine,  and,  in  fact,  appeared  to  antagonize  them, 
suggesting that solriamfetol is not a MAO inhibitor (Yukong PCOL 95-14). 
Anaesthetized guinea pigs: Increasing doses of solriamfetol (0.16 to 5 mg/kg IV; total dose 9.85 mg/kg IV) had 
no statistically significant effect on heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and PQ, QRS, QT, and corrected 
QTc (by Bazett formula) ECG intervals. No changes in ECG morphology were noted during the postdosing period. 
Cmax  at  the  highest  dose  was  2.7×  the  human  expected  steady-state  Cmax  of  1,88  ng/mL  based  on  a  daily 
solriamfetol dose of 300 mg PO (JNJ-CPF-533). 
Open-chest anesthetized dogs: Solriamfetol (3.5 and 10 mg/kg IV) produced no biologically relevant effects on 
cardiac  output,  left  ventricular  pressure,  left  ventricular  end  diastolic  pressure,  intraventricular  pressure, 
systemic blood pressure, and ECG variables. A slight decrease in cardiac output and increases in blood pressure 
(systolic, diastolic and mean) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure were observed for solriamfetol 35 mg/kg 
IV. The values returned to baseline by 60 minutes after dosing. 
Instrumented, conscious dogs: Solriamfetol (5 mg/kg PO) had no effect on heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac 
contractility,  cardiac  relaxation,  pressure  rate  product,  cardiac  output,  stroke  volume,  systemic  vascular 
resistance,  QRS  and  QT  intervals,  QT  dispersion,  and  ECG  morphology.  Solriamfetol  tended  to  increase  the 
duration of the PQ interval and tended to decrease slightly the duration of the QTc (Bazett, Fridericia, and Van 
de Water corrections). Peak solriamfetol plasma concentration was 2,138 ng/mL 60 minutes after dosing, which 
is 1.1× the human expected steady-state Cmax of 1,880 ng/mL based on a daily solriamfetol dose of 300 mg PO 
(JNJ-CPF-536). 
Telemetered  male  dogs:  Effects  of  solriamfetol on  cardiovascular  function  were  evaluated  in  a  GLP  study  in 
telemetered, conscious, unrestrained male beagle dogs. Solriamfetol (4 mg/kg PO) had no marked effects on 
blood pressure and heart rate. For solriamfetol (13 mg/kg PO), a slight, transient increase in blood pressure was 
evident 2 hours after dosing that was accompanied by an increase in respiratory rate over 2 to 4 hours, a slight 
decrease in respiratory tidal volume 2 hours after treatment, and an increase in locomotor activity for up to 11 
hours after dosing. A slight increase in heart rate was considered possibly related to the increase in locomotor 
activity. Solriamfetol (42 mg/kg PO) resulted in significant increases in systolic blood pressure (versus control 
values) and percentage changes of diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure (versus control values) at 
30 minutes after dosing. Respiratory rate was markedly increased and tidal volume slightly decreased over a 
period of 2 to 4 hours after dosing. Locomotor activity was increased over a 10-hour period starting 2 hours after 
dosing. Mean plasma concentrations in samples taken approximately 70 minutes (≈tmax)) after doses of 4, 13 
and 42 mg/kg solriamfetol represented multiples of 0.6×, 1.8× and 6.3× the human expected steady-state Cmax 
for a daily solriamfetol dose of 300 mg PO (JNJ-TOX-6188). 
Dogs, in repeated-dose toxicity studies: In a 3-month study where solriamfetol was administered at 8, 15 and 
23  mg/kg/day  PO,  no  treatment-related  ECG  findings  were  observed  during  the  fourth  and  last  weeks  of 
treatment (Pharmakon-0470DY01-002).  
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 26/128 
  
  
 
In  a  1-year  study  with  a  3  month  recovery  period,  in  which  dogs  were  given  daily  doses  of  8,  21  and  42 
mg/kg/day PO solriamfetol, cardiovascular examinations were performed pretest and during Weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 
39, 52 and 65. Slight variations in heart rate, cardiac conduction, cardiac rhythm, and wave forms were not 
considered treatment related and were of no toxicological relevance. 
In male and female Beagle dogs dosed once daily with a slow bolus IV injection with 4, 8 and 13 mg/kg/day 
solriamfetol for 2 consecutive weeks, ECGs and heart rates were measured prior to the start of dosing and on 
Day 14 (30 minutes after dosing). No solriamfetol-related arrhythmias were noted in any dog (JNJ-TOX-6574). 
Respiratory System 
Telemetered  male  dogs:  Effects  of  solriamfetol on  cardiovascular  function  were  evaluated  in  a  GLP  study  in 
telemetered,  conscious,  unrestrained  male  beagle  dogs.  Single  increasing  doses  of  4,  13  or  42  mg/kg  PO 
solriamfetol  produced  vomiting,  restlessness,  transient  dose-dependent  increase  in  respiratory  rates  and 
decreased tidal volumes. At 13 mg/kg solriamfetol, respiratory rate was increased from 2 to 4 hours postdose 
with a slight decrease in tidal volume 2 hours postdose. At 42 mg/kg solriamfetol, respiratory rate was markedly 
increased,  and  tidal  volume  was  slightly  decreased  from  2  to  4  hours  postdose.  Increased  locomotion  may 
explain the increased respiratory rate (JNJ-TOX-6574). 
Renal System 
Study in rats:  As part of a non-GLP mechanistic study, rats were given a high daily dose of solriamfetol (379 
mg/kg  PO)  for  3  weeks.  No  substantial  adverse  effects  were  noted  in  clinical  chemistry  and  urinalysis 
parameters (decreased urine pH, increased urine volume), and no changes in kidney weight or gross pathologic 
findings, however, swelling and vacuolation were noted with light and electron microscopy in papilla, collecting 
ducts, and thin loop of Henle, and/or pelvic epithelium. No changes in plasma or urinary parameters indicative 
of kidney injury and no changes in mRNA levels of 4 genes in kidney tissue, identified in the literature as being 
implicated in kidney toxicity (KIM-1, LCN2, Clu, and SPP1/osteopontin), were noted.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with solriamfetol have been conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of solriamfetol was evaluated in vitro and in single- and repeat-dose in 
vivo studies. The majority of studies in mice, rats, and dogs evaluated solriamfetol formulated in saline or water 
as a solution for PO or IV administration. In several studies in dogs, solriamfetol was formulated as powder in a 
capsule.  In  studies  with  high-dose  administration,  solriamfetol  was  occasionally  formulated  as  an  aqueous 
methylcellulose suspension. 
Absorption 
After  oral  dosing  with  14C-solriamfetol,  based  on  percentage  recovery  of  radioactivity  in  the  0-96  hour  or 
0-168-hour urine samples, the absorption of radioactivity across the gastrointestinal tract was estimated to be 
at least 63% to 73% in rats, 85% in dogs, and 96% in humans.  
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 27/128 
  
  
 
 
 
The  absorption  of  solriamfetol  across  gut  epithelial  membranes  is  predominantly  governed  by  a  passive 
transcellular mechanism and absorptive transport (apical to basolateral) increased with an increasing pH (6 to 
7.4)  where  greater  concentrations  of  solriamfetol  exist  in  the  non-ionized  state  more  suitable  for  passive 
diffusion across epithelial membranes.  
Generally, no marked sex differences in solriamfetol exposure were noted in the species evaluated. 
Systemic  exposures  to  solriamfetol  (Cmax,  AUC))  were  approximately  dose  proportional  or  slightly 
supra-proportional following single and repeated dosing.  
In rats and dogs, exposure to solriamfetol after repeated dosing was similar to that after a single dose, although 
slight accumulation was detected in rats, especially at higher doses.  
Distribution 
Solriamfetol plasma protein binding in animals and humans was low, ranging from 8.4% in rabbit and dog to 
19.4% in human, and concentration independent.  
In  rats  and  dogs,  the  blood-to-plasma  concentration  ratio  for  14C-solriamfetol-derived  radioactivity  was 
approximately 1, indicating a small extent of binding and/or distribution into blood cells.  
The apparent volume of distribution of solriamfetol (2.08 to 9.35 L/kg) in animals exceeded total blood volume, 
indicating extensive tissue distribution beyond the vascular compartment. 
Solriamfetol distributed rapidly to systemic tissues in the rat with high concentrations in the excretory organs, 
liver and kidney, consistent with its route of elimination.  
Following oral administration of 14C-solriamfetol to pigmented rats, total radioactivity peaked at 5 hours post 
dose and declined rapidly thereafter with similar rates of decline in blood and non-pigmented tissues. 
Among non-pigmented tissues, a substantially higher tissue-to-blood AUC ratio was found in the kidney and 
liver, which is consistent with the kidney and liver being excretory organs for solriamfetol in the rat.  
14C-solriamfetol-related  radioactivity  appeared  to  bind  to  melanin  and  distribution  of  total  radioactivity  was 
highest in the eye, especially the ciliary body and choroid. The decline of radioactivity in pigmented structures 
was  slower  than  in  other  tissues;  however,  no  undue  retention  of  radioactivity  was  observed  with  residual 
concentrations at the last time point representing only 1% to 2% of peak total radioactivity. 
Although  solriamfetol  is  a  basic,  charged,  hydrophilic  molecule,  it  crosses  the  blood-brain  barrier  with 
radioactivity concentrations in whole brain similar to blood. The duration of exposure to solriamfetol in brain ECF 
was  longer  than  the  duration  observed  in  plasma,  which  may  contribute  to  a  longer  pharmacological  effect 
relative to its short elimination half-life.  
14C-solriamfetol-related radioactivity crossed the placenta in pregnant rats. The AUC for total radioactivity in the 
whole fetus was slightly lower than in maternal blood (0.80-fold), while the AUC for total radioactivity in the fetal 
membrane was 2.61-fold higher than maternal blood. 
14C-solriamfetol-related radioactivity distributed into the mammary gland; the AUC for total radioactivity in the 
mammary gland was 1.56-fold higher than in maternal blood.  
Solriamfetol  binds  to  melanin;  however,  based  on  UV  absorbance  maximum  of  258  nm,  solriamfetol  is  not 
considered sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity.

Metabolism 
The  overall  metabolic  pathway  of  solriamfetol  in  the  liver  includes  aliphatic  hydroxylation  (M7),  aromatic 
hydroxylation  (M5),  carbamate  hydrolysis  (M8),  glucuronidation  (M1),  alcohol  oxidation  (M4),  N-acetylation 
(M11), glutathione conjugation (M2), and premercapturic acid formation (M13/M14).  
Solriamfetol exhibits interspecies differences in metabolism. While solriamfetol undergoes significant hepatic 
metabolism in rats, very limited hepatic metabolism was observed in dogs and humans, both in vitro and in vivo. 
There are no unique human metabolites. Minor inactive metabolite, M11 (N-acetyl solriamfetol), observed in 
human urine, is also present in the toxicology species. Therefore, safety risks for solriamfetol and its metabolites 
are fully evaluated in the toxicology program.  
Excretion recovery of  14C-solriamfetol-related radioactivity in rats, dogs, and human was complete (≥93%), 
which suggests that no significant reactive metabolites are formed in vivo.  
In  rat,  dog,  and  human  plasma,  unchanged  solriamfetol  was  the  major  radioactive  component.  The  major 
metabolite in rat plasma was the glucuronide conjugate of the p-hydroxy metabolite (M1); no major metabolite 
was observed in dog and human plasma. The minor inactive metabolite M11 (N-acetyl solriamfetol), identified 
in  human  urine,  was  also  detected  in  rat  plasma.  Overall,  no  clear  sex  differences  in  the  metabolism  of 
solriamfetol were observed in rats. 
No chiral inversion of solriamfetol to its S-enantiomer was observed in any species.  
Apart from a low inhibitory potential toward cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, solriamfetol was not found to be a 
substrate or inhibitor for any of the major human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in vitro.  
Weak,  reversible  induction  of  CYP3A  and  CYP2B  activity  was  observed  in  rats  in  vivo.  No  effect  on  uridine 
5'-diphospho  (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase  activity  was  observed  and  solriamfetol  was  not  a  peroxisome 
proliferator. 
Excretion 
Elimination was relatively rapid with half-life values following oral administration of 1 to 2 hours in mice, 2 to 4 
hours  in  rats  (longer  in  chronic  studies  at  high  doses),  and  4  to  5  hours  in  dogs,  with  no  unexpected 
accumulation with repeated administration. 
Solriamfetol clearance in rats was about 4 L/h/kg, approximately equivalent to hepatic blood flow in this species 
(3.3 L/h/kg). By contrast, lower clearance was observed in dogs, about 0.35 L/h/kg, compared with hepatic 
blood flow of 1.86 L/h/kg (Davies and Morris 1993). 
Significant excretion of solriamfetol was found in milk following oral administration in rats, with concentrations 
higher  than  those  in  plasma.  Solriamfetol  is  not  excreted  in  expired  air  and  may  undergo  minor  biliary  or 
transepithelial elimination in rats.  
In humans, solriamfetol is excreted almost entirely in urine and nearly all as unchanged drug (≥95%), with a 
minor  metabolite  (N-acetyl  solriamfetol)  accounting  for  ≤1%  of  the  dose  excreted  in  urine  (CSR 
R228060-P01-101).  Feces  accounted  for  a  negligible  amount  of  unabsorbed  solriamfetol  and  as  a  result,  a 
metabolic profile in feces was not determined.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Comprehensive in vitro CYP and uptake/efflux transporter studies using human biomaterials with solriamfetol 
were conducted. According to the presented data, PK interactions through drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug 
transporters are unlikely to occur in patients taking solriamfetol.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single oral doses of solriamfetol were well tolerated by mice, rats, and dogs up to 600, 750, and 140 mg/kg, 
respectively. Clinical signs were mainly related to CNS stimulation in all species. In addition to these signs, dogs 
also  exhibited  salivation,  mydriasis,  panting,  and/or  marked  transient  elevation  of  body  temperature  that 
abated by 24 hours post dose. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies of durations up to 3 months in mice, 6 months in rats, and 12 months in dogs 
resulted in dose-related CNS effects similar to those observed after single doses.  
Mice: In a pivotal 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study, daily oral doses of 17, 168 and 505 mg/kg solriamfetol 
caused dose-related CNS effects. In addition, lower body weight gain with reduced hepatocellular glycogen and 
subcutaneous  fat,  centrilobular  hepatocellular  hypertrophy,  and  increased  protein  casts  and  regenerating 
epithelium in renal tubules were observed. The NOAEL was considered to be 17 mg/kg. 
Toxicokinetics: The 17 mg/kg/day dose resulted in mean Cmax-values of 3.07 µg/ml (males 3.03 µg/ml,  females 
3.11 µg/ml) and a mean AUC0-24h of 2.96 µg•h/mL (males 3.06 µg•h/mL, females 2.85 µg•h/mL) at day 86 of 
the dosing phase, which corresponds to about 0.35-fold the predicted steady-state human solriamfetol exposure 
at 150 mg/day (estimated human AUC0-24h = 8.548 µg•h/mL).  
Rats: In a pivotal 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study with a 3-month recovery period, daily oral doses of 29, 
253  and  505  (reduced  to  379  at  study  day  93  because  of  overt  toxicity)  mg/kg  solriamfetol  produced 
CNS-related clinical signs. Mortality and early death were seen at 505/379 mg/kg. Hepatocellular hypertrophy 
and increased incidence of foamy macrophages in the lungs (consistent with phospholipidosis) were observed at 
all dose levels. In kidneys, solriamfetol caused diuresis and vacuolation of renal epithelium in distal tubules and 
collecting ducts.  
Other effects observed at ≥253 mg/kg/day were: swelling of zona fasciculata cells in adrenal glands of females, 
swollen/vacuolated  tubular  cells  in  the  renal  papilla  and/or  medulla  in  both  sexes  and  renal  cortical  tubular 
hypertrophy in females, increased eosinophilic corpora lutea and presence of cystic follicles in ovary, increased 
hemosiderin in the spleen of males, increased thymic involution in males, atrophic changes in adipose tissue, 
and  fibrinous  material  within  alveoli  and  bronchi  in  females.  Additional  other  effects  at  505/379  mg/kg/day 
were:  more  prominent  granulopoiesis  in  the  sternal  bone  marrow  of  females,  multifocal  vacuolation  of  the 
cerebral cortex and presence of shrunken, dark-staining neurons in the hippocampus with perivascular edema 
in females that died or were euthanized early, hepatocellular necrosis in females that died or were euthanized 
early, hypotrichosis in the skin of females, increase in tertiary follicles in the ovary, and dilated urinary bladder 
in males.

The observed changes were not all completely reversible. At the end of a 3-month recovery period, effects in 
adrenal  glands,  lungs  (females),  and  skin  (males)  showed  partial  recovery,  all  other  effects  had  resolved 
completely (JNJ-TOX-5705). A NOAEL could not be determined in this study. 
Toxicokinetics: The 29 mg/kg/day dose (LOAEL) resulted in mean Cmax-values of 4.30 µg/ml (males 4.87 µg/ml,  
females 3.72 µg/ml) and a mean AUC0-24h of 12.15 µg•h/mL (males 10.6 µg•h/mL, females 13.7 µg•h/mL) at 
day  177  of  the  dosing  phase,  which  corresponds  to  about  1.42-fold  the  predicted  steady-state  human 
solriamfetol exposure at the MRHD of 150 mg/day (estimated human AUC0-24h =8.548 µg•h/mL). 
The lowest dose with only partially reversible changes (253 mg/kg/day) resulted in mean Cmax-values of 21.7 
μg/mL (males 17.1 μg/mL, females, 25.2 μg/mL) and a mean exposures of AUC0-24h of 161.370 µg•h/mL (males 
127.4 μg•h/mL, females 195.4 μg•h/mL) on day 177 of the dosing phase that corresponds to about 18.9-fold 
the predicted steady-state human solriamfetol exposure at the MRHD. 
Dogs: In a pivotal 12-month repeat-dose toxicity study with a 13-week recovery period, solriamfetol given in 
two divided daily oral doses of (total) 8, 21, or 42 mg/kg caused hyperactivity/agitation and transient weight 
loss at all dose levels (JNJ-TOX-5706). At doses ≥21 mg/kg/day panting, salivation, unsteady gait, subdued 
behavior/reduced activity, weakness of hindquarters, crawling, barking, or stereotypical movements were noted 
along  with  slightly  increased  heart  rate.  At  42  mg/kg/day,  there  was  a  trend  toward  slightly  decreased 
(generally  <10%)  RBC  parameters  and  serum  calcium  concentration  tended  to  be  lower.  Effects  on  lungs, 
adrenal  glands  and  skin  were  only  partially  reversible  during  a  3-month  recovery  period.  The  NOAEL  was 
considered  by  the  Applicant  to  be  8  mg/kg/day,  which  is  not  agreed  since  adverse  effects  (decreased  body 
weight  and  food  consumption  compared  with  controls  in  female  dogs;  hyperactivity/agitation,  panting, 
salivation) were already observed at this dose. 
Toxicokinetics:  The  dose of  8  mg/kg/day  (LOAEL)  resulted  in  mean  Cmax-values  of  1.39/1.61  µg/mL  (males 
1.39/1.44 μg/mL, females 1.39/1.77 μg/mL) and mean AUC0-24h values of 14.6 μg•h/mL (males 15.1 μg•h/mL, 
females 14.1 μg•h/mL) at Week 52 of the dosing phase, which corresponds to about 1.70-fold the predicted 
steady-state  human  solriamfetol  exposure  at  the  MRHD  of  150  mg/day  (estimated  human  AUC0-24h  =8.548  
µg•h/mL). 
In summary, animal-to-human exposure ratios (calculated on basis of clinical exposure at the MRHD of 150 
mg/day),  were <1 for mice (based on NOAEL) and <2 for rats and dogs (based on LOAEL).  
Genotoxicity 
Solriamfetol was tested in standard in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. While solriamfetol was negative in 
all in vitro tests, it was slightly positive in an IP mouse micronucleus test. However, these findings were not 
dose-related  and  within  the  historical  control  ranges  of  the  testing  facility.  Reassuringly,  solriamfetol  was 
negative in a second oral mouse micronucleus test at sufficient exposure. Taken together, solriamfetol can be 
considered as not genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long-term oral carcinogenicity studies have been performed in mice, treated with daily solriamfetol doses of 20, 
65 and 200 mg/kg for up to 104 weeks, and in rats, treated with daily solriamfetol doses of 35, 80 and 200 
mg/kg for up to 101 weeks. Solriamfetol did not increase the incidence of neoplastic findings in these lifetime 
carcinogenicity assays. AUC-based safety margins at the high dose to the maximal recommended human dose 
(MRHD, 150 mg/day) were about 7.8 in mice and about 20.7 in rats. In the light of negative genotoxicity and no 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 31/128 
  
  
 
increase of tumor incidence in both carcinogenicity studies, it can be concluded that solriamfetol does not pose 
a carcinogenic risk to humans.  
Compared  to  controls,  cumulative  survival  rates  in  week  104  were  (numerically)  decreased  in 
solriamfetol-treated mice, maximal at a dose of 65 mg/kg/day (AUC-based safety margin to MRHD about 2.9) 
from 70% (control) to 48% (p-value 0.0074) in male mice and from 63% to 45% (p-value 0.0923) in female 
mice. A decrease in survival rate in the solriamfetol-treated groups was not observed in the rat study.  
In general, the identified causes of premature death were of the types commonly seen in studies using mice of 
the tested strain and age. However, the decreased survival rates in the mid and high dose solriamfetol-treated 
groups appeared to be associated with an increased incidence of premature death of undetermined cause (i.e. 
for which no histologic/macroscopic reason could be identified), amounting to 18.3% and 16.7% versus 6.6% 
(control) for male mice and 11.7% and 13.3% versus 6.6% for female mice.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Sexual behaviour and fertility 
In a non GLP compliant study it was shown that treatment of female rats with solriamfetol did not suppress 
female sexual behaviour. 
Possible solriamfetol related effects on male and female fertility were evaluated in separate studies. 
Neither male nor female fertility was negatively influenced up to the highest doses tested, despite clinical signs 
and  body  weight  reductions,  which  had  to  be  expected,  based  on  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  the 
substance. 
Although lower fertility indices were noted for males in the mid and high dose groups, this was not considered 
relevant as the values were in the range of the historical control data. In addition, the significantly reduced 
sperm  count  and  sperm  concentration  observed  in  high  dose  males,  apparently  had  no  impact  on  male 
reproductive capacity. Accordingly, the NOAEL for male fertility is 350 mg/kg/d, the highest dose tested. 
Likewise,  female  fertility  was  not  affected,  and  again  despite  of  clinical  signs  and  adverse  effects  on  body 
weights in the mid and high dose groups. In the study report, no NOAEL for female fertility was proposed due to 
the non-dosage related increase in the numbers of corpora lutea in the groups receiving solriamfetol. Whilst still 
being within the normal control ranges, in view of the findings in the 90-day rat study, where necropsy and 
subsequent histopathology showed an increase in ovarian weight, prominent corpora lutea and para-ovarian 
cysts, the involvement of solriamfetol in this finding was not excluded. According to the pathology report of the 
90-day study, there was no clear evidence of any substance related impairment of female fertility. Furthermore, 
prolactin levels were not adversely affected by chronic solriamfetol treatment for 6 months in rats. But anyway, 
even if a drug-related effect on the ovars cannot be dispelled totally, this had no impact on female fertility in the 
current study. Thus, the NOAEL for female fertility is 350 mg/kg/d, the highest dose tested.  
Embryofoetal development 
Possible  effects  on  embryofoetal  development  were  investigated  in  rats  and  rabbits,  respectively.  In  both 
species, developmental toxicity (significantly increased post implantation loss in rats and significantly decreased 
foetal  weights  in  both  species)  was  obvious  at  maternal  toxic  doses  only.  In  addition,  in  rat  foetuses  an 
increased number of skeletal anomalies were observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 32/128 
  
  
 
 
Whether developmental toxicity was a consequence of maternal toxicity or a direct effect of solriamfetol cannot 
be determined. In a distribution study in pregnant 14C-solriamfetol was detected in foetal membrane (around 
twice as high as in blood), placenta and whole foetus (nearly similar to blood concentration) and thus a direct 
toxic effect on the foetus cannot be excluded. No malformations were noted in any species.  
In rats the NOAEL for both maternal and developmental toxicity is 18 mg/kg/d based on significantly decreased 
maternal  body  weights  and  significantly  increased  postimplantation  loss  at  higher  dosages.  In  rabbits,  the 
NOAEL for prenatal development set at 90 mg/kg/d (high dose) in the study report is not accepted, as foetal 
body weights were significantly decreased in high dose foetuses. Based on significantly decreased maternal and 
foetal body weights in the high dose group, the NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity is 45 mg/kg/d.  
Prenatal and postnatal development 
When pregnant rats were dosed from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 with increasing doses of solriamfetol, 
effects (clinical signs and significantly decreased body weights) correlated with those effects observed in other 
toxicity  studies  performed  in  rats.  Based  on  significant  body  weight  reduction  at  doses  ≥  110  mg/kg/d,  the 
NOAEL for maternal toxicity has to be set at 35 mg/kg/d. 
With respect to the F1 generation, the NOAEL for viability, growth and development is 35 mg/kg/d, too, as an 
increase in pup mortality, decreased pup body weights and as a consequence of lower body weights delayed 
sexual  maturation  were  noted  at  higher  doses  (≥  110  mg/kg/d).  Learning  and  memory  functions  were  not 
impaired up to the highest dose tested (350 mg/kg/d). Regarding the NOAEL for F1-reproduction, the dosage 
proposed in the study report, is not agreed, as the number of males that mated as well as the number of females 
that became pregnant was reduced. Hence, the NOAEL for reproduction for the F1 generation should be set at 
110  mg/kg/d.  Toxicokinetic  investigations  performed  on  lactation  day  15  revealed  a  mean  solriamfetol 
milk-to-plasma ratios of approximately 3 to 4 among all groups at 0.75 hours postdose. 
Safety margins related to adverse findings in reproductive toxicity studies 
Unfortunately,  toxicokinetic  (TK)  investigations have  not been  performed in  any  of  the  reproductive toxicity 
studies  except  for  Cmax  concentrations  in  milk  and  plasma  samples  on  lactation  day  15  in  the  prenatal  and 
postnatal development study. 
Calculation of the safety margins for parameters of reproduction (fertility, prenatal and postnatal development) 
in rats was therefore based on TK data obtained in the 90-day toxicity study in rats. While the exposure at the 
NOAELs for male and female fertility were 2 and 19 times the human exposure (AUC) at the MRHD, there was 
apparently no safety margin at all with regard to embryofoetal and postnatal development (0.6 – 0.7 times).  
For rabbits no TK data are available. Using the HED concept the safety margin for maternal and developmental 
toxicity is approximately 5, when calculated as multiples of the maximum human dose based on mg/m2 body 
surface  area.  Due  to  the  insufficient  exposure  at  the  NOAELs  especially  in  the  prenatal  and  postnatal 
development studies in rats, which resulted in no safety margins at all, reproductive toxicity should be included 
as a potential important risk in the RMP.

Mechanistic studies 
A high oral dose of solriamfetol (379 mg/kg) was administered once daily to rats for a period of 3 consecutive 
weeks to determine biomarkers for the effects of solriamfetol on kidney and fat tissue/lipid metabolism noted in 
the general toxicity studies and to get insight into the underlying mechanism of action for solriamfetol-induced 
renal  effects.  The  results  substantiated  the  conclusion  that  solriamfetol-induced  kidney  effects  can  be 
considered to be of a reactive nature.  
During a three-week toxicity study in male rats (Study JNJ-TOX-6895) with a high dose (450 mg/kg/day) of 
solriamfetol, a (numerical) increase in corticosterone plasma levels (corticosterone is the main glucocorticoid in 
rats) and of vasopressin recovered in urine was observed. 
Dependence 
In  a  rat  self-administration  model  used  to  test  reinforcing  properties,  solriamfetol  showed  no  clear  abuse 
potential. Solriamfetol decreased cocaine self-administration in rats and monkeys. In rats, solriamfetol showed 
no significant rewarding properties in the place-preference model, except a trend toward an increased place 
preference  at  the  highest  dose  tested  (90  mg/kg).  In  drug  discrimination  procedures,  solriamfetol  partially 
generalized to the discriminative stimulus effects of amphetamine in rats and completely generalized to the 
discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine in rats and monkeys. Effects of solriamfetol on locomotion in various 
rodent  studies  were  not  definitively  established,  with  effects  ranging  from  no  to  little  effect,  an  increase  in 
locomotion that was about 60% of that observed with the cocaine control, to effects similar to those of modafinil 
and amphetamine.  
Impurities 
Solriamfetol  and  seven  related  specified impurities  (NMT  0.15%)  were  tested in  silico  (statistical based and 
expert rule-based systems) for potential mutagenicity according to ICH M7(R1). None of the compounds was 
predicted  to  be  genotoxic.  Furthermore,  seven  potentially  genotoxic  impurities  have  been  identified  in  the 
manufacturing process. All of them will be controlled below the TTC of 1.5 µg/day according to ICH M7(R1), 
resulting in a limit of NMT 10 ppm based on the MRHD of 150 mg solriamfetol. 
Other studies 
Phototoxicity:  As  solriamfetol  did  not  absorb  light  at  wavelengths  between  290  and  700  nm  and  its  molar 
extinction coefficient was <1,000 L/mol/cm (Jazz PD Memo 585-00), it meets the ICH S10 guidance criteria 
(which supplements the ICH M3(R2) guideline) for compounds that are not considered sufficiently photoreactive 
to result in direct phototoxicity.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
In vitro studies 
Studies to characterize effects of solriamfetol on uptake and release of monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, 
serotonin) 
Data concerning interaction of solriamfetol with cloned human DAT, NET and SERT 
In radioligand-binding experiments with cells expressing cloned human receptors/transporters, solriamfetol 
showed affinity for the dopamine (replicate Ki=6.3 and 14.2 µM) and norepinephrine transporter (replicate Ki= 
3.7 and >10 µM) but no appreciable affinity to the serotonin transporter. Solriamfetol inhibited the reuptake of 
dopamine (replicate IC50=2.9 and 6.4 µM) and norepinephrine (IC50= 4.4 µM) but not of serotonin by these cells. 
This information has been included n SmPC section 5.1. 
Although the calculated Hill coefficients were in most cases different from 1, overall, a visual investigation of the 
graphs presented for the binding studies and for the functional assays did not suggest the presence of more than 
one binding site for solriamfetol per monoamine transporter. 
Potential species differences concerning effects of solriamfetol on uptake and release of dopamine and 
norepinephrine 
Mice, dogs and rabbits have been widely used in pharmacological and toxicological studies with solriamfetol. 
However, no specific data concerning interaction of solriamfetol with mouse, dog and rabbit DAT or NET have 
been provided by the Applicant. Human and rat in vitro data (IC50 for inhibition of dopamine uptake 2.9/6.4 µM 
versus 21 µM; stimulation of dopamine and serotonin release only in rat brain tissue) as well as in vivo data from 
different species (differences in effects on body temperature and sensitivity to stimulation of locomotion and 
sterotype movements) raised the question of species differences concerning the effects of solriamfetol on 
uptake and release of monoamines. However, based on a literature review provided by the Applicant, it can be 
agreed that an extrapolation of the animal safety data obtained with solriamfetol to the human situation is  
considered acceptable.

Studies to detect potential interactions of solriamfetol with other pharmacological targets 
In screening assays that evaluated the binding of solriamfetol to a wide variety of cloned human receptors, 
enzymes and transporters, no other relevant binding affinity of solriamfetol in concentrations of 1 µM 
respectively 10 µM was detected. However, taking into account that a Ki as high as 14.2 µM was observed for the 
human DAT and the fact that in vivo solriamfetol concentrations in some tissues (e.g. kidneys and eyes) may 
well reach the 100 µM range, the solriamfetol concentrations tested in the screening assays appear to be too low 
to allow for definite conclusions. The fact that the potential mechanism(s) of action of solriamfetol has/have not 
been fully characterized is expressed in SmPC section 5.1. 
In vivo studies 
Studies to characterize effects on uptake of monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin) 
Monoamine brain tissue levels: In proof of concept studies, a stimulatory effect of solriamfetol on striatal 
dopamine and prefrontal norepinephrine tissue levels of rats could be evidenced if tissue levels were normalized 
to a starting (t=0 min) level of 100% per treated animal (wheras serotonin levels were not stimulatied in either 
tissue). This information has been included in SmPC section 5.1. It may however be mentioned that measured 
absolute tissue levels of dopamine and norepinephrine were not significantly higher in the solriamfetol-treated 
groups than in the control groups. 
Binding studies: Following a single SC dose of 40 mg/kg to rats, a dose that results in clear wake-promoting 
effects in rats, no significant binding of solriamfetol to brain monoamine transporters (DAT, NET, and SERT) 
could be evidenced by autoradiography. This information has been included in SmPC section 5.1 
Studies on behavioural effects of solriamfetol 
Solriamfetol induced stimulatory CNS effects in rats, which, however, differed in several aspects from the effects 
induced by amphetamine, SSRIs or MAO inhibitors.  
In DAT knockout mice, solriamfetol demonstrated clear effects on CNS (e.g. locomotor, rearing, and stereotypy) 
activities, suggesting that the in vivo effects of solriamfetol are not solely mediated by DAT inhibition. 
In a proof of concept study in hypocretin/ataxin-3 transgenic mice (mouse model of narcolepsy), solriamfetol 
dose-dependently induced continuous wakefulness during the resting (light) and active (dark) phase. The wake 
amounts observed in narcoleptic mice in the active phase after solriamfetol administration were similar to those 
of wild-type mice, suggesting that solriamfetol normalized the sleep/wake activity of narcoleptic animals. 
Non-REM and REM sleep were reduced in narcoleptic mice by solriamfetol to the levels observed in wild-type 
mice. No abnormal EEG patterns were detected after solriamfetol administration and sleep time that occurred 
after the prolonged wakefulness was normal (no rebound hypersomnia). These results confirm a potential 
effectiveness in treating EDS in narcolepsy. 
In three inbred strains of mice, wakefulness induced by solriamfetol was followed by a compensatory rebound in 
both the duration and intensity (i.e., EEG delta power) of sleep but no evidence of rebound hypersomnolence 
(i.e., over-compensation for sleep lost). Brain transcriptome and clustering analyses indicated that the 
pharmacological pathways involved in the wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol may differ from those of 
amphetamine and modafinil. 
In rats, when administered at the acrophase of sleep (i.e at the beginning of the light period when most sleep 
would be expected to occur in rodents), treatment with solriamfetol at 30 mg/kg strongly influenced sleep-wake 
organization, increasing active wakefulness at the expense of time spent in light sleep, deep sleep and REM 
sleep during the first 3 to 4 hours after the administration. A rebound effect was seen between 4-10 hours 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 36/128 
  
  
 
following administration of the compound, as an increase in time spent in deep sleep that gradually decreased 
in the hours thereafter. Effects of solriamfetol differed in several aspects from the wake-promoting effects of 
cocaine and amphetamine. 
Safety pharmacology  
A large number of non-GLP and GLP in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies have been performed for 
solriamfetol to characterize effects on CNS and cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems, which overall, 
have not raised major serious safety concerns. 
With regard to the scientific advice given by the EMA in 2017 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/716502/2017) on safety 
pharmacology evaluation of solriamfetol 
• 
  the Applicant points to the fact that cardiovascular safety of solriamfetol has been evaluated in 
nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies (including a GLP-conform safety pharmacology study in conscious, 
unrestrained telemetered beagle dogs), as well as in clinical studies (including  the thorough QT study 
15-002) Since the QTc-prolonging potential of solriamfetol has been qualitatively and quantitatively 
characterized on basis of the aforementioned studies, the position of the Applicant not to repeat in vitro 
hERG and isolated cardiac tissue studies under formally GLP-compliant conditions appears acceptable. 
• 
concerning CNS safety pharmacology, the Applicant has submitted the requested  FOB study (conducted 
in juvenile rats) that showed no relevant no relevant solriamfetol-related effects on FOB variables. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions have not been evaluated for solriamfetol on the non-clinical level. Since  
knowledge about the pharmacodynamic interaction potential is considered import for a safe clinical use of 
solriamfetol,  the applicant was asked to discuss the pharmacodynamic interaction potential of solriamfetol on 
basis of the currenty proposed mechanism of action (inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine uptake in the 
CNS) and make proposals for inclusion of such information in the SmPC.  
In response the Applicant proposed to contraindicate the concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOI) or use of solriamfetol within 14 days after MAOI treatment has been discontinued because this may 
increase the risk of a hypertensive reaction. This proposal of the Applicant is supported and has been included 
in SmPC section 4.3 and 4.5. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical PK of solriamfetol has been evaluated in a comprehensive battery of studies. Since the primary 
rodent and nonrodent toxicology species were rats and dogs, the majority of PK evaluations were performed in 
these species, either in vivo or in vitro using prepared tissues of interest. Consistent with its classification as a 
BCS Class 1 drug, solriamfetol was rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration in the toxicology species 
and in humans. Single-dose PK of solriamfetol in nonclinical species was characterized by moderate to high oral 
bioavailability, rapid tmax, short half-life, moderate apparent volume of distribution, and low (dog) to high 
(mouse and rat) systemic clearance.  
With regard to distribution, high enrichment factors have been observed for several tissues, including the 
kidneys and the eye (and here in particular melanin-containing structures).  
The metabolisation rate was very low in humans and in the evaluated animal species, with the exception of the 
rat, where metabolisation contributes relevantly to solriamfetol elimination.

Excretion of (mainly unchanged) drug via the kidneys was observed in humans and in the evaluated animal 
species, with the exception of the rat, where faecal excretion contributed relevantly to drug elimination. 
Overall, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of solriamfetol have been sufficiently 
characterized in non-clinical species to support the use of solfriamfetol for the intended indication. 
Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single oral doses of solriamfetol were well tolerated by mice, rats, and dogs up to 600, 750, and 140 mg/kg, 
respectively. Clinical signs were mainly related to CNS stimulation in all species. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies have been performed in mice (up to 3 months), rats (up to 6 months with a 
3-month recovery period) and dogs (up to 12 months with a 13 weeks recovery period). 
Main target organs were the CNS (in connection with the primary pharmacological effect), liver, kidneys, 
adrenals and thymus. In the 6-month rat study and in the 12-month dog study a NOAEL could not be established 
(LOAELs were 29 mg/kg/day and 8 mg/kg/day, respectively).  For the 3-month mouse study  a NOAEL of 17 
mg/kg/day could be established. Some adverse effects were only partially reversible during the recovery period 
in the 6-month rat study (e.g. histopathological findings in adrenals and lungs) and the 12-month dog study 
(e.g. decrease in serum calcium). In summary, AUC-based safety factors for solriamfetol derived from these 
studies (based on comparison with clinical AUC at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg/day) 
were <1 for mice (based on NOAEL) and <2 for rats and dogs (based on LOAEL), mainly due to exaggerated 
pharmacological effects of solriamfetol on CNS activity.  This information has been included in SmPC section 5.3 
Genotoxicity 
In view of the results obtained the battery of submitted in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, solriamfetol can 
be regarded as being not gentoxic. This information has been included in SmPC section 5.3 
Carcinogenicity 
In the light of negative genotoxicity and no increase of tumour incidence in the long-term mouse and rat 
carcinogenicity studies, [with AUC-based safety margins at the high solriamfetol dose to the MRHD (150 
mg/day) of about 7.8 in mice and about 20.7 in rats], it can be concluded that solriamfetol does not pose a 
carcinogenic risk to humans. This information has been included in SmPC section 5.3 
Compared to controls, cumulative survival rates were (numerically) decreased in solriamfetol-treated  mice, 
maximal at a dose of 65 mg/kg/day (AUC-based safety margin to MRHD about 2.9), with survival rates of 70% 
(controls) versus 48% (p-value 0.0074) for male and 63% (controls) versus 45% (p-value 0.0923) for female 
mice. No decrease in cumulative survival rates was observed in the rat carcinogenicity study. Related 
information has been included in SmPC section 5.3 
In general, the identified causes of premature death in the mouse study were of the types commonly seen in 
studies using mice of the tested strain and age. However, the decreased survival rates in the mid and high dose 
solriamfetol-treated groups appeared to be associated with an increased incidence of premature death of 
undetermined cause (i.e. for which no histologic/macroscopic reason could be identified). 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 38/128 
  
  
 
 
Taking into account that cumulative survival rates were not decreased in rats and that no “classical” 
dose-response relationship was observed in mice, the potential clinical relevance of the mouse findings remains 
unknown.  
Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
For rabbits no TK data are available. Using the HED concept the safety margin for maternal and developmental 
toxicity is <3, when calculated as multiples of the maximum human dose based on mg/m2 body surface area. 
Possible effects on embryofoetal development were investigated in pregnant rats and rabbits. Embryofoetal 
toxicity (increased postimplantation loss in rats, increased incidence of skeletal alterations that included 
sternebrae malalignment in rats and rabbits, hindlimb rotation and bent bones in rats, and decreased foetal 
weights in both species) and situs inversus in rats was only evident in the presence of maternal toxicity 
(decreased body weights). Whether embryotoxicity was a consequence of maternal toxicity or a direct effect of 
solriamfetol cannot be determined. In a distribution study in pregnant rats 14C-solriamfetol was detected in 
foetal membrane (around twice as high as in blood), placenta and whole foetus (nearly similar to blood 
concentration) and thus a direct toxic effect on the foetus cannot be excluded. In rats the exposure margins at 
the maternal and developmental NOAEL are below the human exposure (0.6 – 0.7 based on AUC) at the MRHD, 
while in rabbits the exposure margins at the maternal and developmental NOAEL is < 6 (based on mg/m2 body 
surface area). 
In rats exposure levels (AUC) above 0.6 – 0.7 times the human exposure (AUC) at the MRHD during pregnancy 
and lactation resulted in maternal toxicity and adverse effects on growth and development in the offspring. At 
exposure levels (AUC) 8 to 12 times the human exposure (AUC) at the MRHD no long-term effects on learning 
and memory were observed, but mating and pregnancy indices of the offspring were decreased. 
A respective wording has been included in SmPC section 5.3. 
Due to the insufficient exposure at the NOAELs especially in the prenatal and postnatal development studies in 
rats, which resulted in no safety margins at all, reproductive toxicity should be included as a potential important 
risk in the RMP. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of solriamfetol hydrochloride to the 
environment. The applicant is asked to submit the announced data as soon as possible. 
Other Toxicity Studies 
Immunotoxicity 
According to ICH S8 “Immunotoxicity studies for human pharmaceuticals”, all new human pharmaceuticals 
should be evaluated for the potential to produce immunotoxicity. Therefore, the Applicant was asked to follow a 
weight of evidence approach to discuss whether additional immunotoxicity testing is necessary for solriamfetol  
In his response, the Applicant considered that the immune system findings observed in the general toxicity 
studies were consistent with those caused by (chronic) stress.  
According to the ICH S8 guideline, immunotoxicity is defined as unintended immunosuppression or 
enhancement. It is well known that a chronic “stress” response, e.g. related to a chronic overstimulation of the 
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, can result in immunosuppression and other adverse effects, including 
hypertension. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 39/128 
  
  
 
It has been reported that other CNS stimulating drugs with effects on CNS dopamine and/or norepinephrine 
levels, like e.g. amphetamines or cocaine can result in changes in the activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis and may also have immunosuppressive properties. 
The Applicant pointed out that clinical data concerning effects of solriamfetol on main components of the HPA 
axis (i.e. CRH, vasopressin, ACTH and cortisol plasma levels) are not available. 
Non-clinical data concerning effects of solriamfetol on CRH and ACTH plasma levels are also not available. 
During a three-week toxicity study in male rats (Study JNJ-TOX-6895) with a high dose (450 mg/kg/day) of 
solriamfetol, a (numerical) increase in corticosterone plasma levels (corticosterone is the main glucocorticoid in 
rats) and of vasopressin recovered in urine was observed. 
With regard to potential functional consequences of an activation of the HPA axis, effects of solriamfetol on the 
cardiovascular system (heart rate and blood pressure, as measured in dogs) appeared to be relatively small and 
transient. Concerning the immune system, dose-dependent effects of solriamfetol on numbers of immune cells 
and morphology/weight of immune-system related organs (most prominent in rat studies) were observed. 
Chronic overstimulation of the HPA axis, as observed for other inhibitors of the dopamine and noradrenaline 
reuptake (like cocaine and amphetamines), has been related to an increased mortality rate. In this respect, 
equivocal results have been obtained for solriamfetol in the conducted carcinogenicity studies. While an 
increased mortality rate was observed in (male) mice, no increase was observed in rats (see Discussion on 
Carcinogenicity).  
Overall, the available nonclinical data are not considered sufficient to allow for definite conclusions concerning 
an activation of the HPA axis by solriamfetol. However, taking into account the claimed mechanism of action of 
solriamfetol (inhibition of dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake), they raise sufficient concern to justify a 
critical discussion of this issue and therefore a respective paragraph has been included in Section 5.5: 
“Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects” of this AR. 
Dependence 
With regard to dependence and abuse liability, the CHMP has provided scientific advice in 2017 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/716502/2017). 
According to the information provided by the Applicant, although no formal GLP self-administration (reinforcing 
properties) study was conducted, both non-clinical and clinical data are deemed sufficient to describe the abuse 
potential of solriamfetol.  
Other studies 
On basis of the ICH S10 criteria, solriamfetol is considered to be not sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct 
phototoxicity.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A large battery of nonclinical studies has been submitted for solriamfetol. Overall, the non-clinical data is 
considered sufficient to support Marketing Authorisation for solriamfetol. On basis of these non-clinical data, 
relevant information has been included in SmPC sections 4.6, 5.1 and 5.3.  
The available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of solriamfetol to the environment. 
The applicant is asked to submit the announced data as soon as possible.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Mass balance 
The  absorption,  metabolism,  and  excretion  of  [14C]-R228060  after  a  single  oral  doses  of  200  mg  base 
equivalents of R228060 in four healthy male subjects (41-59 years of age, 76-85 kg, BMI 25-27) were examined 
in single-arm mass balance study R228060-P01-101. 
R228060  was  rapidly  absorbed  from  an  oral  solution,  reaching  maximal  plasma  concentrations  within  30 
minutes.  The  elimination  half-life  was  between  5  and  7  hours  for  both  TR  and  UD.  Key  pharmacokinetic 
parameters 
including  maximum  plasma  concentration  (Cmax),  Tmax,  t1/2  and  area  under  the 
concentration-time curve (AUC)and plasma concentration-time profiles were nearly super-imposable for TR and 
UD, indicating negligible metabolism. 
The urinary route constituted the major route of elimination with a negligible amount of TR recovered in the 
feces. At least 90% of TR was excreted in the urine within the first 48 hours of R228060 administration. As renal 
clearance  represented  the  majority  of  apparent  total  clearance  and  was  greater  than  CrCL,  an  estimate  of 
glomerular filtration rate, it appears that renal secretion is involved in the elimination of R228060 by the kidney. 
Mean (SD) TR recovered in faeces was approximately 0.19% (0.16). 
Single dose administration 
PK data for the characterisation of SD administration of 300 mg and 900 mg (6 x fold supra-therapeutic dose) 
of JZP-110 in healthy volunteers were obtained from study 15-002, principally designed to examine the effects 
of JZP-110 on the QT/QTc interval. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 44/128 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
JZP-110 was rapidly absorbed, with median Tmax of 2 and 3 hours following oral administration of 300 and 900 
mg doses, respectively. An approximately 3-fold greater JZP-110 Cmax (mean: 5290 versus 1774 ng/mL) and 
3.5-fold higher AUC0-inf (mean: 59,190 versus 16,970 ng•h/mL) were observed following the 900 mg dose 
than  following  the  300  mg  dose.  Regressions  between  log-transformed  PK  parameters  and  log-transformed 
dose had slopes close to 1 for Cmax and AUC between 300 and 900 mg doses, confirming dose-proportional PK. 
Food effect study 
Study 15-009 examined the food effect of JZP-110 in 32 healthy adult subjects comparing the PK of JZP-110 
(300 mg SD) under fasting and fed conditions.  
An analysis of variance for PK parameters showed that the 90% confidence intervals of the Geometric Mean 
Ratios  (GMR)  for  both  Cmax  and  AUC0-inf  between  fed  and  fasted  treatments  (fed/fasted)  were  contained 
within the window of 80% to 125% (90% CIs: 89.2-98.8 and 93.8-101.5), respectively. 
Dose proportionality 
Single ascending dose study YUCIC9603-01 in 24 healthy male volunteers examined the PK profile after SD 
administration of eight escalating doses of YKP10A (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 mg). 
Cmax and AUCO-inf for YKP10A have increased in linear dose-dependent fashion over the dose range 50 to 1200 
mg. The compound had moderate dose-independent clearance with a mean terminal half-life of 4.99 to 6.67 
hour. Mean Tmax varied between 1.64 and 2.50 hours, with no apparent relationship to dose. 
Multiple ascending dose study 
In the multiple ascending dose study YUKIC9702-1 the safety, tolerance and PK profile of five dose groups (200 
mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, and 1000 mg as total daily dose [YKP10A as HCl salt]). At each dose level, groups 
of 10 subjects each received an oral dose of either YKP10A (n=8) or placebo (n=2) once every 12 hours for 14 
days. 
Linear  regression  of  Cmax  and  AUC  against  dose  demonstrated  dose-proportional  increases  in  these  2 
parameters. Median Tmax ranged from 1 to 2.5 hours, and mean t½ ranged from 6 to 7.6 hours. 
Special populations 
Renal  impairment  study  15-001  examined  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  of  JZP-110  (as  a  75  mg  SD)  in 
subjects with normal or impaired renal function (mild, moderate, severe), and in subjects with end-stage renal 
disease requiring haemodialysis. 
Solriamfetol t½ and AUC increased and urinary recovery of solriamfetol decreased with increasing levels of renal 
impairment.  Based  on  GMR,  solriamfetol  AUC0-inf  was  higher  by  approximately  53%  (1.53-fold),  129% 
(2.29-fold), and 339% (4.39-fold), and mean t½ increased by approximately 1.2-, 1.9- and 3.9-fold in subjects 
with  mild,  moderate,  or  severe  renal  impairment,  respectively,  compared  with  subjects  with  normal  renal 
function. In general, mean Cmax and median tmax were not substantially affected by renal impairment. 
Based  on  GMRs,  solriamfetol  AUC0-t  was  higher  (approximately  518%  [6.18-fold]  and  357%  [4.57-fold], 
respectively) and Cmax ratios was slightly lower (approximately 3% and 19%, respectively) in End stage renal 
disease  (ESRD)  subjects  without  hemodialysis  and  ESRD  subjects  undergoing  hemodialysis  compared  with 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 45/128 
  
  
 
 
subjects with normal renal function. Mean t½ increased >13-fold in ESRD subjects compared with subjects with 
normal renal function.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
DDI Involving CYP and UGT Enzymes: Five in vitro studies using human microsomes, Supersomes, and primary 
cultured human hepatocyte experimental systems evaluated the potential of solriamfetol to inhibit or induce 
CYP450 or UGT enzyme activity (JNJ-FK4801, JNJ-0796, Covance 8322976, Covance 8322977, and XT165105). 
In  accordance  with  the  SA  received  from  the  CHMP  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/716502/2017)  in  November  2017, 
further investigation of the potential of DDI through CYP2D6 was carried out using other exploratory in silico 
tools such as the mechanistic static model for DDI prediction. In summary, solriamfetol is not a substrate for any 
of the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes and does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 3A4, or UGT1A1 enzymes. CYP 
enzyme inhibition results were uniformly associated with insignificant risk factors using basic or mechanistic 
static models. Taken together, these results show that PK interactions through drug metabolizing enzymes are 
unlikely to occur. 
DDI Involving Transporters: Three in vitro studies were completed to investigate the interaction of solriamfetol 
with  major  membrane  and  renal  transporters  (Covance  8304273;  Covance  8335453;  XT168124).  Overall, 
solriamfetol  appears  to  be  a  low-affinity,  non-selective  substrate  for  multiple  renal  cation  transporters. 
Transporter inhibition results with solriamfetol as the perpetrator were considered insignificant based on the in 
vitro threshold values or based on PBPK modelling. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism(s) of solriamfetol to improve wakefulness in patients with EDS associated with narcolepsy or 
OSA has not been fully characterised. Its efficacy could be mediated through its activity as a dopamine and 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (Baladi et al, 2018). The dysfunction of the dopaminergic and norepinephrine 
pathways originating from the brainstem have been observed in animal models of sleep apnoea and narcolepsy 
(Li et al. 2014; Tsujino et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2015). The wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol is claimed to be 
likely due to activity at dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. The role of dopamine transporters in sleep 
regulation was described in the literature (Wisor et al. 2001) and is supported by the specific dopaminergic 
wake-promoting action of amphetamines and modafinil.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Apart from the human abuse liability study 14-001 (incl. phentermine as positive control, not approved in 
Europe), no active comparator trials were presented in the clinical data package. 
Human abuse liability (HAL) Study 14-001

Assessment report

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the abuse potential of JZP-110 as compared to phentermine 
and placebo in 30 recreational polydrug users with recent histories of stimulant use. 
This  study  involved  three  phases:  a  Screening  Phase,  a  Qualification  Phase,  and  a  Test  Phase.  Eligibility  of 
subjects to proceed to the Qualification Phase was determined in the Screening Phase. 
Eligible subjects entered a 6-day Qualification Phase and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a 
sequence of placebo on Day 1 and phentermine 60 mg on Day 4 or a sequence of phentermine 60 mg on Day 1 
and placebo on Day 4 under double-blind conditions.  
Only subjects who tolerated phentermine and who reported greater liking for phentermine versus placebo (peak 
liking  at  least  15  points  higher  on  a  bipolar  liking-disliking  visual  analog  scale  [VAS],  and  neutral  liking  for 
placebo (within 40 to 60 points on a bipolar liking-disliking VAS) were eligible for the Test Phase of the study. Of 
the  92  subjects  completing  the  Qualification  Phase  about  every  third  (n=33)  did  not  meet  the  qualification 
criteria, i.e did not differentiate between the positive control phentermine and placebo in terms of drug liking. In 
those subjects reporting a difference between phentermine and placebo, peak liking was observed about 2 hours 
post-administration. 
Primary Endpoint 
Drug Liking at the Moment was rated on a 0-100 VAS (strong disliking to strong liking) at multiple time points. 
Peak (Emax) Drug Liking at the Moment across 12 hours was the primary endpoint. 
The HAL study was considered valid since both doses (45 mg and 90 mg) of the positive control, phentermine, 
produced statistically higher ratings than placebo on the primary endpoint, peak (Emax) Liking at the Moment 
(p<0.001).

Table 8: Drug Liking at the Moment VAS Emax Across 12 Hours: Pairwise Comparisons, PP 
Population (N=37) 
For all doses of JZP-110, ratings of Drug Liking at the Moment (VAS Emax) were statistically higher than those 
for placebo (p<0.001).  
QTcF 
Study 15-002 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled, 4-period crossover thorough 
QT study to evaluate the effect of solriamfetol on the QT/QTc intervals in healthy subjects. Each subject received 
single doses of 300 mg solriamfetol, 900 mg solriamfetol, 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control), and placebo 
in separate treatment periods according to a Latin square crossover study design.  
Solriamfetol (300 or 900 mg) did not meet the threshold of ICH E14 for prolongation of QTcF. The upper bounds 
of the 2-sided 90% CIs for the mean difference in least square means for QTcF between the therapeutic (300 
mg) or supratherapeutic (900 mg) doses and placebo were <10 msec at all postdose time points. 
Increases from baseline in HR were observed in the solriamfetol (300 and 900 mg) groups compared with the 
placebo group from 2 (around the time of Cmax) through 12 hours after dosing. The peak increase in mean HR 
from baseline occurred at 6 hours after dosing in the solriamfetol groups (mean change from baseline in HR of 
20.8 and 27.3 bpm in the 300 and 900 mg solriamfetol groups compared with 7.9 bpm in the placebo group). 
Consistent  with  the  increase  in  HR  observed  in  the  solriamfetol  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group, 
treatment-emergent sinus tachycardia (ECG morphological finding) occurred in 6 subjects after receiving 300 
mg solriamfetol and 15 subjects after receiving 900 mg solriamfetol compared with no subjects after receiving 
placebo. 
No clinically significant changes in the mean QRS interval were observed via Holter monitoring. Shortening of 
mean  RR,  PR,  and  QT  intervals  corresponding  to  the  increase  in  HR  were  observed  after  the  solriamfetol 
treatment compared with the placebo treatment.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  results  of  14C  mass  balance  study  R228060-P01-101  in  four  healthy  volunteers  are  indicative  of  high 
gastrointestinal absorption (Ae,u >95% for the unchanged drug). JZP-110 was rapidly and almost completely 
absorbed. More than 96% of TR was excreted in the urine (Ae,u), with negligible amounts of TR recovered in the 
faeces (0.19% Ae,f). Estimated renal clearance of the AS was about 3 times higher than GFR, hence JZP is 
assumed to be actively secreted in the kidney. 
The effect of food on the PK of solriamfetol was explored in Study 15-009 and showed that the Cmax and AUC 
were bioequivalent under fed (after a standardized high-fat, high-calorie meal) and fasted conditions. The Cmax 
was  achieved  about  one  hour  later  under  fed  conditions,  AUC  values  were  about  6%  lower.  Intra-subject 
variability was low, around 10%. The slight differences in plasma levels observed between the fasted vs fed 
state are not considered to be clinically relevant. Hence, JZP-110 fc tablets may be taken with or without meal. 
Ascending multiple dose study YUCIC9702-1 investigated daily doses administered in divided doses twice daily. 
JZP showed overall linear pharmacokinetics at levels of 200 mg to 1000 mg per day. The minimum plasma 
concentration (Cmin) values for the 600 mg, 800 mg, 1000 mg (HCl salt) dose groups after twelve days of twice 
daily  administration  were  slightly  increasing,  which  could  not  be  explained.  This  is  considered  of  minor 
relevance, since the effect was observed for supra-therapeutic doses only. Based on the plot of Cmin values, 
steady state appeared to be achieved by the third day. For the twice daily dosing schedule the accumulation 
ratio was 1.43, indicating 43% accumulation at steady state compared with the first day. Given the apparent 
elimination half-life of about 7 hours and the proposed 24 hours dosing interval, accumulation is of no concern 
in the present case. 
After  the  high  portion  of  renal  elimination  was  shown  in  the  mass  balance  study,  a  comprehensive  study 
(15-001) examining the effect of renal impairment was conducted after 75 mg SD administration. AUC0-inf 
values increased with increasing degree of renal impairment (1.53-fold-, 2.29-fold-, and 4.39-fold in subjects 
with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as compared with healthy control). In parallel, elimination of 
JZP-110  slows  down.  Mean  t½  increased  by  approximately  1.2-,  1.9-  and  3.9-fold  in  subjects  with  mild, 
moderate and severely impaired renal function. Cmax values are only slightly affected by renal function. 
In  end-stage  renal  disease  patients,  AUC0-t  values  are  6.18-fold  increased  (without  haemodialysis),  resp. 
4.57-fold higher in subjects undergoing haemodialysis. In these patients, elimination of JZP-110 is markedly 
slowed  down  (t1/2  values  >  13-fold  increased).  Comparing  plasma  levels  of  ESRD  subjects  with  or  without 
haemodialysis,  it  can  be  concluded  that  haemodialysis  does  not  largely  impact  on  solriamfetol’s  elimination 
profile  after  75  mg  single  dose  administration.  The  dosing  recommendations  as  proposed  in  the  SmPC  are 
considered  to  take  due  account  of  the  results  of  study  15-001.  For  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment 
(creatinine clearance of 15-29 mL/min) the recommended starting dose is 37.5 mg once daily. The 37.5 mg 
dose can be achieved by splitting the scored 75 mg tablet into equal halves. 
Solriamfetol is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine (≥ 95%), with minimal hepatic metabolism: ≤1% of 
dose was recovered in urine as the minor inactive metabolite N-acetyl solriamfetol. In view of the low level of 
hepatic metabolism and the high level of urinary elimination as unchanged drug, a PK study in hepatically 
impaired subjects is not required. 
Results from in vitro studies and subsequent mechanistic static and PBPK modelling indicate that solriamfetol is 
unlikely  to  be  an  inhibitor  or  inducer  of  any  of  the  major  drug  metabolizing  enzymes  or  inhibitor  of  drug 
transporters. Furthermore, solriamfetol is not a substrate for P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or 
MATE2-K.

Moreover, in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the potential of solriamfetol to be a substrate of 
OCT2  and  MATE1  transporters.  Results  seem  to  indicate  that  solriamfetol  may  be  a  substrate  of  OCT2  and 
MATE1 transporters as its uptake was reduced by the presence of inhibitors (quinidine and cimetidine). The 
same result on OCT2 has been observed in CHO cells.  
Study results indicate that solriamfetol is a low-affinity non-selective substrate of multiple cationic renal drug 
transporters,  and  most  likely  undergoes  active  renal  tubular  secretion  by  multiple  transporters  working  in 
concert. Given the lack of substrate specificity to particular transporters, an increase or decrease in the activity 
of any given transporter is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of solriamfetol. 
Abuse liability 
In Human Abuse Liability (HAL) study 14-001 JZP doses of 300 mg, 600 mg and 1200 mg were tested. In terms 
of the primary endpoint “Drug Liking at the Moment” all three JZP doses achieved highly significant higher sores 
than placebo. If compared with the positive control phentermine (a central stimulant and indirect-acting 
sympathomimetic with actions similar to those of dexamphetamine, not approved in Europe) the score was 
equal for both substances, if administered at the highest dose each (phentermine 90 mg, JZP 1200 mg). An 
abuse potential similar or lower as compared to phentermine can be concluded.  
QTcF 
The effect of solriamfetol on the QT/QTcF interval was investigated in a single-center, randomized placebo and 
positive controlled double-blind, 4-period crossover thorough QT study in 60 healthy subjects (Study 15-002). 
Solriamfetol (300 or 900 mg) did not meet the threshold of ICH E14 for prolongation of QTcF. The upper bounds 
of the 2-sided 90% CIs for the mean difference in least square means for QTcF between the therapeutic (300 
mg) or supra-therapeutic (900 mg) doses and placebo were < 10 msec at all post-dose time points. No subject 
had a maximum post-dose QTcF interval > 480 milliseconds or an increase in QTcF  > 60 milliseconds from 
baseline  following  any  treatment.  These  findings  were  also  supported  in  the  12-week  randomized, 
placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with narcolepsy or OSA, where solriamfetol at doses up to 300 mg 
did not have an effect on QTcF prolongation. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Solriamfetol is proposed to be administered in single daily doses of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg. The 75 mg 
tablet contains a scoring line and can be halved to enable 37.5 mg dose administration in subjects with OSA 
and/or renal impairment. Dose proportionality was shown across the therapeutic range. The tablet can be taken 
irrespective of meals. More than 95% of the drug substance was found unchanged in the urine. Therefore, renal 
function plays a crucial role. The influence of various degrees of renal impairment (incl. haemodialysis) was 
adequately characterized.  
Based on the presented in vitro data as well as mechanistic static and PBPK modeling, PK interactions through 
drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, or urinary pH modulators are unlikely to occur in patients taking 
solriamfetol. 
At  a  supra-therapeutic  dose  of  900  mg  (6  times  the  maximum  recommended  dosage),  solriamfetol  did  not 
prolong the QTcF interval to a clinically relevant extent.

As  could  be  expected  from  the  molecular  mode  of  action,  liability  for  abuse  of  solriamfetol  was  shown  in 
recreational  drug  users  at  about  the  same  level  as  phentermine,  a  stimulant,  indirect  sympathomimetic 
substance.  
The clinical pharmacology characterization of solriamfetol is considered acceptable.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
ADX-N05 201 as proof of concept study 
Phase IIa study ADX-N05 201 was conducted in narcolepsy patients to provide proof of concept and inform the 
design of subsequent phase III studies in the target population. This was a 4-week (28 days), double-blind, 
placebo-controlled,  multicentre,  randomized,  cross-over  study  of  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  ADX-N05  in  the 
treatment  of  EDS  in  adult  subjects  (18  to  65  years)  with  narcolepsy  as  defined  by  ICSD-2.  Subjects  were 
assigned to two treatment sequences (Sequence #1: 1st and 2nd wk placebo, 3rd wk 150 mg, 4th wk 300 mg; 
Sequence #2: 1st wk 150 mg, 2nd wk 300 mg, 3rd and 4th week placebo). No dose finding study for the use of 
solriamfetol in the treatment of EDS was conducted.  
Given the limitations of a randomized, cross-over design with subjects acting as their own control, small-scale 
study ADX-N05 201 is not further discussed here. Nonetheless, early proof of concept study ADX-N05-201 is 
considered to provide useful information for consecutive phase III studies in terms of endpoints (Maintenance of 
Wakefulness Test (MWT), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Clinical Global Impressions - Change (CGIc), study 
population and doses.  
ADX-N05-202 as phase IIb study 
This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group study was designed to 
evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  solriamfetol  for  the  treatment  of  EDS  in  adult  subjects  with  narcolepsy 
(ICSD-2). Eligible subjects had a baseline mean sleep latency of < 10 minutes on the MWT, and a baseline score 
of ≥ 10 on the ESS. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of solriamfetol, administered 
once-daily in a dose range of 150 to 300 mg, compared with placebo in the treatment of ES. Subjects were 
randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (Group #1: Weeks 1-4: ADX-N05 150 mg/day; Weeks 5-12: 
ADX-N05 300 mg/day; Group #2: Weeks 1-12: Placebo). 
The significance of phase II study ADX-N05-202 is given by the fact that it provides the first parallel group, 
placebo controlled data for solriamfetol in narcolepsy patients although subjects in the active arm underwent 
forced dose increase. Therefore, phase IIb study ADX-N05-202 does not provide dose finding data in the literal 
sense. Fixed dose arms were not compared following a parallel group design. Instead, subjects allocated to the 
ADX arm received 150 mg ADX o.d. for the first four weeks of treatment and dosing then was increased to 300 
mg  o.d.  for  the  following  eight  weeks.  The  ADX  arm  was  compared  with  placebo.  For  the  main  efficacy 
parameters (MWT, CGI-C, and ESS) efficacy increased over time when the scores of the 4-wk visit are compared 
with  the  last  assessment  after  12  weeks.  Superiority  over  placebo  could  be  shown  for  all  three  efficacy 
endpoints.  Therefore,  study  ADX-N05  202  justifies  to  further  explore  the  150 mg  resp.  300  mg  o.d.  dosing 
regimen over a 12-week treatment period in narcoleptic patients.

2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Two  pivotal  phase  III  studies,  essentially  similar  in  design  (fixed  dose  arms)/  duration  /  endpoints,  were 
conducted, one in narcolepsy and one in OSA.  
14-002; A 12-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group study of solriamfetol 75, 150, and 300 mg vs. placebo in subjects with narcolepsy. 
Study Participants  
Male or female between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive. 
Study 14-002 (Narcolepsy) 
Each subject had to meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: 
1.  Diagnosis of narcolepsy according to ICSD-3 or DSM-5. 
2.  Baseline mean sleep latency <25 minutes as documented by the mean of the first 4 trials of the Baseline 
5-trial MWT. 
3.  Baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score ≥10. 
4.  Usual nightly total sleep time of at least 6 hours. 
Subjects were excluded if presenting with  
1.  Moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnoea on the baseline PSG  
2.  Daily caffeine use at the Screening Phase >600 mg/day of caffeine or >6 cups of coffee/day 
3.  History or presence of any clinically significant or unstable medical condition, behavioural or psychiatric 
disorder  (including  suicidal  ideation  and  excluding  mild  or  moderate  substance  use  disorders),  or 
surgical history that could affect the safety of the subject or interfere with study assessments per the 
judgment of the investigator 
4.  Presence or history of significant cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction, hypertension 
(defined as consistent systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or consistent diastolic blood pressure ≥90 
mmHg), angina pectoris, clinically significant arrhythmias, clinically significant valvular heart disease, 
history  of  any  revascularization  procedures  or  second-  or  third-degree  heart  block  with/without  a 
pacemaker, or heart failure 
Patients were required to discontinue the use of psychostimulants prior to starting on the study drug (washout 
period of at least 5 half-lives of the drug) for at least 7 days prior to baseline assessment. Concomitant use of 
psychostimulants was prohibited during the study 
Treatments 
The  main  studies  are  placebo-controlled.  JZP-110  37.5  mg  (in  study  14-003),  75,  150,  and  300  mg  was 
administered QD, by mouth as 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 mg tablets (based on the free base of the molecule) that 
were over-encapsulated in an opaque gelatin capsule. The 37.5 mg tablet used in study 14-003 is not part of the 
present MAA. Instead, the 75 mg tablet contains a score line and can be divided into equal doses.

Subjects were instructed to take their daily dose of study drug in the morning on an empty stomach within 1 
hour of awakening, and to abstain from eating or drinking (except for water) for 30 minutes after taking the 
study drug. If a subject failed to take the study drug within an hour of awakening, the subject was instructed to 
take the drug at least 12 hours before bedtime. If this was not possible, the subject was instructed not to take 
study drug for that day. 
Objectives/Outcomes/endpoints 
In both pivotal studies the identical set of efficacy co-primary and secondary endpoints was chosen: 
Co-primary Efficacy Endpoints: 
•  MWT: Change in the mean sleep latency time (in minutes) as determined from the first 4 trials of a 
40-minute MWT from Baseline to Week 12 
•  ESS: Change in ESS score from Baseline to Week 12 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: 
•  PGIc: Percentage of subjects reported as improved (minimally, much, or very much) on the PGIc at 
Week 12 
Post-hoc analyses 
Based on feedback from the CHMP, the applicant conducted the following post-hoc efficacy analyses of the data 
from the individual studies. 
•  Post-hoc sensitivity analyses of the results for the PGIc in which improvement was defined using only 
the categories of “much improved” and “very much improved” (for the 12-week Phase 3 Study 14-002 
and Study 14-003) or “much worsened” and “very much worsened” (for Phase 3 randomized withdrawal 
for Study 14-004 and Study 14-005). 
•  Post-hoc correlation analyses for PGIc and ESS in the 12-week Phase 3 studies to evaluate whether the 
effect observed on the PGIc is related to the effect on excessive sleepiness. 
•  Post-hoc analyses of ESS in the 12-week Phase 3 studies to evaluate the percentage of subjects with 
ESS values below 10 and with their percentage change from baseline. 
Randomization 
Stratified randomization on the basis of the presence or absence of cataplexy was used to assign subjects in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio to receive JZP-110 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo over the 12-week Treatment phase.  
Blinding 
A  double-blind  approach  was  used  during  the  Treatment  Phase.  All  study  drugs  were  prepared  in  identical 
opaque  gelatin  capsules  to  ensure  adequate  blinding,  and  all  study  personnel  were  blinded  to  the  study 
treatments

Statistical methods 
The  modified  Intent-to-Treat  (mITT)  Population  was  used  to  evaluate  the  co-primary  endpoints  and  other 
efficacy endpoints (unless otherwise indicated). It consisted of subjects who received at least one dose of study 
medication and had baseline and at least one post-baseline evaluation of MWT or ESS. If a subject in the mITT 
Population did not have an assessment for a particular secondary efficacy endpoint, that subject was excluded 
from the analysis of that endpoint. 
Efficacy analyses were performed for the mITT Analysis Population. For the analysis of the co-primary efficacy 
endpoints, a mixed-effect repeated measures (MMRM) model was used as the primary method of analysis. This 
model  includes  factors  for  treatment,  time  as  a  discrete  factor,  treatment-by-time  interaction,  the  baseline 
value of the endpoint and the stratification factor (presence or absence of cataplexy for 14-002 and subjects’ 
compliant or noncompliant use of their primary OSA therapy for 14-003) used for randomisation. All available 
data was included in the model. 
In addition to the MMRM model, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to analyse MWT and ESS 
to  provide  sensitivity  analyses.  This  ANCOVA  model  includes  the  effect  for  treatment  as  a  fixed  effect  and 
baseline  value  of  the  efficacy  endpoint  as  the  covariate.  The  chi-squared  test  was  used  to  test  hypotheses 
associated with the analysis of the key secondary efficacy endpoint of PGIc and the secondary efficacy endpoint 
of CGIc at Week 12. For the analysis of the co-primary efficacy parameters of MWT and the total ESS score, 
missing data was handled by the MMRM methods for the primary analysis.  
For sensitivity analyses, the following missing data approaches were used to impute the missing data to assess 
the  potential  impact  of  missing  data:  two  single  imputation  (SI)  approaches  using  last  observation  carried 
forward  (LOCF)  and  mean  imputation,  and  two  multiple  imputation  (MI)  approaches,  using  a  Markov  Chain 
Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  method  with  regression  and  a  Pattern  Mixture  Model  approach  with  different  dropout 
patterns. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 364 screened subjects, 125 failed screening. The primary reasons for screen failure were failing to meet 
inclusion criteria (50.4%) or meeting exclusion criteria (26.4%). 
The remaining 239 subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg 
JZP-110.  Of  these,  236  subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication  and  comprised  the  Safety 
Population; the remaining 3 subjects were randomized in error (did not receive study medication) and were 
excluded from the Safety Population. 
The majority of subjects completed the study, 88.1% in the placebo group, and 83.1%, 86.4%, and 72.9% in 
the 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg JZP-110 groups, respectively. 
The most frequent reasons for withdrawal from the study were lack of efficacy and AEs. Withdrawal due to lack 
of  efficacy  in  the  placebo,  75  mg,  150  mg,  and  300  mg  JZP-110  dose  groups  was  1.7%,  6.8%,  1.7%,  and 
10.2%, respectively, and withdrawal due to AEs was 1.7%, 3.4%, 6.8%, and 8.5%, respectively.

Baseline data 
As concerns baseline demographics, about two thirds of recruited subjects were female (67.2% in interventional 
arms  and  59.3%  in  Placebo  arm).  The  mean  age  of  included  subjects  was  around  36  years  (range  18-70) 
reflecting  the  predominantly  young  target  population.  Baseline  MWT  sleep  latency  times  and  baseline  ESS 
scores were similar across treatment groups. Approximately 50% of subjects across all treatment groups had a 
medical history of cataplexy, reflecting the presence or absence of cataplexy used as a stratification factor for 
the study. Baseline CGIs evaluation categorized most subjects in each treatment group as markedly ill, with a 
similar percentage of subjects across all groups classified as moderately or severely ill. 
The  majority 
of 
subjects 
received 
concomitant  medications 
during 
the 
study 
being 
anti-inflammatory/antirheumatic products the most frequently reported. The use of antihistamines for systemic 
usage (placebo: 8.5% and JZP-110 15.3 %) and antidepressants (placebo: 8.5% and JZP-110 12.4 %) was also 
reported  during  the  study  conduction.  Around  25%  of  subjects  presented  with  a  history  of  depression. The 
portion of included subjects with mild OSAS was similar across dose arms: 9/59 (15.3%) in the placebo arm, 
11/59 (18.6%) for 75 mg, 15/59 (25.4%) for 150 mg and 7/59 (11.9%) in the 300 mg arm.

Outcomes and estimation 
Co-primary and key secondary endpoints 
Subjects who received solriamfetol demonstrated improvement in wakefulness, as measured on the MWT, and 
a reduction in EDS based on ESS scores (co-primary endpoints). At Week 12, subjects randomized to 150 mg 
and 300 mg of solriamfetol demonstrated a statistically significant improvement based on the MWT, ESS, and 
PGIc compared with placebo. Subjects randomized to 75 mg showed statistically significant improvement on the 
ESS but not on the MWT or PGIc (Please refer to tabulated summary of efficacy results). 
The magnitude of effect was dose-dependent, was observed by Week 1, and was maintained over the 12 weeks 
of treatment on both the MWT and ESS.

Figure 2: 14-002 Study: MWT and ESS Change from Baseline by Study Visit (Week) in Subjects with 
Narcolepsy 
Sensitivity analyses: Co-primary endpoints 
Four sensitivity analyses of the co-primary endpoints of change from baseline to Week 12 in MWT mean sleep 
latency and ESS scores were performed.  
Sensitivity analysis 1 and sensitivity analysis 2 utilized an ANCOVA model, with change from baseline as the 
response variable, and fixed-effect model terms of treatment, baseline, and randomization stratification factor 
(presence or absence of cataplexy). Missing data was imputed using an LOCF approach in sensitivity analysis 1 
and the corresponding treatment group mean in sensitivity analysis 2.  
Sensitivity analysis 3 utilized an MMRM, with change from baseline as the response variable and fixed-effect of 
treatment,  visit,  treatment  by  visit,  randomization  stratification  factor  (presence  or  absence  of  cataplexy), 
covariate of baseline, and unstructured variance-covariance structure. Missing data was imputed using multiple 
imputation  method  by  MCMC  for  non-monotone  missing  and  regression  method  for  monotone  missing  data 
within each treatment group. 
The  results  of  sensitivity  analyses  1,  2,  and  3  were  generally  consistent  with  and  supported  the  primary 
analyses, with a statistically significant increase relative to placebo observed at the 300 and 150 mg JZP-110 
doses but not at the 75 mg JZP-110 for change in MWT mean sleep latency at Week 12. An exception was at the 
75 mg JZP-110 dose in sensitivity analysis 2, in which statistical significance compared with placebo for MWT 
mean  sleep  latency  was  observed  (p  =  0.0413).  In  all  3  sensitivity  analyses,  a  statistically  significant 
improvement compared with placebo was observed for change in ESS score at Week 12 at the 75, 150, and 300 
mg JZP-110 doses.

Table 11: Summary of Sensitivity Analyses of Change in MWT Mean Sleep Latency and ESS Total 
Score from Baseline to Week 12 (mITT Population) 
For sensitivity analysis 4, the robustness of the JZP-110 response for improving wakefulness as measured by 
MWT mean sleep latency and ESS score was evaluated using the missing not at random method and applying 
progressively more stringent analysis criteria by subtracting an increasingly greater percentage of the treatment 
effect (K) which accounted for dropouts due to AE, lack of efficacy (LOE), and AE and LOE. For the change in 
MWT mean sleep latency, for all adjustments for treatment effect, treatment differences in the response and 
significance compared with placebo were maintained for the 150 and 300 mg JZP-110 groups. For ESS score, 
treatment  differences  in  the  response  and  significance  compared  with  placebo  were  maintained  after  all 
adjustments for the 75, 150, and 300 mg JZP-110 dose groups. 
Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc): Percentage of Subjects Improved 
Numerical increases in the percentage of subjects with improvement from baseline on the CGIc at Weeks 1, 4, 
8,  and  12  were  observed  in  the  placebo  group  and  in  JZP-110  dose  groups.  At  Week  12,  subjects  in  all  4 
treatment groups were improved on the CGIc, with 41.4% (less than half) of subjects in the placebo group 
reported to have overall improvement on the CGIc compared with 69.5%, 83.6%, and 83.1% in the 75, 150, 
and 300 mg JZP-110 groups, respectively. At Week 12, percentage differences of 28.1% (p = 0.0022), 42.3% 
(p  <0.0001),  and  41.7%  (p  <0.0001)  were  observed  for  the  75,  150,  and  300  mg  JZP-110  dose  groups, 
respectively. 
Post-hoc analysis 
Magnitude of change on ESS 
Additional  post-hoc  analyses  evaluated  the  magnitude  of  change  on  the  ESS  to  estimate  the  percentage  of 
subjects with an ESS score ≤10 and the percentage of subjects with at least a 25% decrease from baseline in ESS 
score. At Week 12, results showed that treatment with solriamfetol increased the percentage of subjects who 
had an ESS score ≤ 10 in a dose-dependent manner; 15.5% of the subjects in the placebo group had an ESS 
score ≤ 10 vs. 30.5%, 40.0%, and 49.2% of subjects in the 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg solriamfetol groups, 
respectively.

Examples  of  excluded  medications  included  OTC  sleep  aids  or  stimulants  (e.g.,  pseudoephedrine), 
methylphenidate,  amphetamines,  modafinil,  armodafinil,  sodium  oxybate,  pemoline,  trazodone, 
hypnotics, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and opioids. Medications were to be discontinued such that 
the subject returned to his/her baseline level of daytime sleepiness at least 7 days prior to the Baseline 
visit, in the opinion of the Investigator. 
3.  History or presence of bipolar disorder, bipolar related disorders, schizophrenia, schizophrenia spectrum 
disorders, or other psychotic disorders according to DSM-5 criteria. 
4.  History  or  presence  of  any  acutely  unstable  medical  condition,  behavioural  or  psychiatric  disorder 
(including suicidal ideation). 
5.  Presence of significant cardiovascular disease including but not limited to: myocardial infarction within 
the  past  year,  unstable  angina  pectoris,  symptomatic  congestive  heart  failure  (American  College  of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association stage C or D), revascularization procedures within the past year, 
ventricular cardiac arrhythmias requiring an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) or 
medication therapy, uncontrolled hypertension, systolic blood pressure ≥155 mmHg or diastolic blood 
pressure  ≥95  mmHg  (at  screening,  or  consistently  across  Baseline  measures  according  to  protocol 
specifications), or any history of cardiovascular disease or any significant cardiovascular condition that 
in the investigator’s opinion could jeopardize subject safety in the study. 
Treatments; Outcomes/endpoints 
The treatments, endpoints and statistical analyses were the same as for study 14-002. Stratification factor was 
different for 14-003.  
Randomization 
Stratified randomization on the basis of subjects’ compliant or noncompliant use of their primary OSA therapy 
was used to assign subjects in a 1:1:2:2:2 ratio to receive JZP-110 37.5, 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo over the 
12-week Treatment phase.  
Blinding 
A  double-blind  approach  was  used  during  the  Treatment  Phase.  All  study  drugs  were  prepared  in  identical 
opaque  gelatin  capsules  to  ensure  adequate  blinding,  and  all  study  personnel  were  blinded  to  the  study 
treatments

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 476 subjects were enrolled in the study and were randomized to receive 37.5, 75, 150, or 300 mg 
JZP-110 or placebo in a 1:1:2:2:2 ratio. Of these, 474 subjects received at least 1 dose of study medication and 
comprised the Safety Population; the majority of subjects randomized to receive placebo (84.9%) or a dose of 
JZP-110 (85.4%) completed the study. 
Reasons for subject withdrawal from the study for the placebo group included: “other” (5.0%), adverse event 
(3.4%), withdrawal of consent (3.4%), and noncompliance with treatment (1.7%). For subjects randomized to 
a dose of JZP-110, reasons for subject withdrawal from study included: adverse event (7.3%), “other” (3.1%), 
withdrawal  of  consent  (2.5%),  lost  to  follow-up  (0.8%),  protocol  violation  (0.6%),  and  noncompliance  with 
treatment (0.3%). Overall, a greater number and percentage of subjects in the 300 mg JZP-110 group (13.6%) 
relative to all other treatment groups did not complete the study due to 1 or more adverse events. 
Baseline data 
As concerns baseline demographics, about two thirds of recruited subjects were male (62.0% in interventional 
arms and 64.7% in Placebo arm) and the mean age of included subjects was between 52.7 to 57.1 years (range 
20-75). Regarding BMI as a measure of obesity status, the mean BMI of recruited subjects ranged from 32.92 
to 34.07 kg/m2 across treatment arms. The portion of subjects compliant with primary OSA therapy is consistent 
across treatment arms (68.4-72.9% across treatment arms, 70.5% of overall safety population). Baseline CGIs 
evaluation categorized most subjects as moderately (~40%) or markedly ill (~30%). Overall, baseline disease 
characteristics  were  balanced  between  placebo  and  JZP-110  dose  groups  both  in  terms  of  disease  severity 
(CGI-S, MWT, ESS) and primary OSA therapy use. Other co-morbidities related to OSA reported for at least 10% 
of patients included hypertension (48.7%), hyperlipidaemia (47.9%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (26.8%), 
diabetes mellitus (29.6%), depression (23.1%), obesity (12.7%), and anxiety (11.8%).

Note: Percentages are based on N, number of subjects within each treatment group. 
Mean sleep latency is the average sleep latency of the first 4 trials, or 3 of the first 4 trials if 1was missing. Higher 
scores indicate greater ability to stay awake. 
ESS Total Score was defined as the sum of 8 item scores, if 6 or more of them were nonmissing. If 1 or 2 ESS 
items were missing at specific time point, the mean of the remaining 7 or 6 nonmissing ESS items at that time 
point was used to impute the missing ESS items. Higher scores indicate greater chance of dozing.

Outcomes and estimation 
Co-primary and key secondary endpoints 
Subjects who received solriamfetol demonstrated improvement in wakefulness, as measured by the MWT, and 
a reduction in EDS based on ESS scores (co-primary endpoints). At Week 12, subjects randomized to 75 mg, 
150 mg, and 300 mg of solriamfetol demonstrated statistically significant improvement on the MWT, ESS, and 
PGIc  scores  compared  with  placebo.  Subjects  randomized  to  37.5  mg  solriamfetol  showed  significant 
improvement based on the MWT and ESS, but not on the PGIc. (Please refer to tabulated summary of efficacy 
results). 
The  magnitude  of  effect  was  dose-dependent,  observed  by  Week  1,  and  maintained  over  the  12  weeks  of 
treatment on both the MWT and ESS.

Figure 4: 14-003 Study: MWT and ESS Change from Baseline by Study Visit (Week) in Subjects with 
OSA 
Sensitivity analyses: Co-primary endpoints 
The same set of sensitivity analyses as already undertaken for study 14-002 was also used in study 14-003. The 
results  of  sensitivity  analyses  1,  2,  and  3  were  consistent  with  and  supported  the  primary  analyses,  with 
increases observed from Baseline to Week 12 in MWT mean sleep latency (in minutes) and reductions in mean 
ESS Score for all JZP-110 dose groups compared with placebo. 
Sensitivity analysis 4 assessed the robustness of the JZP-110 response for improving wakefulness as measured 
by the MWT mean sleep latency and mean ESS score using the missing not at random method and applying 
progressively more stringent analysis criteria by subtracting an increasingly greater percentage of the treatment 
effect (K) which accounted for dropouts due to AEs, lack of efficacy (LOE), and AEs or LOE. For the change in 
MWT  mean  sleep  latency  and  for  mean  ESS  score,  treatment  differences  in  the  response  were  maintained 
compared with placebo after all adjustments were made for all 4 JZP-110 dose groups 
Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc): Percentage of Subjects Improved 
Consistent dose-related increases in the percentage of subjects with overall improvement on the CGIc were 
observed  with  JZP-110  treatment.  At  Week  12,  approximately  one  half  of  placebo  subjects  (49.1%)  were 
reported  to  have  an  overall  improvement  in  their  condition,  whereas  58.9%, 70.7%,  90.5%,  and  88.7%  of 
subjects in each of the 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 mg JZP-110 dose groups, respectively, were reported with overall 
improvement on the CGIc. 
Percentage differences relative to placebo of 9.8% (p=0.2289), 21.6% (p=0.0070), 41.4% (p<0.0001), and 
39.6% (p<0.0001) were observed for each of the 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 mg JZP-110 dose groups, respectively.

At Week 12, treatment with solriamfetol increased the percentage of subjects who reached an ESS score <10 in 
a  dose-dependent  manner  (ie,  37.7%  of  the  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  vs.  51.8%,  55.2%,  70.7%,  and 
73.0% of subjects in the 37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg solriamfetol groups, respectively.

Of note, at Week 12 the mean ESS scores across all solriamfetol dose groups (37.5 mg: 9.7, 75 mg: 10.0, 150 
mg: 7.5, 300 mg: 7.1) decreased to the commonly accepted definition of normal sleepiness (ie, ESS scores ≤ 10; 
Johns and Hocking, 1997).

Supportive studies 
Apart  from  the  two  12-week  phase  III  studies  14-002  and  14-003,  data  on  randomized  withdrawal  are 
additionally  obtained  from  phase  III,  6-week  randomized  withdrawal  study  14-004  in  OSA  patients  and 
long-term  extension  study  14-005,  which  recruited  combined  narcolepsy  and  OSA  patient  populations  from 
previous phase II and phase III studies.  
Study 14-004 
Study 14-004 was a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal study of the safety and 
efficacy of solriamfetol for the treatment of EDS in adult subjects with OSA. A total of 174 subjects were enrolled 
at 34 study centres (25 in the United States and 9 in Europe).  
The  study  comprised  a  Screening,  Titration,  Stable-dose,  Double-bind  Withdrawal,  and  a  Safety  Follow-up 
Phase. After completion of Screening, subjects entered the 2-week open-label Titration Phase. Dosing started at 
75 mg once daily and was titrated up 1 dose level every 3 days to 150 mg/day or a maximum dose of 300 
mg/day.  Subjects  could  also  titrate  down  to  75  mg  or  150  mg  at  any  time  following  consultation  with 
investigative site staff. Subjects who were titrated to an efficacious and tolerable dose in the Titration Phase 
then entered the 2-week open-label Stable-dose Phase and remained on the same dose regimen. 
At Week 4, subjects, who reported “much” or “very much” improvement on the PGIc and showed a numerical 
improvement in MWT and ESS from the beginning of titration, were entered into the Double-blind Withdrawal 
Phase and were randomized to continue solriamfetol at the dose received in the Stable-dose Phase or to receive 
placebo for 2 weeks.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the study were change in the mean sleep latency time (MWT, in minutes) 
and  ESS  as  determined  from  the  end  of  the  Stable-Dose  phase  (Week  4)  to  the  end  of  the  Double-Blind 
Withdrawal phase (Week 6).

During the Double-Blind Withdrawal Phase (from wk 4 to wk 6), subjects who continued to receive JZP-110 
remained improved on the MWT, whereas subjects who were switched to placebo worsened. The difference was 
statistically significant in favor of the active treatment group (p<0.0001). 
At Week 6 the mean ESS score (SE) increased by 4.5 (0.71) for the Placebo group, compared with a mean 
decrease  of  -0.1  (0.73)  for  those  who  stayed  on  JZP-110,  resulting  in  a  statistically  significant  LS  mean 
difference of -4.6 (95% CI: -6.4, -2.8) in favor of the JZP-110 group (p<0.0001).

Study 14-005 
This was a long-term phase III study of JZP-110 combining narcoleptic and OSA subjects who had completed 
Study 14-002, 14-003, 14-004, 15-004, 15-005, ADX-N05 201, or ADX-N05 202. The objectives of this study 
were 2-fold, i.e. to assess the maintenance of efficacy of JZP-110 during the double-blind, placebo-controlled 
portion of the study and to assess the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy of JZP-110.  
Subjects  from  the  12-week  Studies  14-002  and  14-003  rolled  directly  into  this  study  on  completion  of  the 
previous study and were designated Group A. As these subjects already had 12 weeks of treatment, and had no 
disruption  in  treatment,  their  duration  on  this  study  was  approximately  40  weeks  to  obtain  52  weeks  of 
treatment. Subjects from the other studies did not roll directly over from prior studies were designated Group B; 
their duration on this study was approximately 52 weeks. 
During the maintenance phase, a 2-week randomized withdrawal period was conducted, from Weeks 27 to 29 
for  Group  A  and  from  Weeks  26  to  28  for  Group  B.  At  the  beginning  of  the  randomized  withdrawal  period, 
subjects were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to continue to receive JZP-110 at the dose they were currently receiving or 
to receive placebo for 2 weeks. At the end of that period, subjects who had received placebo resumed treatment

with 75 mg of JZP-110. Subjects who had been receiving the 150 mg/day received 75 mg/day for the first 3 
days, followed by 150 mg/day thereafter. Subjects who had been receiving 300 mg/day received 150 mg/day 
for the first 3 days, followed by 300 mg/day thereafter. 
The majority of subjects in the Safety Population were enrolled after completing either Study 14-003 (n = 333) 
or Study14-002 (n = 186). Hence, majority of subjects treated in this study were in Group A (521 enrolled and 
519 treated of 645). Fewer than 100 subjects were enrolled from each of the other parent studies. 
Primary efficacy endpoint was the change in ESS score from the beginning to the end of the 2-week randomized 
withdrawal period. 
At the beginning of the randomized withdrawal period (ie, efficacy baseline), mean ESS scores were similar for 
both  the  placebo  and  JZP-110  groups  (7.8  vs.  7.3,  respectively).  At  the  end  of  the  2-week  randomized 
withdrawal period, the placebo group had a greater mean ESS score than the JZP-110 group (12.6 vs. 8.5, 
respectively),  which  indicated  greater  sleepiness  in  the  placebo  group.  The  resulting  LS  mean  difference 
(JZP-110 - placebo) of -3.7 was statistically significant (p <0.0001). Similar results were seen both for subjects 
with OSA and subjects with narcolepsy. 
Figure 8: ESS Score over Time (± SD) in the Open-label period Overall and by Indication, Safety 
Population 
In the overall Safety Population, mean ESS scores were 15.9 for both Group A and Group B at baseline of the 
parent or current study, respectively. At Week 2, mean ESS scores were 7.6 for Group A and 7.8 for Group B, 
and this improvement (ie, decrease in mean ESS scores) was maintained for the duration of the study. In the 
overall study population, mean ESS scores for the combined JZP-110 group were below 10 (ie, the threshold for 
normal levels of sleepiness as defined by Johns [1991]) at all visits starting at Week 2 and for the remainder of 
the open-label period. 
Mean values and decreases from baseline for subjects with OSA were similar to those observed for the overall 
study population. Similar to the overall study population, mean ESS scores post baseline were less than 10 for 
subjects with OSA for the combined JZP-110 group.

Subjects  with  narcolepsy  had  higher  ESS  scores  at  baseline  than  subjects  with  OSA.  For  subjects  with 
narcolepsy, the magnitude of change at each post-baseline visit (ie, decrease from baseline to each visit) was 
similar to that observed for the overall patient population and in subjects with OSA. Mean ESS scores generally 
remained below or slightly above 10 post-baseline for subjects with narcolepsy for the combined JZP-110 group. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Target population 
The  narcolepsy  and  OSA  target  population  was  adequately  chosen  based  on  standard  diagnostic  criteria 
(ICSD-3).  The  baseline  requirements  in  terms  of  disease  severity  (ESS  >  10,  representing  higher  normal 
daytime  sleepiness)  were  on  the  low  side,  however,  the  ESS  score  of  actually  recruited  subjects  was 
considerably  higher  (ESS  16.9  to  17.1  in  study  14-002  resp.  ESS  14.8  to  15.6  across  dose  arms  in  study 
14-003). Equally, the inclusion criterion regarding sleep latency (first 4 trials of MWT) at screening was very low, 
i.e. requiring sleep latency < 25 min (14-002) or < 30 min (14-003, 14-004). MWT values higher than 19.4 min 
are considered as normal (healthy) wakefulness (Doghramji et al. 1997). Observed MWT at baseline of 12-13 (in 
OSA,  14-003)  resp.  6-8  (narcolepsy,  14-002),  however,  point  to  more  severe  disease  states  of  study 
participants.  Baseline  assessment  of  disease  severity  (CGI-S)  revealed  that  the  majority  of  subjects  was 
categorized as 5=markedly ill (14-002) resp. 4=moderately ill (14-003). 
The exclusion criteria are acceptable. As regards the CV risk profile of included OSA patients, it is noted that 
there were several exclusion criteria, mainly excluding those with acutely unstable conditions or presence of 
significant  cardiovascular  disease  including  but  not  limited  to:  myocardial  infarction  within  the  past  year, 
unstable  angina  pectoris,  uncontrolled  hypertension,  systolic  blood  pressure  ≥155  mmHg  or  diastolic  blood 
pressure ≥95 mmHg and others. 
Any other medication used to counteract EDS was prohibited throughout the trials and was washed out. The 
mode of action of solriamfetol (claimed selective DA / NE reuptake inhibitor) is typical for antidepressants. The 
exclusion of bipolar disorder resp. schizophrenic patients is therefore justified. The same applies to subjects with 
a history of suicidal ideation. 
Baseline Narcolepsy (14-002) 
Analysis of patients’ baseline characteristics in study 14-002 does not reveal relevant differences across study 
arms.  Disease  severity  in  terms  of  ESS  (16.9  -17.3  min),  MSLT  (6.14  –  8.73  min)  is  in  the  same  order  of 
magnitude  as  compared  to  previous  MAAs  in  narcolepsy  and  demonstrate  an  adequately  chosen  patient 
population. About every second subject presents with cataplectic events.  
As  concerns  baseline  demographics,  about  two  thirds  of  recruited  subjects  were  female  (65.3%),  while 
according to literature reviews there are no differences in rates of narcolepsy among men and women (Bhattarai 
J  et  al.  2017).  The  mean  age  of  included  subjects  was  around  36  years  (range  18-70)  reflecting  the 
predominantly young target population. Although narcolepsy can have an onset at any age, for most individuals, 
narcolepsy symptoms present in the first two decades of life, typically prior to 25. It often remains undiagnosed 
until many years after initial symptom onset (Thorpy MJ et al. 2015). Around 25% of subjects presented with a 
history of depression, a condition which might also be favourably influenced by the treatment with solriamfetol 
due to its pharmacological mode of action. The percentage of subjects with a medical history of depression was 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 75/128 
  
  
 
 
about equal across treatment arms, hence, it is not expected to bias the study outcome. While subjects with 
moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnoea were excluded from study participation, subjects reporting mild 
sleep apnoea syndrome were allowed. The portion of included subjects with mild OSAS was similar across dose 
arms:  9/59  (15.3%)  in  the  placebo  arm,  11/59  (18.6%)  for  75  mg,  15/59  (25.4%)  for  150  mg  and  7/59 
(11.9%)  in  the  300  mg  arm.  A  consistent  dose-dependent  response  was  observed  for  the  co-primary  ESS 
endpoint (change from baseline to wk-12: placebo -1.6, 75 mg -3.8, 150 mg -5.4, 300 mg -6.4). There remains 
a potential that part of the reduction in EDS may reflect improvement of co-morbid mild OSAS. It would have 
been preferable to completely exclude co-morbid OSAS in the narcolepsy study. Although a partial impact of 
co-morbid mild OSAS on the ESS reduction cannot be excluded with certainty, inclusion of a portion of subjects 
with co-morbid OSAS in the narcolepsy study does not principally question validity of obtained results for the 
co-primary ESS endpoint. 
Baseline OSA (14-003) 
Disease severity in terms of ESS (14.8 -15.6 min) and MWT-MSLT (12.00 – 13.64 min) is less pronounced as 
compared  to  the  narcolepsy  population  of  study  14-002.  Recruited  subjects  were  stratified  on  the  basis  of 
compliant or noncompliant use of a primary OSA therapy. Compliant use of a primary OSA therapy was defined 
as PAP use of ≥4 hours per night on ≥70% of nights (≥5 of 7 nights/week), historical report (with investigator 
concurrence) of use of an oral appliance on ≥70% of nights (≥5 of 7 nights/week), or receipt of an effective 
surgical intervention for OSA symptoms. Compliance with primary OSA therapy use, which was allowed to be 
continued throughout the study, was recorded for 70.5% (334/474) of OSA patients. 
About two thirds of recruited subjects were male (62.7%). The mean age of included subjects was between 52.7 
to 57.1 years (range 20-75) reflecting the OSA target population. According to literature (Malhotra A et al. 2002 
The Lancet. Obstructive sleep apnoea), obesity, male sex, and increasing age were identified as risk factors for 
OSA. Obesity is considered the most important, estimated to be present in about 70% of affected subjects. The 
mean BMI of recruited subjects ranged from 32.92 to 34.07 kg/m2 across treatment arms reflecting obesity of 
the  study  population.  The  OSA  population  is  typically  presenting  with  a  number  of  co-morbidities,  with 
hypertension being one of the most significant. This is reflected by the medical history of included subjects: 
hypertension  is  present  in  44.9-58.6%  of  subjects  across  the  five  study  arms.  Importantly,  the  portion  of 
subjects  compliant  with  primary  OSA  therapy  is  consistent  across  treatment  arms  (68.4-72.9%  across 
treatment arms, 70.5% of overall safety population). 
Choice of Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
Two co-primary efficacy endpoints were chosen (MWT, ESS), both are standard validated parameters to assess 
ability to maintain wakefulness resp. the degree of excessive sleepiness and were used in previous MAAs. Both 
are tested independently for superiority over placebo per dose arm.  
The ESS score reflects the patient’s self-assessment, i.e. the self-evaluated patient’s propensity to fall asleep in 
eight every-day situations (0 = would never doze, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing, 
3 = high chance of dozing, worst possible score is 24). Hence, ESS is a subjective measure.  
On  the  contrary,  during  the  maintenance  of  wakefulness  test  (MWT)  the  onset  of  sleep  is  recorded  by  PSG 
(EEG),  i.e.  the  MWT  is  an  objective  measure.  For  MWT  testing  (five  sessions  per  day,  each  of  a  maximum 
duration of 40 min, separated by 2-hr intervals during which the patient has to stay awake), the subject is placed 
under soporific conditions (i.e. in a semi-recumbent position in a darkened room) and is instructed to stay awake 
as long as possible. The combination of subjective and objective measures as co-primary efficacy endpoints is 
considered to adequately reflect the treatment outcome.

Statistical analysis 
In both pivotal studies, the primary analysis used a MMRM as analysis method. The factors included in the model 
are considered appropriate, as also the stratification factors used for randomisation were included. Methods for 
secondary and exploratory analyses are generally acceptable. 
Missing data is an issue in both studies, as the number of study withdrawals was in a relevant range. For overall 
withdrawals in all study arms combined, there were 14.6% missing in Study14-003 and 19.2% missing in Study 
14-002. Most withdrawals occurred in the dose arm with the highest dose in both studies with adverse events as 
an important reason for drop out in both studies, while numbers for withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were very 
different  in  both  studies  (none  in  Study14-003  and  10.2%  at  maximum  in  the  highest  dose  arm  in  Study 
14-002). 
For the primary analysis, missing data were handled by the implicit completion of measurement profiles by the 
MMRM method and no explicit imputations were performed. The Applicant addressed the missing data issue with 
sensitivity  analyses.  Two  single  imputation  methods  were  used,  applying  LOCF  and  a  mean  imputation 
approach.  Single  imputation  methods  are  not  endorsed,  as  usually  the  variability  of  the  effect  estimates  is 
underestimated,  and  a  bias  cannot  be  excluded  in  depending  on  dropout  patterns.  Alternatively,  multiple 
imputation methods were used to handle missing observations. Thereof, the pattern mixture approach is the 
most  relevant  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  performed.  For  this,  a  tipping  point analysis  was  applied  for  three 
scenarios with data assumed to be missing not at random if patients withdrew due to lack of efficacy (scenario 
1), adverse events (scenario 2) or due to both (scenario 3). Scenario 3 is considered the most appropriate. It is 
therefore  reassuring  that  even  in  extreme  realisations  of  the  delta  method  for  the  tipping  point  analysis  in 
scenario 3 (subtracting increasing proportions of the treatment effect), conclusions on statistical significance 
with very low p-values are not changed for all doses in Study 14-003 and except for the lowest dose strength in 
Study 14-002. 
With regard to general design features (choice of target population, study duration, choice of endpoints and 
statistical analysis, parallel group placebo control) there are no major objections. It is noted, however, that for 
studies 14-002 and 14-003 subjects were assigned to fixed dose arms. In clinical practice, subjects beginning 
solriamfetol therapy are proposed to titrate according to clinical response starting with the 75 mg dose. Data on 
titration are obtained from 6-week randomized withdrawal study 14-004 and long-term extension study 14-005. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Participants flow 
In narcoleptic patients of study 14-002, the overall rate of study completion was high ranging from 88.1% in the 
placebo arm to 72.8% in the 300 mg highest dose arm. Contrary to expectations, however, “lack of efficacy” 
given as reason for withdrawal was lowest in the placebo arm (n=1, 1.7%) and highest in the 300 mg highest 
dose arm (n=6, 10.2%). This finding remains hard to explain. On the other side, there is clear dose-dependent 
increase in the number of subjects withdrawing for AEs from placebo (1.7%) to the 300 mg dose (8.5%). A 
potential overlap in the subject’s perception between “lack of efficacy” and “AE”, when the reason for withdrawal 
is defined, could be assumed to explain the unexpected finding. 
Also in OSA patients of study 14-003, the rate of study completion was high, ranging from 90.6% in the JZP 150 
mg dose arm to 79.7% in the 300 mg highest dose arm. In none of the study arms (incl. placebo), “lack of 
efficacy” was given as reason for withdrawal in any one subject. A possible explanation could be that throughout 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 77/128 
  
  
 
 
the study subjects could continue to use their positive airway pressure (PAP) oxygen therapy, which guarantees 
the current maintenance of standard of care level. As concerns “withdrawal due to AE”, the rate was clearly 
highest in the highest 300 mg dose arm (13.6%) vs 3.4% for placebo and 4.3% in the second highest 150 mg 
dose arm. 
Less than 10% of subjects recruited for phase III studies 14-002 and 14-003 were European, the vast majority 
of  recruited  patients  were  North  American.  Therefore,  any  comparison  between  the  subgroups  by  region  is 
cautioned. However, both sub-populations were largely similar in terms of baseline disease characteristics (both 
for narcolepsy and OSA). Subgroups by region were examined as extrinsic factors for efficacy outcome. As far as 
can  be  concluded  given  the  disparity  in  subgroup  size,  the  response  to  solriamfetol  treatment  was  similar 
between groups for both conditions. 
Efficacy outcome in narcolepsy study 14-002 
For the co-primary MWT (change from baseline) efficacy endpoint a clear dose-dependent effect was observed 
delivering highly significant (p < 0.0001) superiority over placebo for the 150 mg and 300 mg dose arm. In both 
arms patients achieved maintenance of wakefulness more than twice as long as compared to baseline (150 mg: 
from 7.85 min at baseline to 17.67 min at week 12; 300 mg: from 8.73 min at baseline to 19.91 min at week 12 
[means]). Also, for the lowest JZP 75 mg dose arm, maintained wakefulness improved, however, the change 
from baseline does not significantly separate from placebo (change from baseline [min]: placebo 2.12, JZP 75 
mg: 4.74 [-1.04, 6.28; p=0.1595]). 
Also, for the co-primary ESS (change from baseline) efficacy endpoint again a dose-related effect was observed 
delivering significant (75 mg: p=0.02) or highly significant (p < 0.0001) superiority over placebo for the 150 mg 
and 300 mg dose arm. In absolute figures, the decline in subjective, self-assessed propensity to fall asleep in 
typical everyday situations was superior over placebo particularly for the 150 mg and 300 mg dose arm for 
which ESS score could be reduced to about 11 corresponding to mild EDS (150mg: from 17.0 ESS score at 
baseline to 11.5 ESS score at week 12; 300mg from 17.2 ESS score at baseline to 11.1 ESS score at week 
12.)The clinical relevance of the achieved difference (in ESS) over placebo was further characterized by the 
post-hoc calculated responder analysis of subjects achieving an ESS score of < 10, which is cut-off value from 
higher normal DS to mild EDS. The cumulative distribution for ESS demonstrates that only 15.5% of placebo 
patients achieved an ESS score < 10. The proportion of subjects with ESS scores equal to or below 10 increased 
across JZP arms in a dose-dependent manner. It was doubled in the 75 mg dose arm (30.5%) and more than 
tripled  for  the  highest  300  mg  dose  (49.2%).  The  cumulative  distribution  curves  support  concluding  on  a 
relevant dose dependent separation from the placebo response across a large range of response thresholds and 
point to clinically relevant improvement of EDS in narcoleptic patients.  
For both primary efficacy endpoints, the main effect is achieved within the first week of treatment. Thereafter 
the effect is maintained in a dose-related manner over the entire 12-week treatment period. 
The study outcome in terms of the key secondary PGIc endpoint went along with the results for the MWT and 
ESS co-primary endpoints. The percentage of subjects reporting clinical improvement (minimal, much or very 
much) was highly significantly higher for the 150 mg and 300 mg dose arm, while the lowest 75 mg dose arm 
does not significantly separate from placebo (p=0.0023 only nominal, since the 75 mg solriamfetol group was in 
a position in the hierarchy below a non-significant test). The results obtained for the patient-assessed PGIc key 
secondary endpoint were also reflected by the investigator-assessed CGIc endpoint. 
A post-hoc analysis was conducted to assess the correlation between PGIc and ESS in subjects treated with 
solriamfetol (all doses). A reasonable degree of congruence between the ESS primary endpoint and the PGIc key 
secondary endpoint could be shown.

For all three sensitivity analyses (SA1: ANCOVA-LOCF, SA2: ANCOVA-imputation of means of corresponding 
treatment  group,  SA3:  MMRM-MI)  the  results  for  the  150  mg  and  300  mg  JZP  dose  arms  remained  highly 
significant. Also, for the 75 mg dose arm the results obtained using the primary statistical analysis method were 
largely reproduced, delivering non-significant results for MWT (exception for SA2: p=0.0413) and significant 
results for the ESS co-primary endpoint. Sensitivity analysis 4, considered the most relevant, delivered highly 
significant results for both the 150 mg and 300 mg dose arm for both co-primary endpoints even if the maximum 
100% k-value is subtracted from the treatment effect. Equally, results for ESS remained significant for the 75 
mg lowest dose arm. 
MWT testing was performed at baseline, at the week 4 visit and at week 12 or study discontinuation. Prior to 
MWT testing the subject has to stay overnight at the study centre. MWT testing is time-consuming, it spans over 
approximately 9 hours post-administration since the five testing sessions (up to 40 min duration per session) 
are separated by 2-hours intervals. Looking separately at the 5 consecutive testing sessions per day, for the 150 
mg and 300 mg dose arm the difference over placebo remains significant for each of the five sessions. There is 
no clear sign for a declining effect over the course of the testing day. On the other hand, for the 75 mg dose arm, 
for which placebo superiority in terms of the primary MWT endpoint (mean of the first 4 trials) could not be 
shown, did neither significantly separate from placebo at any of the five sessions per testing day. Solriamfetol is 
proposed to be administered once daily upon awakening in the morning. Time course of efficacy on MWT data as 
obtained from study 14-002 support the proposed posology. 
Narcoleptic patients were stratified for presence resp. absence of cataplexy. About half of the subjects of the 
mITT (117/231, 50.6%) population presented with cataplectic events. In absolute figures, the clinical effect in 
terms of MWT change from baseline was more pronounced in subjects without cataplexy. However, there was no 
difference between the two subgroups as regards statistical comparison with placebo for MWT, ESS and the PGIc 
key secondary endpoint. 
Based on subjects’ cataplectic diary entries, the number of cataplectic events was recorded in an exploratory 
way. Interpretation of results is complicated due to differences in the mean number of weekly cataplectic attacks 
across treatment arms during the baseline period (mean number of cataplectic attacks at baseline: placebo 
13.0, JZP 75 mg 18.4, JZP 150 mg 12.5, JZP 300 mg 9.4,). There was a tendency observable of a decline in the 
mean number of weekly cataplectic events over the course of the 12-wk treatment period in the placebo, JZP 75 
mg and JZP 150 mg dose arm, but not in the 300 mg dose group. Overall, there was no consistent pattern across 
dose arms. It is therefore rather unlikely that there is a clear positive impact of solriamfetol on the cataplectic 
attack  frequency.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  no  signal  that  cataplexy  may  be  negatively  influenced  by 
solriamfetol treatment.  
Apart from EDS, cataplexy is the second commonest symptom of narcolepsy and the most specific one (Billiard 
M  et  al.  2006  EFNS  Guidelines  on  management  of  narcolepsy).  The  exploratory  data  on  solriamfetol’s 
(non)-influence on cataplectic event frequency points to adequacy of the Applicant’s clinical development plan to 
focus on a symptom-oriented approach (reduction of EDS) instead of pursuing a more comprehensive treatment 
claim (e.g. “Treatment of narcolepsy”). 
Efficacy outcome in OSA study 14-003 
For  the  co-primary  MWT  (change  from  baseline)  efficacy  endpoint  a  dose-dependent  effect  was  observed 
delivering highly significant (p < 0.0001) superiority over placebo for the 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg dose arms. 
In these 3 arms patients achieved maintenance of wakefulness about twice as long as compared to baseline (75 
mg: from 12.44 min at baseline to 21.79 min at week 12; 150 mg: from 12.54 min to 23.64 min; 300 mg: from 
12.10  min  to  25.28  min  at  week  12  [means]).  Also  for  the  lowest  JZP  37.5  mg  dose  arm,  maintained 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 79/128 
  
  
 
wakefulness improved significantly (change from baseline [min]: placebo 0.21, JZP 37.5 mg: 4.74 [1.16, 7.90; 
p=0.0086]).  
Hence, results for MWT in the OSA population were overall more positive as compared to the results obtained in 
narcoleptic  patients  (study  14-002:  75  mg  dose  arm  did  significantly  separate  from  placebo).  In  absolute 
figures, the mean differences over placebo in terms of maintained wakefulness (as compared to baseline) were 
slightly  larger  in  the  OSA  population  as  compared  to  narcoleptic  patients  (MWT  LS  Mean  Difference  over 
placebo: 14-002 narcolepsy: 75 mg 2.62, 150 mg 7.65, 300 mg 10.14; 14-003 OSA: 75 mg 8.87, 150  mg 
10.74, 300 mg 12.77). 
Along the same lines, for the co-primary ESS (change from baseline) efficacy endpoint again a dose-related 
effect was observed delivering significant (37.5 mg: p=0.0161; 75 mg: p=0.0233) or highly significant (p < 
0.0001)  superiority  over  placebo  for  the  150  mg  and  300  mg  dose  arm.  In  absolute  figures,  the  decline  in 
subjective,  self-assessed  propensity  to  fall  asleep  in  typical  everyday  situations  demonstrated  that  subjects 
allocated to the four JZP dose arms reached mean ESS scores < 10 at week 12 (37.5 mg: 9.7; 75 mg: 10.0; 150 
mg;  7.5;  300  mg:  7.1)  pointing  to  a  level  of  higher  normal  DS  (ESS  category  6-10).  At  baseline  subjects 
presented  with  an  ESS  score  of  about  15  across  treatment  arms  reflecting  moderate  excessive  daytime 
sleepiness (ESS category 13-15).  
The post-hoc calculated responder analysis of subjects achieving an ESS score of < 10 further underlined the 
clinical relevance of the achieved difference over placebo. Cumulative distribution demonstrated that placebo 
response was more pronounced in OSA patients as compared to narcoleptic patients. While in study 14-002 only 
15.5% of subjects allocated to placebo achieved ESS scores < 10, the respective portion of subjects receiving 
placebo was 37.7%. On the other side, the treatment effect in JZP dose groups was also higher for OSA patients: 
In study 14-003, more than 70% of subjects receiving 150 mg resp. 300 mg JZP achieved ESS scores < 10.  
The magnitude of effect was dose-dependent, was observed by Week 1, and was maintained over the 12 weeks 
of treatment on both the MWT and ESS. 
The results for the MWT and ESS co-primary endpoints aligned with those of the key secondary PGIc endpoint. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  clinical  improvement  (minimal,  much  or  very  much)  was  significantly 
higher for the 75 mg dose, and highly significantly higher for the 150 mg and 300 mg dose arms, while the 
lowest  37.5  mg  dose  arm  does  not  significantly  separate  from  placebo  (p=0.4447).  As  compared  to  study 
14-002 in narcoleptic patients, placebo response was more pronounced in OSA patients: 49.1% of OSA patients 
receiving  placebo  reported  to  have  (at  least)  minimally  improved  (placebo  response  in  narcolepsy  patients: 
39.7%). 
Interestingly, Global Impression as improved in the placebo group was equally high, irrespective whether it was 
investigator-assessed  (CGIc  placebo:  49.1%)  or  self-assessed  (PGIc  placebo:  49.1%).  The  rate  of  placebo 
subjects  investigator-rated  as  improved  was  high  and  consistent  over  the  entire  study  duration  (CGIc 
improvement in placebo patients: wk1: 46.5%, wk4: 52.6%, wk8: 49.1%, wk12:49.1%). 
The results of sensitivity analyses 1, 2, and 3 were consistent with and supported the primary analyses, with 
increases observed from Baseline to Week 12 in MWT (in minutes) and reductions in mean ESS Score for all 
JZP-110 dose groups compared with placebo. Highly significant (150 mg and 300 mg dose arms) or significant 
(37.5 mg and 75 mg dose arms) results were maintained for both co-primary endpoints for sensitivity analyses 
1-3. Also, for sensitivity analysis 4, applying progressively more stringent analysis criteria by subtracting an 
increasingly greater percentage of the treatment effect (K) which accounted for dropouts due to AEs, lack of 
efficacy (LOE), and AEs or LOE, the treatment differences in the response (change in mean MWT and ESS), were 
maintained compared with placebo after all adjustments were made for all 4 JZP-110 dose groups.

Looking separately at the 5 consecutive testing sessions per MWT testing day (conducted at baseline, week 4, 
week 12), overall results are more favourable in the OSA population as compared to narcoleptic patients (study 
14-002).  In  both  populations,  for  the  150  mg  and  300  mg  dose  arm  the  difference  over  placebo  remains 
significant resp. highly significant for each of the five sessions. In OSA patients, however, significant results 
were also obtained for the 75 mg dose arm across all 5 MWT testing sessions, whereas in narcoleptic patients 
only numerical improvement over placebo could be shown. 
In absolute figures (maintained wakefulness [in min] change from baseline), there is no clear tendency for a 
declining effect over the course of the testing day. However, at the second and third testing session per day, in 
general, wakefulness is maintained for the longest period of time. 
OSA patients were stratified for their compliance with primary OSA therapy. Baseline values for MWT were lower 
in the sub-group of subjects non-compliant with primary OSA therapy as compared to the total mITT population 
(MWT at baseline total mITT vs non-compliant sub-group: placebo 12.40 vs 11.19, 37.5 mg 13.64 vs 10.40, 75 
mg  13.08  vs  10.68,  150  mg  12.50  vs  10.41,  300  mg  12.00  vs  10.31  min).  The  difference  in  the  ability  to 
maintain  wakefulness  at  baseline  may  be  indicative  of  the  beneficial  effect  of compliance  with  primary OSA 
therapy. 
About 30% of recruited subjects were non-compliant with their primary OSA therapy. While baseline values in 
terms of MWT were slightly lower in the non-compliant sub-group as compared to the total mITT resp. compliant 
population, the outcome after 12 weeks of JZP treatment is largely similar across the compliant, non-compliant 
and total mITT population. The results do therefore not suggest that the effect of JZP was dependent upon 
compliance with primary OSA therapy (e.g. positive airway pressure). The results for ESS in the two sub-groups 
go along the same lines. 
6-Week randomized withdrawal study 14-004 
Study 14-004 was conducted in subjects meeting the ICSD-3 diagnostic criteria for OSA.  
While subjects receiving JZP were assigned to fixed dose arms in studies 14-002 and 14-003, solriamfetol was 
individually titrated in study 14-004, which is considered to provide valuable information for clinical practice. 
Starting with 75 mg once daily, the patient could escalate the dose by one dose step every 3 days up to a 
maximum of 300 mg once daily. Dose titration was successfully completed by 90.2% (157/174) of included 
subjects. More than every second subject completing the titration period (84/157, 53.5%) titrated up to the 
highest 300 mg dose (150 mg: 50/157, 31.8%; 75 mg: 23/157, 14.6%). 
Subjects  were  instructed  to  titrate  towards  the  most  efficacious  /  tolerable  dose.  ESS  self-assessment  was 
undertaken at the beginning and the end of the titration period, resp. beginning and end of the randomized 
withdrawal period. On the other side, AEs were reported daily. It remains somehow questionable how up- resp. 
down-titration could be efficacy-driven given the schedule of assessment. 
The same co-primary resp. key secondary endpoints were evaluated as in phase III studies 14-002 and 14-003. 
Since subjects included in study 14-004 individually titrated the JZP dose according to efficacy resp. tolerability, 
results are presented for all JZP dose arms combined. Being a randomized withdrawal study, the period for 
measuring the efficacy endpoints was between week 4 (at the end of the 2-wk stable dose period) and week 6 
(end of randomized withdrawal). It is considered acceptable to examine randomized withdrawal effects only in 
subjects presenting with a positive treatment effect at week 4 (“much” or “very much improved” on PGIc plus 
numerical improvements in terms of sleep latency [MWT] and EDS [ESS]). 
A  considerable  portion  of  subjects  (21/157,  13.4%)  did  not  meet  entry  criteria  to  enter  the  randomized 
withdrawal period at the end of the two-week stable dose treatment period, because they did not present with 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 81/128 
  
  
 
a  positive  treatment  outcome  by  that  time  (“much  or  very  much  improved”  on  PGIc  plus  numerical 
improvements in MWT and ESS). During the pivotal studies 14-002 and 14-003 it could consistently be shown 
that the main treatment effect in terms of MWT and ESS occurs within the first week of treatment, hence the 
2-week  stable  dose  period  would  be  expected  sufficient  to  meet  the  modest  requirements  for  definition  of 
positive treatment effect. 
After exclusion of subjects not qualifying for randomized withdrawal (mITT) a remarkable treatment effect is 
observed across all efficacy endpoints (Safety population vs mITT: MWT: 12-13 vs 28-32, ESS 15-16 vs 5-6) 
between baseline disease characteristics at study entry and those at week 4. 
Subjects who continued to receive solriamfetol in the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase maintained the treatment 
benefits noted at Week 4, with little change in mean sleep latency (-0.96 minutes) and minimal change in ESS 
score (-0.1). In contrast, the placebo group showed a mean reduction of 12.11 (1.316) minutes in mean sleep 
latency and a 4.5 increase in ESS score at the end of the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase, resulting in statistically 
significant  LS  mean  differences  of  11.16  minutes  on  the  MWT  and  -4.6  on  the  ESS  (p  <  0.0001  for  both 
measures).  
The efficacy data obtained during the 2-wk randomized withdrawal period reveal the symptomatic nature of 
solriamfetol’s beneficial effect. After abrupt cessation of solriamfetol therapy symptoms in terms of daytime 
sleepiness and ability to maintain wakefulness worsen. However, at least at week 6 a minimum positive effect is 
retained: The mean MWT score at baseline of study entry was around 12 in the mITT population, two weeks after 
abrupt cessation subjects in the placebo group could still maintain wakefulness for 17.55 min (mean). The mean 
self-rated  EDS  (ESS)  at  baseline  was  around  16  (categorized  as  moderate  to  severe  excessive  daytime 
sleepiness), two weeks after abrupt cessation subjects in the placebo group still rated their propensity to fall 
asleep in typical everyday situations as 10.8 (mean ESS, thereby achieving the category between higher normal 
and mild excessive daytime sleepiness). Hence, no rebound hypersomnia was observed. 
Long-term extension study 14-005 
In long-term extension study 14-005, the narcolepsy and OSA populations terminating the phase II/III parent 
studies are combined. Subjects from parent studies 14-002 and 14-003 were directly enrolled (Group A), for 
subjects recruited from previous phase II studies there was a treatment gap in between the two studies (Group 
B). Irrespective of the dose received in the parent study, all subjects underwent a 2-wk titration at the start of 
study 14-005, which originally was planned as a long-term open label trial. 
With  Protocol  Amendment  3,  however,  the  2-wk  randomized  withdrawal  period  was  introduced  while 
recruitment had already started. The Applicant explains that the rationale for making this change was that the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expressed strong interest in having long-term controlled efficacy 
data for the studied indications. The design of the randomized withdrawal period in this study was declared to 
have been modelled after the ongoing 6-week randomized withdrawal study of JZP-110 in subjects with OSA 
(14-004) in an attempt to satisfy the requests and anticipated requirements from regulatory authorities.  
Both  in  study  14-004  and  14-005  subjects  followed  the  identical  schedule  to  titrate  to  their  individual  dose 
during the initial two study weeks. In line with study 14-004, there are reservations regarding the question how 
far  titration  was  actually  efficacy-driven  in  study  14-005.  “Investigators  were  instructed  to  titrate  to  the 
maximum dose that was tolerated to maximize therapeutic efficacy”. From its wording, the latter plan would be 
considered a dose escalation scheme rather than dose titration.  
According to the study’s schedule of events, during the first two weeks efficacy parameters (ESS, PGIc, CGIc) 
were only recorded once at the end of the titration period (wk 2). Instead, phone calls were undertaken every 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 82/128 
  
  
 
three  days.  As  far  as  efficacy-driven,  the titration process  is  therefore  not  quantifiable,  but  purely  relies  on 
subjects’ self-estimation. 
Furthermore, it is noted that in study 14-004 subjects had to qualify for being randomized for the withdrawal 
period by demonstrating a positive treatment outcome after two weeks of stable dose treatment (PGIc rating as 
“much or very much improved” plus numerical improvements in MWT and ESS). No such qualification test was 
implemented in study 14-005.  
Despite  the  uncertainties  regarding  the  titration  process,  it  is  considered  that  with  the  introduction  of  an 
intermediate  2-wk  randomized  placebo-controlled  withdrawal  period  the  clinical  meaningfulness  of  study 
14-005 in terms of efficacy was considerably enhanced. Overall, the design of study 14-005 contains a number 
of interesting aspects adding relevant information to the overall data package:  
1.  It is the first and only study including both narcoleptic and OSA patients.  
2.  Subjects start with a 2-wk titration period irrespective of the dose they received in the preceding study 
(studies 14-002 and 14-003 were fixed dose arm studies). Further dose adjustments are permitted until 
week 14 (after 12 weeks of open label treatment).  
3.  Subjects  randomized  to  placebo  during  the  2-wk  randomized  withdrawal  period  resume  medication 
thereafter starting one dose level below their previous dose. 
There was a tendency to titrate towards higher doses during the initial 2-wk titration period of study 14-005. Of 
the  N=643  Combined  JZP-110  overall  safety  population  of  the  open  label  phase  10.0%  (64/643),  32.2% 
(207/643) and 57.9% (372/643) titrated to the 75 mg, 150 mg resp. 300 mg dose. 
While the majority of subjects receiving 300 mg in the parent study (68/115, 59.1%) also titrated to the 300 mg 
dose at the beginning of study 14-005, subjects receiving lower doses in the parent studies (allocated to the 
lower fixed dose arms, e.g. in studies 14-002 resp. 14-003) were more likely to titrate to a higher dose level. 
Throughout  the  parent  studies  (14-002  and  14-003)  subjects  were  assigned  to  fixed  dose  arms.  Given  the 
tendency to titrate towards higher doses (irrespective of the dose received in the parent study) observed during 
the initial titration period of study 14-005, one may assume that during the fixed dose trials subjects tended to 
be rather underdosed than overdosed. 
As concerns representation of the two disease subgroups (narcolepsy, OSA), about two thirds of subjects were 
OSA patients (417/643 [64.9%]), the remaining subjects were narcoleptic patients (226/643 [35.1%]). With 
regard to their overall health conditions and spectrum of co-morbidities resp. co-medication, long term safety 
data obtained in OSA patients are considered particularly informative. 
Across all four dose levels of the parent studies the highest completion rates were achieved in subjects titrating 
to 150 mg resp. 300 mg solriamfetol during the open label phase of study 14-005. 
The study completion rate was slightly higher in the OSA patients subgroup (73.9%) as compared to narcoleptic 
patients  (66.4%).  About  10%  of  subjects  did  not  complete  the  study  due  to  AEs.  The  portions  of  subjects 
discontinuing because of adverse events was about equal between the two subgroups (OSA: 9.1%, narcolepsy 
10.2%).  Interestingly,  there  was  an  inverse  relationship  between  the  titrated  dose  level  and  the  rate  of 
discontinuation due to AE in the overall population and for both subgroups. The data are to be interpreted with 
caution because numbers of subjects per dose group are not equally distributed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 83/128 
  
  
 
As concerns discontinuation due to lack of efficacy there is some disparity between the two subgroups: while 
39/226 (17.3%) of narcoleptic patients discontinued the open label period due to lack of efficacy, the respective 
portion was considerably lower in OSA patients (15/417, 3.6%).  
Different  subject  numbers  per  dose  level  between  the  two  disease  subgroups  data  require  cautious  data 
interpretation.  However,  taking  into  consideration  that  study  14-005  started  with  a  2-wk  individual  dose 
titration period and the opportunity to adjust the titrated dose three times over the subsequent 12 weeks of 
treatment, the high incidence of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy in the two lower dose groups (75 mg: 
26.7%; 150 mg: 25.4%) in narcoleptic patients (but not in OSA patients) appears unexpected. It is noted that 
OSA patients were allowed to continue their primary OSA therapy (e.g. PAP), while narcolepsy patients had to 
discontinue any previous medication taken for narcolepsy (OTC sleeping aids, stimulants (pseudoephedrine), 
methylphenidate,  amphetamines,  modafinil,  sodium  oxybate  etc.).  However,  the  effect  of  discontinuing 
previous medication would be expected to be diminished by individual dose titration, in particular in a long-term 
study where the majority of subjects already have been treated with solriamfetol over 12 weeks.  
Compared to the ESS score of last assessment in the parent study (ESS: placebo: 10.54, JZP combined 9.26), 
daytime  sleepiness  further  improved  over  the  26  weeks  open  label  treatment  before  randomization  to  the 
withdrawal period in the overall mITT population (ESS at efficacy baseline: placebo 7.8, JZP combined 7.3). 
When treatment was withdrawn, sleepiness worsens in the placebo group (ESS 12.6 at the end of the 2-wk 
withdrawal period),but remains almost unchanged in those subjects remaining on JZP treatment (ESS 8.5). The 
difference between the placebo and JZP combined group was highly significant for the overall mITT population 
and for both disease subgroups. 
Looking at Efficacy Baseline ESS scores after 26 weeks of open label treatment, there was a difference in the 
treatment  outcome  between  OSA  and  narcolepsy  patients.  While  EDS  markedly  improved  in  OSA  patients 
(efficacy  baseline  ESS  6.5-5.9),  the effect  was  less favourable in narcolepsy  patients  (efficacy  baseline ESS 
11.0-10.9).  
Focussing on Group A for ESS over time, it is to be noted that subjects of Group A (originating from studies 
14-002 resp. 14-003) directly enrolled in study 14-005 after termination of the parent study without treatment 
interruption. In Group A “Baseline” data represent baseline ESS scores at the start of the parent study (Overall 
15.9, Narcolepsy 17.3, OSA 15.2). Data referred to as “Study Baseline” represent the treatment outcome of the 
12-wk treatment during the parent study (Overall 10.6, narcolepsy 13.2, OSA 9.1). “Week 2” data represent the 
effect of the 2-wk titration period at the beginning of study 14-005 (Overall 7.6, Narcolepsy 10.0, OSA 6.2). 
Without considering the intermediate 2-wk randomized withdrawal period in a subset of the presented Safety 
Population, open label treatment is continued until week 40 (Overall 8.3, Narcolepsy 11.4, OSA 6.5). Adding the 
12 weeks treatment of the parent study, thereby an overall treatment duration of 52 weeks is obtained in Group 
A subjects. 
Throughout the entire timespan from baseline of the parent study to baseline of study 14-005, and the titration 
effect until the end of the 40-wk open label phase, ESS scores in narcoleptic subjects are considerably higher as 
compared to OSA subjects. After the titration period daytime sleepiness remained at a “higher normal” level, as 
reflected by ESS scores in the range of (or below) 10 in narcoleptic patients.  
Despite the slightly increasing ESS scores in narcoleptic patients (Group A: ESS at wk 2: 10.0, at wk 40: 11.4) 
with increasing treatment duration, it is concluded that maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated throughout 
the 40 weeks (Group A) resp. 52 weeks (Group B) treatment period in study 14-005 for both narcoleptic and 
OSA patients.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data obtained from pivotal trials conducted in narcoleptic patients (study 14-002) and OSA patients 
(study 14-003) demonstrated superiority over placebo and therefore support the use of solriamfetol to improve 
wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in both subpopulations. No curative intent is associated 
with the product. Indeed, other clinical symptoms of narcolepsy (e.g. the number of cataplectic events) were 
unaffected  by  solriamfetol  treatment,  thereby  confirming  the  symptom-oriented  approach.  Similarly,  the 
symptomatic treatment of sleepiness with solriamfetol would not affect the pathophysiology of OSA being upper 
airway  obstruction  the  leading  cause  of  hypoxia  and  hypercapnia  during  sleep  -important  determinants  of 
daytime ES- and increased CV risk. The two pivotal trials are complemented by data obtained from a 6-week 
randomized  withdrawal  study  (14-004)  in  OSA  patients  after  individual  dose  titration  over  two  weeks.  No 
rebound  excessive  sleepiness  was  observed  in  patients  allocated  to  placebo  during  the  2-week  randomized 
withdrawal period. 
Maintenance  of  effect  was  demonstrated  in  long  term  extension  study  14-005  including  subjects  with  both 
underlying  conditions  (narcolepsy  and  OSA).  In  summary,  from  the  efficacy  perspective,  the  clinical 
development is considered to adequately support the proposed indication of solriamfetol. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical programme supporting the development of solriamfetol for the treatment of EDS in narcolepsy and 
OSA consisted of 9 studies in healthy volunteers and special populations, 3 studies in subjects with MDD and 6 
studies in subjects with narcolepsy or OSA. Safety data from this development programme are summarized, 
with particular focus on the safety profile of solriamfetol in the target population (patients with narcolepsy or 
OSA) at dose ranges studied in the Phase 3 clinical studies (37.5 mg to 300 mg). 
To characterize the safety of solriamfetol in subjects with narcolepsy and subjects with OSA, studies of similar 
design  and/or  population  were  pooled  for  integrated  analysis.  Pool  1  consists  of  the  12-week, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies in subjects with narcolepsy or OSA (ADX-N05 202, 14-002, 14-003). 
After completing participation in one of the parent narcolepsy or OSA studies (ADX-N05 201, ADX-N05 202, 
14-002, 14-003, 14-004, 15-004, or 15-005), subjects meeting entry criteria could enrol in the open-label, 
long-term extension, Study 14-005. Safety data from these parent studies were combined with Study 14-005 
data in Pool 2. 
Across  the  development  program  through  08  February  2018  (comprising  all  completed  studies),  the  overall 
number of unique subjects exposed to solriamfetol is N=1605. A total of N=741 subjects received placebo (some 
of whom also received solriamfetol).  
Across the studies in subjects with narcolepsy and OSA, N=935 subjects were exposed to solriamfetol. Exposure 
was at least 6 months for N=531 subjects and at least 12 months for N=281 subjects. By design, placebo was 
not administered for longer than 3 months in any of the studies. Among the N=321 subjects with narcolepsy, 
exposure was at least 6  months for N=172 subjects and at least 12 months for N=95 subjects. Among the 
N=614 subjects with OSA, exposure was at least 6 months for N=359 subjects and at least 12 months for N=186 
subjects.

Adverse events 
Adverse Events by System Organ Class in Pools 1 and 2 
In the studies in narcolepsy and OSA, among subjects who received solriamfetol, the SOCs with the highest 
incidence  of  AEs  were  Gastrointestinal  Disorders,  Nervous  System  Disorders,  Psychiatric  Disorders,  and 
Infections and Infestations; except for Infections and Infestations, the incidence in these SOCs was higher with 
solriamfetol than with placebo in the 12-week studies.

Adverse Events of Interest 
Adverse  events  of  interest  (AEOI)  for  narcolepsy  and  OSA  were  selected  based  on  the  pharmacology  of 
solriamfetol and experience from clinical studies, comorbidities in the target patient population, safety issues 
associated  with  current  available  treatments,  and  regulatory  considerations  for  New  Chemical  Entities  or 
regulatory requests.

Cardiovascular Adverse Events of Interest 
Based  on  the  pharmacology  of  solriamfetol,  together  with  the  experience  from  clinical  studies  and  the 
comorbidities in the target patient population (especially OSA) cardiovascular events (CV) were identified as 
Adverse Events of Special Interest.  
In Pool 1, Serious CV events occurred in one subject (0.17%; non cardiac chest pain in a narcolepsy subject), 
compared  to  no  serious  events  in  placebo;  CV  events  leading  to  discontinuation  occurred  in  7/573  (1.2%) 
among solriamfetol treated subjects (all in subjects with OSA except for 1 event of palpitations in a subject with 
narcolepsy), compared with no such event in the placebo group. The 7 CV events leading to discontinuation were 
the following: chest discomfort (3 events), non-cardiac chest pain (2 events), palpitations (2 events).  
As regards to the adverse events positively adjudicated as cardiovascular in Pool  1, 3/573 (0.5%) subjects 
treated with solriamfetol presented cardiovascular events [1 coronary heart disease (non treatment emergent), 
1  blood  pressure  increased  (0.2%),  1  hypertension  (0.2%)],  compared  with  no  such  events  in  the  placebo 
group.  All of the positively adjudicated events occurred in subjects with OSA, at the higher doses 150 and 300 
mg. 
In  the  12-week  placebo-controlled  study  (14-003),  AEs  of  hypertension/BP  increased  occurred  at  a  greater 
frequency in those treated with solriamfetol (10/353, 2.8%) compared to placebo (no subjects). All cases were 
mild or moderate in severity and occurred at the 150 or 300 mg doses.

(Study 14-003 - Safety Population) 
In Pool 2 (all narcolepsy and OSA studies) serious CV occurred in 5/935 (0.5%) of subjects, all in OSA subjects 
(Acute  myocardial  infarction,  Atrial  fibrillation  [2  subjects],  Angina  pectoris,  and  Deep  vein  thrombosis).  In 
addition,  one  SAE  of  cerebrovascular  accident  (haemorrhage)  occurred  in  subjects  with  OSA;  a  further  non 
serious event of aphasia occurred in another subject with OSA.   
As regards to the adverse events positively adjudicated as cardiovascular in Pool  2, 20/935 subjects (2.1%) 
had  at  least  one  event:  blood  pressure  increased  (8  subjects),  hypertension  (6  subjects),  acute  myocardial 
infarction  (1  subject),  atrial  fibrillation  (in  3  subjects;  1  prior  to  solriamfetol  exposure),  cerebrovascular 
accident, pulmonary embolism, ventricular tachycardia  (1 subject each). All positively adjudicated CV events 
occurred in subjects with OSA. 
In the long-term study (14-005), in the OSA population, AEs of hypertension/BP increased were reported in 22 
subjects (5.3%) treated with solriamfetol; a greater percentage of subjects had an event at the 300 mg dose 
(Table below). Most events were mild or moderate in severity; none were serious. The majority of these subjects 
(13/22 [59.1%]) had a medical history of BP increased or hypertension and required anti-HTN treatment or 
modification of their current anti-HTN therapy. The majority of the events resolved with continued dosing of 
solriamfetol; three subjects (0.72%) discontinued the study due to the AEs of BP increased (2 subjects) and 
hypertension (1 subject) (see Table 21)

In Pool 3 (Major Depressive Disorder Pooled Studies) adverse events positively adjudicated as cardiovascular 
occurred  in  3/327  subjects  (0.9%),  compared  with  no  event  in  placebo  (N=141).  One  event  of  myocardial 
infarction occurred in the ≤300 mg group and 2 events of hypertension occurred (one each in the ≤300 mg  and 
>300 mg groups.

Adverse Drug Reactions 
Common ADRs are those occurring at a rate of ≥1% in the combined solriamfetol treatment group and higher 
than the placebo rate; less common adverse reactions are those occurring at a rate < 1% but higher than the 
placebo rate. 
Except for headache, which was more frequent in subjects with narcolepsy than with OSA, the profile of adverse 
drug reactions was comparable between the populations with narcolepsy and with OSA. Therefore, the proposed 
label presents adverse drug reactions for the combined population. 
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) associated more often with the use of solriamfetol than placebo 
were headache, nausea, decreased appetite, anxiety, diarrhoea, dry mouth, and insomnia. A majority of these 
events were mild to moderate in severity and occurred within the first 2 weeks of initiating study drug.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No subjects died during the 12-week placebo-controlled studies in narcolepsy and OSA, the studies in MDD, the 
studies in healthy volunteers or in studies in special populations. 
One  subject  with  OSA  died  during  the  open-label  extension  Study  14-005.  The  subject  was  a  70-year-old 
immunosuppressed  white  male  with  OSA,  with  a  medical  history  of  diabetes  mellitus,  rheumatoid  arthritis, 
pulmonary fibrosis, coronary artery disease and bipolar disorder. 
Serious AE in all studies in narcolepsy and OSA (Pool 2) 
Across all studies in subjects with narcolepsy or OSA receiving solriamfetol, 3.6% of subjects (34/935) had at 
least 1 SAE during the study; onset of SAEs was during solriamfetol exposure in 3% of subjects (28/935) and 
after the last dose in 1.1% of subjects (10/903). The only SAEs that occurred in more than 1 subject during 
treatment or after the last dose were atrial fibrillation (occurred in 1 subject after last dose), non-cardiac chest 
pain, cholecystitis acute, alcohol poisoning, and dizziness, each of which occurred in 2 subjects (2/935; 0.21%).

Laboratory findings 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Across the solriamfetol clinical development programme, and across all populations studied, no evidence of 
clinically meaningful changes associated with solriamfetol was identified in review of clinical laboratory data. 
Regular Vital Sign Measurements 
12-Week Placebo-Controlled Studies 
Vital  signs  (including  BP  and  HR)  were  comprehensively  characterized  across  the  solriamfetol  clinical 
development programme, and were assessed in 3 ways in the Phase 3 narcolepsy and OSA studies: 
• 
• 
• 
Regular vital sign measurements at each clinic visit with no relationship to dosing time (i.e., the 
time of dosing relative to the assessment of the vital signs is not specified) 
Multiple  sequential  vital  sign  measurements  on  MWT  days  at  fixed  times  relative  to  dosing  to 
characterize  the  time  course  across  the  day  while  subject  is  in  the  clinical  setting  (i.e.,  time  of 
dosing is specified) 
24-hour  ambulatory  blood  pressure  monitoring  (ABPM)  while  subjects  were  in  the  outpatient 
environment with no relationship to dosing time 
Due to the three ways of measurement, a multitude of data was provided. In general, the effects of solriamfetol 
on HR and BP point to dose relationship with the largest magnitude and duration of effect observed for the 
solriamfetol 300 mg dose. However, dose dependency was not fully consistent, in particular with regard to the 
150 mg dose arm. 
Studies  14-002  and  14-003  assessed  BP  and  HR  over  24  hours  via  24-hr  ambulatory  monitoring,  which  is 
considered  particularly  informative.  For  ABPM,  BP  and  pulse  were  collected  every  30  minutes  for  a  24-hour 
period at Screening (baseline) and the Week 8 visit. Subjects were instructed to take study drug in the morning 
after waking up, but the precise time of dosing was not recorded. 
For both the narcolepsy and OSA populations, the largest mean increases in blood pressure and heart rate from 
baseline to Week 8 were observed at the 300 mg solriamfetol dose. However, in the OSA population, mean 
increases in SBP were similar for the 75 and 300 mg solriamfetol doses. In general, the magnitude of increase 
in  BP  for  the  300  mg  solriamfetol  dose  relative  to  placebo  was  similar  between  the  narcolepsy  and  OSA 
populations. The magnitude of increase in HR was higher for subjects with narcolepsy compared with subjects 
with  OSA.  The  duration  of  effect  for  the  300  mg  solriamfetol  dose  on  BP  and  HR  was  similar  between  the 
narcolepsy and OSA populations and was observed early in the morning (~6-8 AM) and tapered in the evening 
(~4-8 PM). 
Categorical Changes on Maintenance of Wakefulness Test Days 
The categorical change criteria for BP were increases or decreases from baseline by ≥ 5 mmHg, 10 mmHg, 20 
mmHg, and 30 mmHg. For HR, categorical change criteria were ≥ 5 bpm, 10 bpm, 15 bpm, and 30 bpm. The 
percentage of subjects who had changes below or above the normal range values in BP (< 90 mmHg or ≥ 140 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019

mmHg for SBP, and < 60 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg for DBP), as well as the percentage of subjects who had changes 
below or above the normal range values for HR (< 60 bpm or >100 bpm) are also summarized for Week 12. 
For categorical changes in SBP: 
•  Differences in the percentage of subjects with categorical increases in systolic blood pressure were most 
apparent for 300 mg solriamfetol for each indication compared to placebo. For other solriamfetol dose 
groups, the percentage of subjects with categorical increases in SBP was not dose-related and there 
were no clear differences compared to placebo. 
•  A  higher  percentage  of  narcolepsy  subjects  receiving  300  mg  solriamfetol  had  increases  ≥  5  mmHg 
(40.5%),  compared  to  placebo  (33.3%);  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  categorical  increases  ≥  10 
mmHg was similar between treatment groups and no subjects had increases ≥ 20 mmHg. 
•  A higher percentage of OSA subjects receiving 300 mg solriamfetol had increases ≥ 10 mmHg and ≥ 20 
mmHg (25.5% and 6.4%, respectively) compared to placebo (8.0% and no subjects, respectively). One 
subject with OSA who received 300 mg solriamfetol had an increase ≥ 30 mmHg. 
For categorical changes in HR: 
•  A higher percentage of subjects receiving solriamfetol had categorical increases ≥ 5 and ≥ 10 bpm for 
each indication and this was generally dose-related. No subject had increases ≥ 30 bpm. 
•  A  higher  percentage  of  narcolepsy  subjects  receiving  solriamfetol  were  found  to  have  categorical 
increases  ≥   5  bpm  (28.6%,  32.0%,  and  43.0%  for  75  mg,  150  mg,  and  300  mg  solriamfetol, 
respectively) and ≥ 10 bpm (10.2%, 8.0%, and 15.2% for 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg solriamfetol, 
respectively), compared to placebo (18.9% and 6.7%, respectively). A higher percentage of subjects 
receiving 300 mg solriamfetol had increases ≥ 15 bpm (7.6%) compared to placebo (3.3%). 
•  A higher percentage of OSA subjects receiving solriamfetol were found to have categorical increases ≥ 5 
bpm  (24.5%,  20.8%,  33.3%,  and  41.5%  for  37.5  mg,  75  mg,  150  mg,  and  300  mg  solriamfetol, 
respectively) and ≥ 10 bpm (8.2%, 3.8%, 10.5%, and 6.4% for 37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg 
solriamfetol,  respectively),  compared  to  placebo  (18.0%  and  2.0%,  respectively).  Few  subjects had 
increases ≥ 15 bpm in heart rate, with no differences between treatment groups. 
• 
Three narcolepsy subjects had changes above the normal range values in HR (> 100 bpm; 1 subject who 
received 150 mg solriamfetol, and 2 subjects who received 300 mg solriamfetol). No subjects with OSA 
had changes above the normal range values in heart rate. 
In the overall OSA safety population of study 14-005 (N=417 combined solriamfetol), a total of 263 subjects 
(63.1%) treated with solriamfetol had changes in SBP that were >5 mmHg; 216 subjects (51.8%) treated with 
solriamfetol  had  changes  in  DBP  that  were  >5  mmHg;  232  subjects  (55.6%)  treated  with  solriamfetol  had 
changes in HR that were >5 bpm; the effects were dose-related.

Safety in special populations 
Age 
In narcolepsy and OSA subjects within the 12-week placebo-controlled studies and for all studies in narcolepsy 
and OSA by solriamfetol exposure duration (Pool 2), subgroup analyses of TEAEs by age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 
years) did not show meaningful differences. 
Weight and BMI 
Based on the AE overview of subgroups by baseline BMI (< 30 kg/m2 vs ≥ 30 kg/m2) in the 12-week 
placebo-controlled studies in narcolepsy and OSA, subjects with higher BMI did not have a higher incidence of 
TEAEs, SAEs, or TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation compared with those having lower BMI. No 
trends were observed for the subgroup analyses by baseline BMI in narcolepsy and OSA subjects. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation due to adverse events was twice as frequent in Combined JZP-110 OSA and Narcolepsy groups 
as compared with Placebo groups. The main reason leading discontinuation were psychological in OSA (anxiety 
and feeling jittery) and cataplexy in Narcolepsy.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
Exposure 
Considering  the  target  population  as  a  whole  (incl.  narcolepsy  and  OSA),  the  scope  of  overall  exposure 
(N=1605, incl. MDD patients and healthy subjects), exposure over 6 resp. 12 months is considered adequate 
and largely concordant with the provisions with the Note for Guidance on Population Exposure: The Extent of 
Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety, CPMP/ICH/375/95. Across the studies in subjects with narcolepsy 
and OSA, 935 subjects were exposed to solriamfetol. Exposure was at least 6 months for 531 subjects and at 
least 12 months for 281 subjects (95 narcoleptic and 186 OSA patients received solriamfetol for > 12 months). 
Target population

Baseline characteristics in terms of age, sex, BMI and co-morbidities are considered to typically represent the 
target OSA resp. narcoleptic subpopulations. Studies in subjects with narcolepsy enrolled a younger population 
(36-37 years) compared with studies in subjects with OSA (53-54 years). The majority of subjects enrolled in 
narcolepsy studies were female (60-67%) while the majority of subjects enrolled in OSA studies were male 
(61-64%). Baseline body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was higher for subjects with OSA (appr. 33 kg/m2) compared 
with subjects with narcolepsy (appr. 28 kg/m2). As concerns heart rate (narcolepsy: 70.8 – 73.3, OSA 75.9 – 
76.6) and systolic blood pressure (narcolepsy: 117.2 – 119.8, OSA: 127.6 – 127.4) mean values are slightly 
higher in the OSA subpopulation. Mean values for vital signs HR and BP are in the normal range across both 
disease subgroups. 
OSA  is  a  risk  factor  for  hypertension,  coronary  artery  disease,  and  stroke.  Patients  with  OSA  are  also  at 
increased risk of atrial fibrillation, Type II diabetes and cancer (Garvey et al. 2015). Apart from the higher BMI 
value, OSA patients often present with medical history suggestive of metabolic syndrome. This is reflected by a 
considerably higher  portion  of  OSA  subjects  receiving  antihypertensive  medication  ([narcolepsy  /  OSA]  ACE 
inhibitors: 3.7-6.8% / 14.4-18.1%, AT II antagonists 0.9 – 2.3% / 12.7 – 12.8%, beta blockers 3.7 – 4.6% / 
12.7 – 9.9%), lipid modifying agents (narcolepsy 4.6 – 7.7%, OSA 35.6 – 37.4%), and antidiabetics incl. insulin 
(narcolepsy 3.7 – 4.1%, OSA 23.7 – 23.0%).  
Evidence was provided that demonstrates that the recruited OSA population is representative for OSA patients 
in clinical practice in terms of mean age, gender distribution, BMI, comorbid hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia 
and diabetes. As concerns the CV risk profile of recruited subjects, a number of CV risk patient groups were 
excluded according to the exclusion criteria (see relevant sections in AR). 
Overall, it is concluded that the specified exclusion criteria regarding CV risk patients (mainly excluding those 
with  acutely  unstable  or  uncontrolled  conditions)  are  acceptable  and  do  not  principally  question 
representativeness of the study population. Respective warning statements are implemented in SmPC section 
4.4. 
Also with regard to the portion of included OSA patients > 65 years (116/615, 19%), the targeted population is 
considered representative. In a recent literature overview on sleep apnoea in older people the prevalence of OSA 
in people over 65 years was estimated to range between 13-32% (Glassner et al. 2011). With regard to the 
overall target population (OSA + narcolepsy) the portion of patients > 65 years is about 13%, hence, elderly are 
higher represented in the OSA as compared to the narcolepsy population, which is consistent with the mean age 
of affected subjects for each condition. 
While subjects with bipolar disorders or schizophrenia were excluded from phase III studies, about a quarter of 
subjects  included  in  long-term  study  14-005  presented  with  comorbid  depression  (narcolepsy  26.5%,  OSA 
22.5%). Through reported enhancement of neurotransmitter (DA, NE) signalling the whole range of potential 
CNS-related undesirable effects plus effects on vital signs (BP, HR) are considered typical class-related ADRs. In 
other drug substances with similar mode of action symptoms like anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, increase in 
systolic blood pressure and heart rate were observed. In long-term study 14-005 a considerable portion of both 
narcoleptic  (12.8%)  and  OSA  patients  (12.5%)  presented  with  a  history  of  anxiety.  As  a  general  safety 
measure, the influence on suicidal ideation was routinely monitored by means of the Columbia-Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C-SSRS) throughout the clinical trial programme of solriamfetol.

Frequent AEs by SOC 
Solriamfetol’s  molecular  mode  of  action  is  reported  to  be  based  on  selective  dopamine  and  norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibition (DNRI). In line with assumed enhancement of NE and DA signalling, the highest incidence of 
AEs by SOC were Gastrointestinal Disorders, Nervous System Disorders, Psychiatric Disorders. The summary of 
AEs per SOC, disease subpopulation and treatment duration (12-wk Pool 1 vs 1-yr Pool 2) shows a general 
tendency for higher AE incidence in the narcoleptic population as compared to OSA patients (with the most 
striking difference for Nervous System Disorders: Pool 1: narcolepsy 27.27%, OSA 16.71). Notably, over the 
12-wk treatment period (Pool 1) the incidence in Cardiac Disorders was three times higher for JZP combined 
(4.01%) as compared to placebo (1.33%). 
Common AE 
Cardiac disorders (SOC 3-times elevated over placebo) mainly refer to palpitations and increase of heart rate. 
The  higher  incidence  of  Psychiatric  Disorders  reflects  the  symptom  complex  of  anxiety,  feeling  jittery  and 
irritability. Nervous System Disorders mainly correspond to headache, dry mouth and dizziness. Further groups 
of AEs occurring more often in JZP treatment (as compared to placebo) concern the gastrointestinal system 
(nausea 9.25%, decreased appetite 9.08%, diarrhoea 5.24%, constipation 2.09%), respiratory tract infections 
(nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, cough) and bone / muscle related AEs (arthralgia, muscle spasms, myalgia).  
Broken  down  to  the  four  dose  levels  of  JZP  examined  throughout  the  12-wk  trials,  there  is  either  a  clear 
dose-response relationship for AEs (headache, decreased appetite, anxiety, diarrhoea, dry mouth), a tendency 
towards higher incidence with increasing dose (nausea, insomnia, dizziness, feeling jittery, heart rate increased) 
or  no  dose  response  relation  discernible  (nasopharyngitis,  palpitations,  sinusitis,  constipation,  arthralgia, 
muscle spasms). 
TEAEs 
During  treatment  with  solriamfetol,  76.9%  of  subjects  (719/935)  had  at  least  one  TEAE.  The  profile  of  AEs 
during solriamfetol exposure across all narcolepsy and OSA studies including from the long-term Study 14-005 
was generally comparable with that for the 12-week placebo-controlled studies in narcolepsy and OSA studies. 
TEAEs that were most commonly (≥5%) reported during solriamfetol exposure were headache (16.8%), nausea 
(12.9%), insomnia (9.0%), decreased appetite (9.2%), anxiety (9.4%), nasopharyngitis (8.9%), dry mouth 
(8.6%),  dizziness  (6.0%),  diarrhoea  (5.4%),  and  feeling  jittery  (5.0%).  There  was  no  obvious  pattern  with 
respect to AEs following long term exposure. 
TEAEs were observed during treatment initition periods by the majority of the subjects. The most commonly 
reported TEAEs in the 12-week placebo controlled studies were reported in the first 2 weeks of treatment. With 
regard  to  duration  of  adverse  events,  a  number  of  AEs  resolve  within  a  few  days  after  treatment  initiation 
(diarrhoea, dizziness, feeling jittery, headache) for the majority of affected subjects. Other AEs appear to persist 
for longer (median duration in days: Decreased appetite 18.0, dry mouth 35.5, irritability 62.0, pruritis 28.0) 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
Common ADRs were defined as those occurring at a rate of ≥1% in the combined solriamfetol treatment group 
and higher than the placebo rate. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) associated more often with the 
use of solriamfetol than placebo were headache, nausea, decreased appetite, anxiety, diarrhea, dry mouth, and 
insomnia. In fact, headache is the only ADR with an apparent unbalance in incidence between the two disease 
populations (for combined JZP: narcolepsy 46/220, 21%; OSA: 38/353, 11%). The listed common ADRs are 
adequately reflected in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC.

Adverse events of interest (AEOI) 
Cardiovascular Events 
Hypertension / Blood Pressure Increased / Heart rate increased 
In the 12-week placebo-controlled studies in narcolepsy and OSA, events of hypertension/increased BP occurred 
at a greater frequency in those treated with solriamfetol (13/573, 2.27%) compared to placebo (1/226, 0.44%). 
The  frequency  of  the  TEAE  increased  blood  pressure  was  similar  between  indications  (narcolepsy,  OSA).  All 
cases were mild or moderate in severity and occurred at the 150 or 300 mg solriamfetol dose level. One subject 
discontinued the study due to the TEAE of increased blood pressure. 
Frequencies of TEAEs of hypertension/ blood pressure increased (SMQ) displayed by exposure duration time 
interval in Pool 2 showed that events of hypertension continue to occur also with longer exposure durations. 
Vital sign measurement was undertaken within three different testing settings (at each clinical study visit [with 
no relationship to dosing time], through multiple sequential measurements on MWT testing days [at fixed times 
relative to dosing], and through 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) while subjects were in the outpatient 
environment with no relationship to dosing time). Thereby, a comprehensive data package was provided. ABMP 
measurement is considered particularly informative since it allows continuous BP / HR monitoring over 24 hours, 
thereby  allowing  to  identify  peak  levels  and  maintenance  of  effects.  The  duration  of  effect  for  the  300  mg 
solriamfetol dose on BP and HR was similar between the narcolepsy and OSA populations, and was observed 
early in the morning (~6-8 AM) and tapered in the evening (~4-8 PM). Overall, there were consistent increases 
in BP and HR in subjects receiving 300 mg solriamfetol, however, the natural diurnal course of vital signs was 
unchanged. 
For both the narcolepsy and OSA populations, the largest mean increases in blood pressure and heart rate from 
baseline to Week 8 were observed at the 300 mg solriamfetol dose (ABPM). However, in the OSA population, 
mean increases in SBP were similar for the 75 and 300 mg solriamfetol doses. In general, the magnitude of 
increase in BP for the 300 mg solriamfetol dose relative to placebo was similar between the narcolepsy and OSA 
populations. In absolute figures, mean increases of SBP were 2.1 -2.7 mm Hg for the 75 mg resp. 300 mg dose 
in  narcoleptic  patients  and  1.5  -3.7  mm  Hg  in  OSA  patients.  Mean  increases  in  HR  were  slightly  higher  in 
narcolepsy (1.6-5.9 bpm) as compared to OSA (1.2 – 2.4 bpm) 8 weeks after treatment initiation in 12-wk 
studies 14-002 and 14-003. 
Apart from mean values for BP / HR increase, particular attention is to be paid to categorical changes from 
baseline. When BP was assessed at each clinical study visit, even for the 300 mg solriamfetol dose there was no 
elevation in categorical changes from baseline for >5, >10, >20 mm Hg SBP in the overall safety population. 
However higher frequencies compared to placebo were observed for the 300 mg solriamfetol dose in categorical 
changes from baseline for >5, >10, >20 mm Hg SBP assessed through multiple sequential measurements on 
MWT testing days (> 5 bpm: 30% vs 37%, >10 bpm: 11% vs 20%, > 15 bpm: 0% vs 3%).  Similarly, higher 
frequencies compared to placebo were observed for the 300 mg solriamfetol dose in categorical changes from 
baseline for ≥10 mm Hg SBP assessed through ABPM.  
For HR, categorical changes observed for the 300 mg dose were considerably higher as compared to placebo, 
regardless of the method used to assess HR (regularly vital signs assessment at each clinical study visit: (> 5 
bpm:  69.6%  vs  56.9%,  >10  bpm:  49.1%  vs  38.1%,  >  15  bpm:  28.5%  vs  23.8%)  in  the  overall  safety 
population.

Page 102/128 
  
  
 
 
 
A  more  heterogeneous  picture  is  obtained,  if  broken  down  to  disease  sub-populations.  In  terms  of  SBP,  in 
narcolepsy categorical changes from baseline are lower for the 300 mg dose arm (> 5 mm Hg: 59.8%, > 10 mm 
Hg: 41.2%, > 20 mm Hg: 16.5%) as compared to placebo (> 5 mm Hg: 67.9%, > 10 mm Hg: 51.9%, > 20 mm 
Hg: 21.7%). In OSA patients, however, the respective categorical changes were higher in the 300 mg dose arm 
(> 5 mm Hg: 57.3%, > 10 mm Hg: 40.2%, > 20 mm Hg: 14.5%) as compared to placebo (> 5 mm Hg: 54.7%, 
> 10 mm Hg: 30.8%, > 20 mm Hg: 11.9%. 
Epidemiological evidence shows that even a 2-3 mmHg increase in existing high blood pressure increases rates 
of stroke, heart attack and death. Therefore, particular concern was raised with regard to the CV risk profile of 
solriamfetol in the OSA population.  
The results for the mean changes in vital signs from baseline relative to placebo in BP and HR in the 12-wk OSA 
population do not show a clear dose dependency across the four dose arms for SBP and DBP. Only for HR, a 
consistent increase in HR is observed across dose arms. What both changes in BP and HR have in common, 
however, is the fact that the change versus baseline was most prominent in the highest dose group.  
Taking  the  change  in  vital  signs  during  long  term  study  14-005  into  consideration,  dose  dependency  of 
categorical changes in SBP, DBP, resp. HR is more evident. Across the categorical changes, almost consistent 
dose  dependency  for  SBP,  DBP,  and  HR  increases  was  observed.  Importantly,  portions  of  patients  with 
categorical increases in vital signs was consistently highest for the 300 mg dose arm. 
It is noted that the overall incidence of Hypertension / BP increase AEs in the 12-wk OSA population was not 
particularly high (10/353, 2.8%), given the overall physical condition of recruited subjects. On the other side, no 
case of hypertension / BP increase was observed in the placebo arm (N=118).  
Along the same lines with the mean change from baseline in vital signs, dose dependency for Hypertension / BP 
increase  in  12-wk  OSA  population  is  not  clear  across  all  dose  arms.  There  was  no  difference  in  AEs  of 
Hypertension / BP increase between the 37.5 mg and 75 mg on the one side, and the 150 mg and 300 mg arm 
on the other side. Again, however, AE incidence was highest for the higher doses. 
Long-term study 14-005 did not include a placebo group for the full duration of study. Information given for the 
“placebo arm” can only relate to the intermediate 2-wk randomized withdrawal period. Therefore, no meaningful 
control group can help to contextualize the incidence of adverse events. AEs of hypertension/BP increased were 
reported in 22/417 subjects (5.3%) treated with solriamfetol. The majority of these subjects (13/22 [59.1%]) 
had a medical history of BP increased or hypertension and required anti-HTN treatment or modification of their 
current anti-HTN therapy.  
Focussing  on  TEAESIs  of  HR  Increased,  BP  Increased,  and  Palpitations,  a  clear  dose-dependent  increase  in 
incidence  rates  is  observed  in  the  overall  population  (OSA  +  narcolepsy)  in  all  three  cases.  TEAESIs  of  HR 
Increased were related in most cases, however, resolved after a mean duration of 3-20 days. No case was rated 
as severe. Observed cases of BP Increased lasted for longer with a mean duration between 20 and 96 days 
across dose arms. The duration of observed cases of Palpitations was shortest with a mean duration between 2.5 
and 10.5 days. Again, no case of palpitations was rated as severe. 
In summary, it is concluded that for a long-term study an incidence rate of 5.3% (22/417) OSA subjects with 
hypertension / BP increase is not considered unexpectedly high. On the other side, a clear dose dependency was 
observed in study 14-005 for TEAESIs of HR Increased, BP Increased, and Palpitations across the solriamfetol 
dose arms, which is plausible given the dose dependent categorical change in vital signs (BP, HR) observed after 
solriamfetol administration, and the pharmacological mode of action (increasing NE and DA neurotransmission)

of this wake-promoting agent. It is reassuring, however, that the vast majority of BP Increased / hypertension 
AEs was rated as mild and resolved with continued solriamfetol treatment in study 14-005. 
Ischemic Heart Disease and Chest Pain 
Across  all  narcolepsy  and  OSA  studies  (Pool  2),  2  subjects  (0.22%)  had  cardiovascular  events  related  to 
potential ischemic heart disease during exposure to solriamfetol. Both subjects were multi-morbid OSA patients. 
The events were acute myocardial infarction and angina pectoris and were serious for both subjects. No subjects 
discontinued due to ischemic heart disease, however the subject with the SAE of acute myocardial infarction 
later died due to a subsequent adverse event. The other subject (for which a number of independent risk factors 
were confirmed) resumed JZP treatment 3 days after the angina pectoris event. 
The incidence of unspecific chest discomfort was higher (10/517, 1.75%) in the 12-wk study safety population. 
Nine out of ten of these cases were OSA patients. Chest discomfort / Chest pain are labelled in section 4.8. 
In Pool 1, Serious CV events occurred in one subject (0.17%; non cardiac chest pain in a narcolepsy subject), 
compared  to  no  serious  events  in  placebo;  CV  events  leading  to  discontinuation  occurred  in  7/573  (1.2%) 
among solriamfetol treated subjects (all in subjects with OSA except for 1 event of palpitations in a subject with 
narcolepsy), compared with no such event in the placebo group. 
In Pool 2 (all narcolepsy and OSA studies) serious cardiovascular events occurred in 5/935 (0.5%) of subjects, 
all in OSA subjects (Acute myocardial infarction, Atrial fibrillation [2 subjects], Angina pectoris, and Deep vein 
thrombosis). In addition, one SAE of cerebrovascular accident (haemorrhage) occurred in a subject with OSA; a 
further non serious event of aphasia occurred in another subject with OSA.   
As regards to the adverse events positively adjudicated as cardiovascular in Pool 2, 20/935 subjects (2.1%) had 
at least one event: blood pressure increased (8 subjects), hypertension (6 subjects), acute myocardial infarction 
(1  subject),  atrial  fibrillation  (in  3  subjects;  1  prior  to  solriamfetol  exposure),  cerebrovascular  accident, 
pulmonary embolism, ventricular tachycardia (1 subject each). All positively adjudicated CV events occurred in 
subjects with OSA. 
Psychiatric symptoms 
Insomnia / Anxiety 
Like for TEAE insomnia, anxiety (narrow term) and associated symptoms (feeling jittery, irritability, agitation) 
were predominantly observed during treatment initiation and declined with increasing treatment duration. The 
fact that anxiety was also observed in healthy subjects strongly points to a causal relation with solriamfetol’s 
pharmacological mode of action.  Adequate warning notes regarding anxiety / insomnia were included in SmPC 
section 4.4.  
Depression / Suicidality 
Depression is a common co-morbidity both in narcoleptic and OSA patients. In long term study 14-005 94/417 
(22.5%) of OSA patients resp. 60/226 (26.5%) narcoleptic patients reported a medical history of depression. In 
line  with  these  baseline  conditions  the  rate  of  subjects  reporting  depression  /  suicidality  was  higher  in  the 
placebo  group  (2.65%)  as  compared  to  JZP  combined  (1.4%)  in  the  pooled  12-week  studies.  Equally,  the 
portion of subjects of Pool 2 (incl. long term data) presenting with AE depression / suicidality (28/935, 2.99%) 
does  not  point  to  an  increased  risk  due  to  JZP  therapy.  The  C-SSRS  data  did  not  show  suicidal  ideation  or 
behaviour leading up to, or after the attempt.

Psychosis/Psychotic Disorders 
Psychotic  episodes  and  mania  have  been  associated  with  the  use  of  amphetamines  and  were  therefore 
examined in the solriamfetol programme. During the narcolepsy resp. OSA trials there was no signal for AEs 
indicative of psychotic disorders. However, patients with a history of bipolar disorder / psychosis were excluded. 
In healthy PK studies and during study 14-005 there were single well described cases of confabulation resp. 
paranoid symptoms.  
There  was  one  case  of  serious  TEAE  of  bipolar  I  disorder  and  moderate  mania  (manic  behaviour).  The 
investigator’s judgement “not related to study drug” is endorsed. 
Abuse / Misuse / Overdose 
There have been no reports describing individuals who have taken an overdose of solriamfetol in the clinical 
studies. 
In Human Abuse Liability (HAL) study 14-001 JZP doses of 300 mg, 600 mg and 1200 mg were tested. In terms 
of the primary endpoint “Drug Liking at the Moment” all three JZP doses achieved highly significant higher sores 
than  placebo.  If  compared  with  the  positive  control  phentermine  (a  central  stimulant  and  indirect-acting 
sympathomimetic with actions similar to those of dexamfetamine, not approved in Europe) the score was equal 
for both substances, if administered at the highest dose each (phentermine 90 mg, JZP 1200 mg). An abuse 
potential similar or lower as compared to phentermine is concluded. In the US, phentermine is scheduled as 
C-IV, i.e. it has a low potential for abuse (relative to class III drugs), but is currently accepted for medical use. 
Other substances labelled as C-IV in the US, e.g. are benzodiazepines, stimulants (modafinil, sibutramine,), 
tramadol or anorectics (fenfluramine). To contextualize, methyphenidate and morphine are labelled C-II.  A 
paragraph was introduced in SmPC section 4.4 to adequately inform about the potential risk of abuse associated 
with the use of solriamfetol. 
Decreased appetite was reported in 51/251 (20.3%) of healthy volunteers and 86/935 (9.2%) of the narcolepsy 
/ OSA safety population. Phentermine, which was used in the HAL study as positive control and for which a 
similar abuse liability was shown, is approved in the US as anorectic (Adipex®). Monitoring of body weight in 
studies 14-002 resp. 14-003, however, did not point to significant weight loss among included subjects receiving 
solriamfetol as compared to baseline. 
Abrupt cessation of solriamfetol therapy, even after a previous duration of 26-wk treatment, did not lead to any 
signs of drug withdrawal. 
No rebound hypersomnia was observed in those subjects assigned to placebo during the randomized withdrawal 
periods. As could be expected, sleepiness increased as evidenced by higher ESS scores, but ESS score levels 
remained below baseline values both in study 14-004 and 14-005. 
Angle Closure Glaucoma 
Due  to  the  pharmacological  properties  of  solriamfetol  (increasing  NE  signalling),  there  may  be  potential  to 
induce mydriasis and precipitate angle closure glaucoma in predisposed individuals. In all studies in narcolepsy 
and OSA, no TEAEs of acute angle-closure glaucoma were observed in any subjects who received solriamfetol.  
Subjects with a history of glaucoma were not explicitly excluded from clinical trials. Ten (10) included subjects 
(2 narcolepsy and 8 OSA) had a history of glaucoma. Two related events occurred in Study 14-005: One OSA 
subject reported an AE of worsening glaucoma (received no treatment and the event resolved with continuation 
of  study  drug).  Another  OSA  subject  without  prior  relevant  medical  history  reported  1  event  of  ocular 
hypertension (treated with latanoprost while continuing participation in the study).  
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 105/128 
  
  
 
Two TEAEs of mydriasis, which can potentially precipitate or exacerbate acute angle glaucoma, occurred during 
solriamfetol  treatment  (1  in  an  MDD  and  1  in  a  healthy  volunteer  study),  both  of  which  resolved  with 
continuation of study drug.  
The warning proposed for section 4.4 of the SmPC was revised to state that under solriamfetol therapy mydriasis 
may  occur.  Therefore,  caution  is  advised  in  patients  with  increased  ocular  pressure  or  risk  of  angle  closure 
glaucoma. 
Serious Adverse Events / Deaths 
Overall, 38 patients experienced treatment-emergent SAEs among the 1605 patients using solriamfetol. There 
was no pattern in SAE, neither with regard to their nature, nor to the dose received. The overall number of SAE 
was low. The cardiovascular SAEs were primarily reported in subjects with OSA, which is consistent with the high 
prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities in that population. One 70-yr old OSA patient died (also reported 
SAEs bipolar disorder and myocardial infarction) due to sepsis. 
Regarding  safety  population,  comparisons  of  TEAs  per  age  and  BMI  groups  did  not  reveal  any  significant 
increases in TEAE incidence in the elderly and obese populations.  
It is agreed that with regard to safety no dose adjustments are required according to body weight. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall AE profile obtained for solriamfetol mainly concerned psychiatric disorders (symptom complex of 
anxiety,  feeling  jittery  and  irritability),  nervous  system  disorders  (headache,  dry  mouth,  dizziness), 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (nausea,  decreased  appetite,  diarrhoea)  and  influence  on  vital  signs  (BP  and  HR 
increase). In most cases a clear dose-response or tendency towards higher incidence with increasing doses was 
observed. 
For the vast majority of ADRs the incidence was similar across the two disease populations, thereby confirming 
the approach to combine both subgroups into a common safety database. 
Overall exposure is considered adequate and solriamfetol’s safety profile is concluded to align with the one of 
other wake promoting treatment alternatives (e.g. modafinil).  
However, there are uncertainties which are considered to be three-fold. Firstly, patients with bipolar disorders or 
schizophrenia were excluded from the trials. On the other hand, there were single cases of subjects developing 
corresponding  serious  AE  (bipolar  disorder  with  manic  episode,  confabulation).  Therefore,  warnings  were 
implemented in SmPC and the incidence of these disorders’ symptoms should be monitored as an AE of interest 
post-marketing.  
Secondly, no PD interaction studies were conducted. All medications potentially interfering with sleep (sleeping 
aids, wake promotors) were prohibited. Therefore, data on interactions with other CNS active substances are 
sparse.  
Ultimately, the safe use of solriamfetol in the OSA patient population which often present with a history of CV 
events  and  a  number  of  additional  risk  factors  (obesity,  hypertension,  diabetes,  hyperlipidaemia)  was 
thoroughly evaluated. There remain concerns regarding the dose-dependent increase in vital signs (SBP, DBP, 
HR) and associated TEAESIs (dose dependency was most prominent in the long term study 14-005).  
Given the fact, that both (categorical) vital sign changes and the incidence of TEAEs was highest for the highest 
300 mg dose, it is considered that the additional benefit of the 300 mg dose as compared to the second highest 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 106/128 
  
  
 
150 mg dose does not outweigh the associated risks in the OSA population. The maximum daily dose in the OSA 
population is therefore limited to 150 mg once daily. Since measurable efficacy was already observed using the 
lowest 37.5 mg dose, the proposed dose range for the use of solriamfetol in OSA is defined as 37.5 mg to 150 
mg per day.  
Non-adherence resp. incomplete compliance with primary OSA therapy is widespread and largely described in 
the  literature.  Both  compliant  and  non-compliant  subjects  were  included  in  study  14-003.  Throughout  the 
12-week treatment period the use of solriamfetol did not have an impact on the use of primary OSA therapy. 
Based  on  stratified  evaluation  of  efficacy  measures  it  was  shown  that  there  was  no  significant  difference 
between  both  subgroups  in  terms  of  improved  wakefulness  and  sleepiness  over  the  course  of  the  12-week 
treatment period. Overall, with regard to the baseline severity of OSA symptoms, general demographic criteria 
(age,  gender,  BMI),  adherence  resp.  non-adherence  to  primary  OSA  therapy,  and  comorbid  conditions  the 
14-003 study population is considered representative for the general OSA population. Stratified evaluation of 
efficacy measures did not point to significant differences across subgroups. 
Besides the dose reductions to 37.5 mg – 150, other risk minimization measures have been included into the 
SmPC by the Applicant in order to guarantee a safe and appropriate use of solriamfetol. Indeed, the Applicant 
has accepted revisions to the warnings and precautions section of the SmPC with regard to patient selection, 
monitoring, and management of the dose-related effects on BP and HR. 
Furthermore,  patients  enrolled  in  the  OSA  studies  were  additionally  selected  because  the  eligibility  criteria 
excluded patients who had significant CV disease, including but not limited to: “myocardial infarction within the 
past  year,  unstable  angina  pectoris,  symptomatic  congestive  heart  failure  (American  College  of 
Cardiology/American  Heart  Association  stage  C  or  D),  revascularization  procedures  within  the  past  year, 
ventricular  cardiac  arrhythmias  requiring  an  automatic  implantable  cardioverter  defibrillator  (AICD)  or 
medication therapy, uncontrolled hypertension, systolic blood pressure ≥ 155 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 
≥ 95 mmHg (at screening, or consistently across baseline measures according to protocol specifications), or any 
history of CV disease or any significant CV condition that in the Investigator’s opinion could jeopardize subject 
safety in the study”. 
In line with the exclusion criteria applied in study 14-003 conditions like “myocardial infarction within the past 
year, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension, serious cardiac arrhythmias and other serious heart 
problems” were formally listed as contraindications in SmPC section 4.3. 
In the context of reducing the MDD in OSA, the question was also raised for a focused evaluation of the B/R 
balance  for  the  300  mg  dose  in  narcoleptic  patients.  Solriamfetol  is  described  as  a  substance  enhancing 
dopaminergic resp. noradrenergic neurotransmission. In line with its pharmacological profile, there were dose 
dependent  increases  in  vital  signs  (SBP,  DBP,  HR)  in  the  narcolepsy  population  with  the  highest  increases 
observed  for  the  300  mg  dose.  Increases  in  the  means  for  all  3  vital  signs  parameters  also  translated  into 
dose-dependent  increases  in  categorical  vital  sign  changes.  Interpretation  of  categorical  changes,  however, 
should take into account that categorical vital sign increases were also frequently observed in placebo patients 
(e.g. SBP > 5 mm Hg 33-34% in both the placebo and 150 mg dose group; 40.5% for 300 mg). In particular for 
the 300 mg dose group, increases in vital signs (SBP, HR) did not taper shortly after solriamfetol administration 
in the morning but were maintained during daytime (SBP) or even almost the entire 24-hour dosing interval 
(HR). Most importantly, however, it is noted that these increases in vital signs (explainable by solriamfetol’s 
inherent  mode  of  action)  did  not  translate  into  increased  incidence  of  cardiovascular  AEs  in  the  narcoleptic 
population. In pivotal study 14-002 Hypertension / Increased BP was reported by very few subjects without a 
Assessment report

Page 107/128 
  
  
 
 
clear dose relationship (1 placebo, 2/102 subjects receiving 150 mg, 1/99 subject in the 300 mg group). Overall, 
as a further safety measure, the maximum daily dose of solriamfetol for the use in narcolepsy was limited to 150 
mg in accordance with the dose recommendations given in OSA patients. 
Apart from data obtained from abuse liability study 14-001 in recreational drug users, it is noted that there were 
no signs for drug abuse observed in the target population.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 20 March 2019.The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of solriamfetol with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers solriamfetol to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Narcolepsy  is  a  chronic  sleep  disorder  which  affects  the  ability  to  regulate  sleep-wake  cycles  EDS,  typically 
associated with cataplexy (Narcolepsy I) and other REM sleep conditions. The presence of EDS is a defining 
characteristic of narcolepsy and a major diagnostic criterion. The degree of EDS is severe in most patients. OSA 
is a serious disorder characterized by sleep fragmentation caused by repeated arousals secondary to partial or 
complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. Persistent EDS is a major presenting complaint in many 
patients and most patients with OSA awaken in the morning feeling tired and unrefreshed regardless of the 
duration  of  their  time  in  bed.  As  with  narcolepsy,  the  persistent  sleepiness  in  patients  with  OSA  occurs  at 
inappropriate times, for instance while actively conversing, eating, working, and driving (American Academy of 
Sleep Medicine [AASM] 2014). In the presented studies, both narcolepsy and OSA diagnosis were established 
according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 3rd ed. (ICSD-3). For narcolepsy, about every 
second narcoleptic patient included in the pivotal trial 14-002 presented with cataplectic events. 
The  clinical  development  of  solriamfetol  follows  a  symptom-oriented  approach,  intended  to  improve 
wakefulness and reduce EDS. Sunosi film-coated tablets are proposed to improve wakefulness and reduce EDS 
in adult patients with narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) (75-150 mg) or obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) 
(37.5 – 150 mg). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Three  drugs  are  authorized  in  the  EU  for  the  “treatment  of  narcolepsy”  in  adult  patients:  sodium  oxybate 
(Xyrem®) for narcolepsy type I, pitolisant (Wakix®) for narcolepsy types I and II and modafinil (Provigil®) 
considered the first line pharmacological treatment of EDS adult patients with narcolepsy types I or II.  
Currently there are no available pharmacological therapies for treating EDS in patients with OSA in the EU. In 
OSA,  positive  airway  pressure  (PAP)  applied  through  a  nasal,  oral,  or  oronasal  interface  during  sleep  is 
considered to be the reference standard treatment by the European Respiratory Society (Fietze et al, 2011; 
Randerath et al, 2011) with the aim to stabilize the upper airway. During clinical trials solriamfetol was used in 
OSA patients with previous or current use of cPAP. As a wake-promoting agent solriamfetol is not suitable to 
treat underlying airway obstruction in OSA. Sunosi is not designed as a substitute, but an addition of primary 
cPAP therapy. 
Pathological  EDS  often  continues  despite  primary  treatment  of  the  airway  obstruction  with  positive  airway 
pressure or other therapies (Gay et al. 2006; Fietze et al. 2011; and Randerath et al. 2011). When PAP is not 
accepted  by  the  patient  or  when  it  is  not  tolerable  or  effective,  alternative  therapies  used  for  the  primary 
treatment of OSA may include behavioural therapy, or surgical intervention (Epstein et al, 2009; Randerath et 
al, 2011). 
Overall, it is concluded that solriamfetol could potentially add to the array of available treatment options in 
narcoleptic patients (oxybate, pitolisant, modafinil) and could constitute the first medication approved to reduce

EDS in OSA patients. While oxybate (GABA-ergic mechanism) and pitolisant (selective histamine H3 antagonist 
/  inverse  agonist)  represent  distinct  pharmacological  profiles,  there  may  be  more  similarities  between  the 
molecular mode of action between modafinil and solriamfetol.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A comprehensive phase III study programme was undertaken. The primary evidence of solriamfetol’s efficacy 
was  derived  from  two  pivotal  randomized,  double-blind  placebo-controlled  12-week  trials:  study  14-002  in 
narcolepsy (N=239, randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive fixed-dose JZP 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg or placebo) and 
study 14-003 in OSA (N=476, randomized 1:1:2:2:2 to receive fixed-dose JZP 37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 
mg, or placebo). 
Apart from the use of different stratification factor (presence or absence of cataplexy for 14-002 and subjects’ 
compliant or noncompliant use of their primary OSA therapy for 14-003) and an additional low-dose arm in 
study 14-003, both studies were identical in design. The two pivotal trials were complemented by the 6-week, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal study 14-004 in OSA (N=174; 2-wk individual dose 
titration, 2-wk stable dose treatment, 2-wk randomized withdrawal). 
While  narcoleptic  and  OSA  patients  were  separately  examined  during  the  preceding  phase  2/3  studies,  the 
combined disease populations could enter into a 40- or 52-week open-label extension study (14-005) of JZP 75, 
150, 300 mg (including an initial 2-wk titration period and a 2-wk, double-blind, randomized withdrawal period 
after about 26 weeks of open label treatment). 
The  population  chosen  in the  pivotal  trials  is  representative  of  narcoleptic  or  OSA  patients  according  to  the 
International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3). Included patients presented with moderate to severe 
EDS, as evidenced by their ESS scores at baseline.  
Narcolepsy patients were stratified for presence of cataplectic events (around 50% at baseline), OSA patients 
were  stratified  for  compliance  (approx.  70%)  vs  non-compliance  with  primary  OSA  therapy  (i.e.  PAP). 
Throughout the trials primary OSA therapy was allowed to be continued, however, any medication interfering 
with sleep (stimulants, amphetamines, hypnotics, sodium oxybate, modafinil etc.) had to be washed out before 
study entry. Subjects were excluded if presenting with significant cardiovascular disease, bipolar related and 
other psychiatric (apart from depression) disorders (incl. suicidal ideation). 
The efficacy of solriamfetol in reducing EDS and improving wakefulness throughout the day was demonstrated 
using  both  objective  (MWT,  polysomnographic  incl.  EEG  recording,  in  minutes,  lower  values  indicating 
decreased  ability  to  stay  awake  in  soporific  ambiance)  and  subjective  measures  including  both  the  ESS 
(self-administered questionnaire to reflect the patient’s propensity to fall asleep in 8 typical everyday situations, 
scale 0-24, higher values pointing to higher sleepiness), and the PGIc scale (key secondary endpoint). MWT and 
ESS were defined as co-primary endpoints. The efficacy measures are validated in both patient populations and 
were adequately chosen.  
The  pivotal trials  14-002 and  14-003  were  complemented  by  6-week  randomized  withdrawal  study  14-004. 
Contrary  to  studies  14-002  and  14-003,  which  followed  a  fixed  dose  arm  design,  subjects  in  study  14-004 
titrated solriamfetol individually over the first two weeks of treatment. Long-term maintenance of efficacy was 
examined in 1-yr extension study 14-005, which primarily was designed as open-label. Following FDA advice, a 
2-wk intermittent double-blind randomized withdrawal period after 26-week open label treatment was included 
with Protocol Amendment 3, thereby increasing clinical meaningfulness of study 14-005 in terms of efficacy.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
In narcolepsy study 14-002, for the co-primary MWT and ESS efficacy endpoints (change from baseline) a clear 
dose-dependent effect was observed delivering highly significant (p < 0.0001) superiority over placebo for the 
150 mg and 300 mg dose arm. As concerns MWT, in both arms patients achieved maintenance of wakefulness 
more than twice as long as compared to baseline (150 mg: from 7.85 min at baseline to 17.67 min at week 12; 
300 mg: from 8.73 min at baseline 19.91 min at week 12 [means]). Also for the lowest JZP 75 mg dose arm, 
maintained  wakefulness  improved,  however,  the  change  from  baseline  does  not  significantly  separate  from 
placebo (change from baseline [min]: placebo 2.12, JZP 75 mg: 4.74 [-1.04, 6.28; p=0.1595]).  
For the co-primary ESS endpoint, in absolute figures, the decline in subjective, self-assessed propensity to fall 
asleep in typical everyday situations was more modest, however, still highly significant over placebo for the two 
higher doses EDS (150mg: from 17.0 ESS score at baseline to 11.5 ESS score at week 12; 300mg from 17.2 ESS 
score at baseline to 11.1 ESS score at week 12.) 
The  clinical  relevance  of  the  achieved  difference  over  placebo  was  underlined  by  post-hoc  cumulative 
distribution analyses for ESS demonstrating that only 15.5% of placebo patients achieved an ESS score < 10, 
however, the rate was doubled in the 75 mg dose arm (30.5%) and more than tripled for the highest 300 mg 
dose (49.2%). 
In OSA study 14-003, baseline disease severity in terms of ESS (14.8 -15.6 min) and MWT-MSLT (12.00 – 
13.64 min) was less pronounced as compared to the narcolepsy population of study 14-002. 
For the two co-primary MWT and ESS efficacy endpoints (change from baseline) a dose-dependent effect was 
observed delivering significant superiority over placebo for the 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg dose arms. In these 
3 arms patients achieved maintenance of wakefulness about twice as long as compared to baseline (75 mg: 
from 12.44 min at baseline to 21.79 min at week 12; 150 mg: from 12.54 min to 23.64 min; 300 mg: from 12.10 
min to 25.28 min at week 12 [means]). Also, for the lowest JZP 37.5 mg dose arm (proposed as starting dose 
in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment),  maintained  wakefulness  improved  significantly  (change  from 
baseline [min]: placebo 0.21, JZP 37.5 mg: 4.74 [1.16, 7.90; p=0.0086]).  
Hence, results for MWT in the OSA population were overall more positive as compared to the results obtained in 
narcoleptic patients (study 14-002: 75 mg dose arm did significantly separate from placebo).  
Post-hoc  cumulative  distribution  analysis  demonstrated  that  placebo  response  (in  terms  of  ESS)  was  more 
pronounced in OSA patients as compared to narcoleptic patients. While in study 14-002 only 15.5% of subjects 
allocated to placebo achieved ESS scores < 10, the respective portion of OSA subjects receiving placebo was 
37.7%. On the other side, the treatment effect in JZP dose groups was also higher for OSA patients: In study 
14-003, more than 70% of subjects receiving 150 mg resp. 300 mg JZP achieved ESS scores < 10. 
Robustness of the results for the co-primary endpoint of both pivotal studies was shown by calculating a set of 
four sensitivity analyses, largely confirming the results obtained with the primary MMRM method. 
As regards a potential influence of JZP on the number of cataplectic events in narcolepsy patients, there was no 
consistent  pattern  across  dose  arms.  It  is  therefore  rather  unlikely  that  there  is  a  clear  positive  impact  of 
solriamfetol on the cataplectic attack frequency. On the other hand, there is no signal that cataplexy may be 
negatively influenced by solriamfetol treatment.

MWT testing is time-consuming, it spans over approximately 9 hours post-administration since the five testing 
sessions (up to 40 min duration per session) are separated by 2-hours intervals. Looking separately at the 5 
consecutive testing sessions per day, for the 150 mg and 300 mg dose arm the difference over placebo remains 
significant for each of the five sessions. There is no clear sign for a declining effect over the course of the testing 
day.  
In both pivotal trials, for both primary efficacy endpoints the main effect is achieved within the first week of 
treatment.  Thereafter  the effect  is  maintained  in  a dose-related  manner  over the  entire  12-week  treatment 
period. Furthermore, in both populations the study outcome in terms of the key secondary PGIc endpoint fully 
goes along with the results for the MWT and ESS co-primary endpoints. 
Results  obtained  from  the  two  pivotal  studies  are  complemented  by  6-week  randomized  withdrawal  study 
14-004. Solriamfetol was individually titrated to an efficacious and tolerable dose in study 14-004, which is 
considered to provide valuable information for clinical practice. Starting with 75 mg once daily, the patient could 
escalate the dose by one dose step every 3 days up to a maximum of 300 mg once daily. Dose titration was 
successfully completed by 90.2% (157/174) of included subjects. More than every second subject completing 
the titration period (84/157, 53.5%) titrated up to the highest 300 mg dose (150 mg: 50/157, 31.8%; 75 mg: 
23/157, 14.6%). After further 2 weeks of stable dose treatment subjects presenting with a positive treatment 
effect at week 4 (“much” or “very much improved” on PGIc plus numerical improvements in terms of MWT and 
ESS) were eligible for entering the randomized withdrawal period. 
Subjects who continued to receive solriamfetol in the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase maintained the treatment 
benefits noted at Week 4, with little change in mean sleep latency (-0.96 minutes) and minimal change in ESS 
score (-0.1; for all JZP dose arms combined). In contrast, the placebo group showed a mean reduction of 12.11 
(1.316) minutes in mean sleep latency and a 4.5 increase in ESS score at the end of the Double-blind Withdrawal 
Phase, resulting in statistically significant LS mean differences of 11.16 minutes on the MWT and -4.6 on the ESS 
(p < 0.0001 for both measures). 
After abrupt treatment cessation, the ability to maintain wakefulness and daytime sleepiness worsen, however, 
no rebound hypersomnia was noticed. Values for MWT and ESS at the end of the randomized withdrawal period 
are still favourable, if compared with baseline at study entry. 
There were no signs of withdrawal symptoms. 
Maintenance of effect was demonstrated in long term extension study 14-005 in both the narcoleptic (226/643, 
35.1%) and OSA (417/643, 64.9%) subpopulations. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  clinical  development  programme  of  solriamfetol  did  not  include  an  active  comparator  arm.  While  no 
medication is approved to reduce EDS in OSA patients, the inclusion of an active comparator would have been 
useful for a better contextualization of efficacy and safety results in narcoleptic patients. However, the CHMP 
agrees that comprehensive clinical data under placebo control are at hand that suffice to strike the benefit risk 
balance. 
No dose-response data were provided informing about sub- or supra-therapeutic doses in the target population. 
However, doses tested during phase II study ADX-N05 202 were taken over into phase III (150 mg, 300 mg) 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 117/128 
  
  
 
 
and  delivered  efficacy  results  superior  over  placebo.  As  regards  safety,  data  on  supra-therapeutic  doses 
(obtained from PK and MDD studies) were provided. 
In terms of the co-primary endpoint MWT, numerical improvements over placebo were shown, however, not 
significant, for the 75 mg lowest dose arm in narcolepsy study 14-002. In OSA study 14-003, however, MWT 
results for the 75 mg dose arm were highly significant. Significance was also achieved for the lowest 37.5 mg 
dose arm (MWT, p=0.0086; 37.5 mg is proposed as starting dose in subjects with OSA). Furthermore, in study 
14-002 the 75 mg dose arm delivered significant results for the other co-primary endpoint (ESS, p=0.0211). 
Given the fact that solriamfetol is proposed to be individually titrated according to efficacy and tolerability, the 
non-significant MWT result for the 75 mg dose arm in study 14-002 is of low concern. 
In absolute figures, ESS results were more favourable in OSA as compared to narcolepsy patients. Throughout 
the entire timespan from baseline of the parent study to baseline of study 14-005, and the titration effect until 
the end of the 40-wk open label phase, ESS scores in narcoleptic subjects were higher as compared to OSA 
subjects. This, however, was not considered to question the efficacy of solriamfetol in narcolepsy patients, since 
for improvement of EDS significant (75 mg) or highly significant (150 mg, 300 mg) placebo superiority was 
shown in the pivotal narcolepsy trial (14-002). 
Subjects with moderate or severe OSA on the baseline PSG were excluded from participation in narcolepsy study 
14-002, in order to uniquely demonstrate efficacy in narcoleptic patients (and not in mixed clinical conditions). 
However, in up to 25.4% of included subjects (150 mg arm) sleep apnoea syndrome was reported (percentages 
were lower in other doses: 18.6% for 75 mg and 11.9% in the 300 mg arms). 
Solriamfetol shares mood increasing properties; however, factors in the assessment of ES, such as depression 
for both the conditions and fatigue in OSA were not taken into account in the evaluation of treatment effect. In 
particular, results on the PGIc endpoint may be related not only to the effect on ES but also confounded by an 
effect on mood. 
The recommended starting dose is 75 mg once daily in narcolepsy and 37.5 mg in OSA patients. Depending on 
clinical response, the dosage can be titrated to a higher level by doubling the dose at intervals of at least 3 days. 
Studies 14-002 and 14-003 followed a fixed dose arm design. Solriamfetol was titrated in studies 14-004 and 
14-005. In study 14-004, however, ESS was only recorded at the beginning and the end of the 2-week initial 
titration process. It is therefore unclear how up- or down-titration could be efficacy-driven given the schedule of 
assessment.  From  the  wording  of  the  titration  process  in  the  study  14-005  Protocol,  “investigators  were 
instructed  to  titrate  to  the  maximum  dose  that  was  tolerated  to  maximize  therapeutic  efficacy”,  this  would 
correspond to a dose escalation scheme rather than dose titration.  
Given the fact, that both (categorical) vital sign changes and the incidence of TEAEs (see unfavourable effects 
below) was highest for the highest 300 mg dose, the question arises for the additional benefit of the 300 mg 
dose as compared to the second highest 150 mg dose.  
In the OSA pivotal trial (14-003) the response was dose dependent, however, in particular in terms of the ESS 
co-primary endpoint the difference between the 150 mg and the 300 mg dose arm was modest: mean ESS 
scores after 12 weeks of treatment were decreased to 7.5 resp. 7.1 with the 150 mg resp. 300 mg dose. 
For the responder analysis, the portion of subjects achieving an ESS score < 10, the difference between the two 
dose arms was small (70.0% resp. 73.0% for the 150 mg resp. 300 mg dose).  
For the second MWT co-primary endpoint the difference between the two highest doses is clearer, however, it is 
noted, that in both dose arms (and also in the 75 mg dose arm) the MWT score is > 19.4, which is considered 
the minimum wakefulness score in healthy subjects according to the literature. 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 118/128 
  
  
 
It  is  concluded,  that  although  efficacy  results  in  OSA  patients  were  largely  dose  dependent,  the  additional 
benefit (in terms of ESS, MWT, responder analysis) obtained from the highest 300 mg dose as compared to the 
second highest 150 mg dose in only modest.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall exposure is considered adequate. N=1605 unique subjects were exposed (thereof healthy volunteers, 
MDD  patients  from  a  previous  clinical  trial  programme  and  N=935  subjects  of  the  OSA  /  narcolepsy  target 
population). Exposure was at least 6 months for 531 subjects and at least 12 months for 281 subjects. Broken 
down to minimum requirements on patient exposure over one year per subpopulation, 95 narcoleptic and 186 
OSA patients received solriamfetol for > 12 months. 
Baseline characteristics in terms of age, sex, BMI and co-morbidities are considered to typically represent the 
target  OSA  and  narcoleptic  subpopulations.  Obesity  is  common  among  OSA  patients,  as  reflected  by  the 
baseline  BMI  in  recruited  OSA  patients  (33-34  kg/m2).  Apart  from  the  high  BMI  value,  OSA  patients  often 
present with medical history suggestive of metabolic syndrome. A considerably higher portion of recruited OSA 
subjects  (as  compared  to  narcolepsy)  received  concomitant  antihypertensive  medication,  lipid  modifying 
agents, antidiabetics and insulin. 
While subjects with bipolar disorders or schizophrenia were excluded from phase III studies, about a quarter of 
subjects included in pivotal studies 14-002 (25.8%), 14-003 (23.1%) and long-term study 14-005 presented 
with comorbid depression (narcolepsy 26.5%, OSA 22.5%).  
In  the  studies  in  narcolepsy  and  OSA,  the  SOCs  with  the  highest  incidence  of  AEs  were  Gastrointestinal 
Disorders,  Nervous  System  Disorders,  Psychiatric  Disorders,  and  Infections  and  Infestations;  except  for 
Infections and Infestations, the incidence in these SOCs was higher with solriamfetol than with placebo in the 
12-week studies. 
The summary of AEs per SOC, disease subpopulation and treatment duration showed a general tendency for 
higher AE incidence in the narcoleptic population as compared to OSA patients (with the most striking difference 
for Nervous System Disorders: Pool 1: narcolepsy 27.27%, OSA 16.71). 
Cardiac disorders (SOC 3-times elevated over placebo) mainly refer to palpitations and increase of heart rate. 
The higher incidence of SOC Psychiatric Disorders reflects the symptom complex of anxiety, feeling jittery and 
irritability. Nervous System Disorders mainly correspond to headache, dry mouth and dizziness. Further groups 
of AEs occurring more often in JZP treatment (as compared to placebo) concern the gastrointestinal system 
(nausea 9.25%, decreased appetite 9.08%, diarrhoea 5.24%, constipation 2.09%), respiratory tract infections 
(nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, cough) and bone / muscle related AEs (arthralgia, muscle spasms, myalgia).  
Broken  down to  the  four dose  levels  of  JZP  examined  throughout  the  12-wk  trials,  there  was  either  a  clear 
dose-response relationship for AEs (headache, decreased appetite, anxiety, diarrhoea, dry mouth), a tendency 
towards higher incidence with increasing dose (nausea, insomnia, dizziness, feeling jittery, heart rate increased) 
or  no  dose  response  relation  discernible  (nasopharyngitis,  palpitations,  sinusitis,  constipation,  arthralgia, 
muscle spasms). 
Adverse  events  of  interest  (e.g.  depression  /  suicidality,  anxiety  /  irritability,  cardiovascular  effects,  angle 
closure  glaucoma),  the  abuse  potential  and  intrinsic  /  extrinsic  factors  potentially  requiring  particular  dose 
recommendations were adequately addressed.

Overall,  solriamfetol’s  safety  profile  is  concluded  to  align  with  the  one  of  other  wake  promoting  treatment 
alternatives (e.g. modafinil).  
Vital sign measurement (BP, HR) was undertaken within three different testing settings (at each clinical study 
visit [with no relationship to dosing time], through multiple sequential measurements on MWT testing days [at 
fixed times relative to dosing], and through 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) while subjects were in 
the outpatient environment with no relationship to dosing time). Thereby, a comprehensive data package was 
provided. 
Across the vital sign change categories, almost consistent dose dependency for SBP, DBP, and HR increases was 
observed. Importantly, portions of patients with categorical increases in vital signs was consistently highest for 
the 300 mg dose arm. 
Summaries  of  TEAESI  by  dose  level  and  disease  population  of  study  14-005  were  provided.  Focussing  on 
TEAESIs of HR Increased, BP Increased, and Palpitations, a clear dose-dependent increase in incidence rates is 
observed in the overall population (OSA + narcolepsy) in all three cases.  
In long-term study 14-005 an incidence rate of 5.3% (22/417) OSA subjects with hypertension / BP increase 
was  observed,  which  is  not  considered  unexpectedly  high.  On  the  other  side, a  clear  dose  dependency was 
observed in study 14-005 for TEAESIs of HR Increased, BP Increased, and Palpitations across the solriamfetol 
dose arms, which is plausible given the dose dependent categorical change in vital signs (BP, HR) observed after 
solriamfetol administration, and the pharmacological mode of action (increasing NE and DA neurotransmission) 
of this wake-promoting agent.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A very comprehensive data package was provided regarding monitoring of vital sign changes and the potential 
association  with  TEAESIs.  Uncertainty  about  unfavourable  CV  effects  (in  particular  in  OSA  patients)  is  not 
caused by a lack of data within the constraints of a maximum of a 1-year long term observation period. 
To some degree, instead, interpretation of the clinical implications of the observed increases in BP and HR is 
compromised by concerns about the representativeness of the recruited OSA population, since subjects with 
present significant CV disease were excluded from the phase III studies. This, however, is acceptable within the 
given  clinical  trial  scenario.  Respective  warning  statements  alert  the  prescribing  physician  on  the  use  of 
solriamfetol in patients with unstable CV disease, serious heart arrhythmias and other serious heart problems. 
Patients with bipolar disorders or schizophrenia were excluded from the trials. On the other hand, there were 
single  cases  of  subjects  developing  corresponding  serious  AE  (bipolar  disorder  with  manic  episode, 
confabulation).  Therefore,  respective  patients  with  a  history  of  bipolar  disorder  were  not  proposed  to  be 
contraindicated and respective warnings were implemented instead. 
No PD interaction studies were conducted. While in particular OSA patients presented with an extensive list of 
concomitant  medication  (antihypertensives,  antidiabetics,  lipid  modifying  agents  etc.),  all  medications 
potentially  interfering  with  sleep  (sleeping  aids,  wake  promotors)  were  prohibited.  Therefore,  data  on  PD 
interactions with other CNS active substances are sparse.  
Dopamine  and  noradrenaline  have  been  implicated  in  the  physiological/pathophysiological  regulation  of  the 
activity  of  the  HPA  axis.  Inhibitors  of  dopamine  and  noradrenaline  reuptake  in  the  CNS  (like  cocaine  and 
amphetamines) have been shown to activate the HPA axis and this effect has been considered to be involved in

the increased morbidity and mortality rate associated with the (chronic) application of these drugs. The question 
whether solriamfetol activates the HPA axis is therefore not trivial. While the available nonclinical data were not 
considered sufficient to allow for definite conclusions concerning an activation of the HPA axis by solriamfetol, 
they raise considerable concern. Clinical data concerning effects of solriamfetol on main components of the HPA 
axis (i.e. CRH, vasopressin, ACTH, cortisol) are not available.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A  symptom-oriented  approach  is  followed  in  solriamfetol’s  clinical  development  programme,  intended  to 
improve wakefulness and reduce EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnoea. Efficacy was 
measured using meaningful clinical co-primary endpoints (objective MWT [incl. EEG recording] and subjective 
self-assessed ESS). The observed clinical benefit is considered relevant across both sub-populations and was 
shown  to  be  robust.  Other  clinical  symptoms  of  narcolepsy  (e.g.  the  number  of  cataplectic  events)  were

unaffected  by  solriamfetol  treatment,  thereby  confirming  the  symptom-oriented  approach.  Similarly,  the 
symptomatic  treatment  of  EDS  with  solriamfetol  would  not  affect  the  pathophysiology  of  OSA  being  upper 
airway  obstruction  the  leading  cause  of  hypoxia  and  hypercapnia  during  sleep  -important  determinants  of 
daytime ES- and increased CV risk.  
The  target  populations  were  adequately  chosen.  Improvement  in  EDS  was  observed  early  after  treatment 
initiation within 1-2 weeks and was shown to be maintained over (at least) one year. Initially solriamfetol was 
proposed to be used with a maximum daily dose of 300 mg in both conditions. Based on considerations about the 
balance between the added benefit of the 300 mg dose (as compared to the second highest 150 mg dose) on the 
one side and the associated safety risks on the other side, the Applicant agreed to limit the dose ranges to 37.5 
– 150 mg in OSA and  75 - 150 mg in narcolepsy. 
Solriamfetol molecular mode of action is described as being based on selective dopamine and norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibition (DNRI), thereby leading to enhanced dopaminergic resp. noradrenergic signalling. As could 
therefore be expected, the overall AE profile obtained for solriamfetol mainly concerned psychiatric disorders 
(symptom complex of anxiety, feeling jittery and irritability), nervous system disorders (headache, dry mouth, 
dizziness), gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhoea) and influence on vital signs (slight 
HR increase). In most cases a clear dose-response or tendency towards higher incidence with increasing doses 
was observed. 
Cardiac disorders (SOC 3-times elevated over placebo) mainly refer to palpitations and increase of heart rate. 
Abuse potential for solriamfetol was shown in recreational drug users. In the target population, however, there 
were no signs for abuse. After abrupt treatment cessation in two randomized trials, no signs for drug withdrawal 
were observed. 
Adverse  events  of  interest  (e.g.  depression  /  suicidality,  anxiety  /  irritability,  cardiovascular  effects,  angle 
closure  glaucoma),  the  abuse  potential  and  intrinsic  /  extrinsic  factors  potentially  requiring  particular  dose 
recommendations were adequately addressed.  
With regard to the OSA subpopulation, treatment with PAP or other therapies (e.g. oral appliances, surgical 
procedures)  is  considered  primary  therapy  to  treat  the  underlying  airway  obstruction  and  to  reduce  EDS. 
However, there is a proportion of patients that continue to suffer from pathological EDS for multiple causes, 
probably related to residual hypoxia- and/or sleep fragmentation, despite an optimized primary therapy of the 
airway  obstruction  or  because  of  the  need  to  interrupt  the  primary  OSA  therapy  for  reasons  related  to 
intolerance or non-compliance. The OSA population examined in the clinical trial programme contained both 
patients adherent or non-adherent to primary OSA therapy and was stratified accordingly. 
It is therefore concluded that baseline severity of OSA symptoms, general demographic criteria (age, gender, 
BMI),  adherence  or  non-adherence  to  primary  OSA  therapy,  and  comorbid  conditions  in  the  14-003  study 
population are considered representative for the general OSA population. Statistically significant and clinically 
relevant improvement of wakefulness and reduction of EDS was shown in the studied OSA population. Stratified 
evaluation of efficacy measures did not point to significant differences across subgroups. A subpopulation with 
an expected more pronounced benefit could not be identified.  
The narcolepsy population was substantially younger (narcolepsy ~36 years vs OSA ~54 years), of lower body 
mass  index  (narcolepsy  ~28-29,  OSA  ~33),  and  had  a  lower  rate  of  comorbidities  related  to  hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes mellitus as compared to the OSA population. This is also reflected by the lower 
percentage of narcoleptic subjects receiving concomitant medications for these conditions as compared to the 
OSA  population.  Also,  the  recruited  narcolepsy  patients  are  considered  representative  in  terms  of  disease 
severity. Given the differences in medical history (e.g. hypertension: narcolepsy 16.9-20.3%, OSA 48.7-50.4%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/686622/2019 
Page 122/128 
  
  
 
and other general demographic factors (BMI etc.) it is acknowledged that narcoleptic patients are less prone to 
CV risks as compared to OSA patients. 
Statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in terms of maintained wakefulness and reduction of 
EDS was shown in the narcolepsy population. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, it is concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks in both the OSA (37.5 mg to 150 mg) and narcolepsy 
(75 mg to 150 mg per day dose range) subpopulations. Apart from the revised dose range, this conclusion is to 
be  seen  in  the  context  of  revisions  implemented  in sections  4.1,  4.3  and  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  In  line  with  the 
exclusion criteria applied in study 14-003 and given the observed CV risk profile of solriamfetol conditions like 
“myocardial infarction within the past year, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension, serious cardiac 
arrhythmias and other serious heart problems” were formally listed as contraindications (4.3).  
In  the  clinical  trials  OSA  patients  were  included  either  adherent  or  non-adherent  to  standard  OSA  therapy 
intended to prevent airway obstruction, e.g. CPAP. The use of solriamfetol as a symptomatic treatment approach 
is indicated only in those patients with OSA that are not satisfactorily treated by primary OSA therapy, such as 
continuous  positive  airway  pressure  (CPAP).  The  indication  wording  in  SmPC  section  4.1  was  revised 
accordingly. 
Furthermore, in SmPC section 4.2 it is stated that Sunosi is not a therapy for the underlying airway obstructions 
and that primary OSA therapy should be maintained in these patients.  
At  the  top  of  SmPC  section  4.2  information  was  included  to  alert  the  prescribing  physician  to  assess  blood 
pressure and heart rate before initiating treatment with solriamfetol. Likewise, the patient is to be monitored 
during treatment and the need for continued treatment is to be assessed periodically. 
The  revised  and  strengthened  warning  notes  on  the  risks  of  BP  elevations  and  associated  requirements  to 
thoroughly examine the patient before treatment initiation and throughout treatment apply to both narcoleptic 
and OSA patients.  
In essence, it is concluded that the B/R balance of Sunosi for improvement of wakefulness and reduction of 
excessive daytime sleepiness is positive in both disease populations given the risk minimization measures as 
specified above.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Sunosi is not similar to Wakix within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority decision (30 
out of 32 votes) that the benefit-risk balance of Sunosi is favourable in the following indication: 
Sunosi is indicated to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in adult patients  with 
narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy). 
Sunosi is indicated to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adult patients 
with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) whose EDS has not been satisfactorily treated by primary OSA therapy, 
such  as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 14 November 2019 
Sunosi EMEA/H/C/004893/0000 
The  undersigned  members  of  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  positive  opinion  recommending  the 
granting of the marketing authorisation of Sunosi (solriamfetol) for the indication improving wakefulness and 
reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) whose EDS has not 
been satisfactorily treated by primary OSA therapy, such  as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). 
The reasons for the divergent opinion are the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The documented symptomatic benefits of solriamfetol in the dose range of 75 mg to 150 mg for the 
management of OSA does not outweigh its potential risks, following concerns over its safety; apparent 
cardiovascular side effects in terms of increased blood pressure and heart rate; 
the currently available data on the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events is based on a relatively 
healthy patient population, and cannot be extrapolated to the patient population at large that would 
receive solriamfetol, even with the proposed contraindications in place; 
nevertheless that solriamfetol is currently contraindicated in patients with a myocardial infarction within 
the  past  year,  unstable  angina  pectoris,  uncontrolled  hypertension,  serious  cardiac  arrhythmias  and 
other serious heart problems, an increased risk can also apply to patients with OSA to be treated with 
solriamphetol following the approved indication. Obstructive sleep apnea in itself is an important risk 
factor for cardiovascular disease, and patients with OSA are likely to be at risk of cardiovascular disease.  
the applicant did propose measures to reduce this risk, but the measures are considered difficult to 
implement in practice.  The proposed contraindications and warnings are considered insufficient to 
adequately control the risk of cardiovascular events; 
finally, it is highly questionable if more information on the risk of CV events can be achieved from the 
proposed PASS to evaluate long-term safety of solriamfetol in adult patients with OSA  taking into 
consideration the observational nature of the study, conducted in routine clinical practice, and the low 
incidence rate of major adverse cardiovascular events.  
For the aforementioned reasons, the marketing authorisation application is considered to be not approvable.

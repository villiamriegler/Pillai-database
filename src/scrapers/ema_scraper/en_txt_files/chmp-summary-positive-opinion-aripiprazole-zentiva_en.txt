Summary of opinion 1 (initial authorisation) 
Aripiprazole Zentiva 
aripiprazole 
On 23 April 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, 
recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Aripiprazole Zentiva, 
intended for the treatment of schizophrenia as well as treatment and prevention of manic episodes in bipolar 
I disorder. The applicant for this medicinal product is Zentiva, k.s. 
Aripiprazole Zentiva will be available as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablets and 5 mg, 10 mg, 
15 mg and 30 mg tablets.  
The active substance of Aripiprazole Zentiva is aripiprazole, an antipsychotic medicine (ATC code: N05AX12). 
Its exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it acts as a partial agonist, attaching to several different 
receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin on the surface of nerve cells in the brain. This 
action disrupts signals transmitted between brain cells by these neurotransmitters, and thereby helps to 
normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing them from 
returning. 
Aripiprazole Zentiva is a generic of Abilify, which has been authorised in the EU since June 2004. Studies 
have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Aripiprazole Zentiva, and its bioequivalence to the reference 
product Abilify. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here. 
The full indication is:  
"Aripiprazole Zentiva is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 
years and older. 
Aripiprazole Zentiva is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder 
and for the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes and

Aripiprazole Zentiva is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in 
Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older (see section 5.1).”

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for temozolomide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Sepsis is the second most frequent infection. During the reporting interval 34 cases of sepsis 
including associated terms (e.g. neutropenic sepsis, urosepsis) were reported in the post-
marketing setting. Due to its severity and considering that less severe and less frequent infections 
such as upper respiratory infection, sinusitis or wound infection are labelled, the PRAC considered 
that sepsis should be included in the product information and not merged under the event 
‘infections’. Based on the available evidence, the PRAC concluded that ‘sepsis’ should be included 
with an uncommon frequency in section 4.8 of the SmPC and in section 4 of the Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for temozolomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing temozolomide is unchanged subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

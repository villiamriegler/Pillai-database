1.  Introduction 
On 23 May 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric clinical study C38072-AS-30027 for 
reslizumab (Cinqaero), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure EMEA/H/C/003912/P46/008. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that C38072-AS-30027 was part of a clinical development program for a subcutaneous 
formulation of reslizumab for which an extension application was planned for submission in May 2018. 
Since the extension application is no longer proceeding as planned, this study report is being submitted 
as a standalone study. 
A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Reslizumab solution for subcutaneous (sc) injection (110 mg/mL in a prefilled syringe) is being 
developed for eosinophilic asthma in adolescent and adult patients. Study C38072/1107 evaluated the 
bioavailability of reslizumab sc compared to reslizumab iv in healthy subjects. A Phase 1 study in 
healthy adult subjects (C38072 PK 10071) was conducted to assess dose proportionality of sc 
reslizumab following single doses of 55, 110, and 220 mg, and to assess for effect of injection site 
(upper arm, abdomen, thigh) on the pharmacokinetics of sc reslizumab.  
Two placebo-controlled phase 3 efficacy and safety studies of reslizumab 110 mg sc, administered 
every 4 weeks (q4w) in patients with eosinophilic asthma ≥12 years of age, have completed clinical 
conduct and Clinical Study Reports are in preparation (Studies C38072 AS-30025 and C38072-AS-
30027). Eligible patients who complete these 2 studies have the opportunity to enter an open label, 36 
week extension study (C38072 AS 30066). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Reslizumab (CEP-38072) is a humanized anti-human interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody (anti-IL-5 
mAb). Reslizumab works by binding to IL-5 and preventing its binding to the IL-5 receptor, thereby 
reducing circulating and tissue eosinophils. 
Reslizumab injection for intravenous (iv) administration was first approved via the centralized 
procedure in the European Union under the tradename CINQAERO® on 16 August 2016, as add-on 
therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose 
inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.  
In this application, results of subcutaneaous (sc) reslizumab in patients from 12 years of age were 
presented in the clinical study report of Study C38072-AS-30027. The MAH stated that Study C38072-
AS-30027 is a stand-alone study.

No data for adolescents became available as the only one adolescents included was randomised to 
placebo group.  
The study was not part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan according to the European Medicines 
Agency Decision P/0010/2018, dated 30 January 2018 on the acceptance of a modification of an 
agreed paediatric investigation plan for reslizumab (CINQAERO), (EMEA-001202-PIP02-13-M02).

Clinical study number and title 
Study C38072-AS-30027:  
Phase 3, 24-Week, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Efficacy and Safety Study of 
Reslizumab Subcutaneous Dosing (110 mg Every 4 Weeks) in Patients with Oral Corticosteroid 
Dependent Asthma and Elevated Blood Eosinophils; 
Description 
Study C38072-AS-30027 is a Phase 3, 24-Week, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, 
Efficacy and Safety Study of Reslizumab Subcutaneous Dosing (110 mg Every 4 Weeks) in Patients 
with Oral Corticosteroid Dependent Asthma and Elevated Blood Eosinophils.  
The study was conducted at 78 centers in 17 countries by 78 investigators. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary Objective: determination of the ability of reslizumab (110 mg) administered subcutaneously 
(sc) once every 4 weeks to produce a corticosteroid-sparing effect (as demonstrated by percent 
reduction in daily oral corticosteroid [OCS] use) in patients with OCS-dependent asthma and elevated 
blood eosinophils, without loss of asthma control. 
Secondary Objective: evaluation of the clinical benefits of reslizumab in the context of OCS reduction. 
Another efficacy objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of reslizumab on standard asthma 
control measures during tapering of OCS in patients with OCS-dependent asthma. 
Target Biomarker Objective: evaluation of the effect of sc dosing of reslizumab on blood eosinophil 
counts. 
Immunogenicity Objective: determination of the incidence of ADAs and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) 
after sc dosing of reslizumab.  
Pharmacokinetic Objective: characterisation of the PK of sc reslizumab in the study population. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The primary objective is a relevant objective for severe asthma patients.

Study design 
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in patients 12 years of 
age and older with OCS-dependent asthma and elevated blood eosinophils. 
The study consisted of a screening period of up to 2 weeks, followed by an optimization period of up to 
10 weeks, a run-in period of at least 2 weeks, a 24-week double-blind treatment period, an 8-week 
follow-up period, and a late 16-week follow-up period to collect drug wash-out samples for 
immunogenicity assessments. 
During the optimization period, the patient’s minimal effective OCS requirement was determined. The 
patient’s previous OCS was standardized to an equivalent dose and regimen of prednisone to the 
nearest 2.5 mg daily. 
For optimization, the OCS dose was reduced at 1-week intervals according to the algorithm of the 
protocol amendment 2, for up to 10 weeks or until there was a worsening of asthma signs and 
symptoms (minimum 1 day in optimization). When either a lung function or symptomatic deterioration 
occurred, the patient was to be returned to the previously effective OCS level, which would then 
constitute the minimally effective dose for the purpose of run-in. If this previously effective dose was 
no longer effective, the investigator could determine the clinically appropriate, minimally effective dose 
for the purpose of run-in. The optimization period was considered finished when patients experienced a 
worsening of asthma signs and symptoms, or if patients optimized to an OCS dose of <5 mg without a 
worsening of asthma signs and symptoms. 
Patients could enter run-in (visit 12) on the same day as optimization ended if the patients were on the 
minimally effective prednisone dose (did not require a prednisone burst at end optimization). Patients 
whose minimal effective OCS dose remained between ≥5 and ≤40 mg of prednisone daily at the end of 
optimization could advance to run-in.  
During run-in, patients continued maintained their minimally effective OCS dose and previous 
background asthma medications unchanged. The frequency of symptoms, use of inhaled reliever 
bronchodilator, night-time awakenings due to asthma requiring a rescue inhaler, and ambulatory lung 
function during the last 7 days of the run-in period constituted the baseline level of control for analysis 
and the basis for the OCS reduction algorithm used during the treatment period. 
The patient’s previous non-OCS background asthma controller medications were to be continued 
unchanged throughout the pre-randomization period and the entire study. At the beginning of the 
optimization period, asthma symptom diary and electronic peak flow meter were distributed, on which 
the patient recorded asthma symptoms, number of reliever bronchodilator inhalations, night-time 
awakenings due to asthma requiring rescue inhaler, and AM and PM PEF during optimisation period, 
run-in period and treatment period.

Study population /Sample size 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion (not all inclusive): 
• 
The patient was male or female, 12 years of age and older, with a previous diagnosis of 
asthma.  
Patients 12 to <18 years of age were excluded from participating in South Korea, the 
Netherlands, and Argentina, and patients 66 years of age and older were excluded from 
participating in South Korea. 
•  Written informed consent had to be obtained before a diagnosis of asthma was confirmed on 
the basis of patient history and by demonstration of airway reversibility.

The patient continued to require an average daily maintenance dose of OCS for asthma of 
between 5 and 40 mg of prednisone or equivalent during the 3 months before screening. 
Patients on an OCS dose of >40 mg at screening who the investigator believed may be able to 
decrease OCS dose to ≤40 mg during the optimization period could also be enrolled. 
Note: Every-other-day dosing that was within this daily average (i.e. 10 to 80 mg) was 
allowed. 
•

months while on at least medium total daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids based on the Global 
Initiative for Asthma 2016 clinical comparability table or ≥300/μL at screening while on chronic 
OCS or that became manifest during the OCS optimization period or at the week -2 visit (end 
of optimization period/beginning of run-in period).

maintenance OCS for the treatment of asthma. Previous use of such agents that occurred >5 
half-lives from the screening visit could be allowed if approved by the medical monitor. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The in- and exclusion criteria are acceptable.  
Treatments 
Investigational Product: Reslizumab 110 mg was administered sc once every 4 weeks through week 
20, for a total of 6 doses. 
Placebo: Matching placebo was administered sc once every 4 weeks through week 20, for a total of 6 
doses. 
Investigational product dosage regimen and duration of treatment sc dose and regimen were based on 
data from the iv program and sc data from Study C38072/1107. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Measure and Endpoint:  
The primary efficacy variable and endpoint for this study was the categorized percent reduction in the 
daily OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24, as compared with the dose at the end of the optimization 
phase. Percent reduction was categorized as follows: 90% to 100%; 75% to <90%; 50% to <75%; 
>0% to <50%; and no decrease in OCS, loss of baseline asthma control during weeks 20 through 24, 
or discontinuation of study drug.  
Loss of baseline asthma control was defined as FEV1 less than 80% of baseline at the week 24 visit, 
clinically significant worsening in ACQ-6 score (change in score of 0.5) at the week 24 visit compared 
with baseline, and/or CAE  during weeks 20 through 24. 
A CAE was defined as a clinically judged deterioration in asthma control, as determined by the 
investigator and as evidenced by new or worsening asthma signs or symptoms based on the patient 
history, asthma control diary, physical examination, and/or ambulatory or clinic visit assessment of 
lung function AND that resulted in a medical intervention, including at least 1 of the following: 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 8/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
• use of systemic corticosteroids (injection, or if oral, at least a doubling from the current OCS dose for 
at least 3 days)  
• asthma-specific hospital admission 
• asthma-specific emergency department visit 
Additional medication and/or medical intervention that would satisfy the CAE definition occurring within 
7 days of the last day of a prior CAE event was considered as part of the same event for analysis 
purposes. 
The CAE start and stop dates were collected to determine the exacerbation duration. The start date of 
a CAE was the start date of the initial medical intervention (eg, use of systemic corticosteroids 
[injection or, if oral, at least a doubling from the current OCS dose for at least 3 days], asthma-specific 
hospital admission, or asthma-specific emergency department visit, whichever came first). The stop 
date was the last day of systemic corticosteroids (injectable), or for those with a doubling of the OCS 
dose, the stop date was the date when the patient returned to their baseline dose, or the last day of an 
asthma-specific hospitalization or emergency department visit, whichever was later. For patients 
receiving at least a doubling from their current dose of OCS for at least 3 days that did not return to 
baseline (dose before exacerbation), an asthma exacerbation stop date was the day that they have 
been on a new stable dose for at least 10 days. 
Secondary Efficacy Measures and Endpoints:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of patients achieving ≥50% reduction in OCS dose at weeks 20 to 24 relative to the 
OCS dose at the date of randomization (DoR)/baseline, while maintaining asthma control  
Proportion of patients achieving dose reduction to ≤5-mg daily dose at weeks 20 to 24, while 
maintaining asthma control 
Percent change from DoR/baseline in OCS dose at weeks 20 to 24  
Proportion of patients achieving <5 mg decrement in OCS dose (ie, the minimal and non-
responders) at weeks 20 to 24, compared with the OCS dose at DoR/baseline, while 
maintaining asthma control  
Proportion of patients discontinuing OCS at weeks 20 to 24, while maintaining asthma control  
•  Annualized rate of clinical asthma exacerbations (CAEs) requiring a burst of systemic 
corticosteroid (injection or, if oral, at least a doubling from the current OCS dose for at least 3 
days), an asthma-specific hospital admission, or an asthma-specific emergency department 
visit during the treatment period (weeks 0 to 24) 
Other Pre-Specified Efficacy Measures and Endpoints: 
• 
Time to first CAE  
•  Other clinic lung functions, including the following: 
  Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1): change from DoR/baseline to 
weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 or early withdrawal  
  Post-bronchodilator FEV1: change from DoR/baseline to weeks 4, 12, 20, and 24 or early 
withdrawal  
  Ambulatory lung function: change in morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak expiratory flow from 
run-in baseline at each week through week 24 or early withdrawal  
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 9/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  Asthma Quality of Life +12 score: change from DoR/baseline to weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 
or early withdrawal  
  Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) score: change from DoR/baseline to weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 
20, and 24 or early withdrawal  
  Change in total inhalations of reliever bronchodilator medication (eg, short-acting beta-
agonist) (number of inhalations per 24 hours: day+night) from run-in baseline at each week 
through week 24 or early withdrawal  
  Number of night-time awakenings due to asthma over the 24-week treatment period 
  Change in total asthma symptom score from run-in baseline at each week through week 24 or 
early withdrawal 
  European Quality of Life 5-dimension health state utility index score: change from 
DoR/baseline to week 24 or early withdrawal 
  St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire score: change from DoR/baseline to weeks 12 and 24 or 
early withdrawal  
Clinical asthma exacerbation (CAE) is defined as requiring a burst of systemic corticosteroid (injection, 
or if oral, at least a doubling from the current OCS dose for at least 3 days); an asthma-specific 
hospital admission; or an asthma-specific  emergency department visit during the treatment period 
(weeks 0 to 24) 
Rapporteur’s comment 
Overall, the endpoints are generally accepted endpoints in asthma trials. The percentage reduction is 
calculated categorised. This is considered acceptable because this reflects the stepwise reduction 
(tapering) of OCS.  
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Excluding OCS, which was adjusted per protocol, the patient’s baseline asthma therapy regimen 
(including, but not limited to, ICS, leukotriene antagonists, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, and cromolyn) 
was to be stable for 30 days before screening and to be continued without dosage changes throughout 
the study. Changes in background maintenance therapy were to be discussed with the medical 
monitor. 
The following medications were allowed before and during this study: 
• 
• 
Inhaled fluticasone propionate at 880 μg or equivalent daily PLUS another controller(s) (eg, 
LABA, long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], leukotriene inhibitor, or theophylline) for at 
least 6 months before the screening visit. For a fixed-dose ICS/LABA preparation, the highest 
labelled dose in that region would satisfy this criterion. 
For patients 12 through <18 years of age, the ICS dose was to correspond to at least a 
medium total daily dose for the formulation. 
•  Allergen immunotherapy was allowed.  
• 
Inhaled reliever medications were allowed as needed for the relief of intermittent asthma 
symptoms. 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 10/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
• 
Prior asthma medications such as ICS, leukotriene pathway modifiers, long-acting 
bronchodilators, and mast cell stabilizers could be taken concomitantly and were not to be 
altered during this study, unless patient safety was at risk. 
The following medications were not allowed during this study: 
• 
• 
Patients were to refrain from using reliever inhalers for 6 hours before any study visit that 
included spirometry or airway reversibility testing, including the screening visit. 
If a patient was taking LABAs, these were to be withheld for 12 hours before any study visit 
that included spirometry or airway reversibility testing, including the screening visit. 
•  Any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents (biological and non-biological), 
including, but not limited to, methotrexate, cyclosporine, and interferon (excluding systemic 
corticosteroids prescribed for asthma and maintenance allergen immunotherapy). 
•  All biologic therapies, including, but not limited to, Xolair® (omalizumab), mepolizumab, 
benralizumab, lebrikizumab, and anti-tumor necrosis factor mAbs. 
•  All non-biologic investigational drugs. 
• 
Inhaled nicotine (including electronic cigarettes). 
At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator asked the patients whether they had taken 
any medications (other than study drug), including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal, 
or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit. Indication, dosage, and start and end dates were 
entered on the appropriate CRF. 
Statistical Methods 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized to reslizumab 110 mg sc or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. To achieve balance 
between treatment groups in the average daily OCS use/requirement and age, randomization was 
stratified by optimized, average daily OCS dose of >10 or ≤10 mg and age (12 to <18 years of age or 
≥18 years of age) at baseline. 
Sample size  
The primary efficacy variable and endpoint for this study is the percent reduction in the daily OCS dose 
during weeks 20 to 24 as compared with the dose at the end of the optimization phase.  
The study will be considered positive if the measure meets statistical significance at the respective 
predefined significance level. A statistically significant effect of reslizumab over placebo, as measured 
by the primary efficacy variable, is required to establish the efficacy of reslizumab treatment. 
The sample size was calculated based on the following assumptions: 
•  Categorical reduction in OCS dose after 24 weeks of treatment will have the following 
distribution for the placebo group (based on Bel et al 2014): 
− 10.9% percent of subjects will have 90% to 100% reduction 
− 7.9% percent of subjects will have 75% to <90% reduction 
− 14.8% percent of subjects will have 50% to <75% reduction 
− 10.8% percent of subjects will have 0% to <50% reduction 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 11/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
− 55.6% percent of subjects will have no reduction, loss of asthma control, or discontinuation 
from study drug 
• 
The overall odds ratio between reslizumab and placebo based on proportional odds model will 
be 2.63 
•  Alpha level of 0.05 
Based on the above assumptions, a sample size of 76 subjects per group will provide 90% power to 
detect a significant effect of reslizumab over placebo on the probability for a higher categorical 
reduction of OCS dose. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The sample size calculation is based on the results as observed for mepolizumab (Nucala) (Bel, 2014). 
Blinding  
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment through an IRT. Using this system ensured a balance 
across treatment groups; no effort was made to maintain a balance among treatment groups within a 
study centre. 
Patients and investigators remained blinded to treatment assignment during the study. The sponsor’s 
personnel involved in the study were also blinded to the study drug identity after the run-in period 
until the database was locked for analysis and the treatment assignment was revealed, with the 
exception of the bioanalytical group (Biologics Assays and Technology) who were not blinded to 
facilitate PK and ADA sample analyses. Eosinophils and monocytes were redacted from the post-
baseline differential cell count reports. 
Both reslizumab and placebo were provided as clear solutions. 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned patients and was used for all 
efficacy analyses, unless otherwise noted.  
The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and was used 
for all safety analyses, unless otherwise noted.  
The per-protocol analysis set was a subset of the ITT analysis set including only patients without major 
protocol violations and was used for sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint. 
An on-treatment approach was adopted as the primary analysis for the efficacy variables assessed by 
visit. In this analysis, the treatment period was defined from the first dose of study drug to the end of 
treatment (EOT) (week 24) visit for patients who completed treatment and from the first dose of study 
drug to the last dose of study drug (+4 weeks) for the patients who discontinued treatment early. 
The assessment of safety in this study was based on measurements and events recorded during the 
treatment period (on-treatment). On-treatment assessments were defined as events and 
measurements occurring between the first dose of study drug and the EOT (week 24) visit for patients 
who completed treatment and between the first dose of study drug and the last dose of study drug +4 
weeks for patients who discontinued treatment early. 
A fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure was implemented to test the primary and secondary 
variables while controlling the overall type I error rate at 0.05. If the resulting 2-sided p-value from 
the primary comparison was ≤0.05, then the next comparison of interest (first secondary variable) was 
interpreted inferentially at 0.05. This process continued through the secondary variables until either all 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 12/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
comparisons of interest were interpreted inferentially or until the point at which the resulting 2-sided 
p-value for a comparison of interest was >0.05. At the point where p>0.05, no further comparisons 
were interpreted inferentially. The hierarchy of secondary endpoints is presented in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. 
No multiplicity adjustments were made for other efficacy and exploratory analyses. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Baseline data 
A total of 273 patients with OCS-dependent severe eosinophilic asthma were screened; 180 patients 
were enrolled, and 177 patients were randomized in the study, all of whom received at least 1 dose of 
study drug.  
A total of 167 (94%) patients completed treatment (83 [93%] patients in the placebo group and 84 
[95%] patients in the reslizumab group), and 10 (6%) patients discontinued treatment (6 [7%] 
patients in the placebo group and 4 [5%] patients in the reslizumab group).  
A total of 167 (94%) patients completed the planned treatment phase (84 [94%] patients in the 
placebo group and 83 [94%] patients in the reslizumab group), and 10 (6%) patients discontinued the 
planned treatment phase (5 [6%] patients in both of the treatment groups).  
The most frequent reason for discontinuation from treatment was withdrawal by patient. A total of 165 
(93%) patients completed the study (84 [94%] patients in the placebo group and 81 [92%] patients in 
the reslizumab group), and 12 (7%) patients discontinued the study (5 [6%] patients in the placebo 
group and 7 [8%] patients in the reslizumab group). 
Only one adolescent was included and was randomised to placebo group.

Figure 2 Patient Disposition (All Patients) 
Rapporteur’s comment 
Overall, discontinuation was similar in both groups. The reason for discontinuation was slightly 
different, but this is considered irrelevant. 
Demographics 
Overall, the mean age of patients was 54.3 years (53.1 years in the placebo group and 55.5 years in 
the reslizumab group), and majority of patients were female (117 [66%] patients: 57 [64%] patients 
in the placebo group and 60 [68%] patients in the reslizumab group) and White (152 [86%] patients: 
80 [90%] patients in the placebo group and 72 [82%] patients in the reslizumab group). 
The mean airway reversibility at screening was 25.3% overall, and 27% of patients reported historical 
airway reversibility. Mean baseline pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 
1.655 L, and mean baseline post-bronchodilator FEV1 was 1.885 L. Mean FEV1 at baseline (percent 
predicted) was 57.0%. Forty-seven percent of subjects had an eosinophil count of ≥400/µL at 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 14/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
baseline, and the mean eosinophil count at baseline was 500/µL (521/µL in the placebo group and 
479/ µL in the reslizumab group). The mean OCS dose at baseline (optimized dose) was 10.37 mg in 
both treatment groups, and the mean duration of OCS use was 3.11 years.

Consistent with the target population of this study, all patients reported a history of asthma. The mean 
time since diagnosis was 20.1 years for the placebo group and 22.3 years for the reslizumab group. 
Twenty-nine percent of patients overall missed school or work due to asthma in the past 12 months 
(23 [26%] patients in the placebo group and 28 [32%] patients in the reslizumab group). Patients in 
the placebo and reslizumab groups missed an average of 22.13 and 31.04 days of school or work, 
respectively, due to asthma in the past 12 months.

Rapporteur’s comment 
The treatment groups were well balanced. A small difference is observed for baseline ppFEV1 in favour 
of the reslizumab group. The differences are not considered as clinically relevant. 
Efficacy results 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the 5-level categorized percent reduction in OCS dose during weeks 
20 to 24, as compared with the optimized dose at baseline. The primary efficacy endpoint was not met. 
There was no significant difference between placebo and reslizumab across the 5-level categorized 
percent reductions in the daily OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24 compared with the OCS dose at the 
end of the optimization phase (reslizumab versus placebo odds ratio for reduction of OCS use at weeks 
20 to 24 was 1.23 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.702, 2.157; p-value=0.468]). 
Approximately 20% of patients in both treatment groups reduced OCS use by 90% to 100% during 
weeks 20 to 24 (placebo 22% and reslizumab 20%). A larger percentage of patients in the reslizumab 
group reduced OCS use by 75% to <90% (placebo 4 [4%] patients and reslizumab 8 [9%] patients) 
and by 50% to <75% (placebo 8 [9%] patients and reslizumab 13 [15%] patients). Nine (10%) 
patients in the placebo group and 7 (8%) patients in the reslizumab group reduced OCS use by 0% to 
<50%. Approximately 50% (placebo 48 [54%] patients and reslizumab 42 [48%] patients) showed no 
decrease in OCS use (or loss of baseline asthma control) during weeks 20 to 24. 
Figure 3 Proportion of Patients in Each OCS Dose Reduction Category (Primary) at Weeks 20 
to 24 by Treatment Group (ITT Analysis Set) 
The results of the sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were similar to those for the primary 
efficacy endpoint. The Reslizumab versus placebo odds ratio (95% CI) with Multiple imputations 
including data retrieved post-dropout was 1.28 (0.728, 2.241) (p = 0.393) and for the PP analysis set 
1.07 (0.585, 1.975) (p= 0.816).  
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 18/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The primary efficacy endpoint was not met as there was no significant difference between placebo and 
reslizumab across the 5-level categorized percent reductions in the daily OCS dose; moreover, 
reslizumab versus placebo odds ratio for reduction of OCS (1.23 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.702, 
2.157; p-value=0.468]), was close to 1 while a odds ratio was expected of 2.63. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were not interpreted inferentially because the primary endpoint was not 
met.  
REDUCTION IN ORAL CORTICOSTEROID 
Results for secondary efficacy endpoints related to change in OCS use were similar to the primary 
efficacy analysis.  
Thirty-six percent of patients in the placebo group and 44% of patients in the reslizumab group 
reduced OCS dose by at least 50% at weeks 20 to 24. The reslizumab versus placebo odds ratio (95% 
CI) was 1.45 (0.786, 2.683; nominal p-value=0.234). 
Thirty-four (38%) patients in the placebo group and 37 (42%) patients in the reslizumab group 
reduced the OCS dose to ≤5 mg at weeks 20 to 24. The reslizumab versus placebo odds ratio (95% CI) 
was 1.45 (0.786, 2.683; nominal p-value=0.234) 
A decrease in OCS dose was observed in both treatment groups over the treatment period. The 
percent change (LS mean) from randomization/baseline in OCS dose at weeks 20 to 24 was -40.34 for 
the placebo group and -58.08 for the reslizumab group. The treatment difference (reslizumab minus 
placebo) (95% CI) at weeks 20 to 24 was -17.75% (-38.986, 3.494%) (nominal p-value=0.101).

Table 2 Secondary Analyses of Categorized OCS Dose Reduction at Weeks 20 to 24 (ITT 
Analysis Set) 
Rapporteur’s comment 
As for the primary endpoint, the results of the secondary endpoints addressing OCS reduction were 
only a slightly in favour of reslizumab, as observed for the responders. However, these similar results 
to the primary endpoints are not unexpected as they are strongly related to the primary endpoint.   
CLINICAL ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS 
Forty-three (48%) patients in the placebo group and 38 (43%) patients in the reslizumab group had at 
least 1 CAE reported while on study treatment. The mean (SD) frequency of CAEs observed during the 
treatment period was 0.8 (0.98) in the placebo group and 0.6 (0.77) in the reslizumab group.  
When exacerbation duration was excluded from the offset variable, the adjusted CAE rate (95% CI) 
was 1.86 (1.283, 2.682) in the placebo group and 1.51 (1.052, 2.177) in the reslizumab group. The 
reslizumab versus placebo CAE rate ratio (95% CI) was 0.82 (0.504, 1.321) (nominal p-value=0.407). 
When exacerbation duration was not excluded from the offset variable, the adjusted CAE rate (95% 
CI) was 1.64 (1.183, 2.283) in the placebo group and 1.41 (1.010, 1.981) in the reslizumab group. 
The reslizumab versus placebo CAE rate ratio (95% CI) was 0.86 (0.553, 1.340) (nominal p-
value=0.506).  
The time to first CAE was similar for both treatment groups. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 
probability of not experiencing a CAE by week 24 (95% CI) was 0.52 (0.41, 0.62) for the placebo 
group and 0.57 (0.46, 0.67) for the reslizumab group. The reslizumab versus placebo hazard rate ratio 
(95% CI) was 0.80 (0.519, 1.247) (nominal p-value=0.330).

Table 3 Frequency of Clinical Asthma Exacerbations (ITT Analysis Set) 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The results of the secondary endpoints addressing clinical asthma exacerbation were numerically in 
favour of reslizumab. However the duration of the study would not been long enough for measuring 
pulmonary exacerbations accurately. 
PULMONARY FUNCTIONS TESTS 
The exploratory and other clinical efficacy endpoints, including change in FEV1, did not show a 
statistically significant difference between the placebo and reslizumab groups.

FEV1 
The increases from baseline observed in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1 from DoR/baseline to week 
24 or early withdrawal were similar for the placebo and reslizumab treatment groups. 
The LS mean (±SE) change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to the Week 24 was 0.241 
(0.142) L for the placebo group and 0.222 (0.145) L for the reslizumab group. The reslizumab-placebo 
treatment difference (95% CI) was -0.019 (-0.122, 0.085) L (nominal p-value=0.724). The LS mean 
(±SE) change from DoR/baseline to week 24 or early withdrawal in post-bronchodilator FEV1 was 
0.113 (0.135) L for the placebo group and 0.131 (0.139) L for the reslizumab group. The reslizumab-
placebo treatment difference (95% CI) was 0.018 (-0.082, 0.117) L (nominal p-value=0.729).  
The LS mean (±SE) change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to the Week 32 was 0.391 
(0.194) L in the placebo group and 0.277 (0.201) L in the reslizumab group. The reslizumab-placebo 
treatment difference (95% CI) was -0.114 (-0.237, 0.008) (nominal p-value=0.067). The LS mean 
(±SE) change in post-bronchodilator FEV1 was 0.280 (0.179) L in the placebo group and 0.211 (0.185) 
L in the reslizumab group. The reslizumab-placebo treatment difference (95% CI) was -0.069 (-0.183, 
0.045) (nominal p-value=0.233).

Rapporteur’s comment 
The results of the secondary endpoints addressing pulmonary function did not show a difference 
between reslizumab and placebo, although the study duration was long enough for measuring 
pulmonary function.

QUALITY OF LIFE AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES 
Rapporteur’s comment 
For PRO the responder analyses are considered very important because these questionnaires are 
validated for individual scores and not for comparisons on groups level.  
The Applicant refers for responder analyses for the PRO to Summary 15. This is not found in the 
documentation. The Applicant is requested to submit the module summary 15 with all the referred 
results.  
The quality-of-life endpoints did not show differences between the treatment groups. 
ACQ-6:  
Higher ACQ-6 scores are an indication of poorer asthma control. Overall ACQ-6 scores decreased in 
both treatment groups from DoR/baseline to week 24 or early withdrawal. The LS mean (±SE) change 
in ACQ-6 score was -0.45 (0.389) in the placebo group and -0.62 (0.397) in the reslizumab group. At 
week 24, the reslizumab-placebo treatment difference (95% CI) was -0.17 (-0.458, 0.114) (nominal p-
value=0.238).

Group (ITT Analysis Set) 
Source: Graph 17.4.1 and Summary 15.2.4.1. 
ACQ-6=6-item Asthma Control Questionnaire; B=baseline; ITT=intent- to- treat; LS=least squares; SE=standard 
error. 
Notes: The ACQ-6 is a 6-item instrument; each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 6 (higher scores are an indication 
of poorer asthma control). The ACQ-6 score is the mean of the 6 questions. 
The proportion of patients who achieved a ≥0.5-unit decrease in ACQ-6 score from baseline was similar 
in both treatment groups. At week 24, 38 (46%) patients in the placebo group and 39 (47%) patients 
in the reslizumab group had achieved a decrease in ACQ-6 score ≥0.5 units (nominal p-value=0.831).  
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 23/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AQLQ 
Higher AQLQ +12 scores indicate improved quality of life. An increase in overall AQLQ +12 score was 
observed in both treatment groups during the study.  
The LS mean (±SE) change in AQLQ +12 score from DoR/baseline to week 24 was 0.67 (0.396) in the 
placebo group and 0.92 (0.407) in the reslizumab group. The reslizumab-placebo treatment difference 
(95% CI) was 0.25 (-0.056, 0.551) (nominal p-value=0.110).  
The proportion of patients who achieved a ≥0.5-unit increase in AQLQ +12 score from baseline was 
similar in both treatment groups during the study (Summary 15.2.3.2). When assessed from 
DoR/baseline to week 24, an increase of ≥0.5 units was observed in 34 (42%) patients in the placebo 
group and 36 (47%) patients in the reslizumab group (nominal p-value=0.459). 
SGRQ 
The SGRQ scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, where 100 represents the 
worst possible health status, and 0 represents the best possible health status. Overall SGRQ scores 
decreased from DoR/baseline in both treatment groups on study, with a slightly larger decrease 
observed over time in the reslizumab group. 
At week 24, the LS mean (±SE) change was -7.6 (6.59) in the placebo group and -10.1 (6.73) in the 
reslizumab group at week 24. The reslizumab-placebo treatment difference (95% CI) at week 24 was -
2.5 (-7.00, 2.01) (nominal p-value=0.276). 
The SGRQ domain scores, including domains of Symptoms, Activity, and Impact, were similar to the 
overall SGRQ scores and are summarized in Summary 15.2.5.1. The proportion of patients who 
achieved a ≥4.0-unit decrease from baseline to each visit in SGRQ score is summarized in Summary 
15.2.5.2.  
SNOT-22 
Higher SNOT-22 scores represent worse quality of life and lower SNOT-22 scores represent 
improvement in quality of life. Changes in SNOT-22 score from DoR/baseline to week 24 were similar 
between treatment groups over time. 
At week 24, the LS mean (±SE) change was -0.11 (0.163) in the placebo group (n=19) and -0.10 
(0.157) in the reslizumab group (n=21). The reslizumab-placebo treatment difference (95% CI) in 
SNOT-22 score at week 24 was 0.00 (-0.447, 0.451) (nominal p-value=0.993). 
Rapporteur’s comment 
For PRO the responder analyses are considered very important because these questionnaires are 
validated for individual scores and not for comparisons on groups level.  
These responder analyses of the quality-of-life endpoints, as far as available,  did not show relevant 
differences between the treatment groups. 
The Applicant is requested to submit the module summary 15 with all the referred results.  
BIOMARKER VARIABLES 
Blood eosinophil counts 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 24/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Blood eosinophil counts decreased in both treatment groups between baseline and week 4 and 
remained below baseline until the follow-up visit.  
The mean (SD) change in blood eosinophil counts from DoR/baseline to week 24 was -0.144 109/L 
(0.5040) in the placebo group and -0.385 109/L (0.3570) in the reslizumab group.  
Figure 6 Blood Eosinophil Counts (109/L): Mean (±SE) Change from Baseline to Each Visit 
by Treatment Group (ITT Analysis Set) 
Rapporteur’s comment 
The difference in mean (SD) change in blood eosinophil counts from DoR/baseline to week 24 was 
between reslizumab and placebo was -0.241 109/L, indicating that sc reslizumab 110 mg q4w 
effectively reduced peripheral eosinophils as expected, based on the mechanism of action of an anti-IL-
5 mAb. 
However, this difference is smaller than observed in the two pivotal registration trials, in which the 
differences were - 0.475 and - 0.476 109/L. In these trials reslizumab was administered intravenously.  
Immunogenicity 
A summary of the ADA assay data collected under this protocol is presented in Table 4.  
Table 4 Serum Samples Collected for Anti-Drug Antibody Analysis (ITT Analysis Set) 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 25/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Eleven of the 88 (13%) reslizumab-treated patients had treatment-emergent ADA responses (Table 5); 
a patient was classified as having a treatment-emergent ADA response if a sample tested positive at a 
post-baseline visit, which was not positive at the baseline visit, or if the titre increased at least 4-fold 
at a post-baseline visit relative to the positive baseline sample. Eight of the 11 patients had an ADA-
positive sample at a single post-dose sampling time. Three patients had ADA-positive samples at 2 
sampling times, which were at most 8 weeks apart, followed by ADA-negative samples at subsequent 
time points. 
In 4 patients, the ADA sample collected prior to drug administration tested positive. Two of these 
patients did not have a post-dose ADA-positive result at any time point available and were therefore 
considered to be negative for treatment-emergent ADA. The other 2 patients had post-dose ADA-
positive samples; however, the titre of the response did not increase at least 4-fold over the pre-dose 
ADA titre and was also determined to be negative for treatment-emergent ADA. 
The anti-reslizumab antibody titers were generally low and ranged from 1.94 to 27.0 in linear scale.

Table 5 Subjects With Treatment-Emergent Positive ADA Results Including Titres (ITT 
Population) 
Impact of Anti-Drug Antibody on Clinical Outcomes 
The clinical outcome results for patients with post-baseline positive ADA results (Table 6) were 
comparable to those for the overall reslizumab group.  
None of the ADA-positive samples were identified as having neutralizing activity; therefore, no patients 
had developed a NAb response.

Table 6 Clinical Outcomes for Patients with Post-Baseline Treatment-Emergent Positive ADA 
Status (ITT Analysis Set) 
Rapporteur’s comment 
There was no difference with the overall population and ADA positive patients for CAE and categorized 
percentage OCS reduction. However, there was a difference for FEV1 and blood eosinophil counts:  
−  The LS mean (±SE) change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to the Week 24 was 
0.222 (0.145) L for the reslizumab group and -0.015 for the ADA + reslizumab treated 
patients.   
−  The mean (SD) change in blood eosinophil counts from DoR/baseline to week 24 was -0.385 
109/L (0.3570) in the reslizumab group and -0.202 (0.1173) for the ADA + reslizumab treated 
patients.   
There were too few ADA positive patients to unequivocally interpret the effect of the development of 
ADAs on efficacy.  
Safety results 
Exposure 
Exposure to study drug was similar for the placebo and reslizumab treatment groups. The mean 
duration of exposure was 166.2 days, and 92% of patients received all 6 planned injections. 
Adverse Events 
Forty-seven (53%) patients in the placebo group and 57 (65%) patients in the reslizumab group 
reported at least 1 adverse event.  
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 28/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events considered to be treatment related by the investigator were reported in 3 (3%) 
patients in the placebo group and 7 (8%) patients in the reslizumab group. Four (4%) patients in the 
placebo group and 10 (11%) patients in the reslizumab group had serious adverse events during the 
treatment period; none were considered treatment related. There was 1 death reported in the study (a 
61-year-old male in the reslizumab group who had sudden death suspected to be due to pulmonary 
embolism based on the assessment of the physician who registered the death, which occurred 7 days 
after the first reslizumab dose); it was not considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
During the study, 1 patient (placebo group) was discontinued from treatment due to a non-serious 
adverse event (Table 7).  
No specific patterns were identified in the subgroups. 
Table 7 Overview of Adverse Events (Safety Analysis Set) 
Overall, in the Safety Analysis Set, the SOCs with adverse events reported most frequently (≥8% 
overall) were Infections and Infestations (39% overall); Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal 
Disorders (14% overall); General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (9% overall); 
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (8% overall); and Nervous System Disorders (8% 
overall).  
SOCs in which more adverse events were reported in the reslizumab group compared with the placebo 
group (at least 5% higher) were Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal (placebo 11% and reslizumab 
17%); General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (placebo 6% and reslizumab 13%); and 
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (placebo 4% and reslizumab 11%). 
The most commonly reported adverse events (≥5% in either treatment group) were viral upper 
respiratory tract infection, asthma, bronchitis, headache, influenza, injection site pain, and rhinitis 
allergic. A summary of commonly reported adverse events (≥2% in either treatment group) is 
presented in  
Table 8. 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 29/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Events that occurred more frequently in the reslizumab group compared with the placebo group (at 
least 5% higher) were viral upper respiratory tract infection (13% and 6%, respectively) and rhinitis 
allergic (5% and 0%, respectively). 
Events that occurred more frequently in the placebo group compared with the reslizumab group 
included respiratory tract infection viral (4% and 2%, respectively).

Severity of Adverse Events 
Most adverse events for patients in both treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity. 
Severe adverse events occurred more frequently in the reslizumab group than in the placebo group; 4 
(4%) patients in the placebo group and 11 (13%) patients in the reslizumab group had severe adverse 
events (Table 9). Severe adverse events occurring in at least 2 patients were asthma (2% of patients 
each in both treatment groups) and injection site pain (2% of patients in the reslizumab group). All 
other occurrences of severe adverse events occurred in 1 (1%) patient.  
Table 9: Summary of Severe Adverse Events by Preferred Term (Safety Analysis Set) 
Attribution of Adverse Events 
Adverse events considered to be treatment related by the investigator were reported more frequently 
in the reslizumab group (7 [8%] patients) than in the placebo group (3 [3%] patients), and most of 
treatment-related adverse events in the reslizumab group were injection site reactions (Table 10). 
Treatment-related injection site pain was reported by 1 (1%) patient in the placebo group and 4 (5%) 
patients in the reslizumab group. Treatment-related myalgia was reported by 1 (1%) patient in both 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 31/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
the placebo and reslizumab groups. All other treatment-related adverse events were reported by 1 
(1%) patient.  
Table 10: Treatment-Related Adverse Events by Preferred Term (Safety Analysis 
Set) 
Rapporteur’s comment 
There was only a relevant difference between reslizumab ad placebo for  Injection site pain.  
This difference may be due to the administration method as such difference was not observe with I.V. 
administration. 
Adverse Events Occurring Within 24 Hours of Study Drug Administration 
The overall proportion of adverse events occurring within 24 hours after study injection was the same 
for both treatment groups (8 [9%] patients in each group). Injection site pain was the most common 
adverse event reported within 24 hours after study drug injection (1 [1%] patient in the placebo group 
and 4 [5%] patients in the reslizumab group). Most adverse events that occurred within 24 hours after 
study drug injections were mild or moderate in severity. Two (2%) patients in the reslizumab group 
had severe adverse events that occurred with 24 hours after study drug injections, including injection 
site pain (2 [2%] patients) and pain in extremity (1 [1%] patient).  
Adverse Events by ADA Status 
All eleven reslizumab-treated patients with treatment-emergent ADA responses reported at least 1 
adverse event similar to the adverse events reported by patients with ADA-negative responses, the 
most frequently reported SOC for patients with ADA-positive responses was Infections and 
Infestations.  
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 32/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In general, the percentages of patients with positive or negative ADA treatment-emergent responses 
who experienced an adverse event were similar for most SOCs and PTs. Except for Headache and 
Allergic rhinitis, which were reported by 2 patients each, all adverse events were reported by single 
positive ADA patients.  
Under the Immune System Disorders SOC, 1 event of drug hypersensitivity and 1 event of food allergy 
were reported, neither of which were considered related to study drug or led to discontinuation of 
treatment.  
Rapporteur’s comment 
Overall, the pattern was similar between patients with ADA and patients without ADA. However, the 
number of patients was limited in this trial. 
Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events 
There was 1 death during the study in the reslizumab group. 
A total of 14 (8%) patients experienced serious adverse events during the treatment period of the 
study (4 [4%] patients in the placebo group and 10 [11%] patients in the reslizumab group). 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation from treatment were reported by 1 patient in the placebo 
group. 
Adverse events of special interest, administration site reactions, anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity, 
malignancies, opportunistic infections and helminth infections, muscle disorders, and increased CPK 
levels are discussed below. 
Deaths 
There was 1 death during the study in the reslizumab group. This event was not considered related to 
the study drug.  
A 61-year-old white male in the reslizumab group died 7 days after the first reslizumab sc injection. 
The patient was in his usual health until approximately 5 minutes before his death. The death was 
reported as sudden death not otherwise specified, possibly due to pulmonary embolism based on the 
diagnosis of the physician who registered the death, and was considered by the investigator as 
unrelated to study drug. An autopsy was not performed. 
No other adverse events were reported for this patient during the study. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Fourteen (8%) patients had 1 or more treatment-emergent serious adverse events during the 
treatment period in this study (4 [4%] patients in the placebo group and 10 [11%] patients in the 
reslizumab group [Table 11]). Serious adverse events were most frequently reported in the SOCs of 
Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders (2 [2%] patients in the placebo group and 3 [3%] 
patients in the reslizumab group) and Infections and Infestations (1 [1%] patient in the placebo group 
and 3 [3%] patients in the reslizumab group). Serious adverse events reported in other SOCs occurred 
in 1 (1%) patient each. None of the serious adverse events reported during the study were assessed 
as related to the study drug by the investigator, including the SAE of drug hypersensitivity, which was 
secondary to an allergic reaction to co-trimoxazole.

Table 11: Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term (Safety 
Analysis Set) 
Rapporteur’s comment 
Overall, the pattern was similar between patients treated with reslizumab and patients treated with 
placebo, although in total more SAEs occurred in patients treated with reslizumab.  
Overall, this difference has no consequence.

Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events 
One patient in the placebo group discontinued from treatment due to an adverse event of generalized 
pruritus. 
Protocol- and SAP-Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Six cases of hypersensitivity were reported during the study: 2 events of drug hypersensitivity (to 
concomitant medications), both in the reslizumab group; 2 events of food/supplement allergy, 1 event 
in each treatment group; and 1 event each of allergy to arthropod bite (reslizumab group) and pruritus 
generalized (placebo group). No events of hypersensitivity were considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug.  
A patient in the reslizumab group had a serious event of drug hypersensitivity 22 days after 
the third sc injection and on the day of starting co-trimoxazole for a respiratory infection. The 
investigator considered the event of drug hypersensitivity to be a serious allergic reaction to 
concomitant use of co-trimoxazole and not related to study drug. The event was considered 
severe and resolved 1 day after onset. 
A patient in the reslizumab group had a non-serious event of drug hypersensitivity 8 days after 
the sixth sc injection and on the same day as the first dose of penicillin. The investigator 
considered the event of drug hypersensitivity to be an allergic reaction to concomitant use of 
penicillin and not related to study drug. The event was considered moderate in severity and 
resolved the same day as onset. 
A patient in the reslizumab group had a non-serious adverse event of food allergy (allergic 
reaction due to wheat beer consumption) 3 days after the second sc injection and the same 
day that the patient consumed the wheat beer. The investigator considered the event of 
allergic reaction to be due to a pre-existing known food allergy and not related to study drug. 
The event was considered mild in severity and resolved the same day as onset. 
A patient in the reslizumab group had a non-serious adverse event of allergy to arthropod bite 
32 days after the fourth sc injection. The investigator considered the event of allergy to 
arthropod bite to be not related to study drug. The event was considered mild in severity and 
resolved 14 days after onset. 
A patient in the placebo group had a non-serious adverse event of systemic urticaria (possible 
allergic reaction to concomitant use of an effervescent tablet with vitamin C plus zinc) 23 days 
after the fifth sc injection and on the same day that the effervescent tablet was consumed). 
The investigator considered the event of systemic urticaria as not related to study drug. The 
event was considered moderate in severity and resolved the next day. 
A patient in the placebo group had a non-serious adverse event of pruritus generalized on the 
same day as the fourth sc injection. The investigator considered the event of pruritus 
generalized to be related to study drug. The event was considered moderate in severity, and 
administration of study drug was permanently discontinued due to the event. The event 
resolved 2 days after onset. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
It is stated that no events of hypersensitivity were considered by the investigator to be related to 
study drug. However, it seems that the case of the last patient above described was considered the 
event being related to study drug, because the study drug as permanently discontinued.  
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 35/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Therefore, it is considered that the event was drug related. After deblinding it turned out The study 
drug was placebo. 
Adverse events with terms falling under the anaphylactic reaction SMQ (broad criteria) occurred in 12 
(13%) patients in the placebo group and 12 (14%) patients in the reslizumab group (Summary 
15.3.2.14.1). The most common reported terms were asthma (6 [7%] patients in the placebo group 
and 8 [9%] patients in the reslizumab group), cough (1 [1%] patient in the placebo group and 2 [2%] 
patients in the reslizumab group) and dyspnoea (no patients in the placebo group and 2 [2%] patients 
in the reslizumab group). No events fell under the PTs under anaphylactic reaction SMQ-narrow 
(Summary 15.3.2.14.2). All adverse event terms in the anaphylactic SMQ were considered by the 
investigator as unrelated to study drug. 
Rapporteur’s comment 
Hypersensitivity ad anaphylactic reaction are known adverse events of reslizumab.  
Adverse events with terms falling under the anaphylactic reaction SMQ (broad criteria) overlap with 
symptoms of asthma exacerbation. Therefore, the interpretation of  anaphylactic reaction is hampered. 
However, anaphylactic reaction SMQ-narrow is considered more informative. According to the Applicant 
no events felt under anaphylactic reaction SMQ-narrow. However, the source is lacking in the dossier. 
The Applicant is request to provide module summary 15.  
Malignancies 
No malignancies or events of opportunistic infections or helminth infections were reported during this 
study. 
Muscle Disorders 
Muscle disorders included muscle disorder HLGT and blood creatine phosphokinase increased PTs and 
occurred in 5 (6%) patients in the placebo group and 6 (7%) patients in the reslizumab group (Table 
12).  
There were 3 cases of myalgia in the study (1 subject in the placebo group and 2 subjects in the 
reslizumab group), 2 of which was considered to be related to study drug (1 [1%] patient in each 
treatment group). All other muscle disorder events were considered by the investigator as unrelated to 
study drug.  
A patient in the reslizumab group had a non-serious adverse event of myalgia 11 days after 
the first sc injection. The investigator considered the event of myalgia as related to OCS 
withdrawal and use, and not related to study drug. The event was considered moderate in 
severity and resolved 3 days after onset. 
Another patient in the reslizumab group had a non-serious adverse event of myalgia 47 days 
after the sixth sc injection. The investigator considered the event of myalgia as not related to 
study drug and not related to OCS use or withdrawal. The event was considered moderate in 
severity and resolved 22 days after onset. 
Another patient in the placebo group had a non-serious adverse event of myalgia after an sc 
injection (date of the event onset not specified). The investigator considered the event of 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 36/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
myalgia as possibly related to study drug and not related to OCS use or withdrawal. The event 
was considered moderate in severity and ongoing when the patient completed the study. 
Table 12 Muscle Disorders (Safety Analysis Set) 
Rapporteur’s comment 
Muscle disorders, blood creatine phosphokinase increased and myalgia are known adverse events of 
reslizumab.  
Muscle disorders and myalgia are also symptoms caused by OCS withdrawal. Therefore, the 
interpretation of these symptoms are hampered by this overlap.  
Given the low number of events and the quite similar frequency, changes in the existing SmPC are not 
considered necessary.  
Administration Site Reactions 
Administration site reactions were reported in 4% of the safety analysis set (2 [2%] patients in the 
placebo group and 5 [6%] patients in the reslizumab group) and included events of injection site pain, 
bruising, and swelling. A greater percentage of patients in the reslizumab group (5%) reported events 
of injection site pain (compared with 1% in the placebo group). The majority of administration site 
reactions were mild or moderate in severity. All events of injection site pain and swelling were 
considered by the investigator as related to the study drug. Injection site bruising was considered by 
the investigator as unrelated to the study drug. 
The adverse event profile of patients with positive or negative ADA treatment-emergent responses was 
similar. Two patients with positive post-baseline ADA values reported adverse events under the 
Immune System Disorders SOC. One event of drug hypersensitivity and 1 event of food allergy were 
reported, neither of which was considered related to study drug or led to discontinuation of treatment. 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 37/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Three patients in the placebo group and 1 patient in the reslizumab group had post-baseline PCS CPK 
values that were reported as adverse events. All CPK elevations were transient and normalized by the 
end of the study, except for 1 case for 1 patient in the placebo group on day 171 (CPK value of 801 
U/L, which was ≥3.1 but <10× ULN and an increase of >0 from baseline) (Listing 16.2.8.2 and Listing 
16.2.8.6). None of the PCS CPK values were assessed as related to study drug or lead to 
discontinuation. 
CPK values ≥3.1×ULN were considered adverse events. Four patients in the placebo group (5 events) 
and 1 patient in the reslizumab group had adverse events of blood CPK increased, including the PCS 
CPK values described above, all of which were assessed as not related to study drug and considered 
resolved.  
Rapporteur’s comment 
Creatine phosphokinase increased is a known adverse event of reslizumab. Given the low number of 
events and the fact that are more events were observed in the placebo group, changes in the existing 
SmPC are not considered necessary.  
Vital Signs, Electrocardiogram, and Physical Examination Findings 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in vital signs measurements, electrocardiogram results, or 
physical examination findings. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data of reslizumab was generated and  is included in the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis that will be reported separately (Report CP-17-15).  
Rapporteur’s comment 
Report CP-17-15 was not submitted yet, so conclusions can be made. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Therapeutic Context 
Reslizumab is a humanized anti-human interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody (anti-IL-5 mAb). Reslizumab 
works by binding to IL-5 and preventing its binding to the IL-5 receptor, thereby reducing circulating 
and tissue eosinophils. 
The iv reslizumab 3-mg/kg dose was shown to be effective at reducing CAE rate and improving lung 
function and asthma control in 4 placebo-controlled trials of the Phase 3 BREATH program. The 110-
mg sc dose proposed for the reslizumab sc program was selected based on exposure projected to be 
equivalent to approximately 1 mg/kg iv in an average-sized person and assuming the bioavailability 
observed in Study C38072/1107 (67%). 
Modelling and simulation prior to the start of the Phase 3 sc program showed that predicted steady-
state trough serum concentrations of reslizumab following administration of the to-be-studied 110 mg 
sc dosing regimen, based on the assumed bioavailability of 67%, were expected to fall within the range 
of exposures that produced meaningful effects on both blood eosinophils and FEV1 in patients with 
eosinophilic asthma.  
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 38/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Design and conduct of the study 
The current study C38072-AS-30027 was a Phase 3, 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group efficacy and safety study in patients with OCS-dependent asthma and elevated blood 
eosinophils. This study sought to determinate the ability to produce a corticosteroid-sparing of sc 
reslizumab 110 mg administered every 4 weeks  
The study consisted of a screening period of up to 2 weeks, followed by an optimization period of up to 
10 weeks, a run-in period of at least 2 weeks, a 24-week double-blind treatment period, an 8-week 
follow-up period, and a late 16-week follow-up period to collect drug wash-out samples for 
immunogenicity assessments. During the optimization period, the patient’s minimal effective OCS 
requirement was determined. The During the optimization period, the patient’s minimal effective OCS 
requirement was determined.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the 5-level categorized percent reduction in OCS dose during weeks 
20 to 24, as compared with the optimized dose at baseline. Percent reduction was categorized as 
follows: 90% to 100%; 75% to <90%; 50% to <75%; >0% to <50%; and no decrease in OCS, loss 
of baseline asthma control during weeks 20 through 24, or discontinuation of study drug.  
The current study was designed to evaluate the OCS-sparing effect of sc reslizumab in a population 
with more severe asthma at baseline compared to the patients included in the registration trials in 
which low dose OCS (≤ 10 mg) was allowed, but not required.   
A sample size of 76 subjects per group was calculated to provide 90% power to detect a significant 
effect (overall odds ratio 0f 2.63) of reslizumab over placebo on the probability for a higher categorical 
reduction of OCS dose, based on the publication for mepolizumab (Bel et al 2014).  
Efficacy data 
The results of the primary efficacy analysis were not statistically significant, and therefore the primary 
endpoint of this study was not met. The reslizumab versus placebo odds ratio (95% CI) for reduction 
of OCS use at weeks 20 to 24 was 1.23 (0.702, 2.157; p-value=0.468).  
The results of the sensitivity analyses were similar to those for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Results of subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint were similar to the results of the primary 
efficacy analysis.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints were not interpreted inferentially because the primary endpoint was not 
met. The percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 CAE (48% and 43% in the placebo and 
reslizumab groups, respectively) was similar between treatment groups. The mean (SD) frequency of 
CAEs during the treatment period was lower for the reslizumab group (0.8 [0.98] for the placebo group 
and 0.6 [0.77] for the reslizumab group) but was not statistically significant.  
Results for secondary efficacy endpoints related to change in OCS use were similar to the primary 
efficacy analysis. 
The exploratory and other clinical and quality-of-life endpoints including change in FEV1 did not show 
neither a clinically relevant nor a statistically significant difference between the placebo and reslizumab 
groups. 
Decreases from baseline in blood eosinophil counts were larger in the reslizumab group than in the 
placebo group, but were lower compared to the results of the pivotal registration trials with I.V. 
administration.  
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 39/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
None of the ADA-positive samples were identified as having neutralizing activity; therefore, no patients 
had developed a Nab response. 
No data for adolescents became available as the only one adolescents included was randomised to 
placebo group.  
Safety data 
The majority of patients in both treatment groups received study treatment for ≥ 5 months and 
received ≥ 6 sc injections. 
Overall, 59% of patients in the safety analysis set had at least 1 adverse event during the study; 
adverse events with a frequency ≥5% in either treatment group included viral upper respiratory tract 
infection, asthma, bronchitis, headache, influenza, injection site pain, and rhinitis allergic. The 
frequency of these events was higher in the reslizumab group. 
Treatment-related adverse events occurred more frequently in the reslizumab group (8%) compared 
with the placebo group (3%). The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event was 
injection site pain.  
Serious adverse events were reported in 11% in the reslizumab group compared to 4% in the placebo 
group, with the majority in single patients and with events that are expected for adult patients with 
eosinophilic asthma.  
Treatment-emergent ADA responses were observed in 11 of the 88 (13%) reslizumab-treated patients, 
all transient. The anti-reslizumab antibody titres were generally low. Two patients with positive post-
baseline ADA values reported adverse events under the Immune System Disorders SOC. One event of 
drug hypersensitivity and 1 event of food allergy were reported, neither of which was considered 
related to study drug or led to discontinuation of treatment. 
Six cases of hypersensitivity were reported during the study: 2 in the placebo group and 4 in the 
reslizumab group. No hypersensitivity events were considered related to reslizumab. One patient in the 
placebo group with an event of generalized pruritus discontinued treatment permanently. Events under 
the anaphylactic reaction and hypersensitivity SMQs (narrow and broad) were reported in a similar 
incidence in both treatment groups, with the most common events related to underlying asthma 
disease (eg, asthma, cough) and pre-existing allergic conditions (eg, allergic rhinitis). 
No malignancies or events of opportunistic infections or helminth infections were reported.  
Muscle disorders, including blood CPK increased, were reported at a similar frequency in both 
treatment groups (6% overall).  
Administration site reactions were reported in both treatment groups with a greater percentage of 
patients in the reslizumab group, mainly due to more reports of injection site pain.  
One death occurred during the study (event of sudden death, possibly pulmonary embolism), which 
was considered by the investigator and sponsor as unrelated to reslizumab.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The primary efficacy endpoint of reduction in OCS dose was not met: there was no statistically 
significant improvement in efficacy measures. However, a modest reduction in blood eosinophil levels 
was observed in the reslizumab group.   
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 40/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The reasons for not achieving the objective of this study may be the lower exposure compare to the 
I.V. administration. The model-predicted effects of body weight and age of population pharmacokinetic 
analysis are suggestive for a considerably higher absolute bioavailability for lighter and younger 
patients, which may be relevant for the adolescents and children. However, the expected response 
may have also been too high (overall odds ration 2.63), but in the pulmonary function test endpoints 
and quality of life endpoint did not show a relevant difference, suggesting that the exposure may have 
been too low.  
Subcutaneous reslizumab 110 mg every 4 weeks s.c. was well tolerated in patients with OCS-
dependent asthma and elevated blood eosinophils. The adverse events reported during the study are 
consistent with the expected profile for a population of adult patients with OCS-dependent asthma and 
elevated blood eosinophils. 
The submitted clinical study data with reslizumab sc did not influence the benefit risk evaluation of the 
registered reslizumab 10 mg/ml IV formulation in adults. Since the sc formulation is not being 
developed anymore and sc administration is not included in the current registration dossier for 
Cinqaero, no update of the SmPC is considered necessary for Study C38072-AS-30027 submitted 
under Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. No data for adolescents became 
available as the only one adolescent included was randomised to placebo group.  
To be noted: in paediatric investigation plan EMEA-0012-02-PIP02-13, the development of a 
subcutaneous formulation in paediatric patients aged 6-<12 was specifically requested, since the 
reslizumab mechanism of action was expected to be relevant in children with EA ages 6 through 11 
years, and these patients would be better served by a sc formulation administered via a thin needle, 
rather than by an iv infusion, due to the inconvenience and pain associated with iv infusions. Stopping 
development of the sc formulation in children aged 6-11 has, therefore, consequences for the existing 
agreed paediatric investigation plan, and should be discussed within the PDCO.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
QUESTION 1: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide module Summary 15 with all the 
referred results and Report CP-17-15 as part of this procedure. (See section “Additional 
clarification requested.”) 
Teva’s Response: 
The Clinical Study Report (CSR) submitted was incomplete, omitting Summary 15. A complete 
C38072-AS-30027 CSR, which includes all the Section 15 summaries and graphs referred to in the CSR 
body, is now submitted with this response. 
In addition, it was noted that Table 26 (and its source, Summary 15.3.2.22.2) included adverse events 
with an incidence of ≥2% in the reslizumab treatment group rather than adverse events with an 
incidence of ≥2% in either treatment group, as indicated in the table title. The table content has been 
corrected in the CSR erratum provided with this response. 
Adverse events:  
A greater percentage of patients in the reslizumab group (65%) reported adverse events in comparison 
to patients in the placebo group (53%). 
Overall, in the Safety Analysis Set, the system organ classes (SOCs) with adverse events reported 
most frequently (≥8% overall) were Infections and Infestations (39% overall); Respiratory, Thoracic 
and Mediastinal Disorders (14% overall); General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (9% 
overall); Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (8% overall); and Nervous System 
Disorders (8% overall) (Summary 15.3.2.2.1).  
SOCs in which more adverse events were reported in the reslizumab group compared with the placebo 
group (at least 5% higher) were Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal (placebo 11% and reslizumab 
17%); General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (placebo 6% and reslizumab 13%); and 
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (placebo 4% and reslizumab 11%). 
The most commonly reported adverse events (≥5% in either treatment group) were viral upper 
respiratory tract infection, asthma, bronchitis, hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, 
headache, influenza, injection site pain, and rhinitis allergic. A summary of commonly reported adverse 
events (≥2% in either treatment group) is presented in Table 26. 
Events that occurred more frequently in the reslizumab group compared with the placebo group (at 
least 5% higher) were viral upper respiratory tract infection (13% and 6%, respectively) and rhinitis 
allergic (5% and 0%, respectively). 
Events that occurred more frequently in the placebo group compared with the reslizumab group (at 
least 5% higher) included hypertension (6% and 1%, respectively) and upper respiratory tract 
infection (6% and 1%, respectively).

Assessment of the response 
The MAH submitted the requested Summary 15.  
The affected items concerned the PRO and adverse events sections; relevant sections will be discussed 
hereunder.  
PRO 
The submitted summary data confirmed the initially data provided. No changes are made in the 
assessment.  
Although some small differences were observed between subgroups, no conclusions can be drawn 
given the primary analysis was not met and the small number of patients in some subgroups.  
Incidence of Adverse Events 
The MAH also submitted corrected results of the adverse events. Following events are added compared 
to the previous table: 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 44/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
As adverse events are added with a higher frequency in placebo group than in reslizumab group, the 
overall conclusion is not affected by this addition.  
Issue resolved.

Synopsis of Report CP-17-15: 
Report Title: 
Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling in Support of the Reslizumab Subcutaneous Administration 
Development Program in Pediatric, Adolescent, and Adult Patients 
Objectives: 
The goal of this analysis was to establish a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model to describe the PK 
of reslizumab, including an assessment of the effects of baseline demographic characteristics (including 
organ function), concomitant medications, and the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) on the PK 
of reslizumab following intravenous (iv) or subcutaneous (sc) administration. 
The objectives of the population PK analyses described herein were to: 
 Up d a t e  a n d  r e fin e  t h e  p r e v io u s ly  d e v e lo p e d  p o p u la t io n  PK m o d e l fo r  r e s liz u m a b  u s in g  p r io r

Data Description: 
Data from 6 Phase 1 studies (I96-350, P01942, C38072/1102, C38072/1107, C38072-AS-10069, 
C38072-PK-10071), 2 Phase 2 studies (P00290 and Res-5-0010), and 4 Phase 3 studies 
(C38072/3081, C38072/3082, C38072-AS-30025, and C38072-AS-30027) were pooled for the 
population PK analysis of reslizumab. Participants in Phase 1 Studies C38072/1102 and C38072/1107 
were healthy non-Japanese and Japanese men and women. Participants in Phase 1 Study C38072-PK-
10071 were healthy adult men and women. Participants in Phase 1 Study C38072-AS-10069 were 
children (6 to <12 years of age) with asthma. Participants in Phase 1 Study I96-350 were adult men 
and women with severe asthma. Participants in Phase 1 Study P01942 were adult men and women 
with nasal polyps. Participants in Phase 2 Studies P00290 and Res-5-0010 were adult men and 
women with moderate to severe asthma that was not well controlled. Participants in Phase 3 Studies 
C38072/3081 and C38072/3082 were men and women, aged 12 to 75 years with eosinophilic asthma 
(blood eosinophil count ≥400/μL). Participants in Phase 3 Study C38072-AS-30025 were men and 
women >12 years of age with uncontrolled asthma (blood eosinophil count ≥300/μL). Participants in 
Phase 3 Study C38072-AS-30027 were men and women >12 years of age with corticosteroid 
dependent asthma (blood eosinophil count ≥300/μL).

Dose Administration: 
A single dose of iv reslizumab was given in Phase 1 Study I96-350 (0.03 mg/kg iv bolus, 0.1 mg/kg iv 
bolus, 0.3 mg/kg iv infusion, or 1 mg/kg iv infusion), Phase 1 Study P01942 (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg iv 
infusion), and in one dose arm of Phase 1 Study C38072/1107 (220 mg iv infusion). In Phase 1 Study 
C38072/1102, 5 iv doses of reslizumab were given 4 weeks apart (0.3, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg iv infusion). 
In Phase 2 Study P00290, 2 iv doses of reslizumab were given 12 weeks apart (0.3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg 
iv infusion). Four iv doses of reslizumab were given 4 weeks apart in Studies Res-5-0010 (3 mg/kg iv 
infusion) and C38072/3081 (0.3 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg iv infusion). In Study C38072/3082 (3.0 mg/kg 
iv infusion), 13 doses of iv reslizumab were given 4 weeks apart. Generally, the duration of iv infusions 
ranged from 20 to 50 minutes, but may have varied from subject to subject. A single dose of sc 
reslizumab was given in Phase 1 Study C38072-AS-10069 (33, 110, or 165 mg administered in the 
upper arm). A single dose of sc reslizumab was given in Phase 1 Study C38072-PK-10071 (55, 110, or 
220 mg administered in the upper arm; 110 mg administered in the abdomen; 110 mg administered in 
the thigh). A single dose of sc reslizumab was given in one dose arm of Phase 1 Study C38072/1107 
(220 mg sc administered in the upper arm). In Study C38072-AS-30025, 13 doses of sc reslizumab 
(110 mg sc) were given 4 weeks apart; sequential administration via the upper arm, abdomen, and 
thigh was repetitively used for each consecutive dose (patients were assigned to 1 of 3 different dose 
arms, each beginning the dosing sequence at 1 of the 3 differentanatomical injection sites). In Study 
C38072-AS-30027 (110 mg sc administered in the upper arm), 6 doses of sc reslizumab were given 4 
weeks apart. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis Methodology: The overall procedures followed for the 
development of the population PK model for reslizumab were: 
1) exploratory data analysis; 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 47/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2) base structural model development via application and refinement of previously developed final 
population PK model using prior iv data pooled with sc data from Studies C38072-AS-10069, C38072-
PK-10071, and C38072-AS-30027; 3) evaluation of covariate effects using forward selection; 4) full 
multivariable model evaluation (including application, re-estimation, and refinement of PK model using 
dataset updated with Study C38072-AS-30025 data); 
5) backward elimination of covariates (including all available iv/sc data); 
6) final model refinement; 
and 7) model evaluation. 
Stationary covariates evaluated were age, race, sex, baseline body weight, baseline body mass index, 
baseline renal function, baseline liver function tests, baseline serum albumin, baseline peripheral blood 
eosinophil count, patient status, and ADA status. Time varying concomitant medications evaluated 
were beta-agonists, leukotriene antagonists, and oral or injectable corticosteroid classes. The final PK 
model was validated using a simulation based, prediction-corrected  VPC methodology to assess 
concordance between the model based simulated data and the observed data. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis Results: 
A total of 12906 serum reslizumab concentration measurements from 1057 subjects (10438 
concentrations from 816 subjects receiving iv reslizumab and 2468 concentrations from 241 subjects 
receiving sc reslizumab) were used for development of the base population PK model and covariate 
forward selection procedure. After inclusion of Study C38072-AS-30025 data, a total of 15020 serum 
reslizumab concentration measurements from 1293 subjects (10438 concentrations from 816 subjects 
receiving iv reslizumab and 4582 concentrations from 477 subjects receiving sc reslizumab) were used 
for the covariate backward elimination procedure and final population PK model development. In total, 
the analysis population used for thefinal population PK model included 249 healthy volunteers from 
Phase 1 Studies C38072/1102, C38072/1107, and C38072-PK-10071; 36 pediatric patients from Phase 
1 Study C38072-AS-10069; 40 patients from Phase 1 Studies I96-350 and P01942; 196 patients from 
Phase 2 Studies P00290 and Res-5-0010; 450 patients from Phase 3 Studies C38072/3081 and 
C38072/3082; and 322 patients from Phase 3 Studies C38072-AS-30025 and C38072-AS-30027. The 
final analysis dataset included 79 patients between 12 and 17 years of age, inclusive, with the 
remainder of patients ranging in age from 18 to 83 years (median: 43 years). The analysis population 
was primarily Caucasian (78%), with relatively equivalent gender distributions (44.5% male, 55.5% 
female). 
The final population PK model for reslizumab was a 2-compartment model with zero order input for iv 
doses, firstorder absorption for sc doses (with absolute bioavailability [F1] estimated separately for 
Study C38072/1107 versus all other sc data), and first order elimination. Interindividual variability was 
estimated for the first-order absorption rate constant (Ka), clearance (CL), central volume of 
distribution (Vc), distributional clearance (Q), and peripheral volume of distribution (Vp), which were 
each described using an exponential error model. The residual variability (RV) was estimated using 
separate log error models applied to full profile iv data (Studies I96-350, P01942, C38072/1102, 
C38072/1107, and P0290), Phase 2/3 sparse iv data (Studies Res-5-0010, C38072/3081, and 
C38072/3082), full profile sc data (Studies C38072-AS-10069, C38072-PK-10071, and C38072/1107), 
and Phase 3 sparse sc data (Studies C38072-AS-30025 and C38072-AS-30027). 
Covariate analysis identified body weight as a significant predictor of F1, CL, Vc, and Vp, and age as a 
significant predictor of F1. Each covariate effect was described according to a power function. Based on 
the equations provided below, the typical CL, Vc, and Vp parameter values are predicted to increase 
less than proportionally with increasing body weight, while the typical F1 is predicted to decrease less 
than proportionally with increasing body weight and increasing age. No other covariates were found to 
be significant descriptors of variability in reslizumab PK.

The final PK model parameter estimates and their associated precisions (%RSE) are presented in the 
table below. All fixed effect parameters (cardinal PK and covariate effect parameters) and random 
effect parameters (interindividual variability [IIV] and RV) were estimated with good precision (%RSE ≤
20.5% and ≤30.0%, respectively). Using body weights representative of the 5th and 95th percentiles 
observed in this analysis dataset population, the typical CL, Vc, and Vp would range from 5.62 mL/h, 
2359 mL, and 1784 mL, respectively, for a subject weighing 48 kg up to 8.90 mL/h, 3974 mL, and 
2454 mL, respectively, for a subject weighing 109 kg. The mean apparent terminal elimination half life 
for a typical subject based upon final population mean parameter estimates is estimated at 
approximately 23 days.

The prediction-corrected VPC model evaluation indicated that overall, as well as by study, the central 
tendency in the reslizumab concentration time-course and the magnitude of variability is being 
described well by the final population PK model.

The Population Pharmacokinetic Conclusions: 
 Th e  PK o f r e s liz u m a b  in  h e a lt h y  v o lu n t e e r s  a n d  p a t ie n t s  w it h  e o s in o p h ilic  a s t h m a ,  n a s a l p o ly p o s is ,  
uncontrolled asthma, or oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma ranging in age from 6 to 83 years were 
well characterized by a 2-compartment model with zero order input for iv dosing, first-order absorption 
(with absolute bioavailability) for sc dosing, and first-order elimination kinetics. 
 Dis e a s e  s t a t u s  is  u n lik e ly  t o  in flu e n c e  r e s liz u m a b  PK,  a s  t h e  PK p a r a m e t e r  e s t im a t e s  a n d  p r e d ict e d

 Th e  m o d e l-estimated typical values of CL, Vc, and Vp for a 73 kg subject were 7.11 mL/h, 3080 mL, 
and 2100 mL, respectively, resulting in a population mean t½ of approximately 559 hours or 23.3  
days. 
 Bo d y  w e ig h t  w a s  id e n t ifie d  a s  a  s t a t is t ic a lly  s ig n ifica n t  p r e d ic t o r  o f CL,  Vc ,  a n d  Vp ,  w it h  e a c h  PK 
parameter increasing in a less than proportional manner with increasing body weight, such that the 
typical CL, Vc, and Vp are predicted to increase by approximately 58% (from 5.62 mL/h to 8.90 mL/h), 
68% (from 2359 mL to 3974 mL), and 38% (from 1784 mL to 2454 mL), respectively, as subject 
weights range from the 5th percentile (48 kg) to 95th percentile (109 kg) of body weight observed in 
the PK analysis population. 
 Bo d y  w e ig h t  a n d  a g e  w e r e  id e n t ifie d  a s  s t a t is t ic a lly  s ig n ific a n t  p r e d ic t o r s  o f F1 ,  w it h  F1  d e c r e a s in g  in  
a less than proportional manner with increasing body weight or increasing age. Based on the combined 
influence of both covariates and using the 5th and 95th percentiles of observed age and body weight in 
the sc population, the typical F1 is predicted to decrease by approximately 53%, from 0.70 in a 9-
year-old subject weighing 35 kg to 0.33 in a 70-year-old subject weighing 106 kg. 
 S e x ,  r a c e  ( w h it e ,  b la c k  o r  Afr ic a n -American, Asian, and other), baseline renal function (normal to 
moderately decreased), baseline liver function tests (normal and Grade 1/2 elevation), serum albumin, 
baseline peripheral eosinophil count, and concomitant use of beta agonists, leukotriene antagonists, or 
corticosteroids were not found to be significant sources of IIV in reslizumab PK. The lack of a sufficient 
number of subjects in the analysis dataset with very poor renal function or high grades (3-4) of 
elevated liver function tests prevented an assessment of the impact of more severe renal or hepatic 
impairment on reslizumab PK. 
 Th e  c o v a r ia t e  a n a ly s is  showed that the presence of circulating ADAs did not significantly alter the 
disposition of reslizumab. 
Assessment of the response 
The MAH submitted the requested Report CP-17-15 including the population pharmacokinetic analysis 
including pharmacokinetic date  from 6 Phase 1 studies (I96-350, P01942, C38072/1102, 
EMA/847608/2018  
Page 51/53 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
C38072/1107, C38072-AS-10069, C38072-PK-10071), 2 Phase 2 studies (P00290 and Res-5-0010), 
and 4 Phase 3 studies (C38072/3081, C38072/3082, C38072-AS-30025, and C38072-AS-30027). 
The PK of reslizumab following iv infusion, iv bolus injection, or sc injection demonstrated linear 
elimination over the dose ranges of 0.03 to 3.0 mg/kg for iv and 33 to 220 mg for sc. The disposition 
of reslizumab was well described by a 2-compartment model with zero-order input for iv dosing, first-
order absorption with absolute bioavailability for sc dosing, and first-order elimination kinetics. The 
magnitude of estimated random, unexplained IIV in CL and Vc reflects the moderate range expected 
(32.5 and 26.2 %CV, respectively), particularly given the different routes of administration, the wide 
range of ages and body weights in the analysis population, and in light of the amount of observed 
between-subject variability in both the observed full PK profiles as well as in the sparse PK data.  
With the exception of body weight and age, all other covariates that were explored either did not 
achieve statistical significance or did not sufficiently explain (ie, reduce) a considerable proportion of 
IIV (at least 5%) on the PK parameter tested. 
In this analysis population, neither baseline mild or moderate renal impairment nor baseline elevated 
liver function tests (Grade 1-2) were associated with altered reslizumab PK. Which is in line whith the 
expected monoclonal antibody characteristics of reslizumab. The presence of circulating ADA against 
reslizumab did not seem to result in or produce decreases in reslizumab exposures. 
The only concomitant medication classes with sufficient prevalence in this PK population to allow 
meaningful analysis were the beta agonists, leukotriene antagonists, and corticosteroids. None of these 
co-administered classes were identified as a significant covariate for reslizumab PK; this is in line with 
the expectation that small-molecule drugs would not impact reslizumab PK. 
The population typical values of CL, Vc, and Vp were best described by power functions of body weight. 
The estimates of the power term values were fairly similar for each PK parameter (0.560 for CL, 0.636 
for Vc, and 0.389 for Vp) indicating that the typical values of CL, Vc, and Vp all increase in a less-than-
proportional manner with increasing body weight. In general the t½ remaine unchanged over the 
observed body weight range evaluated in this analysis population. 
However, increasing body weight for a given fixed dose amount, results in reduced reslizumab serum 
exposures regardless of route of administration. For sc-dosed drug, the model-predicted effects of 
body weight and age on F1 (each producing a reduction in F1 with increasing body weight and/or 
advancing age) suggest a considerably higher absolute bioavailability for lighter and younger patients. 
In turn, reslizumab exposures are predicted to be proportionally lower in older and particularly heavier 
patients. 
The POP-PK analysis is of sufficient quality. The findings in this report do not influence the overall 
clinical outcome. The submitted summary data confirmed the initially data provided. No changes are 
made in the assessment.

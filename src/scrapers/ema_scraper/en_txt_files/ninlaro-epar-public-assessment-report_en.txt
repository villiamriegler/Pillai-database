2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal disease of plasma cells that results in bone marrow failure, bone 
destruction, hypercalcaemia, anaemia, infection, renal failure, and neurological symptoms. It 
constitutes approximately 1% of all reported neoplasms and 13% of hematologic cancers worldwide 
(Palumbo A, 2011). In Europe, the estimated annual incidence is 38,930 new cases with approximately 
24,290 deaths and the incidence is expected to increase over the next decade (Ferlay J, 2013). 
Prognosis varies considerably on the basis of several factors, including the presence of cytogenetic 
abnormalities (Rajkumar 2011). MM with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, del(17), t(14;16) and/or 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 8/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
t(4;14), is characterized by short survival related to an early relapse rate and rapid development of 
mechanisms of resistance to multiple agents. Del(17), typically considered the ultra-high-risk group 
occurs in approximately 10-12% of patients with Refractory/Relapsed Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) (Avet-
Loiseau 2010; 2012). 
Treatment with cytotoxic drugs, such as alkylating agents and anthracyclines, and corticosteroids, was 
given in the past until the introduction of the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor (PI), bortezomib, and 
the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), thalidomide and lenalidomide that led to improved outcomes. 
First line treatment options contain at least one of the novel therapies, i.e. proteasome inhibitors 
and/or immunostimulatory drugs, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), if indicated. 
Depth of response after autologous transplantation appears to correlate with the duration of disease 
control before disease progression occurs with the need for salvage therapy.  In EU, bortezomib, 
thalidomide (as first line treatment) and lenalidomide are authorised in combination regimens for the 
treatment of multiple myeloma.   
In the relapsed and/or refractory patients, bortezomib- and lenalidomide-based regimens are the most 
commonly used in combination with corticosteroids, to which sometimes also an alkylator or an 
anthracycline is added. In this setting, for patients who have received at least 2 prior therapies, 
including bortezomib and an IMiD, and have shown relapsed or refractory disease, pomalidomide (in 
combination with dexamethasone) and panobinostat (in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone) are approved agents in the EU. The proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib and the 
monoclonal antibody elotuzumab both in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone were 
approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at 
least one prior therapy.  
Ixazomib citrate, a prodrug, is the drug substance that rapidly hydrolyses under physiological 
conditions to its biologically active form, ixazomib. Ixazomib is an oral, highly selective and reversible 
proteasome inhibitor. Ixazomib preferentially binds and inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 
beta 5 subunit of the 20S proteasome. 
Ixazomib induced apoptosis of several tumour cell types in vitro. Ixazomib demonstrated in vitro 
cytotoxicity against myeloma cells from patients who had relapsed after multiple prior therapies, 
including bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. The combination of ixazomib and 
lenalidomide demonstrated synergistic cytotoxic effects in multiple myeloma cell lines. In vivo, 
ixazomib demonstrated antitumour activity in various tumour xenograft models, including models of 
multiple myeloma. In vitro, ixazomib affected cell types found in the bone marrow microenvironment 
including vascular endothelial cells, osteoclasts and osteoblasts. 
The sponsor applied for the following indication: Ninlaro is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
During the evaluation, the applicant revised the proposed indication as follows: NINLARO in 
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
multiple myeloma who have:  
- experienced at least one relapse with ISS stage III disease or elevated-risk cytogenetics [del(17), 
t(4;14), t(14;16), or 1q21+]; or 
- experienced at least 2 relapses.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules. The capsules contain 2.3 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg 
ixazomib (as 3.3 mg, 4.3 mg and 5.7 mg ixazomib citrate, respectively). 
As described in section 6.1 of the SmPC, other ingredients are: 
Capsule contents: microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and talc; 
Capsule shell: gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide (black, red and/or yellow iron oxide 
depending on capsule colour) (E172); 
Printing ink: shellac, propylene glycol, potassium hydroxide, black iron oxide (E172). 
Capsules are individually packaged in a PVC-Aluminium/ Aluminium blister sealed inside a wallet pack 
as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of ixazomib citrate is 2-[(1R)-1-[[2-[(2,5- dichlorobenzoyl) amino]acetyl]amino]-3-
methylbutyl]-5-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaborolane-4,4-diacetic acid corresponding to the molecular formula 
C20H23BCl2N2O9 and has a relative molecular mass of 517.12 g/mol. Ixazomib citrate has the following 
structure (Figure 1): 
Figure 1 . Molecular structure of ixazomib citrate. 
The active substance, ixazomib citrate, is a pro-drug of ixazomib. Under physiological conditions 
ixazomib citrate rapidly hydrolyses to ixazomib, which is a boronic acid of the general structure R-
B(OH)2.  
Ixazomib citrate is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic powder, with a melting point ~ 231oC (with 
decomposition). Based on its high solubility and low permeability, ixazomib is a BCS Class 3 
compound. Studies showed that ixazomib is highly soluble across a broad aqueous pH range that 
includes thephysiological pH range (1.2 to 6.85). The pKa and logP of ixazomib citrate could not be 
determined due to the hydrolysis of ixazomib citrate to ixazomib in aqueous systems.   
The structure of ixazomib citrate has been confirmed by IR spectroscopy, high resolution mass 
spectrometry, elemental analysis, UV-Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray crystallography. 1H- 
and 13C-NMR and mass spectroscopy demonstrated that ixazomib citrate exists as the cyclic citrate 
ester structure in anhydrous, aprotic solvents, and that the ester rapidly hydrolyzes to ixazomib 
(boronic acid) in dilute aqueous solutions in the absence of excess citric acid. Supplementary NMR 
Assessment report

Page 10/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experiments confirmed the rapid kinetics of ixazomib citrate hydrolysis and the favored ixazomib 
equilibrium once exposed to aqueous conditions.  
The structure of ixazomib citrate contains one chiral centre.  The absolute stereochemistry of ixazomib 
citrate at the single chiral centre has been unambiguously determined as R. Enantiomeric purity of the 
active substance is controlled by NP-HPLC and acceptance limit of this specification has been set at 
< 0.5%.  
A number of polymorphic crystal forms of ixazomib citrate were identified and characterized. One has 
been identified as the most thermodynamically stable form and was selected for development and 
commercial manufacture.  This form has been demonstrated to be consistently manufactured by the 
proposed manufacturer using a controlled crystallization procedure. Polymorphism is controlled in the 
active substance specification by XRPD. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The proposed synthesis of ixazomib citrate comprises a sequence commencing with the separate 
synthesis of two key intermediates. These intermediates are then combined and elaborated to yield 
ixazomib citrate.  
The proposed starting materials are accepted as suitable starting materials for regulatory purposes. 
The proposed starting materials are well characterised and relatively simple molecules, which require a 
number of discrete synthetic steps  interspersed with isolated intermediates, to prepare the active 
substance. As a result, there is sufficient opportunity for purging impurities or synthetic by-products. 
Comprehensive manufacturing development studies have been performed; an understanding of the 
nature and fate of impurities has been demonstrated. SM1 is a potential source of genotoxic impurities 
which has been adequately addressed by the applicant.  
Three critical steps were identified as part of the quality risk assessment and appropriate controls were 
developed to maintain the consistency of the process and the quality of the active substance. Adequate 
in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
Key process intermediates that fail to achieve the desired product quality or due to process deviation 
may be reprocessed according to a described reprocessing procedure. The proposed reprocessing 
procedure was considered acceptable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. A comprehensive description of the nature and origin of 
impurities has been provided, including those impurities identified as potential genotoxins. The purity 
profile is well described, including enantiomeric purity and residual solvents. A section has been 
devoted to the discussion on genotoxic impurities, since there are numerous structural alerts. Their 
limits are based on TTC approach according to ICH M7.  
The manufacturing process was developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies and 
elements of QbD, such as risk assessment and multivariate design of experiments (DoE). Based on 
these studies, criticality of process parameters of the synthesis was assessed. Proven acceptable 
ranges (PARs) have been defined for these critical process parameters. Upon request, further details 
about DoE, risk assessment and data used for defining the PARs were provided and considered 
acceptable. 
The manufacturing process for the active substance evolved during development. A number of 
syntheses  were developed sequentially; all of which shared the same bond-forming sequence and had 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 11/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar impurity profiles.  Differences between processes are minor.  As a result, active substance 
produced by earlier processes are accepted as similar to the process proposed for commercialisation.   
The primary container for the active substance  was adequately described. Upon request, a 
specification for the primary bag used for bulk packaging was updated to include a specific 
identification test. Satisfactory declarations of compliance with EU Regulation 10/2011 and its 
amendments as well as the general requirements for food contact material, have been provided 
confirming its suitability.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identity (FTIR, NP-HPLC), 
assay (RP-HPLC), impurities (RP-HPLC), enantiomeric Impurity (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), 
water content (KF), ixazomib content (HPLC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), particle size (laser 
diffraction) and polymorphic form (XRPD).  
For the control of particle size, following the request from the CHMP, the applicant introduced a multi-
point control. Since ixazomib citrate is sensitive to hydrolysis, water content is carefully controlled as 
part of the active substance specification.  
Upon request of the CHMP, the applicant committed to develop and validate a new test method for 
controlling residual solvents and introduce a specification limit, in line with ICH Q3C(R5), in the active 
substance specification by the end of 2016. This specification will be applied to all GMP lots of ixazomib 
citrate used to manufacture commercial finished product for EU supply.  
The specification proposed for the active substance manufacturer is acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
source and quality of the reference standards used for active substance and impurities has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis data from development (n= 2), clinical (n=12) and process performance qualification 
lots (n=3) of the active substance are provided.  All batches were manufactured at the intended 
commercial manufacturing site. Comparative batch analysis data from active substance manufactured 
by earlier processes in addition to that proposed for commercialisation was presented.  As indicated 
above, data lots manufactured by earlier processes are considered representative of the proposed 
commercial process. Batch analytical data for all lots are consistent from batch to batch and comply 
with the proposed specification. 
Stability 
Stability data on six commercial scale batches of active substance manufactured by the proposed 
synthetic route stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions at 5oC and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions at 25oC/60%RH, according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. This was 
supplemented by up to 36 months stability data at 5oC on two clinical batches produced using earlier 
processes.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurities, enantiomeric impurity, ixazomib 
content, particle size distribution, polymorphic form and microbial enumeration tests. The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
Under all storage conditions, minor variability but no significant changes were observed for any of the 
parameters tested.

Forced degradation studies have been performed on one batch. Samples were exposed to stress 
conditions including heat at 40oC and 50oC and humidity (open-dish) at 25oC/60%RH and 
25oC/75%RH.Test parameters comprised assay, total impurities, water content, ixazomib content and 
particle size distribution.  No significant changes were observed in any test parameter under these 
conditions.  
A photostability study were performed in line with ICH guideline Q1B was also performed.  Other than 
an apparent minor increase in an unspecified impurity from “not detected” to 0.06%, no change to any 
other test parameter was observed. Therefore, it is confirmed that ixazomib citrate is not sensitive to 
light.   
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability data presented justify the proposed retest period of 48 months, when 
packaged in the proposed container and stored at 5oC.   
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Ninlaro is an immediate-release hard capsule formulation available in three strengths containing 2.3 
mg, 3 mg or 4 mg of ixazomib (as ixazomib citrate). The different strengths are differentiated by the 
colour of the capsule (flesh/light pink for the 2.3 mg capsules; light grey for the 3 mg and light orange 
for the 4 mg capsules) and the printing.  
As described in section 6.1 of the SmPC, other ingredients are: 
Capsule contents: microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and talc; 
Capsule shell: gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide (black, red and/or yellow iron oxide 
depending on capsule colour) (E172); 
Printing ink: shellac, propylene glycol, potassium hydroxide, black iron oxide (E172). 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release oral dosage form 
containing 2.3 mg, 3.0 mg or 4.0 mg of ixazomib, with a shelf life of 3 years, to be administered once 
a day on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle and that meets compendial and other relevant quality 
standards. 
The critical quality attributes identified were: appearance, identification, assay, uniformity of dosage 
units, purity, dissolution, water content, polymorphic form and particle size. Ixazomib citrate is a 
stable citrate ester, which, under physiological conditions, undergoes rapid hydrolysis to the 
biologically active boronic acid, ixazomib. The physicochemical attributes of the active substance, 
considered to impact the quality and manufacturability of the finished product, were taken in 
consideration during development.  
Excipient choice is typical of solid oral dosage forms; all are controlled to the relevant Ph. Eur. 
monographs with supplementary in-house specifications where relevant.  
Satisfactory excipient compatibility studies have been described as part of formulation development. 
Studies were conducted to confirm the excipient selection that could improve the manufacturability. 
Prototypes were made in gelatin shells with ixazomib citrate and the excipients to establish the final 
components and were placed on stability for 6 weeks at 40 °C/75% RH. The excipients chosen based 
on the best stability and manufacturability were microcrystaline cellulose, talc, and magnesium 
stearate.

The history of ixazomib capsules manufacturing process development including detailed information on 
the formulation was presented by the applicant. Blending optimisation studies were performed to 
define a robust blending process.  
Three dosage forms have been used for phase 1 studies: ixazomib injection for iv use, ixazomib for 
injection, and an oral capsule. The solid oral capsule dose strengths 0.2, 0.5, and 2.0 mg were 
introduced to allow the patients to take multiple capsules in the multiple-rising dose studies. 
During phase 1 clinical trials, studies were initiated to improve the stability and the manufacturability 
of the ixazomib capsule formulation.  
Two capsules shell types were studied for use in the drug product. Drug product made with both types 
of capsules shells was stored in closed-bottle conditions. Both types of capsules showed similar 
ixazomib content over time; however, the gelatin capsules were more stable in accelerated conditions, 
with respect to related substances. Therefore, the gelatin capsule shells were selected.  
Since one of the goals on the QTPP was to develop a single dose unit for patients, before the final dose 
strengths were determined for the pivotal clinical studies, the range of drug loads possible in the 
intended capsule size for this product was determined, and the blending operations for this range were 
optimized.  
Several capsule color and ink options were also evaluated. They showed no effect on the ixazomib 
capsule stability, and based on these results the colour and ink to be used in the commercial 
presentations was chosen. 
Two dissolution methods have been developed. The first was validated and used throughout product 
development and registration stability studies to gather information about drug product release and 
stability. A more discriminatory dissolution method was developed and validated for routine quality 
control use. The method is accepted, as comparative dissolution profiles for all phase 3 pivotal clinical 
lots, and an assessment of discrimination, have been provided by both methodologies.  
The primary packaging is PVC-Aluminium/Aluminium blister. A description of the container closure 
components along with their specifications has been provided. For the primary packaging, the applicant 
has presented declarations of conformance with EU Directive 10/2011, as amended for food contact 
and the relevant requirements of the Ph. Eur. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process comprises blendingof the active substance with the excipients, followed by 
encapsulation and packaging. For all finished product presentations, the % content of active substance 
ranges exceeds 2%, thus this process may be considered to be standard.  
Manufacturing process parameters requiring control have been identified and are considerd sufficient to 
control the quality of the finished product.  
Product specification 
The control specifications for the finished product at release and end of shelf-life include appropriate 
tests and limits for this kind of dosage form including: appearance (visual), identification (UV, HPLC), 
assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water content (KF), content uniformity (HPLC), dissolution 
(Ph. Eur.)  and microbial control (Ph. Eur.).  
Control limits at end of shelf-life are equivalent to those at batch release with the exception of 
specified, unspecified and total related substances.

Upon request, the applicant tightened both the release and shelf-life specification for total impurities. 
Satisfactory controls for microbial enumeration have been proposed in line with Ph. Eur. 
recommendations for non-sterile products.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing 
The non-compendial analytical procedures for Ixazomib capsules have been validated in line with 
CPMP/ICH/381/95 (Validation of analytical procedures: Text and Methodology Q2 (R1)). Satisfactory 
information regarding the source and quality of the reference standards used in release and stability 
testing of ixazomib capsules has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for a total of twenty-seven lots (nine lots of each dosage strength), which confirm 
compliance to the proposed control specification have been presented. All test results showed 
consistency within and between batches. 
Stability of the product 
Up to twenty-four months long term (5oC, 25oC/60%RH and 30oC/75%RH) and six months accelerated 
(40oC/75%RH) stability data for a total of nine commercial scale batches (three lots of each dosage 
strength), have been presented. The batches of Ninlaro are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
This was supplemented by up to 36 months stability data for clinical batches of 2.3, 3.0 and 4.0 mg 
ixazomib capsules stored at 5oC, 25oC/60%RH and 30oC/75%RH), and 6 months data under 
accelerated (40oC/75%RH) conditions. Clinical lots differ from registration lots only in minor aspects 
relating to screening steps during manufacture and the absence of an ink imprint on the capsule. All 
stability lots were manufactured at the proposed site for commercial manufacture (Haupt Pharma 
Amareg GmbH).   
Storage conditions and stability time points conform to those of ICH guidance. Stability-indicating test 
parameters included appearance, identity, assay, related substances (including enantiomeric impurity), 
water content, dissolution, disintegration and microbial enumeration tests.  The same analytical 
methods as proposed for commercial use were proposed, except for dissolution where the earlier 
method was used to generate the majority of data. Since comparable batch analysis data was 
provided, and neither of the dissolution media contains surfactant and conditions are not aggressive, 
the change in dissolution methodology during stability studies to that proposed for routine QC control 
of dissolution was deemed acceptable. 
No significant change was observed in any of the parameters tested. Although for all strengths 
specified degradation products increased slightly over time under long term and accelerated storage 
conditions, the levels remained well below the proposed commercial specification. Therefore, the 
registration stability studies demonstrated that the 2.3, 3.0 and 4.0 mg ixazomib capsules remain 
within specification limits for all attributes for the duration of the proposed 36 month shelf-life at the 
proposed storage condition of “not more than 30oC. Do not freeze”. 
A long-term stability study on one batch of each strength, has also been conducted to confirm stability 
of the bulk packaged capsules at the long-term storage condition of 5 °C. Capsules were packaged for 
24 months in the bulk packaging configuration. Samples were tested using the registration test 
methods for appearance, assay, related substances and water content and additional methods for 
ixazomib content, enantiomeric impurity, and disintegration. Data demonstrate that the capsules 
remain unchanged when stored for 24 months under long-term (5 °C) storage conditions, which 
support a 24-month bulk hold time.  
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 15/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products.  Samples were tested for appearance, 
assay, related substances, ixazomib content and dissolution. No significant changes were observed in 
appearance, assay, ixazomib content and dissolution. A difference in related substances was observed 
between the control and exposed samples in both the 2.3 and 3.0 mg presentation (0.05 vs 0.08% in 
the control sample and in the exposed sample, respectively). Given the low level of the degradant and 
the understanding that it did not change in the ixazomib citrate photostability study, the presence of 
this degradation product was attributed to analytical variability rather than an actual material 
sensitivity to light. Levels of specified degradation products and impurity remained unchanged. The 
results confirmed that the product is not photolabile.  
Stress stability studies were conducted on one batch of each dosage strength. Samples were exposed 
to high temperatures (50 °C and 60 °C) or high humidity (25 °C/60% RH and 25 °C/75% RH). No 
significant changes from initial appearance, assay, ixazomib content or dissolution were observed for 
the samples stored for up to 6 weeks under the above mentioned conditions. Some increase in total 
impurities was observed over the course of the studies at high temperatures but remained well below 
the proposed acceptance criteria, indicating that the capsules can tolerate some exposure to high heat. 
An increase in water content and in turn an increase in impurities was observed under humidity, 
indicating that ixazomib capsules should be protected from moisture. 
Freeze cycling and heat cycling studies were also conducted on one batch from each strength packaged 
in the PVC-Al/Al blister, to evaluate the effects of temperature excursions on packaged capsules. For 
the freeze cycling study, samples were held at 0 °C for 3 days followed by a 3 day hold at 25 °C/60% 
RH for each cycle. For the heat cycling study, samples were held at 50 °C for 3 days followed by a 3 
day hold at 25 °C/60% RH for each cycle. A total of 3 freezing or heat cycles were performed, with 
analysis for appearance, assay, related substances, water content and ixazomib content conducted at 
the conclusion of each cycle. No significant changes were observed at any of the conditions tested. 
Although an increase in water content was observed over multiple heating cycles, it remained below 
the specification limit.      
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and storage condition of “not 
more than 30oC. Do not freeze”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
The only animal-derived material used in ixazomib capsules is the gelatin of the capsule shells. The 
gelatin can be from bovine and porcine sources. Valid TSE CEP from the supplier of the gelatine used in 
the manufacture is provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Ixazomib citrate is a new chemical entity. The active substance contained in Ninlaro, ixazomib citrate, 
is an ester prodrug, which rapidly hydrolyses to ixazomib under physiological conditions. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and there in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the proposed SmPC. Physiochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
To develop and validate a new test method for controlling residual solvents and update the 
specification for the active substance in line with ICH Q3C(R5) limits by the end of 2016. These 
specifications will be applied to all GMP lots of ixazomib citrate used to manufacture commercial 
finished product for EU supply.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal non-clinical studies were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
regulations. All of the pivotal in vivo non clinical studies were conducted using oral administration.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In Vitro Pharmacodynamics 
Selectivity and potency against the active sites of the 20S  proteasome (Report RPT-01200) 
The IC50 for ixazomib against the 20S proteasome ß1 (caspase-like), ß2 (trypsin-like), and ß5 
(chymotrypsin-like) proteolytic sites was investigated using specific fluorogenic substrates in 
biochemical microtiter plate-based assays (Table 1). The potency and selectivity of ixazomib for the 
proteasome active was also investigated compared to bortezomib (Table 1 ). 
Table 1. Summary of Ixazomib and Bortezomib Enzymology Results

These results were corroborated in a subsequent study, where the inhibitory effects of ixazomib and 
bortezomib against the ß5 and ß2 sites of the proteasome were determined in the human HCT-116 
colorectal tumour cell line (Report MLN9708-28351). Ixazomib and bortezomib showed > 98% 
inhibition of the ß5 activity of the proteasome in this assay (mean IC50 = 0.0075 and 0.0036 µM, 
respectively). Ixazomib and bortezomib inhibited the ß2 activity less potently (mean IC50 = 9.1 and 
0.41 µM, respectively), with ixazomib minimally inhibiting ß2 function. 
The selectivity of ixazomib was also tested against a panel of 7 serine proteases and 2 cysteine 
proteases, as peptidyl boronic acids are known to inhibit other proteases, especially serine proteases, 
in a sequence-dependent manner (Table 2).

Note: Results are reported as geometric mean (95% confidence interval [CI], number of experiments). Data 
without CI are single determinations. 
In additional selectivity screens, ixazomib had no effect on a panel of 103 kinases and 18 receptors 
(neurotransmitter, ion channel, and receptors of the brain and gut), with an IC50 > 10 µM for each.   
The chemical structure of ixazomib contains a chiral centre, with the drug substance determined to be 
the R-enantiomer. The S-enantiomer,  was synthesized separately and evaluated for potency against 
the ß5 site of purified human 20S proteasome. The IC50 of the S-enantiomer in this assay was 0.8245 
µM, with a 95% CI of 0.293, indicating that it is a weaker inhibitor of the proteasome ß5 site than 
ixazomib (IC50 = 3.4 nM) by a factor of more than 200 fold. 
Kinetic analysis of inhibition of the 20S proteasome (Report RPT-01200) 
Ixazomib and bortezomib showed time-dependent inhibition of the 20S proteasome because of the 
formation of a covalent bond between the boronic acid and the hydroxyl of the N-terminal threonine 
side chain.  The binding is reversible, and equilibrium between bound and unbound complexes is 
reached over time (

Note: Results are reported as the mean (95% confidence interval [CI], number of experiments). 
Effects on Proteasome Activity and Degradation of Proteasome Substrates (Report RPT-01200) 
The ability of ixazomib to inhibit the proteasome and prevent proteasome-mediated degradation of 
substrate proteins was further explored in 3 separate cell-based assays. These cell-based assays 
characterized effects of ixazomib by examining the kinetics of inhibition and recovery of ß5 site activity 
in live cells; by examining the effects of ixazomib on a direct proteasome substrate, the 4xUb-
Luciferase reporter; and by examining the effects of ixazomib on the NF- κB signaling pathway, which 
is known to be regulated by proteasome activity. 
Using a cell-based assay to measure the effects of compounds on the ß5 site activity of the 20S 
proteasome in situ, the IC50 for ixazomib and bortezomib after 1 hour of treatment in Calu-6 cells was 
9.7 and 3.0 nM, respectively; these values were comparable, within a 2- to 3-fold range, to those 
determined for purified 20S proteasome in the biochemical assay. 
Recovery of proteasome activity after brief exposure to and washout of ixazomib and bortezomib was 
performed in the same assay system (Table 4).  
The 4xUb-Luc cell-based reporter assay directly monitors the degradation of polyubiquitinated 
luciferase by the proteasome. Bortezomib is slightly more active in this assay than ixazomib (Table 4). 
TNFα induced activation of the NF-κB pathway requires functional proteasome activity to degrade IκBα, 
an inhibitor of NF-κB. Proteasome inhibition prevents the degradation of IκBα and results in a decrease 
in NF-κB -driven gene expression. The NF-κB-Luc assay utilizes a reporter construct that expresses 
luciferase in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Ixazomib almost completely inhibited (99.3%) TNFα-
induced activation of the NF-κB-Luc assay in HEK-293 cells, with an IC50 of 55 nM, compared to IC50 
of 33 nM for bortezomib (Table 4).

The potency and selectivity of ixazomib for proteasome active sites were also evaluated independently 
in vitro in cultured MM.1S cells. In MM.1S cells, ixazomib showed the greatest potency for the ß5 site, 
with an IC50 between 5 and 10 nM, and the least for the ß2 site, with an IC50 > 10 µM. Western blot 
analysis of protein extracts from MM.1S cells treated with 12-nM ixazomib showed  a time- and dose-
dependent increase in ubiquitinated proteins. 
Viability Effects on Cultured or Primary Human Myeloma Cells (Report MLN9708-27528) 
The in vitro viability effects of ixazomib were evaluated in the MM.1S, ANBL-6, RPMI-8226, and NCI-
H929 human myeloma cell lines.  In all cell lines, ixazomib was a potent inhibitor of viability, with 
inhibition occurring in a dose-dependent manner (Table 5).

vitro 
LD50 = concentration causing lethality for 50% of cells; SE = standard error. 
Note: Data from at least 3 and up to 11 independent determinations are displayed as the geometric mean, along

Additionally, the in vitro anti-tumour activity of ixazomib was independently evaluated using MTT 
assays in a variety of cultured human MM cell lines: MM.1S, MM.1R, RPMI-8226, OPM1, OPM2, NCI-
H929, and INA-6. 
The cultured human MM cell lines were assessed for cell viability after treating cells with ixazomib 
(6.25, 12.5, 25, or 50 nM) for 48 hours. A significant concentration-dependent decrease (p <0.05; n = 
3) in cell viability resulted. In MM.1S, MM.1R, and NCI-H929 cells, treatment with 12.5-nM ixazomib 
resulted in approximately 50% loss of viability compared to control cells, while treatment with 25-nM 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016

ixazomib resulted in > 90% loss of viability in these lines and in RPMI-8226 and INA-6. OPM1 and 
OPM2 lines were less sensitive to ixazomib, with only 40% to 50% loss of viability at 25-nM ixazomib. 
A significant dose-dependent decrease (p < 0.001) in viability was also observed after ixazomib 
treatment (12, 25, or 50 nM) for 24 or 48 hours in primary myeloma cells purified by CD138+ 
selection from 6 MM patients, including patients relapsing after previous treatment with bortezomib, 
lenalidomide, and/or dexamethasone. A 24-hour treatment with 25-nM ixazomib resulted in 
approximately 40% loss of viable cells in the 6 patient samples tested, and 50-nM ixazomib resulted in 
at least 70% loss of viable cells in 4 of the 6 patient samples. The effects on viability were greater with 
the 48-hour treatment. These concentrations of ixazomib had a much weaker effect on PBMCs from 
healthy donors. Treatment with 25-nM ixazomib for 48 hours resulted in < 10% loss of viability in 5 of 
6 PBMC samples evaluated and approximately 20% loss in 1 sample. At 50-nM ixazomib, the maximal 
viability loss was approximately 30% in 5 of 6 PBMC samples, with approximately 40% loss in the 
remaining sample.  
Proliferation of MM cells is stimulated by co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells, which provide 
supportive cytokines. Ixazomib inhibited proliferation of MM.1S cells cultured in the presence of bone 
marrow stromal cells, which were derived from CD138- cells purified from bone marrow of MM 
patients. In the presence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), 25-nM ixazomib caused an 
approximately 15-fold decrease in tritiated thymidine uptake compared to control-treated cells, and 
12.5-nM ixazomib also significantly reduced tritiated thymidine uptake, by approximately 2.5-fold.   
Mechanistic Effects on Cellular Pathways in Multiple Myeloma Cell (Chauhan D, et al, 2011) 
The effects of ixazomib on apoptotic signalling pathways were evaluated in vitro in human MM cells 
using Western blot analysis. After ixazomib treatment in NCI-H929 and MM.1S cells, there was an 
increase in proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and PARP, indicating that 
ixazomib triggered both intrinsic mitochondria-dependent (caspase-9) and extrinsic mitochondria-
independent (caspase-8) signalling pathways. Although the complete series of events leading to 
apoptosis of MM cells treated with proteasome inhibitors is not fully characterized, several pathways 
are frequently activated in response to other proteasome inhibitors, including bortezomib; these 
pathways include ER stress/UPR, upregulation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, and p53 activation. 
Ixazomib treatment of MM.1S cells resulted in an increase in protein levels of p53- and p53-regulated 
genes, including p21, which is involved in cell cycle arrest, and the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins 
NOXA and PUMA. Proteasome inhibition triggered by ixazomib also increases levels of the chaperone 
protein BiP, increases the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, and increases levels of the transcription factor 
CHOP, all of which are signs of the UPR. 
Effects of Ixazomib on Additional Cell Types Present in the Bone Marrow Microenvironment (Garcia-
Gomez et al, 2014)  
Ixazomib was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the in vitro formation of capillary-like tube structures 
from HUVECs, a process which provides an in vitro model of angiogenesis. Ixazomib inhibited tube 
formation, as quantitated by the number of branch points per field of view, which decreased by 
approximately 35% in the presence of ixazomib. 
In vitro studies of osteoclastogenesis showed that ixazomib inhibited the formation of osteoclasts from 
precursors in PBMCs of healthy donors and MM patients. These experiments identified concentrations 
of ixazomib (2.5 to 10 nM) which significantly inhibited osteoclast formation without reducing the total 
number of cells, indicating an effect on differentiation of osteoclasts rather than viability. However, a 
higher concentration of ixazomib (25 nM) did decrease total cell number along with osteoclast 
formation. The bone resorptive capacity of osteoclasts was evaluated in vitro in the presence and

absence of ixazomib and bortezomib. Ixazomib reduced calcium resorption at concentrations of ≥2.5 
nM. Bortezomib showed similar effects on osteoclastogenesis in these assays at lower concentrations. 
In vitro studies of osteoblast differentiation and function showed that ixazomib promotes osteoblastic 
differentiation from progenitor cells and stimulates matrix mineralization. Primary MSCs from bone 
marrow of patients with MM were differentiated in osteogenic media in the presence or absence of 
ixazomib or bortezomib. Cells were evaluated for characteristics of osteoblasts including alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) activity, a surrogate marker of early-stage osteoblasts, and matrix mineralization, 
the ability to deposit calcium in the extracellular environment. After 11 days in osteogenic media, ALP 
increased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of ixazomib or bortezomib, with significantly 
increased ALP observed at concentrations of ixazomib of ≥2.5 nM. After 21 days in osteogenic media, 
calcium deposition was increased in the presence of ixazomib or bortezomib.  
Combination effect of ixazomib and lenalidomide on viability of multiple myeloma cell lines grown in 
vitro (Report MLN9708-30663) 
The effect of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide was tested in 4 MM cell lines, MM1.S, ANBL-6, 
RPMI-8226, and NCI-H929. Ixazomib was a potent inhibitor of viability in all cell lines (Table 6). 
Lenalidomide, showed differential potency among 4 cell lines. While lenalidomide induced cell death in 
ANBL-6, NCI-H929, and RPMI-8226, no effect on cell viability was observed in MM1.S at concentrations 
up to approximately 25 µM. 
The combination of ixazomib and lenalidomide was synergistic in ANBL-6 and NCI-H929 cells and 
additive in MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells. The synergistic and additive categories were determined by 
using 2 types of combination measures, combination index and nonlinear blending.  
Table 6. Summary of Single Agent and Combination Measures with Interpretation 
EC50 = concentration producing a half-maximal response; N/A = not applicable. 
Note: For combination index: when p < 0.05, combination index is defined as follows: synergy (CI 0-0.7); additivity 
(CI 0.7-1.3); subadditivity (CI 1.3 - 2); antagonism (CI >2). If a conclusion cannot be made using combination 
index (CI), the nonlinear blending value (NLB) is used. When p <0.05, NLB is defined as follows: synergy (NLB > 
20); additivity (NLB between -20 and 20); antagonism (NLB < -20). When p > 0.05 for CI or NLB,  the result is 
scored as inconclusive.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in a multiple myeloma mouse model after oral or 
intravenous administration (Report MLN9708-24699) 
The PK and pharmacodynamic properties of ixazomib were evaluated after PO or IV administration to 
female CB-17 SCID mice bearing MM.1S xenografts. Mice were administered a single IV or PO dose of 
vehicle (5% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin [HP-ß-CD]), a single IV dose of ixazomib at 2.0 mg/kg, 
or a single PO dose of ixazomib at 6.0 mg/kg. Groups of 3 mice were euthanized at 4 hours after the 
vehicle dose, and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 8, or 24 hours after the ixazomib dose.  
Intravenous administration of 2-mg/kg ixazomib and PO administration of 6-mg/kg ixazomib resulted 
in plasma AUC24 1100 and 1680 hr*ng/mL respectively and tumour AUC24 15,800 and 16,100 
hr*ng/mL, respectively. 
Administration of ixazomib by either route resulted in pharmacodynamic effects in MM.1S xenograft 
tumours. A pharmacodynamic effect, as measured by percent proteasome inhibition (I%) of the 20S 
proteasome ß5 site, was observed by 1 hour postdose, and inhibition persisted compared to baseline 
through 24 hours. The mean observed Emax for 20S proteasome inhibition in tumour tissue was 71.7 
I% (at 4 hours) and 60.6 I% (at 8 hours) after IV and PO administration, respectively. The mean area 
under the effect-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUE24) in tumour tissue was 1530 and 1210 
hr*I% after IV and PO administration, respectively. 
Additionally, markers of the UPR that occurs after proteasome inhibition (ATF-3 and GADD34, as 
detected by IHC and Western blot analysis, respectively) were elevated by 4 hours post-dose and 
remained above baseline through 24 hours. By 8 hours post-dose, IV and PO administration both 
resulted in elevated levels of cleaved caspase-3; a marker of apoptosis evaluated by Western blot 
analysis and remained elevated through 24 hours. 
Anti-tumour activity in a multiple myeloma mouse model after oral administration (Report MLN9708-
24176-001A) 
Female CB-17 SCID mice bearing MM.1S xenografts were orally administered vehicle (5% HP-ß-CD) or 
ixazomib at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 mg/kg BIW for 18 days (5 doses) (n = 5/ixazomib group and 8/vehicle 
group). Treatment began on Day 1, when mean tumour volumes (MTVs) reached approximately 100 to 
350 mm3. Tumour growth inhibition (TGI) was determined on Day 19 by calculating the percent TGI 
([MTV of the control group - MTV of a treated group]*100 / [MTV of the control group]). 
Ixazomib administered at 6, 8, and 10 mg/kg resulted in statistically significant anti-tumour activity 
compared to vehicle treatment (TGI = 99.3%, 99.7%, and 100%, respectively; change in the area 
under the tumour volume-time curve (∆AUC), p = 0.001 for all doses). At 6 and 8 mg/kg, tumour 
volume at Day 19 was less than that on Day 0; at 10 mg/kg, there were no measurable tumours on 
Day 19. At 1 and 4 mg/kg, weaker (but still statistically significant) anti-tumour activity was observed 
(TGI = 26.3% and 30.8%, respectively; ∆AUC, p = 0.005 for both doses). However, ixazomib at 2 
mg/kg did not show statistically significant anti-tumour activity (TGI = 9.1%; ∆AUC, p = 0.05). Mice at 
8 mg/kg exhibited a maximum mean body weight loss of 11.2% on Day 11, and 1 mouse at 10-mg/kg 
was removed from study on Day 7 as a result of body weight loss exceeding 15%. 
Anti-tumour activity in a multiple myeloma mouse model after intravenous administration (Report 
MLN9708-24177) 
Female CB-17 SCID mice bearing MM.1S xenografts were IV administered vehicle (5% HP-ß-CD) QW 
(3 doses); ixazomib at 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 7.0 mg/kg BIW for 18 days (6 doses); or ixazomib at 0.82, 
1.64, 4.1, or 11.47 mg/kg QW (3 doses).  Dosing was initiated on Day 0 when MTVs reached 
approximately 100 to 350 mm3. Tumour growth inhibition was determined on Day 19 by calculating

the percent TGI ([MTV of the control group - MTV of a treated group] *100 / [MTV of the control 
group]). 
Ixazomib administered IV BIW at 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 7.0 mg/kg resulted in anti-tumour activity 
compared with vehicle treatment (TGI = 34.2%, 46.8%, 94.2%, and 99.3%, respectively; ∆AUC, p = 
0.001 at all doses except 0.5 mg/kg [p < 0.05]). In both the 2.5- and 7.0-mg/kg groups, strong anti-
tumour activity resulted in tumour volumes that were smaller at the end of the study than at the 
beginning of treatment, and some tumours were no longer visible or measurable in the 7.0-mg/kg 
group. 
Ixazomib administered IV QW at 0.82, 1.64, 4.1, and 11.47 mg/kg also resulted in anti-tumour activity 
compared with vehicle treatment (TGI = 24.7%, 93.2%, 97.1%, and 99.5%, respectively; ∆AUC, p < 
0.001). In the 1.64-, 4.1-, and 11.47-mg/kg groups, strong anti-tumour activity resulted in tumour 
volumes that were smaller at the end of the study than at the beginning of treatment, and some 
tumours were no longer visible or measurable in the 4.1- and 11.47-mg/kg groups. 
The maximum mean body weight change of -11.3% was seen in the 11.47-mg/kg ixazomib IV QW 
group on Day16. No mice were removed from the study as a result of body weight loss. 
Effects on survival, splenomegaly, and igg2a levels in the imyccα/bcl-xl genetically engineered mouse 
model of de novo plasma cell malignancy (Report RPT-01431) 
Male and female iMycCα/Bcl-XL mice were either left untreated or administered ixazomib at 18 mg/kg 
IV BIW or bortezomib at 1.2 mg/kg IV BIW for 6 consecutive weeks (treatment phase) (n = 30). These 
doses represent the MTD for each drug in non-transgenic (B6xFVB/N) F1 hybrid mice. After the 
treatment phase, mice were monitored for an additional 25 weeks. A hazard ratio > 1 indicated an 
advantage of treatment over untreated controls.  
Untreated iMycCα/Bcl-XL mice invariably developed de novo PCM with short onset (median overall 
survival = 112 days) that was accompanied by splenomegaly (mean spleen weight = 0.87 g). 
Ixazomib treatment at 18 mg/kg IV BIW prolonged survival (overall survival = 148 days; hazard ratio 
= 0.116; 95% CI = 0.057 to 0.236; p < 0.0001) and reduced splenomegaly (mean spleen weight = 
0.63 g; p < 0.05) compared to untreated controls. Bortezomib treatment at 1.2 mg/kg IV BIW 
similarly prolonged median overall survival (139 days; hazard ratio = 0.163; 95% CI = 0.085 to 
0.312; p < 0.0001) and alleviated splenomegaly (mean spleen weight = 0.59; p < 0.05). 
Mean plasma IgM levels were also elevated in iMycCα/Bcl-XL mice compared to hybrid (B6x FVB/N) F1, 
age-matched non-transgenic mice (IgM = 1.59 x 106 versus 3.8 x 104 ng/mL in iMycCα/Bcl-XL and 
nontransgenic mice, respectively; p <0.05). IgM levels were as follows in this PCM model : IgM = 
3.97x 105 and 3.03x105 ng/mL with ixazomib and bortezomib, respectively; p >0.05. Levels of IgA, 
IgG1, and IgG2b were not significantly elevated in this transgenic model and were not affected by 
treatment with ixazomib or bortezomib (p > 0.05). 
In all study groups, the mean maximum body weight loss was < 10%. 
Effects on tumour burden and osteolytic lesions in the DP54-Luc disseminated mouse model of 
iMycCα/Bcl-XL plasma cell malignancy (Report RPT-01432) 
DP54 is a mouse plasma cell tumour line derived from the bone marrow of a syngeneic F1 (B6xFVB/N) 
mouse previously inoculated with an iMycCα/Bcl-XL tumour. In vitro, DP54 cells express the iMycCα and 
Bcl-XL transgenes, and various late B-cell and early plasma cell markers including CD38, CD138, and 
B220, and have a gene expression profile very similar to human MM. The DP54 cells were stably 
transfected with firefly luciferase so they could be visualized by bioluminescent imaging of live animals.

DP54-Luc iMycCα/Bcl-XL PCM cells were inoculated IV in the tail vein of female non-obese diabetic 
(NOD)-SCID mice, resulting in disseminated disease. Tumour burden was monitored weekly by 
measuring total photon flux using quantitative bioluminescence Xenogen imaging. When the total 
photon flux reached a baseline level on Day 6, mice were dosed with vehicle (5% HP-ß-CD) IV BIW, 
ixazomib at 11 mg/kg IV BIW, ixazomib at 3 mg/kg SC once daily (QD), or bortezomib at 0.7 mg/kg IV 
BIW (n=10 mice/group [on Day 20, n=9 in the SC ixazomib group; on Day 23, n=9 in the vehicle, 
bortezomib, and SC ixazomib groups and n=5 in the IV ixazomib group]). These doses represent the 
MTD in NOD-SCID mice. A total of 5 doses were administered in the IV dose groups and a total of 15 
doses were administered in the SC dose group. Tumour burden was measured on Days 6, 13, 20, and 
23. Anti-tumour activity was determined by calculating the treatment over control (T/C) ratio of the 
mean photon flux measurement (tumour burden) on Day 20. In addition, cranial suture widening, a 
sign of osteolytic bone disease, was assessed on Day 23 after euthanasia by measuring sagittal suture 
separation area (SSSA) using computed tomography (CT) imaging. 
Anti-tumour activity was shown in all 3 treatment groups compared to the vehicle group: ixazomib at 
11 mg/kg IV BIW (T/C=0.36, p<0.05), ixazomib at 3 mg/kg SC QD (T/C=0.24, p<0.05), and 
bortezomib at 0.7 mg/kg IV BIW (T/C=0.52, p<0.05). 
Ixazomib treatment at 11 mg/kg IV BIW also reduced cranial suture widening by 27% (SSSA=0.85 
±0.16 mm2) compared to vehicle treatment (SSSA =1.16 ± 0.04 mm2) (p< 0.05). In contrast, 
bortezomib at 0.7 mg/kg IV BIW had no significant effect on SSSA (1.17 ±0.08 mm2) compared to 
vehicle treatment (p >0.05). SSSA for ixazomib SC QD was not determined in this study. No treatment 
group dosed with ixazomib or bortezomib exhibited a mean maximum body weight loss of >5%. 
Anti-tumour activity in a DP54-Luc intratibial mouse model of a plasma cell malignancy derived from a 
genetically engineered mouse model (Report RPT-01433) 
Female nude mice were inoculated with DP54-Luc iMycCα/Bcl-XL PCM cells into the bone marrow space 
of the tibia. Mice were treated IV BIW with 5% HP-ß-CD, ixazomib at 13 mg/kg, or bortezomib at 0.8 
mg/kg for 3 consecutive weeks. These doses represent the MTDs in female nude mice. Treatment 
began on Day 10. Anti-tumour activity was determined by calculating the T/C ratio of the mean photon 
flux measurement (tumour burden) on Day 29. Ixazomib treatment at 13 mg/kg IV BIW showed 
significant anti-tumour activity (T/C= 0.05, p< 0.05) compared to vehicle treatment. Bortezomib 
treatment at 0.8 mg/kg IV BIW showed similar anti-tumour activity (T/C= 0.02, p< 0.05). No 
treatment group exhibited a mean maximum body weight loss of >5%. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects).  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In vitro, ixazomib (0.00508 to 100 µM) weakly inhibited the cloned cardiac potassium (K+) hERG 
channel in HEK-293 cells with a Ki of 24.9 µM and an IC50 of 59.6 µM. The ixazomib concentration (Ki 
of 24.9 µM) associated with in vitro hERG activity is >190-fold the human Cmax of approximately 0.13 
µM at the clinical phase 3 dose of 4 mg administered QW for 3 weeks on a 28-day cycle (the multiple is 
significantly greater when accounting for human plasma protein binding). 
A telemetry in vivo study was performed in beagle dogs to evaluate the effects of ixazomib on the 
CVS. ECG, nervous system, and respiratory evaluations were also conducted as part of GLP-compliant 
repeated-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs. No treatment-related effects on blood pressure, 
heart rate, or ECG parameters (including PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and corrected QT

[QTc] interval) were observed at any time point at any dose. In conclusion, ixazomib had no effects on 
the CVS in conscious dogs at single doses up to the highest dose administered, 0.21-mg/kg ixazomib. 
Safety Pharmacology Assessments in Repeated-Dose Toxicology Studies 
In GLP-compliant repeated-dose toxicology studies, ixazomib had no overt effects on the respiratory 
systems of rats or dogs. In dogs, PO doses ≥ 0.10 mg/kg (BIW for 2 weeks, followed by a 10-day non-
dosing period; 21-day cycle) resulted in microscopic neuronal findings including degeneration of the 
sympathetic, dorsal root, peripheral autonomic, and end organ ganglia, and secondary axonal/nerve 
fibre degeneration of the peripheral nerves and ascending tracts in the dorsal columns of the spinal 
cord. Occasionally, microscopic findings correlated with clinical signs of ataxia, wide-based stance, and 
decreased reflexes. In the 9-month dog study (10 cycles) where the dosing regimen mimics the clinical 
regimen (28-day cycle), similar microscopic neuronal findings were observed at 0.20 mg/kg (AUC24 
1870 hr*ng/mL). There were no changes in neuronal function detected in the neurobehavioral 
functional assessment. The majority of neuronal findings were reversed or reversing after a recovery 
period, with the exception of findings in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord.  
There were no effects on ECG parameters in the 1-, 5-, or 10-cycle PO, and 2- or 5-cycle IV studies in 
dogs. Potential increases in QTc were observed in male dogs in the 1-cycle PO study at 0.1 mg/kg 
(Day 11 AUC24=159 ng/mL); however, increased QTc was not observed in female dogs in this study 
nor in any dogs in the 2-cycle IV study that had Cmax exposures that were similar or greater than 
those of the male dogs with potential increases in the 1-cycle PO study.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of ixazomib was evaluated after PO and IV administration of ixazomib citrate or ixazomib to 
Sprague-Dawley rats, New Zealand white rabbits, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys.  PK was also 
evaluated in tumour-bearing mouse models. 
Sensitive and selective LC/MS/MS methods were developed and validated in rat, rabbit, and dog 
plasma. These methods were used to determine the plasma concentrations of ixazomib in rats, rabbits, 
and dogs for the GLP-compliant TK studies with a LLOQ of 2.00ng/mL. Concentrations of ixazomib in 
mouse, rat, and dog whole blood and plasma samples in non-GLP-compliant PK and TK studies were 
determined using a non-validated LC/MS/MS method, with an LLOQ of 2.00 ng/mL. 
Absorption  
Caco-2 permeability and efflux transporter interactions of ixazomib 
In a non-GLP-compliant study in the Caco-2 cell model, ixazomib showed moderate permeability and 
appeared to be a low-affinity substrate for efflux pumps. The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) 
of ixazomib in Caco-2 cells at pH 7.4 was 2.0 x10-6 and 5.8x 10-6 cm/sec in the apical-to-basolateral 
(A-to-B) and basolateral-to-apical (B-to-A) directions, respectively, at 5 µM, and 2.2 x 10-6 and 6.8 x 
10-6 cm/sec in the A-to-B and B-to-A directions, respectively, at 50 µM.  
When ixazomib (5 µM) or ixazomib citrate (10 µM) was incubated with known efflux pump inhibitors, 
GF120918 (an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP), LY335979 (an inhibitor of P-gp), Ko143 (an inhibitor of 
BCRP), and indomethacin (an inhibitor of MRP2), the efflux ratio of ixazomib was reduced more than 2 
fold with GF120918 or LY335979, but less than 2 fold with Ko143 or indomethacin.

Absorption of ixazomib after a single oral dose 
In fasted rats (n=6), oral bioavailability was 41% and 34% in plasma and blood, respectively, after a 
single PO dose of 0.8-mg/kg ixazomib in 10% HP-ß-CD. The fraction of ixazomib absorbed (Fa) was 
approximately 60%, as determined by comparing the dose-normalized blood AUC24 after PO 
administration and intraportal vein (IPV) infusion. 
In fasted rabbits (n =3/group), oral bioavailability was 18.8% and 20.0% in plasma and blood, 
respectively, after a single PO dose of 0.2-mg/kg ixazomib citrate reconstituted in Water for Injection 
(WFI) and formulated in55-mM citrate buffer and 3% glycine, pH 5.8. 
In 2 separate studies in fasted dogs, ixazomib had oral bioavailability of 72.2% in plasma [n =3/sex] 
and 105% in blood [n =3 males]) after a single PO dose in a citrate buffer solution, indicating complete 
absorption. With a clinical prototype capsule formulation of ixazomib citrate, the oral bioavailability of 
ixazomib was approximately 130% on the basis of the plasma AUC24 ratio (capsule-to-IV, using the IV 
data from Report RPT-01151). After a single PO administration of either ixazomib in citrate buffer or 
ixazomib citrate capsule, the PK profiles at the post-absorption phase were overall similar to those 
after a single IV administration of ixazomib in citrate buffer. 
Absorption after PO administration was rapid in plasma in both rats and dogs, with a tmax in the range 
of 0.42 to 1.0 hours, and slow in rabbits (tmax =24 hours). 
Distribution 
The concentrations of ixazomib derived radioactivity in tissues and its affinity for various tissues were 
determined after single PO or IV administration of [14C]ixazomib or [14C]ixazomib citrate to rats. The 
highest concentrations of 14C among all tissues were observed at 0.5 hours post-dose in 21 tissues. In 
blood, the highest concentration of drug-derived radioactivity was 0.439 µg equiv/g, observed at 0.5 
hours post-dose; in plasma, the highest concentration of total drug-derived radioactivity was 0.250 µg 
equiv/g, also observed at 0.5 hours. The tissues with the lowest relative concentrations (≤ 0.03 µg 
equiv/g) at tmax were the brain, spinal cord, testis, bone, and eye lens. For most tissues, elimination 
was nearly complete by 672 hours post-dose, with trace amounts of radioactivity still observed in most 
tissues; concentrations in the brain (all regions), DRG, white adipose, bone, esophagus, and eye lens 
were all below the quantitation limit (BQL). Drug-derived radioactivity was found in melanin-containing 
tissues (eg, pigmented skin and the uveal tract of the eye), but the concentrations decreased in a 
manner similar to that seen with other tissues during the study and a specific association of 
radioactivity to melanin was not obvious. 
In a QWBA study in albino rats, [14C]ixazomib (mean dose of 0.30 mg/kg [free acid] [approximately 
42.3 µCi/kg], formulated in a solution of 10% HP-ß-CD and water) was administered once IV to 6 male 
Sprague-Dawley rats. Drug-derived radioactivity was widely distributed to tissues and retained in most 
tissues to the last sampling time point. The highest concentrations of 14C among all tissues were 
observed at 10 minutes post-dose in 14 tissues or 1 hour post-dose in 12 tissues. Tissues with 14C 
concentrations > 1.0 µg equiv/g at tmax were the cecum and cecum contents (1.070 and 3.585 µg 
equiv/g, respectively, at 8 hours post-dose), large intestine contents (5.141 µg equiv/g at 8 hours 
post-dose), small intestine and small intestine contents (1.162 and 7.285 µg equiv/g, respectively, at 
3 hours post-dose), adrenal gland (2.424 µg equiv/g at 3 hours post-dose), urinary bladder contents 
(4.761 µg equiv/g at 1 hour post-dose), liver (1.453 µg equiv/g at 1 hour post-dose]), renal cortex 
(1.266 µg equiv/g at 10 minutes post-dose), and renal medulla (1.038 µg equiv/g at 1 hour post-
dose). In blood, the highest concentration of drug-derived radioactivity was 0.404 µg equiv/g, 
observed at 10 minutes post-dose. The tissues with the lowest relative concentrations (≤ 0.04 µg 
equiv/g) at tmax were those of the CNS: the brain (cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla), dorsal root

nerve, sciatic nerve, and spinal cord. For most tissues, elimination was not complete by 72 hours post-
dose. 
In a QWBA study in albino rats, [14C]ixazomib citrate (mean dose of 0.32 mg/kg [free acid] 
[approximately 45.0 µCi/kg], formulated in a solution of 0.9% saline) was administered once IV to 6 
male Sprague-Dawley rats. Drug-derived radioactivity was widely distributed in the DRG and blood and 
retained to the last sampling time point. Tissue concentrations were similar between QWBA and LSC 
analysis, and between the DRG and blood at each time point. The highest concentration of drug-related 
radioactivity in the DRG and blood was observed at 1 hour post-dose (0.244 and 0.270 µg equiv/g, 
respectively). The concentration-versus-time profile in the DRG was similar to that in blood; all drug-
related material in blood was ixazomib, as evidenced by the ratio of ixazomib concentration to total 
radioactivity, as analyzed by LC/MS/MS and LSC, respectively (ranged from 1.0 to 1.2 through 312 
hours post-dose). 
The PK of ixazomib after IV administration of ixazomib was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats, New 
Zealand white rabbits, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys using non-compartmental analysis.  
After a single IV dose in PK/pharmacodynamic studies, ixazomib demonstrated a low blood and plasma 
clearance and a moderate blood Vss (1.05 to 2.78 L/kg) in all nonclinical species evaluated. The 
concentration-versus time curve of ixazomib displayed a distinct biexponential profile, with a steep 
initial distribution phase and a long apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) > 24 hours in all 
species tested. Ixazomib had a higher clearance and a larger Vss in plasma than in blood, largely 
because of the RBC partitioning; however, plasma clearance was low in all nonclinical species tested. 
In vitro studies with ixazomib showed that ixazomib is moderately to highly bound to plasma protein in 
mouse (88-92%), rat (93-95%), dog (92-96%), monkey (92-95%), and human (88-89%) plasma. No 
concentration- or species-dependent trends were observed. An additional study with [14C]ixazomib 
citrate (0.05-10 µM) shiwed that ixazomib is highly bound to plasma protein in mouse (85%), rat 
(89%), dog (83%), and human (94%) plasma.  No concentration-dependent trends were observed. 
Evaluation of the human in vitro plasma protein binding conducted with pre-dose plasma samples from 
patients with advanced solid tumours or MM showed a mean value of approximately 99% bound. 
In vitro studies with ixazomib at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 µg/mL showed RBC partitioning in a 
concentration-dependent and saturable manner in mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. An 
additional in vitro RBC partitioning study using [14C]ixazomib citrate also showed that the distribution 
ratio of ixazomib-related substances into blood cells was moderate to high in mice, rats, dogs, and 
humans. As showen in a subsequent study, RBC partitioning of ixazomib was not affected by pre-
treatment of blood samples with carfilzomib, a marketed selective proteasome inhibitor. 
An in vitro study of transport of [14C]ixazomib citrate in human hepatocytes in the absence or 
presence of rifampin (200 µM) (a known OATP inhibitor) or cyclosporin A (10 μmol/L) (a known 
inhibitor of OATPs and sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide [NTCP]), indicated that 
ixazomib is not a substrate of OATPs and NTCP. 
Metabolism 
Seven major metabolites of ixazomib (50 µM) were identified in hepatic microsomes (1 mg/mL) 
derived from male CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans 
(pooled, male and female); no metabolite unique to humans was identified in vitro (Figure 2).

An additional in vitro metabolism study of [14C]ixazomib citrate using liver microsomes from male 
mice, male and female rats, male dogs, male monkeys, and humans (both males and females) also 
identified 7 metabolites of ixazomib  (Report MLN9708-29687). Results showed that ixazomib was 
metabolized to M12, M3, M20, M1, M2, dehydrogenated ixazomib, UK-1, and others in the presence of 
a NADPH-generating system. M1 was the major metabolite in all species. There were no metabolites 
specific for HLMs.

The in vitro metabolism of [14C]ixazomib citrate (10 µg [rats and humans] and 100 µM [rats only]) 
was further evaluated in rat and human liver microsomes (1 mg/mL) and in cryopreserved rat and 
human hepatocytes (1 million viable cells/mL) (Report MIL-R1880R3). Liquid chromatography/ 
radiochromatograms of the metabolite profiles of [14C]ixazomib citrate in rat and human liver 
microsomes showed that [14C]ixazomib citrate was converted almost instantaneously to ixazomib.  
In human liver microsomal extracts, M1 was the major metabolite, followed by M3, while M2, M8, M12, 
M15, M19, and M20 were observed at lower levels; human hepatocyte incubations again showed M1 
and M3 as the dominant metabolites, with M8 in small quantities. Although M1 and M3 were the 
predominant metabolites in both microsomes and hepatocytes from rats and humans, neither of these 
metabolites was observed in human plasma samples.

Human Liver Microsomes and Hepatocytes 
The structures of metabolites M13 through M19 are tentative and are not shown in this figure. 
The metabolism of [14C]ixazomib citrate was evaluated after a single PO dose of 0.8 mg/kg 
[14C]ixazomib citrate to intact and BDC male Sprague-Dawley rats (Report MIL-R1800R2). Metabolite 
profiles of [14C]ixazomib citrate in plasma, urine, bile, and faeces were determined by HPLC with 
radioactivity detection and by LC/UV/MS. Radiochromatograms from analysis of pooled plasma, bile, 
and urine samples indicated that [14C]ixazomib citrate underwent moderate to extensive metabolism 
in rats; [14C]ixazomib citrate was immediately hydrolyzed to ixazomib and was not detected in any 
sample.  
In plasma, ixazomib was found to be a major radioactive peak at all time points, representing 47.3% 
of the total radioactivity in plasma. M10 (23.5%) was the most predominant metabolite. Other 
metabolites observed were M1 (2.7%), M8 (5.7%), M9 (2.0%), M12 (5.3%), M13 (hydroxylated M1) 
(2.4%), and M14 (structure unknown) (11.2%).

In urine, of the 18.2% of the total dose excreted over 48 hours, ixazomib was a minor component 
compared to its metabolites, comprising less than 1% of the total dose administered. Metabolites M1, 
M8, M10, M12, M13, and M20 comprised 1.5%, 3.9%, 0.7%, 4.2%, 3.5%, and 3.0% of the total dose 
excreted in urine, respectively; interestingly, M20 was not observed in the urine collected from 0 to 6 
hours, even though it was found to be a major component in later samples. In bile, M8 and M11 were 
the major drug-related components through 48 hours post-dose, comprising less than 4% and 3% of 
the total dose administered, respectively. 
In faeces through 48 hours post-dose, ixazomib comprised 26.8% of the total dose administered, while 
metabolites M12 and M20 comprised 4.6% and 12.7% of the total dose administered, respectively. 
Metabolite profiles were evaluated after single PO administration of [14C]ixazomib citrate at a dose of 
0.2148 mg/kg (0.15 mg/kg as ixazomib) to male dogs. In plasma, ixazomib represented 58.2% of the 
total radioactivity. Additional metabolites comprised the remainder (41.8%) of the total radioactivity. 
In the urine and faeces during 0 to 120 hours, ixazomib comprised 3.1% of the urinary radioactivity 
and unidentified metabolites comprised the remaining 96.9% of the urinary radioactivity. Ixazomib 
comprised 23.9% of the faecal radioactivity and unidentified metabolites comprised the remaining 
76.1% of the faecal radioactivity. 
The metabolism of ixazomib citrate in humans was evaluated after PO administration of 2-mg/m2 
ixazomib (dosed as ixazomib citrate) to 3 subjects on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 during a 21-day treatment 
cycle in Study C16003. Plasma samples, obtained after dosing on Days 1 and 11 and pooled, were 
used for preliminary metabolite identification and were analyzed by LC/MS/MS. 
Ixazomib citrate rapidly converted to ixazomib, and unchanged ixazomib was the major drug-related 
component observed in Day 1 and Day 11 human plasma. Using mass spectral multiple-reaction 
monitoring (MRM) for potential metabolites that had been identified in rats and in vitro in human 
hepatocytes or liver microsomes only 1 metabolite, M8, was present in appreciable (about 10% of 
parent, by comparison of AUC8) levels in human plasma. Other metabolites previously identified in rat 
plasma or HLMs or human hepatocytes were not detected in human plasma. 
All metabolites found in HLM studies were also found in rat and dog liver microsomal studies, 
supporting the use of rats and dogs as appropriate species for toxicology studies. 
In a non-GLP-compliant study to evaluate the stability of ixazomib and ixazomib citrate (2 µM) in 
Sprague-Dawley rat and human serum and deproteinated serum, ixazomib or ixazomib citrate were 
spiked separately into rat and human serum and deproteinated serum.The results indicated that 
ixazomib citrate had converted to ixazomib in all test matrices, and that ixazomib was stable in rat and 
human serum and unstable in deproteinated rat and human serum. Changes in pH did not affect 
stability of ixazomib, and were likely not the reason for the instability in deproteinated rat and human 
serum. 
Incubations with a panel of human complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA)-expressed 
recombinant CYP supersomes (about 100 pmol/mL) showed that all 5 major CYP isozymes (CYP1A2, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4), as well as cytochrome b5 and oxidoreductase, extensively metabolized 
ixazomib to M1 and, to a lesser extent, M2 and M3 (Report RPT-01136). The other oxidative 
metabolites, M4, M5, M6, and M7, were also detected with all CYP isozymes tested, except CYP1A2.  
Ixazomib (50 µM) was metabolized by all of CYP-expressing microsomes; M1 was the main metabolite 
formed by all of CYP-expressing microsomes and other metabolites were also formed in minor extent. 
M12 and UK-1 were mainly formed by CYP2C19 and M2 was mainly formed by CYP3A4. M3, M20, and 
dehydrogenated ixazomib were formed by all of the CYP-expressing microsomes.

EMA/654545/2016  
Page 31/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To determine the relative contributions of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 to the microsomal 
metabolism of ixazomib, selective CYP isozyme inhibitors were incubated with HLMs (0.5 mg/mL) and 
[14C]ixazomib (10 µM) at 370C. Metabolite amounts quantified with the online radiometric detector 
showed that CYP3A4 (34%) was the major CYP isozyme that contributed to the metabolism of 
ixazomib, followed by CYP1A2 (30.7%), 2D6(14.7%) , and 2C9(12.1%); the relative contribution of 
CYP2C19 was negligible. 
The contribution of 7 CYP isozymes, including CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, to ixazomib metabolism was 
further evaluated using human cDNA CYP-expressing recombinant microsomes (Supersomes) (rCYPs)). 
At the 10-μM substrate concentration, CYP3A4 was the major CYP isozyme contributing to the 
metabolism of ixazomib, followed by CYP1A2 and then CYP2B6. The relative contributions of the 7 
major CYP isozymes were: 3A4 (42.3%), 1A2 (26.1%), 2B6 (16.0%), 2C8 (6.0%), 2D6 (4.8%), 2C19 
(4.8%) and 2C9 (1%). These data are similar to the results using chemical inhibitors of five CYP 
isozymes in HLMs at a 10-μM substrate concentration in a previous study. 
Examination of the rate of formation of the measurable metabolites and the rate of disappearance 
of ixazomib at 0.1 and 0.5 μM showed that there is little difference between the rates of metabolism of 
ixazomib in control incubations and in rCYP isozyme incubations.  
Induction of CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4/5 activity by ixazomib citrate was examined in vitro in a non-GLP-
compliant study by evaluating isozyme activity. Incubation with up to 5000-ng/mL (9.67 µM) ixazomib 
citrate resulted in 60%, 67%, and 73% decreases in CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4/5 activity, respectively, 
with corresponding decreases in CYP isozyme immune-reactive protein levels. The cause of these 
decreases in CYP isozyme activity and protein levels are unknown, but may be a result of cytotoxicity 
corresponding to prolonged exposure to ixazomib citrate in cultured human hepatocytes, as evidenced 
by an apparent concentration-dependent increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release resulting 
from deteriorating cell membrane integrity. 
Ixazomib was evaluated as a reversible inhibitor of CYP isozyme activity in a study where HLMs 
(0.25mg/mL) from a pool of 200 individuals were incubated with marker substrates at concentrations 
approximately equal to their apparent Km. Incubation was performed in the presence or absence of 
ixazomib and known CYP inhibitors at various concentrations through a direct inhibition assay. There 
was little or no direct inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5 by ixazomib in HLMs. 
The IC50s for these isozymes were reported as > 30 µM, the highest concentration of ixazomib 
examined. Assuming the potential inhibition by ixazomib of CYP isozymes would be competitive in 
nature, the Ki was assumed to be greater than 15 µM. Similar results were also observed in additional 
in vitro studies. 
Excretion 
After PO administration of [14C]ixazomib citrate to rats, the majority of the total radioactivity (the 
parent and its metabolites) was recovered in faeces. Similarly, in BDC rats, a substantial excretion of 
radioactivity was recovered in faeces after PO dosing, suggesting the possibility of unabsorbed 
compound or active intestinal secretion; urinary and biliary excretion of radioactivity accounted equally 
(22% to 23% of dose in 72 hours). After PO administration of [14C]ixazomib citrate to dogs, ixazomib 
citrate-related substances were excreted into the urine and faeces in comparable levels. In a separate 
study with unlabeled ixazomib, urinary excretion of the unchanged drug was negligible (< 5% of dose) 
after IV dosing.  
After a single IV dose of [14C]ixazomib to Sprague-Dawley rats in a QWBA study the highest 
concentrations were primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract tissues and contents, urinary

bladder contents, renal cortex and medulla, and liver.  After IV administration of ixazomib to Sprague-
Dawley rats (0.3 mg/kg; n =4), beagle dogs (0.2 mg/kg; n = 3), and cynomolgus monkeys (0.1 
mg/kg; n = 3), only a trace amount (< 5% of the dose) of ixazomib was excreted in urine.

Single-Dose Toxicology Study of Ixazomib Citrate in Mice (Report MLN9708-24954) 
Eleven male CD-1 mice/group were dosed with ixazomib citrate via a single oral gavage administration 
at 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg (doses in terms of ixazomib), dissolved in water for injection. TK analysis was 
conducted at 24 hours post-dose. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluations were not performed.All 
animals at 8-mg/kg showed adverse clinical signs at 6 hours post-dose, necessitating euthanasia 
(decrease in locomotor activity, hypothermia, and moribundity). No treatment-related effects were 
noted at 2 and 4 mg/kg. Between 2 and 4 mg/kg, Cmax and AUC from the time 0 to 24 hours (AUC24) 
increased in a dose-dependent. In conclusion, 4 mg/kg (mean plasma AUC24 = 926 hr*ng/mL) of 
ixazomib was the MTD under the conditions of this study; a single dose of 8 mg/kg resulted in 
moribundity and adverse clinical signs requiring euthanasia.  
Single-Dose Oral Toxicology Study of Ixazomib in Rats (Report RPT-01104) 
Three male Sprague Dawley rats per group were dosed via oral gavage with ixazomib at 0.1, 0.3, or 1 
mg/kg, formulated in 10% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. All animals were euthanized on Day 8, 
and a complete macroscopic evaluation was performed. Toxicokinetic analysis was not performed in 
this study. All rats survived to scheduled euthanasia. Test article-related effects were limited to the 
1mg/kg group, and included decreased activity (Days 1 to 3), decreased body weight gain (Days 1 to 
4), decreased defecation (Days 2 to 4), soft stool (Days 1 and 2), and body surface staining (Days 1 to 
3). No findings were reported during macroscopic evaluation. On the basis of these findings, the MTD 
of ixazomib in Sprague-Dawley rats after a single oral gavage administration was 1 mg/kg.

Two male Beagle dogs per group received 0.021, 0.07, 0.14, and 0.21 mg/kg ixazomib citrate (doses 
in terms of ixazomib) via oral gavage, formulated in 0.5% weight-to-volume ratio methylcellulose; the 
same animals dosed at 0.021 mg/kg were dosed at 0.14 mg/kg after a 7-day washout period. 
Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were not performed. All animals survived to scheduled 
euthanasia. Both Cmax and AUC24 increased in a dose-dependent manner. After dosing at 0.14 
mg/kg, time to reach Cmax (tmax) was slightly delayed because there were bimodal peaks of plasma 
concentrations; the cause of this could not be determined.  No test article-related effects on body 
weight, food consumption, or ECGs were observed at any dose level. Possible test article-related 
effects were limited to loose stool and/or diarrhoea observed at 0.21 mg/kg, but these effects were not 
considered adverse because of the sporadic nature and lack of correlative findings. On the basis of only 
minor clinical findings, the MTD under the conditions of this study was considered to be 0.21 mg/kg 
(mean plasma AUC24 = 2140 hr*ng/mL).

  One-Month (2-Cycle) Intermittent-Dose Oral Toxicology Study of Ixazomib (Report KLA00354) 
A GLP-compliant intermittent-dose study in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats was conducted to 
evaluate the potential toxicity and TK of ixazomib when administered by oral gavage for 2 cycles over 
32 days. Each cycle consisted of BIW dosing for 2 weeks separated by a 10-day non-dosing period. 
Cycle 2 was followed by a 14-day recovery period. Rats received either vehicle (55-mM citrate and 1% 
propylene glycol, pH 5.2) or ixazomib at 0.4, 0.8, or 1.2 mg/kg. A single dose of 1.2 mg/kg was not 
tolerated; surviving males were not dosed further during Cycle 1 and the dose was lowered to 1.0 
mg/kg during Cycle 2. High-dose females received a single dose of 1.0 mg/kg during Cycle 1; 
however, as a result of the lack of tolerability, remaining high-dose females were not dosed for the 
remainder of the study. 
Each group was assigned 15 animals per sex (10 main study and 5 recovery), with an additional 3 
rats/sex in the vehicle control group and 9 rats/sex/group in the ixazomib groups for TK analysis. After 
the 2 cycles of dose administration, up to 10 main study rats/sex/group were euthanized on Day 33, 
and the remaining recovery rats (up to 5/sex/group) were euthanized on Day 47 after a 14-day 
recovery period. All surviving high-dose females were euthanized on Day 33 because dosing was 
discontinued after Day 1.  
Plasma exposure to ixazomib, as measured by Cmax and AUC24, increased in an approximately dose-
proportional manner at all doses and was generally similar between males and females. There was also 
no accumulation over the course of the study.  
There were a total of 20 deaths (died or were euthanized in moribund condition) over the course of the 
study. Several of the deaths occurred after TK blood collection, including in 2 control rats. These 
deaths were presumably related to blood collection procedures, but the deaths in the ixazomib-treated 
animals may have been related to test article administration. Of those animals euthanized in moribund 
condition, the cause was attributed to metabolic stress, likely precipitated by intestinal mucosal toxicity 
(acute inflammation, oedema, mucosal thickening, and lamina propria cellular depletion) and 
associated fluid and electrolyte imbalances. In addition, minimal to moderate bone marrow cellular 
depletion, minimal to moderate cortical cellular necrosis of the thymus and adrenal gland, mild to 
moderate vacuolation of the adrenal gland, mild cellular depletion of the thymus, and minimal to 
moderate lymphoid depletion of the spleen, Peyer’s patches, and/or mandibular and mesenteric lymph 
nodes were also observed. Clinical signs before death were also consistent with a GI disturbance 
(mucoid and soft faeces) and stress (hunched posture, urine and porphyrin staining). Minimal to 
moderate hepatocellular vacuolation was observed in many of these animals; minimal to mild necrosis 
of the liver in a few of these animals was considered secondary to moribundity and not a primary test

At all doses (0.4, 0.8, and 1.2/1.0 mg/kg), there were GI tract and adrenal adverse findings that were 
generally dose dependent in incidence or severity. Gastrointestinal changes included minimal to mild 
intestine mucosal thickening and/or minimal to mild acute inflammation. Macroscopically, distended 
stomach was also observed at all doses, but this is a common toxicity finding and is not necessarily 
specific for GI toxicity. Clinical pathology changes that may have been related to GI effects included 
decreased ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and cholesterol (not all of 
these parameters were decreased at all doses and/or in both sexes). In addition, there were increases 
in WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, and fibrogen that were consistent with an inflammatory response 
(potentially related to GI tract findings), as well as increases in basophils and decreases in eosinophils. 
Decreased body weights and food consumption at 0.8 and 1.2/1.0 mg/kg, and soft faeces, porphyrin 
staining, urine staining, and rough hair coat observed at 1.2/1.0 mg/kg were also likely reflective of GI 
tract toxicity. Minimal to mild adrenal gland cortical vacuolation was also observed at all doses and 
correlated with increased relative adrenal gland weights in males at 0.8 and 1.2/1.0 mg/kg. Increased 
liver weights (absolute and relative to body) were also noted at all doses, but without a microscopic 
correlate. 
At 0.8 and 1.2/1.0 mg/kg, there were lymphoid system and bone marrow effects that included minimal 
to moderate mesenteric and mandibular lymph node lymphoid depletion, minimal to marked thymic 
cortical cellular depletion, minimal to mild lymphoid depletion of the Peyer’s patch, and, in bone 
marrow smears, increased total myeloid cell counts and myeloid:erythroid ratio (M:E) and decreased 
lymphocyte count compared to controls. Macroscopic correlates included small thymus and decreased 
thymic weights (absolute and relative to body). 
 
Three-Month (5-Cycle) Intermittent-Dose Oral Toxicology Study of Ixazomib Citrate (Report 
WIL-41610) 
The potential systemic toxicity and TK of ixazomib was evaluated when administered as ixazomib 
citrate by oral gavage to male and female Sprague Dawley rats for 5 cycles over 94 days. Each cycle 
consisted of BIW dosing for 2 weeks separated by a 10-day non-dosing period. Cycle 5 was followed by 
a 14-day recovery period. Rats received either vehicle or ixazomib citrate at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/kg 
(doses in terms of ixazomib) in Cycles 1 and 2; before initiation of Cycle 3, the 0.8 mg/kg dose was 
reduced to 0.6 mg/kg. Each group was assigned 15 animals per sex (10 main study and 5 recovery 
[with the exception of the 0.2-mg/kg dose group, which had 10/sex]), with an additional 6 rats/sex in 
the vehicle control group and 18 rats/sex/group in the test article-dosed groups for TK analysis. After 
the 5 cycles of dose administration, up to 10 main study rats/sex/group were euthanized on Day 95, 
and the remaining recovery rats (up to 5/sex/group) were euthanized on Day 109 after a 14-day 
recovery period. 
After administration of 2 cycles of 0.8-mg/kg, 1 male and 1 female were euthanized in moribund 
condition on Days 29 and 31, respectively, as a result of clinical signs that included hypoactivity, 
dermal atonia, thin appearance, pale extremities, extremities and/or body cool to the touch, labored 
respiration, decreased defecation, and smaller than normal faeces. Microscopic findings contributing to 
the condition of these animals included minimal to moderate GI epithelial degeneration, minimal to 
mild intestinal epithelial single-cell necrosis, minimal to mild intestinal acute inflammation, mild bone 
marrow hypocellularity/single-cell necrosis, and/or mild to moderate lymphoid depletion that 
predisposed these rats to possible sepsis. Three additional animals were found dead; 2 of the 3 deaths 
were vehicle control animals (1 male and 1 female each) and hence were unrelated to test article 
administration (related to gavage or blood collection procedural injury). The third animal, a female at 
0.8/0.6 mg/kg, was found dead shortly after clinical pathology blood collection on Day 95. This animal 
had been dosed for a full 5 cycles and showed microscopic findings of mild to moderate epithelial

hyperplasia in the small intestines and moderate lymphoid depletion and minimal single-cell necrosis in 
the mesenteric and/or popliteal lymph nodes. This death was considered related to blood collection 
procedures but could not be definitively determined as unrelated to test article administration. 
In animals surviving to the end of the study, there were no test article-related clinical observations, 
ophthalmic or macroscopic findings, or alterations in coagulation parameters at any dose level. 
At all dose levels, test article-related microscopic findings at the main study necropsy were observed in 
the GI tract and lymph nodes. Findings in the GI tract included minimal to mild epithelial hyperplasia, 
minimal acute inflammation and single-cell necrosis in the small intestine at all doses, and at 0.8/0.6 
mg/kg, minimal epithelial hyperplasia and acute inflammation of the rectum. Haematology changes 
that generally correlated with GI tract inflammation included increased circulating leukocyte, 
neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and/or basophil counts at ≥ 0.2 mg/kg. Decreased food 
consumption at ≥ 0.4 mg/kg and decreased weight gain in males at 08/0.6 mg/kg were also likely 
related to the GI tract injury, and may have contributed to decreased cholesterol and K. Minimal to 
moderate lymphoid depletion of the mandibular and mesenteric lymph node and/or Peyer’s patches, 
and minimal to mild single-cell necrosis in the lymph nodes were also observed at all doses. Decreased 
eosinophil and platelet counts at ≥0.4 mg/kg were likely related to lymphoid depletion. In general, all 
findings were reversed or reversing by the end of the 14-day recovery period. 
  Six-Month (7-Cycle) Intermittent Dose Oral Toxicology Study of Ixazomib Citrate (Report WIL-
416165) 
A GLP-compliant intermittent-dose study in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats was conducted to 
evaluate the potential systemic toxicity and TK of ixazomib, when administered as ixazomib citrate, by 
oral gavage for 6 months (7 dosing cycles). Each cycle consisted of 3 QW doses separated by a 13-day 
non-dosing period (28-day cycle). Cycle 7 was followed by a 14-day recovery period. Rats received 
either vehicle (55-mM citrate buffer and 0.45% NaCl in SWI, USP, pH 5.8) or ixazomib citrate at 0.2, 
0.4, and 0.8 mg/kg (doses in terms of ixazomib). Each group was assigned 15 rats/sex (10 main study 
and 5 recovery). Starting with Cycle 3 (Day 56), the dose level for the high-dose females was lowered 
from 0.8 to 0.6 mg/kg as a result of the overt toxicity and mortality (referred to hereafter as the 
0.8/0.6-mg/kg group). 
A total of 7 high-dose female deaths occurred. Two high-dose (0.8 mg/kg) females died after the first 
dose (Days 1 and 2); these animals were subsequently replaced because their mortality was 
considered not clearly test article related at that time. Four females (0.8 mg/kg) died between Days 9 
and 36, and a fifth female (0.8/0.6 mg/kg) was found dead on Day 170. All 7 animals were found dead 
within 2 days of dose administration. Clinical observations in these early death animals included red 
material around nose, yellow material around the urogenital area, and clear discharge from both eyes. 
The mortality observed in females may have been related to greater Cmax in high-dose females 
relative to that in males, or the age of the rats at the start of the study (7 weeks old), which was 
younger than in previous rat studies. For animals where a cause of death could be determined, the 
early death was attributed to a combination of test article-related intestinal, liver, and/or lymphoid 
toxicity. Test article-related microscopic observations in the intestines included minimal to mild 
neutrophilic infiltrates in the lamina propria, minimal to mild epithelial hyperplasia and necrosis, and 
mild villous atrophy. Test article-related changes in the liver included mild to moderate hepatocellular 
degeneration/necrosis, moderate generalized hepatocellular vacuolation, and minimal neutrophil 
infiltration in the sinusoids. Minimal to moderate lymphoid depletion and/or necrosis was observed in 
the lymphoid tissues, and minimal to mild hypocellularity and/or minimal single cell necrosis was 
observed in the bone marrow.

Page 38/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was also a loss of medullary plasmacytosis in the submandibular lymph nodes of the early 
mortality females. Additional test article-related microscopic findings in the early mortality females 
were mild haemorrhage and minimal to mild degeneration/necrosis of the adrenal zona fasciculata; 
minimal to mild depletion of cytoplasmic secretory granules and single-cell necrosis of the cells of the 
adrenal medulla; and mild ulceration and minimal degeneration/necrosis of muscle of the tongue. 
At all doses, there were generally dose-dependent GI tract effects that included minimal to moderate 
epithelial hyperplasia, minimal to mild neutrophilic infiltrates, and minimal single-cell necrosis in the 
lamina propria of the small and large intestines. The GI tract findings at 0.2 mg/kg were all generally 
minimal in nature. At ≥ 0.4 mg/kg, GI tract findings also included increased mandibular salivary gland 
mucin, minimal to moderate sub-acute inflammation of the glandular and nonglandular stomach, and, 
at 0.8/0.6 mg/kg, minimal to mild erosions of the glandular stomach and ulceration of the non-
glandular stomach. Gastrointestinal changes correlated with higher absolute values for WBCs, 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils (males only) at ≥ 0.4 mg/kg. Body weight 
changes also tended to correlate with GI tract effects; by the end of the dosing period, 0.4-mg/kg 
males had a 3.8% reduction (relative to controls) in body weight gain, while 0.8/0.6-mg/kg males and 
females had an 11.1% and 10.1% reduction in body weight gain, respectively. Clinical observations 
that also correlated with GI tract findings included diarrhoea, small/soft/decreased faeces, 
hypoactivity, thin appearance, and yellow material around the urogenital and anogenital areas and 
forelimbs in 0.8/0.6-mg/kg males and females. All of the GI tract and related findings were reversed or 
reversing after the 2-week recovery period. 
Lymphoid effects were also noted at ≥0.2 mg/kg and consisted of generally dose-dependent increased 
incidence of minimal to mild mesenteric lymphoid necrosis that in males was also characterized by 
lymphoid depletion. The lymphoid findings at 0.2 mg/kg were all generally minimal in nature. At ≥ 0.4 
mg/kg, additional lymphoid findings included minimal to mild neutrophil infiltrates in the red pulp of 
the spleen and minimal bone marrow hypocellularity. Neutrophilic infiltrates correlated with higher 
circulating neutrophil counts at ≥ 0.4 mg/kg. All of the lymphoid and adrenal effects were reversed or 
reversing by the end of the recovery period. 
Microscopic observations of uncertain relationship to the test article were observed in the endocrine 
system, reproductive tissues and blood vessels; these effects were: minimal to mild decreased 
vacuolation of the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex in all test article-treated male groups, 
increased lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia and increased secretion of the mammary gland in 0.8/0.6 mg/kg 
females, a single incidence of spermatid retention in the testis in one 0.8/0.6 mg/kg male, and minimal 
mononuclear perivasculitis of the meninges of the brain and spinal cord and the submucosa of the 
intestine in one 0.8/0.6 mg/kg male. Clear discharge from the eyes and red material around the nose 
and mouth in 0.8/0.6 mg/kg males and females and red material around the nose were clinical 
observations that were not clearly related to any other finding and were not observed during the 
recovery period. None of these uncertain drug-related microscopic findings were observed after the 2-
week recovery period. 
 
Two-Week (1-Cycle) Intermittent-Dose Oral Toxicology Study of Ixazomib (Report KLA00385)   
A GLP-compliant intermittent-dose study in male and female beagle dogs was conducted to evaluate 
the potential toxicity and TK of ixazomib when administered by oral gavage BIW for 2 weeks. The 
single dosing cycle was followed by a 14-day recovery period. Dogs received either vehicle (55-mM 
citrate and 1% propylene glycol, pH 5.2) or ixazomib in vehicle. High-dose males were administered 
0.3 mg/kg, but demonstrated severe toxicity on Day 1 and therefore received no additional test article, 
but were allowed to recover for 25 days before necropsy (Day 26). Macroscopic and microscopic 
pathology evaluations were only conducted on surviving 0.3-mg/kg males that were allowed to

recover. The other male groups were dosed at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, while the female dose groups were 
0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mg/kg. Each group was assigned 5 animals per sex, with 3 animals assigned to 
main study necropsy (Day 12) and 2 animals to recovery necropsy (Day 26). 
Two males at 0.3 mg/kg were euthanized on Day 5 after having received a single dose, and 1 male at 
0.2 mg/kg was euthanized on Day 9 after having received 2 doses. Dose-limiting toxicity in these 
animals was attributed to lymphoid tissue depletion and necrosis, and GI inflammation, ulceration, and 
enteropathy. Neuronal degeneration in peripheral autonomic ganglia (characterized by cell swelling, 
cytoplasmic chromatolysis with eosinophilic accumulations, and/or necrosis) may have contributed to 
functional GI effects. Additional findings in the 0.2 mg/kg male included arterial fibrinoid necrosis in 
multiple organs, and minimal axonal degeneration in the trigeminal tracts in the medulla of the brain 
and the dorsal spinal columns and/or dorsal spinal rootlets of the spinal cord. The axonal degeneration 
in the brain and spinal cord was considered a secondary effect of the injury to the peripheral ganglia 
and was characteristic of a primary sensory neuropathy. Clinical signs before death were also 
consistent with a GI disturbance (emesis; diarrhoea; and soft, mucoid with blood, and/or yellow or 
green faeces), dehydration, ataxia, decreased reflexes, and circulatory disturbances (petechiae and 
ecchymoses, erythema, and/or tachycardia), accompanied by decreased food consumption and body 
weight. 
In surviving males given a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg, similar clinical observations were observed during 
the recovery period and included thin body condition, lethargy, dehydration, tacky mucous 
membranes, cardiac arrhythmia, diarrhoea, ataxia, wide-based gait in hind-limbs, and reduced 
withdrawal and extensor carpi reflexes. Increased platelets were also observed on Day 12 in the 
surviving 0.3 mg/kg animals. 
There were no test article-related findings at 0.1 mg/kg, with the exception of minimal neuronal 
degeneration in the cervical DRG of 1 male and the lumbar DRG of another male. At ≥ 0.15 mg/kg, 
neuronal findings were also minimal in nature and included end organ ganglia degeneration in the 
salivary gland, stomach, ileum, cecum, colon, and/or rectum, and axonal degeneration of the dorsal 
column (in one 0.15-mg/kg female). Minimal neuronal degeneration of the sympathetic ganglia 
(thoracic and abdominal) was also noted at 0.2 mg/kg. In general, the microscopic nerve findings were 
minimal in severity, irrespective of dose, although there was a trend for either more affected locations 
or animals at the higher doses. Physical or neurological examination findings that correlated with 
neurotoxicity included ataxia and decreased extensor carpi reflexes in a few dogs at doses ≥ 0.2 
mg/kg. Of note, lameness was noted in 1 female each at 0.1 and 0.15 mg/kg, but not at higher doses. 
All neuronal-related effects at ≤0.15 mg/kg were reversed or reversing by the end of the 2-week 
recovery period. 
However, the neuronal injury at ≥ 0.2 mg/kg was still present after the 14 day recovery period, with 
neurological examination findings of ataxia, wide-based stance, and reduced extensor carpi reflex. In 
addition, nerve fibre degeneration in peripheral nerves and spinal cord/brain sensory tracts had a 
higher incidence or severity at the recovery necropsy; however, the timing, appearance, and location 
of this change were consistent with a primary effect in peripheral ganglia, which occurred during the 
dosing period, and secondary degeneration of associated nerve fibres during the recovery period. 
Microscopic findings observed at the recovery necropsy at  ≥0.2 mg/kg included minimal neuronal 
degeneration in the cervical and/or lumbar DRG (along with minimal to mild degeneration of nerve 
fibres associated with the DRG) and sympathetic ganglia; and minimal to moderate axonal 
degeneration of the sciatic and/or sural nerves, dorsal column of the spinal cord, and trigeminal tract 
in the medulla of the brain. 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016

Additional findings present at 0.2 mg/kg included GI tract and lymphoid effects. The GI tract findings 
were minimal or mild acute or subacute inflammation and congestion or haemorrhage of the intestines 
(males), as well as minimal chronic inflammation of the pylorus in 1 male. Microscopic GI findings 
correlated with the macroscopic findings of red discoloration of the ileum, cecum, colon, and/or rectum 
mucosa in males at ≥ 0.1 mg/kg. Lymphoid system effects were also noted at 0.2 mg/kg and included 
minimal lymphoid depletion in the Peyer’s patches (1 female), minimal neutrophilic infiltration of the 
spleen (males), and minimal thymic cortical cell depletion (in males, which correlated with decreased 
absolute and relative to body thymus weights; decreased absolute and relative thymus weights were 
also observed in males at 0.1 mg/kg and females at 0.2 mg/kg, although these were without 
microscopic correlates). Minimal and/or mild erosion and inflammation of the tongue in males at 0.2 
mg/kg may have been test article related, or may have been a result of gavage trauma. Clinical 
observations at 0.2 mg/kg consistent with GI tract injury included soft faeces and vomiting (males 
only). Increased fibrinogen, WBC, neutrophils, and monocytes at 0.2 mg/kg were also consistent with 
the GI tract inflammatory response. Decreased BUN (males only) and phosphorus (PHOS) may have 
also been related to GI tract injury. Intestinal and thymic effects were not clearly reversed after the 
end of the recovery period. 
In males at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, possible increases in QTc were observed at 1 to 2 hours after dosing 
on Day 11; however, these increases were not observed in females that had similar or higher 
exposures.  
 
Three-Month (5-Cycle) Intermittent-Dose Oral Toxicology Study of Ixazomib Citrate (Report 
WIL-416105) 
Ixazomib citrate was administered by oral gavage for 5 cycles over 94 days. Each cycle consisted of 
BIW dosing for 2 weeks separated by a 10-day non-dosing period. Cycle 5 was followed by a 14-day 
recovery period. Dogs received either vehicle (55-mM citrate and 0.45% NaCl, in SWI, USP, pH 5.8) or 
ixazomib citrate at 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 mg/kg (doses presented in terms of ixazomib). Each group 
was assigned 3 main study animals/sex; the control, 0.10 mg/kg, and 0.15 mg/kg groups each had an 
additional 3 recovery animals/sex/group. After the 5 cycles of dose administration, 3 main study 
animals/sex/group were euthanized on Day 95, and the remaining recovery animals (up to 
3/sex/group) were euthanized on Day 109 after a 14-day recovery period.  
There was no early mortality in any of the animals dosed with ixazomib. There were no test article-
related changes in body weights, food consumption, organ weights, ophthalmic or ECG parameters, 
clinical pathology, or macroscopic observations at any dose level. 
At ≥ 0.10 mg/kg, test article-related microscopic findings included minimal to mild neuronal 
degeneration of the sympathetic, dorsal root, peripheral autonomic (salivary gland), and end organ 
ganglia, and minimal secondary axonal/nerve fibre degeneration of the peripheral nerves and 
ascending tracts in the axonal and dorsal columns of the spinal cord. After the 14-day recovery period, 
the primary neuronal degeneration of the DRG and secondary effects observed in the peripheral nerves 
and spinal cord were reversed at 0.10 mg/kg and reversing at 0.15 mg/kg. An increased incidence of 
clear ocular discharge was also noted at ≥ 0.10 mg/kg. 
  Nine-Month (10-Cycle) Intermittent Dose Oral Toxicology Study of Ixazomib Citrate (Report 
WIL-416164) 
Ixazomib citrate was administered by oral gavage for 9 months (10 dosing cycles) followed by a 2-
week recovery period. Dogs received either vehicle (55-mM citrate buffer and 0.45% NaCl in SWI, USP 
[pH 5.8]) or ixazomib citrate at 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 mg/kg (doses in terms of ixazomib) for 10 cycles. 
Each cycle consisted of QW dosing for 3 weeks with each cycle separated by a 13-day non-dosing

period. Each group was assigned 3 main study animals/sex; the control, 0.10- and 0.20-mg/kg groups 
had an additional 3 recovery animals/sex. Main study animals were euthanized on Day 267, while 
recovery animals were euthanized on Day 280. Blood samples for TK analysis (Days 0, 14, 252, and 
266) were collected from all animals. 
All animals survived to the scheduled necropsies. There were no test article-related changes in body 
weight, food consumption, clinical observations, ECGs, neurobehavioral functional assessment, 
coagulation, or organ weights at the primary or recovery necropsies. There were also no test article-
related changes in any parameter at 0.05 mg/kg. 
At ≥0.10 mg/kg, ixazomib-associated effects in the GI tract and lymphoid tissue included minimal 
neutrophil infiltration in the stomach (predominantly in the pylorus) and intestines with neutrophil 
infiltration of the Peyer’s patches in females and the mesenteric lymph node in males and females at 
0.20 mg/kg, and minimal erosions in the stomach in males at 0.20 mg/kg. Neutrophil infiltration 
correlated with higher mean absolute counts for white blood cells, neutrophils, and monocytes at 0.20 
mg/kg. After the 2-week recovery period, stomach erosions were not present and the neutrophil 
infiltration in the lymph nodes and intestine was reversed or reversing. 
Neuronal findings were observed primarily at 0.20 mg/kg. These findings included neuronal 
degeneration of the sympathetic (celiac and stellate), dorsal root, and end organ (salivary gland) 
ganglia, and minimal secondary axonal/nerve fibre degeneration of the peripheral nerves (vagus and 
sciatic nerves, dorsal roots and mixed spinal nerves) and ascending tracts in the dorsal columns of the 
spinal cord, and in white matter tracts in the medulla oblongata of the brain (1 female only). Gliosis of 
the dorsal column of the spinal cord in 1 male and 1 female at 0.20 mg/kg and the white matter tracts 
in the brain of 1 female at 0.20 mg/kg was a secondary change to degeneration of the axons of the 
ascending tracts. At the end of the 2-week recovery period, nerve fibre degeneration of the DRG and 
an increase in axonal degeneration in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord were still present in males 
and females at 0.20 mg/kg. There were no microscopic changes noted in the brain or in the neurons of 
the peripheral ganglia (sympathetic, DRG, or end organ ganglia) in animals at the recovery necropsy.  
Additional test article-related findings at 0.20 mg/kg included decreased absolute counts for 
lymphocytes (-26%) in females, increased aspartate aminotransferase (males only [36%]), and 
decreased serum phosphorus (-19% to -20%). There were no test article-related changes in 
haematology or serum chemistry at the recovery necropsy.

Reproduction Toxicity 
  Study MLN9708-24960: Range-Finding Study for Effects of MLN9708 on Embryo-Fetal 
Development in Rats (non-GLP-compliant) 
Pregnant rats received either vehicle or ixazomib at doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg QD or 0.6 and 0.8 
mg/kg Q3D (6 rats/group). As a result of severe maternal toxicity at 0.8 mg/kg Q3D (1 animal died 
and one was euthanized on day 7), surviving animals were reassigned to 0.4 mg/kg Q3D. After dosing 
was completed, dams were euthanized on GD 20.  In rats dosed QD, decreases in body weight and 
food consumption were noted in dams in the 0.3 mg/kg group. Black-colored stools and a decrease in 
feces were observed transiently in 1 dam in the same group. No abnormal findings were observed in 
placentae or foetuses in any group. The NOAEL was determined to be 0.1 mg/kg (AUC24 = 184 
hr*ng/mL) for dams and > 0.3 mg/kg for foetuses. 
In rats dosed Q3D, at 0.6 mg/kg, decreases in body weight and food consumption was noted. Fetal 
weights were decreased and, although not statistically significant, there may have been a trend 
towards decreased fetal viability and increased post-implantation loss at 0.6 mg/kg. At necropsy on 
day 20 of gestation, no treatment-related findings were observed in any group (0.6 and 0.4 mg/kg). 
There were no statistically significant differences in the number of corpora lutea or implants and no 
treatment-related findings between the control group and treated group. The NOAEL was determined 
to be 0.4 mg/kg/3 days (AUC24 = 291 hr*ng/mL) for both dams and foetuses.  
  Study MLN9708-26378: Effects of MLN9708 on Embryo-Fetal Development in Rats 
A GLP-compliant study was conducted to evaluate the embryo-fetal developmental toxicity of ixazomib, 
as ixazomib citrate, administered PO to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats on GD 6, 9, 12, and 15. Rats 
received either vehicle or ixazomib at doses of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg (20 rats/group). After dosing 
was completed, main study dams were euthanized on GD 20.

Two dams administered 0.6 mg/kg were found dead on GD 7 and 8. Clinical signs in this group 
included soiled fur and decreased feces. Decreased maternal body weights with corresponding 
decreases in food consumption were noted at all dose levels. Examination at necropsy revealed small 
thymus in the 0.4- and 0.6-mg/kg groups, and a black discoloration on the stomach was observed in 1 
animal at 0.6 mg/kg. No test article-related effects on the number of corpora lutea or implants were 
noted in any group, nor were there any test article-related effects in the macroscopic findings for the 
placentae. In the fetal examinations, the post-implantation loss rate, number of live fetuses, sex ratio, 
and fetal body weights were comparable among groups.  
No test article-related effects were noted in the external observations in any group, or in the 
visceral/skeletal observations or number of sacro-caudal vertebrae in the 0.6-mg/kg group, relative to 
control.  
From these results, the NOAEL was determined to be 0.2 mg/kg/3 days (GD 15 AUC24201 
hr*ng/mL) for general toxicity of dams and 0.6 mg/kg/3 days for reproductive toxicity and embryo-
fetal development. 
  Study WIL-416156: An Oral (Gavage) Dose Range-Finding Study of MLN9708 on Embryo/Fetal 
Development in Rabbits (GLP compliant) 
MLN9708 doses of 0 (vehicle control), 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.2 mg/kg were administered by oral gavage 
(6 females/each group) to pregnant New Zealand White [Hra:(NZW)SPF] rabbits approximately twice 
weekly on GD 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19. After dosing was completed, dams were euthanized on GD 29. 
One dam in the 1.2 mg/kg group was found dead on GD 11. Two dams in the same group were 
euthanized in extremis (on GD 13 and GD 19) as a result of marked body weight losses and reduced 
food consumption. Clinical signs in these animals included decreased defecation, soft stool, diarrhea, 
mucoid feces, and brown material on the body surface. 
At all doses, generally transient decreases in mean body weight and food consumption were noted in 
 0.5 
mg/kg. Surviving animals at 1.2 mg/kg also had lower gravid uterine weights than those observed in 
controls (14.1%).  
Embryo-fetal effects were observed at 1.0 mg/kg and included post-implantation loss (early and late 
resorptions) and reduced fetal viability. There were no changes in intrauterine growth and no clear 
ixazomib-related fetal malformations or developmental variations at any dose.  
The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was  0.25 mg/kg (GD 19 AUC72549 hr*ng/mL) and for embryo-fetal 
effects was 0.5 mg/kg (GD 19 AUC72956 hr*ng/mL). 
  Study 9708-28154: Effects of MLN9708 on Embryo-Fetal Development in Rabbits (GLP-
compliant) 
Ixazomib citrate was administered on GD 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 PO to pregnant New Zealand white 
rabbits. Rabbits received either vehicle or ixazomib at 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 mg/kg (20 animals/group). After 
dosing was completed, dams were euthanized on GD 28.  
There were no test article-related deaths, abortions, or premature delivery in any group. 
At doses≥ 0.3 mg/kg, there were decreases in maternal body weight, body weight gain, and/or food 
consumption along with decreased feces. In the 1.0 mg/kg group, loose stool and soiled fur were also 
observed. There were no test article-related effects on the numbers of corpora lutea or implants, and 
on the placentae in any group. In the fetal examinations, no test article-related effects were noted in

the sex ratio, fetal weights, or visceral observations in any group. The frequency of abnormalities in 
caudal vertebrae was increased in the 1.0-mg/kg group, and 2 fetuses with caudal abnormalities 
showed short tail at external observation. In the skeletal variations, the frequency of the variation in 
the number of lumbar vertebrae and full supernumerary ribs was increased at doses≥ 0.3 mg/kg. 
However, the relationship between the pharmacological action and the skeletal features observed in 
this study was unclear. 
The NOAEL of ixazomib was 0.1 mg/kg/3 days (GD 19 AUC24 189 hr*ng/mL) for maternal toxicity 
and embryo-fetal development and  1.0 mg/kg/3 days for reproductive function.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance of ixazomib was evaluated on the basis of the examination of injection sites or sites 
associated with oral gavage administration. Additionally, ixazomib citrate was tested in an in vitro 
human whole blood haemolysis assay to assess IV tolerance. 
When evaluated in GLP-compliant PO toxicity studies up to 6 months (7 cycles) in rats and up to 9 
months (10 cycles) in dogs, ixazomib (administered as ixazomib or as ixazomib citrate), at doses that 
were tolerated, had no local adverse effects on the upper GI tract.  
When evaluated in repeat-dose IV GLP-compliant toxicity studies in rats and dogs, ixazomib 
(administered as ixazomib or as ixazomib citrate) had no local adverse effects at injection sites. 
Additionally, ixazomib and ixazomib citrate did not induce haemolysis in in vitro human whole blood 
assays. 
Other toxicity studies 
The purity of ixazomib citrate and ixazomib used in GLP-compliant studies was  99.0% and  98.24%, 
respectively. The impurity profile of the batches used for GLP-compliant studies was generally 
consistent with that of the batches used in pivotal clinical trials. In the GLP-compliant repeated-dose 
toxicology studies, total impurities in the drug substance or drug product of ixazomib citrate or 
ixazomib were  0.25% or 1.79%, respectively. Of note, 2 potential impurities were also identified as 
Assessment report

metabolites M1 and M12 in rats and are therefore qualified as impurities in the drug substance. 
Additionally metabolite M3, another potential drug substance impurity, was detected as an in vitro 
metabolite in rats, dogs, and humans, but was not observed in vivo in animals because metabolite M3 
was likely further metabolized into metabolite M12. 
In a non-GLP-compliant phototoxicity study (MLN9708-24442) mouse embryonic BALB/3T3 cells were 
incubated with up to 400 ug/mL of ixazomib citrate for 1 hour and then irradiated for 50 minutes with 
ultraviolet A (UVA) light at a dose of 5 J/cm2. Cells were washed and then incubated for 19 to 22 
hours, and cell viability was determined.  No precipitation of the drug was observed in cell medium at 
any concentration in either the nonirradiated or irradiated state. The concentration producing 50% 
inhibition (IC50) of cell viability for ixazomib was 30.579 ug/mL in the non-irradiated state and 19.806 
ug/mL in the irradiated state. The photo-irritation-factor (PIF) was 1.54, which was not phototoxic (PIF 
< 2).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Ixazomib will be used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. There were no non-
clinical studies to investigate the efficacy of this triple combination. No statement for the rationale for 
the proposed use of this combination could be found in the non-clinical dossier. Only the combination 
of ixazomib and lenalidomide were evaluated non-clinically. One study was conducted to evaluate the 
effects of combining ixazomib with lenalidomide using in vitro viability assays in MM cell lines. The 
combination of ixazomib with lenalidomide demonstrated synergistic effects on cell viability in the 
ANBL-6 and NCI-H929 cell lines, and additive effects in the RPMI-8226 and MM.1S cell lines. 
Notwithstanding the lack of non-clinical data, the efficacy of the triple combination is considered to be

based on the first interim analysis of clinical study C16010 (Clinical Efficacy section). The clinical data 
indicated that there is no need for additional non-clinical data. 
Ixazomib demonstrated consequences of proteasome inhibition, as evidenced in cultured human 
embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293) by stabilization of the 4xUb-Luc reporter, inhibition of the NF-κB-
luciferase reporter, and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. The exploratory objectives reported in 
clinical study C16010 include the evaluation of the potential relationship between response or 
resistance to ixazomib treatment and proteasome and NF-kB-related genes, such as tumour necrosis 
factor receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF-3), in blood samples. For median PFS, the HRs favoured the 
ixazomib regimen over the placebo regimen: in any case the statistically significance was reached, 
(HR=0.633; 95% CI: 0.411, 0.974; p=0.036). This data will be re-analyzed later in combination with 
gene expression. Moreover, data for TRAF-3 genotyping will be available. The Applicant was 
recommended to submit data analysis of TRAF-3 genotyping in patients enrolled in study C16010 after 
authorisation and at the same time to submit a re-analysis of preliminary data (however, the issues 
identified in the application prevent recommending to grant a marketing authorisation). 
Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies both in vitro (on hERG channels) and in vivo (in telemetered 
dogs following single oral administration) demonstrated no effects of ixazomib on cardiovascular or 
respiratory functions at AUC more than 8-fold higher than the clinical value. Ixazomib has an 
acceptable safety pharmacology profile for the proposed indication. 
Absorption was rapid after PO administration in both rats and dogs and slow after PO administration to 
rabbits. After a single PO dose of [14C] ixazomib citrate to Long-Evans rats, drug-derived radioactivity 
was widely distributed for up to 672 hours post-dose. After a single IV dose of [14C] ixazomib to 
Sprague-Dawley rats, drug-derived radioactivity was distributed widely up to 72 hours post-dose into 
most tissues, except those of the CNS. Also, exposure to total radioactivity in the dorsal root ganglion 
(DRG) was similar to that in the blood, and all drug-related material in blood was determined to be 
ixazomib. In mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, plasma protein binding of ixazomib was 
moderate to high. Ixazomib showed RBC partitioning in a concentration-dependent and saturable 
manner, which is most likely because of its binding to the proteasomes in RBCs. 
All metabolites found in human liver microsome (HLM) studies were also found in rat and dog liver 
microsomal studies. In an in vitro study investigating CYP isoenzyme induction there was a decrease in 
CYP isozyme immune-reactive protein levels, the cause of which is unknown, however it may be the 
result of cytotoxicity.  
The in vitro cell based studies showed that ixazomib is not a substrate of hepatic OATPs, and thus 
OATP inhibitors or genetic polymorphisms are unlikely to affect the disposition of ixazomib. 
Additionally, ixazomib is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, or MRP2 at concentrations up to 100 µM, and 
OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OAT1B3, MATE1, and MATE2-K at concentrations up to 10.0 µM.  
A package of non-GLP- and GLP-compliant toxicology studies was conducted in several species (mice, 
rats, rabbits, and dogs). These studies included single and repeated dose PO and IV administration 
studies (with the duration of PO administration studies up to 6 months in rats and 9 months in dogs), 
genotoxicity studies, reproductive and developmental toxicology studies, and an in vitro phototoxicity 
study. The repeated-dose studies were conducted using a cyclical intermittent dosing schedule (21-day 
cycle) that was either more frequent than the clinical schedule, or in the case of the chronic studies, 
the same as the clinical schedule (28-day cycle).  
It is noteworthy that a definitive cause of death in rats was not established for either single-dose or 
repeated-dose studies, but was attributed to GI tract and lymphoid toxicity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 49/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In multi-cycle repeated-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs, the principal target organs 
included the gastrointestinal tract, lymphoid tissues, and the nervous system.  In the 9 month study 
(10 cycles) in dogs orally administered with a dosing schedule mimicking the clinical regimen (28 day 
cycle), microscopic neuronal effects were generally minimal in nature and only observed at 0.2 mg/kg 
(4 mg/m2). The majority of target organ findings demonstrated partial to full recovery following 
discontinuation of treatment, with the exception of neuronal findings in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion 
and dorsal column. 
Peripheral neuropathy involving sensory nerve axons has also been observed in monkeys, mice and 
dogs with bortezomib. In a clinical trial with ixazomib neuropathy was reported with an increased 
incidence in the treated group compared to the placebo group.  
Ixazomib caused embryo-foetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits only at maternally toxic doses and 
at exposures that were slightly higher than those observed in patients receiving the recommended 
dose. Studies of fertility and early embryonic development and pre- and post-natal toxicology were not 
conducted with ixazomib, but evaluation of reproductive tissues was conducted in the general toxicity 
studies. There were no effects due to ixazomib treatment on male or female reproductive organs in 
studies up to 6-months duration in rats and up to 9 months duration in dogs. 
Ninlaro can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity. 
It is unknown whether ninlaro or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. No animal data are 
available. Ixazomib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay) or 
clastogenic in a bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice. Ixazomib was positive in an in vitro 
clastogenicity test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, ixazomib was negative in an in 
vivo comet assay in mice, in which percent tail DNA was assessed in the stomach and liver. Therefore, 
the weight of evidence indicates that ixazomib is not considered to present a genotoxic risk. 
Following oral administration, a tissue distribution study in rats revealed that the brain and spinal cord 
were amongst the tissues with the lowest levels, suggesting that the penetration of ixazomib through 
the blood-brain barrier appears to be limited. However, the relevance to humans is unknown. 
In a non-GLP-compliant phototoxicity study in BALB/3T3 clone A31 cells ixazomib did not elicit any 
phototoxic response.  
The data indicated that ixazomib under the proposed therapeutic regimen, will not pose an immediate 
risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability of ixazomib was assessed using population PK analysis. The analysis was 
performed using PK data from 755 patients (108, IV administration; 647, oral administration) across 
10 clinical studies. Ixazomib absorption is fast, with an overall median Tmax of approximately 1 hour 
post dose on both Days 1 and 15. After achieving Cmax, ixazomib exhibited a multi-exponential 
disposition profile. 
After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations of ixazomib were achieved at approximately one 
hour after dosing. The mean absolute oral bioavailability is 58%. Ixazomib AUC increases in a dose 
proportional manner over a dose range of 0.2 to 10.6 mg. 
In study C16009 patients received a single oral dose of 4 mg ixazomib either under fed or fasted 
conditions on Day 1 and again under the alternative food intake condition on Day 15. The fed 
conditions involved administration of ixazomib within 1 hour of starting consumption of a high-fat 
breakfast (consisting of 800-1000 calories in total, of which 50% are from fat). The median Tmax was 
3 hours later under fed compared with fasted conditions and Cmax and AUC0-216 were reduced by 69% 
and 28%, respectively, in the fed condition. 
Distribution 
Ixazomib is 99% bound to plasma proteins and distributes into red blood cells with a blood-to-plasma 
AUC ratio of 10. The steady-state volume of distribution is 543 L. 
Elimination 
Mean plasma clearance is 1.86 L/hr, blood clearance is lower therefore hepatic extraction is low.  The 
plasma elimination half-life is 9.5 days.  Blood elimination half-life appears longer (Study C16007). 
In part A of Study C16016 (phase 1, 2-part, open-label study designed to characterize the mass 
balance, PK, metabolism, and excretion of oral ixazomib) 7  patients were enrolled and received a 
single oral solution of 4.1 mg [14C]-ixazomib containing approximately 500 nCi of TRA on Day 1. Blood 
was collected at predetermined time points for analyses of plasma PK of ixazomib over a 14-day 
period, urine PK and excretion of ixazomib over a 7-day period, plasma and whole blood TRA, and 
metabolite profiles over a 35-day period. 
Complete urinary and faecal output was collected continuously during the initial confinement period 
(Days 1-8) for analysis of TRA and biotransformation products. On Days 14 and 21, patients were 
administered a single 4 mg ixazomib capsule. Patients were to return to the clinic in the evening before 
Days 14, 21, 28, and 35 for a 24-hour overnight clinic visit. To ensure defecation, two 15-mL oral 
doses of Milk of Magnesia were recommended to be administered 2 hours apart in the clinic in the 
evening on Day 7 and the evening of each overnight clinic visit (Days 13, 20, 27, and 34). One blood 
sample was collected at pre-dose on each of these site visit days. Urine and faecal samples were 
collected during the 24-hour overnight visits. Patients were instructed to collect faeces for a 24-hour 
period 1 day prior to returning to the clinic for their overnight visits. 
After administration of a single oral dose of 14C-ixazomib to 5 patients with advanced cancer, 62% of 
the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and 22% in the faeces. Unchanged ixazomib 
accounted for < 3.5% of the administered dose recovered in urine. 
The combined TRA recovery from urine and faeces in Patient 58001-002 was 115% primarily due to a 
higher recovery (96.0%) in the urine compared to the other 4 patients in the PK-evaluable population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 52/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Without data from Patient 58001-002, the mean (±SD) TRA recoveries of administered radioactivity 
from urine, faeces, and combined urine and faeces were 53.6±10.8%, 22.6±3.40%, and 
76.2±13.0%, respectively, in 4 patients. On average (n=5), the total cumulative excretion of 
ixazomib-derived radioactivity in urine and feces was 59.0% by Day 14 after dosing. The excretion rate 
reached a plateau on Day 28 (mean total recovery of 79.4%) with less than 1% daily increment of 
changes thereafter.  
In vitro biliary excretion of ixazomib was evaluated in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes (SCHH), 
which were incubated with either 10 μM ixazomib or 5 μM [14C]-ixazomib. The mean biliary 
elimination index (BEI) for ixazomib was 0, whereas the mean BEI for total radioactivity was 7.2.  
Based on the plasma AUC0-312h ratio of ixazomib and ixazomib-related TRA, ixazomib accounted for the 
majority (% Mean±SD:70.0±14.2%) of the circulating component. Terminal half-life is not reported 
since limited PK sampling did not allow for its accurate determination. 
Seven major metabolites of ixazomib were identified in hepatic microsomes derived from male CD-1 
mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans (pooled, male and 
female), and none were unique to humans. Oxidative deboronation of ixazomib to the hemiaminal 
metabolite (M1) was the major biotransformation pathway evident in all species. In human liver 
microsomal extracts, M1 was the major metabolite, followed by M3, while M2, M8, M12, M15, M19, and 
M20 were observed at lower levels. Human hepatocyte incubations showed M1 and M3 as the dominant 
metabolites, with M8 in smaller quantities. 
The metabolism of ixazomib was preliminarily explored in 3 patients after oral administration of 
ixazomib 2 mg/m2 twice weekly (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle) in Study C16003. Plasma 
samples obtained after dosing on Days 1 and 11 were pooled and analysed for preliminary metabolite 
identification. Unchanged ixazomib was the major drug-related component observed on both days in 
human plasma. Only 1 metabolite (M8) was present in appreciable levels (~10% of parent by 
comparison of AUC0-8h). Other metabolites previously identified in human liver microsomes or human 
hepatocytes were not detected in human plasma. 
The contribution of 7 CYP isozymes to ixazomib metabolism was evaluated using human 
complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) CYP-expressing recombinant microsomes (rCYPs). The 
percentage contribution of individual CYP isozymes to the liver microsomal metabolism of ixazomib was 
then calculated using abundance factors for these CYP isozymes. At the 10 μM substrate concentration, 
CYP3A4 was the major CYP isozyme contributing to the metabolism of ixazomib, followed by CYP1A2. 
The relative contributions of the 7 major CYP isozymes were: 3A4 (42.3%), 1A2 (26.1%), 2B6 
(16.0%), 2C8 (6.0%), 2D6 (4.8%), CYP2C19 (4.8%) and 2C9 (<1%). Note that this study was 
conducted at supra-therapeutic concentrations (10 μM ixazomib) that are >90-fold higher than the 
geometric mean clinical Cmax (0.11 μM) at the 4 mg oral once-weekly dose. 
At 0.1 and 0.5 μM substrate concentrations, which are closer to clinical circulating concentrations of 
ixazomib following oral administration at a dose of 4 mg (geometric mean Cmax of 0.11 μM), there 
was little difference between the rates of metabolism of ixazomib in rCYP isozymes and in the presence 
of only control protein.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In Study C16004, ixazomib was administered orally once weekly for 3 weeks (Days 1, 8, and 15) in 
28-day cycles. Patients with RRMM were enrolled into the following dosing cohorts: 0.24, 0.48, 0.80, 
1.20, 1.68, 2.23, 2.97, and 3.95 mg/m2. Blood samples were collected at multiple time points after

dosing on Days 1 and 15 to characterize the plasma PK profile of ixazomib. The Day 1 and Day 15 
plasma PK parameters are summarised in Table 19.

the accumulation ratio. 
The geometric mean terminal half-life for ixazomib is 9.5 days based on the population PK analysis.  
For both IV and oral dosing, there is an approximately average 3-fold accumulation (based on AUC 
ratio) following the Day 11 dose for the twice-weekly schedule (C16001, C16003, C16008) and a 2-
fold accumulation (based on AUC ratio) following the Day 15 dose for the once-weekly schedule 
(C16002, C16004, C16007, C16005).  
Trough concentrations increase throughout Cycle 1, indicating that the steady state is not achieved 
with the twice-weekly or once-weekly dosing regimens by the time of administration of the last dose in 
a cycle. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCL ≥30 mL/min) have been included in all clinical 
studies during the development of ixazomib. CrCL (≥30 mL/min) was not identified as a significant 
covariate in the population PK model. The magnitudes of percent difference in AUC at the 5th or 95th 
percentiles of CrCL relative to the median AUC was <20% suggesting lack of a clinically meaningful 
impact of CrCL (≥30 mL/min) on ixazomib PK. 
A dedicated study (Study C16015) in patients with renal impairment was also performed in patients 
with severe renal impairment and in ESRD patients requiring hemodialysis. In Study C16015, a single 
dose of ixazomib (3 mg) was administered orally in the PK cycle to patients with normal renal function 
(Arm 1; CrCL ≥90 mL/min) and to patients with severe renal impairment (Arm 2; CrCL <30 mL/min, 
including patients with ESRD, which was defined as renal failure requiring hemodialysis).  CrCL for 
entry into the study was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. ESRD patients requiring 
hemodialysis were enrolled such that the first hemodialysis treatment was approximately 24 to 28 
hours postdose. Blood samples were collected at multiple time points after dosing (up to 336 hours) to 
characterize the plasma PK of ixazomib. The results are presented in Table 21.

In the clinical study C16015, the AUC is 39% and 34% higher respectively in patients with severe renal 
impaired patients and those with ESRD than in those with normal function.   
Accordingly, a reduced starting dose of ixazomib (3 mg) is recommended in these groups of patients. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin>1-1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) 
have been included in all clinical studies during the development of ixazomib, including Study C16010. 
Bilirubin was not identified as a significant covariate on clearance in the population PK model, and 
differences in the individual predicted exposures suggested no clinically meaningful impact of total 
bilirubin (>1-1.5xULN) on ixazomib PK.  
A dedicated study in patients with hepatic impairment was also performed. Study C16018 was a phase 
1 pharmacokinetic study of oral ixazomib in patients with advanced solid tumours or hematologic 
malignancies with varying degrees of liver dysfunction (as defined by the National Cancer Institute 
Organ Dysfunction Working Group). Out of 48 patients enrolled in the study a total of 43 patients were 
PK evaluable (12 with normal hepatic function, 13 with moderate hepatic impairment, and 18 with 
severe hepatic impairment). Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 hepatic function groups on the basis of 
their total bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values. The dose of ixazomib was dependent 
on hepatic function. Patients with normal function, moderate or severe impairment received 4 mg, 2.3 
mg and 1.5 mg ixazomib, respectively. The results are presented in Table 22.

Unbound  dose-normalized  AUC0-last  was  increased  by  27%  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe

Therefore, a reduced starting dose (3 mg) of ixazomib is recommended for patients with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment.

Gender 
The effect of sex as a covariate on AUC was evaluated in Population PK analysis and was found to be 
no significant. 
Race 
Two studies were conducted in Asian populations: C16013 (Asian) and TB-MC010034 (Japanese). 
In Study C16013, ixazomib (4 mg) was administered orally once weekly for 3 weeks (Days 1, 8, and 
15) in 28-day cycles. Patients also received lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21, and 
dexamethasone (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22, in 28-day cycles. Blood samples were collected at 
multiple time points after ixazomib administration on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 to characterize the PK 
of ixazomib, in combination with Lenalinomide and Dexamethasone, in adult Asian patients with RRMM. 
A total of 24 patients (10 Chinese, 10 Korean and 4 ‘‘Other’’) enrolled in Singapore, Hong Kong and 
South Korea were included in the PK-evaluable population. 
Ixazomib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration on both Days 1 and 15 with the overall median 
Tmax in Asian patients of 1.5 hours and 2 hours, respectively. Ixazomib plasma concentrations 
declined in a multiexponential manner with a slow terminal phase. The overall geometric mean t1/2 
after multiple dosing was 144 hours (6 days) and the geometric mean accumulation ratio for AUC0-168 
on Day 15 was 2.46. AUC0-168 values in the 3 Asian subgroups were similar after both single and 
multiple dosing. Additionally, a <25% difference in the Day 15 geometric mean AUC0-168 was noted 
across the Asian subgroups/races.  
In study TB-MC010034 mean plasma concentrations of ixazomib in ixazomib monotherapy were higher 
than those observed in the combination therapy cohort on Day 1: however, similar profiles for 
ixazomib were observed in ixazomib monotherapy and combination therapy on Day 15. Ixazomib was 
rapidly absorbed after single and multiple oral dose administration, both as monotherapy and 
combination therapy, with a median Tmax of 1-2 hours. After Tmax, ixazomib concentrations declined 
in a multiexponential manner with a slow terminal phase (geometric mean t1/2 of 125 hours in the 
combination therapy cohort to 137 hours in the monotherapy cohort). The accumulation ratios for 
AUC0-168 after monotherapy and combination therapy were approximately 2.1 and 1.8, respectively. 
The effect of race on the PK of ixazomib was investigated using population PK analysis (Figure 4).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
 
In vitro 
Metabolism appears to be the major route of elimination for ixazomib. In vitro studies indicated that 
ixazomib is metabolized by multiple CYP450 and non-CYP enzymes/proteins. The effect of strong 
CYP1A2 inhibitors on the PK of ixazomib was examined in the population PK analysis. These CYPs were 
chosen for investigation based on the rank order of relative biotransformation activity for 10 μM 
ixazomib of the major human CYP isozymes where they contributed >25% to the metabolism of 
ixazomib in rCYPs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016

Ixazomib is neither a time-dependent nor reversible inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, CYP2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 (IC50 >30 μM, Ki >15 μM), therefore the potential for ixazomib to produce 
DDIs via CYP isozyme inhibition is low. Ixazomib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 activity 
or corresponding immunoreactive protein levels under conditions where prototypical inducers caused 
anticipated increases in CYP activity (with ixazomib concentrations up to 9.67 μM). Therefore, ixazomib 
is unlikely to produce DDIs via induction of metabolism- or transporter-mediated clearance of co-
administered drugs, as it did not induce expression of any of the representative sensitive downstream 
CYP enzymes that are induced via AhR (eg, CYP1A2), CAR (eg, CYP2B6) or PXR (eg, CYP3A4/5). 
Ixazomib is not a substrate of OATP transporters in human hepatocytes based on comparison of 
ixazomib uptake rates in the presence and absence of known OATP inhibitors (rifampin and 
cyclosporine A). On the basis of these in vitro findings, there is low probability of ixazomib disposition 
being affected by OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 inhibitors or inducers, or by clinically meaningful genetic 
polymorphisms in OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
Ixazomib was not evaluated in vitro as a potential substrate of OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. However, these 
renal uptake transporters are unlikely to be major determinants of ixazomib clearance, as the renal 
clearance of unchanged ixazomib (0.119 L/hr, Study C16016) is approximately 3.7% of ixazomib CL/F 
and 6.4% of CL. In addition, the renal clearance of unchanged ixazomib (0.119 L/hr) is similar to the 
product of the fraction unbound and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (fu*GFR=0.072 L/hr), suggesting 
that glomerular filtration instead of active secretion is the predominant mechanism of renal clearance. 
As such, the risk of DDIs between ixazomib and inhibitors or inducers of OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 is 
predicted to be low. 
Ixazomib was shown in vitro to be a low affinity substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp but not BCRP 
or MRP2. The membrane permeation clearance (Vmax/Km) of ixazomib by passive diffusion and efflux 
transporters was 10.6 and 2.4 µL/hr, respectively. P-gp-mediated transport accounted for 19% of the 
total transport of ixazomib in Caco-2 cells, indicating the contribution of P-gp to the overall membrane 
permeation clearance of ixazomib is low. Considering the low contribution of P-gp to the permeability 
clearance of ixazomib in Caco-2 cells, and the physicochemical properties of ixazomib (moderate 
permeability and high solubility), it is unlikely that P-gp-mediated efflux in the intestine is a major 
determinant of the absolute oral bioavailability of ixazomib. Consistently, ixazomib showed dose-linear 
PK following oral dosing over the 0.2 to 10.6 mg dose range (from population PK analysis). In addition, 
biliary secretion and renal secretion of unchanged ixazomib are estimated to be minor routes of 
elimination relative to hepatic metabolism. A low extent of biliary elimination of ixazomib (<10% BEI) 
was observed in human hepatocytes. Furthermore, renal clearance of unchanged ixazomib accounts for 
approximately 3.7% of ixazomib CL/F and 6.4% of CL, and as noted earlier, is consistent with passive 
glomerular filtration as opposed to active tubular secretion.  
Studies in Caco-2 cells showed that ixazomib is not an inhibitor of P-gp or BCRP (IC50 >100 μM) and 
studies in the MRP2-transfected membrane vesicle model, showed ixazomib is not an inhibitor of MRP2 
at concentrations of 0.02 to 100 μM. Consequently, ixazomib is not anticipated to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, 
or MRP2 at total maximum plasma concentrations or at estimated intestinal lumen concentrations 
associated with a 4 mg oral dose of ixazomib administered once weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-
day cycle. Given the low risk of DDIs between ixazomib and P-gp, BCRP, or MRP2 substrates, in vivo 
DDI studies were not conducted with probe substrates of these efflux transporters. 
Ixazomib is not an inhibitor of hepatic OATPs (IC50 >10 μM). Ixazomib is therefore not expected to 
inhibit hepatic OATPs at total maximum plasma concentrations or at estimated unbound maximum 
hepatic inlet concentrations associated with a 4 mg oral dose administered once weekly on Days 1, 8, 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016

and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Therefore, the risk of ixazomib interacting with OATP substrates is predicted 
to be low. As such, in vivo DDI studies were not conducted with ixazomib and a known substrate of 
OATP. 
Studies in human hepatocytes or transporter expressing cell lines showed that ixazomib is not an 
inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT 2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE 1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant 
concentrations (IC50 >10 μM). Ixazomib is therefore not anticipated to inhibit OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 at 
unbound maximum plasma concentrations associated with a 4 mg oral dose of ixazomib administered 
once weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Ixazomib is also not expected to inhibit MATE1 or 
MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Thus, there is low potential for ixazomib to cause DDIs 
with OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2-K substrates. 
• 
In vivo 
In vivo drug-drug interaction in patients was evaluated in Study C16009. Study C16009 was a 5-arm 
phase 1 study and three of the arms were designed to assess the potential DDIs with strong CYP3A 
inhibitors (Arms 1 and 5) and CYP3A inducers (Arm 4). 
Arm 1 evaluated the effect of the strong CYP3A inhibitor, ketoconazole, on the PK. Sixteen PK-
evaluable patients received a single, 2.5 mg, oral dose of ixazomib on Day 1 in the absence of 
ketoconazole (Period 1) and on Day 15 of Cycle 1 in the presence of ketoconazole (Period 2). Oral 
ketoconazole (400 mg) was administered once daily on Days 12 through 25 of Cycle 1. Ixazomib Cmax 
was similar when ixazomib was co-administered with or without ketoconazole with a corresponding LS 
geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of 1.01 (0.78-1.30) whereas the AUC0-264 was higher (approximately 
doubled) in the presence of ketoconazole with a corresponding LS geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of 
2.08 (1.91-2.27). 
This arm (arm 1) of the study used a fixed-sequence design. A period effect on plasma exposures was 
observed during the statistical analysis of PK data from Arms 2 and 3 of this study that employed a 2-
way crossover design. The ANOVA analysis for AUC0-216, indicated higher exposures in Period 2 
versus Period 1 (ratio of Period 2 AUC to Period 1 AUC estimated as 1.63, [calculated from the 
estimate of 0.4858 on log-transformed data]). 
For this reason the true treatment effect of a strong inhibitor of CYP3A on the PK of ixazomib estimated 
in Arm 1 may have been confounded (ie, overestimated) by a potential period effect. As a result, Arm 
5 was added to the study with Amendment 4 to characterize the single-dose PK of ixazomib when co-
administered with the strong CYP3A inhibitor, clarithromycin. 
In Arm 5, after 5 days of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) pre-treatment, 15 PK-evaluable patients 
received a single 2.5 mg oral dose of ixazomib on Day 6 of Cycle 1. Twice daily administration of 
clarithromycin continued on Days 6 to 16 of Cycle 1. Ixazomib Cmax and AUC0-264 were similar when 
ixazomib was co-administered with (Arm 5) or without (Arm 1) clarithromycin with corresponding LS 
geometric mean ratios (90% CI) of 0.96 (0.67-1.36) and 1.11 (0.86-1.43), respectively. 
Arm 4 evaluated the effect of the strong CYP3A inducer, rifampin, on the PK of ixazomib. After 7 days 
of rifampin (600 mg once daily) pre-treatment, 16 PK-evaluable patients received a single 4 mg oral 
dose of ixazomib on Day 8 of Cycle 1. Administration of rifampin continued on Days 8 to 14 of Cycle 1. 
Rifampin co-administration resulted in lower plasma concentrations of ixazomib throughout the 168 
hours post-dose interval. Ixazomib Cmax was reduced in the presence of rifampin by approximately 
54%; corresponding LS geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of 0.46 (0.29-0.73). Ixazomib AUC0-last was 
reduced by approximately 74%; corresponding LS geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of 0.26 (0.18-0.37). 
Median Tmax was similar (approximately 1.5 hours) with and without rifampin co-administration.

The effect of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (eg, ciprofloxacin) on the PK of ixazomib was examined in the 
population PK analysis as a time-dependent categorical covariate. The analysis dataset included 36 
patients on ciprofloxacin (strong CYP1A2 inhibitor) during the active ixazomib treatment period. The 
population PK analysis indicated a 9% higher ixazomib AUC (95% CI of 6-12%) for patients receiving 
strong CYP1A2 inhibitors compared to those not receiving strong CYP1A2 inhibitors; thereby, 
suggesting that no dose adjustment is necessary for ixazomib when coadministered with strong 
inhibitors of this drug metabolizing enzyme. 
CYP1A2 activity is induced by smoking. Smoking status was not identified as a significant covariate in 
the population PK analysis, which suggests that CYP1A2 inducers do not significantly alter the PK of 
ixazomib. In addition, the individual predicted exposures following a single 4 mg ixazomib dose were 
calculated using the final model. The magnitude of percent difference in AUC between patients who 
self-identified themselves as current smokers and patients who have never smoked was <20% 
suggesting no clinically meaningful difference in exposures between the two groups . However, it is 
important to note that the smoking history was self-reported. 
Effect of Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone on PK of Ixazomib 
PK parameters for ixazomib coadministered with LenDex (Studies C16005 and C16008), are similar to 
those observed when ixazomib is administered as a single agent (Studies C16004 and C16003).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamic effect of ixazomib was assessed by measuring the inhibition of 20S proteasome 
activity in whole blood after once-weekly and twice-weekly IV bolus dosing of ixazomib in Studies 
C16001 and C16002. Maximum inhibition (Emax) of 20S proteasome activity occurred within 30 
Assessment report

Page 63/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
minutes in most patients, indicating rapid target engagement in blood. Maximum 20S proteasome 
inhibition was dose-dependent. Mean Emax values ranged from <10% in the 0.125 mg/m2 twice-
weekly dosing cohort to approximately 70% in the 2.34 mg/m2 twice-weekly dosing cohort in Study 
C16001. Similar results were observed following once-weekly dosing with approximately 80% inhibition 
at doses of at least 2.34 mg/m2. Prolonged inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (>24 hours) was not 
apparent in either study.  
Effect on QT interval 
PK-matched triplicate ECG measurements were collected in 4 phase 1 studies (IV studies C16001 and 
C16002, and oral studies C16003 and C16004) to develop a model relating QTc intervals to plasma 
concentrations of ixazomib. A linear mixed effects models with fixed effects (study, sex, study day, 
time), and random effects (intercept, study day) was used. Data from 245 patients evaluated at doses 
with a wide range of plasma concentrations (with 26% of data higher than mean Cmax at the 4 mg 
dose used in phase 3) had no meaningful effect on QTc based on model-predicted mean change in 
QTcF/QTcP from baseline. The predicted mean ΔΔQTcF and ΔΔQTcP (90% CI) at the geometric mean 
Cmax achieved with the 4 mg dose were 0.0710 msec (-0.221, 0.363) and 0.0591 msec (–0.242, 
0.361), respectively. The upper limits of the 90% CIs for the mean ΔΔQTcF and mean ΔΔQTcP were 
well below 5 msec even at a plasma ixazomib concentration of 200 ng/mL (~ 4-times the geometric 
mean Cmax at the 4 mg dose). Also, less than 1% had QTc values greater than 480 msec and none of 
those data points were greater than 500 msec. Only 1 observation of ΔQTcP was greater than 60 msec 
and no such observations occurred for ΔQTcF. Less than 2 % of ΔQTcF and ΔQTcP data were greater 
than 30 msec. There was no clinically meaningful effect predicted on heart rate at a Cmax of 4 mg 
once-weekly dose. 
In the pivotal study C16010, 360 patients in the ixazomib regimen and 360 patients in the placebo 
were evaluated for changes in QTcF and QTcB (Bazett’s method).  Most patients (~ 87% each arm) 
had a maximum post-dosing QTcF <450msec. Only 8 patients (3 in ixazomib/5 placebo) had a 
maximum post-dosing QTcF ≥500 msec. Increases from baseline in QTcF of ≥60 msec were observed in 
6% and 3% of patients in the ixazomib and placebo regimens, respectively.  Most patients (~ 76% 
each arm) had a maximum post-dosing QTcB <450msec. Only 26 patients (13 ixazomib/10 placebo) 
had a maximum post-dosing QTcB ≥500 msec. Increases from baseline were observed in 5% and 7% 
of patients in the ixazomib and placebo, respectively. 
Exposure response 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses was performed on the basis of pivotal data to evaluate the 
relationship between ixazomib exposure and complete response (CR), very good partial response 
(VGPR), partial response (PR) and progression-free survival (PFS). The results of the logistic regression 
analyses showed that exposure was not a predictor for the clinical efficacy responses (CR vs ≤ VGPR, 
≥ VGPR vs ≤ PR, and ≥ PR vs ≤ SD). In addition, exposure was not a significant predictor of PFS. After 
a median of 12 treatment cycles (maximum follow-up of 26 cycles) for this analysis, 80% of patients 
did not have an ixazomib dose reduction. Accordingly, the extent of inter-patient variability in time-
averaged ixazomib exposure in the study population is limited largely to that resulting from inter-
patient variability in apparent oral clearance.  
An exposure-response analysis for PFS and best clinical response was conducted based on efficacy data 
from the pivotal study C16010. The exposure metric for ixazomib was time-averaged systemic 
exposure (AUC/day). Kaplan-Meier estimates for PFS in the ixazomib+LenDex regimen were stratified 
by 4 ixazomib exposure quartiles and compared to the placebo+LenDex regimen. Median PFS 
estimates in all exposure quartiles (range: 16.8-21.4 months) in the ixazomib+LenDex regimen were 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 64/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
longer than the median PFS estimate of 14.7 months for the control. There was a similar trend of the 
treatment effect in favour of ixazomib as the hazard ratios in all ixazomib exposure quartiles were <1 
(range 0.646 -0.794). Ixazomib exposure at the 4 mg once weekly dose was not a significant predictor 
of PFS. 
Exposure and best response rates (CR, ≥VGPR, and ≥PR) analysis also showed ixazomib exposure at 
the 4 mg once weekly dose was not a statistically significant predictor of clinical responses. After a 
median 12 treatment cycles (max 26 cycles) for this analysis, 80% of patients did not have an 
ixazomib dose reduction. 
The MTD of once-weekly ixazomib in combination with a 28-day cycle of LenDex was established at 
2.97 mg/m2 (equivalent to 5.5 mg fixed dose). However, DLTs experienced in the dose-escalation 
cohorts overall included nausea, vomiting, syncope, rash, and peripheral neuropathy. Although the 
2.97 mg/m2 dose (equivalent to 5.5 mg fixed dose) of ixazomib was generally tolerable, it was noted 
that this ixazomib dose may compromise the dose of lenalidomide (ie, lead to dose reduction); the 
median dose intensity for lenalidomide was 84.6% and 96.0% for the 2.97 mg/m2 (equivalent to 5.5 
mg fixed dose) and 2.23 mg/m2 (equivalent to 4 mg fixed dose) doses, respectively. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ixazomib citrate was not detected in Sprague-Dawley rat, beagle dog, or human plasma samples 
spiked with high concentrations of ixazomib citrate (up to 29 µM). Instead, only a substantial peak 
corresponding to ixazomib was observed, indicating that ixazomib citrate rapidly and completely 
converts to ixazomib in plasma. 
The bioanalysis of the nonclinical and clinical study samples used an ixazomib analytical reference 
standard, which is a mixture of its boroxine, free acid and oligomeric forms. Current methodology is 
unable to determine the exact percentage of the boroxine, free acid and oligomeric forms in the 
mixture for a given lot of material, and previous bioanalysis was conducted assuming 100% free 
boronic acid in the reference standard. Therefore, the maximum possible underestimation in results 
associated with assuming that the reference standard comprises 100% boronic acid (the free acid) is 
5.3%; this potential underestimation is deemed not to have a meaningful impact on the bioanalytical 
results for the nonclinical and clinical studies. 
In the ADME study, the mean total recovery of the administered radioactive dose was 84%, with 62% 
of the dose recovered in urine and 22% of the dose recovered in faeces. The mean urinary recovery of 
unchanged ixazomib in the urine was 3.2% of the administered dose.  
The extent of faecal elimination does not suggest extensive elimination of unchanged drug and the 
renal elimination does not suggest active secretion therefore the involvement of any transporters, with 
the exception of hepatic uptake, in the elimination can probably be discounted. 
The results of the ADME study are incomplete as metabolite identification of plasma, urine and faeces 
is not reported over a long enough time scale. The applicant was recommended to provide after 
authorisation information from the human ADME study on the drug related components in excreta post 
7 days, preferably up to 20 days, by concentrating samples from the current study (however, the 
issues identified in the application currently prevent recommending to grant a marketing 
authorisation).   
Metabolism appears to be a major route of elimination for ixazomib. 
In an exploratory non-radiolabelled profiling clinical study using a semi-quantitative method, 
metabolite M8 was identified to be approximately 10% of the total drug-related exposure. In the 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 65/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
definitive radiolabelled human ADME study this metabolite was below the detection limit. Therefore on 
the basis of ICH S9 and ICH M3(R2) further characterization of M8 is not warranted. This is agreed 
however, characterisation of a further two unknown metabolites in human plasma is still ongoing and 
should be available in Q2 2016.  The applicant was recommended to provide information from the 
human ADME study on the drug related components in plasma post 24 hours, by concentrating 
samples from the current study. 
It is considered that the profiling of plasma and excreta is not adequate as the time periods are too 
short. Further profiling of plasma and excreta at later time points is required before any conclusion 
from this data can be endorsed. In case of a positive opinion the applicant is recommended to submit 
the final study report for identification of the most abundant human plasmatic metabolite P1 (that is 
expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2016) together with available information on 
its qualification in plasma and excreta in non-clinical species, rat and dog.  
The PK of ixazomib is similar in patients with normal hepatic function and in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment based on the results of a population PK analysis. The PK of ixazomib was characterized in 
patients with normal hepatic function at 4 mg (N=12), moderate hepatic impairment at 2.3 mg (total 
bilirubin > 1.5 3 x ULN, N=13) or severe hepatic impairment at 1.5 mg (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN, 
N=18). Unbound dose normalized AUC was 27% higher in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment as compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Therefore, a reduced starting dose 
(3 mg) of ixazomib is recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  
The PK of ixazomib is similar in patients with normal renal function and in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min) based on the results of a population PK 
analysis.  The PK of ixazomib was characterized at a dose of 3 mg in patients with normal renal 
function (creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL/min, N=18), severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 
30 mL/min, N=14), or ESRD requiring dialysis (N=6). Unbound AUC is 39% and 34% higher 
respectively in patients with severe renal impaired patients and those with ESRD than in those with 
normal function. Therefore, a reduced starting dose of ixazomib (3 mg) is recommended in these 
groups of patients. Pre- and post dialyzer concentrations of ixazomib measured during the 
haemodialysis session were similar, suggesting that ixazomib is not dialyzable.   
There was no clinically meaningful effect of age (23- 91 years), sex, body surface area (1.2 2.7 m2), 
or race on the clearance of ixazomib based on the results of a population PK analysis.  
Race was not identified as a statistically significant covariate in the population PK analysis. In addition, 
the individual predicted exposures following a single 4 mg ixazomib dose were calculated using the 
final model. There was no clinically meaningful difference in AUC (<20%) between Whites and Blacks. 
However, the median AUC was 35% higher in Asian patients than in Whites although there was an 
overlap in AUC across the two race groups. Despite the modestly higher AUC in Asian patients, 
exposures achieved after a 4 mg weekly dose are not expected to exceed those observed at the 
Western MTD (ie, 5.5 mg). Based on these considerations, and considering that the adverse events 
following ixazomib treatment are monitorable, reversible and manageable through protocol-specified 
dose modification guidelines, no prospective starting dose adjustment is proposed for Asian patients. 
Patients across races, including patients enrolled in Asian countries, are being administered a common 
global dose of ixazomib in the ongoing phase 3 clinical program, including Study C16010. 
Co administration of ixazomib with clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not result in a clinically 
meaningful change in the systemic exposure of ixazomib.  Ixazomib Cmax was decreased by 4% and 
AUC was increased by 11%. Therefore, no dose modification is required for ixazomib with co 
administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors.   
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 66/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co administration of ixazomib with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors did not result in a clinically meaningful 
change in the systemic exposure of ixazomib based on the results of a population pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis.  Therefore, no dose modification is required for ixazomib with co administration of strong 
CYP1A2 inhibitors.   
Co administration of ixazomib with rifampicin decreased ixazomib Cmax by 54% and AUC by 74%. 
Therefore, co administration of strong CYP3A inducers with ixazomib is not recommended.   
Ixazomib is not a reversible or a time dependent inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 
3A4/5. Ixazomib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 activity or corresponding 
immunoreactive protein levels.  Ixazomib is not expected to produce drug drug interactions via CYP 
inhibition or induction.   
Ixazomib is a low affinity substrate of P gp. Ixazomib is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP2 or hepatic 
OATPs. Ixazomib is not an inhibitor of P gp, BCRP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, 
MATE1, or MATE2 K. Ixazomib is not expected to cause transporter mediated drug drug interactions.   
The effect of ixazomib on the PK of lenalidomide and dexamethasone has not been directly studied. 
Lenalidomide undergoes minimal metabolism and is predominantly renally cleared. In addition, in vitro 
studies using human liver microsomes, recombinant CYPs, and human hepatocytes showed that 
lenalidomide is not a substrate of CYP enzymes. Lenalidomide is a weak substrate of P-gp, and is not a 
substrate of BCRP, MATE1, MRP1. MRP2, MRP3, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, organic cation 
transporter, novel type 1 and 2 (OCTN1, and OCTN2) based on in vitro studies. In a clinical study, no 
significant changes in lenalidomide PK were observed when coadministered with the P-gp inhibitor, 
quinidine; thereby, suggesting that P-gp mediated transport is not a significant contributor to 
lenalidomide clearance in the clinical setting. 
When ixazomib is administered together with dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy of 
oral contraceptives needs to be considered. Women using hormonal contraceptives should additionally 
use a barrier method of contraception. 
The inhibition of 20S proteasome activity in whole blood after once-weekly and twice-weekly IV bolus 
dosing in clinical studies indicated maximum activity within 30 minutes in most patients, a dose-
dependent profile and a reversible inhibition effect. 
Non clinical and clinical studies have excluded a potential effect of ixazomib in QTc. Clinical safety data 
showed a profile of increased gastro-intestinal toxicity with the triple combination, mainly nausea, 
vomiting and diarrhoea. Although peripheral neuropathy was also reported in clinical studies in 
common with other proteasome inhibitors, in the majority of cases was of low grade.  
Data from the pivotal study on exposure-effect using the proposed ixazomib oral weekly dosing at 4 
mg in combination with lenalidomide and dex showed consistent efficacy in terms of PFS and clinical 
response despite any potential variability in exposure. There is no data on exposure-effect using 
different doses of ixazomib. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology of ixazomib has been adequately investigated.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The selection for the Phase 3 dose and schedule of ixazomib was based on data from two phase 1 
single-agent studies (C16004 and C16003) and one phase 1/2 combination study with Lendex 
(C16005). 
Dose schedule (Studies C16004 and C16003) 
Studies C16003 and C16004 were phase 1, open-label, multi-centre (in US), dose-escalation studies 
evaluating the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and activity of single-agent oral ixazomib in 
adult patients with RRMM. The patients treated during the dose-escalation part had relapsed after 
receiving at least 2 prior lines of therapy that had to include some combination of bortezomib, 
immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), and corticosteroids. After determination of the MTD, additional 
patients were enrolled in 1 of 4 MTD expansion cohorts.  
The studies differed in dosing schedule: 
• 
C16004, ixazomib orally once weekly, Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle (the same ixazomib 
schedule used in pivotal study C16010).  
• 
C16003, ixazomib orally twice weekly, Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle.  
Dosing started in both studies at 0.24 mg/m2 BSA based on non-clinical studies and escalated to 
equivalent of 4 mg fixed dose in Study C16003:

1.5 mg  
2.2 mg

3.7 mg 
4 mg  
In C16004, dose escalation continued to 2.97 mg/m2 (~5.5 mg fixed dosing) and 3.95 mg/m2 (~7 mg 
fixed dose). The MTD was identified as 2.97 mg/m2 in C16004 and 2 mg/m2 (~ 3.7 mg fixed dosing) in 
C16003. 
Once the MTD was established, patients were enrolled into the 4 expansion cohorts on the basis of 
their disease status and prior therapy: Relapsed and Refractory (refractory to most recent therapy); 
PI-Naive (relapsed or refractory); Velcade-Relapsed (relapsed after previous bortezomib but were not 
refractory to it); Carfilzomib cohort (relapsed or refractory and previously exposed to carfilzomib). If a 
patient met the criteria for both the Relapsed and Refractory cohort and Velcade-Relapsed cohort, then 
the patient was enrolled in the Relapsed and Refractory MTD expansion cohort unless the cohort was 
full, in which case the patient was then enrolled in the Velcade-Relapsed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 68/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disease response was assessed by the investigators using the IMWG criteria with the addition of MR 
from the EBMT criteria. Response assessments were performed every other treatment cycle beginning 
with Cycle 3, Day 1. The efficacy analysis was based on the ORR (CR+PR) and CR+PR+MR rate. 
Patients discontinued treatment if they experienced PD or unacceptable toxicity. The maximum 
duration of treatment was 12 cycles unless it was determined that a patient would benefit from 
continued therapy. Patients were followed for 30 days after the last dose of ixazomib or until the start 
of subsequent antineoplastic therapy. 
Sixty patients were enrolled in each study and the expansion cohorts included 31 patients in C16004 
and 40 patients in C16003.  The median overall treatment duration in the safety population of C16004 
was 53.5 days (range, 1–324 days) and of C16003 was 70.5 days (range, 1–911 days). 
The phase 1 studies included heavily pre-treated patients representative of patients with RRMM for 
whom few treatment options remain. Ixazomib demonstrated activity among these patients. A 
heterogeneous group of 19 patients in the phase 1 studies responded to ixazomib treatment with at 
least MR, with 17 patients achieving a PR or better. The responders ranged in age from 51 to 83 years, 
they had between 2 and 12 prior lines of therapy, 4 patients had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, 
and 4 patients had ISS Stage III myeloma. Among the 19 responders, 11 patients were refractory to 
lenalidomide and 9 patients were refractory to PIs, 5 of whom were also refractory to lenalidomide.  
A summary of the results is presented in Table 25.

The response rates were similar between the 2 studies in whole study populations but MTD-expansion 
cohort had a higher ORR in C16004 than C16003 (27% vs 15%) and a similar median duration of 
response (PR or better) (5.6 months vs 5.7 months). 
DLTs included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and rash in C16004 and rash and thrombocytopenia 
(borderline) in C16003. The incidences of Grade 3 and Grade 4 TEAEs were lower in the overall 
population in C16004 than in C16003 (Grade 3, 62% vs 75%; Grade 4, 22% vs 38%). At the MTD, the 
incidences of Grade 3 TEAEs were similar in C16004 and C16003, but the incidence of Grade 4 TEAEs 
was lower in C16004 than in C16003 (35% vs 48%). Also incidence of dose modifications due to AEs

was lower in C16004 overall population (45% vs 60%) and in the MTD-expansion cohort (58% vs 
68%). Although the incidences of drug discontinuation due to AEs were similar in the overall C16004 
and C16003 populations, in the MTD-expansion cohorts, more patients experienced TEAEs that led to 
drug discontinuation in C16003 than in C16004 (20% vs 13%). 
In summary, in the MTD-expansion cohorts, the higher response rate and better tolerability with the 
once weekly ixazomib dose schedule supported selecting this schedule for phase 3 study. Additionally, 
once weekly ixazomib in a 28-day cycle combines seamlessly with the 28-day LenDex treatment cycle, 
without compromising the LenDex schedule and dose intensity. 
Dose in combination with Lendex (Study C16005) 
Study C16005 was an open-label, multicentre clinical trial evaluating ixazomib oral in combination with 
Lendex in patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM).  
The study consisted of a phase 1 dose-escalation part, to determine the MTD/RP2D of ixazomib in 
combination with Lendex and a phase 2, dose-expansion portion in which patients were treated at the 
RP2D.  
In both phases, all treatments were given orally in repeated 28-day cycles. The regimen consisted of: 
1) Induction (up to 12 cycles)  
Ixazomib once weekly for 3 weeks (Days 1, 8, and 15) + Dex 40 mg (Days 1, 8, 15, 22) + Len 25 mg 
(Days 1-21) 
Phase 1: ixazomib dose-escalation starting dose 1.68 mg/m2, MTD 2.97 mg/m2 m2(= 5.5 mg). 
Phase 2: ixazomib at RP2D, 4.0 mg fixed dose 
2) Maintenance (Cycle 13 and beyond) 
For patients with ≥ SD, continue on single-agent ixazomib once weekly for 3 weeks (Days 1, 8, 15) in 
28 day cycles at dose tolerated at end of induction phase.  
Treatment would continue until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Sixty five patients with NDMM (excluding 
those with ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy) were enrolled (15 in phase 1 and 50 in phase 2). The 
study is still ongoing. 
In phase 1, patients were dosed on the basis of their assigned cohort and received escalating (3+3 
scheme) BSA-based doses (1.68, 2.23, 2.97, and 3.95 mg/m2) of oral ixazomib. The MTD of once-
weekly ixazomib in combination with a 28-day cycle of LenDex was established at 2.97 mg/m2 (= 5.5 
mg fixed dose). However, the median dose intensity for lenalidomide was 84.6% and 96.0% for the 
2.97 mg/m2 (5.5 mg) and 2.23 mg/m2 (4 mg) doses, respectively. Among 3 patients treated at 2.23 
mg/m2 (4 mg), the outcome included two CR and one PR. Among the 6 patients treated at 2.95 mg/m2 
(5.5 mg) two achieved CR (including 1 sCR), three VGPR, and one PR. 
The phase 2 portion began after determination of the MTD and evaluation of the safety at the MTD in 
at least 6 patients. The RP2D in this study was established as 2.23 mg/m2 (=fixed dose of 4 mg). 
As the once-weekly 4 mg dose of ixazomib in 28 day cycles, in combination with standard doses of 
LenDex was well tolerated and achieved an overall response rate of 90% it was chosen as the ixazomib 
dose to be given in combination with LenDex in the phase 3 study.

Treatments 
Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive oral [ixazomib+LenDex] or [placebo+LenDex] at home in 
28-days cycles until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first: 
 
 
Ixazomib 4 mg or matching placebo capsule on Days 1, 8, and 15  
Lenalidomide 25 mg on Days 1 through 21  
  Dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 
Patients with a low creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min (or ≤50 mL/min, according to lenalidomide 
prescribing information/local practice) received a reduced lenalidomide dose of 10 mg once daily on 
Days 1 -21 but could be increased to 15 mg after 2 cycles if the patient was not responding to 
treatment and was able to tolerate it. If renal function normalized and the patient continued to tolerate 
this treatment, lenalidomide could be escalated to 25 mg. 
Dose modifications of 1 or multiple agents were made based on toxicities and followed pre-specified 
criteria. 
Concomitant medications allowed included myeloid growth factors, erythropoietin (use to be minimized 
due to potential risk of DVT when given concurrently with lenalidomide), digoxin and bisphosphonates. 
Palliative radiotherapy for pain control of a pre-existing lesion could be allowed after discussion with 
clinician. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the addition of oral ixazomib to the 
background therapy of lenalidomide and dexamethasone improves PFS in patients with RRMM. 
Key secondary objectives included the evaluation of overall survival (OS) and the OS in high-risk 
patients carrying deletion del (17).  
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 72/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other secondary objectives included the evaluation of: Overall response rate (ORR), including partial 
response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), and complete response (CR); CR+VGPR; Duration 
of response (DOR); time to progression (TTP); safety of the addition of ixazomib to lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone; pain response rate, as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form (BPI-SF) and 
analgesic use; change in global health status, functioning, and symptoms as measured by the patient-
reported outcome (PRO) instrument European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and MY-20 module; PFS and OS in high-risk 
cytogenetic patient groups such as translocations t(4;14), t(14;16), +1q, del(13), or del(17); potential 
relationship between response or resistance to ixazomib treatment and proteasome and NF-kB-related 
genes, such as tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF-3), in blood samples and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses (collection of PK data).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date 
of first documentation of disease progression, based on central laboratory results and IMWG criteria, or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death; 
Overall survival within the high-risk patients carrying del(17) subgroup (patients reported as positive 
for del(17) by the central laboratory combined with those cases that lacked a central laboratory result 
and were reported positive by the local laboratory) was defined the same as OS in the ITT population; 
Overall response rate (ORR): defined as the proportion of ITT patients who achieved PR or better;  
Complete Response (CR) and Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) rate; 
Duration of response (DOR): measured as the time from the date of first documentation of response to 
the date of first documented progression; 
Time to progression (TTP): measured as the time from randomization to the date of first documented 
progression.  
Pain response rate, measured by the proportion of pain responders, pain response was defined as the 
occurrence of a 30% reduction from baseline in BPI-SF worst pain score over the last 24 hours without 
an increase in analgesic use at 2 consecutive evaluations. Pain response rate was analyzed in patients 
in the ITT population with a baseline pain score ≥ 4. 
Comparison of change in global health status between baseline and each post-baseline assessment, as 
measured by the global health scale, functioning, and symptoms of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and MY-20; 
OS and PFS in high-risk population carrying del(17), t(4;14), or t(14;16); 
Association between response or resistance to Ixazomib treatment and proteasome and NFKB-related 
genes, such as TRAF-3, or circulating proteasome levels; 
Association between response or resistance to Ixazomib treatment and mutations in key pathways, 
such as RAS/RAF and PI3K; 
Plasma concentration-time data to contribute to future population PK analysis.

Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the secondary endpoint of OS. Approximately 703 patients 
were planned to be enrolled based on a calculation on OS with a 2-sided test at the significance level of 
α=0.05, power of 80%, assuming median OS in the control of 30 months versus experimental arm of 
39 months (HR 0.77), and around 10% dropout rate. The final analysis of OS was estimated to occur 
approximately 80 months from the enrolment of first patient. With an observed HR of 0.833 (e.g., 
median OS of 30 months for control vs 36 months for treatment, 20% improvement), statistical 
significance could be claimed at the final analysis with 486 death events.  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of the 2 treatment arms: ixazomib or matching placebo 
capsules in combination with LenDex.  
Patients were stratified by: 1 versus 2 or 3 prior therapies; PI-exposed versus PI-naïve and ISS Stage 
at screening of I or II versus III. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double blind study. 
Statistical methods 
The analysis of the primary endpoint, PFS, was based on the ITT population using IRC-assessed 
progression data. PFS was to be analyzed when 262 and 365 PFS events had occurred for the first 
interim analysis and second interim analysis, respectively. A 2-sided, stratified log-rank test was to be 
used to compare the treatment groups with respect to PFS at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.0163 and 
0.0337 for the first and the second interim analysis, which corresponded to a nominal p value of 
0.0451 based on O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundary (the Lan-DeMets method). In addition, an 
unadjusted stratified Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% CIs for the 
treatment effect using the stratification factors. The Kaplan Meier (K-M) survival curves and K-M 
medians (if estimable), along with their 2-sided 95% CIs, were also provided for each treatment 
group. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint, PFS, included: PFS assessed by investigator in the ITT 
population, PFS assessed by IRC in the PP population, PFS assessed by IRC using different censoring 
mechanisms in the ITT population based on both FDA and EMA guidance (for example, not censoring 
for patients who discontinued treatment and underwent transplant or received alternative neoplastic 
therapy). Furthermore, a stepwise Cox model was implemented to identify potential predictive factors 
using relevant demographic or diagnostic covariates, with the entry level fixed at 0.25 and a stay level 
fixed at 0.10. In addition to treatment and stratification factors, the model may have included, but was 
not limited to, the following prognostic factors: age; race (white; non-white); prior therapy (IMiD-
exposed vs IMiD-naïve); baseline ECOG score; cytogenetic test (high risk vs normal); and corrected 
serum calcium. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for PFS relative to baseline stratification factors, demographic data 
such as sex, race and age, and disease characteristics such as type of prior regimen. 
Analysis Populations 
Four different patient populations were defined. 
- Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population: defined as all patients who were randomized. Patients were 
analysed according to the treatment they were randomized to receive, regardless of any errors of 
dosing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 74/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Safety population: defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of any study drug. Patients 
were analysed according to the treatment actually received.  
 - Response-Evaluable population: defined as patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had 
measurable disease at baseline, and had at least 1 post-baseline response assessment. 
- Per-Protocol (PP) population: defined as patients who did not violate the terms of the protocol in a 
way that would affect the study outcome significantly, as determined by the study clinician, who was 
blinded to study drug assignment. All decisions to exclude patients from the PP population were made 
before the unblinding of the study.

Recruitment 
Between 28 August 2012 and 27 May 2014, a total of 722 patients were randomized at 147 study 
centres in 26 countries. A total of 224 patients were from Western countries (North America and West 
Europe) and 498 patients were from non-Western countries. The countries with the largest number of 
patients were France (11%), New Zealand (9%) and the US (7%). By region, 483 patients (67%) were

enrolled from 91 sites in Europe, 143 (20%) from 35 sites in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, and 96 
(13%) from 21 sites in North America (NA).  
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was finalized on 21 February 2012 and was followed by Amendment 1 (14 
September 2012), Amendment 2 (China only), Amendment 3 (8 July 2014), and Amendment 4 (China 
only).  
One hundred thirty-eight patients were enrolled under the original protocol and 584 patients under 
Amendment 1. An update of the IMWG response criteria version from 2006 to 2011 was part of the 
amendment 1. 
Amendment 3 included an update of the statistical analyses to include the assumptions on PFS for 
sample size calculation and additional interim analysis, and also to remove the non-inferential test on 
PFS at the original planned second interim analysis. This amendment was in place prior to the first 
interim analysis and prior to breaking the treatment blind to the internal submission working team; no 
changes were made to the statistical analysis plan after unblinding. 
As the definition of high-risk abnormalities for MM evolved on the basis of new data, the cytogenetic 
abnormalities of del(13) and +1q were no longer considered to be high-risk abnormalities and were 
excluded from the high-risk evaluations in the final SAP.

a Prior therapies were defined per Rajkumar et al. 2011; may not exactly match the stratification factor 
(lines of prior therapy: 1 versus 2 or 3). 
b Relapsed was defined as patients who relapsed from at least 1 previous treatment (>60 days after the last 
dose of treatment) but were not refractory to any previous treatment. 
c Refractory was defined as patients who had disease progression on treatment or progression within 60 days 
after the last dose of at least 1 previous treatment but were not relapsed to any previous treatment; patients 
who were refractory to lenalidomide or proteasome inhibitor-based therapy were to be excluded. 
d Refractory and relapsed was defined as patients who relapsed from at least 1 previous treatment and 
additionally were refractory to at least 1 previous treatment. 
e Note that blinded medical review of patients refractory to any prior PI or IMID therapy was also done  
and classified fewer patients as refractory. 
f Primary refractory patients were those with PD or SD as best response (never responded) across all lines ofprior 
therapy. Patients with both PD and SD were counted in the PD category.

c  The central laboratory normal reference ranges are as follows: corrected calcium, 
2.125–2.65 mmol/L (8.5-10.6 mg/dL); creatinine, 0.76-1.27 mg/dL; hemoglobin, 
females: 115-150 g/L and males: 125-170 g/L; and creatinine clearance, 
100-130 mL/min/1.73 m2. Creatinine clearance is calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula: C  [140–Age(years)]  Weight (kg)/[72  serum creatinine (mg/dL)], where 
multiplication factor C=1 for males, and C=0.85 for females. Corrected calcium 
(mmol/L) is calculated using the following formula: serum calcium (mmol/L)+0.0246  
[40–serum albumin (g/L)].

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Progression free survival 
The outcome of the first interim analysis was reviewed by the IDMC on 5 February 2015 (data cut-off 
30 October 2014 with 286 IRC-assessed events).  
Table 32. Analysis of Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on IRC assessment ITT 
Population (cut-off 30 October 2014) 
NE = Not Estimable. NA: Kaplan Meier estimate not available due to no events in the interval. Censored 
observations are denoted by *. Only non-missing censoring categories are summarized in the table. a Based on 
Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates [n = number of subjects at risk]. b Hazard ratio is based on a stratified Cox’s 
proportional hazard regression model with stratification factors: prior therapies (1, 2 or 3), proteasome inhibitor 
(exposed, naïve), and ISS Stage at Screening (1 or 2, 3) with treatment as a factor in the model. A less than 1 
hazard ratio for treatment indicates better prevention of progression or death in Ixazomib + Lenalidomide and 
Dexamethosone arm as compared to Lenalidomide and Dexamethosone alone. c P-value tests the hypothesis of 
equal event times in both treatment arms obtained using the Log-rank test stratified by prior therapies (1, 2 or 3), 
proteasome inhibitor (exposed, naïve), and ISS Stage at Screening (1 or 2, 3).

Median DOR was 20.5 months in ixazomib vs 15.0 months in placebo arm.  
Secondary endpoint: Pain response 
Among patients with a baseline worst pain score of ≥4 (n=356), 99 of 184 ixazomib regimen patients 
(54%) and 86 of 172 (50%) placebo regimen patients achieved a pain response (p=0.3909); the 
median time to pain response was shorter in ixazomib arm.

Table 38. Analysis of Time to Pain Response in Subjects with Baseline Worst Pain Score >=4 
TT Population (Study C16010) 
Censored observations are denoted by *. Only non-missing censoring categories are summarized in the table. 
a Time to pain response is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented pain response. 
b Hazard ratio is based on a stratified Cox's proportional hazard regression model with stratification factors: prior 
therapies (1, 2 or 3), proteasome inhibitor (exposed, naïve), and ISS Stage at Screening (1 or 2, 3) with treatment 
as 
a factor in the model. A greater than 1 hazard ratio for treatment indicates better time to pain response in Ixazomib 
+ Lenalidomide and Dexamethosone arm as compared to Lenalidomide and Dexamethosone alone. 
c P-value tests the hypothesis of equal event times in both treatment arms obtained using the Log-rank test 
stratified 
by prior therapies (1, 2 or 3), proteasome inhibitor (exposed, naïve), and ISS Stage at Screening (1 or 2, 3). 
d Probability of being event-free based on Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates [n=number of subjects at risk] 
Exploratory endpoints 
Quality-of-Life Assessments 
Global health scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 over time were consistently similar in the 2 treatment 
regimens. There was a trend for better physical functioning, emotional functioning, and fatigue scores 
for the ixazomib regimen. Results of the MY-20 were also generally similar in the 2 treatment 
regimens, including the results of the subscale measuring side effects of treatment (Figure12, Figure 
15).

Efficacy in patients with high risk cytogenetics 
A total of 137 patients (75 ixazomib/62 placebo) had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and efficacy 
was assessed in the following subgroups: 
 
 
 
 
overall high-risk: patients with del(17), t(4;14), and t(14;16) combined 
del(17) positive (n=69): patients with del(17) alone (n=51) or in combination with either or 
both of the translocations t(4;14) and t(14;16) (n=18)  
t(4;14) translocation alone (n=61)  
t(14;16) translocation alone (n=7)A consistent treatment effect was observed across the high-
risk subgroups for the ixazomib regimen and it was similar to the ixazomib effect seen in 
patients without high-risk cytogenetics.  
A summary of response to treatment, PFS, and TTP for the overall study population, patients with 
high-risk cytogenetics, and patients without high-risk cytogenetics is presented in Table 41 (cut-off 30 
October 2014).

Western Countries 
Compared with the placebo, the ixazomib regimen showed superior activity over placebo in patients in 
Western countries (median PFS 26.9 months vs 17.7 months, HR 0.672) and non-Western countries 
(median PFS 18.7 months vs 14.9 months, HR 0.868) (data not shown).  
Japan 
As of 30 October 2014, 286 patients in the global ITT population had a PFS event but only 4 patients 
were from Japan. As of the 12 July 2015 cut-off, 86 new PFS events occurred in the global ITT 
population since 30 October 2014 and 15 events (17%) occurred in patients from Japan (7 patients 
ixazomib/ 8 patients placebo). 
Median PFS in the ixazomib regimen was less than that in the placebo among patients in Japan (17.0 
vs 18.7 months; HR=1.327). In the study population excluding patients from Japan (“non-Japan”), the 
median PFS in the ixazomib and placebo regimens was 20.0 months and 15.6 months, respectively 
(HR=0.809), similar to the overall results at the primary PFS analysis in the ITT population (median 
PFS in ixazomib and placebo regimens: 20.6 and 14.7 months, respectively; HR=0.742).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was based on a single phase 
3 study C16010. The study is considered of adequate design, placebo controlled and with appropriate 
clinical endpoints for the target indication in MM (primary endpoint PFS and OS as key secondary). 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 99/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The patient inclusion/exclusion criteria reflect the target population of MM patients that have received 
at least one prior therapy. Excluding patients that are refractory to lenalidomide or proteasome 
inhibitors is acceptable. 
The design of the study follows previous CHMP Scientific Advice except for the planned interim 
analyses that was not recommended in an application with a single pivotal study. The significance level 
planned for the interim analysis (p<0.0163) is not sufficiently high to replicate the evidence level 
which would be seen from two trials positive at p<0.05. 
Additional data from two phase 1 studies that administered single agent ixazomib in a more heavily 
pre-treated MM population have been presented to further support the efficacy of ixazomib in RRMM 
and for justification of dose selected. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the pivotal study the primary endpoint PFS was met at the first planned interim analysis and its 
effect was initially considered clinically significant in the context of the disease and current available 
therapies. A median increase of 6 months with ixazomib regimen versus control is significant (PFS 
median 20.6 m vs 14.7 m; HR 0.742 [0.587, 0.939], p= 0.012), especially when compared with other 
available therapies. All the pre-specified sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint were considered 
adequate. 
The favourable PFS result was supported by positive results for secondary endpoints, including 
subgroup analysis and results in patients with high risk cytogenetics at the first analysis.  
However the updated efficacy data on second interim analysis (data cut off July 2015) showed a 
reduced difference in effect between arms in the overall ITT population for PFS, RRs and TTP compared 
to previous analysis. A hazard ratio for PFS of 0.818 (0.666, 1.004), p=0.054 for the updated analysis 
is far short of the evidence required in an application with a single pivotal trial. The worsening of 
results between the initially submitted analysis and the updated analysis is also a concern, and 
suggests the data may not yet have reached maturity, and could possibly worsen further with 
extended follow-up. It is clear that if this second analysis had been the primary analysis for PFS the 
study would have failed. When EMA censoring rules were used, the hazard ratio for the updated 
analysis was greater still at 0.822 (0.68, 1.0). These analyses represent the most recently information 
we have on PFS and have to be taken into consideration. A p-value of 0.054 clearly does not represent 
the level of evidence that would be expected from a single pivotal trial. 
The OS data is still not mature and at the updated analysis the HR was 0.868 (0.064, 1.17). 
Following PFS and OS, the next endpoint in the pre-specified testing hierarchy was OS in High-Risk 
Patients with del(17). Though technically this should not be looked at, as OS in the overall population 
is not positive with a hazard ratio of 0.487. A similar result was seen in the analysis of OS in all high 
risk subjects (subjects carrying: del(17), translocation t(4;14) or t(14;16)) HR=0.576 (0.289, 1.149, 
p=0.113). The result for PFS in high risk subjects was HR=0.625 (0.40, 0.98) and a p value =0.037 
but it is noted for the previous analysis cut-off, that the result was HR 0.543 (0.321, 0.918, p=0.021). 
The benefit of ixazomib seems greater in this sub-group than in the overall population though there is 
still great uncertainty over the true effect on PFS and OS. 
The better outcome in placebo arm in the Japan region is surprising and adds uncertainty to the 
outcome in the global population. It is noted that Japanese patients represented a younger population 
with most of them having the disease at earlier stages. In all, it suggests as if ixazomib exerts more 
activity in patients with poor prognosis. Regional effects may have contributed to the difference in PFS 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 100/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between the first and second analysis, potentially because of some underlying differences in the 
patient populations. As compared to ITT population, Japan patients were younger (<65 years old: 59% 
vs 48%), more ISS stage I (78% vs 64%), more IMID naïve (78% vs 45%), and had more dose 
modifications during the study. 
Time to next treatment data may have been helpful in further defining the real clinical benefit of 
treatment with ixazomib, however the data is still not mature. 
An exploratory analysis in the subgroup of patients who received prior transplant was conducted and it 
is considered relevant in an early relapsed/refractory MM setting, when transplant is still an option. It 
is noted more than half of patients in the study had received prior SCT (199/362 in placebo and 
212/360 in ixazomib arm), but the results in this subgroup of patients at the data cut-off October 2014 
are of concern with a median PFS 20.6 months in the ixazomib arm versus 18.3 months in the placebo 
arm (HR 0.988) and provide uncertainty to the beneficial effect of adding ixazomib to lendex.  
Analyses regarding prior transplant from the updated cut-off date of July 2015 in the ITT population, 
an approximate 7.6 month median PFS advantage (hazard ratio [HR]= 0.674; p=0.014) was observed 
with ixazomib in patients who had not received a prior SCT supported by data on TTP (HR 0.649, 
p=0.01) and ORR (78% vs 68% in the I+Ld and P+Ld groups respectively).  However in subjects who 
received prior SCT, the observed clinical benefit in terms of median PFS (19.6 vs 18.8 months in the 
I+Ld and P+Ld groups respectively, HR=0.977), median TTP (HR 0.951) and ORR (~3%) is 
significantly reduced. A similar scenario is also observed with respect to the subpopulations with high 
risk cytogenetics. 
There is lack of data on the feasibility of stem cell mobilization after exposure to ixazomib plus LenDex. 
Moreover, although it is reported that 4 patients discontinued ixazomib to receive stem cell transplant, 
no post-transplant outcome in patients treated with ixazomib was available.   
The regional differences between western and non-western countries are notable and add further 
uncertainty especially in an application based on a single pivotal study.  
Although no improvement in the quality of life, including pain response, was observed, the addition of 
ixazomib to the LenDex was not associated with a decrease in QoL scores. The latter observation is 
considered relevant, since tolerability is usually one of the main issues with triple-drug combinations in 
relapsed MM. 
The data from China continuation study is difficult to interpret as the patient population were of a more 
advanced disease stage and unfortunately cytogenetics was not investigated. In all, it adds no 
significant support for this application. 
Attempts were made to identify a higher-risk subgroup that may benefit from treatment with ixazomib.  
The subgroup of patients called as the adverse risk subpopulation defined as the patients who received 
at least one prior therapy and have adverse risk characteristics, or who received at least two prior 
therapies reported a median PFS benefit of 6.2 months: 18.4 months in the ixazomib regimen versus 
12.2 months in the placebo regimen at the primary analysis (HR= 0.700 [p=0.009]), and at the 
updated analysis a median PFS benefit of 6 months (18.9 months vs 12.9 months; HR=0.745 
[p=0.015]). However the terminology of adverse risk characteristics is considered too broad and 
ambiguous and data in other subgroups with adverse risk characteristics (i.e. ECOG PS, >75 years of 
age, creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min etc) did not show benefit of ixazomib and raises concerns 
regarding the robustness of the decision based on with the risk of “cherry picking” in post-hoc analysis. 
In addition, restriction by prior lines of therapy may not be ideal in MM, due to the high heterogeneity 
of prior treatments.

Based on this, the applicant revised the indication to include adult patients with multiple myeloma who 
have experienced at least one relapse with ISS stage III disease or elevated-risk cytogenetics [del(17), 
t(4;14), t(14;16), or 1q21+]; or experienced at least 2 relapses. However the CHMP concluded that 
the evidence of efficacy in the proposed indication is considered insufficient. The data are currently 
immature, especially for overall survival which is not yet evaluable. There is still the risk of “cherry 
picking” (i.e. the HR for PFS in del(17) patients was 0.596 in the primary analysis and 0.821 in the 
secondary analysis). Point estimates for efficacy measures are not sufficiently outstanding in the 
context of other available treatment options to compensate for the limitations of the available data. 
There is a lack of clinical rationale for post hoc arguments that efficacy is greater in the proposed 
population. The proposed high risk classification to identify eligible patients is not usually employed in 
clinical practice, and has not been validated in other studies. 
There is substantial uncertainty associated with the interpretation of post hoc subgroup analyses, 
including a number of inconsistencies in the data regarding risk factors for early progression.  Analyses 
in these subgroups were not statistically compelling and differences from the overall ITT population are 
considered likely to be chance findings. The changes between the analyses and the implications for 
data maturity (added to the general problems with post-hoc sub-group analyses) suggest that it is 
difficult to be confident in any positive sub-group results based on the current data-set. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is not considered sufficiently 
demonstrated to support a positive benefit/risk balance in the proposed indication. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data have been collected in 1622 patients enrolled in ixazomib clinical trials. 
For the purpose of this application discussions and comparisons are focused on data from two 
analyses: 
 
Pivotal placebo-controlled trial (C16010; N=720) 
  Overall safety population (all patients who received at least 1 dose of oral ixazomib [either as a 
single agent or in combination with other agents, regardless of patient population] in 15 studies 
(Studies C16003, C16004, C16005, C16006, C16007, C16008, C16009, C16010, C16011, C16013, 
C16015, C16017, C16018, C16020, and TB MC010034 [N=990]). Of note, it includes 360 patients 
from the pivotal study. The majority of patients had MM (80%), 51% of patients were enrolled in 
North America and 33% in Europe. 
In addition, exposure data and an overall summary of AEs are also presented for all RRMM and NDMM 
patients who received at least 1 dose of oral ixazomib 4 mg on the weekly schedule +LenDex [Studies 
C16005 (phase 2 only), C16010, C16013, and TB MC010034 (combination agent cohort); N=460]).

Includes patients who received 4 mg dose of oral ixazomib+LenDex once weekly, from Studies C16005 (phase 2 only),

b  Studies C16003, C16004, C16005, C16006, C16007, C16008, C16009, C16010, C16011, C16013, C16015, C16017, C16018, 
C16020, and TB-MC010034. 
c  A treatment cycle is defined as a cycle in which the patient received any amount of ixazomib or placebo, lenalidomide, or 
dexamethasone. 
d  Relative dose intensity is defined as: 100 * (Total amount of dose taken) / (Total prescribed dose of treated cycles), where 
total prescribed dose equals [dose prescribed at enrollment * number of prescribed doses per cycle * the number of treated 
cycles]. 
The pivotal study data showed the ixazomib arm was given over a median number of 12 cycles (max 
26 = ~ 2 years), median relative dose intensity of ixazomib was high (97.4%) and the median relative 
dose intensity of lenalidomide and dexamethasone was similar in both arms. Ixazomib or placebo had 
the highest relative dose intensity and the lowest frequency of dose reductions. Up to 80% patients in 
the ixazomib arm did not have dose reduction, with 20% of patients having ≥1 ixazomib reduction and 
only 3% having 2 ixazomib reductions. The longest duration of exposure to ixazomib was reported in 
the overall safety analysis with 69 cycles (approximately 4 years). 
Concomitant medications 
Antithrombotic prophylaxis was required in studies including lenalidomide given the risk of 
thromboembolism. Other supportive care, eg, antiemetics, colony-stimulating factors, herpes zoster 
prophylaxis, and bisphosphonates were given at the physician’s discretion. 
In the pivotal study 97% patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis, the majority receiving aspirin 
(77%) and some patients were administered enoxaparin (24%) or nadroparin (9%) in a balanced 
manner in the two arms. Some differences between the ixazomib and placebo regimens, such as use of

antidiabetic medication (6% and 13%, respectively), were associated with baseline differences in 
medical history (eg, diabetes mellitus; 1 patient [<1%] and 7 patients [2%], respectively) rather than 
differences due to an effect of the treatment regimens themselves. A higher proportion of patients in 
the ixazomib regimen than placebo used antihistamines for systemic use (27% and 19%, 
respectively).

(a) TEAE assessed by the investigator as related to any drug in the drug combination (placebo, ixazomib, 
lenalidomide, or dexamethasone) was considered to be treatment related. 
AEs of any grade (regardless of causality) with a difference of at least 5% between the ixazomib and 
placebo arms included diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, peripheral oedema, vomiting, 
thrombocytopenia, and maculopapular rash (more frequent with ixazomib arm), as well as insomnia, 
muscle spasm, and pyrexia(more frequent with placebo arm). Other AE that appear to have at least 
5% difference between the two arms of pivotal study were due to rounding of events. Maculopapular 
rash was reported by 9% patients in ixazomib arm (vs 4% placebo) in the pivotal study. 
In the pivotal study 20% of patients in ixazomib arm had at least one dose reduction of ixazomib but 
only 3% had 2 ixazomib reductions. The primary causes of dose reductions of ixazomib were 
thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, rash and neutropenia. Dose reduction of lenalidomide was 
more frequent in ixazomib arm (38% vs 28%) than placebo mainly due to thrombocytopenia, 
diarrhoea, renal failure, rash and neutropaenia. Similar frequency of dexamethasone dose reduction 
was seen in ixazomib and placebo arms (31% vs 27%), mainly due to insomnia, mood altered, 
peripheral oedema and diarrhoea. 
AE Grade 3 or 4 
Grade 3 AE occurred in 49% of patients in the ixazomib arm and 43% of patients in the placebo 
(C16010). Grade 3 TEAEs reported by ≥5% of patients in either the ixazomib or placebo regardless of 
causality were neutropenia (15% and 12%, respectively), anaemia (9% and 13%), thrombocytopenia 
(8% and 3%), diarrhoea (6% and 2%), and pneumonia (6% and 7%). The only Grade 3 with a 
regimen difference ≥5 % was thrombocytopenia.

a  A patient reporting the same event more than once had that event counted only once within each preferred term 
using the highest intensity. 
b  Per CTCAE Version 4.03, syncope has only 1 grade, which is Grade 3. 
Grade 4 AE occurred in 15% of patients in the ixazomib regimen and 14% of patients in the placebo. 
No Grade 4 AE had a regimen difference ≥5%. Grade 4 TEAEs experienced by >1% in either the 
ixazomib or placebo regimen were thrombocytopenia (6% and 2%, respectively), neutropenia (4% 
each), and hypokalaemia (2% and <1%). 
The incidence in the overall safety analysis population of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs was similar to that of the 
ixazomib regimen in C16010.

Other AE of significance 
Thromboembolism 
In C16010, 96% of the ixazomib and 98% of the placebo received thromboprophylaxis as per protocol. 
The addition of ixazomib to LenDex did not increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (ixazomib 
and placebo regimens of 7% vs 10%, respectively). 
Herpes zoster 
Antiviral prophylaxis was allowed at the physician’s discretion. Herpes zoster reports were low (4% 
ixazomib regimen vs 2% placebo). In 3 patients (2 ixazomib, 1 placebo) were of Grade 3 and no 
patient had a Grade 4. The incidence among patients taking antiviral prophylactically was lower (0.4% 
each arm) than among the 236 patients (both arms) not taking prophylaxis with 18 (8%) reporting 
herpes zoster (13 of 113 patients (12%) in the ixazomib regimen vs 5 of 123 patients (4%) in the 
placebo). 
New primary malignancies 
No safety concern has been identified with regards to new primary malignancies in Study C16010 or 
the overall safety analysis population. The incidence was low, the same between the overall safety 
Assessment report

analysis population and the ixazomib regimen in Study C16010 (2%) and consistent with the reported 
incidence in patients with RRMM treated with lenalidomide/dexamethasone. 
Cardiac 
In study C16010 the incidence of heart failure was 4% in the ixazomib regimen vs 5% in placebo and 
the incidence of myocardial infarction was 1% and 2% respectively. The incidence of cardiac 
arrhythmias was 16% in the ixazomib regimen vs 15% in placebo . No patient in the clinical program 
experienced Torsade de pointes. Most of the arrhythmias were of low grade. 
Rash 
Rash occurred in 36% of patients in the NINLARO regimen compared to 23% of patients in the placebo 
regimen. The most common type of rash reported in both regimens was maculo papular and macular 
rash. Grade 3 rash was reported in 3% of patients in the NINLARO regimen compared to 1% of 
patients in the placebo regimen. Rash resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the three medicinal 
products in < 1% of patients in both regimens. 
The incidence of Rash (pooled PT) was highest during the first 3 months and generally declined over 
time. 
A higher proportion of patients in the ixazomib regimen used antihistamines (15% vs 9%) or 
corticosteroids (5% vs 3%) for systemic use for a rash event. 
In the overall safety analysis population, the incidence of rash reported as SAE was <1% (9 patients), 
including 2 patients (<1%) with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (1 of which codes to bullous erythema 
multiforme according to the current MedDRA version 18.0) and 1 patient (<1%) each with 
maculopapular rash, macular rash, rash generalized, rash morbilliform, erythema multiforme, acute 
febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, and interstitial granulomatous dermatitis. Overall, 6 patients (<1%) 
discontinued treatment due to macula-papular rash (2), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (1), acute febrile 
neutrophilic dermatosis (1), popular rash (1) and pruritic rash (1). 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Although there was a higher frequency in the ixazomib regimen than in the placebo of nausea (26% vs 
21%) and vomiting (22% vs 11%) in Study C16010, nausea or vomiting did not result in drug 
discontinuation. 
A higher incidence of diarrhoea was noted in the ixazomib regimen than in the placebo regimen (42% 
and 36%, respectively) in Study C16010. 
Diarrhoea resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the three medicinal products in 1% of patients 
in the ninlaro regimen and < 1% of patients in the placebo regimen. 
Thrombocytopaenia 
In Study C16010, three percent of patients in the ixazomib regimen and 1% of patients in the placebo 
regimen had a platelet count ≤ 10,000/mm3 during treatment. Less than 1% of patients in both 
regimens had a platelet count ≤ 5000/mm3 during treatment. Thrombocytopenia resulted in 
discontinuation of one or more of the three drugs in < 1% of patients in the NINLARO regimen and 2% 
of patients in the placebo regimen. Thrombocytopenia did not result in an increase in haemorrhagic 
events or platelet transfusions.

Peripheral neuropathy 
Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 28% of patients in the ixazomib regimen compared to 21% of 
patients in the placebo regimen. Grade 3 adverse reactions of peripheral neuropathy were reported at 
2% in both regimens. The most commonly reported reaction was peripheral sensory neuropathy (19% 
and 14% in the NINLARO and placebo regimen, respectively). Peripheral motor neuropathy was not 
commonly reported in either regimen (< 1%). Peripheral neuropathy resulted in discontinuation of one 
or more of the three drugs in 1% of patients in both regimens. 
Other 
The overall safety analysis have reported infrequent incidences of tumor lysis syndrome (<1%), 1 
report of SAE of transverse myelitis with ixazomib not well characterised, and 1 report of SAE of 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (oral ixazomib 5.5 mg) with recovery. 
Long-term AE 
In the ixazomib regimen of the pivotal study, the incidence of most categories of TEAEs declined with 
continued exposure, except for TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation of at least 1 of the 3 drugs which 
occurred most frequently in Cycles 13-18. Similar patterns were noted in the placebo regimen and 
indicate that the ixazomib regimen was tolerated with prolonged treatment. A similar profile of 
decreased incidence of AE over time was observed for the overall safety population. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse event  
In Study C16010, SAEs occurred in 40% of patients in the ixazomib regimen and 44% of patients in 
the placebo. The most common SAE was pneumonia (6% ixazomib vs 8% placebo). There were no 
SAEs or SAEs related to study drug with a difference ≥5 % between the two regimens. Also the most 
common drug related SAEs was pneumonia (3% ixazomib vs 5% placebo).  The incidence was similar 
in the overall safety analysis population. A summary of SAE is shown in Table 54.

Deaths 
A total of 29 on-study deaths (within 30 days of the last dose of study drug) were reported in Study 
C16010 (database lock on 30 October 2014); 12 (3%) in the ixazomib regimen and 17 (5%) in the 
placebo. Deaths were more frequently documented in early cycles of therapy although some occurred 
up to cycle 21.  
Over one-fourth (8/29; 28%) of on-study deaths were attributed to disease progression. 
Twelve deaths (6 in each arm) were associated with cardiovascular events, 5 with infections (2 
ixazomib / 3 placebo) and 4 were associated with other organ failure. 
Five of 29 deaths were related to study drug treatment; 3 in the ixazomib regimen (pulmonary 
embolism, fungal pneumonia, and coma with concurrent stroke) and 2 in the placebo (myocardial 
infarction and pulmonary embolism). 
The incidence of on-study deaths in the overall safety analysis population (4% /41 patients) was 
similar to that of the ixazomib regimen in C16010, also decreased over time and most (18 deaths or 
44%) were due to progressive disease. Five of 41 deaths (3 in ixazomib regimen) were considered 
related to the study drug regimen (respiratory syncytial viral pneumonia, cardiorespiratory arrest, 
coma with concurrent stroke, pulmonary embolism, and fungal pneumonia). There were 30 (3%) 
deaths within 90 days of the first dose of study drug and the most common cause was plasma cell 
myeloma (6 patients).

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
The percentage of patients in the pivotal study with a Grade 0, 1, or 2 haemoglobin or neutrophil value 
at baseline who shifted to a worst value of Grade 3 or 4 was similar between the ixazomib and placebo 
arms. A difference was noted for platelet count with a higher incidence of grade 3 and 4 
thrombocytopaenia in the ixazomib arm. The data from the overall safety population is similar to the 
ixazomib regimen in the pivotal study.

Hepatotoxicity has been reported with the use of lenalidomide. Four patients out of whom 2 were from 
the pivotal study (1 ixazomib, 1 placebo) met the biochemical criteria for potential Hy’s law.   
In Study C16010, mean changes in liver function parameters were for the majority generally small and 
similar between arms.  TEAE associated with liver impairment between ixazomib and placebo were 6% 
vs 5% respectively with shifts to grade 3 or 4  1% in both arms.  
Data from overall safety analysis population was similar to that reported for the ixazomib arm in the 
pivotal study. 
Renal 
There were no safety concerns with respect to renal impairment in the pivotal study, with a similar 
incidence in ixazomib and placebo arms (8% vs 10%), and shifts to grade 3 or 4 creatinine values 
below 2% in both arms. 
Data from overall safety analysis population was similar to that reported for the izxazomib arm in the 
pivotal study.

Safety in special populations 
Age 
In the pivotal study the incidence of SAEs and on study death was similar across age groups. The 
incidence of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, and TEAEs, in particular thrombocytopaenia, resulting in study 
drug regimen dose modification, dose reduction, or discontinuation tended to increase with baseline 
age but was observed for both regimens. No particular safety concerns were observed for the small 
group of 10 patients ≥ 85 years.

It should be noted some of these AE were due to disease progression that was captured according to 
the protocol as TEAE leading to discontinuation. 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 1 or more agents occurring in ≥1% patients in either arm (but not 
> 2%) were asthenic conditions, heart failure, peripheral neuropathies, diarrhoea (excluding infective) 
and sleep disturbances.  
The most frequent causes of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of full study regimen were 
haematological (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, decreased appetite), 
general (asthenia, fatigue), neuropathy, and infections. 
The timing of study treatment discontinuation in the ixazomib and placebo regimens was comparable, 
higher in the first 6 cycles and decreased over time.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at the proposed dose and schedule has 
been assessed in 460 MM patients out of whom 360 represent the target population of MM patients 
who have received at least one prior therapy. Additional data in patients who have received oral 
ixazomib with different posology, indications or as single agent, contribute to the safety evaluation of 
ixazomib. Overall, the size of the safety database is considered sufficient to allow adequate assessment 
of the safety profile.

The safety evaluation is focused primarily on the pivotal study results.  
The safety profile of the combination ixazomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone was overall similar to 
that seen with lenalidomide +dexamethasone, and patients received a median of 12 cycles of 
treatment. Most of the AE tend to occur at the beginning of the treatment and declined with continued 
exposure. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) across 360 patients treated each within the  
ixazomib and placebo regimens in the pivotal clinical trial were diarrhoea (42% vs. 36%), constipation 
(34% vs. 25%), thrombocytopenia (28% vs. 14%), peripheral neuropathy (28% vs. 21%), nausea 
(26% vs. 21%), peripheral oedema (25% vs. 18%), vomiting (22% vs. 11%), and back pain (21% vs. 
16%). 
In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, the following adverse reactions occurred with a similar rate between the 
NINLARO and placebo regimens: fatigue (28% vs. 26%), neutropenia (30% vs. 27%), decreased 
appetite (13% vs. 9%), hypotension (5% vs. 4%), heart failure (4% vs. 3%), arrhythmia (13% each), 
and liver impairment including enzyme changes (6% vs. 5%). 
The addition of ixazomib to the backbone standard lendex results in an increase in gastrointestinal AE, 
peripheral oedema, thrombocytopenia, and maculopapular rash but primarily due to a higher frequency 
of low grade events except for thrombocytopenia, which had a difference in frequency across all 
grades. However, potential consequences of thrombocytopaenia like bleeding (18% ixazomib vs 16% 
placebo for all grades; 2% ixazomib vs <1% placebo for grade 3 or higher), and the need for platelet 
transfusions (6% ixazomib vs 5% placebo) were similar in both arms. Thrombocytopaenia was a 
transient, predictable and manageable event. 
Only 20% of patients needed at least one dose reduction of ixazomib, and 3% needed the dose 
reduction twice, and therefore the treatment seems well tolerated.  
A trend for grade 3 or 4 AE or AE that resulted in dose modification was noted for older subgroup of 
patients but probably reflects the effect of age itself and not the addition of ixazomib as it were also 
seen in the control arm of the pivotal study. 
Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients included thrombocytopenia (2%) and diarrhoea 
(2%). Overall serious adverse events occurred with similar frequency and type of event across the two 
arms of the pivotal study and pneumonia was the most frequently reported. 
Outside of the Phase 3 study, the following serious adverse reactions were rarely reported: acute 
febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet’s syndrome), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, transverse myelitis, 
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, tumour lysis syndrome and thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura. 
Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered in patients being treated with Ninlaro to decrease the risk of 
herpes zoster reactivation. Patients included in studies with ninlaro who received antiviral prophylaxis 
had a lower incidence of herpes zoster infection compared to patients who did not receive prophylaxis.  
The potential risk of thromboembolism expected in combination with lenalidomide is not increased, 
probably because the majority of patients in the pivotal study had received thromboprophylaxis. 
Thrombocytopenia has been reported with ixazomib with platelet nadirs typically occurring between 
Days 14-21 of each 28 day cycle and recovery to baseline by the start of the next cycle. Platelet counts 
should be monitored at least monthly during ixazomib treatment. More frequent monitoring should be 
considered during the first three cycles as per the lenalidomide SmPC. Thrombocytopenia can be 
managed with dose modifications and platelet transfusions as per standard medical guidelines.

Diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting have been reported with ixazomib, occasionally requiring 
use of antiemetic and antidiarrhoeal medicinal products and supportive care. The dose should be 
adjusted for severe (Grade 3–4) symptoms.  
No safety concern has been identified with regards to new primary malignancies but long term safety 
data is needed. Appropriate handling of this as proposed in the RMP is considered sufficient. 
Fungal and viral pneumonia resulting in fatal outcome were rarely reported in patients given the 
ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination. 
Non clinical data showed a potential for irreversible peripheral nervous system effects. As a 
proteasome inhibitor ixazomib does not cause concern with regards to neuropathy. Although there was 
a mild increase in peripheral neuropathy with ixazomib regimen compared to placebo (28% ixazomib 
vs 21% placebo), it was mainly due to low grade events and led to drug discontinuation in a small 
number of patients in each arm. However, more mature data is needed to confirm that peripheral 
neuropathy toxicity is not increased in the long term as patients will be recommended to take the 
triplet combination until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
It appears that gastrointestinal toxicity, peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia seen in the 
proposed ixazomib combination are of lower frequency than that reported for bortezomib, although 
there is no available direct comparison between the two proteasome inhibitors. It appears that 
ixazomib has no worse safety profile than bortezomib. 
No other concerns have been raised for adverse events associated with other proteasome inhibitors or 
lenalidomide. 
The discontinuation rate of 1 or more drugs or the full drug combination in the ixazomib regimen is 
similar to that seen in the placebo control and indicate that adding ixazomib to lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone does not result in a significant increase in toxicity. 
A consistent similar safety profile to the ixazomib regimen in the pivotal study was seen in the overall 
safety analysis which included patients dosed with oral ixazomib (either as single agent or in 
combination with other agents) across a range of indications.   
There are no data on the effect of ixazomib on the ability to drive or operate machinery. Fatigue and 
dizziness have been observed in clinical trials. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate 
machines if they experience any of these symptoms. 
There is no known specific antidote for ixazomib overdose. Clinical data is limited but doses up to 12 
mg have been reported in the randomized controlled trial. In the event of an overdose, monitor the 
patient for adverse reactions and provide appropriate supportive care. 
No major safety concerns have been identified. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of the proposed treatment regimen with ixazomib as add-on to lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone is considered acceptable with gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, 
vomiting), haematological (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), fatigue, peripheral oedema, 
back pain and nasopharyngitis being the most common adverse events.

Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia has been reported with NINLARO 
(see section 4.8) with platelet nadirs typically 
occurring between Days 14-21 of each 28-day cycle 
and recovery to baseline by the start of the next 
cycle (see section 4.8).  
Platelet counts should be monitored at least monthly 
during NINLARO treatment. More frequent 
monitoring should be considered during the first 
three cycles as per the lenalidomide SmPC. 
Thrombocytopenia can be managed with dose 
modifications (see section 4.2) and platelet 
transfusions as per standard medical guidelines. 
SmPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: 
Thrombocytopenia is included as one of the most 
frequently reported adverse reactions for NINLARO 
and is listed in the adverse reactions table. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Three percent of patients in the NINLARO regimen 
and 1% of patients in the placebo regimen had a 
platelet count ≤10,000/mm3 during treatment. Less 
than 1% of patients in both regimens had a platelet 
count ≤5000/mm3 during treatment. 
Thrombocytopenia resulted in discontinuation of one 
or more of the three drugs in <1% of patients in the 
NINLARO regimen and 2% of patients in the placebo 
regimen. Thrombocytopenia did not result in an 
increase in hemorrhagic events or platelet

Pregnancy 
Women should avoid becoming pregnant while being 
treated with NINLARO. If NINLARO is used during 
pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while 
taking NINLARO, the patient should be apprised of 
the potential hazard to the foetus. 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly 
effective contraception while taking NINLARO and for 
90 days after stopping treatment (see section 4.5 
and 4.6). Women using hormonal contraceptives 
should additionally use a barrier method of 
contraception. 
SmPC Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction 
Oral Contraceptives 
When ixazomib is administered together with 
dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other 
enzymes and transporters, the risk for reduced 
efficacy of oral contraceptives needs to be 
considered. Women using hormonal contraceptives 
should additionally use a barrier method of 
contraception.

The ixazomib triplet regimen had a 35% improvement in the primary endpoint PFS compared to 
placebo regimen and reached a statistically significant difference (Median PFS 20.6 months Ixazomib 
vs 14.7 months placebo; HR=0.742; 95% CI: 0.587, 0.939; p=0.012).

Progression Free Survival analysis in all subgroups populations was in favour of Ixazomib regimen 
(HR<1), including subgroups with adverse prognostic factors and across all ages, with the exception of 
patients with baseline creatinine clearance < 60/ml/min (HR 1.032). 
Progression Free Survival in the combined high-risk subgroup of patients with del(17), t(4;14), and 
t(14;16) was in favour of Ixazomib regimen (median PFS 21.4 months in the ixazomib versus 9.7 
months in the placebo; HR=0.543; p=0.021). 
Progression Free Survival in patients with del (17) who are considered the ultra-high-risk group was in 
favour of ixazomib regimen (median 21.4 months ixazomib vs 9.7 months placebo; HR=0.596; 
p=0.162). 
Overall Survival favours the ixazomib regimen (median OS not reached in either arm; HR=0.900; 95% 
CI: 0.615, 1.316). 
Overall Survival in patients with deletion chromosome 17 who are considered the ultra-high risk 
patient population, reported a 49% reduction in risk of death for the ixazomib regimen (HR 0.506) and 
an 18 month survival rate of 86% for ixazomib regimen vs 67% with placebo. 
The ixazomib regimen delayed the time to disease progression by approximately 6 months (median 
TTP 21.4 months in the ixazomib arm vs 15.7 months in the placebo arm; HR=0.712; CI 0.556, 0.912; 
p=0.007). 
Response to treatment was reported with statistically significant difference in favour of ixazomib 
regimen, including overall response rate CR+PR (OR= 1.44 (1.03, 2.03), p=0.035), CR+VGPR (OR= 
1.45 (1.08, 1.95), p=0.014) and CR (OR= 1.87 (1.10, 3.16), p=0.019). 
Duration of response to treatment is longer with ixazomib regimen with median DOR 20.5 months 
ixazomib (16.62, NE) vs 15.0 m placebo (11.99, NE). 
The subgroup of patients who have experienced at least one relapse with ISS stage III disease or 
elevated-risk cytogenetics [del(17), t(4;14), t(14;16), or 1q21+]; or experienced at least 2 relapses) 
reported a median PFS benefit of 6.2 months: 18.4 months in the ixazomib regimen versus 12.2 
months in the placebo regimen at the primary analysis (HR= 0.700 [p=0.009]), and at the updated 
analysis a median PFS benefit of 6 months (18.9 months vs 12.9 months; HR=0.745 [p=0.015]). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Efficacy data is based on a planned interim analysis (data cut-off October 2014) where the statistical 
evidence for the primary endpoint (p=0.012) achieved the pre-specified threshold for claiming benefit 
at the interim (p<0.0163). The result is not considered compelling for a single pivotal study 
(replicating the evidence from two trials positive at p<0.05 a P<0.00125 would be required). 
Updated efficacy data from a second interim analysis representing the most up-to date data, showed a 
reduced difference in effect between arms in the overall ITT population for PFS, response rates and 
time to progression compared to previous analysis. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for the updated PFS 
analysis was 0.818 (0.67, 1.0) compared to 0.742 (0.587, 0.939) as seen previously.  
It is not possible to identify a higher-risk subgroup that could benefit from treatment with ixazomib, 
especially based on post-hoc analysis and in view of non-compelling overall results. In addition, the 
results for the primary analysis and for sub-groups worsen from the first interim analysis to the second 
interim analysis and where the better results seen in high-risk patients appeared to be driven by 
patients with del(17) in the first interim analysis, but seemed driven by those with t(4;14) in the 
second interim analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016

Some regional differences were noted, and in Japan, a better PFS outcome was reported in the placebo 
arm compared with the ixazomib arm (HR 1.327) which may be due to baseline disease differences 
compared to the global ITT population. 
Median OS is not evaluable yet and the data is considered immature. Further analysis on longer follow 
up is needed to exclude a detrimental impact on OS with Ixazomib regimen. 
In adult patients with multiple myeloma who have experienced at least one relapse with ISS stage III 
disease or elevated-risk cytogenetics [del(17), t(4;14), t(14;16), or 1q21+]; or experienced at least 2 
relapses) there is a lack of clinical rationale for post hoc arguments that efficacy is greater in this 
population. There is substantial uncertainty associated with the interpretation of post hoc subgroup 
analyses, including a number of inconsistencies in the data regarding risk factors for early progression.  
Analyses in this subgroup were not statistically compelling and differences from the overall ITT 
population are considered likely to be chance findings. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) across 360 patients treated each within the  
ixazomib and placebo regimens in the pivotal clinical trial were diarrhoea (45% vs. 39%), constipation 
(35% vs. 26%), thrombocytopenia (24% vs. 11%), peripheral neuropathy (28% vs. 21%), nausea 
(29% vs. 22%), peripheral oedema (28% vs. 20%), vomiting (23% vs. 12%), and back pain (24% vs. 
17%).  
Thrombocytopaenia is reported in 20% of patients receiving the Ixazomib regimen (vs 10% placebo) 
with the difference between the two regimens across all grades, including Grade 3/4 (17% ixazomib 
and 8% placebo). All grades of bleeding [18% ixazomib and 16% placebo], Grade 3 or higher bleeding 
[2% ixazomib and <1% placebo], and need for platelet transfusions [6% ixazomib and 5% placebo] 
were reported. Thrombocytopaenia with ixazomib regimen has a nadir at day 14-21 of the treatment 
cycle, is predictable, reversible and manageable with supportive care and platelet transfusion. 
There is an increase in gastrointestinal toxicity with ixazomib regimen compared to placebo regimen 
(74% vs 68%), specifically for diarrhoea (45% vs 39%), nausea (29% vs 22%) and vomiting (24% vs 
11%). The majority of events were of low grade and diarrhoea was the only AE that occurred as a 
grade 3 in at least 5% of patients with Ixazomib (6% ixazomib vs 3% placebo). No grade 4 events 
were reported. Nausea or vomiting did not result in drug discontinuation while diarrhoea led to 
treatment discontinuation (1 or more agents in combination) in 5 patients in ixazomib regimen (vs 3 
patients in placebo). The gastrointestinal toxicity is managed and some events may be prevented with 
supportive care (e. g. antiemetics). 
The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 28% in the ixazomib regimen and 21% in the placebo 
mostly of Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly peripheral neuropathy reported was sensory. Both 
regimens had a 2% incidence of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy events and no grade 4 events were 
reported. Discontinuations of ≥1 of the agents in the study drug regimen were infrequent (1% in each 
regimen). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are no important uncertainties in the knowledge of unfavourable effects.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
At the first interim analysis of the pivotal study, a 6 months improvement in PFS was reported when 
ixazomib was added to the standard Lendex regimen. This PFS improvement was considered clinically 
meaningful and significant, especially as it showed a consistent benefit in patients with high risk 
cytogenetic abnormalities, across subgroups, and other endpoints. However the statistical approach 
was not as rigorous as expected in an application with a single pivotal study.  The second interim 
analysis including more mature data has shown a reduced difference in effect between arms in the 
overall ITT population for PFS, response rates and time to progression compared to previous analysis. 
This is of major concern, especially in an application based on a single pivotal study. 
The Applicant has tried to identify a subpopulation of patients with poor prognosis in whom the efficacy 
of ixazomib can be demonstrated and proposed the indication for the treatment in patients with one 
prior therapy and adverse risk characteristics, or for patients after two prior therapies.  The 
terminology of adverse risk characteristics is considered too broad. Data in some subgroups with 
adverse risk characteristics did not show add on benefit of ixazomib and restriction by line of therapy 
may not be appropriate due to the high heterogeneity in terms of prior treatments. The results from 
the ITT population are not impressive and there is substantial uncertainty associated with the 
interpretation of post hoc subgroup analyses. In addition the results worsen from the first to the 
second interim analysis for these subgroups and for the overall ITT population.   
More mature data is needed to exclude any detrimental effect on survival.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance for ixazomib for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who 
have experienced at least one relapse with ISS stage III disease or elevated-risk cytogenetics [del(17), 
t(4;14), t(14;16), or 1q21+]; or experienced at least 2 relapses is considered negative.

Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Efficacy data remains insufficient for approval in the proposed subgroup of patients. It is unknown 
what drives the benefits in some particular subgroups and there is no clinical rationale. Efficacy data in 
the overall ITT population does not provide the level of evidence expected on an application based on a 
single pivotal trial and there is still large uncertainty associated with the interpretation of subgroup 
analysis.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Ninlaro is not similar to Thalidomide Celgene, Revlimid, 
Imnovid, Farydak, Kyprolis and Daratumumab within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for NINLARO in the treatment of 
adult patients with multiple myeloma who have experienced at least one relapse with ISS stage III 
disease or elevated-risk cytogenetics [del(17), t(4;14), t(14;16), or 1q21+]; or experienced at least 2 
relapses the CHMP considers by consensus that the  efficacy of  the above mentioned medicinal 
product is not sufficiently demonstrated, and, therefore recommends the refusal of the granting of the 
Marketing Authorisation  for the above mentioned medicinal product. The CHMP considers that: 
The evidence of efficacy in the proposed indicated patient populations (adult patients with multiple 
myeloma who have experienced at least one relapse with ISS stage III disease or elevated-risk 
cytogenetics [del(17), t(4;14), t(14;16), or 1q21+]; or experienced at least 2 relapses) is considered 
insufficient. The data are currently immature, especially for overall survival which is not yet evaluable. 
Efficacy data in the overall ITT population from the first and second interim analyses do not provide 
the statistically compelling evidence expected for an application based on a single pivotal trial. Point 
estimates for efficacy measures are not sufficiently outstanding in the context of other available 
treatment options. There is a lack of clinical rationale for post hoc arguments that efficacy is greater in 
the higher risk subgroups proposed for the revised indications. There is substantial uncertainty 
associated with the interpretation of post hoc subgroup analyses, including a number of inconsistencies 
in the data regarding risk factors for early progression.  Analyses in these subgroups were not 
statistically compelling and differences from the overall ITT population are considered likely to be 
chance findings.  
Due to the aforementioned concerns a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, labelling, 
package leaflet, risk management plan and post-authorisation measures cannot be agreed at this 
stage. 
New Active Substance Status 
Furthermore, the CHMP, in light of the negative recommendation, is of the opinion that it is not 
appropriate to conclude on the new active substance status at this time. 
5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 26 May 2016 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Ninlaro was not approvable based on the efficacy grounds outlined 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 128/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
above, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.  
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented detailed grounds for re-examination in writing and at an oral explanation. 
A summary of the applicant’s grounds for re-examination is presented below. 
Clinical Ground No. 1 (Efficacy data in the overall ITT population from the first and second interim 
analyses do not provide the statistically compelling evidence expected for an application based on a 
single pivotal trial).  
The applicant argued that the efficacy data in Study C16010—from both interim analyses (IAs)—do 
provide statistically compelling evidence, with confirmation in a second study, the China Continuation 
study. In Study C16010, the pre-specified boundary was crossed at the planned first PFS analysis, thus 
making the first IA the final analysis for PFS for statistical testing purposes. However, the study was 
not stopped after the first IA because the long-term endpoint of OS, an important secondary endpoint, 
was continuing to be followed. Because the study was to continue in a blind fashion, the FDA requested 
that the applicant take the opportunity to conduct a non-inferential sensitivity analysis for PFS at the 
planned second IA, which was supposed to focus on OS. In a normal group sequential design setting, 
the applicant would not have performed another analysis for PFS, and there would be no second IA 
data for PFS for Study C16010 had it not had continued the study for the key secondary endpoint 
(OS). According to the applicant the basis of Study C16010 design, the first IA (date cut-off date, 
October 2014, median follow-up of 15 months) is the primary analysis for PFS, as pre-specified more 
stringent criteria has been met; the second IA (data cut-off date, July 2015, median follow up of 23 
months) is only a sensitivity analysis for PFS and should be interpreted as such. 
Clinical Ground No. 2 (There is substantial uncertainty associated with the interpretation of post-hoc 
subgroup analyses, including a number of inconsistencies in the data regarding risk factors for early 
progression; analyses in these subgroups were not statistically compelling and differences from the 
overall ITT population are considered likely to be chance findings).  
The applicant modified the applied indication: ‘‘Ninlaro in combination with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with MM who have received at least 2 
prior therapies and are not refractory to lenalidomide or proteasome inhibitors’’.  The applicant 
considered the proposed subgroup with at least 2 prior therapies, as ascertained as a stratification 
factor, to be an appropriate, robust subgroup to propose as the indication population. According to the 
applicant, the subgroup is pre-specified with its analyses conducted on the basis of the ITT principle, 
the patient and disease characteristics are well balanced between the treatment regimens, and the 
findings for the subgroup are robust against being due to chance. The applicant argued that this 
subgroup is relatively large (41% of the ITT population), has a highly significant effect size, meets the 
definition of a credible subgroup and shows a PFS benefit (HR 0.580, p=0.003, at the primary analysis, 
and HR=0.617, p=0.003, at the non-inferential analysis (July 2015) with a median of 9 months) with 
the ixazomib+LenDex that is mature, consistent between the 2 analyses, indicates a positive risk-
benefit profile, supported by investigator-determined data and secondary efficacy endpoints, and 
confirmed in the China Continuation study. 
Clinical Ground No. 3 (The evidence of efficacy in the proposed indicated patient populations (adult 
patients with multiple myeloma who have experienced at least one relapse with ISS stage III disease 
or elevated-risk cytogenetics [del(17), t(4;14), t(14;16), or 1q21+], or experienced at least 2 
relapses) is considered insufficient; the data are currently immature, especially for overall survival 
which is not yet evaluable).  
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 129/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As mentioned above (clinical ground No. 2) the applicant modified the applied indication and 
considered that in the subgroup of patients who have been previously treated with at least 2 prior 
therapies, the PFS benefit with the ixazomib regimen is consistent across the follow up periods and is 
mature. Further, the PFS benefit is accompanied by high response rates and a trend toward an OS 
advantage. This efficacy benefit was not accompanied by substantial additional toxicity, which allows 
for long-term treatment and disease control. Additionally patient reported QOL (per EORTC QLQ-C30 or 
EQ-5D scores) was maintained. These data are notable given the context of a double-blind, placebo-
controlled study. The efficacy benefit with the better safety profile of the ixazomib regimen combined 
with the benefit of an all oral dosing regimen offers patients the opportunity to work and live, almost 
normally, while effectively controlling their disease. This provides an important contribution to the care 
of patients with MM. 
Clinical Ground No. 4 (There is a lack of clinical rationale for post-hoc arguments that efficacy is 
greater in the higher-risk subgroups proposed for the revised indication).   
On the basis of preliminary analyses and a review of the literature, the applicant posited the 
hypothesis that the subgroup of patients with at least 2 prior therapies has increased sensitivity to 
ixazomib because of a number of factors, including the clinical features of these patients and the 
evolution of MM clones that are more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. One important mechanism by 
which ixazomib+LenDex appears to overcome the negative prognosis associated with 2 or more prior 
therapies may rest in the ability to target MM clones with increased genome instability and 
aggressiveness, such as overexpression of the gene MYC (Deshaies RJ. , 2014). The fact that IMiDs 
work better when used earlier in the course of disease, (Stadtmauer EA, et al. 2009) where a more 
limited repertoire of abnormalities are present, supports the hypothesis of clonal evolution. Previous 
exposure to IMiDs is very common among the subgroup with at least 2 prior therapies in Study 
C16010, suggesting placebo+LenDex would have less benefit than ixazomib+LenDex. High MYC 
expression frequently predicts for aggressive biological behaviour, advanced stage of disease, 
increased likelihood of relapse, and poor clinical outcome in MM. In Study C16010, MYC expression is 
higher in the subgroup with at least 2 prior therapies than in the subgroup with 1 prior therapy 
(p=0.0164), and the PFS benefit for the ixazomib regimen versus the placebo regimen is significantly 
higher among patients whose tumours express c-MYC levels above the median. In tumours with 
already high MYC expression, proteasome inhibition may further increase MYC expression, leading to 
induction of cell death.  
Clinical Ground No. 5 (Positive benefit-risk profile of the ixazomib regimen for the subgroup with at 
least 2 prior therapies in the context of other available therapies).  
The applicant has performed an historical comparison of the ixazomib regimen with other available 
therapies. In the proposed indication of patients who received at least 2 prior therapies, the clinical 
benefit of ixazomib (PFS HR=0.58) compares favourably to other approved combinations: panobinostat 
HR=0.64, carfilzomib HR=0.69, and elotuzumab HR=0.65. The applicant argued that the safety profile 
of ixazomib has already been accepted by CHMP and provides needed options, especially for the 
heterogeneous and comorbid proposed subgroup of patients with at least 2 prior therapies. Further, 
QOL was maintained in the ixazomib regimen as compared with the placebo regimen, whereas, by 
contrast, in the PANORAMA-1 study, the panobinostat regimen was associated with significant 
worsening of QOL. With the caveat of open-label trials that may favour the interventional arm, 
ELOQUENT-2 reported QOL that was maintained in the elotuzumab regimen and in the ASPIRE study; 
QOL was higher in the carfilzomib regimen for a few domains. 
The applicant concluded that, point estimates associated with ixazomib+LenDex for efficacy measures 
for the subgroup with at least 2 prior therapies are sufficiently outstanding in the context of other 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 130/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
available treatment options. When safety, tolerability, QOL, and impact on health care utilization are 
considered along with efficacy, the benefit-risk profile of ixazomib+LenDex compares favourably with 
those of other available therapies for RRMM. 
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened a 
Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) inviting the experts to provide their views on the CHMP grounds for 
refusal, taking into account the applicant’s response.  
Report from the SAG 
As a general comment, the SAG considered unanimously that the data submitted on the basis of the 
primary ITT analysis of PFS of the pivotal trial C16010 (HR=0.742; P=0.012), and, importantly, the 
favourable toxicity profile, establish a clearly positive benefit-risk balance in the broad indication 
consistent with the studies’ main entry criteria (patients with multiple myeloma who have received at 
least one prior therapy, see patient characteristics of trial C16010).  
The SAG discussed the concerns that have been raised about efficacy, due to the results of a 
subsequent analysis of PFS showing a reduced statistical significance. However, the SAG considered 
that on the basis of the primary PFS analysis, which was conducted according to the pre-specified 
statistical considerations, the trial met its objective of showing a statistically and clinically significant 
improvement in PFS. In terms of primary statistical procedure, the planned final test (2014) at 286 IRC 
PFS events (i.e., 40% of patients progressed) was significant at the designated point. 
The maturity of the dataset was considered adequate and consistent with other pivotal trials in this 
setting. Additionally, the supportive data from the China Continuation Study provided corroborative 
findings in terms of a statistical and clinically significant effect in terms of PFS (HR=0.598; P=0.035). 
The robustness of this conclusion is also supported by internal consistency, namely, the favourable 
trends in terms of OS in the pivotal and supportive studies (HR=0.868, P=0.36, and HR=0.323, 
P=0.013, respectively), as well as the biological rationale for proteasome inhibitor therapy in multiple 
myeloma. 
The fact that a subsequent exploratory analysis showed some uncertainty about the level of statistical 
significance is not enough to change the conclusions about a clear beneficial effect in terms of PFS on 
the basis of the pre-planned analysis. However, it is acknowledged that the size of the effect observed 
in the primary analysis might be an over-estimation. This uncertainty about the size of the effect has 
to be weighed into the benefit-risk assessment.  
Concerning the benefit-risk assessment and managing uncertainty about magnitude of the effect, it is 
important to note that ixazomib was associated with a favourable toxicity profile. The incidence of 
grade 3 or higher adverse events was similar across treatment groups (76% v. 77% for placebo and 
ixazomib, respectively); the incidence of drug-related serious adverse events was similar across 
treatment groups (29% v. 28% for placebo and ixazomib, respectively); and there was no detriment in 
health-related quality of life based on EORTC-QLQ-C30.   
Concerning the benefit-risk balance, given the favourable toxicity profile, even in the case of an over-
estimation, the SAG was confident that a positive benefit-risk balance has been established. 
Concerning the possible uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect, this uncertainty seems 
acceptable given the favourable toxicity profile, and considering that ixazomib is the first agent to 
allow oral triple combination therapy, which represents a therapeutic innovation in terms of 
convenience for patients.  
These considerations apply to all questions which explore the effect of ixazomib in the subgroups of 
patients with one or more prior therapies. Although it is acknowledged that in exploratory analyses a 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 131/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more pronounced effect was observed in patients at higher risk or having 2 or more, or perhaps 3 
previous therapies, these findings are based on exploratory subgroup analyses without robust 
multiplicity adjustment. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to exclude that there is a clinically relevant 
effect also in patients at lower risk of progression or that had only 1 prior line of therapy.  
1.  Are the concerns on the data maturity (PFS and confirmation by OS) still valid? 
The number of events is considered in line with what is generally expected in the field for trials of this 
size in this population. Hence the ITT analysis is therefore considered mature and the observed effect 
(about 6 month difference in median PFS) as clinically relevant. Although subsequent analyses showed 
slightly less statistical significance, this slight fluctuation is not considered to invalidate the conclusions 
of the primary analysis, based on the totality of the data. 
The OS analysis is not considered sufficiently mature and it is also possible that in view of new agents 
with impact on OS a clear difference in terms of OS might be difficult to observe in the long term. In 
multiple myeloma in this treatment setting, however, PFS is considered a clinically relevant endpoint 
and the magnitude of the effect quite significant. In addition, the favourable trend in OS in the ITT 
populations is promising and one can rule out a detrimental effect on OS with reasonable certainty. 
2.  Please discuss in the context of one single pivotal study supported only by the Chinese 
trial, whether the proposal for a restricted indication based on the choice for the 
subgroup ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy is acceptable? This also taking into account the 
arguments of the Applicant and the concept that type of prior treatment may also be 
relevant for the response to next line treatment. 
The SAG did not agree about drawing firm conclusions based on the post-hoc analyses presented. 
Although it was acknowledged that these analyses are based on pre-specified stratification factors in 
the context of an overall positive ITT analysis, and on external validation from another study, it is 
difficult to assess the significance of these findings without proper multiplicity adjustment. More 
importantly, although there are a number of plausible hypotheses that could explain this finding, a 
robust biological rationale has not been identified.  
The primary ITT analysis is considered still the most relevant and is statistically and clinically 
convincing.  
The fact that the results are based on a single pivotal trial is not considered an issue in view of the 
convincing results, the supportive evidence from the China Continuation Study and the entirety of the 
evidence. Taken together with the limited toxicity and possibility of oral dosing, the uncertainty related 
to the effect size is not considered enough to outweigh the benefits. 
3.  Please discuss in light of other available lenalidomide-based triplet regimens, whether 
the improvement in median PFS of approximately 9 months in the pre-specified 
subgroup (≥ 2 prior lines of therapy) indicate clinical benefit in this clinical setting, 
despite the lack of mature OS data.  
Recently approved drugs for the treatment of multiple myeloma have shown improvements in median 
in PFS in the range of 4 to 6 months. The 6-months improvement observed in the ITT population 
clearly and convincingly indicates clinical benefit for this first orally available triple-drug regimen. 
4.  Results in the heavily pre-treated population (new claimed indication) contrast with 
what is observed in patients treated with one previous line only. Is there any rationale 
to explain this contrast and to exclude that is was produced at least in part by chance? 
This finding is somewhat in contrast with what is observed with other drugs and tumour types where 
the effect is generally opposite. Thus, the finding from exploratory analyses should be looked at 
carefully. There are a number of hypotheses possible, including the burden of disease and clonal 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 132/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
developments, the emergence of particular mutations, immunological mechanisms, etc. However, it is 
difficult to conclude with certainty about any of these hypotheses on the basis of these exploratory 
analyses. 
The level to which the subgroup analysis stands out is a common situation in clinical trial analysis. Any 
correction for this level of subgroup multiplicity, in absence of a strong a priori rationale for the 
direction of this finding, would not be statistically significant. For example, one possible correction 
factor would be 18. 
If any opportunistic subgroup would need to be selected on the basis of available data, it would 
possibly be for 3 prior treatments  which is the subgroup that stands out most in the Forest plot, while 
2 prior lines is not very different to 1 prior line.  
In conclusion, there does not seem to be a strong rationale or statistical evidence to exclude a 
significant effect also in patients with 1 prior line of treatment. Translational research is ongoing to 
identify subjects more likely to respond on the basis of mutational and expression analyses (e.g., the 
oncogene c-myc expression). These data should be thoroughly evaluated when available to inform 
selection strategies to identify subjects more likely to benefit from ixazomib.  
5.  Please discuss the potential added value of an all oral treatment regimen like the 
currently proposed regimen with ixazomib + LenDex in this clinical setting, and please 
also discuss if this compensates for the observed uncertainties? 
Oral dosing is undoubtedly a major added value as ixazomib is the first agent to allow effective oral 
triple-combination therapy. This should have a major impact in terms of the subjects’ convenience, 
particularly when compared to intravenous treatments requiring frequent visits to the clinic. Any 
uncertainties about the effect size in terms of OS or PFS are considered acceptable in view of the low 
toxicity and the additional benefits. 
6.  Should a potential indication refer to the type of prior treatments (SCT yes or no) in view 
of the results of the exploratory analyses on the subgroups with prior SCT? 
At present, it is difficult to conclude on the basis of exploratory analyses presented. However, the 
effect did not seem to be dramatically different in these subgroups. Thus, referring to prior treatments 
(SCT yes of no) does not seem necessary. 
Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
applicant and considered the views of the Scientific Advisory Group.  
Concerning Clinical Ground No. 1, the CHMP considered that the primary endpoint, PFS was met and 
the result was robust in the first planned interim analysis (IA), 20.6 months in the ixazomib+LenDex 
regimen versus 14.7 months in the placebo+LenDex regimen (p=0.012 and HR 0.742). However, 
updated efficacy data from a second interim analysis representing the most up-to date data, showed a 
reduced difference in effect between arms in the overall ITT population for PFS, response rates and 
time to progression compared to previous analysis. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for the updated PFS 
analysis was 0.818 (0.67, 1.0) compared to 0.742 (0.587, 0.939) as seen previously. 
The CHMP acknowledged the applicant’s argumentations that the second IA is only a sensitivity 
analysis, and should be interpreted as such and concluded that it is difficult not to acknowledge the 
positive result of a large clinical trial (n=722) in this clinical setting.   
The CHMP, however, noted, that the total avaialable evidence on efficacy is not as comprehensive as 
normally would be required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 133/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concerning Clinical Ground No. 2 the CHMP did not agree that there would be sufficient grounds to 
define the target population in the indication as patients who have received at least 2 prior therapies, 
as proposed by the applicant since the results are based on post-hoc analyses. The CHMP acknowldged 
that the number of prior therapies was a pre-specified stratification factor (1 vs. 2-3 therapies) in the 
SAP. Furthermore the size of this subgroup was considerable (a total of 297 of the 722 patients) and 
there were no substantial differences between baseline characteristics in the different treatment arms. 
However, it is not possible to correctly assess the significance of these findings without proper 
multiplicity adjustment. 
In addition, the results in the heavily pre-treated population (new proposed indication) contrast with 
what is observed in patients treated with one previous line only and there does not seem to be a 
biological rationale or statistical evidence to exclude a significant effect also in patients with 1 prior line 
of treatment. 
The CHMP therefore considered that the efficacy evidence is equally relevant for the entire population 
included in the pivotal study, i.e. multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy. 
Concerning Clinical Ground No. 3 the CHMP opinion remained negative regarding the previous 
proposed indication. The evidence of efficacy in the proposed patient populations (adult patients with 
multiple myeloma who have experienced at least one relapse with ISS stage III disease or elevated-
risk cytogenetics [del(17), t(4;14), t(14;16), or 1q21+], or experienced at least 2 relapses) is 
considered insufficient. 
Concerning Clinical Ground No. 4 the CHMP acknowledged the several mechanisms that could explain 
the increased sensitivity to ixazomib in the subgroup of patients with at least two prior therapies, 
compared to one prior therapy however it is not possible confirm them by obervations in clinical 
practice. 
Therefore the CHMP concluded that there is a lack of clinical rationale to explain the supposed greater 
efficacy in the higher-risk subgroups, proposed as basis for the revised indication. 
Concerning Clinical Ground No. 5 the CHMP concluded that recently approved drugs for the treatment 
of multiple myeloma have shown improvements in median in PFS in the range of 4 to 6 months; 
therefore the 5.9 months improvement observed in the ITT population is considered clinically relevant.

Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia has been reported with NINLARO 
(see section 4.8) with platelet nadirs typically occurring 
between Days 14-21 of each 28-day cycle and recovery 
to baseline by the start of the next cycle (see section 
4.8).  
Platelet counts should be monitored at least monthly 
during NINLARO treatment. More frequent monitoring 
should be considered during the first three cycles as per 
the lenalidomide SmPC. Thrombocytopenia can be 
managed with dose modifications (see section 4.2) and 
platelet transfusions as per standard medical guidelines. 
SmPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: 
Thrombocytopenia is included as one of the most 
frequently reported adverse reactions for NINLARO and 
is listed in the adverse reactions table. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Three percent of patients in the NINLARO regimen and 
1% of patients in the placebo regimen had a platelet 
count ≤10,000/mm3 during treatment. Less than 1% of 
patients in both regimens had a platelet count 
≤5,000/mm3 during treatment. Thrombocytopenia 
resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the three 
medicinal products in <1% of patients in the NINLARO 
regimen and 2% of patients in the placebo regimen. 
Thrombocytopenia did not result in an increase in 
haemorrhagic events or platelet transfusions.

use: 
Pregnancy 
Women should avoid becoming pregnant while being 
treated with NINLARO. If NINLARO is used during 
pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while 
taking NINLARO, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the foetus. 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly 
effective contraception while taking NINLARO and for 90 
days after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 
4.6). Women using hormonal contraceptives should 
additionally use a barrier method of contraception. 
SmPC Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction 
Oral Contraceptives 
When NINLARO is administered together with 
dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes 
and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy of oral 
contraceptives needs to be considered. Women using 
oral hormonal contraceptives should additionally use a 
barrier method of contraception. 
SmPC Section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation: 
As NINLARO is administered in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone, refer to the SmPC for 
these medicinal products for additional information on 
fertility, pregnancy and lactation.

recommended in women of childbearing potential not 
using contraception. 
When NINLARO is administered together with 
dexamethasone, which is known to be a weak to 
moderate inducer of CYP3A4 as well as other enzymes 
and transporters, the risk for reduced efficacy of oral 
contraceptives needs to be considered. 
Therefore,women using oral hormonal contraceptives 
should additionally use a barrier method of 
contraception. 
Pregnancy 
NINLARO is not recommended during pregnancy as it 
can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Therefore, women should avoid becoming 
pregnant while being treated with NINLARO.  
There are no data for the use of NINLARO in pregnant 
women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive 
toxicity (see section 5.3). 
NINLARO is given in combination with lenalidomide, 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. 
Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth 
defects. If lenalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a 
teratogenic effect in humans is expected. The conditions 
of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme for 
lenalidomide must be fulfilled for all patients unless 
there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have 
childbearing potential. Please refer to the current 
lenalidomide SmPC. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether NINLARO/or its metabolites are 
excreted in human milk. No animal data are available. 
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded and 
therefore breast-feeding should be discontinued. 
NINLARO will be given in combination with lenalidomide 
and breast-feeding should be stopped because of the 
use of lenalidomide.

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
5.3.  Product information 
5.3.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
5.3.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ninlaro (ixazomib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU, and is to be approved under conditional 
marketing authorisation. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
6.  Benefit-risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In pivotal trial, the ixazomib triplet regimen had a 35% improvement in the primary endpoint PFS 
compared to placebo regimen and reached a statistically significant difference (Median PFS 20.6 
months Ixazomib vs 14.7 months placebo; HR=0.742; 95% CI: 0.587, 0.939; p=0.012). 
Assessment report

Progression Free Survival analysis in all subgroups populations was in favour of Ixazomib regimen 
(HR<1), including subgroups with adverse prognostic factors and across all ages, with the exception of 
patients with baseline creatinine clearance < 60/ml/min (HR 1.032). 
Overall Survival favours the ixazomib regimen (median OS not reached in either arm; HR=0.900; 95% 
CI: 0.615, 1.316). 
The ixazomib regimen delayed the time to disease progression by approximately 6 months (median 
TTP 21.4 months in the ixazomib arm vs 15.7 months in the placebo arm; HR=0.712; CI 0.556, 0.912; 
p=0.007). 
Response to treatment was reported with statistically significant difference in favour of ixazomib 
regimen, including overall response rate CR+PR (OR= 1.44 (1.03, 2.03), p=0.035), CR+VGPR (OR= 
1.45 (1.08, 1.95), p=0.014) and CR (OR= 1.87 (1.10, 3.16), p=0.019). 
Duration of response to treatment is longer with ixazomib regimen with median DOR 20.5 months 
ixazomib (16.62, NE) vs 15.0 m placebo (11.99, NE). 
Additionally, the supportive data from the China Continuation Study provided a statistical and clinically 
significant effect in terms of PFS (HR=0.598; P=0.035).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Updated efficacy data from a second interim analysis representing the most up-to date data, showed a 
reduced difference in effect between arms in the overall ITT population for PFS, response rates and 
time to progression compared to previous analysis. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for the updated PFS 
analysis was 0.818 (0.67, 1.0) compared to 0.742 (0.587, 0.939) as seen previously.  
Although higher effects were observed in the subgroup of patients with at least 2 prior therapies, this 
observation is not supported by appropriate adjustments for multiplicity and lacks convincing biological 
and clinical plausibility. 
Based on the above, and taking into account this this is an application based on a single pivotal study, 
there is some uncertainty about the magnitude of the trestment effect. To further support the results 
obtained in the pivotal trial, the Applicant will submit the final CSR for the following studies: study 
C16010 China Continuation a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study comparing oral 
ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus placebo plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
in adult patients with relapsed and/or Refractory MM, study C16014 a phase 3, randomized, double-
blind, multicenter study comparing oral ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus placebo 
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in adult patients with newly diagnosed MM and study C16019 a 
phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of oral ixazomib maintenance therapy in 
patients with MM following autologous stem cell transplant. 
In addition, the Applicant will submit the results from NSMM-5001 study, a global, prospective, non-
interventional, observational study of presentation, treatment patterns, and outcomes in MM patients, 
which will also contribute to comprenehive efficacy data. 
In the pivotal trial, the median OS is not evaluable yet and the data is considered immature in this 
respect. The efficacy evaluation is primarily based on assessment of progression free survival and 
requires verification of the effect on overall survival. Therefore the CHMP considers that further overall 
survival analysis with longer follow up is needed from the study C16010 in order to confirm the 
favourable trend in OS with ixazomib regimen. The provision of these data is being proposed to be

imposed as a post-auhtorisation efficacy study in accordance with Article 1(2)(a) of Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 (see Annex II to the CHMP Opinion). 
Risks 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) across 360 patients treated each within the  
ixazomib and placebo regimens in the pivotal clinical trial were diarrhoea (45% vs. 39%), constipation 
(35% vs. 26%), thrombocytopenia (24% vs. 11%), peripheral neuropathy (28% vs. 21%), nausea 
(29% vs. 22%), peripheral oedema (28% vs. 20%), vomiting (23% vs. 12%), and back pain (24% vs. 
17%).  
Thrombocytopaenia is reported in 20% of patients receiving the Ixazomib regimen (vs 10% placebo) 
with the difference between the two regimens across all grades, including Grade 3/4 (17% ixazomib 
and 8% placebo). All grades of bleeding [18% ixazomib and 16% placebo], Grade 3 or higher bleeding 
[2% ixazomib and <1% placebo], and need for platelet transfusions [6% ixazomib and 5% placebo] 
were reported. Thrombocytopaenia with ixazomib regimen has a nadir at day 14-21 of the treatment 
cycle, is predictable, reversible and manageable with supportive care and platelet transfusion. 
There is an increase in gastrointestinal toxicity with ixazomib regimen compared to placebo regimen 
(74% vs 68%), specifically for diarrhoea (45% vs 39%), nausea (29% vs 22%) and vomiting (24% vs 
11%). The majority of events were of low grade and diarrhoea was the only AE that occurred as a 
grade 3 in at least 5% of patients with Ixazomib (6% ixazomib vs 3% placebo). No grade 4 events 
were reported. Nausea or vomiting did not result in drug discontinuation while diarrhoea led to 
treatment discontinuation (1 or more agents in combination) in 5 patients in ixazomib regimen (vs 3 
patients in placebo). The gastrointestinal toxicity is managed and some events may be prevented with 
supportive care (e. g. antiemetics). 
The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 28% in the ixazomib regimen and 21% in the placebo 
mostly of Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly peripheral neuropathy reported was sensory. Both 
regimens had a 2% incidence of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy events and no grade 4 events were 
reported. Discontinuations of ≥1 of the agents in the study drug regimen were infrequent (1% in each 
regimen). 
Overall, the ixazomib has significantly lower toxicity and more favourable safety profile that is superior 
to that of the available alternatives in this indication. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are no important uncertainties in the knowledge of unfavourable effects.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The gain in PFS of 5.9 months observed with ixazomib regoimen was considered clinically meaningful 
and significant, especially as it showed a consistent benefit, across subgroups, and other endpoints. 
The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was similar across treatment groups (76% v. 77% 
for placebo and ixazomib, respectively); the incidence of drug-related serious adverse events was 
similar across treatment groups (29% v. 28% for placebo and ixazomib, respectively); and there was 
no detriment in health-related quality of life based on EORTC-QLQ-C30. 
Benefit-risk balance   
The delay in disease progression observed with ixazomib is clinically relevant. Concerning the possible 
uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect, this uncertainty seems acceptable given the favourable 
toxicity profile, and considering that ixazomib is the first agent to allow oral triple combination therapy 
in this patient population, which represents a therapeutic innovation in terms of convenience for 
patients. Therefore, the benefit risk for ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy 
is considered positive, albeit the efficacy evidence is not as comprehensive as normally required. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Ixazomib an oral, highly selective and reversible proteasome inhibitor has shown a delay in disease 
progression in patients who received at least one prior therapy. Given the uncertainties about the true 
magnitude of effects, the CHMP, on the basis of Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
507/2006, and following a consultation with the applicant, proposed to grant a conditional marketing 
authorisation.  
The CHMP considered that NINLARO falls within the scope of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 
concerning conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening 
disease and is designated as an orphan medicinal product. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that requirements listed in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 507/2006 are fulfilled on the basis of the following reasons: 
a) The benefit/risk balance of the product is positive. 
The 5.9 months gain in PFS data observed in the pivotal trial C16010 is significant and clinically 
relevant in adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy despite 
the uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect.  
Together with the low toxicity of ixazomib and the benefit of the oral dosing regimen, the benefit-risk 
balance is considered positive. 
b) It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data 
The applicant will provide further comprehensive clinical data to confirm efficacy and safety of ixazomib 
in the proposed indication. More specifically the Applicant will provide:

- Study C16010 China Continuation a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study comparing 
oral ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus placebo plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone in adult patients with relapsed and/or Refractory MM 
- Study C16014 a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study comparing oral ixazomib plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus placebo plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in adult 
patients with newly diagnosed MM  
- Study C16019 a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of oral ixazomib 
maintenance therapy in patients with MM following autologous stem cell transplant. 
-Study NSMM-5001 a global, prospective, non-interventional, observational study of presentation, 
treatment patterns, and outcomes in MM patients. 
The combination of Studies C16014 and C16019 covers the entire spectrum of patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) (non-SCT and SCT).  Study C16014 investigates the same 
treatment regimen of IRd vs placebo-Rd in NDMM not eligible for SCT and the Study C16019 
investigates the effect of single agent ixazomib vs placebo as maintenance therapy in NDMM post-SCT. 
This data will provide compelling evidence of the extent of efficacy of ixazomib across the spectrum of 
patients with NDMM and will provide a data bridge to address the uncertainty about the treatment 
effect in patients with 1 prior therapy, since it will complement the evidence in the subgroup of 2-3 
prior therapies with NDMM data and will also address the uncertainty around the consistency of 
treatment effect across different treatment lines.  
The China Continuation study will provide additional confirmation of treatment benefit in RRMM. Data 
from an observational clinical study (NSMM-5001) will describe treatment patterns and patient 
outcomes such as response rates and time to next therapy in RRMM patients including patients treated 
with ixazomib and will complement the current evidence on efficacy in RRMM.    
The overall data to be accumulated in various subgroups of multiple myeloma patients is regarded 
sufficient to provide comprehensive evidence of efficacy, including in patients who have received at 
least one prior therapy. 
The above studies are ongoing and therefore do not raise concerns on their feasibility. Data is 
expected to be provided by the applicant for the China Continuation study by December 2016, for the 
study C16014 by December 2017, for the study C16019 by December 2018 and for study NSMM-5001 
by December 2019 (see Annex II). 
c) The product fulfils an unmet medical need.  
Ixazomib fulfils an unmet medical need for patients with multiple myeloma who received at least one 
prior therapy and have limited treatment alternatives.  
The efficacy benefit of the ixazomib is comparable with other therapies, but due to the significantly 
lower toxicity and the additional benefits of an oral dosing regimen, this product provides a major 
therapeutic advantage in comparison with available treatments and an important contribution to the 
care of patients with MM. The oral delivery of the ixazomib+LenDex regimen addresses multiple 
myeloma patient needs and overcome some of the significant burdens they face with currently 
available intravenous/injectable therapies.  
d) The benefits to the public health of the immediate availability of the product outweigh the risks 
inherent in the fact that additional data are still required 
Assessment report  
EMA/654545/2016  
Page 146/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Considering that ixazomib has favourable safety profile that is superior to that of the available 
alternatives, and that it is the first agent to allow oral therapy in this patient population (considerably 
improving convenience for patients), the immediate availability of Ninalro on the market outweighs the 
risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
7.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP re-examined its initial 
opinion and in its final opinion concluded by majority decision that the benefit-risk balance of Ninlaro in 
the following indication: 
‘‘NINLARO in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy’’ 
was favourable and that the application satisfied the criteria for authorisation and recommended the 
granting of the conditional marketing authorisation. 
Divergent positions to the majority recommendation are appended to this report. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

Divergent position 
This application is based on a single pivotal study (C16010). In the initial analysis provided by the 
applicant, covering 262 progression events (from a total of 722 patients), a statistically significant 
prolongation of PFS (p=0.012) was seen in the overall patient population (hazard ratio point estimate 
0.742, 95% CI 0.59, 0.94). OS was too immature to draw conclusions. In a more mature set of data 
(at a second planned analysis covering 365 progression events i.e. PFS in 50% of patients) submitted 
later in the procedure, the results were less convincing with a borderline statistical significance (hazard 
ratio point estimate 0.82; 95% CI 0.67, 1.00; p= 0.054). OS data were still immature. Although the 
first analysis had been defined a priori as primary, the second analysis provides enhanced information 
for quantification of the treatment effect. The level of statistical significance in both the initial analysis 
and the more mature analysis fell short of the usual requirement for a single pivotal trial, where the 
data are expected to be exceptionally compelling. Furthermore the data lacked internal consistency 
within the single pivotal trial. In particular the observed treatment effect was inconsistent across 
important clinical subgroups, for reasons that are not understood. 60% of patients in the trial had 
received one prior line of treatment and in this large subgroup the point estimate for hazard ratio was 
0.88 (95% CI 0.65, 1.20) in the first interim analysis and 0.99 (95% CI 0.76, 1.29) in the more 
mature second interim analysis. No clear scientific rationale could be provided to explain the estimated 
lack of efficacy in patients who had had received one prior line of treatment.  
An extension study performed in China and submitted as supporting evidence of efficacy showed a 
prolongation of PFS, but in a population of patients that differed markedly in terms of the rate of 
disease progression, probably explained by different baseline characteristics and treatment options. 
Hence, this study brings limited support to the pivotal results and does not constitute a second pivotal 
study. 
The level of evidence, considering that it comes from one single pivotal study of borderline statistical 
significance and with important internal inconsistencies, does not clearly establish a relevant benefit in 
the claimed indication, notwithstanding the relatively favourable safety profile and the practical 
advantage of being orally available.

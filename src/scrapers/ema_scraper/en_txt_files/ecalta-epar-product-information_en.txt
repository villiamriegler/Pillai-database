4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of invasive candidiasis in adults and paediatric patients aged 1 month to < 18 years (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with ECALTA should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of 
invasive fungal infections.  
Posology 
Specimens for fungal culture should be obtained prior to therapy. Therapy may be initiated before 
culture results are known and can be adjusted accordingly once they are available. 
Adult population (dosing and treatment duration) 
A single 200 mg loading dose should be administered on Day 1, followed by 100 mg daily thereafter. 
Duration of treatment should be based on the patient’s clinical response. 
In general, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture. 
There are insufficient data to support the 100 mg dose for longer than 35 days of treatment. 
Patients with renal and hepatic impairment 
No dosing adjustments are required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. No 
dosing adjustments are required for patients with any degree of renal insufficiency, including those on 
dialysis. ECALTA can be given without regard to the timing of haemodialysis (see section 5.2). 
Other special populations 
No dosing adjustments are required for adult patients based on gender, weight, ethnicity, HIV 
positivity, or elderly (see section 5.2).

Paediatric population (1 month to < 18 years) (dosing and treatment duration) 
A single loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) should be administered on Day 1 followed 
by a daily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) thereafter. 
Duration of treatment should be based on the patient’s clinical response. 
In general, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.  
The safety and efficacy of ECALTA have not been established in neonates (< 1 month old) (see 
section 4.4).  
Method of administration  
For intravenous use only. 
ECALTA should be reconstituted with water for injection to a concentration of 3.33 mg/mL and 
subsequently diluted to a concentration of 0.77 mg/mL for the final infusion solution. For a paediatric 
patient, the volume of infusion solution required to deliver the dose will vary depending on the weight 
of the child. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration (see 
section 6.6).  
It is recommended that ECALTA be administered at a rate of infusion that does not exceed 
1.1 mg/min (equivalent to 1.4 mL/min when reconstituted and diluted per instructions). Infusion 
associated reactions are infrequent when the rate of anidulafungin infusion does not exceed 
1.1 mg/min (see section 4.4). 
ECALTA must not be administered as a bolus injection. 
4.3 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Hypersensitivity to other medicinal products of the echinocandin class. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
ECALTA has not been studied in patients with Candida endocarditis, osteomyelitis or meningitis.  
The efficacy of ECALTA has only been evaluated in a limited number of neutropenic patients (see 
section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
Treatment with ECALTA in neonates (< 1 month old) is not recommended. Treating neonates requires 
consideration for coverage of disseminated candidiasis including central nervous system (CNS); 
nonclinical infection models indicate that higher doses of anidulafungin are needed to achieve 
adequate CNS penetration (see section 5.3), resulting in higher doses of polysorbate 80, a formulation 
excipient. High doses of polysorbates have been associated with potentially life-threatening toxicities 
in neonates as reported in the literature.  
There is no clinical data to support the efficacy and safety of higher doses of anidulafungin than 
recommended in 4.2. 
Hepatic effects 
Increased levels of hepatic enzymes have been seen in healthy subjects and patients treated with 
anidulafungin. In some patients with serious underlying medical conditions who were receiving 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multiple concomitant medicines along with anidulafungin, clinically significant hepatic abnormalities 
have occurred. Cases of significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, and hepatic failure were uncommon 
in clinical trials. Patients with increased hepatic enzymes during anidulafungin therapy should be 
monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing 
anidulafungin therapy. 
Anaphylactic reactions 
Anaphylactic reactions, including shock, were reported with the use of anidulafungin. If these 
reactions occur, anidulafungin should be discontinued and appropriate treatment administered. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related adverse events have been reported with anidulafungin, including rash, urticaria, 
flushing, pruritus, dyspnoea, bronchospasm and hypotension. Infusion-related adverse events are 
infrequent when the rate of anidulafungin infusion does not exceed 1.1 mg/min (see section 4.8). 
Exacerbation of infusion-related reactions by co-administration of anaesthetics has been seen in a 
non-clinical (rat) study (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of this is unknown. Nevertheless, care 
should be taken when co-administering anidulafungin and anaesthetic agents. 
Fructose content 
ECALTA contains fructose. 
Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not be given this medicine unless strictly 
necessary. 
Babies and young children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with HFI. Medicines 
(containing fructose) given intravenously may be life-threatening and should not be administered in 
this population unless there is an overwhelming clinical need and no alternatives are available.  
A detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given 
this medicinal product. 
Sodium content 
ECALTA contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial. Patients on low sodium diets can be 
informed that this medicinal product is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
ECALTA may be diluted with sodium-containing solutions (see section 6.6) and this should be 
considered in relation to the total sodium from all sources that will be administered to the patient. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Anidulafungin is not a clinically relevant substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A). Of note, in vitro studies do not fully exclude 
possible in vivo interactions.  
Drug interaction studies were performed with anidulafungin and other medicinal products likely to be 
co-administered. No dosage adjustment of either medicinal product is recommended when 
anidulafungin is co-administered with ciclosporin, voriconazole or tacrolimus, and no dosage 
adjustment for anidulafungin is recommended when co-administered with amphotericin B or 
rifampicin.

Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of anidulafungin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
ECALTA is not recommended during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the 
potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether anidulafungin is excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of anidulafungin in milk. 
A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ECALTA therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
For anidulafungin, there were no effects on fertility in studies conducted in male and female rats (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Infusion-related adverse reactions have been reported with anidulafungin in clinical studies, including 
rash, pruritus, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, hypotension (common events), flushing, hot flush, and 
urticaria (uncommon events), summarized in Table 1 (see section 4.4).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following table includes, the all-causality adverse reactions (MedDRA terms) from 840 subjects 
receiving 100 mg anidulafungin with frequency corresponding to very common (≥1/10), common 
(1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare 
(<1/10,000) and from spontaneous reports with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

The safety of anidulafungin was investigated in 68 paediatric patients (1 month to < 18 years) with 
ICC in a prospective, open-label, non-comparative paediatric study (see section 5.1). The frequencies 
of certain hepatobiliary adverse events, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased appeared at a higher frequency (7-10%) in these paediatric 
patients than has been observed in adults (2%). Although chance or differences in underlying disease

severity may have contributed, it cannot be excluded that hepatobiliary adverse reactions occur more 
frequently in paediatric patients compared to adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
As with any overdose, general supportive measures should be utilised as necessary. In case of 
overdose, adverse reactions may occur as mentioned in section 4.8. 
During clinical trials, a single 400 mg dose of anidulafungin was inadvertently administered as a 
loading dose. No clinical adverse reactions were reported. No dose limiting toxicity was observed in a 
study of 10 healthy subjects administered a loading dose of 260 mg followed by 130 mg daily; 3 of the 
10 subjects experienced transient, asymptomatic transaminase elevations ( 3 x Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN)). 
During a paediatric clinical trial, one subject received two doses of anidulafungin that were 143% of 
the expected dose. No clinical adverse reactions were reported. 
ECALTA is not dialysable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group:  – Antimycotics for systemic use, other antimycotics for systemic use. 
ATC code: JO2AX06  
Mechanism of action 
Anidulafungin is a semi-synthetic echinocandin, a lipopeptide synthesised from a fermentation product 
of Aspergillus nidulans. 
Anidulafungin selectively inhibits 1,3-β-D glucan synthase, an enzyme present in fungal, but not 
mammalian cells. This results in inhibition of the formation of 1,3--D-glucan, an essential component 
of the fungal cell wall. Anidulafungin has shown fungicidal activity against Candida species and 
activity against regions of active cell growth of the hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus. 
Activity in vitro 
Anidulafungin exhibited in-vitro activity against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei 
and C. tropicalis. For the clinical relevance of these findings see “Clinical efficacy and safety.”  
Isolates with mutations in the hot spot regions of the target gene have been associated with clinical 
failures or breakthrough infections. Most clinical cases involve caspofungin treatment. However, in 
animal experiments these mutations confer cross resistance to all three echinocandins and therefore 
such isolates are classified as echinocandin resistant until further clinical experience are obtained 
concerning anidulafungin. 
The in vitro activity of anidulafungin against Candida species is not uniform. Specifically, for 
C. parapsilosis, the MICs of anidulafungin are higher than are those of other Candida species. A 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
standardized technique for testing the susceptibility of Candida species to anidulafungin as well as the 
respective interpretative breakpoints has been established by European Committee on Antimicrobial 
Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).

Insufficient evidence 
Activity in vivo 
Parenterally administered anidulafungin was effective against Candida species in immunocompetent 
and immunocompromised mouse and rabbit models. Anidulafungin treatment prolonged survival and 
also reduced the organ burden of Candida species, when determined at intervals from 24 to 96 hours 
after the last treatment. 
Experimental infections included disseminated C. albicans infection in neutropenic rabbits, 
oesophageal/oropharyngeal infection of neutropenic rabbits with fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and 
disseminated infection of neutropenic mice with fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Candidaemia and other forms of Invasive Candidiasis 
The safety and efficacy of anidulafungin were evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3, randomised, 
double-blind, multicentre, multinational study of primarily non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia 
and a limited number of patients with deep tissue Candida infections or with abscess-forming disease. 
Patients with Candida endocarditis, osteomyelitis or meningitis, or those with infection due to 
C. krusei, were specifically excluded from the study. Patients were randomised to receive either 
anidulafungin (200 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 100 mg intravenous daily) or 
fluconazole (800 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 400 mg intravenous daily), and were 
stratified by APACHE II score (≤20 and >20) and the presence or absence of neutropenia. Treatment 
was administered for at least 14 and not more than 42 days. Patients in both study arms were permitted 
to switch to oral fluconazole after at least 10 days of intravenous therapy, provided that they were able 
to tolerate oral medicinal products and were afebrile for at least 24 hours, and that the most recent 
blood cultures were negative for Candida species. 
Patients who received at least one dose of study medicinal products and who had a positive culture for 
Candida species from a normally sterile site before study entry were included in the modified intent-
to-treat (MITT) population. In the primary efficacy analysis, global response in the MITT populations 
at the end of intravenous therapy, anidulafungin was compared to fluconazole in a pre-specified 
two-step statistical comparison (non-inferiority followed by superiority). A successful global response 
required clinical improvement and microbiological eradication. Patients were followed for six weeks 
beyond the end of all therapy. 
Two hundred and fifty-six patients, ranging from 16 to 91 years in age, were randomised to treatment 
and received at least one dose of study medication. The most frequent species isolated at baseline were 
C. albicans (63.8% anidulafungin, 59.3% fluconazole), followed by C. glabrata (15.7%, 25.4%), 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C. parapsilosis (10.2%, 13.6%) and C. tropicalis (11.8%, 9.3%) - with 20, 13 and 15 isolates of the 
last 3 species, respectively, in the anidulafungin group. The majority of patients had Apache II scores 
≤ 20 and very few were neutropenic. 
Efficacy data, both overall and by various subgroups, are presented below in Table 3.

The efficacy of anidulafungin (200 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 100 mg intravenous 
daily) in adult neutropenic patients (defined as absolute neutrophil count ≤ 500 cells/mm3, WBC 
≤ 500 cells/mm3 or classified by the investigator as neutropenic at baseline) with microbiologically 
confirmed invasive candidiasis was assessed in an analysis of pooled data from 5 prospective studies 
(1 comparative versus caspofungin and 4 open-label, non-comparative). Patients were treated for at 
least 14 days. In clinically stable patients, a switch to oral azole therapy was permitted after at least 5 
to 10 days of treatment with anidulafungin. A total of 46 patients were included in the analysis. The 
majority of patients had candidaemia only (84.8%; 39/46). The most common pathogens isolated at 
baseline were C. tropicalis (34.8%; 16/46), C. krusei (19.6%; 9/46), C. parapsilosis (17.4%; 8/46),

C. albicans (15.2%; 7/46), and C. glabrata (15.2%; 7/46). The successful global response rate at End 
of Intravenous Treatment (primary endpoint) was 26/46 (56.5%) and End of All Treatment was 24/46 
(52.2%). All-cause mortality up to the end of the study (6 Week Follow-up Visit) was 21/46 (45.7%). 
The efficacy of anidulafungin in adult neutropenic patients (defined as absolute neutrophil count 
≤ 500 cells/mm3 at baseline) with invasive candidiasis was assessed in a prospective, double-blind, 
randomized, controlled trial. Eligible patients received either anidulafungin (200 mg intravenous 
loading dose followed by 100 mg intravenous daily) or caspofungin (70 mg intravenous loading dose 
followed by 50 mg intravenous daily) (2:1 randomization). Patients were treated for at least 14 days. 
In clinically stable patients, a switch to oral azole therapy was permitted after at least 10 days of study 
treatment. A total of 14 neutropenic patients with microbiologically confirmed invasive candidiasis 
(MITT population) were enrolled in the study (11 anidulafungin; 3 caspofungin). The majority of 
patients had candidaemia only. The most common pathogens isolated at baseline were C. tropicalis 
(4 anidulafungin, 0 caspofungin), C. parapsilosis (2 anidulafungin, 1 caspofungin), C. krusei 
(2 anidulafungin, 1 caspofungin), and C. ciferrii (2 anidulafungin, 0 caspofungin). The successful 
global response rate at the End of Intravenous Treatment (primary endpoint) was 8/11 (72.7%) for 
anidulafungin and 3/3 (100.0%) for caspofungin (difference -27.3, 95% CI -80.9, 40.3); the successful 
global response rate at the End of All Treatment was 8/11 (72.7%) for anidulafungin and 3/3 (100.0%) 
for caspofungin (difference -27.3, 95% CI -80.9, 40.3). All-cause mortality up to the 6 Week 
Follow-Up visit for anidulafungin (MITT population) was 4/11 (36.4%) and 2/3 (66.7%) for 
caspofungin. 
Patients with microbiologically confirmed invasive candidiasis (MITT population) and neutropenia 
were identified in an analysis of pooled data from 4 similarly designed prospective, open-label, 
non-comparative studies. The efficacy of anidulafungin (200 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 
100 mg intravenous daily) was assessed in 35 adult neutropenic patients defined as absolute neutrophil 
count ≤ 500 cells/mm3 or WBC ≤ 500 cells/mm3 in 22 patients or classified by the investigator as 
neutropenic at baseline in 13 patients. All patients were treated for at least 14 days. In clinically stable 
patients, a switch to oral azole therapy was permitted after at least 5 to 10 days of treatment with 
anidulafungin. The majority of patients had candidaemia only (85.7%). The most common pathogens 
isolated at baseline were C. tropicalis (12 patients), C. albicans (7 patients), C. glabrata (7 patients), 
C. krusei (7 patients), and C. parapsilosis (6 patients). The successful global response rate at the End 
of Intravenous Treatment (primary endpoint) was 18/35 (51.4%) and 16/35 (45.7%) at the End of All 
Treatment. All-cause mortality by Day 28 was 10/35 (28.6%). The successful global response rate at 
End of Intravenous Treatment and End of All Treatment were both 7/13 (53.8%) in the 13 patients 
with neutropenia assessed by investigators at baseline. 
Additional Data in Patients with Deep Tissue Infections 
The efficacy of anidulafungin (200 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 100 mg intravenous 
daily) in adult patients with microbiologically confirmed deep tissue candidiasis was assessed in an 
analysis of pooled data from 5 prospective studies (1 comparative and 4 open-label). Patients were 
treated for at least 14 days. In the 4 open-label studies, a switch to oral azole therapy was permitted 
after at least 5 to 10 days of treatment with anidulafungin. A total of 129 patients were included in the 
analysis. Twenty one (16.3%) had concomitant candidaemia. The mean APACHE II score was 14.9 
(range, 2 – 44). The most common sites of infection included the peritoneal cavity (54.3%; 70 of 129),

Paediatric population 
A prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multi-national study assessed the safety and efficacy of 
anidulafungin in 68 paediatric patients aged 1 month to < 18 years with invasive candidiasis including 
candidaemia (ICC). Patients were stratified by age (1 month to < 2 years, 2 to < 5 years, and 5 to 
< 18 years) and received once daily intravenous anidulafungin (3.0 mg/kg loading dose on Day 1, and 
1.5 mg/kg daily maintenance dose thereafter) for up to 35 days followed by an optional switch to oral 
fluconazole (6-12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day). Patients were followed at 2 and 6 weeks after 
EOT.  
Among 68 patients who received anidulafungin, 64 had microbiologically confirmed Candida 
infection and were evaluated for efficacy in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population. Overall, 
61 patients (92.2%) had Candida isolated from blood only. The most commonly isolated pathogens 
were Candida albicans (25 [39.1%] patients), followed by Candida parapsilosis (17 [26.6%] patients), 
and Candida tropicalis (9 [14.1%] patients). A successful global response was defined as having both 
a clinical response of success (cure or improvement) and a microbiological response of success 
(eradication or presumed eradication). The overall rates of successful global response in the MITT 
population are presented in Table 6.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
General pharmacokinetic characteristics  
The pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin have been characterised in healthy subjects, special 
populations and patients. A low intersubject variability in systemic exposure (coefficient of variation 
~25%) was observed. The steady state was achieved on the first day after a loading dose (twice the 
daily maintenance dose). 
Distribution 
The pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin are characterised by a rapid distribution half-life (0.5-1 hour) 
and a volume of distribution, 30-50 l, which is similar to total body fluid volume. Anidulafungin is 
extensively bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins. No specific tissue distribution studies of 
anidulafungin have been done in humans. Therefore, no information is available about the penetration 
of anidulafungin into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or across the blood-brain barrier. 
Biotransformation  
Hepatic metabolism of anidulafungin has not been observed. Anidulafungin is not a clinically relevant 
substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. It is unlikely that anidulafungin will 
have clinically relevant effects on the metabolism of drugs metabolised by cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes. 
Anidulafungin undergoes slow chemical degradation at physiologic temperature and pH to a 
ring-opened peptide that lacks antifungal activity. The in vitro degradation half-life of anidulafungin 
under physiologic conditions is approximately 24 hours. In vivo, the ring-opened product is 
subsequently converted to peptidic degradants and eliminated mainly through biliary excretion. 
Elimination 
The clearance of anidulafungin is about 1 l/h. Anidulafungin has a predominant elimination half-life of 
approximately 24 hours that characterizes the majority of the plasma concentration-time profile, and a 
terminal half-life of 40-50 hours that characterises the terminal elimination phase of the profile. 
In a single-dose clinical study, radiolabeled (14C) anidulafungin (~88 mg) was administered to healthy 
subjects. Approximately 30% of the administered radioactive dose was eliminated in the faeces over 
9 days, of which less than 10% was intact drug. Less than 1% of the administered radioactive dose was 
excreted in the urine, indicating negligible renal clearance. Anidulafungin concentrations fell below 
the lower limits of quantitation 6 days post-dose. Negligible amounts of drug-derived radioactivity 
were recovered in blood, urine, and faeces 8 weeks post-dose. 
Linearity 
Anidulafungin displays linear pharmacokinetics across a wide range of once daily doses (15-130 mg). 
Special populations 
Patients with fungal infections 
The pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin in patients with fungal infections are similar to those 
observed in healthy subjects based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. With the 200/100 mg 
daily dose regimen at an infusion rate of 1.1 mg/min, the steady state Cmax and trough 
concentrations (Cmin) could reach approximately 7 and 3 mg/l, respectively, with an average 
steady state AUC of approximately 110 mgh/l.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Weight  
Although weight was identified as a source of variability in clearance in the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, weight has little clinical relevance on the pharmacokinetics of 
anidulafungin. 
Gender  
Plasma concentrations of anidulafungin in healthy men and women were similar. In multiple-dose 
patient studies, drug clearance was slightly faster (approximately 22%) in men.   
Elderly 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that median clearance differed slightly between the 
elderly group (patients ≥ 65, median CL = 1.07 l/h) and the non-elderly group (patients < 65, median 
CL = 1.22 l/h), however the range of clearance was similar. 
Ethnicity 
Anidulafungin pharmacokinetics were similar among Caucasians, Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics. 
HIV positivity 
Dosage adjustments are not required based on HIV positivity, irrespective of concomitant 
anti-retroviral therapy. 
Hepatic insufficiency 
Anidulafungin is not hepatically metabolised. Anidulafungin pharmacokinetics were examined in 
subjects with Child-Pugh class A, B or C hepatic insufficiency. Anidulafungin concentrations were not 
increased in subjects with any degree of hepatic insufficiency. Although a slight decrease in AUC was 
observed in patients with Child-Pugh C hepatic insufficiency, the decrease was within the range of 
population estimates noted for healthy subjects. 
Renal insufficiency 
Anidulafungin has negligible renal clearance (<1%). In a clinical study of subjects with mild, 
moderate, severe or end stage (dialysis-dependent) renal insufficiency, anidulafungin 
pharmacokinetics were similar to those observed in subjects with normal renal function. 
Anidulafungin is not dialysable and may be administered without regard to the timing of 
hemodialysis. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin after at least 5 daily doses were investigated in 24 
immunocompromised paediatric (2 to 11 years old) and adolescent (12 to 17 years old) patients with 
neutropenia. Steady state was achieved on the first day after a loading dose (twice the maintenance 
dose), and steady state Cmax and AUCss increase in a dose-proportional manner. Systemic exposure 
following daily maintenance dose of 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg/day in this population were comparable to 
those observed in adults following 50 and 100 mg/day, respectively. Both regimens were well-
tolerated by these patients.  
The pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin was investigated in 66 paediatric patients (1 month to 
< 18 years) with ICC in a prospective, open-label, non-comparative paediatric study following 
administration of 3.0 mg/kg loading dose and 1.5 mg/kg/day maintenance dose (see section 5.1). 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of combined data from adult and paediatric patients 
with ICC, the mean exposure parameters (AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss) at steady state in the overall paediatric 
patients across age groups (1 month to < 2 years, 2 to < 5 years, and 5 to < 18 years) were comparable 
to those in adults receiving 200 mg loading dose and 100 mg/day maintenance dose. Body weight 
adjusted CL (L/h/kg) and volume of distribution at steady state (L/kg) were similar across the age 
groups. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
In 3 month studies, evidence of liver toxicity, including elevated enzymes and morphologic 
alterations, was observed in both rats and monkeys at doses 4- to 6-fold higher than the anticipated 
clinical therapeutic exposure. In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with anidulafungin provided no 
evidence of genotoxic potential. Long-term studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the 
carcinogenic potential of anidulafungin. 
Administration of anidulafungin to rats did not indicate any effects on reproduction, including male 
and female fertility. 
Anidulafungin crossed the placental barrier in rats and was detected in foetal plasma.  
Embryo-foetal development studies were conducted with doses between 0.2- and 2-fold (rats) and 
between 1- and 4-fold (rabbits) the proposed therapeutic maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. 
Anidulafungin did not produce any drug-related developmental toxicity in rats at the highest dose 
tested. Developmental effects observed in rabbits (slightly reduced foetal weights) occurred only at the 
highest dose tested, a dose that also produced maternal toxicity. 
The concentration of anidulafungin in the brain was low (brain to plasma ratio of approximately 0.2) 
in uninfected adult and neonatal rats after a single dose. However, brain concentrations increased in 
uninfected neonatal rats after five daily doses (brain to plasma ratio of approximately 0.7). In multiple 
dose studies in rabbits with disseminated candidiasis and in mice with central nervous system (CNS) 
Candida infection, anidulafungin has been shown to reduce fungal burden in the brain. Results of 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in rabbit models of disseminated candidiasis and 
hematogenous Candida meningoencephalitis indicated that higher doses of anidulafungin were needed 
to optimally treat infections of CNS tissues relative to non-CNS tissues (see section 4.4). 
Rats were dosed with anidulafungin at three dose levels and anaesthetised within one hour using a 
combination of ketamine and xylazine. Rats in the high dose group experienced infusion-related 
reactions that were exacerbated by anaesthesia. Some rats in the mid dose group experienced similar 
reactions but only after administration of anaesthesia. There were no adverse reactions in the low-dose 
animals in the presence or absence of anaesthesia, and no infusion-related reactions in the mid-dose 
group in the absence of anaesthesia.  
Studies conducted in juvenile rats did not indicate a greater susceptibility to anidulafungin 
hepatotoxicity compared to adult animals.

1. 
What ECALTA is and what it is used for 
ECALTA contains the active substance anidulafungin and is prescribed in adults and in paediatric 
patients aged 1 month to less than 18 years to treat a type of fungal infection of the blood or other 
internal organs called invasive candidiasis. The infection is caused by fungal cells (yeasts) called 
Candida. 
ECALTA belongs to a group of medicines called echinocandins. These medicines are used to treat 
serious fungal infections. 
ECALTA prevents normal development of fungal cell walls. In the presence of ECALTA, fungal cells 
have incomplete or defective cell walls, making them fragile or unable to grow. 
2.  What you need to know before you or your child use ECALTA

Other medicines and ECALTA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any 
other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The effect of ECALTA in pregnant women is not known. Therefore, ECALTA is not recommended 
during pregnancy. Effective contraception should be used in women of childbearing age. Contact your 
doctor immediately if you become pregnant while taking ECALTA.

ECALTA contains fructose 
This medicine contains 119 mg fructose (a type of sugar) in each vial. If you have been told by your 
doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal 
product. 
If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder, you (or your 
child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose in this medicine, 
which may cause serious side effects. 
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your 
child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects 
such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. 
ECALTA contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use ECALTA 
ECALTA will always be prepared and given to you or your child by a doctor or a healthcare 
professional (there is more information about the method of preparation at the end of the leaflet in the 
section for medical and healthcare professionals only). 
For use in adults, the treatment starts with 200 mg on the first day (loading dose). This will be 
followed by a daily dose of 100 mg (maintenance dose). 
For use in children and adolescents (age from 1 month to less than 18 years), the treatment starts with 
3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) on the first day (loading dose). This will be followed by a daily dose 
of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) (maintenance dose). The dose that is given depends on the 
patient’s weight. 
ECALTA should be given to you once a day, by slow infusion (a drip) into your vein. For adults, this 
will take at least 1.5 hours for the maintenance dose and 3 hours for the loading dose. For children and 
adolescents, the infusion may take less time depending on the patient’s weight. 
Your doctor will determine the duration of your treatment and how much ECALTA you will receive 
each day and will monitor your response and condition. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, your treatment should continue for at least 14 days after the last day Candida was found in 
your blood. 
If you receive more ECALTA than you should 
If you are concerned that you may have been given too much ECALTA, tell your doctor or another 
healthcare professional immediately. 
If you forgot to use ECALTA 
As you will be given this medicine under close medical supervision, it is unlikely that a dose would be 
missed. However tell your doctor or pharmacist if you think that a dose has been forgotten. 
You should not be given a double dose by doctor. 
If you stop using ECALTA 
You should not experience any effects from ECALTA if your doctor stops ECALTA treatment. 
Your doctor may prescribe another medicine following your treatment with ECALTA to continue 
treating your fungal infection or prevent it from returning. 
If your original symptoms come back, tell your doctor or another healthcare professional immediately. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only and applies only to 
the single vial ECALTA 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion presentation: 
The contents of the vial must be reconstituted with water for injection and subsequently diluted with 
ONLY 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride for infusion or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose for infusion. The 
compatibility of reconstituted ECALTA with intravenous substances, additives, or medicines other 
than 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride for infusion or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose for infusion has not 
been established. The infusion solution must not be frozen. 
Reconstitution 
Aseptically reconstitute each vial with 30 mL water for injection to provide a concentration of 
3.33 mg/mL. The reconstitution time can be up to 5 minutes. After subsequent dilution, the solution is 
to be discarded if particulate matter or discolouration is identified.  
The reconstituted solution may be stored up to 25°C for up to 24 hours prior to further dilution. 
Dilution and infusion 
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discolouration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either 
particulate matter or discolouration is identified, discard the solution. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adult Patients 
Aseptically transfer the contents of the reconstituted vial(s) into an intravenous bag (or bottle) 
containing either 9 mg/mL (0.9%) sodium chloride for infusion or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose for 
infusion to obtain the appropriate anidulafungin concentration. The table below provides the dilution 
to a concentration of 0.77 mg/mL for the final infusion solution and infusion instructions for each 
dose.

B Infusion solution concentration is 0.77 mg/mL 
The rate of infusion should not exceed 1.1 mg/min (equivalent to 1.4 mL/min or 84 mL/hour when 
reconstituted and diluted per instructions). 
Paediatric Patients 
For paediatric patients aged 1 month to < 18 years, the volume of infusion solution required to deliver 
the dose will vary depending on the weight of the patient. The reconstituted solution must be further 
diluted to a concentration of 0.77 mg/mL for the final infusion solution. A programmable syringe or 
infusion pump is recommended. The rate of infusion should not exceed 1.1 mg/minute (equivalent 
to 1.4 mL/minute or 84 mL/hour when reconstituted and diluted per instructions).  
1.  Calculate patient dose and reconstitute vial(s) required according to reconstitution instructions 
to provide a concentration of 3.33 mg/mL  
2. Calculate the volume (mL) of reconstituted anidulafungin required:  
 Volume of anidulafungin (mL) = Dose of anidulafungin (mg)  3.33 mg/mL 
3.  Calculate the total volume of dosing solution (mL) required to provide a final concentration of 
0.77 mg/mL:  
 Total volume of dosing solution (mL) = Dose of anidulafungin (mg) ÷ 0.77 mg/mL 
4.  Calculate the volume of diluent [5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP (normal saline)] required to prepare the dosing solution: 
 Volume of diluent (mL) = Total volume of dosing solution (mL) – Volume of 
anidulafungin (mL) 
5.  Aseptically transfer the required volumes (mL) of anidulafungin and 5% Dextrose Injection, 
USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline) into an infusion syringe or IV 
infusion bag needed for administration.

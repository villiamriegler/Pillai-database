2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycaemia and 
an increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. The number of adults with T2DM 
is approximately 285 million globally, 55 million in Europe, and 37 million in North America, and is 
expected to rise to 438 million, 67 million, and 53 million, respectively, by the year 2030. 
Currently available therapy includes oral agents with different mechanisms of action such as insulin 
sensitizing agents (metformin and thiazolidinediones), agents promoting insulin secretion 
(sulphonylureas, GLP-1 analogues and DPP4-antagonists), as well as insulin.  
Patients with T2DM are at risk for the development of microvascular complications and macrovascular 
complications. While improved glycaemic control results in reduced rates of complications, especially 
microvascular, at least 44% of patients continue to fall short of treatment goals. 
Hypoglycaemia is a clinically important barrier to optimizing treatment with insulin and sulphonylureas 
(SUs), both of which are preferred second-line treatment options. Efforts by patients to lose weight as 
part of a therapeutic lifestyle program are undermined by therapies that lead to weight gain, such as 
thiazolidinediones (TZDs), insulin, and SUs. 
There is a need for novel treatment options for T2DM, due to the increasing global prevalence of the 
disease, its progressive nature which eventually requires combination therapy in most patients as well 
as the undesirable side effects of currently available therapies. 
About the product 
Dapagliflozin (BMS-512148) is a potent, competitive, reversible, highly selective and orally active 
inhibitor of the human sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), the major transporter responsible for 
the renal glucose reabsorption. It improves glycaemic control in patients with T2DM by reducing renal 
glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion (glucuresis). Dapagliflozin’s mechanism of 
action is different from and complementary to the mechanisms of currently available medicines, 
resulting in the direct, and insulin-independent, elimination of glucose by the kidney. SGLT2 is almost 
exclusively expressed in the kidney minimising the risk of off-target (i.e. non-kidney) effects. 
The recommended starting dose is 10 mg once daily for monotherapy and add-on combination therapy 
with other glucose lowering drugs including insulin. In patients with severe hepatic impairment a 
starting dose of 5 mg is recommended. If well tolerated, the dose may be increased to 10 mg  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Marketing Authorisation application is a full, stand alone application in accordance with Directive 
2001/83/EC Article 8 (3).

The dapagliflozin clinical development program was designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of 
dapagliflozin in a wide range of subjects with T2DM. The program included both placebo-controlled and 
active comparator studies (comparators were metformin XR and glipizide) in drug-naïve subjects at an 
early stage of disease and subjects who require additional therapy after failure to reach adequate 
glycaemic control with their current regimen, including oral anti-diabetic agents or insulin at a later 
stage of the disease. The clinical development program also examined the persistent loss of calories in 
the urine due to glucosuria and the resulting potential for weight loss with a reduction in total body fat. 
The clinical studies did not include subjects with severe renal impairment since glycaemic efficacy was 
not expected in the absence of adequate renal function. 
The development programme of dapagliflozin complies with the CHMP guideline “Note for Guidance on 
the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the treatment of diabetes mellitus 
(CPMP/EWP/1080/00)”. This guideline is currently under revision. This application is supported by an 
extensive clinical program including 11 Phase 3 studies whereof 7 are considered pivotal for the 
proposed indication.  
Scientific advice was provided by the CHMP in February 2008 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/485029/2007) on 
the clinical aspects of the development program with main focus on the Phase 3 program. The 
importance of investigating the lower dose range in the Phase 3 studies was pointed out. Potential 
safety issues were also discussed such as the risk of electrolyte imbalances. The need to include 
sufficient numbers of patients from the EU was stressed as well as the need to include elderly patients. 
The design of study DC1690C00006 to support the add-on indication to insulin was discussed and 
points were made on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The proposed investigation of changes in 
body weight/body composition was also discussed and the applicant’s strategy was endorsed. Further, 
risk mitigation actions proposed by the applicant were discussed and the proposals were generally 
found acceptable. The advice given has been followed in all essential parts. 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (P/100/2010) and a waiver for children aged below 10 years of age 
have been agreed for dapagliflozin with the PDCO. A deferral to complete the PIP has been granted 
until September 2017. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The application relates to Forxiga, 5 and 10 mg film-coated tablets, containing the active substance 
dapagliflozin propanediol.  
The excipients used in the formulation are common Ph. Eur. Excipients apart from the coating agent. 
The list of ingredients is described as follow: microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, lactose 
anhydrous, silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate for the core tablets, and opadry II yellow for the 
coating. 
The tablets are kept in Aluminium- Aluminium (Alu/Alu) blisters. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
An in-house monograph was submitted for dapagliflozin propanediol, since there is no monograph in 
the Ph. Eur. Complete scientific data was submitted in module 3. 
The structure of dapagliflozin is depicted below:  
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 10/170 
 
 
The active substance is a white to off-white powder, and physico-chemical characteristics such as 
solubility (soluble in many polar solvents), pKa, partition coefficient, hygroscopicity (non-hygroscopic), 
specific optical rotation (five stereogenic centres), Xray diffraction (crystalline powder), polymorphism 
(single polymorphic form observed) and melting point were adequately described.  
Manufacture 
The manufacture of the final active substance was satisfactorily described including a flow-chart. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the synthesis of the active substance was sufficiently 
detailed including quantities and operating conditions. The overall synthetic sequence has remained 
the essentially same throughout development; however in order to achieve a robust manufacturing 
process, some changes have been made mainly in relation to reagents, solvents, purification 
procedures. The information provided in the development history highlights the changes made in the 
individual manufacturing steps in order to either improve process efficiency, avoiding the generation of 
potential genotoxic impurities and improving the overall quality of the active substance. This indicated 
that the applicant seems to have a good understanding of the process and their product.  
The starting materials, reagents and solvents used for the synthesis of the active substance were 
adequately characterised and justified. The starting materials mark the points in the synthesis beyond 
which cGMP and regulatory change control were applied. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates were adequately presented as well as the analytical methods 
used. 
Impurities including residual solvents have been well characterised and controlled during the 
manufacturing process. 
To demonstrate process reproducibility and performance, the potential variables of input materials and 
process parameters that may have an impact on the quality of each intermediate and dapagliflozin 
propanediol were evaluated. 
Based on the risk assessment and other development work, the applicant stated there were no critical 
process parameters (CPPs) identified for the manufacturing process.  
Satisfactory In-process control (IPC) tests were applied throughout the manufacturing process to 
ensure the quality of dapagliflozin propanediol. The acceptance criteria established for reaction 
completion of each process step were based on development and manufacturing experience gained 
during the production of dapagliflozin propanediol to date.  
According to the applicant batch analysis data demonstrated the consistency in the quality of batches 
of dapagliflozin propanediol. No data has been presented with regard to process validation. However, 
this was considered acceptable since dapagliflozin propanediol is a fully synthetic compound and a non-
sterile active substance.

Discussion of Process Development Utilizing Quality by Design Concepts  
The applicant provided the following general information about its development and control strategy: 
• 
• 
• 
Appropriate critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance were identified on the basis 
of their potential impact on the safety and efficacy of the drug product and thus the patient. 
A collective risk assessment was performed to define quality attributes of the starting materials 
and process intermediates which have the potential to impact the CQAs of the active substance. In 
summary, potential variability in the starting materials was understood and appropriate 
specifications have been established.  
Then individual risk assessment for each step of the process was carried out using a Failure Mode 
Analysis (FMEA) to identify process parameters that could impact the quality attribute of the 
intermediates and may directly or indirectly impact the CQAs of the active substance. These 
process parameters were designated as potential CPPs and were studied further using univariate 
and/or multivariate experiments, as appropriate, to ascertain interdependence of process 
parameters, if any, and to establish Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs). PARs have been 
established for parameters which may impact the quality attributes with appropriate control 
strategies for the commercial manufacture of dapagliflozin propanediol. 
• 
Impurities attributed to the starting materials were also controlled. The quality attributes of the 
intermediates from each step that could impact the next process step or intermediate were 
identified with defined control strategies.  
Based on the control strategy for the active substance, it was concluded that no process parameters 
were identified as high risk. In conclusion, the predefined quality of dapagliflozin propanediol was 
achieved and assured by the design of a reproducible and robust manufacturing process with 
established controls. A set of active substance specifications has been established that verifies the 
CQAs and other quality attributes of dapagliflozin propanediol.  
Elucidation of Structure and other Characteristics  
The structure of dapagliflozin propanediol was confirmed by the route of synthesis and by the following 
analytical methods: elemental analysis, Ultra-violet (UV)-Vis spectroscopy, Infra-red (IR) spectroscopy, 
Raman spectroscopy, one- and two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR, 
Mass Spectrometry (MS electrospray), and by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The physical 
characteristics have also been determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies. 
The presence of a stable polymorphic form has been confirmed through analysis on numerous batches 
(>30), including four commercial batches. This crystalline form remains stable during manufacture and 
stability studies.  
The non-hygroscopicity of dapagliflozin propanediol was also confirmed. 
The particle size of the active substance was consistently produced by the manufacturing process.  
Dapagliflozin is a chiral molecule with five stereogenic centers. An evaluation was carried out to assess 
the probability of epimerisation of the stereogenic centers during the synthesis. Results showed that 
epimerisation was highly unlikely.

Impurities  
An extensive discussion on impurities including organic impurities, inorganic impurities, potential 
genotoxic impurities, and residual solvents was presented. Impurities were found below the limits 
authorised by the ICH Q3A guidelines and the residual level of solvents observed was well below the 
ICH limits (ICH Q3C (R4): Impurities: Residual Solvents). 
Specification 
Adequate specification was presented and the following parameters were evaluated: appearance 
(visual), colour (visual), identification (IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), propylene glycol (GC), water 
content (Karl-Fisher), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and particle size (Laser Light 
Scattering).  
The analytical methods were described and satisfactory validated.  
Analytical data for 25 batches manufactured with the proposed commercial process have been 
provided. Seven of these batches were of full production scale. Results were found satisfactory. The 
specification was adequately justified and in line with the corresponding ICH guidelines on impurities 
and residual solvents. 
Container closure system 
Dapagliflozin propanediol was packaged and stored in closed, double, antistatic-treated, low-density 
polyethylene bags (LDPE) placed in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum with a secure fitting lid. 
A declaration of compliance with EU food contact directive 2002/72/EC and its subsequent 
amendments was provided for the PE bag primary packaging. Specification for the LDPE-bag, including 
requirements for identification (IR) and physical/dimensional characteristics was provided. 
Stability 
Stability studies were conducted on three primary batches of the active substance kept in a packaging 
similar to the commercial packaging under the following ICH conditions: 24 months under long term, 
25 °C and 60% RH and intermediate 30 °C and 65% RH, 6 months under accelerated 40 °C and 75% 
RH and stress studies including photostability). 
The parameters tested included: appearance, color, identity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), organic impurities 
(HPLC), polymorphic identity (X-ray powder diffraction), water content and propylene glycol content. 
The analytical methods used during stability studies were the same as the ones used for the control of 
the active substance apart from the X-ray method that was presented separately.  
Results of the stability study were found well within the specification limits for all the conditions. 
Trends in the long-term, intermediate and accelerated stability data so far indicate no degradation of 
the active substance.   
Based on the stability study data presented, the re-test period proposed by the applicant when stored 
in the primary packaging can be approved.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product

The 5 mg tablets are yellow, biconvex round, film-coated tablet with “5” debossed on one side and 
“1427” on the other side. The 10 mg tablets are yellow biconvex diamond, film-coated tablet with “10” 
debossed on one side and “1428” on the other side. The tablets are dose proportional. 
The excipients used for the core tablets are described in the Ph.Eur and commonly used for solid oral 
dosage forms: microcrystalline cellulose (diluent), anhydrous lactose (diluent), crospovidone 
(disintegrant), silicon dioxide (glidant), magnesium stearate (lubricant). For the film-coating: Opadry II 
yellow and purified water (solvent) were used. Opadry is not described in any Pharmacopoeia, but all 
the individual ingredients (Polyvinyl Alcohol-Part Hydrolyzed, Titanium Dioxide, Polyethylene Glycol 
3350, Talc, and Iron Oxide Yellow, NF/E172) are either described in Ph.Eur or EC Food Directive.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The pharmaceutical development of the dapagliflozin film-coated tablets included quality risk 
assessments and design of experiments (DoE) to understand the quality of the input raw materials 
required for a robust formulation and the impact of manufacturing process parameters on the critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) of the drug product. The purpose of the development studies was to gain 
knowledge about the product and the manufacturing process. But no design space approach was 
claimed and the control strategy of the finished product remained a conventional testing at the end of 
the manufacture.  
Because the drug loading for dapagliflozin was low , uniform distribution of dapagliflozin in the pre-
blend was important to attain reproducible tablet content. 
A quality target product profile (QTPP) was presented comprising regular requirements for tablets such 
as tablet strengths, general types of packages, compliance with standard tablet requirements (e.g. 
dissolution, content uniformity), impurity level to be below the qualified level, target patient population 
(adults) and route of administration. 
The key Development Challenges were: 
   Polymorphic form: Transformation from the crystalline form to amorphic anhydrate may 
occur upon long exposure to high temperature. This may affect assay, content uniformity, 
dissolution and impurity content and was avoided by environmental controls on storage and 
shipment of the active substance. Also comparative in-vitro dissolution and bioequivalence 
studies were performed comparing heat stressed versus non-heat stressed tablets where the 
tablets were demonstrated to be similar. These results showed that the changes of 
polymorphic form of the active substance had no impact on drug product performance and 
quality. 
   Control of particle size: Particle size distribution may affect content uniformity. Therefore, 
appropriate particle size control at the final manufacturing step of the active substance was 
established.  
   Poor flow, cohesive, and sticky nature of the active substance: Assay and content 
uniformity may be affected therefore all the properties above were controlled by the excipients 
used and the choice of the manufacturing process. 
   Targeted low dose: Content uniformity may be affected. Process was developed to ensure 
uniformity of both the preblend and the final blend. 
   Susceptibility of the active substance to oxidative degradation in the presence of 
excipients and moisture: Assay and degradation products may be affected.  Compatible 
excipients were selected and water content was controlled to ensure acceptable drug product

stability. Moisture protective primary packages and/or the use of dessiccant were proposed for 
the commercial tablets. 
Active Substance 
Dapagliflozin propanediol is a solvate containing 1:1:1 ratio of the dapagliflozin, (S)-(+)-1,2-
propanediol, and water.  It is a white to off-white powder, non-hygroscopic. It is a BCS Class III drug. 
Stability and compatibility with the selected excipients were evaluated and found satisfactory. 
The quality attributes of the active substance that have the potential to impact the drug product 
quality and manufacturing process were studied. 
Excipients 
The core tablet excipients chosen for the commercial formulation were conventional and the amounts 
per tablet were within their typical levels of usage in solid dosage forms.  
Further assurance of excipient compatibility for the core tablet and film coating materials was 
confirmed by stability data at long-term and accelerated storage conditions. 
Formulation Development  
The formulation development was extensively presented including the choice and level of the 
excipients in the different clinical formulations and a dry granulation manufacturing process was used 
throughout the formulation development. Dissolution profiles of the clinical formulations and the final 
formulation were found comparable, and the changes to the formulation were not expected to affect 
the dissolution and the absorption of the drug product. 
The target levels and acceptable ranges for the composition of dapagliflozin film-coated tablets 
proposed for commercial use were provided and satisfactorily justified. It consisted of a range of 
material levels that were demonstrated to have no impact on drug product quality and performance; 
thus, showing formulation robustness. 
Manufacturing Process Development  
A FMEA was performed to quantify the level of risk remaining in the dapagliflozin tablet manufacturing 
process and it was demonstrated that the process was well under control.  
Container Closure System 
Three container closure systems were evaluated together with bulk package: 
•  High density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a two-piece child resistant, continuous thread 
(CRCT) polypropylene closure having an aluminium-foil induction seal and a silica gel canister 
desiccant. 
•  Aluminium-Aluminium (Alu-Alu) blister packs 
• 
• 
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-Aclar blister packs 
For bulk packaging, the tablets were packaged using an inner low density polyethylene (LDPE) 
bag and an outer aluminium foil bag. Desiccants were placed between the two bags and then 
sealed.

Stability data for dapagliflozin film-coated tablets in all three container closure systems were found 
acceptable; however, only the Alu-Alu blister packs were evaluated for commercialization. The stability 
of the tablets in the bulk packaging was also acceptable. 
Microbiological Attributes  
The long-term stability data indicates the tablets were not susceptible to microbial growth as 
demonstrated by microbial test.  
In conclusion, a thorough pharmaceutical development was made where the parameters affecting the 
quality of the final film-coated tablets were evaluated. 
Adventitious agents 
The magnesium stearate used was of vegetable origin. The anhydrous lactose used was sourced from 
bovine milk that was suitable for human consumption. Declaration from the supplier of anhydrous 
lactose was provided. Therefore no TSE risk was foreseen and the information was in line with the TSE 
guideline (EMA/410/01 rev 3). 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of the manufacture of the final blend intermediate, tablet 
compression and film-coating with a coating suspension consisting of the Opadry II material in water. 
Adequate process controls for the critical steps and intermediates in the manufacture of dapagliflozin 
film-coated tablets were presented and justified.  
Process Validation and/or Evaluation  
A process validation protocol for three consecutive batches for each tablet strength was presented and 
was considered acceptable. 
Product specification 
Specification for the Dapagliflozin film-coated tablets included the following parameters: description 
(visual), identification (IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), uniformity of dosage 
units content uniformity (PhEur.), disintegration test (PhEur.) water content (Karl-Fisher),  
Analytical methods were adequately described and where applicable validated.  
Batch results for both tablet strengths (clinical, registrational/stability, and commercial scale batches) 
manufactured at the registered sites) were in line with the proposed specification. 
Characterisation of Impurities  
Impurities in the drug product that were carried over from the active substance were discussed as well 
as their structure, origin and degradation pathways. Limits of the impurities were below the ICH limits 
and did not raise any safety concern.  
The proposed specification and their analytical procedures were satisfactory for the control of the drug 
product. The tests and limits were well justified.

Container closure system  
The proposed commercial presentation for dapagliflozin film-coated tablets, 5 mg and 10 mg was an 
Aluminium/Aluminium (Alu/Alu) blister  The blister components were in compliance with the EU 
directives for materials that are intended to come into contact with food. The PVC film which comes in 
contact with the drug product complies with the Ph.Eur.3.1.11. The specification for the package 
components comprised tests for appearance, identification (IR for the blister cavity) and area weight. 
Representative IR spectra were provided and acceptable. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies were conducted on three batches of film-coated tablets (pilot or production size) for 
each strength kept in the alu/alu blisters intended for marketing. The batches were stored under ICH 
conditions (long term, intermediate, accelerated, stress-freeze thaw, photostability, open-dish 
conditions) 
Matrix design used for dapagliflozin film-coated tablets stored under ICH conditions: 5°C, 25°C/60%RH 
and 30°C/75%RH included a one-third reduction at 3, 6, 9, 15, 18 and 30 months testing with full 
testing at annual time points (12, 24 and 36 months). 
Samples were exposed to temperatures between -20°C ± 5°C and 40°C ± 2°C/75%RH ± 5% RH for 24 
hours each, for a duration of two weeks (seven complete cycles) 
Parameters tested at long-term (5°C, 25 °C and 30°C) and accelerated (40°C) conditions were 
appearance, potency, impurity, water, disintegration time, hardness, dissolution, microbiological 
quality, identity and uniformity of dosage units. Parameters tested under all other conditions were 
appearance, potency, impurity, disintegration, hardness and dissolution.  
Analytical methods were described and validated, and identical to the ones used for the control of the 
finished product. 
No out of specification results were seen under any storage condition. The results indicated that 
Dapagliflozin Film-Coated Tablet was stable under long-term conditions. There were little or no change 
observed in any attribute tested in the freeze/thaw study indicating that the tablets were not sensitive 
to brief low and high temperature excursions. In the open dish study essentially no significant change 
was observed. In the photostability study there were little to no change observed in any attribute 
tested indicating that the tablets were not sensitive to light. 
In the bulk package study no major change could be observed.  
Based on the stability data, the proposed shelf-life can be supported in line with the conditions of 
storage specified in the SmPC.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development 
Dapagliflozin propanediol is a solvate containing a 1:1:1 ratio of dapagliflozin, propanediol and water. 
Characterisation of the active substance and its manufacture have been well detailed. This is a chiral 
molecule with five stereogenic centres, and only one polymorphic form was observed. Dapagliflozin is 
not light sensitive and the proposed re-test period can be approved. 
Forxiga is formulated as immediate-release 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets. The manufacture 
consists of a dry granulation process followed by compression and film-coating and has been 
adequately described. The applicant has provided extensive development studies for the active 
substance and the finished product employing Quality by Design strategies. However no Design space 
was claimed and the control strategy follows the traditional approach using end product testing. The 
drug product is well controlled.  Stability has been studied under ICH conditions and the proposed 
shelf-life can be granted.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of the medicinal product has been adequately demonstrated (both for the active substance 
dapagliflozin propanediol and the drug product 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets). There are no 
remaining issues from the quality point of view that could impact on the safety or the efficacy of the 
drug product.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant conducted a comprehensive non-clinical development programme to support the chronic 
use of dapagliflozin in humans. This programme is in general agreement with the applicable scientific 
guidelines. All main non-clinical toxicity studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. In addition, 
non-GLP studies were conducted too but were not considered to compromise the scientific integrity or 
affect the experimental results. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacology programme was considered to be adequate. The overall results of these studies are 
reported below. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Internal quantitative RT-PCR, Northern blot and in situ hybridization studies as well as some external 
reports showed SGLT2 to be selectively expressed in the kidney, although other external reports 
suggest a broader pattern of tissue distribution. Other sodium glucose co-transporters are present in 
the gut, heart, skeletal muscle and other tissues. 
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 18/170 
 
 
 
Studies in normal and diabetic animal models have demonstrated that parenteral delivery of the non-
selective SGLT inhibitor Phlorizin leads to the excretion of glucose in the urine, and only in diabetic 
animal models lower blood glucose in a manner independent of insulin secretion or insulin action, 
without hypoglycaemia. 
Primary pharmacodynamic in vitro 
The Applicant demonstrated dapagliflozin’s activity towards human, rat and mouse SGLT2 in vitro 
(artificial overexpression of the respective transporters in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells) and 
thereby also verified the suitability of the rodent models used for further studies. The potency for 
human SGLT2 inhibition was around 0.2 nM; for the rat and mouse SGLT2 it was slightly lower (3.0 
and 2.3 nM, respectively). High selectivity (around 1200 for humans, based on EC50) of SGLT2 
inhibition over SGLT1 inhibition was also demonstrated in vitro. The selectivity was markedly lower in 
rodents (around 200 in rats and 130 in mice) but still considered sufficiently high to allow meaningful 
extrapolation of animal findings to humans. 
The Applicant also confirmed restricted expression in the kidney (renal proximal tubule) in studies 
using PCR and in situ hybridisation because individual reports suggested a wider expression.  
The Applicant investigated metabolites of dapagliflozin for any action on SGLT2 or SGLT1. All 
metabolites were at least 300-fold less potent than dapagliflozin. No metabolite had a detectable 
activity towards SGLT1. 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
In vivo primary pharmacodynamic studies with dapagliflozin were carried out in single-dose, dose-
ranging studies in non-diabetic and diabetic rats or mice in order to evaluate the potency, SGLT2-
specificity and duration of action in stimulating urinary glucose excretion, and to describe the 
secondary consequences of urinary glucose excretion, such as changes in urine volume or blood or 
plasma glucose effects. Subsequently a multiple-dose study was carried out to evaluate the ability of 
dapagliflozin to have sustained effects on urinary glucose excretion, urine volume, and fasting plasma 
glucose in diabetic rats over a two-week dosing period. 
Dapagliflozin increased renal glucose excretion in (healthy, non-diabetic) experimental animals. This 
was accompanied, by osmotic diuresis as measured by increased urine flow. An oral glucose tolerance 
test was also performed showing that dapagliflozin was able to significantly reduce glucose area under 
the curve (AUC), compared to vehicle treatment. A study in knock-out mice lacking the gene for SGLT2 
revealed that SGLT2 is indeed the main target for dapagliflozin at least at lower doses. This study also 
demonstrated the reversibility of dapagliflozin’s action towards SGLT2. 
As in healthy animals, dapagliflozin led to increased renal glucose excretion and urine flow in ZDF rats. 
However, this renal glucose loss also led to a counter-regulatory endogenous glucose production and 
increased nutrient (i.e. food) intake. The advantage of these counter-regulatory mechanisms was that 
dapagliflozin decreased the blood glucose level but did not cause hypoglycaemia. The renal glucose 
loss was even over-compensated by increased food intake since weight gain was increased in ZDF rats 
after repeated doses of dapagliflozin as compared to controls. In another T2DM model, the DIO (diet-
induced obese) rat, no weight gain in response to dapagliflozin was observed. As in healthy animals 
dapagliflozin did not cause hypoglycaemia in diabetic animals but could lower blood glucose level 
(starved and post-prandial) and HbA1c over a prolonged time when administered repeatedly. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The secondary PD programme encompassed in vitro studies to investigate dapagliflozin’s action on 
glucose carriers other than SGLT1 and SGLT2 and in vivo studies in special animal models to 
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 19/170 
 
 
investigate some mechanistic aspects of dapagliflozin’s action in more detail, e.g. single nephron GFR 
in Wistar rats, body composition in DIO rats and glucose balance in ZDF rats.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics in vitro 
3 studies measured the action of dapagliflozin on the sodium myoinositol transporter (artificially 
overexpressed in CHO cells) and on the glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT2 and GLUT4 (measured as 
glucose uptake in cultured 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes, human adipocytes and HepG2 human 
hepatocarcinoma cells). These transporters were only influenced by dapagliflozin in the micromolar 
range, i.e. far beyond the nanomolar range needed to block SGLT2. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
A renal micropuncture study in diabetic rats was conducted to detect any potential beneficial effect of 
dapagliflozin on early diabetic nephropathy since proximal-tubular reabsorption of sodium and glucose 
and their feedback on GFR have been discussed to play a role in early diabetic nephropathy. 
Dapagliflozin corrected the enhanced single nephron GRF by limiting the reabsorption of glucose and 
sodium in the proximal tubule. Total GFR was not changed.  
Body composition was studied in DIO (diet-induced obese) rats. In these animals, in contrast to the 
ZDF rats, body weight was reduced in dapagliflozin-treated (ad libidum fed) animals. This weight loss 
was not only due to water loss but body fat mass was also reduced by dapagliflozin treatment.  
Furthermore, the Applicant conducted glucose clamp studies to measure insulin resistance and islet 
function in ZDF rats previously treated with dapagliflozin for 34 days. Dapagliflozin was absent during 
the clamp. Improvements in insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were observed in the 
dapagliflozin-treated animals, most likely due to improved glycaemic control in the dapagliflozin 
treated ZDF rats.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Non-clinical studies on cardiovascular safety did not identify any concern for human safety. The in vivo 
studies were performed at high exposure multiples. 
No specific safety pharmacology studies assessing effects on the CNS or the respiratory system were 
performed. The Applicant referred to the absence of any effects in toxicity studies with high exposure 
multiples. Toxicity studies in dogs included further endpoints addressing respiratory effect as well as 
neurophysiological functions. In addition, distribution studies in rats demonstrated low distribution of 
dapagliflozin to the brain. The absence of dedicated safety pharmacology studies addressing the CNS 
and the respiratory system was considered justified by the CHMP. 
In parallel with testing of dapagliflozin, its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite was evaluated in a secondary 
pharmacology screen consisting of >300 in vitro radioligand binding and enzyme activity assays. 
Similar to dapagliflozin, the 3-O-glucuronide metabolite had no significant activity (all < 50% 
inhibition) at a free drug concentration of 10 μM in any of the >300 assays, indicating that there were 
no identified off-target liabilities for parent or its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed in animals. The Applicant stated that PD 
interactions were studied during the clinical development program. This was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. The in vitro 
biotransformation of dapagliflozin was investigated in mice, rats, monkeys and humans. The overall 
results of these investigations are reported below. 
Methods of analysis 
Validated LC-MS/MS methods were used to determine concentrations of either dapagliflozin or 
dapagliflozin and its metabolites, desethyl dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, in rat liver 
homogenate and plasma from mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey.

Absorption of dapagliflozin after oral administration was rapid, with Tmax values being 1.7 ± 2.0 hours, 
0.6 ± 0.4 hours, and 1.9 ± 1.8 hours in rats, dogs, and monkeys, respectively. The absolute 
bioavailability of dapagliflozin was high in rats receiving a 1 mg/kg dose (84 ± 21%) and dogs 
receiving a 6.6 mg/kg dose (83 ± 2%), indicating that it is well-absorbed in these species. 
Bioavailability was lower in monkeys receiving a 6 mg/kg dose (25 ± 2%). 
In a mass balance study with [14C]dapagliflozin in human subjects receiving a single 50-mg oral dose, 
75% of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine, indicating that oral absorption was at least 75% in 
humans. This is consistent with the high (~76%) oral absolute bioavailability observed in humans. 
These data show a high oral bioavailability of dapagliflozin in humans and animals except monkeys, the 
reason for the low oral availability in monkeys is not clear. 
In vitro data indicated that dapagliflozin is a substrate of P-gp. However, the membrane permeability 
of dapagliflozin was high and oral absorption was good in most species, indicating that the action of P-
gp is unlikely to play a limiting role in the oral absorption of dapagliflozin.

Distribution 
Distribution of dapagliflozin into red blood cells after a two-hour incubation was low, at 10 to 23% in 
rat, dog, and monkey and 37% in human. In vitro plasma protein binding of dapagliflozin was similar 
at 0.5 and 5 μg/mL; the overall mean binding was 93, 95, 94, 93 and 91% in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, 
and human plasma, respectively. 
The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) for dapagliflozin was moderate in rats, dogs, and 
monkeys (1.6, 0.8, and 0.8 L/kg, respectively) following intra-arterial or IV doses of 1, 6.6, and 6 
mg/kg, indicative of some extra vascular distribution. 
The tissue distribution of radioactivity was initially studied in pigmented Long-Evans rats receiving a 
single oral dose of [14C]dapagliflozin (25 mg/kg, 100 μCi/kg) using tissue combustion and liquid 
scintillation counting techniques. No retention of dapagliflozin in pigmented skin was observed. A more 
detailed tissue distribution study was conducted following a single oral dose of [14C]dapagliflozin (~23 
mg/kg, ~130 μCi/kg) to adult male and female albino Sprague Dawley rats using quantitative whole-
body autoradiography. Tissue-to-blood AUCINF ratios were highest for intestine and renal cortex, 
ranging from 6.21 to 15.2. The lowest concentrations were observed in the tissues of bone and the 
lens of the eye, with tissue-to-blood AUCINF ratios of 0.075 and 0.158; the brain-to-blood ratio was 
0.250 to 0.335.  
In pregnant Sprague Dawley rats receiving [14C]dapagliflozin, the distribution of radioactivity into 
maternal and fetal tissues, including placenta, was rapid. Fetal blood radioactivity AUC(INF) was 64% 
of the corresponding maternal blood radioactivity AUC(INF). Fetal tissue radioactivity AUC(INF) values 
were 80 to 129% of maternal blood radioactivity AUC(INF). These results indicate that dapagliflozin 
and/or its metabolites cross the placenta in rats resulting in fetal exposure. In nursing rats receiving 
dapagliflozin, the compound was detected in rat milk 2 hours after dosing at concentration around 
50% of that in plasma. 
Metabolism 
The in vitro metabolic fate of [14C]dapagliflozin was studied in liver microsomes and hepatocytes from 
mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, as well as in S9 fraction from Aroclor 1254-treated rat liver. 
In vivo biotransformation studies in mice, rats, dogs, and humans, as well as bile duct-cannulated 
(BDC) rats, were conducted after oral administration of [14C]dapagliflozin followed by profiling and 
structural elucidation of metabolites in bile (in rat only), plasma, urine, and feces.  
Primary biotransformation reactions of dapagliflozin included glucuronidation to form dapagliflozin 3-O-
glucuronide (BMS-801576, m15, the overall most-abundant metabolite), dapagliflozin 2-O-glucuronide 
(BMS-805525, m10), and another dapagliflozin O-glucuronide (m13, the exact site of conjugation for 
m13 was not determined); oxidative dealkylation to form desethyl dapagliflozin (BMS-511926, m8); 
and oxidation at various positions of the molecule to form benzylic hydroxy-dapagliflozin (BMS-
639432, m12), hydroxy-dapagliflozin-1, -2, and -3 (m4, m9, and m15a, respectively), oxo-
dapagliflozin-1, -2, and -3 (m11, m14, and m16, respectively), and dapagliflozin carboxylic acid (m7). 
Combinations of these reactions produced desethyl dapagliflozin glucuronide-1, -2, and -3 (m2, m3, 
and m6a, respectively) and hydroxy-dapagliflozin O-glucuronide-1 and -2 (m5 and m6, respectively). 
There were no unique human metabolites. 
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 22/170 
 
 
There was a markedly different metabolism pattern in animals and humans. Although the nature of 
metabolites formed was similar, the amount of individual metabolites markedly differed. In particular, 
humans formed high amounts of directly glucuronidated dapagliflozin (dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, 
i.e. glucuronidation without prior phase I reactions). This dapagliflozin glucuronidate was present in the 
plasma in approximately the same amount as native dapagliflozin. Other metabolites played a minor 
role. In animals, less than half of dapagliflozin was metabolized but the metabolites formed were much 
more heterogeneous than in humans. Most metabolites were oxidation products of dapagliflozin, and 
part of them was consecutively also glucuronidated. This means that the main human metabolite was 
formed only in small amounts in animal, making toxicological qualification difficult. The Applicant 
stated that in single dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs the exposure of the animals towards 
dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide was similar to the human exposure under therapeutic conditions. No 
information about repeated-dose toxicity of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is therefore available. 
However, mere glucuronidation of a given compound is not expected to increase its toxicity. Usually 
the glucuronidated product is no longer active on the target structure of the native compound (as it is 
the case here) and becomes rapidly excreted (via kidney in the present case) without further action in 
the organism. Therefore, this major human metabolite dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is not considered 
posing a toxicological concern.

In general, >90% of the administered dose were recovered in all species tested (mouse, rat, dog) 
including humans. In animals, dapagliflozin excretion was proximally equally distributed between urine 
and faeces; in humans urine was the predominant route (around 75%). This was due to the major 
human metabolite dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide that was excreted renally. In rats it was shown that 
biliary clearance and not unabsorbed drug was responsible for the recovery of dapagliflozin in the 
faeces. 
The difference in metabolism of dapagliflozin between humans and animals leads also to differences in 
its excretion since the main human metabolite dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mainly excreted via 
urine. Hence, a higher proportion of dapagliflozin is finally excreted via the kidney than via the bile and 
in the feces in humans, but, as in animals, the main path of dapagliflozin’s inactivation is by 
metabolism in the liver. Hence, liver insufficiency appears more likely to increase dapagliflozin 
exposure than kidney insufficiency.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Dapagliflozin is a substrate for various CYP enzymes (highest turnover with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, 
and CYP3A4). However, in humans, less than 10% of dapagliflozin’s dose is eliminated via pathways 
involving oxidative metabolism. Dapagliflozin was also a substrate for various UGT enzymes (UGT1A9, 
UGT2B4, and UGT2B7). In humans, dapagliflozin’s elimination is highly dependent on the formation of 
dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is mediated by UGT1A9. In vitro data suggest that the inhibition 
of UGT1A9 can impact on dapagliflozin’s elimination: Mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT1A9 and 
UGT2B) and niflumic acid (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a UGT1A9-specific inhibitor) 
inhibited the formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide by human liver microsomes (IC50 = 1.17 and 
0.091 μM, respectively) and by recombinant UGT1A9 (IC50 = 0.426 and 0.067 μM, respectively). In 
addition, the formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide in human kidney microsomes was inhibited by 
niflumic acid and propofol (a high-affinity UGT1A9 substrate) (IC50 = 0.40 and 133 μM, respectively).  
Dapagliflozin was a weak substrate for the P-gp transporter. The failure of dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin 
3-O-glucuronide to inhibit P-gp suggests that co-administration of dapagliflozin will not affect the 
absorption or disposition of drugs that are P-gp substrates.  
Data from in vitro studies with transfected MDCK and HEK-293 kidney cells indicate that, while not 
inhibitors of hOAT1 or hOCT2, dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide were inhibitors of 
hOAT3, with IC50 values of 33 and 100 μM, respectively; the metabolite was also a substrate of hOAT3. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity of dapagliflozin has been evaluated in an extensive non-clinical programme. The toxicology 
programme included single-dose and repeat dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs, in vivo and in 
vitro genotoxicity studies, reproduction and developmental toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose oral toxicity studies with dapagliflozin were conducted at doses of 375 to 3000 mg/kg in 
mice and rats and 200 to 1000 mg/kg (2 doses of 500 mg/kg) in dogs. Dapagliflozin was tolerated at 
doses up to 1500 mg/kg in mice, 375 mg/kg in rats, and 1000 mg/kg in dogs. Doses of 3000 mg/kg in 
mice and 750 mg/kg in rats were associated with mortality, while no lethality was observed in the 
single-dose dog study. No dapagliflozin related gross pathologic lesions were noted. Also no cause of 
death were noted in any of the mice or rats that died during the single-dose toxicity studies. Although 
exposures were not measured in these studies, exposure multiples are expected to be very large (> 
1000× in mice and > 3000× in rats) based on comparisons to exposures in repeat dose studies at 
similar doses, and therefore, the lethality observed in mice and rats was not considered relevant to 
humans. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with dapagliflozin have been performed by oral administration for time 
intervals up to 3 months in mice, 6 months in rats, and 12 months in dogs. The pivotal GLP studies 
covered all required outcome measures (toxicokinetic, clinical observations, food and water 
consumption, haematology, ophthalmology, coagulation, serum chemistry, urianalysis, gross and 
histopathological examinations of tissues).

Mice 
CD-1 mice were administered dapagliflozin at oral gavage doses of 4.1, 25, 43, or 75 mg/kg/day (18 
males, 18 females per dose) for 1 week, doses of 0, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (10 males per dose, 5 
males for the highest dose) for 4 consecutive weeks, doses of 0, 50, 150, or 250 mg/kg/day (10 
males, 10 females per dose) for 12 consecutive weeks. The NOAEL was considered to be 75 mg/kg/day 
in this study with an exposure of ≤ 298 μg.h/mL.  
In a 1-month exploratory study, the administration of 150 mg/kg/day of dapagliflozin to male mice 
was associated with the death of one out of 10 mice. No dapagliflozin-related pathologic changes or 
cause of death were determined. There were no dapagliflozin-related deaths in the 300 mg/kg/day 
dose group dosed for 2 weeks in this study suggesting that the death at 150 mg/kg/day was not 
dapagliflozin-related. Clinical signs reported in this study were restricted to rough/urine-stained hair 
coats at 150 mg/kg/day and polyuria at 150 and 300 mg/kg/day.  
In a 3-months mouse toxicity study, 76 mice were administered 50, 150, 250, and 400 mg/kg/day of 
dapagliflozin. The administration of dapagliflozin in the 250 and 400 mg/kg/day dose groups was not 
tolerated and was associated with dapagliflozin related deaths (4 males and 5 females for the 250 
mg/kg/day dose and 7 males and 4 females in the 400 mg/kg/day dose). No cause of death was 
identified. Decreased activity, abdominal distention and hunched posture were observed at all doses in 
the 3-month mouse toxicity study starting on Day 3. The effects generally increased with dose and are 
most likely related to off target inhibition of intestinal SGLT1 and the decreased intestinal absorption of 
glucose. The clinical observations in the 3-month mouse toxicity study were not associated with 
decreases in body weights or food consumption. In fact, dapagliflozin-treated mice actually exhibited 
increased food consumption at all doses (26 to 44%) with an increase in end-of study body-weight 
gains relative to controls. Pathologic changes were limited to decreases in absolute prostate weight (20 
to 23%) at 150 and 250 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was considered to be 150 mg/kg/day in this study 
with an exposure of ≤ 492 μg.h/mL.

Rats 
Sprague Dawley rats were administered dapagliflozin at oral gavage doses of 0, 5, 50, or 300 
mg/kg/day (10 males, 10 females per dose) for 4 consecutive weeks, doses of 0, 5, 50, or 200 
mg/kg/day (15 males, 15 females per dose) for 12 consecutive weeks, doses of 0, 5, 25, or 150 
mg/kg/day (30 males, 30 females per dose) for 26 consecutive weeks. The NOAEL was considered to 
be 50 mg/kg/day in the 4 weeks study with an exposure ≤ 292 μg.h/mL, 50 mg/kg/day in the 12 
weeks study with an exposure ≤ 438 μg.h/mL and 25 mg/kg/day in the 26 weeks study with an 
exposure ≤ 314 μg.h/mL. Dapagliflozin exhibited potent pharmacologic activity with increases in 
urinary glucose excretion at all doses examined. As in the mouse, the resulting loss of calories 
induced compensatory increases in food consumption in the rat. However, in most studies conducted 
in rats, increases in food consumption were associated with decreases in body weight and body 
weight gains. Dapagliflozin induced glucosuria was also associated with increases in urinary volume, 
decreases in urine osmolality, and compensatory increases in water consumption. The increase in 
urinary glucose will lead to an increased risk for urinary infections. A few cases were observed in rats. 
Increases in adrenal gland weights were noted in rats, most likely due to a compensatory increase in 
aldosterone production in response to the increased loss of sodium. The target organs for toxicity 
were kidney and bone. Kidney findings were reactive hyperplasia of collecting duct epithelium, dilation 
of cortical and/or medullary tubules, and mineralisation of the collection ducts and exacerbation of 
chronic progressive neuropathy (CPN). There were changes indicative of abnormal bone formation. 
The mineralisation and bone changes were related to increases in serum calcium. A mechanistic study 
in rats on a glucose-free diet suggested that these findings were related to off-target inhibition of 
intestinal SGLT1 at high doses. No changes in serum calcium, no renal effects and no mineralisation 
were observed in rats on glucose-free diet. Liver enzymes (ALT, AST) were increased with 
dapagliflozin in rats.  
Dogs 
Beagle dogs were administered dapagliflozin at oral gavage doses of 0, 5, 25, or 250 mg/kg/day (3 
males, 3 females per dose) for 4 consecutive weeks, doses of 0, 5, 30, or 180 mg/kg/day (5 males, 5 
females per dose) for 12 consecutive weeks, doses of 0, 5, 20, or 120 mg/kg/dose (11 males, 11 
females per dose) for 52 consecutive weeks. The NOAEL was considered to be 25 mg/kg/day in the 4 
weeks study with an exposure ≤ 394 μg.h/mL, 30 mg/kg/day in the 12 weeks study with an exposure 
≤ 549 μg.h/mL and 120 mg/kg/day in the 52 weeks study with an exposure ≤ 1540 μg•h/mL. Similar 
to the rat, dapagliflozin exhibited potent pharmacologic activity with increases in urinary glucose 
excretion at all doses examined. The loss of calories from urinary glucose excretion induced decreases 
in body weight and body-weight gains in these studies despite compensatory increases in food 
consumption. High doses of dapagliflozin were also associated with increases in emesis and diarrhea in 
dog repeat dose toxicity studies. The increased incidence of diarrhea following dapagliflozin 
administration is most likely due to the off-target inhibition of SGLT1 in the intestines and the resulting 
decreases in intestinal glucose absorption. Administration of high doses of dapagliflozin was associated 
with slight increases in total serum cholesterol (≤ 1.6× relative to controls) in the 1, 3 and 12 months 
dapagliflozin dog studies. Increases in serum cholesterol are most likely due to the observed increased 
food consumption in dogs following dapagliflozin administration. There was no target organ toxicity 
observed in the repeat-dose dog toxicity studies even at very high doses of dapagliflozin (≤ 3312×). 
As in rats, increases in adrenal gland weights and a few cases of urinary infections were noted in dogs.

These in vitro screening results were further substantiated by results from a 12-month dog toxicity 
study, in which exposure to the 3-O-glucuronide metabolite at the no-observed adverse effect-level 
(NOAEL; 120 mg/kg/day) was estimated to be approximately 90× the human exposure to this 
metabolite at the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg. Based on clinical and veterinary 
observations, clinical pathology and histopathology, there was no evidence of any 
estrogenic/androgenic effects or disruption of hormonal balance in dogs through 1 year of exposure. 
Thus, these data also support the conclusion that the 3-Oglucuronide metabolite does not induce 
toxicity or any signs of hormonal imbalance in vivo at relative large multiples of the human metabolite 
exposure. 
Genotoxicity 
In vitro 
The in vitro reverse mutation assays in the S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 
and E.Coli strain WP2uvrA were negative with dapagliflozin in the presence of S9 activation. 
Chromosomal aberration tests in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were negative without metabolic 
activation but consistently positive with metabolic activation. In an in vitro micronucleus screening 
assay in CHO cells, dapagliflozin was clastogenic at concentrations ≥ 100 μg/mL in the presence of S9 
metabolic activation.  
In vivo 
Due to the positive response in in vitro clastogenicity tests with metabolic activation, follow up in vivo 
tests were additionally performed. Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) assays in rat hepatocytes with 
dapagliflozin showed negative results. The micronucleus aberrations assays in the bone marrow of rats 
with dapagliflozin were negative. In the chromosomal aberrations assay in peripheral blood 
lymphocytes of rats, there was a small dose-dependent increase in the percentage of aberrations in 
male rats (from 0.4 to 2.2%). These differences were not statistically significant and the numbers are 
within the historical control range at the laboratory; the Applicant concluded that dapagliflozin was not 
clastogenic in this assay and this is supported by the CHMP.  
Considering the clearly negative in vivo assays covering structural as well as numerical chromosome 
alterations and in addition the absence of induction of DNA repair in vivo the positive effects in in vitro 
tests with metabolic activation are regarded to be biologically irrelevant. In conclusion there is no 
evidence for any clinically relevant genotoxic potential of dapagliflozin. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of dapagliflozin was evaluated in 24-month oral carcinogenicity studies in 
mice and rats. No short-term carcinogenicity studies were performed; the dose selection for the long-
term studies was based on the repeated-dose toxicity studies.

Table 1.  Steady-state exposures and AUC multiples from the carcinogenicity studies in mice 
and rats 
Mice (study DN06072) 
Exposure of CD-1 mice towards dapagliflozin in this study was sufficiently high, and a sufficient 
number of animals survived to allow meaningful conclusions. In high-dose males’ survival was 
markedly reduced compared to controls. The Applicant argued that the males spontaneously developed 
mouse urologic syndrome, a background condition commonly seen in CD-1 mice, leading to urogenital 
obstruction and mortality. Thus, the higher diuresis caused by dapagliflozin would deteriorate the 
sequels of urogenital obstruction and hence lead to higher mortality. This explanation was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. Importantly, the number of neoplasms was not increased in response to 
dapagliflozin treatment so that it is unlikely that the increased mortality was linked to neoplastic 
processes. Hence, the mouse carcinogenesis study gave no hint for carcinogenic potential of 
dapagliflozin. The non-neoplastic findings are in line with the established action of dapagliflozin, 
increased (osmotic) diuresis in response to the desired increase in renal glucose excretion and do not 
raise further concern. In particular, dilation of the renal pelvis and distension of the urinary bladder 
were observed, most likely due to the high urine volumes to be handled.  
Rats (study DN06073) 
Exposure of Sprague Dawley rats towards dapagliflozin was sufficiently high, and a sufficient number 
of animals survived to allow meaningful conclusions. The number of neoplasms was not increased in 
response to dapagliflozin treatment. Hence, the rat carcinogenesis study gave no hint for carcinogenic 
potential of dapagliflozin. The non-neoplastic findings in rats are in line with the observations made in 
the repeated-dose toxicity studies and raise no further concern. 
The carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were performed at large exposure multiples in comparison 
to clinical exposure. It is agreed that no carcinogenic risk was identified in these studies.

Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
In male and female rats, dapagliflozin showed no effects on mating, fertility or early embryonic 
development at doses up to 75 mg/kg, representing AUC values 675x and 998x clinical exposure, 
respectively. 
Embryo-foetal development 
In the embryofoetal toxicity studies in rats, adverse foetal effects were only observed at very high 
exposure multiples in presence of maternal toxicity. The NOAEL for maternal and developmental 
toxicity was 75 mg/kg, representing an AUC value 141x clinical exposure. 
In rabbits, there were no important findings of maternal or embryofetal toxicity at any dose up to 180 
mg/kg, representing an AUC 1191x clinical exposure. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
In the pre and post-natal study in rats there was an increased incidence and/or severity of renal pelvic 
dilation, in absence of maternal toxicity. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 1 mg/kg, 
representing and AUC 19x clinical exposure. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) were dosed and/or further evaluated  
Juvenile rats (21/sex/group) were dosed once daily with dapagliflozin from postnatal day (PND) 21 
until PND 90 at 0, 1, 15 or 75 mg/kg.

Renal pelvic and tubular dilatations were reported at all dose levels; pup exposures at the lowest dose 
tested were ≥ 15 times the maximum recommended human dose. These findings were associated with 
dose-related increases in kidney weight and macroscopic kidney enlargement observed at all doses. 
The renal pelvic and tubular dilatations observed in juvenile animals did not fully reverse within the 
approximate 1-month recovery period. The persistent renal findings might be due to the reduced 
ability of the developing rat kidney to handle dapagliflozin-increased urine volumes. The primary target 
organs at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg/day (mean AUC on PND 83 ≥ 6.97 μg*h/ml) were the kidney and adrenal 
gland. The findings unique to juvenile animals suggest a decreased capacity in juveniles to mount 
compensatory metabolic responses to dapagliflozin’s pharmacology. The findings in the juvenile rat 
toxicity study are in line with the findings in the pre and post-natal toxicity study.

Local Tolerance  
In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted in isolated bovine corneas, rabbits, mice, and dogs to 
determine the ocular irritation, dermal irritation, sensitization potential and vascular/perivascular 
irritation potential of dapagliflozin. These studies were conducted for the purpose of establishing 
occupational worker safety in the event of ocular or dermal exposure to dapagliflozin, and to support 
the intravascular administration of dapagliflozin to humans in an absolute bioavailability study. 
In a Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay, dapagliflozin exhibited moderate to severe ocular 
toxicity. Dapagliflozin was considered to be a non-sensitizer based on the results of a local lymph node 
assay in the mouse. In an acute dermal irritation study in rabbits, dapagliflozin was a non-irritant. Five 
days of repeated IV administration of an intravenous formulation of dapagliflozin did not cause any 
vascular effects. After subcutaneous injections, there was slight focal necrosis of subcutaneous muscle 
at the injection site. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for dapagliflozin was provided in accordance with the CHMP 
guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00. A Phase I environmental risk assessment was performed to 
evaluate potential environmental risks of dapagliflozin. The log Kow was determined according to study 
OECD 107 with a value of 2.34 at ph /7. Based on the log Kow value being below 4.5, dapagliflozin is 
not expected to be a bio-accumulative substance. The refined PECsurfacewater of 9.15 ng/L did not exceed 
the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. However the use of market forecasts for Fpen refinement is not allowed in 
Phase I of the ERA. The applicant performed nevertheless a phase II – Tier A assessment. Based on 
the calculated PEC/PNEC ratios, it is predicted that dapagliflozin will not significantly partition into the 
solid phase waste water treatment in domestic sewage, which means that an ERA in the terrestrial 
compartment is needed. Based on the results of the water/sediment study (OECD study 308), a phase 
II - Tier B assessment was triggered for dapagliflozin.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant has extensively studied the pharmacology of dapagliflozin. These studies demonstrated 
the expected pharmacological response in mice and rats and in in vitro studies a similar activity on 
SGLT2 from mice, rats and humans was observed. The data also suggested a high selectivity versus 
SGLT1, a glucose transporter expressed predominantly in the gut. The selectivity was somewhat less in 
rats and mice, and this may explain some findings in the rat toxicology studies at high doses. The 
activity at SGLT2 from dogs and rabbits was not studied. However the pharmacological activity of 
SGLT2 in dogs was demonstrated in the toxicity studies. Considering the similar activity in mouse, rat 
and human SGLT2 it is considered unlikely that dapagliflozin would not be pharmacologically active in 
the rabbit. It is concluded that toxicity studies have been performed in pharmacologically relevant 
species.  
Studies with a number of receptors, enzymes, ion channels and transporters, including several other 
members of the sodium-glucose co-transporter family, did not identify any risk for off-target effects. 
No specific safety pharmacology studies addressing the CNS or the respiratory system were performed. 
Based on the available data from toxicity studies and the low distribution of dapagliflozin to the brain 
the absence of CNS studies is considered justified. In the absence of respiratory effects in the general 
toxicology studies and with no clinical concerns, the lack of formal respiratory safety pharmacology 
studies is acceptable. 
No studies on pharmacodynamic interactions have been performed. This is considered acceptable. 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin is sufficiently characterised. There are major 
differences in the metabolite pattern in humans and the toxicology species. The main human 
metabolite dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is present at much lower levels in rats and dogs. Studies were 
performed to evaluate the exposure to this metabolite in rats and dogs. Extrapolating from these data 
it was concluded that exposure to the glucuronide was equal to clinical exposure (rat) or higher (dog) 
at NOAEL levels in the toxicology studies. The 3-O-glucoronide is not pharmacologically active and 
glucuronides are generally considered of limited toxicological importance. The Applicant presented data 
from in vitro screening showing no relevant activity of the 3-O-glucuronlide metabolite of dapagliflozin. 
No toxicity was seen in the 12 month dog toxicity study with high exposure multiples. It is agreed that 
the data support the conclusion that the 3-O-glucucuronide metabolite does not induce toxicity or any 
signs of hormonal imbalance in vivo at relatively large multiples of the human metabolite exposure.  
It is therefore agreed that based on metabolism, the toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs are 
appropriate to judge on the toxicological profile of dapagliflozin.  
Since dapagliflozin is a P-gp substrate it cannot be excluded that inhibition of P-gp by a concomitantly 
administered drug could lead to increased exposure in the brain. However, the distribution to the brain 
in rats was shown to be sufficiently high to ascertain that brain exposure in the toxicity studies was 
well above therapeutic plasma exposure.  
Most of the effects in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were considered to be secondary to the 
pharmacologically mediated increase in urinary glucose and included decreases in body weights and/or 
body-weight gains, increases in urine volume and increases in urinary electrolytes. In rats, kidney and 
bone were identified as toxicological target organs. Mechanistic studies suggest that these effects were 
related to off-target effects on SGLT1 in the gut, and it maybe expected that those effects will not 
occur in humans at clinical doses.

While the pharmacological changes in the animals were not considered adverse, it should be borne in 
mind that the toxicology studies are performed in healthy animals. Type 2 diabetes is commonly 
associated with renal defects. The safety in patients with renal impairment needs to be carefully 
addressed clinically. It is not considered that vital information on safety could be gained by performing 
further toxicology studies in animal models of disease. 
The increase in urinary glucose will lead to an increased risk for urinary infections. A few such cases 
were observed in the animal studies but this was only discussed briefly by the Applicant. The risk of 
urinary infections is included in the RMP and in the SmPC. 
Dapagliflozin was shown to induce chromosomal aberrations in eukaryotic cells in presence of 
metabolic activation. However, in vivo studies on genotoxicity were negative and thus dapagliflozin is 
not considered to represent a genotoxic risk to humans.  
The carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats did not indicate any carcinogenic risk. The studies were 
performed with very high exposure multiples.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with dapagliflozin did not indicate a risk for effects on 
fertility, early embryonic development or embryofoetal development. 
In the pre- and postnatal development study in rats, there were findings on renal pelvic dilatation in 
the offspring in absence of maternal toxicity. Similar findings were seen in a juvenile toxicity study in 
rats. The Applicant argued that these effects are due to a reduced ability of the developing rat kidney 
to handle dapagliflozin-increased urine volumes. Although there was a reasonable exposure margin at 
the developmental NOAEL in the pre- and postnatal study (19x clinical exposure), these effects are 
reflected in the SmPC. 
An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for dapagliflozin was provided in accordance with the CHMP 
guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 including a phase I, phase II- Tier A and phase II-Tier B 
assessment. Based on these data, the CHMP considers that dapagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The overall non-clinical development programme was considered adequate to support the marketing 
authorisation application for dapagliflozin and the concerns identified by the CHMP during its evaluation 
are considered resolved.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant is seeking a Marketing Authorisation for dapagliflozin film-coated tablets (5 and 10 mg) 
for the once-daily treatment of T2DM in adults, either as monotherapy in patients intolerant to 
metformin or as add-on combination therapy with other glucose lowering drugs including insulin, when 
these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. The recommended 
starting dose is 10 mg taken once daily. In patients with severe hepatic impairment a starting dose of 
5 mg is recommended. If well tolerated, the dose may be increased to 10 mg.  
This application is supported by an extensive clinical program to establish the therapeutic dose and to 
assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin Three phase IIB and eleven phase III studies 
investigating dapagliflozin doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg in the treatment of T2DM in adult patients 
as monotherapy, as add-on combination (to metformin, SU, TZD and insulin), and as initial 
combination therapy with metformin. 
Scientific advice was provided by the CHMP in February 2008 (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/485029/2007) on 
the clinical aspects of the development program with main focus on the Phase 3 program. The 
importance of investigating the lower dose range in the Phase 3 studies was pointed out. Potential 
safety issues were also discussed such as the risk of electrolyte imbalances. The need to include 
sufficient numbers of patients from the EU was stressed as well as the need to include elderly patients. 
The design of study DC1690C00006 to support the add-on indication to insulin was discussed and 
points were made on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The proposed investigation of changes in 
body weight/body composition was also discussed and the Applicant’s strategy was endorsed. Further, 
risk mitigation actions proposed by the Applicant were discussed and the proposals were generally 
found acceptable. The advice given has been followed in all essential parts. 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant 
has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. The table below lists only 
the main phase II dose-finding and the main phase III studies submitted as part of this Marketing 
Authorisation Application.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology programme for dapagliflozin included 28 studies conducted in 688 subjects 
(635 of these subjects were exposed to dapagliflozin) (Table 5). These studies included healthy 
subjects as well as subjects with T2DM (118 subjects, 101 exposed to dapagliflozin) and subjects with 
renal or hepatic impairment (20 and 18 subjects respectively, all exposed to dapagliflozin).  
Aqueous solutions of dapagliflozin were used for oral doses <10 mg in the single ascending dose study, 
for oral doses <1 mg in the low dose study, for the ADME study and for the microtracer dose 
administered intravenously in the absolute oral bioavailability study. Capsule formulations were used in 
the Phase 1 ascending dose studies and the Phase 2a study. Tablet formulations were used in the 
Phase 2b studies. Film-coated tablet formulations were subsequently developed for the Phase 3 
program (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg dose strengths). A common granulation was used for the 5 and 10 mg 
strengths of the Phase 3 tablets, and the tablets proposed for commercialisation. Clinical Pharmacology 
studies generally used the Phase 3 tablet formulation.  
Plasma dapagliflozin concentrations were measured using validated liquid chromatography tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) bioanalytical methods. Pharmacokinetic parameters in clinical 
pharmacology studies were generally calculated by non-compartmental methods. Nonlinear mixed 
effects modelling (population pharmacokinetic analysis) was used to evaluate pharmacokinetics in 
phase III patients.

Absorption  
Dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in the fasted state, with Cmax usually 
observed about 1h after administration. The Caco-2 cell data suggest that dapagliflozin is a weak P-gp 
substrate. As absolute bioavailability is high, potential interaction with P-gp inhibitors is not expected 
to result in clinically relevant interactions in vivo. Absolute bioavailability (78%) and mass balance data 
(about 75% of dose excreted in urine as parent compound and in urine and faeces as phase I and II 
metabolites) suggest that dapagliflozin is a BCS Class III compound.  
Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability was determined in study MB102059 in 7 healthy fasted subjects (Caucasian 
males with a mean age of 26 years). Subjects received a 10 mg oral dose of dapagliflozin first followed 
an hour later, at approximately the time of the oral dapagliflozin tmax, by an 80 µg micro-tracer dose 
of [14C]dapagliflozin infused intravenously over 1 minute. PK samples were collected at selected time 
points up to 49 h post oral dose. Plasma concentrations of dapagliflozin were determined by 
LC-MS/MS, while the plasma concentrations of [14C]dapagliflozin were determined using an accelerator 
mass spectrometry (AMS) method, thereby allowing the individual quantification of the simultaneously 
administered oral and intravenous doses. The geometric mean absolute bioavailability was 77.8% (CV 
9%), with individual values ranging from 70 to 90%. 
Bioequivalence 
The differences between the Phase 3 and the proposed commercial formulations are minor (colour, 
shape, debossing and grade of microcrystalline cellulose) and their in vitro dissolution characteristics 
possess a high degree of similarity. As such, comparable in vivo performance of the commercial tablet 
formulations compared to the Phase 3 tablet formulations is anticipated. Since the 5 and 10 mg 
formulations share the same granulation, the biopharmaceutics program has studied the 10 mg 
formulations, where appropriate, and these data are considered applicable to the 5 mg formulations. 
Comparison between capsule and tablet 
Study MB102005 was conducted to bridge the early clinical capsule formulation of dapagliflozin with 
the Phase 2b clinical tablets. Fourteen subjects received dapagliflozin as either 5 x 10 mg capsule or 
1 x 50 mg clinical tablet. Bioequivalence was demonstrated for AUCinf, AUC0-t (90% confidence interval 
1.00-1.08) and Cmax (90% confidence interval 0.82-1.09). 
Influence of heat-stress on the tablet formulation 
The drug substance converts to an amorphous desolvate upon exposure to high temperature for 
extended period (heat-stress). To assess the in vivo impact of the potential physical form change in 
tablets after heat stress (crystalline to amorphous), two bioequivalence studies using the proposed 
commercial tablets (heat-stressed and non heat-stressed) were conducted with the 2.5 mg (study 
MB102090) and 10 mg (study MB102062) tablet strengths. Bioequivalence was demonstrated for both 
AUC and Cmax when comparing heat-stressed versus non-heat stressed conditions. For the 10 mg 
tablet the point estimates (90%CI) were 0.99 (0.969, 1.021) for AUC and 1.01 (0.925, 1.122) for 
Cmax. Similar results were observed for the 2.5 mg tablet.

Influence of food 
Study MB102019 was conducted to evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on the single-dose 
pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin. Fourteen subjects received a single, oral 10 mg dose of dapagliflozin 
(Phase 3 tablet formulation) administered while fasting or after a high-fat meal. The meal contained 
985 kcal with 52% of calories from fat, 34% from carbohydrates and 14% from proteins. The mean 
dapagliflozin plasma concentration time profile is displayed in the figure below. 
Figure 1.  Mean (+SD) Plasma Concentration-Time Profiles of Dapagliflozin after  
administration of 10 mg in fasting and fed state  
Administration of dapagliflozin with a high-fat meal reduced the rate but not the extent of absorption 
resulting in a 1 h delay of tmax and a 30-45% decrease in Cmax but no change in AUC. In the Phase 3 
program dapagliflozin was administered before breakfast or dinner. The cumulative urinary excretion 
data, with similar glucose excretion over the first 8 h for the 2.5 and 10 mg doses, suggest that 
glucose excretion seems to become saturated at higher concentrations and that a 30-50% reduction in 
Cmax is not clinically relevant. Hence, dapagliflozin may be taken with or without food.  
Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of dapagliflozin was determined by equilibrium dialysis at 
dapagliflozin concentrations 500 and 5000 ng/ml. The in vitro plasma protein binding was 91%. The ex 
vivo plasma protein binding of dapagliflozin in healthy human subjects was ~92%, and was similar to 
that in diabetic subjects with or without renal impairment and in subjects with hepatic impairment. The 
in vitro protein binding of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide in human plasma was similar to parent 
dapagliflozin at 89% bound. In the massbalance study the ratio between blood and plasma in AUC of 
radioactivity was 0.58, suggesting no distribution to blood cells. The mean Vss for dapagliflozin 
following intravenous administration was 118L (study MB102059). Vss was greater than plasma 
volume, indicative of extravascular distribution.

Study 930045130 was conducted to determine if dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is a substrate of renal 
uptake transporters and whether dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide have the potential to 
inhibit renal uptake transporters. The substrate studies on dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide were 
performed using stably transfected HEK-293 or MDCK cells that singly expressed each of the following 
transporters, hOCT2, hOAT1, and hOAT3. The studies indicate that dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is a 
substrate of hOAT3, but not hOCT2 and hOAT1 in vitro. The Km value of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide 
for transport by hOAT3 was 115 μM. 
To conclude, dapagliflozin is relatively highly bound to proteins, with a fraction bound of 92%. Volume 
of distribution is 118 L, suggesting extravascular distribution. The main (inactive) metabolite 
dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide was found to be a substrate of hOAT3.  
Elimination 
Dapagliflozin is mainly eliminated by metabolism. The geometric mean clearance of dapagliflozin 
following i.v. administration was 207 mL/min. The clearance is substantially less than the plasma flow 
to either liver or kidney, indicating low hepatic and renal extraction. The terminal half-life after 
intravenous administration was 12.2 h. 
Excretion 
In study MB102006, [14C]dapagliflozin 50 mg oral solution was administered as a single dose to 
6 healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. About 96% of the radioactive dose administered was 
recovered in the excreta within 13 days following administration, with 75% of the dose recovered in 
urine and 21% in faeces. 76% of the total recovery was within 24 h after dosing and 89% of the total 
recovery was within 48 h after dosing. Only 1.6% of the dose was recovered in urine as parent drug. 
Metabolism 
The in vitro metabolism was evaluated in human liver microsomes (HLM) and recombinant human 
enzymes expressing CYP450 (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and 
CYP3A5) and UGT (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, 
UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, and UGT2B17) enzymes.  
Based on inhibition and correlation studies UGT1A9 was identified as the main enzyme metabolising 
dapagliflozin. The formation rate for dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (m15), the predominant human in 
vivo metabolite, by human recombinant UGT1A9 was ~100-times greater than that observed with any 
other UGT tested, and the formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide correlated with UGT1A9 activity 
in a panel of human liver microsomes (study DCN 930034845). Niflumic acid (potent UGT1A9 
inhibitor), mefenamic acid (UGT1A9 and 2B7 inhibitor), propofol (UGT1A9 substrate) inhibited m15 
formation in both recombinant UGT1A9 and pooled HLM. In experiments with a bank of microsomes 
isolated from 15 individual donors, significant correlation was observed between m15 formation and 
glucuronidation of the UGT1A9 substrate propofol. No significant correlation was found between m15 
formation and formation of conjugates of known UGT1A1 substrates, such as estradiol, EE and 
bilirubin, which further confirms that the formation of m15 is not catalyzed by UGT1A1. UGT2B7 and 
UGT2B4 exhibited catalytic activity with respect to the formation of a second minor glucuronide, 
dapagliflozin 2-O-glucuronide (m10).

The rate of dapagliflozin metabolism was investigated in human liver, kidney, and intestine 
microsomes supplemented with UDPGA. The formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide was more rapid 
in microsomes from kidney than in microsomes from either liver or intestine (formation rates of 184, 
60.8, and 1.69 pmol/minute/mg protein, respectively). In human kidney microsomes, the intrinsic 
clearance (Vmax/Km) resulting from formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (1.66 µL/minute/mg 
protein) was much more rapid than that resulting from formation of dapagliflozin 2-O-glucuronide 
(0.0173 µL/minute/mg). The formation of dapagliflozin 2-O-glucuronide was more rapid in liver 
microsomes than in either kidney or intestine microsomes (formation rates of 2.80, 1.34, and 0.81 
pmol/minute/mg protein, respectively). These tissue differences are consistent with the higher 
expression of UGT1A9 (the enzyme principally responsible for the formation of dapagliflozin 
3-O-glucuronide) in human kidney relative to human liver, and the higher expression of UGT2B7 (the 
enzyme principally responsible for the formation of dapagliflozin 2-O-glucuronide) in human liver 
relative to human kidney.  
The metabolism of dapagliflozin was investigated in 6 healthy male human subjects following a single 
oral dose of [14C]dapagliflozin 50 mg in solution (study MB102006). Plasma prepared from blood 
collected at 1, 4, and 12 hours after dosing and urine and faeces collected from 0 to 312 hours after 
dosing were analyzed for metabolites.  
Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide was the predominant drug-related component in human plasma, 
accounting for 42% [based on AUC(0-12 h)] of total plasma radioactivity, similar to the 39% 
contribution by parent drug. No other metabolite detected in human plasma constituted >5% of 
plasma radioactivity. 
Dapagliflozin was extensively metabolized in humans with 73.7% of the dose being recovered as 
metabolites (72.0 and 1.65% in urine and faeces, respectively) and 16.6% of the dose being recovered 
as unchanged parent compound (1.2 and 15.4% in urine and faeces, respectively). The metabolic 
routes included glucuronidation (m15, m10, m13), dealkylation (m8), and oxidation at various 
positions of the molecule (m12). Combinations of these reactions produced desethyl dapagliflozin 
glucuronides. Approximately 9% of the dose underwent oxidative metabolism (~ 29% of the oxidative 
metabolites were also glucuronidated) and ~ 66% of the dose underwent direct glucuronidation. 
Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (m15) constituted 60.7% of the dose (all recovered in urine); the only 
other metabolite representing > 5% of the dose was dapagliflozin 2-O-glucuronide (5.4%) (m10).  
Hence, based on in vitro and in vivo data, glucuronidation is the main elimination pathway with 
dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide being the main human metabolite and UGT1A9 the main metabolising 
enzyme. 
UGT1A9 is preferentially expressed in human kidney, and in vitro data indicate that dapagliflozin 3-O-
glucuronide is formed in both kidney and liver. Hence, formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide in the 
kidney may play an important role in the disposition of dapagliflozin. While the precise relative 
contribution of renal versus hepatic glucuronidation of dapagliflozin in humans is not known, the 
impact of severe hepatic impairment and severe renal impairment (67 and 87% higher AUC 
parameters compared to the reference populations, respectively) on the exposure of dapagliflozin are 
similar which is indicative of both the liver and the kidney being substantially involved in the metabolic 
clearance of dapagliflozin.

PK of metabolites 
The main metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, has a slightly higher exposure than dapagliflozin 
(1.3-fold higher exposure on a molar basis) in healthy volunteers and about 2-fold higher exposure in 
subjects with T2DM. The in vitro effect is very low compared to dapagliflozin, and the metabolite will 
thus not contribute to efficacy. Other metabolites accounted for less than 12% of parent plasma 
exposure. The pharmacologically active metabolite BMS-511926 has very low plasma exposure, AUC 
<1% of dapagliflozin AUC and will thus not contribute to the in vivo activity of the drug. 
Possible genetic polymorphism 
In order to study the effects of UGT1A9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on dapagliflozin 
clearance, a sub-study was conducted to explore the association between dapagliflozin clearance and 
SNP genotypes from the UGT1A9 gene. The Applicant concludes that the UGT1A9 genotyping results 
and the distribution of dapagliflozin clearance values suggest that UGT1A9 polymorphism does not 
impact the PK of dapagliflozin to any meaningful extent. The genotypes evaluated had only a small 
influence on dapagliflozin clearance, with differences up to 31%. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality has been evaluated over the dose range 0.1 to 500 mg after single dose 
administration and 2.5 to 100 mg multiple dose administration in healthy volunteers and type 2 
diabetes patients. To assess the proportionality of dapagliflozin fasted doses, linear regression of 
log[Cmax] on log(dose) and of log(AUC) on log(dose) were performed for dapagliflozin, using a power 
model. The slope for Cmax was estimated to be 0.975 and for AUC 1.017 supporting dose proportional 
increase in exposure over the dose range 0.1-500 mg. It can be concluded that dapagliflozin displays 
linear pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar on Day 7 and 14. Time of day of 
dosing (in the morning (AM) or in the evening (PM)) was tested as a covariate on CL/F in the 
population PK model development but was found not to be significant. There are no indications of time 
dependency in dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics. 
Special populations 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
MB102003 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group, multiple-dose study 
designed to provide an initial assessment of the safety, tolerability, PD, and PK of dapagliflozin in 47 
diabetic subjects following once-daily administration of 5, 25, and 100-mg dapagliflozin for 14 days. 
Subjects taking stable doses of metformin for at least 4 weeks were maintained at that dose 
throughout the study. Cmax and AUC increased approximately in proportion to dose in the dose range 
5 to 25 mg but slightly more than dose proportional at 100 mg. 
Comparison of the exposure in study MB1002003 in T2DM patients and MB1002002 in healthy 
volunteers suggest similar dapagliflozin exposure in T2DM patients and healthy volunteers. This is also 
supported by the population PK analysis, where subject type was not statistically significant in the final 
model whereas other factors (renal function, body weight and gender) explained the inter-individual 
variability. The exposure to the main metabolite was about 40% higher in type 2 diabetes patients 
than in healthy volunteers.

Renal impairment 
The effects of renal impairment on the PD and/or PK of dapagliflozin have been evaluated in a Clinical 
Pharmacology renal impairment study, in a pooled analysis of Clinical Pharmacology studies (normal 
renal function and mild renal impairment), and in a PPK analysis (patients with T2DM with normal renal 
function and mild or moderate renal impairment).  
The effect of renal impairment on dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics was evaluated in T2DM patients after 
single (50 mg) and multiple (20 mg for 7 days) dose administration. Patients with normal renal 
function (GFR > 80 ml/min, n=12) or mild (GFR 50 – 80 ml/min n=8), moderate (GFR 30-50 ml/min, 
n=8) or severe (GFR <30 ml/min, n=4) renal impairment were included in the study. A group of 
healthy subjects with normal renal function (GFR > 80 ml/min, n=8) was included in the single dose 
part of the study. Iohexol clearance was used to determine GFR. In addition measured urinary 
creatinine clearance was assessed using urinary creatinine excretion (Ucr) over 24 hours and serum 
creatinine (Scr) measured at the 12 hour timepoint. Also creatinine clearance was estimated using the 
Cockroft Gault formula.  
Table 6.  Summary Statistics for Dapagliflozin Pharmacokinetic Parameters (20 mg 
Dapagliflozin Once-Daily) 
Dapagliflozin exposure is increased in patients with reduced renal impairment. Based on linear 
regressions of logarithmically transformed AUCtau and iohexol clearance (GFR) an about 1.3, 1.5 and 
1.8-fold increase in exposure was estimated in mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, 
respectively. Metabolite exposure was increased about 2- and 3-fold in moderate and severe renal 
impairment respectively. These data support the claim that dapagliflozin metabolism via UGT1A9 to a 
large extent takes place in the kidney.

Compared to subjects with T2DM and normal renal function, renal glucose clearance was decreased in 
subjects with impaired renal function. On Day 10 renal glucose clearance was decreased by 43 %, 84% 
and 84%, respectively in subjects with T2DM and mild, moderate and severe renal impairment. The 
urinary glucose excretion over 24 h was similarly reduced. Daily 24 hour urinary glucose excretion was 
85 g of glucose/day from subjects with T2DM and normal renal function and was 51, 18 and 11 g of 
glucose/day from subjects with T2DM and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively. 
Higher systemic exposures to dapagliflozin in subjects with T2DM and moderate or severe renal 
impairment did thus not result in a correspondingly higher renal glucose clearance or total cumulative 
glucose excretion in urine.  
The efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal function. Forxiga is not recommended for use in 
patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (patients with creatinine clearance 
[CrCl] < 60 ml/min or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. No dosage 
adjustment is indicated in patients with mild renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
The influence of hepatic impairment on dapagliflozin’s PK was evaluated in a study including subjects 
with a wide range of hepatic impairment and a fair number of subjects with severe hepatic impairment 
with Child Pugh score 10 and 11. In patients with mild hepatic impairment dapagliflozin’s PK was 
similar to the control group. Moderate hepatic impairment had only a small effect on dapagliflozin’s 
pharmacokinetics, 36% increase in AUC. In patients with severe hepatic impairment with Child Pugh 
score 10-11, the mean increase in dapagliflozin exposure was 67%. Patients at the higher end of Child 
Pugh class C (score 12-15) were not included in the study and it cannot be excluded that they may 
have a larger increase in dapagliflozin exposure. No dose adjustment in patients with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment is necessary. However in patients with severe hepatic impairment, a lower starting 
dose of 5 mg is recommended. If well tolerated, the dose may be increased to 10 mg.  
Gender and race  
The estimates of difference in exposure between male and female patients were consistent between 
the pooled analysis of Clinical Pharmacology studies and the population PK analysis. AUC is about 22% 
higher in females than in males. The difference in AUC between White, Blacks and Asians were <11%. 
No dose adjustment is therefore necessary. 
Weight  
In the pooled analysis of clinical pharmacology studies weight had an influence on dapagliflozin 
exposure resulting in lower exposure in heavy patients and higher exposure in low-weight patients. 
Based on this analysis, a subject weighing 140 kg is expected to have 25% lower AUC than a subject 
weighing 90 kg (mean weight in phase 3 population) and a subject weighing 50 kg 20% higher AUC 
and 40% higher Cmax. The differences in exposure over the weight range 50-140 kg are not large 
enough to warrant a dose adjustment.  
Elderly population 
There is no clinically meaningful increase in exposure based on age alone in subjects up to 
70 years old. However, an increased exposure due to age-related decrease in renal function can be 
expected. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding exposure in patients 
> 70 years old.  
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population have not been studied.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Studies to evaluate the potential of dapagliflozin and the main metabolite to inhibit P-gp and the renal 
uptake transporters hOCT2, hOAT1 and hOAT3 and the potential for dapagliflozin to inhibit CYP1A2, 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 and induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 were conducted in vitro.  
There were no sign for competitive inhibition of CYP isoenzymes or P-gp or mechanism-based inhibitor 
of CYP450 isoenzymes or induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 and only weak inhibition of hOAT3 
(IC50 33 μM). This is however not likely to be clinically relevant at therapeutic concentrations (Cmax of 
dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide at 10-mg dapagliflozin daily 0.49 and 0.56 µM, 
respectively). The potential for dapagliflozin to affect the metabolism of other UGT1A9 substrates has 
not been specifically investigated. The applicant claimed that an interaction is unlikely given the low 
affinity of dapagliflozin to UGT1A9. Additional in vitro studies were submitted with the responses to the 
D120 LOQ. These showed that dapagliflozin is not a substrate for OCT2, OAT1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
and had a Km value for transport via OAT3 of >100 μM. Hence clinically relevant drug interactions via 
inhibition of these transporters are not expected.  
In vivo 
In vivo interaction studies were conducted with metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepriride, 
voglibose, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, simvastatin, digoxin, warfarin and rifampicin. 
No clinically relevant interactions were observed. Rifampicin decreased dapagliflozin AUC by 22%. 
Dapagliflozin increased AUC of simvastatin by 19% and simvastatin acid by 31%.  
Based on the dapagliflozin PK characteristics, there is a potential for clinically relevant interactions with 
inhibitors and inducers of UGT1A9. Potent in vivo inhibitors of UGT1A9 seem to be rare. The Applicant 
submitted during the evaluation an in vivo interaction study with an inhibitor of UGT1A9. Co-
administration of the UGT1A9 inhibitor mefenamic acid under steady state conditions with a single 
dose of dapagliflozin resulted in a 55% increase in dapagliflozin AUCt, 22% reduction in dapagliflozin 
3-O-glucuronide AUC and an increase in urine excretion of glucose. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin was evaluated in 8 phase-I studies. Potential PD interactions 
were evaluated in 4 additional studies. A further study aimed at investigating dapagliflozin’s effect on 
QT interval.

Mechanism of action 
Dapagliflozin is a selective and orally-active inhibitor of the human renal sodium glucose co-transporter 
type 2 (SGLT2), the major transporter responsible for renal glucose re-absorption. Dapagliflozin lowers 
plasma glucose by inhibiting the renal re-absorption of glucose in the proximal tubule, thereby 
promoting its urinary excretion. Dapagliflozin’s mechanism of action is dependent on glomerular 
filtration rate. The absence of complete inhibition of renal glucose re-absorption may be the result of 
the action of uninhibited SGLT2 or other tubular transport mechanisms such as SGLT1. When SGLT2 is 
inhibited by dapagliflozin, the amount of glucose excreted in the urine is dependent on the filtered 
glucose load, which is the product of glomerular filtration rate and serum glucose concentration. As a 
consequence, even if glomerular filtration rates are comparable, higher amounts of glucose are 
excreted in the urine by subjects with T2DM compared to healthy subjects. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
In healthy subjects and in subjects with T2DM, an increase in the amount of glucose excreted in the 
urine was observed following the administration of dapagliflozin doses ≥ 0.3 mg. 
The change from baseline in the amount of glucose excreted over 24 hours post dapagliflozin dosing 
was higher for a given dapagliflozin dose in subjects with T2DM compared to healthy subjects. This 
finding was expected since subjects with T2DM with normal renal function have a higher amount of 
glucose filtered by the kidney due to their higher systemic glucose concentrations. Dapagliflozin 
exhibited similar PD properties in Japanese and US- based subjects. 
In subjects with T2DM, dapagliflozin treatment at 10 mg/day for 12 weeks was associated with a mean 
urinary glucose excretion of 68 g/day and maximal increase in excretion was observed at doses ≥ 20 
mg/day (85 g of glucose/day). Doses of dapagliflozin higher than 20 mg resulted in an increase in the 
duration of glucose excretion into the urine without further increase in the 24 hour post-dose period. 
At a dose of 10 mg dapagliflozin QD, the rate of urinary glucose excretion at steady-state was constant 
over 24 h indicating that the proposed dose of 10 mg is equally effective over the entire dosing interval 
and that once daily dosing of 10 mg dapagliflozin is appropriate. The 10 mg dose is also supported by 
population-based integrated modelling and simulation analysis. The modelling approach is considered 
adequate and allows successful assessment of efficacy, estimated as effect on FPG and HbA1c for 
different doses. The selected dose was found to maximize the efficacy of dapagliflozin and is supported 
by the modelling outcomes. 
The steady-state 24 h urinary glucose excretion was highly dependent on renal function (e.g. 85, 51, 
18 and 11 g of glucose/day were excreted in T2DM subjects with normal, mildly, moderately or 
severely impaired renal function, respectively).  
Findings from the PD studies suggest that SGLT2 activity is not up regulated in response to 
dapagliflozin treatment in subjects with T2DM over the course of 2 weeks and indicate that an increase 
in glucose excretion leads to reduced filtered glucose loads in hyperglycaemic subjects following 
improved short-term glycaemic control, which in turn may result in lower amounts of glycosuria over 
time.

By promoting urinary glucose excretion, dapagliflozin results in osmotic diuresis and an increase in 
urinary volume. In subjects with T2DM, urinary volume increases were sustained at 12 weeks 
(approximately 375 mL/day). The increase in urinary volume was associated with a small and transient 
(2-3 days) increase in urinary sodium excretion that was not associated with changes in serum sodium 
concentrations. In addition, following administration of 10 mg dapagliflozin/day for 7 days to healthy 
subjects, urinary uric acid excretion was increased transiently (3-7 days) accompanied by a slight 
reduction in mean serum uric acid concentration (up to a 2 mg/dL, reduction after 7 days). No 
apparent increase in urinary calcium excretion after SD or MD of dapagliflozin was observed but day-to 
day variability of daily Ca excretion was high. No relevant effects of dapagliflozin on serum chemistries 
(sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, bicarbonate, creatinine, BUN) and 
osmolality was observed in healthy volunteers. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Exposure response 
The exposure response was evaluated before phase III using data from phase I and II studies in 
healthy volunteers and T2DM patients covering a wide range of doses evaluating the relationship 
between different exposure measures (dose, AUC, Cmax) and PD (change from baseline in 24 hr 
urinary glucose amount excreted and renal glucose clearance). Moreover, a population-based exposure 
response analysis was conducted using data from the two phase III monotherapy studies, where the 
relationship between the estimated steady state AUCss (obtained using the final PPK model by 
calculating from the individual maximum a posterior (MAP) Bayesian estimates) after dapagliflozin or 
placebo administration and FPG or HbA1c response up to Week 24 was evaluated.  
The relationship between exposure and change from baseline in 24-hr urinary glucose amount 
excreted was described by an Emax model where Emax was estimated to be 83 (95% CI 72-89) g in 
T2DM patients. ED50 was estimated to be 3.97 (95% CI 2.3-5.6) g in the model using dose and 198 
(95%CI 102-294) ng*h/ml in the model using AUC as exposure measure. Based on this model, the 10 
mg dose is expected to result in about 75% of the maximum effect of dapagliflozin on 24 h urinary 
glucose excretion.

The population exposure response model for FPG over time comprised in an additive manner a placebo 
model and a drug effect model. The placebo effect was approximated by a model that assumed a linear 
decrease of FPG from baseline as a function of baseline FPG and time within the 24 week treatment 
period. An indirect response model in which dapagliflozin AUCss was assumed to increase the 
elimination rate of FPG from the plasma pool via an Emax model described the FPG concentration-time 
profile over the 24 week treatment period. The maximal effect (Emax) and the dapagliflozin AUC 
achieving half maximal response (EC50) were estimated. An indirect response model described the 
effect of FPG on HbA1c over time. The model assumes that changes in baseline HbA1c response from 
the placebo effect or dapagliflozin exposure are due to changes in FPG response, given individual 
baseline HbA1c. The formation and elimination rates of HbA1c were estimated. For a typical subject 
with baseline FPG of 160 mg/dL and baseline HbA1c of 8.2% receiving dapagliflozin 10 mg QD, the 
model predicts about 25.0 mg/dL [5th, 95th percentiles: 11.4 mg/dL, 69.0 mg/dL] decrease of FPG 
and 1.26% [5th, 95th percentiles: 1.06%, 1.41%] decrease of HbA1c from baseline at the end of 24 
week treatment period with 10 mg QD dapagliflozin. For the effect on FPG, the estimated EC50 in 
AUCss in a typical population is 147 ng.hr/mL [95% CI: 72.1 ng.hr/mL, 222 ng.hr/mL], corresponding 
to the AUCss level of a 3.37 mg [95% CI: 1.65 mg, 5.08 mg] dose QD. Dose levels of 1-, 2.5-, 5- and 
10-mg QD were predicted to give dapagliflozin exposure equivalent to EC24.6, EC43.4, EC60.0, and 
EC74.7, assuming an Emax model at steady state and no placebo effect. Hence, the results from this 
analysis are consistent with the previous analysis of the relationship between exposure and 24 h 
urinary glucose excretion. The model predicts that efficacy at the 10 mg qd dose is about 75% of the 
theoretical maximum effect of dapagliflozin on FPG, which from an efficacy point supports the selected 
dose.  
The relationship between dapagliflozin exposure and an increase in haematocrit (HCT) was described 
by an empirical indirect response model in which dapagliflozin exposure was assumed to increase the 
formation rate of HCT in the blood pool via an Emax model. The increase over baseline in haematocrit 
at the 10 mg QD dose level was predicted to be 2.44% [5th and 95th percentiles: 0.432%, 3.38%]. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
In healthy subjects 7 days of dapagliflozin administration increased 24-h urinary sodium by about 
35%. Bumetanide alone had a larger effect (increasing by 108%). The combination of dapagliflozin and 
bumetanide had a transient (about 3 days) additive effect (maximum increase by 122%). However, 
renal sodium loss may be even higher in patients with T2DM than in healthy volunteers due to the 
expected more pronounced dapagliflozin-induced diuresis. The combined administration of dapagliflozin 
and a loop diuretic such as bumetanide may present a certain risk for clinically-meaningful electrolyte 
disturbances. In addition, the combination of dapagliflozin and bumetanide led to more pronounced 
(increase by 1.164 l on the first day) and prolonged (9 days) renal fluid loss than either drug alone. 
This increase is considered substantial and the effect is maybe even more pronounced in patients with 
T2DM due to higher glucose load and consequently more pronounced osmotic diuresis. Particularly 
elderly patients with an already physiologically decreased sense of thirst may be at increased risk for 
dehydration. Bumetanide transiently (10 days) decreased dapagliflozin-induced urinary glucose 
excretion which is not considered clinically relevant. The results also suggested that dapagliflozin may 
have modest effects upon systolic BP (up to 12 mm Hg reduction) alone or in combination with 
bumetanide in normotensive subjects.

There was a greater than additive increase in 24-h urinary Na+ excretion when single doses of 
dapagliflozin and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were co-administered, compared to either treatment 
administered alone. This may trigger/cause dehydration by leading to increased sodium loss and 
hyponatraemia with sequelae such as insufficient water intake, increase in haematocrit and potentially 
increased risk of thrombosis, particularly in elderly patients with an already decreased sense of thirst. 
Hypotension / hypovolaemia / dehydration were numerically higher in subjects that received a diuretic 
(either loop or thiazide) in combination with an ACE-inhibitor or ARB and received dapagliflozin 
compared with those that received placebo. A respective special warning has been introduced in the 
product information (i.e. section 4.4 of the SmPC), as well as a respective information in sections 
“Interactions” (i.e. section 4.5 of the SmPC) and “Undesirable effects” (i.e. section 4.8. of the SmPC).  
The mean amount of glucose excreted in the urine over 24 h following administration of dapagliflozin 
alone was not markedly affected (-10 to 16%) by rifampicin co-administration and, based on this PD 
endpoint and modest PK effects of rifampicin on dapagliflozin (decrease of 22% in exposure), no dose 
adjustment of dapagliflozin is proposed when it is co-administered with potent CYP inducers.  
The PD effect of warfarin (the prothrombin time-International Nomalized) was not affected by co-
administration of dapagliflozin. 
Thorough QT/TQc study 
The effect of dapagliflozin (SD of 20 mg and 150 mg) on the QTcX interval of healthy subjects was 
investigated in a study primarily aiming at the population corrected QTc-interval [QTcX]. Moxifloxacin 
(SD of 400 mg=) and placebo were the controls. The results of this adequately conducted study 
indicate that dapagliflozin, and in particularly the proposed dose for marketing (i.e. 10 mg qd), has no 
clinically relevant influence on human cardiac repolarisation. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A comprehensive clinical pharmacology programme was submitted to characterise the PK and PD 
profile of dapagliflozin.  
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin have been well documented. The absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and elimination of dapagliflozin have been adequately characterised. The 
effects of intrinsic factors on dapagliflozin PK have been sufficiently characterised.

The Applicant considered that only a ≥ 50% lower mean dapagliflozin systemic exposure and a 
> 100% higher (i.e., 2-fold) dapagliflozin exposure is potentially clinically meaningful, and that 
differences in exposure in different sub-populations within this range should not warrant a dose 
adjustment. The proposed 2-fold limit was further justified by the Applicant during the evaluation. The 
exposure response modelling suggests that a 50% reduction in exposure would result in a decrease in 
efficacy relative to maximum efficacy from 75% at the 10 mg dose level to 60% at the 5 mg dose 
level.  Hence, gender, race, weight, age up to 70 years, mild renal impairment and mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment as well as the potential for UGT1A9 polymorphism seem not to have a clinically 
relevant influence on dapagliflozin’s exposure. In patients with severe hepatic impairment with Child 
Pugh score 10-11, the mean increase in dapagliflozin exposure was 67%. Patients at the higher end of 
Child Pugh class C (score 12-15) were not included and it cannot be excluded that they may have a 
larger increase in dapagliflozin exposure. Given the remaining uncertainty that some patients may 
have even higher exposure increase than the 67% observed on average in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
A number of in vivo interaction studies have been conducted (with metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, 
glimepriride, voglibose, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, simvastatin, digoxin, warfarin and 
rifampicin). The interaction programme was based mainly on drugs likely to be co-administered in the 
target patient population and not on a mechanistic basis with regard to dapagliflozin’s PK 
characteristics and in vitro inhibition potential. From a mechanistic perspective, in vitro studies did not 
reveal any potential for clinically relevant interaction in vivo with CYP450 isoenzymes, or the transport 
proteins OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  
Based on dapagliflozin’s PK characteristics, there is a potential for clinically relevant interactions with 
inhibitors and inducers of UGT1A9. Potent in vivo inhibitors of UGT1A9 seem to be rare. The UGT1A9 
inhibitor mefenamic acid caused partial inhibition of UGT1A9 resulting in a 55% mean increase in 
dapagliflozin AUC. This interaction is not considered clinically relevant. Theoretically a larger effect 
could be expected by a more potent inhibition of UGT1A9. However, more potent clinically used 
UGT1A9 inhibitors are not known. Hence, clinically relevant interactions with UGT1A9 inhibitors are not 
expected.  
There are few examples of induction of UGT1A9 in the literature and the mechanism for induction is 
not fully clear. It therefore seems difficult to predict or evaluate the potential for clinically relevant 
interactions with UGT1A9 inducers. Concomitant administration of rifampicin, a metabolizing enzyme 
inducer, for 6 days resulted in a weak reduction in dapagliflozin AUC, which is not considered clinically 
relevant. The effect may be slightly larger upon longer co-administration (as maximum induction 
probably has not been reached by Day 6). However, a clinically relevant interaction seems unlikely. 
The pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin was evaluated in 8 phase-I studies. Potential PD interactions 
were evaluated in 4 additional studies. A further study aimed at investigating dapagliflozin’s effect on 
QT interval.  
The steady-state 24-h urinary glucose excretion is highly dependent on renal function and serum 
glucose concentrations. The minimal effective dose was determined to be 0.3 mg qd and maximal 
urinary glucose excretion was observed at doses ≥ 20 mg/day in subjects with T2DM and normal renal 
function. At a dose of 10 mg qd, the rate of urinary glucose excretion at steady-state was constant 
over 24 h, indicating that this dose is equally effective over the entire dosing interval and that once 
daily dosing of 10 mg dapagliflozin is appropriate. The 10 mg dose is also supported by population-
based integrated modelling and simulation analysis.

Concerns arose from the finding of increased renal sodium and fluid loss, particularly when 
dapagliflozin is co-administered with diuretics. Elderly patients may be especially vulnerable to relevant 
dehydration and potential sequelae. Adequate warnings have been included in the SmPC in addition to 
the recommendation to reduce the dose when dapagliflozin is given in combination with loop diuretics. 
No significant effect on urinary calcium was observed in the phase I and phase II studies but variability 
in daily calcium excretion was rather high. 
Dapagliflozin did not show a clinically relevant influence on human cardiac repolarisation.  
Dapagliflozin with or without co-administered loop diuretics may be associated with modest BP-
reducing effects, which would be interesting to evaluate in hypertensive patients. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin has been well documented. Dapagliflozin has a 
pharmacokinetic profile with low potential for interactions and moderate influence of intrinsic factors on 
its PK. Exposure differences based on gender, age (up to 70 years), weight, race, mild renal 
impairment, mild and moderate hepatic impairment, UGT1A9 genotype, concomitant administration of 
UGT1A9 inhibitor were estimated to be on average less than 40% and were not considered clinically 
relevant. In severe hepatic impairment dapagliflozin’s exposure was on average increased by 67%, and 
it cannot be excluded that some patients may have more than a 2-fold increase in exposure. Hence, an 
(initial) dose reduction to 5 mg is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
The pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin indicates that this compound is potentially efficient in the 
treatment of diabetes. The pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin is considered to be adequately 
characterised by the studies performed in phase I, particularly for white/black American subjects 
(healthy and with T2DM). The results of these studies are appropriately reflected in the SmPC. The 
dependence on sufficient GFR to obtain an effect of dapagliflozin has implications on the target 
population. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with diuretics have been identified with an increased risk of 
hypotension/hypovolaemia and adequate warnings have been included in the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Dose selection for the phase III clinical program was based primarily on the results of two pivotal dose 
response trials. In addition, 1 supportive trial was conducted. The primary endpoint was HbA1c at 12 
weeks. 
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 51/170 
 
 
The dapagliflozin doses for the Phase IIb studies MB102008 and MB102009 were selected based on 
findings from the Phase I and IIa program. Doses with acceptable safety margins were selected (2.5 
mg to 50 mg) based on results from nonclinical and clinical data: in MB102008, dapagliflozin doses 2.5 
mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg were included, whereas in study MB102009 the 10 mg and 20 
mg doses were included. Based on a 12.5 hour half life, dapagliflozin was dosed once-daily.  
The dapagliflozin doses 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg were chosen for the study D1692C00005, the 
Japanese Phase IIb study. PK and PD results were comparable between US and Japanese subjects in 
Phase I studies. The dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg was included to match the global Phase III doses. In 
addition, the 1 mg dose was included in this study to evaluate the lower end of the dose interval. The 
Applicant’s justification for the selection of doses brought on to the phase III program is acceptable 
and supported by the results of the Phase I and II studies. 
Study populations differed somewhat between the Phase II studies with patients in study MB102008 
being more obese and with diabetes of shorter duration than in study D1692C00005. Subjects included 
in study MB102009 had more advanced diabetes.

Study MB102008 
There was a significant reduction in HbA1C from baseline to Week 12 in all dapagliflozin groups as 
compared with placebo. All dapagliflozin doses were effective at lowering HbA1C, but no log-linear 
dose response relationship (secondary objective) was demonstrated within the dose range of 2.5 mg to 
50 mg (p-value for trend = 0.4139).  
There was a significantly greater reduction from baseline to Week 12 in FPG in all dapagliflozin 
treatment groups as compared with placebo, except for the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg group. The decrease 
in FPG appeared to be dose related. A reduction in postprandial glucose AUC (exploratory objective) 
was also achieved in the dapagliflozin treatment groups compared with the placebo group, but did not 
show dose dependence. 
Change in total body weight was assessed as an exploratory variable. Reductions in total body weight 
at Week 12 were observed across all treatment groups; the reduction was larger in the dapagliflozin-
treated groups than in the placebo group and was greatest in the dapagliflozin 20 mg and 50 mg 
treatment groups. The placebo-corrected mean body weight reductions were -1.52 kg, -1.38 kg, -
1.54 kg, -2.25 kg and -2.24 kg in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg treatment 
groups, respectively. 
Study D1692C00005  
Statistically significant greater mean reductions in HbA1c from baseline to Week 12 were achieved in 
all dapagliflozin groups compared with the placebo group. The greatest reductions were observed in 
the dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups (at least 0.5% placebo-corrected reduction).  
Statistically significant greater reductions in FPG were also achieved in all dapagliflozin groups 
compared with placebo and the effect appeared to be dose-dependent.  
Numerically greater proportions of subjects achieved therapeutic glycaemic response, defined as 
HbA1c <7%, in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg treatment groups, though the differences 
versus placebo were not statistically significant. 
Study MB102009 
This study explored the feasibility of lowering the insulin dose before starting dapagliflozin treatment in 
subjects with T2DM treated aggressively but not controlled on combination antihyperglycaemic therapy 
with metformin and/or TZD and insulin. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed. As per 
protocol, TDDI was reduced by 50% prior to treatment but could be up-titrated to achieve glycaemic 
control according to pre-specified criteria. Up-titration of TDDI occurred in 4/23 subjects in the placebo 
group and in 4/48 subjects in the dapagliflozin groups. 
Dapagliflozin 10 mg and 20 mg appeared to be effective in lowering HbA1c. In spite of a reduction in 
the insulin dose by 50% at baseline, subjects in the placebo arm experienced little change in HbA1c, 
an outcome that likely reflects the relatively severe insulin resistance in these subjects and perhaps 
improved compliance with diet and lifestyle as a result of study participation. An apparent dose-
dependent mean reduction from baseline in FPG from baseline at Week 12 versus placebo was 
observed. 
Numerically greater mean reductions from baseline in body weight at Week 12 were observed in each 
dapagliflozin-treated group compared to the placebo group. Mean weight reduction in the dapagliflozin 
treatment groups appeared to be progressive and continuous through Week 12. 
The strategy tested was not used in the pivotal add-on to insulin study.

Rationale for dose selection in the Phase III program 
Doses ranging from 1 mg to 10 mg were selected for the phase III program. Higher doses were 
associated with more adverse events, i.e. hyperphosphataemia and genitourinary infections, and thus 
the benefit risk for these doses was considered negative. This strategy was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP and is also in line with the Scientific Advice recommendations. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
General issues applying to all studies 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Males and females ≥18 years of age were eligible, and there was no upper age limit unless metformin 
was a background therapy, in which case the upper age limit was 77 years (due to the increased risk 
of renal impairment). In study D1690C00012, which included assessments of bone mineral density, 
post-menopausal women aged ≥55 and ≤75 years and men aged ≥30 and ≤75 years were eligible to 
avoid factors that could confound bone mineral density assessments.  
Subjects with BMI ≥45 kg/m2 were excluded from the majority of Phase III studies because of the 
potential for pathological causes of obesity in this population. 
Subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment were included in the Phase III studies; because the 
efficacy of dapagliflozin was expected to be reduced in subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR 
<30mL/min/1.73m2), these patients were excluded. One study (MB102029) exclusively enrolled 
subjects with moderate renal impairment.  
Subjects at advanced stages of T2DM, such as those with chronic complications of T2DM (retinopathy, 
neuropathy, mild nephropathy, or chronic CV disease) were generally not excluded. Subjects with 
significant hepatic disease, unstable cardiovascular disease including Class III and IV heart failure, 
pregnant and breastfeeding women and paediatric subjects were excluded. 
Eligibility criteria for the Phase III studies were selected to include inadequately controlled T2DM 
subjects with a wide range of baseline HbA1c values. Studies MB102021 and MB102034, the initial 
combination therapy studies, enrolled subjects with HbA1c ≥7.5 % and ≤12.0%. Additionally, study 
MB102013 included open label dapagliflozin treatment arms (without a placebo control) enrolling 
subjects with baseline HbA1c ≥10.1 and < 12.0%. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered appropriate. Due to expected lack of efficacy, 
patients with severe renal impairment have been excluded from the phase III studies. In one study 
(MB 102029) specifically patients with moderate renal impairment were investigated. Patients with 
more severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from the studies. Furthermore, patients were to 
have normal calcium levels at inclusion. Due to the use of metformin in many of the studies, the 
possibility to include elderly patients was limited.

Treatments 
The dapagliflozin doses administered in all of the Phase III studies are summarized in the table below. 
The dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg doses were administered as fixed daily doses in four of the 
11 Phase III studies (MB102013 [Group 1], MB102014, D1690C00005, and D1690C00006). Study 
MB102013 compared once-daily dosing of dapagliflozin with either the morning (AM) or evening (PM) 
meal. Other studies specified either morning or evening administration of study drug, or did not specify 
the timing of drug administration.

the active comparator, glipizide.

Subjects who failed to meet pre-specified glycaemic targets (which became more stringent as the trials 
progressed) received rescue medication, which varied from study to study, and included metformin, 
pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, sitagliptin, acarbose, and SU. In study D1690C00006, the add-on to insulin 
study, and partially in study MB102029 (in subjects with moderate renal impairment) rescue consisted 
of insulin up titration. In study D1690C00004, the active comparator study, there was no rescue 
medication. 
The Phase III program thus explored a range of doses. The choice of doses in the different settings has 
been adequately justified.  
Objectives 
All Phase 3 studies, except the active comparator study (study D1690C00004) and the body 
composition study (study D1690C00012), were aimed at showing superiority with regards to HbA1c for 
dapagliflozin compared to placebo at 24 weeks. The active comparator study aimed at showing non-
inferiority with regards to HbA1c for dapagliflozin compared to glipizide at 52 weeks. A predefined delta 
of 0.35 % was chosen. The body composition study had the primary objective of showing superiority 
with regards to weight reduction for dapagliflozin compared to placebo at 24 weeks. 
The primary objectives were endorsed by the CHMP. The chosen delta could be considered somewhat 
generous; however, this delta has been accepted in previous studies and was therefore considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in 9 of the 11 Phase 3 studies was change from baseline in HbA1c to 
Week 24. For Study D1690C00004, the primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c 
to Week 52, and for Study D1690C00012, change in total body weight to Week 24. 
Other efficacy endpoints evaluated include but were not limited to FPG, PPG, the proportion of subjects 
achieving a therapeutic response of HbA1c<7.0% (and < 6.5), and change from baseline in body 
weight.  
D1690C00012 evaluated changes in weight as the primary endpoint, as well as changes in body 
composition (by DXA and magnetic resonance imaging) in overweight subjects with T2DM.  
Sample size 
Sample size calculations were made for all studies. The calculations are considered adequate. 
Randomisation 
Different randomisation procedures were used in the studies. In some of the studies a web based 
response system was used. 
Several Phase III studies included stratified randomization to ensure adequate representation of 
certain patient characteristics, such as gender and background medication, and to ensure even 
distribution of subjects across treatment groups. 
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 56/170 
 
 
Stratification at randomization for background therapy was included in 3 Phase III studies: MB102030, 
D1690C00006, and MB102029. In study MB102030, the add-on to TZD study, randomization was 
stratified by pre-enrolment anti-hyperglycaemic therapy (Group 1: pioglitazone 30 or 45 mg/day; 
Group 2: other eligible therapies including diet and exercise). Randomization of subjects from Group 2 
was limited to approximately 67% of the total number of subjects. In study D1690C00006, the add-on 
to insulin study, randomization was stratified into two groups: subjects taking OADs, and subjects not 
taking OADs at baseline. Subjects taking insulin plus OAD were not to exceed 60% of the total number 
of subjects. The following four strata were defined for study MB102029, the "renal impairment study", 
based on pre-enrolment therapy: insulin-based regimen, SU-based regimen, TZD-based regimen, or 
other regimen. 
Study D1690C00012, the body weight/composition study, was stratified by gender, and neither gender 
was to exceed 60% of the total number of randomized subjects. Subject randomization was stratified 
by site in studies MB102013 and MB102032 (monotherapy studies), MB102014 (add-on to metformin 
study) and MB102021 and MB102034 (initial combination studies). 
The randomisation procedures were considered acceptable. 
Blinding (masking) 
The short-term period of all studies was double-blinded. The long-term extension treatment period was 
site- and subject-blinded, with the exception of study MB102029, where both the short term treatment 
period (24 weeks) and the first long-term extension treatment period (28 weeks) were double blinded. 
The blinding procedures were considered acceptable. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyze the primary and all continuous secondary 
endpoints. A modified logistic regression was used for dichotomous secondary endpoints (e.g. 
proportion of responders). The primary endpoint in each study was evaluated by comparing the 
difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline between the dapagliflozin treatment group(s) 
and the comparator group(s), adjusting for multiple treatment comparisons in most cases with 
Dunnett’s method. 
Statistical testing of secondary efficacy endpoints proceeded in a sequential manner using alpha=0.05 
tests for only those treatment groups found to be statistically significant in the primary efficacy 
analysis (an exception to this rule is study D1690C00012 where Hochberg’s method was used). For 
each study, the number and order of secondary endpoints was specified prior to breaking of the blind.  
Missing data from the short term period were handled in main analyses using LOCF methodology, 
excluding data obtained after rescue (except study D1690C00004 where no rescue was used and study 
D1690C00012 where the primary efficacy variable was weight change). Robustness of study 
conclusions was evaluated with respect to the primary endpoint through sensitivity analyses by (i) 
including versus excluding data after rescue, (ii) using observed values versus LOCF values, (iii) 
employing a longitudinal model versus visit specific analyses, and/or (iv) excluding major protocol 
violators versus including all randomized and treated subjects. Generally, confirmatory analyses for the 
short-term period of studies were based on LOCF values while exploratory analyses from the short-
term plus long-term periods were based on observed values.  
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 57/170 
 
 
Long-term efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin was evaluated over the entire duration of the short-term 
combined with the long-term treatment period (and extension period if applicable). No p-values were 
calculated for long-term efficacy analyses as they were considered exploratory. Analyses were based 
on observed data without application of LOCF, to avoid carrying forward data over long periods of time. 
For continuous endpoints, a longitudinal repeated measures model was used. 
The statistical methods used for sample size calculations and data analyses were considered adequate.

Specific issues applying to studies MB102013 and MB102032: monotherapy studies 
Studies MB102013 and MB102032 are two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group studies with the primary objective to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 different 
doses (2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg for study MB102013 and 1 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg for study 
MB102032) of dapagliflozin as monotherapy in patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic 
control with diet and exercise.  
Methods 
Study Participants  
85 sites for study MB102013 enrolled subjects in the United States, in Canada, Mexico and Russia. 
Males and females with T2DM, ≥ 18 to ≤ 77 years old, who were drug naive and had inadequate 
glycaemic control, defined as HbA1c ≥ 7% and ≤ 10% for Group 1 and ≥ 10.1% and ≤ 12.0% for 
Group 2, BMI ≤ 45.0 kg/m2 at enrolment. 
80 sites for study MB102032 enrolled subjects in the United States, in Canada and Latin America. 
Males and females with T2DM, ≥ 18 to ≤ 77 years old, who were drug naive (defined as subjects who 
never or < 24 weeks received antidiabetics since diagnosis) and had inadequate glycaemic control, 
defined as HbA1c ≥ 7% and ≤ 10, BMI ≤ 45.0 kg/m2 at enrolment. 
Treatments 
Study MB102013 consists of 4 periods: a qualification period (up to 14 days), a lead-in period (7 to 14 
days), a short-term double blind treatment period (24 weeks) and a long-term period as follow-up (78 
weeks.  
Group 1: Eligible subjects were randomized to on of 3 doses of dapagliflozin (2.5 mg, 5 mg. 10 mg), 
administered either QAM or QPM, or to placebo treatment.  
Group 2: Eligible subjects were randomized to either dapagliflozin 5 mg QAM or dapagliflozin 10 mg 
QAM. 
Eligible subjects who completed the 24-week short-term treatment period could continue in the long-
term treatment period for 78 weeks on the same blinded study medication. Subjects fulfilling the pre-
defined rescue criteria were eligible to receive open-label rescue medication with metformin.  
Study MB102032 consists of 4 periods: a qualification period (up to 14 days), a lead-in period (14 days 
± 5 days), a short-term double blind treatment period (24 weeks ± 5 days) and a follow-up period (4 
weeks ± 5 days). Eligible subjects received 1, 2.5, or 5 mg of dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin matching 
placebo administered daily with the morning meal during the 24-week treatment period. Subjects 
fulfilling the pre-defined rescue criteria were eligible to receive open-label rescue medication with 
metformin.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of studies MB102013 and MB102032 was to compare the change from baseline 
in HbA1c achieved with each dose of dapagliflozin (2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg in study MB102013 and 1 
mg, 2.5 mg or 5 mg in study MB102032, administered once daily) versus placebo after 24 weeks of 
oral administration of double-blind treatment.

Sample size 
For study MB102013, with 67 subjects per treatment group with post-baseline measurements, there 
was 90% power to detect a difference in means of 0.7% between each dapagliflozin QAM dosing 
treatment group and the placebo group, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1%. Assuming that 
5% of subjects would not have a post-baseline assessment, a total of 490 subjects (70 subjects per 
treatment group), with enrollment HbA1c between 7.0% to 10.0% inclusive, needed to be randomized 
to dapagliflozin AM dosing, dapagliflozin PM dosing or placebo.  
For study MB102032, with 67 subjects per treatment group with post-baseline measurements, there 
was 90% power to detect a difference in means of 0.7% between each dapagliflozin treatment group 
(1 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg) and placebo, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1%. Assuming that 
5% of subjects did not have a post-baseline assessment, a total of 280 subjects (70 subjects per 
treatment group) needed to be randomized.

Recruitment 
Study MB102013 was conducted from 19 September 2007 until 10 February 2009 until 30 July 2010. 
Study MB102032 was conducted from 22 September 2008 until 06 January 2010.  
Conduct of the study 
There were 4 amendments to the original protocol for study MB102013 and 3 for study MB102032 
which were considered acceptable. 
Baseline data 
For study MB102013, the mean age was 52.6 years, 86% were less than 65 years old, 52.8% were 
female, 52.9% were from North America, 34.3% from Latin America and 12.9% from Europe; More 
subjects in both dapagliflozin 10 mg groups (QAM and QPM) were < 65 years old than in the other 
groups. Mean weight was 90.19 kg. The overall mean duration of T2DM was 1.73 years (median < 6 
months). The overall mean baseline HbA1c was 7.9% (Min 6.2%/ Max 12.2%). The baseline mean FPG 
was 162.7 mg/dL. Overall, the mean baseline estimated GFR in the placebo group (86.4 mL/min/1.73 
m2) and dapagliflozin groups (83.3 to 89.0 mL/min/1.73 m2) were similar. More than half of the 
subjects (55.7%) had mild renal impairment at baseline.

In study MB102032, more than 80% of subjects were less than 65 years of age and were White, 50% 
were male. Overall 90.8% had a BMI of ≥ 25 kg/m2, 77.7% had a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 and 60.6% of ≥ 
30 kg/m2. Mean baseline weight was 86.90 kg, it was slightly lower for subjects in the dapagliflozin 
2.5 and 5 mg treatment groups than in the dapagliflozin 1 mg and placebo treatment groups. The 
geographic distribution of the subjects was North America (33.3%/N=94), Latin America 
(28.0%/N=79), and Europe (27.7%/N=78), while 11.0% (N=31) of the subjects were from 
Asia/Pacific region. The mean duration of T2DM was 1.38 years (range 0.0 to 22.5 years). Most 
subjects had been diagnosed with T2DM for < 3 years. The overall mean baseline HbA1c was 7.9% 
(ranking between 7.80% for both PLA and Dapa 1mg and 8.11% for Dapa 2.5mg). Baseline mean FPG 
(158.5 mg/dL) was similar across the treatment groups. Baseline renal function was similar across all 
treatment groups. More than half (54.3%) the subjects had glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) in the 
range of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Figure 4.  HbA1c (%), adjusted mean change from baseline at Week 24 (LOCF), excluding 
data after rescue - Phase III placebo-controlled monotherapy studies (MB102013 
and MB102032), Efficacy Analysis Data Set 
A moderate but clinically relevant placebo-corrected decrease in HbA1c was observed in the 5 and 10 
mg treated groups in study MB102013, whereas clinically relevant changes was seen for all doses 
tested in study MB102032. Baseline HbA1c was essentially similar between the two studies; however, 
patients in study MB102032 had somewhat lower body weight than patients in study MB102013. A 
dose-dependent decrease in HbA1c was observed in both studies. 
Other glycaemic variables 
The secondary endpoints all supported the outcome of the primary endpoint. 
FPG change from baseline 
In both monotherapy studies, treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in significant reductions in FPG 
change from baseline at Week 24 compared to placebo. The effect of dapagliflozin treatment on FPG 
appeared to be dose dependent and was consistent with the effect on the primary endpoint, HbA1c.  
PPG (liquid meal) change from baseline  
Change from baseline in 2-hour PPG after MTT at 24 weeks was a secondary endpoint in study 
MB102032. There was a statistically significant difference versus placebo for all three dapagliflozin 
dose groups, with the greatest reduction observed in the 5 mg group; this dose effect is in contrast to 
2-hour PPG after OGTT results in the add-on combination therapy studies D1690C00005 and 
MB102030, where a dose-dependent effect was not observed. 
Proportion of subjects achieving therapeutic glycaemic response 
The proportions of subjects achieving therapeutic glycaemic response, defined as HbA1c<7% were 
numerically higher in all dapagliflozin treatment groups compared to placebo at Week 24 (LOCF) in 
both monotherapy studies.

Discontinuations or rescue for failing to achieve pre-specified glycaemic targets 
Analyses of subjects who required rescue or were discontinued due to failure to achieve glycaemic 
control were performed as additional supportive measures of efficacy. According to the study protocols, 
rescue for failing to meet glycaemic targets preceded discontinuation for lack of glycaemic control. As a 
result, most subjects were rescued and few required discontinuation.

In study MB102013, by 24 weeks, the cumulative proportion of subjects in Group 1 rescued was 
greatest in the placebo and dapagliflozin 2.5 mg groups. No subjects in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group 
were rescued. Results were similar for the overall proportion of subjects discontinued or rescued for 
failing to achieve pre-specified glycaemic targets by Week 24 when adjusted for baseline HbA1c. By 24 
weeks, the cumulative proportion of subjects in Group 2 rescued was similar between the 5 mg and 
10 mg QAM groups. 
In study MB102032, at Week 24, the cumulative proportion of subjects rescued over time was greater 
in the placebo group than those in the dapagliflozin 1 mg, 2.5, and 5 mg groups. Results were similar 
for the overall proportion of subjects discontinued or rescued for failing to achieve pre-specified 
glycaemic targets by Week 24. 
Variables related to body weight and body composition in treatment naïve subjects  
Change in total body weight at 24 weeks was a secondary efficacy variable in studies MB102013 and 
MB102032. In study MB102013, treatment with dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg resulted in 
numerical, but not statistically significant, decreases in body weight compared to placebo. The placebo 
effect was greater than expected in this study based on results in other dapagliflozin monotherapy 
studies. The data suggest that the patients included in this study were less well compliant with the diet 
and exercise regimen as a larger decrease in HbA1c was also observed in this group. In study 
MB102032 there was a significant decrease in body weight in subjects treated with dapagliflozin 1 mg, 
2.5 mg and 5 mg compared to placebo. In neither of the studies was there any apparent dose 
relationship.

Ancillary analyses 
Data from the long-term extension of the monotherapy study MB102013 was submitted during the 
procedure. Out of 408 originally included patients 294 completed the study. The data indicate a 
maintained effect over the 102 week study period in patients not needing rescue therapy. At 102 
weeks the number of drop-outs was comparable between all groups. 
Figure 6.  HbA1c (%)Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline Over Time, Short-term 
Plus Long-term Treatment Period, Excluding Data After Rescue, 
Randomized Subjects (MB102013 ST + LT) 
In the time to rescue analysis in patients on monotherapy, a difference was observed between 
dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg compared to placebo and dapagliflozin 2.5 mg during the first 36 weeks of 
the study with a lower risk of failure in the 5 and 10 mg treated groups. After 36 weeks there appears 
to be an increase in the risk of failure in the higher dose groups.  
The available overall controlled data up to 102 weeks on dapagliflozin are deemed sufficient to support 
the proposed first-line indication.

Treatments 
Study MB102014 consists of 4 periods: a qualification period (up to 14 days), a lead-in period (14 
days), a short-term double blind treatment period (24 weeks) and a long-term treatment period (78 
weeks). Eligible subjects received treatment with 2.5, 5 or 10 mg of dapagliflozin daily or placebo. 
Open-label metformin background therapy had to remain unchanged. Subjects were to take study drug 
in the morning, 1 hour (or at least 30 minutes) prior to the morning meal. Open-label metformin could 
be split between AM and PM as required. Eligible subjects who completed the 24-week short-term 
treatment period could continue in the long-term treatment period for 78 weeks on the same blinded 
study medication. The rescue medication for this study was pioglitazone 15 mg and was to be taken 
with the morning meal. Alternatively, acarbose could have been used. 
Study D1690C0005 consists of 6 periods: a one week enrolment period, an 8 weeks open-label 
glimepiride lead-in period, a one week qualification period, a 24 weeks double-blind treatment period, 
a 24 weeks double-blind extension period and a 3 weeks follow-up period. Eligible patients were 
randomized to receive either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg of dapagliflozin or placebo, to be taken once 
daily in the morning immediately before or with a meal. Background therapy with glimepiride had to 
remain stable except for down titration (to 2 or even 0 mg) due to hypoglycaemia. Rescue therapy 
(metformin, pioglitazone or rosiglitazone) could be administered to subjects fulfilling rescue criteria 
during the 24-week double-blind treatment period and the 24-week double-blind extension period. 
Study MB102030 consists of 5 periods: a qualification period (up to 14 days), a 10 weeks TZD dose 
optimization period, followed by a 14 days single-blind lead-in period, a 24 weeks double-blind short-
term period and a 24 weeks single-blind long-term period.  
Dose optimization period (only subjects of Group2): Subjects in Group 2 discontinued their original 
antidiabetic therapy, if applicable, and started on pioglitazone at 30 mg/d for 6 weeks with a 
subsequent increase to 45 mg/d (if tolerated) for the next 4 weeks before entering the lead-in phase. 
Patients of group 1 directly entered the lead-in phase. 
Short-term treatment period (24 weeks): Eligible patients (pre-randomisation HbA1c ≥ 7.0 and ≤ 
10.5%) were randomized to receive 5 mg or 10 mg of dapagliflozin or placebo. Subjects were to take 
study drug daily with the morning meal. Open-label pioglitazone was to be taken daily at an 
unchanged dose. 
Long-term treatment period (24 weeks): Subjects who completed the 24-week short-term treatment 
period could continue in the long-term treatment period on their randomized blinded study medication.  
Rescue medication: Subjects meeting rescue criteria could receive open-label rescue medication with 
metformin or sulfonylurea.  
Study D1690C00006 consists of 3 periods: a 24 weeks short-term treatment period followed by 2 
extension periods of 24 weeks and 56 weeks respectively.  
Subjects were randomized to receive dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or placebo as add-on therapy 
to insulin with or without additional use of 1 or 2 OADs for the 24-week double-blind treatment period 
and the 24-week long-term double-blind extension period I. Subsequently, subjects randomized to 
placebo, dapagliflozin 2.5 or 10 mg continued their treatment without change in the 56-weeks 
extension period II, while subjects randomized to dapagliflozin 5 mg switched to dapagliflozin 10 mg.

Subjects meeting pre-defined FPG criteria could have up-titration of insulin, defined as an increase in 
mean daily insulin dose that meets both of the following criteria: the increase in insulin dose is more 
than 5 IU (i.e. 6 IU or greater) and the increase in insulin dose is greater that 10% of the baseline 
insulin dose (baseline insulin dose is calculated daily mean insulin dose documented at visit 2, week 0).  
Objectives 
The primary objective of study MB102014 was to compare the change from baseline in HbA1c achieved 
with each dose of dapagliflozin plus metformin versus placebo plus metformin after 24 weeks of oral 
administration of double-blind treatment. 
The primary objective of study D1690C00005 was to compare the change from baseline in HbA1c 
achieved with each dose of dapagliflozin plus glimepiride versus placebo plus glimepiride after 24 
weeks of oral administration of double-blind treatment. 
The primary objective of study MB102030 was to compare the change from baseline in HbA1c achieved 
with each dose of dapagliflozin plus pioglitazone versus placebo plus pioglitazone after 24 weeks of oral 
administration of double-blind treatment. 
The primary objective of study D1690C00006 was to compare the change from baseline in HbA1C 
achieved with each dose of dapagliflozin plus insulin versus placebo plus insulin after 24 weeks of oral 
administration of double-blind treatment.  
Sample size 
For study MB102014, with 129 subjects per treatment group with post-baseline measurements, there 
was 90% power to detect a difference in means of 0.5% between each dapagliflozin plus metformin 
treatment group and the placebo plus metformin group, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1%. 
Assuming that 5% of subjects did not have a post-baseline assessment, a total of 544 subjects (136 
subjects per treatment group) needed to be randomized. 
For study D1690C00005, each pair-wise treatment group comparison was tested at a significance level 
of approximately 0.019, according to Dunnett’s method, in order to maintain an overall type I error 
rate ≤0.050 for the primary objective. To detect a difference of 0.5% between each dapagliflozin group 
versus placebo for changes in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24, assuming a SD =1.1%, and at a two-
sided significance level of 0.019, 129 evaluable subjects were needed in each treatment group to 
provide 90% power. Assuming that 5% of the subjects would not be evaluable in the Full Analysis Set, 
136 subjects per treatment group (544 subjects total) were planned for randomization. 
For study MB102030, with 132 subjects per treatment group with post-baseline measurements, there 
is at least 92% power to detect a difference in means of 0.5% between each of the dapagliflozin plus 
pioglitazone treatment groups vs. the placebo plus pioglitazone treatment group at a two-sided 
significance level of 0.027, using Dunnett’s adjustment and assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 
1.1%. Assuming that 5% of subjects do not have a post baseline assessment, a total of 417 subjects 
(139 subjects per treatment group) needed to be randomized. With a total of 278 subjects randomized 
to dapagliflozin (5 mg and 10 mg) plus pioglitazone, 200 subjects will have 48 weeks of exposure to 
dapagliflozin (5 mg and 10 mg) plus pioglitazone, assuming a dropout rate of 15% every 6 months.

Each pair-wise treatment group comparison was to be tested at a significance level of approximately 
0.019, according to Dunnett’s method, in order to maintain an overall type I error rate <0.050 for the 
primary objective. To detect a difference of 0.5% between each dapagliflozin group versus placebo for 
changes from baseline to week 24 in HbA1c, assuming a SD = 1.2%, and at a two-sided significance 
level of 0.019, 153 evaluable subjects were needed in each treatment group to provide 90% power. 
Assuming that 5% of the subjects were not evaluable in the full analysis set, 161 subjects per 
treatment group (644 subjects total) were planned for randomization (808 were randomized). 
Originally, around 1600 subjects were planned to be enrolled but the number was decreased due to a 
lower screening failure rate than anticipated.

Table 15.  Study MB102030:  Subjects disposition – 24 week double-blind treatment period 
Study D1690C00006 
In total, 1240 subjects were enrolled out of which 808 were randomized. The most common reason for 
not being randomized was not fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and fulfilling at least one exclusion 
criterion (396 subjects). More than 85% of the subjects completed the short-term treatment period 
and more than 80% of the subjects completed the long-term extension period I. The most common 
reasons for not completing the periods were withdrawal of consent and occurrence of an AE.

Outcomes and estimation 
HbA1c change from baseline  
The Phase III placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies included MB102014 (add-on to 
metformin study), D1690C00005 (add-on to SU study), MB102030 (add-on to TZD study), and 
D1690C00006 (add-on to insulin ± OAD study). The 5 mg and 10 mg dapagliflozin doses were included 
in all four studies, while the 2.5 mg dapagliflozin dose was included in all studies with the exception of 
MB102030. In the four studies, treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in significant reductions in HbA1c 
at Week 24 versus placebo that appeared to be dose dependent. Treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg 
consistently demonstrated HbA1c reductions of at least 0.5% in each of the four studies; the 2.5 mg 
and 5 mg doses provided statistically significant but lesser degrees of HbA1c reduction.

Figure 8.  HbA1c (%) adjusted mean change from baseline at Week 24 (LOCF), excluding 
data after rescue - Phase III add-on combination therapy studies (MB102014, 
D1690C00005, MB102030, and D1690C000006), Efficacy Analysis Data Set 
Studies MB102030 and D1690C00006 included stratification of subpopulations at randomization. Study 
MB102030 was stratified according to baseline OAD use; no signal for potential treatment interaction 
for the primary efficacy variable was observed in a subgroup analysis based on enrolment strata. In 
study D1690C00006, which was stratified according to background OAD therapy, the effect of 
dapagliflozin was similar in subjects who were treated with insulin alone and in subjects who were 
treated with both insulin and an OAD. 
The results of longitudinal repeated measures analyses of HbA1c at Week 24, either excluding or 
including data after rescue, were consistent with the results of the primary efficacy analysis. In studies 
MB102014, D1690C00005 and MB102030, slightly smaller differences were generally seen between 
dapagliflozin doses and placebo when data after rescue were included, whereas in study 
D1690C00006, results were similar whether data after rescue were included or excluded. 
Thus a clinically relevant add-on effect of the 10 mg dose on HbA1c was observed in all add-on 
studies. 
Other glycaemic variables  
The secondary endpoints all supported the outcome of the primary endpoint. 
FPG change from baseline 
FPG change from baseline at Week 24 was a secondary variable in all add-on combination therapy 
studies. Reductions in FPG from baseline to Week 24 compared to placebo were observed for all 
dapagliflozin treatment groups across the add-on combination studies. Comparisons with placebo were 
statistically significant except for the 2.5 mg group in study D1690C00005 and the 5 mg group in 
study D1690C00006 for which formal statistical testing was not performed based on the hierarchical 
closed testing procedure; however, nominal p-values were generated. The reductions were numerically 
similar at each dose across all studies and appeared to be dose ordered.

PPG change from baseline  
Change in 2-hour PPG levels as a response to an OGTT from baseline to Week 24 was a secondary 
variable in studies D1690C00005 and MB102030. 
Dapagliflozin lowered 2-hour PPG levels as a response to an OGTT from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF), 
compared to placebo, across all dapagliflozin groups in both studies. This effect was more pronounced 
in study MB102030, likely due to a higher baseline mean PPG in this study (293.6 mg/dL) compared to 
study D1690C00005 (158.6 mg/dL). For the 2.5 mg group in study D1690C00005, formal statistical 
testing was not performed based on the hierarchical closed testing procedure (nominal p-value 
calculated). There was no clear dose relationship for the dapagliflozin effect on PPG within either study, 
in contrast to PPG after MTT results in study MB102032, where a dose-dependent effect was observed.  
Proportion of subjects achieving therapeutic glycaemic response 
The proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response defined as HbA1c <7.0% was a 
secondary endpoint in studies MB102014, D1690C00005 and MB102030 and an exploratory endpoint 
in study D1690C00006.  
Treatment with dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg led to a statistically significantly greater proportion of 
subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response defined as HbA1c <7.0% in studies MB102014, 
D1690C00005 and MB102030, in which this was a pre-specified secondary variable. Statistical 
significance was not reached for the 2.5 mg dose in any of the studies. In study D1690C00005, formal 
statistical testing was not performed for the 2.5 mg dose based on the hierarchical closed testing 
procedure. Similar results were observed for study D1690C00006; only nominal p-values were 
calculated for this exploratory endpoint. The effect was consistent across all four studies and appeared 
to be dose-dependent, with the greatest proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c < 7.0% in the 
dapagliflozin 10 mg groups in each study.  
Insulin dose 
Mean daily insulin dose (adjusted mean change from baseline at Week 24 (LOCF), including data after 
insulin up-titration) and the proportion of subjects with a decrease of at least 10% in daily insulin dose 
were assessed as secondary endpoints in study D1690C00006. 
Treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in a lower calculated mean daily insulin dose from baseline to 
Week 24 compared to placebo. The change in dose from baseline to 24 weeks (LOCF), compared to 
placebo, was statistically significant for all dapagliflozin groups.  
Most of the reduction in insulin dose in the dapagliflozin groups occurred over the first 8 weeks, while a 
gradual increase in dose over the duration of the 24 weeks was observed in the placebo group. The 
effect was maintained up to 48 weeks as shown by exploratory analyses in the long-term extension 
treatment period. The data show that dapagliflozin appears to have an “insulin saving” effect.

Variables related to body weight and body composition  
Change in total body weight at 24 weeks was a secondary variable in all four placebo-controlled add-on 
combination therapy studies. Across the four add-on combination studies, treatment with dapagliflozin 
2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg overall resulted in statistically significant reductions in body weight 
compared to placebo except for the 2.5 mg dose in study D1690C00005 (add-on to SU), where the 
reductions were not statistically different from placebo. A dose dependent effect was for the most part 
observed in these four studies.

Study D1690C00006 
This study had a 24-week short-term treatment period with a 24-week double-blind extension period I 
and a 56-week double-blind extension period II incorporating a switch of dapagliflozin 5 to 10 mg 
during extension period II to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5/10 mg, and 10 
mg as add-on therapy to insulin in adult subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate 
glycaemic control. Subjects were randomized to one of the dapagliflozin groups or placebo at a 1:1:1:1 
ratio.

In total 1240 subjects were enrolled in the extension period out of which 808 were randomized. 
Overall, approximately 64% of the subjects completed LT2 and 63% of subjects completed the study. 
One subject in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg group did not complete the study after completing LT2. The 
number of subjects completing the study was higher in the dapagliflozin groups than in the placebo 
group. The most frequent reason for not completing the study was withdrawal of informed consent and 
‘other’. 
At week 104, a mean reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline was observed in all dapagliflozin 
treatment groups using repeated measures analyses and excluding data after insulin up-titration. The 
reductions were clinically significant (differences compared to placebo of more than 0.5%) in the 
dapagliflozin 5/10 and 10 mg groups. The HbA1c reductions from baseline observed in the dapagliflozin 
groups at week 104 were similar to those at week 48, whereas in the placebo group the initial 
reductions in HbA1c observed at weeks 24 and 48 were not observable any longer.

analysis set) (D1690C00006) 
The proportion of subjects who discontinued or received insulin up-titration due to lack of glycaemic 
control prior to or at week 104 was higher in the placebo group (50.4%) than in the dapagliflozin 
groups (29.1% in the 2.5 mg, 26.5% in the 5/10 mg, and 25.5% in the 10 mg groups, percent 
adjusted).

There was no meaningful change in calculated mean daily insulin dose at week 48 compared to 
baseline in the dapagliflozin groups, while in the placebo group, an increase by around 10 IU was 
observed. At week 104, the increase of the calculated mean daily insulin dose in the placebo group 
observed at week 48 had almost doubled, whereas there was only a slight increase in dapagliflozin 2.5 
mg group and the mean insulin dose in the dapagliflozin 5/10 mg and 10 mg groups remained stable.

after insulin up-titration (full analysis set) (D1690C00006) 
The modest weight loss compared to baseline observed in the dapagliflozin groups at week 48 
improved further at week 104, while subjects in the placebo group did not show a meaningful mean 
change in body weight at week 48, and showed a slight increase at week 104. The effect was most 
pronounced in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group. Analysis in subjects completing ST + LT1 confirmed that 
weight loss in the dapagliflozin groups observed at week 48 remained stable over the 56-week second 
extension period (-0.02, -0.10, and -0.01 kg in the 2.5, 5/10, and 10 mg groups, respectively) 
whereas in the placebo group there was a small increase (0.56 kg). 
Seated SBP showed a mean decrease from baseline to week 104 in all treatment groups. Decreases 
were slightly more pronounced in the dapagliflozin 2.5, 5, and 10 mg groups (-5.12, -4.70, and -5.92 
mmHg, respectively) than in the placebo group (-2.05 mmHg) (analyses excluding data after insulin 
up-titration). The effect was maintained from week 48 to week 104 in all dapagliflozin treatment 
groups.

Specific issues applying to study D1690C00004: active comparator study 
Study D1690C00004 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study  
with the primary objective to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin in combination with 
metformin compared with a sulphonylurea in combination with metformin in patients with T2DM who 
have inadequate glycaemic control on metformin therapy alone. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
95 sites enrolled subjects in 10 countries.  
Treatments 
Study D1690C00004 consists of 4 periods: a metformin dose stabilization period (8 weeks), a 2 week 
placebo lead-in, a study drug titration period (18 weeks) after randomization and a maintenance 
period (34 weeks). Eligible patients were randomized to receiving Dapagliflozin or Glipizide or matching 
placebo. In addition, all patients received open-label metformin at a dose of 1500, 2000 or 2500 
mg/day based on his/her metformin dose and other OAD therapy during the last 8 weeks prior to 
enrolment.  Study drug was taken orally, 30 minutes before a meal. Dapagliflozin or matching placebo 
had to be taken once daily and glipizide or placebo had to be taken once (dose levels 1 and 2) or twice 
daily (dose level 3) depending on the dose directed by the investigator.   
During the titration phase, subjects were up-titrated to the optimal effect (FPG <110 mg/dL, <6.1 
mmol/L,) or the highest tolerable dose. All subjects started with the investigational product at dose 
level 1 (dapagliflozin 2.5 mg or glipizide 5 mg). They could be up-titrated in 3 week intervals to dose 
level 2 (dapagliflozin 5 mg or glipizide 10 mg) and 3 (dapagliflozin 10 mg or glipizide 20 mg). During 
the maintenance phase, subjects continued on the dose level they have reached at the end of the 
titration period. At any time during the study, the investigational product could be down-titrated to 
mitigate recurrent hypoglycaemic events. Rescue was not allowed for the 52-week study period.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of study D1690C00004 was to examine whether, after 52 weeks of oral 
administration of double-blind treatment, the absolute change from baseline in HbA1c level with 
dapagliflozin plus metformin was non-inferior to glipizide (sulphonylurea) plus metformin in subjects 
with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control on 1500 mg/day or higher doses of metformin 
therapy alone.

Sample size 
To demonstrate non-inferiority of dapagliflozin in comparison with glipizide as add-on therapy to 
metformin for changes from baseline to week 52 in HbA1c within a non-inferiority margin of 0.35%, 
assuming a standard deviation SD = 1.25%, and at a one-sided significance level of 0.025, 280 
evaluable subjects were needed in each treatment group to provide approximately 90% power (given a 
true difference of zero between the two treatment groups). Assuming a 5% exclusion rate from the full 
analysis set, 295 subjects per treatment group were needed for the full analysis set. Additionally, to 
have 90% power for the per-protocol population, assuming a 25% exclusion rate from the per-protocol 
population, 373 subjects per treatment group (746 subjects total) were planned for randomization. 
In 6-month dapagliflozin studies, a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1% was selected based upon the 
Phase II dapagliflozin study as well as historical data from other diabetes programs. A slightly larger 
SD, 1.25%, was chosen for this study because of the titration regimen for dapagliflozin and the longer 
duration of the trial.

Outcomes and estimation 
HbA1c change from baseline  
D1690C00004, the active comparator study, was the only Phase 3 study to include a dose-titration 
scheme due to dosing recommendations for the active comparator, glipizide. The titration dosing 
strategy also provided an opportunity to assess percentage of subjects reaching the top dose of 
dapagliflozin 10 mg based on FPG measurements and tolerability, when dosing was started at the 
2.5 mg dose level. Subjects who had failed treatment with metformin IR monotherapy were 
randomized 1:1 to glipizide or dapagliflozin (5 mg or 2.5 mg starting dose, respectively), and were up-
titrated over 18 weeks to optimal glycaemic effect (FPG <110 mg/dL) or to the highest dose level (up 
to 20 mg glipizide and 10 mg dapagliflozin) as tolerated. Thereafter, doses were kept constant, except 
for down-titration in the event of hypoglycaemia. At the end of the titration period, 87% of subjects in 
the dapagliflozin group had been titrated to the maximum study dose (10 mg), versus 73% in the 
glipizide group (20 mg). Of those subjects receiving dapagliflozin, 0.5% subsequently required down-
titration, versus 5.1% of subjects receiving glipizide.  
Treatment with either dapagliflozin or glipizide resulted in a mean reduction of 0.52% in HbA1c 
compared to baseline at Week 52. The effect observed for glipizide is acceptable and confirms the 
validity of the study. Dapagliflozin was non-inferior to glipizide for change in HbA1c at Week 52 
according to statistical criteria (non-inferiority margin = 0.35%, with 95% confidence interval 
completely below margin). Although the non-inferiority margin may be considered to be somewhat 
generous, the outcome supports the conclusion that dapagliflozin is non-inferior to glipizide. 
In the dapagliflozin group, most of the HbA1c effect occurred by Week 12, followed by a further slight 
mean decrease until Week 52. In the glipizide group, there was a rapid decrease in HbA1c from 
baseline to Week 18 followed by a reversal in direction until Week 52; this pattern is consistent with 
the glycaemic effect of sulphonylureas in other long-term studies. At Week 52, the mean change from 
baseline in HbA1c was identical in both treatment groups.  
The per-protocol analysis resulted in slightly larger estimated reductions than the primary analysis, 
with mean HbA1c reduction at Week 52 in the dapagliflozin group of -0.55% and -0.56% for the 
glipizide group. The results of longitudinal repeated measures analyses of HbA1c at Week 52 were 
consistent with the results of the primary efficacy analysis. The data on the per-protocol population 
further support that non-inferiority has been shown.

Other glycaemic variables  
Hypoglycaemic events 
A comparison of hypoglycaemic events between dapagliflozin and glipizide was a secondary efficacy 
endpoint in study D1690C00004. There were less than one-tenth as many subjects in the dapagliflozin 
group (3.5%; n=14), compared to the glipizide group (40.8%; n=162), who experienced at least one 
event of hypoglycaemia over 52 weeks of treatment (p <0.0001).  
Glycaemic response 
The proportion of subjects achieving glycaemic response (defined as HbA1c ≤6.5% at Week 52) was 
lower in the dapagliflozin (16.5%) than in the glipizide group (27.5%) as was the proportion of 
subjects who had an HbA1c ≥7% at baseline and <7% at Week 52 (27.4% in the dapagliflozin group 
and 32% in the glipizide group).  
Although a higher percentage of subjects treated with glipizide achieved a therapeutic glycaemic 
response, discontinuations due to lack of glycaemic control were numerically more frequent in the 
glipizide comparator group. One subject in the dapagliflozin group (0.3%) and 15 subjects in the 
glipizide group (3.7%) were discontinued from the study due to lack of glycaemic control. 
Variables related to body weight  
The short term treatment period in study D1690C00004 was 52 weeks. A statistically significant mean 
reduction in body-weight-related variables from baseline to Week 52 compared to glipizide was 
observed in the dapagliflozin treatment group. 
A statistically significant and clinically relevant higher proportion of subjects in the dapagliflozin group 
(33.3%), compared to glipizide (2.5%), had body weight reductions of at least 5% from baseline to 
Week 52. 
Subjects in the dapagliflozin group showed a mean decrease in body weight from baseline to Week 26 
which was sustained through Week 52, while subjects in the glipizide group displayed a mean increase 
in body weight.

A mean body weight decrease of -3.35 kg was observed in subjects with a BMI ≥27 kg/m2 in the 
dapagliflozin group, and a mean increase of 1.41 kg was observed in the glipizide group (nominal p-
value for the difference between dapagliflozin and glipizide <0.0001). These findings were similar to 
the mean weight changes seen in the overall study population. 
This is the only pivotal study where a direct comparison between an established therapy and 
dapagliflozin on body weight is made. The data support a beneficial effect of dapagliflozin on body 
weight. 
Ancillary analyses 
This study had a 52-week short-term treatment period (ST) followed by a 52-week extension period I 
(LT1) and a 104-week extension period II to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin as add-on 
therapy to metformin compared with glipizide as add-on therapy to metformin in adult subjects with 
T2DM. Data from the initial 52 week period was initially provided and final data from 52 week 
extension period I were submitted during the evaluation.

In total, 1217 subjects were enrolled and 816 subjects were randomized. A total of 56.2% and 50.0% 
of subjects in the dapagliflozin and glipizide group, respectively, completed LT1. Most common reasons 
for not completing LT1 were failure to meet the study criteria and withdrawal of consent. 
At week 104, HbA1c showed a larger mean reduction compared to baseline in the dapagliflozin group 
(-0.32%) than in the glipizide group (-0.14%), whereas the mean decrease in HbA1c from baseline to 
week 52 was comparable in both groups when non-inferiority of efficacy of dapagliflozin compared to 
glipizide as add-on therapy to metformin was demonstrated (-0.52% vs. -0.50% in the dapagliflozin 
and glipizide groups, respectively). 
Figure 14.  Adjusted mean change from baseline over time in HbA1c (%) for ST +LT1 (full 
analysis set) 
A total of 56/400 subjects in the dapagliflozin group (14.5%) and 89/401 subjects in the glipizide 
group (21.6%) were discontinued from the study due to lack of glycaemic control. 
Subjects in the dapagliflozin group showed a mean decrease of 3.31 kg in body weight from baseline 
to week 26 after which body weight remained almost stable until week 104. In the glipizide group, a 
mean increase of 1.55 kg in body weight was observed from baseline to week 52, followed by a slight 
mean decrease until week 104. At week 104, the mean change from baseline in body weight was -3.70 
kg in the dapagliflozin group and 1.36 kg in the glipizide group. 
Seated SBP showed a mean decrease from baseline to week 52 in the dapagliflozin group (-3.79 
mmHg) compared to a slight mean increase in the glipizide group (0.93 mmHg). At week 104, the 
group difference was maintained but on a slightly higher level than at week 52 (-2.69 mmHg vs. 1.20 
mmHg change compared to baseline in the dapagliflozin and glipizide groups, respectively). 
Seated DBP showed a slight mean decrease from baseline to week 52 in both treatment groups (-1.30 
mmHg in the dapagliflozin group and -0.43 mmHg in the glipizide group). At week 104, both groups 
showed a comparable reduction in DBP (-1.95 mmHg vs. -1.51 mmHg change compared to baseline in 
the dapagliflozin and glipizide groups, respectively).

Notes 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Summaries were prepared of demographics and baseline characteristics for the pooled monotherapy / 
combination therapy group (MB102013 [QAM and QPM doses combined, excluding Group 2], 
MB102032 [excluding 1 mg], MB102014, MB102030, D1690C00005, D1690C00006, D1690C00012, 
MB102021, and MB102034 [excluding dapagliflozin arm]). The demographic and baseline 
characteristics were generally balanced across the pooled dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 
placebo groups. Overall there were slightly more females than males (pooled total 48.8% males and 
51.2% females) and the mean age ranged between 55.0 and 57.1 years across the pooled treatment 
groups. Mean duration of T2DM ranged from 5.28 years in the pooled placebo group to 7.27 years in 
the pooled dapagliflozin 2.5 mg group; mean HbA1c was lowest in the pooled dapagliflozin 2.5 mg 
group (8.16%) and highest in the pooled dapagliflozin 5 mg group (8.43%).  
In the All Phase 3 studies population, the mean age was 56 years; 1212 (21.3%) subjects were ≥65 
years old and 157 (2.8%) subjects were ≥75 years old. The proportion of males (50.5%) was similar 
to the proportion of females (49.5%). Across all Phase 3 studies 83.7% were white, 3.4% were black 
or African American and 10.2% were Asian. 
Subgroup analyses 
A number of subgroup analyses were performed on the pooled monotherapy / combination therapy 
group. Below is shown the analysis based on HbA1c at baseline. As would be expected, the most 
prominent effect was seen in patients with high baseline values.

A decrease in effect was observed both with decreasing GFR and with increasing age. The data on 
elderly patients is very limited as reflected by the wide CI, however, further analyses provided by the 
Applicant during the evaluation showed that the decreased efficacy observed in the elderly is mainly 
related to a decrease in renal function with age.

A decrease in blood pressure was consistently observed across the study program. This is a beneficial 
effect considering that the majority of patients with T2DM would also have a diagnosis of hypertension.

Comparison of doses 5 mg and 10 mg across the study program 
The results were very consistent among races and geographical regions. This is reassuring and would 
allow extrapolating the results from studies performed in non-European sites to the European 
population.

Clinical studies in special populations  
Study MB102029 
Study MB102029 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomized, 
Phase II/III trial to evaluate the glycaemic efficacy, renal safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin in subjects with T2DM and moderate renal impairment who have

inadequate glycaemic control. The primary objective was to compare the change from baseline in 
HbA1c achieved with each dapagliflozin treatment group versus placebo, after 24 weeks of oral 
administration of double-blind treatment. 
In the 24-week short-term phase, 252 subjects were randomized and treated (84 placebo, 
83 dapagliflozin 5 mg, and 85 dapagliflozin 10 mg). Eligible subjects completing the 24-week short-
term, double-blind treatment period continued into the double-blind, 28-week long-term treatment 
period. Eligible subjects completing the 28-week long-term double-blind treatment period continued 
into the 52-week site and subject blinded long-term extension period (cumulative study data could 
range from 53 to 102 weeks long). In the total long-term phase, 202 subjects were treated (62 
placebo, 71 dapagliflozin 5 mg, and 69 dapagliflozin 10 mg). 
The placebo-corrected HbA1c mean changes from baseline in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg 
treatment groups at Week 24 (LOCF) were not statistically significant. The adjusted mean change from 
baseline in HbA1c showed greater numerical reductions in all dapagliflozin treatment groups than in 
the placebo group. For the secondary endpoint FPG, the adjusted mean change from baseline in FPG at 
Week 24 (LOCF) showed reductions in the dapagliflozin treatment groups compared with an increase in 
the placebo group. These effects on glycaemia occurred in the setting of dapagliflozin-induced 
increments in glucosuria which were proportionately less than those seen in other studies of subjects 
with higher mean eGFR. At Week 24, the overall proportion of subjects discontinued or rescued for 
failing to achieve pre specified glycaemic targets, when adjusted for baseline HbA1c, was numerically 
lower in the dapagliflozin treatment groups at all timepoints compared with the placebo groups. For the 
remaining secondary endpoints, the adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight at Week 24 
(LOCF) showed mean reductions in the dapagliflozin treatment groups compared with an increase in 
the placebo group.

At Week 52, the placebo-corrected reductions in mean HbA1c were slightly larger than at Week 24 in 
the dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg treatment groups. The small placebo-subtracted decreases from baseline 
in mean FPG that were evident at Week 24 persisted at Week 52. During the 52-week treatment 
period, clinically meaningful mean decreases from baseline in total body weight were observed in the 
dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg treatment groups compared with the placebo group, however, statistical 
testing was not performed. 
Post-hoc subgroup analyses 
Given the differences in baseline renal function and the apparent discrepancy between the treatment 
results in MB102029 and the Pooled Monotherapy/Combination Therapy group, exploratory HbA1c 
subgroup analyses were performed for the subsets of subjects with baseline eGFR ≥45 and <60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (performed separately in MB102029 and in the 9-study Pooled 
Monotherapy/Combination Therapy group) and eGFR ≥30 and <45 mL/min/1.73m2 (performed only in 
MB102029). These eGFR categories define lower- and higher- risk subgroups, respectively, of 
moderate renal impairment (stage 3A and 3B renal impairment). 
In the MB102029 analysis, subjects with eGFR ≥45 and <60 mL/min/1.73m2 had placebo-corrected 
adjusted mean HbA1c reductions at Week 24 (LOCF) of –0.37% and –0.33% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg 
and 10 mg groups, respectively.  Subject numbers were relatively small (n=32 to 40 per treatment 
group, 107 total), and 95% CI crossed zero in both dapagliflozin treatment groups. Consistent findings 
were observed in the 9-study Pooled Monotherapy/Combination Therapy group; placebo-corrected 
adjusted mean HbA1c reductions were -0.27%, -0.30%, and -0.33% in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 
and 10 mg groups, respectively, and 95% CI excluded zero for the three treatment groups (n= 64 to 
92 per treatment group, 316 total). 
No HbA1c reductions were seen after correcting for placebo in the eGFR ≥30-<45 mL/min/1.73m2 
subgroup analysis in MB102029.  Placebo-corrected adjusted mean HbA1c changes in the ≥30 to <45 
subgroup were 0.05% and 0.07% in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively (n=33 to 45 per 
treatment group, 119 total). No corresponding analysis was performed for the Pooled 
Monotherapy/Combination Therapy group because of insufficient subject numbers. 
These results suggest that efficacy persists, although more modestly, at eGFR values ≥45 
mL/min/1.73 m2.  There is no evidence for efficacy at eGFR values below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
The efficacy of dapagliflozin decreased with decreasing GFR. Very modest effects were observed on 
HbA1c in the ITT analysis. In the subgroup analysis borderline decreases in HbA1c was observed in 
patients with GFR > 45. No placebo-corrected HbA1c decrease was observed in patients with GFR<45. 
The results of study MB102029 question the usefulness of dapagliflozin in patients with moderate renal 
impairment. 
Study D1690C00018 
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, age-stratified, placebo-controlled Phase III study 
with a 24-week short-term treatment period followed by a 28-week extension period to evaluate the 
effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily (qd) in combination with pre-existing anti-hyperglycaemic 
treatment on HbA1c and on the proportion of subjects who achieved a clinical benefit in male subjects 
≥45 years of age and female subjects ≥50 years of age with T2DM and CVD who have inadequate 
glycaemic control on monotherapy or dual combination therapy with oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), 
insulin therapy in combination with OADs, or insulin monotherapy.

In total 922 patients were randomized. Around 88% of the randomized subjects completed the 24-
week short-term treatment period and around 86% continued into the 28-week extension period. 
Primary reason for not continuing into the 28-week extension period was occurrence of a 
discontinuation criterion (44 subjects). All treated subjects were included in the safety analysis set. 
The full analysis set included 914/922 subjects (526/530 subjects in age stratum <65 years and 
388/392 subjects in age stratum ≥65 years). 
In general, the treatment groups were balanced with respect to demographic and baseline 
characteristics. On average, subjects were around 63 years of age with around 42% aged ≥65 years. 
There were about 68% male and 32% female subjects in both treatment groups. Around 94% of the 
subjects were at least overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2), and almost two thirds were obese (BMI ≥30 
kg/m2). Mean duration of T2DM was 12.4 years, and around 56% of the subjects had T2DM over 10 
years. Mean HbA1c at baseline was about 8.1%.  
Around 23% of the subjects had a normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) at baseline. A 
mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥60 and <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) was observed in 58% of the subjects. In 
almost 20% of the subjects eGFR was ≥30 and <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 which corresponds to a moderate 
renal impairment, and in 1 subject each in the dapagliflozin and placebo group eGFR ranged below 30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 which corresponds to a severe renal impairment. 
Most subjects reported coronary heart disease (75.2%) or stroke/transient ischemic attack (20.7%). 
All subjects had hypertension according to the inclusion criteria. The duration of hypertension was ≥3 
years in almost 90% of the subjects and ≥10 years in 50% of the subjects. Hypertension was well 
controlled as indicated by a mean seated SBP and DBP of 133.2 mmHg and 76.9 mmHg, respectively. 
Almost 13% of the subjects had congestive heart failure. 
Primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints are summarized for all subjects in the full analysis set in

Table 30.  Summary of primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints – full analysis set 
Subjects in the dapagliflozin group showed a statistically significant mean reduction in HbA1c from 
baseline to week 24 (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) compared to placebo in all subjects of 
the full analysis set (-0.46%) and in both age strata (<65 years: -0.42%; ≥65 years: -0.53%). 
In this study the most pronounced effect on HbA1c was observed in patients > 65 years of age. In 
these patients a mean reduction of 0.53 % was observed whereas the mean decrease in patients < 65 
was 0.42 %. Reductions in both body weight and SBP were observed. The overall findings were 
consistent with those observed in previously assessed phase 3 studies.

Study D1690C00019 
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, age-stratified, placebo-controlled Phase III study 
with a 24-week short-term treatment period followed by a 28-week extension period to evaluate the 
effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily (qd) in combination with pre-existing anti-hyperglycaemic 
treatment on HbA1c and on the proportion of subjects who achieved a clinical benefit in male subjects 
≥45 years of age and female subjects ≥50 years of age with T2DM and CVD who have inadequate 
glycaemic control on monotherapy or dual combination therapy with oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), 
insulin therapy in combination with OADs, or insulin monotherapy. 
In total 964 patients were randomized. Around 90% of the randomized subjects completed the 24-
week short-term treatment period and continued into the 28-week extension period. Primary reason 
for not completing the 24-week short-term double-blind treatment period was occurrence of a 
discontinuation criterion (28 subjects). Two subjects in the dapagliflozin group and 1 subject in the 
placebo group died during the 24-week short-term treatment period. All treated subjects were included 
in the safety analysis set. The full analysis set included 962 subjects, 511 subjects in age stratum <65 
years and 451 in age stratum ≥65 years. 
In general, the treatment groups were balanced with respect to demographic and baseline 
characteristics. On average, subjects were around 64 years of age with around 47% aged ≥65 years. 
There were about 67% male and 33% female subjects in both treatment groups. Around 95% of the 
subjects were at least overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2), and more than two thirds were obese (BMI ≥30 
kg/m2). Mean duration of T2DM was 13.2 years with around 58% of the subjects have had T2DM over 
10 years. Mean HbA1c at baseline was about 8.1%. 
Around 24% of the subjects had an eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline. An eGFR between 60 and 
90 mL/min/1.73 m2 was observed in 61% of the subjects. In around 15% of the subjects eGFR was 
≥30 and <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and no subject’s eGFR in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups ranged 
below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
As qualifying CV event, most subjects reported coronary heart disease (76.5%) or stroke/transitory 
ischemic attack (TIA) (19.6%). Almost 93% of subjects had hypertension. The duration of 
hypertension was ≥3 years in almost 87% of the subjects and ≥10 years in 55.1% of the subjects. 
Hypertension was well controlled as indicated by a mean seated SBP and DBP of 134.7 mmHg and 77.8 
mmHg, respectively. Almost 16% of the subjects had cardiac heart failure (CHF).

Supportive studies 
Phase III initial combination therapy with metformin XR studies in poorly-controlled 
treatment naïve subjects (studies MB102021 and MB102034) 
Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active controlled, parallel group, Phase III trials 
(MB102021 and MB102034) were performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin 5 and 
10 mg, respectively, in combination with metformin as initial therapy as compared with dapagliflozin 
monotherapy and metformin monotherapy. Patients included were treatment naive subjects with T2DM 
with inadequate glycaemic control. Studies MB102021 and MB102034 enrolled subjects with HbA1c 
≥7.5 % and ≤12.0%. The primary objective was to compare the change from baseline in HbA1c, 
achieved with dapagliflozin plus metformin XR compared with dapagliflozin plus placebo, and compared 
with metformin XR plus placebo after 24 weeks of double-blind therapy. Study MB102034 also formally 
evaluated non-inferiority of dapagliflozin compared to metformin XR with regard to HbA1c and FPG. 
In the 24-week double-blind phase of these studies, 598 and 638 subjects, respectively, were 
randomized and took the study medication.  
In both studies, the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 (LOCF) in the 
combination group was statistically significant and clinically relevantly larger compared to either 
monotherapy. The results on the primary endpoint favouring the combination treatment were 
supported by those on the secondary glycaemic endpoints. In addition, fewer patients needed rescue 
therapy in the combination group compared to either monotherapy. The data support an additive effect 
when dapagliflozin and metformin are co-administered.  
In study MB102034, non-inferiority was formally assessed. In the monotherapy and combination 
therapy arm, 85.6% and 82.5 % of patients, respectively, received 2000 mg metformin daily, and only 
2.9% and 4.2%, respectively, received doses < 1500 mg/d suggesting that the full glucose-lowering 
potential of metformin XR was achieved in most patients. The non-inferiority of the dapagliflozin 
treatment group compared to the metformin treatment group was demonstrated for HbA1c (treatment 
difference dapagliflozin vs. Met -0.01%, 95% CI [-0.22; 0.20]). Reduction in FPG was even superior 
(treatment difference dapagliflozin vs. Met -11.6 mg/dL, 95% CI [-18.6; -4.6]). However, since 
metformin XR is not widely licensed and used in the EU and it is not clear whether the efficacy of 
metformin XR is non-inferior to that of metformin IR, a definite conclusion on non-inferior efficacy of 
dapagliflozin compared to metformin IR is not possible from this study.

demonstrated, no p-value shown), and if successful, then by testing for superiority (p-value shown) 
Body composition study (study D1690C00012) 
A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 study was 
performed to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination with metformin on body weight 
in adult subjects with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥6.5% and ≤8.5%) on 
metformin therapy alone. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg daily 
in combination with metformin compared to placebo in combination with metformin on total body 
weight after 24 weeks of oral administration of double-blind treatment. 
In the 24-week short-term treatment period, 182 subjects were randomized and received study 
medication (91 placebo + metformin and 91 dapagliflozin + metformin). The 78-week extension period 
is currently ongoing. One of the objectives of the extension period is to evaluate bone mineral density 
after 50 and 102 weeks, which is considered very important due to indications of increased fracture 
rate associated with dapagliflozin in patients with moderate renal insufficiency. No relevant changes in 
BMD were observed after 50 weeks.

Mean baseline weight was 90.91 and 92.06 kg and mean waist circumference was 104.52 and 105.55 
cm in the placebo and dapagliflozin group, respectively. Treatment with dapagliflozin as add-on 
therapy to metformin over 24 weeks was effective in reducing body weight; the mean decrease in total 
body weight from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group was statistically 
significantly larger than in the placebo group (-2.08 kg difference versus placebo; p<0.0001). 
All key secondary endpoints were statistically significant in favour of dapagliflozin treatment. Waist 
circumference and body fat mass showed mean decreases from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) in both 
the dapagliflozin and placebo groups (waist circumference -1.52 cm difference versus placebo, 
p=0.0143; body fat mass -1.48 kg difference versus placebo, p=0.0001). Approximately 30% of the 
subjects in the dapagliflozin group and 4% of the subjects in the placebo group showed a decrease in 
body weight of at least 5% at Week 24 (LOCF) (p<0.0001). In the exploratory magnetic resonance 
(MR) sub study, treatment with dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin over 24 weeks led to a 
mean reduction in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), but not in hepatic lipid content. Lean body mass was 
also reduced more in the dapagliflozin group (-1.1 kg) than in the placebo group (-0.6 kg). Since DXA 
is not able to distinguish between muscle mass/connective tissue and body water, it is not clear how 
much of the observed decrease in lean mass is due to loss in muscle mass or fluid loss. 
The study indicates that dapagliflozin has a weight reducing potential although not of the magnitude 
that would allow any claims regarding weight reduction. Considering that the majority of patients with 
T2DM are overweight and that many of the current therapies induce a weight increase, this weight 
reducing effect could be beneficial. Furthermore, the data show a decrease in body fat, providing some 
reassurance that the weight reduction is mainly due to calorie loss and not to dehydration.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is supported by a comprehensive study program consisting of 3 Phase II studies and 11 
Phase III studies. The study program is in line with the adopted EMA Guideline “Note for Guidance on 
the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the treatment of diabetes mellitus 
(CPMP/EWP/1080/00)” and is generally in line with the given CHMP Scientific Advice. The duration of 
the studies is adequate with all but one pivotal study having a double-blind period of 24 weeks. The 
duration of the active comparator study was 52 weeks. Eight of the Phase III studies also include a 
long-term follow up of 24 to 78 weeks in order to obtain additional safety and efficacy data. The clinical 
trials generally were well-designed and conducted and during the review process no concerns 
regarding GCP compliance arose. 
The efficacy of dapagliflozin has been studied in a total of 6026 patients in the Phase II/III clinical 
program. Efficacy data are available in 2000 subjects that have been exposed to the 10 mg dose and 
461 subjects were exposed to the 10 mg dose for at least 77 weeks. Overall, about 30 % of patients 
included were European, about 17% from EU countries. Many of the studies did not include any 
European patients but the active controlled study (D1690C00004) and the placebo-controlled study 
D1690C00006 included more than 50 % of patients from the EU. However, efficacy was consistent 
across races and geographical regions, thus the results from studies performed at non-European sites 
could be extrapolated to the European population. 
HbA1c was chosen as the primary endpoint in the dose-finding studies, which is in line with the 
adopted guideline “Note for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the 
treatment of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00)”. The range of doses was chosen based on the 
data from the Phase I and II studies and is considered adequate. 
The primary and secondary endpoints chosen for the Phase III program were adequate. Further to the 
evaluation of dapagliflozin on glucose metabolism, the effect of dapagliflozin on weight and blood 
pressure was investigated. 
The patients included in the studies were representative for the target population. Patients with long-
standing disease and diabetic complications such as (mild to moderate) renal impairment or CV disease 
were generally not excluded. However, experience with dapagliflozin in patients older than 75 years is 
still limited. No data are available for adolescents with T2DM but the Applicant currently does not seek 
a paediatric indication. Although drug naïve subjects were included in the monotherapy studies to 
support the restricted first line indication applied for, this is acceptable since the effect of dapagliflozin 
is not expected to be different in patients intolerant to metformin, which is the target population. 
Patients in the add-on studies were on adequate back-ground therapy and treatment failure was an 
inclusion criterion. In the add-on to TZD study, adequate measures were taken to assure that patients 
not previously treated with TZD were indeed treatment failures. The non-inferiority, active comparator 
study was adequately designed, with the vast majority of patients being treated with the target dose of 
both dapagliflozin and glipizide. Several important studies (e.g. in patients with CVD (and 
hypertension), in patients with inadequately controlled BP, dapagliflozin as add-on to sitagliptin) are 
currently ongoing. Those that will contribute to further elucidate potential safety concerns as stated in 
the RMP are listed within the Pharmacovigilance Plan of the RMP and will have to be conducted and 
their results submitted accordingly. 
The statistical methods used are well described and considered appropriate.

Overall discontinuation rate was small (13.5%), which is re-assuring. The dose selection for phase III 
(2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg) based on efficacy and safety assessments is considered appropriate.  
In several studies, patients violating HbA1c inclusion criteria were enrolled and treated. However, 
numbers were low and the efficacy analysis not affected by their inclusion. Background treatment was 
monitored in all important studies. Relevant deviations were usually observed in very small fractions of 
the study population and to a similar extent across treatment groups excluding a relevant impact on 
study results.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Both dose-finding studies showed a significant effect on HbA1c for all doses tested when compared to 
placebo. However, a clear dose-response was only observed for FPG indicating that HbA1c might not 
yet have been fully stabilised at week 12. Only moderate increases in efficacy were observed for doses 
over 10 mg and for safety reasons (increased rates of hyperphosphataemia as well as genitourinary 
infections) the applicant decided to only investigate doses of 10 mg and lower in the Phase III 
program. This is endorsed by the CHMP. 
In the phase 3 studies, efficacy of dapagliflozin appeared generally dose-dependent.  
When dapagliflozin was given as monotherapy a moderate but clinically relevant placebo-corrected 
decrease in HbA1c of 0.54-0.66 % was observed in the 5 and 10 mg treated groups, respectively, in 
study MB102013, whereas clinically relevant changes (0.67-0.84 %) was seen for all doses tested in 
study MB102032. Baseline HbA1c was essentially similar between the two studies; however, a more 
pronounced decrease in HbA1c (0.23 % vs 0.03 %) was observed in the placebo treated group in 
study MB102013 indicating that this study population may have been less compliant to the diet and 
exercise regimen before inclusion. A dose-dependent decrease in HbA1c was observed in both studies. 
Efficacy appeared similar regardless of whether dapagliflozin was taken QAM or QPM. Secondary and 
exploratory endpoints supported the primary endpoint. A dose-dependent reduction in FPG of the same 
magnitude was observed in both monotherapy studies. As expected, a more pronounced effect on 
HbA1c was observed in patients with high baseline HbA1c. Clinically relevant reductions in body weight 
of about 2.5-3 kg were observed in both studies. However, in study MB102013 a weight reduction was 
also observed in the placebo group, thus the decrease did not reach statistical significance. 
The results with regards to HbA1c were consistent across the four add-on studies. Clinically relevant 
effects on HbA1c were observed in all add-on studies with placebo-corrected HbA1c decreases in the 
order of 0.54-0.68 % for the 10 mg dose, slightly lower HbA1c changes observed for the 5 mg dose. 
The secondary endpoints supported the primary endpoint outcome. Of note, in the add-on to insulin 
study, patients in the dapagliflozin group could be kept on a stable insulin dose whereas the insulin 
dose increased somewhat over time in the placebo treated group, indicating an “insulin-saving” effect 
of dapagliflozin. A weight reducing effect was again observed in all add-on studies. In studies where 
dapagliflozin was added to metformin or SU a considerable proportion (24-28 % and 13-24 % in the 
metformin and SU studies, respectively) of patients had a weight reduction of more than 5 %.

Dapagliflozin 10 mg was shown to have non-inferior efficacy compared to glipizide (both as add-on to 
metformin) after 52 weeks of treatment in a thoroughly designed study using appropriate doses of 
glipizide. Although initially (up to week 18), glipizide produced a clearly more pronounced HbA1c 
reduction (approx. -0.8% from baseline), this effect waned rather quickly as is known for insulin 
secretagogues. Mean HbA1c reduction at week 52 was -0.52% in both treatment groups with an upper 
limit of the 95% CI of the treatment difference of 0.11, clearly below the non-inferiority margin of 
0.35% and indicating non-inferiority. Notably, a higher proportion of patients in the glipizide treated 
group reached target HbA1c than in the dapagliflozin group (27.5 % versus 16.5 % reached HbA1c 
≤6.5% at Week 52; 32 % versus 27.4 % reached HbA1c <7% at Week 52), however, drop-out due to 
lack of glycaemic control was more common in the glipizide treated group. Other benefits of 
dapagliflozin compared to glipizide were observed such as a lower hypoglycaemia incidence (3.5 vs. 
40.8%) and weight loss (-3.22 kg vs. +1.44 kg), although, some of the weight loss may be due to fluid 
loss rather than reduction in fat mass. Although the vast majority of hypoglycaemic events were 
minor, hypoglycaemia is a frequent obstacle to achieving ideal glycaemic control with insulin or insulin 
secretagogues. The total planned study duration is 4 years. A report covering the first 52-week 
extension period of this study was provided during the evaluation. The data show a maintained effect 
up to two years, both with regards to glycaemic control and body weight.  
Dapagliflozin 10 mg was also shown to have non-inferior efficacy compared to metformin XR in a 24-
week, 3-arm initial combination trial performed in patients with high baseline HbA1c (mean about 
9.1%) using appropriate doses of metformin XR. Mean HbA1c reduction was highly similar in both 
treatment groups (-1.45 and -1.44% in the dapagliflozin and metformin XR group, respectively) with 
an upper limit of the 95% CI of the treatment difference of 0.20 indicating non-inferiority. FPG 
reduction was even superior compared to metformin XR. However, since metformin XR is not widely 
licensed and used in the EU and it is not clear whether the efficacy of metformin XR is non-inferior to 
that of metformin IR, a definite conclusion on non-inferior efficacy of dapagliflozin compared to 
metformin IR is not possible from this study. Of note, dapagliflozin was also associated with a more 
pronounced weight loss (-3.33 kg) compared to metformin XR (-1.36 kg), although, some of the 
weight loss may be due to fluid loss rather than reduction in fat mass.  
Long-term data (up to 102 weeks) from the monotherapy study showed a maintained effect of 
dapagliflozin in the groups receiving the 5 and 10 mg dose, whereas the data on the 2.5 mg dose are 
less convincing. Up to 36 weeks the risk of treatment failure was lower in the 5 and 10 mg treated 
groups compared to placebo and 2.5 mg, whereas some increase in risk was observed also at the 
higher doses after this time-point. The data from the monotherapy studies, including the long-term 
extension, together with data from the active control study are deemed sufficient to support the 
restricted first-line indication applied for. 
In a pooled analysis performed across 9 phase 3 trials the effect of dapagliflozin was found to be 
independent of gender, race, ethnicity, geographical region, BMI and duration of T2DM, which is 
reassuring. Unsurprisingly, efficacy of dapagliflozin increased with increasing baseline HbA1c. This was 
expected from the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin (i.e. increasing glucose load leading to 
increasing urinary glucose excretion). A baseline HbA1c-dependent glucose-lowering effect is also 
known from other anti-hyperglycaemic agents. A decreasing effect was observed with age, which 
appears largely due to declining renal function. The effect in patients ≥ 65 years showed a HbA1c 
decrease of only about 0.4 % and in the patients ≥ 75 years the effect was even less. However, very 
few patients in this age group were included in the studies and the data need to be interpreted with 
caution. Considering the reduced efficacy in the elderly due to reduced renal function and the safety 
concerns in this population, initiation of dapagliflozin therapy in patients 75 years and older is not 
recommended.

Across the study program a decreasing effect of dapagliflozin has been observed with decreasing GFR, 
both in the subgroup analysis and in the study specifically designed to investigate the effect of 
dapagliflozin in patients with renal impairment. In the subgroup analysis the HbA1c decrease in 
patients with GFR 30-60 was only 0.39 % with the 10 mg dose, and in the renal impairment study the 
placebo-corrected treatment effect with the 10 mg dose was only 0.11 %. In this study a subgroup 
analysis was made using a cut-off of GFR 45-60 was made, showing an HbA1c decrease of 0.33 %. 
This effect could only be considered of marginal clinical relevance and, also considering safety concerns 
(see safety section) in patients with marked renal impairment, a cut-off of GFR 60 is therefore applied. 
The weight reducing effect observed in the pivotal studies was further explored in a study dedicated to 
investigate body composition changes. Data from this study showed a significant decrease in body fat, 
thus showing that the weight loss is not only due to dehydration but also to loss of calories. A decrease 
in blood pressure was consistently observed in the Phase III studies. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical program supports the efficacy of dapagliflozin in lowering HbA1c. The effect size with the 
selected dose of 10 mg is considered clinically relevant and was consistent in all studies. The 10 mg 
dose was more efficacious than the 5 mg dose, supporting the dose recommendation proposed by the 
Applicant. In addition to the glucose lowering effect, a relevant weight reduction and a slight reduction 
of blood pressure was observed across the study program. These effects are considered beneficial. 
Both the restricted monotherapy indication and the add-on indications are considered approvable from 
an efficacy point of view.  
The efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with moderate renal impairment is debatable due to the 
decrease in efficacy observed with declining GFR. Further to this, data indicate a decreased effect in 
elderly patients, which appears mainly due to the decrease in renal function with age. Due to the small 
effect size and safety concerns, dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with a GFR < 60 
mL/min/1.73m2. 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean increase in dapagliflozin exposure was 67% and 
therefore, a lower starting dose of 5 mg is recommended. If well tolerated, the dose may be increased 
to 10 mg. This is the only recommended use for the 5 mg strength. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The primary assessment of safety in subjects with T2DM was based on 3 Phase IIb and 11 Phase III, 
double-blind, placebo/active-controlled, randomized clinical studies: 
• Monotherapy in 4 studies. 
• Add-on combination therapy with a wide variety of other antidiabetic medication in 6 studies. 
• Initial combination therapy with metformin in 2 studies. 
• A direct comparison with SU. 
• Monotherapy in subjects with moderate renal impairment 
Supportive safety information was provided from 26 clinical pharmacology studies.

The short-term (ST) treatment period was 12 weeks for the Phase IIb studies and 24 weeks for all of 
the Phase III studies, except one study with a 52-week short-term period (direct comparison to SU). 
Eight of the Phase 3 studies included long-term (LT) treatment periods ranging from 24 to 156 weeks.  
Data were pooled into 4 main datasets for analyses (Placebo-controlled Pool, Monotherapy Pool, 
Dapagliflozin plus Metformin Pool and All Phase IIb and III Studies Pool). The Placebo-controlled pool 
represented the best controlled pool available for assessment of safety. 
Clinical exposure to dapagliflozin 2.5 mg or higher, ST+LT treatment period for these 4 pools is shown 
in the table below.

In addition to the 4 main pools, the safety of dapagliflozin in other populations with other antidiabetic 
compounds (add-on to either SU, insulin, or TZD, initial combination with metformin, direct comparison 
to SU, and diabetic subjects with moderate renal impairment) was evaluated. 
Overall, there were 2.2 times more subjects exposed to dapagliflozin (n = 4287) compared with 
control (n = 1941).  2000 subjects were exposed to the 10 mg dose in the Phase IIb and III clinical 
program and 461 subjects were exposed to the 10 mg dose for at least 77 weeks.  
Exposure by age: Mean exposure during short-term treatment was similar in subjects < 65 years and 
≥ 65 years across the dapagliflozin groups. 67 subjects ≥ 75 years were exposed to dapagliflozin. 
Exposure by renal function: Patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m2) were 
excluded from the studies. A total of 684 subjects had moderate renal impairment at baseline (eGFR 
≥30 to<60 mL/min/ 1.73 m2) in the Phase IIb and III program. 
Adverse events  
The most common AEs in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group in descending order of frequency were 
nasopharyngitis, back pain, headache, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract 
infection, dyslipidemia, nausea, hypertension, influenza, pollakiuria, and dysuria. 
Adverse drug reactions (see table below) were identified based on the criteria; reported in ≥ 2% of 
subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg groups (regardless of investigator assessment of causality), 
and reported ≥ 1% more frequently in the dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg groups compared with placebo, 
and reported in 3 subjects more in the dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg groups compared with placebo.

Additional AEs considered by the investigator to be at least possibly drug-related and reported in ≥ 
0.2% of subjects and ≥ 0.1% more and ≥ 3 more subjects treated with dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg 
compared with placebo include (all occurring with uncommon frequency): thirst, constipation, blood 
creatinine increased, hyperhidrosis, vulvovaginal pruritus, blood urea increased, nocturia, weight 
decreased, dry mouth, glomerular filtration rate decreased, microalbuminuria. 
Cardiovascular (CV) safety  
The assessment of CV safety was based on a meta-analysis of independently confirmed, blindly 
adjudicated, CV events among Phase IIb and III studies (cut-off date: June 2010). Subjects with a 
wide range of duration of T2DM were included and 20% had a T2DM duration >10 years.  
The meta-analysis did not show an increased CV risk for dapagliflozin treated patients. The estimated 
hazard ratio for the primary composite endpoint (time to first event of the following adjudicated 
events: CV death, MI, stroke, and hospitalization for unstable angina) using a Cox proportional hazards 
method was 0.674 (95% CI: 0.421, 1.078). The distribution of the type of events contributing to 
primary composite endpoint was similar in both treatment groups. MI was the most common event, 
and this is where the greatest reduction in event rate was observed in the dapagliflozin pool versus 
comparator pool (4.1 versus 9.7 subjects with events/1000 subject years). The estimated hazard ratio 
for the secondary composite endpoint (time to first event including events of the primary composite 
endpoint plus unplanned coronary revascularization and hospitalization for heart failure) was 0.632 
(95% CI: 0.416, 0.959).  
During the evaluation, the Applicant submitted an updated CV meta-analysis including safety data up 
to 15th July 2011. Of the 19 studies contributing to the updated analysis, 14 were completed: 
MB102008, MB102009, D1692C00005, MB102014, MB102021, MB102029, MB102030, MB102032, 
MB102034, MB102035, D1690C00005, D1690C00006, MB102013 and MB102045. Five studies 
completed their short-term periods, and were unblinded to the Sponsor (sites, investigators and 
subjects remained blinded), but their long-term periods were ongoing: D1690C00004 (104 week ST + 
LT completed), D1690C00010 and D1690C00012 (50 week ST + LT completed), D1690C00018 and 
D1690C00019. Studies MB102035, D1690C00010, D1690C00018 and D1690C00019 are new to the 
update of the CV events meta-analysis. 
Studies D1690C00018 and D1690C00019 are randomized, double-blind, age-stratified, placebo-
controlled Phase 3 studies with a 24-week short-term treatment period followed by a 80-week 
extension period to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination with pre-existing anti-
hyperglycemic treatment on HbA1c and on the proportion of subjects who achieved a clinical benefit in 
adult subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), CV disease, and hypertension (only study 
D1690C00018) who have inadequate glycaemic control. These two studies were the largest 
contributors of added exposure to the updated meta-analysis.

For the primary composite endpoint, 145 events were included compared to 79 events in the previous 
analysis. The hazard ratio versus comparator was 0.819 (95% CI: 0.583, 1.152). Concerning the 
“harder” endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), consisting of CV death, MI and 
stroke, the hazard ratio was similar, 0.793 (95% CI: 0.537, 1.170).

Stratified Analysis. Weighted curves 
Even though the HR is somewhat higher compared to the previous analysis, the results still indicate 
that there is no signal of an increased risk of MACE associated with the use of dapagliflozin. This is an 
expected finding considering the lack of preclinical signals or reports of adverse events from the CV 
system in the phase II and III studies. However, in the pooled analysis of studies D1690C00018 and 
D1690C00019, the HR for MACE was 1.27 (95% CI 0.693-2.311), not favouring dapagliflozin, and the 
HR for the primary composite endpoint was 1.068 (95% CI 0.643-1.722).

With the responses to the 2nd Day 180 LOI, the Applicant provided detailed information on the early 
MACE events which mainly led to the imbalance of these events among treatment groups and has 
compiled the patient characteristics for all MACE cases in studies D1690C00018 and D1690C00019. 
Based on the information provided, it cannot be excluded that high CV risk patients concomitantly 
taking loop diuretics and/or antihypertensive drugs may be at increased risk for a CV events when 
starting dapagliflozin, possibly due to diuresis-induced decrease in blood pressure. However, the 
absolute number of CV events in these ongoing studies is still limited and the imbalance small and 
uncertain.  
The Applicant also provided a Kaplan-Meier curve of MACE in all patients with CV disease from the 
Phase IIb/III study pool including the new trials 18 and 19. In this evaluation no increased MACE rate, 
neither at initiation of dapagliflozin therapy nor later on could be detected in the CVD population.

Moreover, dapagliflozin administration did not cause any clinical relevant effects on the QTc interval. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia events were categorized using the following classes: 
• Major episodes of hypoglycaemia: defined as symptomatic episodes requiring external (3rd party) 
assistance with a capillary or plasma glucose value < 3 mmol/L (< 54 mg/dL) and prompt recovery 
after glucose or glucagon administration. 
• Minor episodes of hypoglycaemia: defined as either an symptomatic episode with a capillary or 
plasma glucose measurement < 3.5 mmol/L (< 63 mg/dL) regardless of the need for external 
assistance or an asymptomatic capillary or plasma glucose measurement < 3.5 mmol/L (< 63 mg/dL), 
that does not qualify as a major episode. 
• Other episodes of hypoglycaemia: suggestive of hypoglycaemia but do not meet the above criteria. 
Dapagliflozin had a low propensity for hypoglycaemia. There were no major episodes of hypoglycaemia 
when used as monotherapy. When dapagliflozin was used together with insulin and SU an increased 
risk of hypoglycaemic events was observed, mainly seen as an increase in minor hypoglycaemic 
events.  
Study D1690C00006 (add-on to insulin) contributed, with >75% of the hypoglycaemia events, to the 
Placebo-controlled Pool. The proportion of subjects with major episodes of hypoglycaemia was 0.5% in 
the placebo+insulin group and 0.5-1% in dapagliflozin plus insulin groups. Most hypoglycaemia events 
were minor and were more common in subjects treated with dapagliflozin plus insulin (42.3% - 51.5%) 
compared with placebo plus insulin (35%). 
In study D1690C00005 (add-on to glimeperide) hypoglycaemic events were reported in 6.9% to 7.3% 
of the subjects in the dapagliflozin groups and by 4.8% in the placebo group. One major episode of 
hypoglycaemia was reported in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg group (associated with diarrhoea and 
decreased oral intake).

In contrast, in study D1690C00004 (Dapagliflozin plus Metformin vs Glipizide plus Metformin - direct 
comparison to SU), the proportion of subjects with at least 1 episode of hypoglycaemia was 
substantially lower in the dapagliflozin plus metformin (3%) group compared with the glipizide plus 
metformin group (40%) (p < 0.0001).   
Genital infections 
In the Placebo-controlled Pool, the overall proportion of subjects with events suggestive of genital 
infection events was higher in dapagliflozin-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects (5.7%-
4.8% in Dapa 5 and 10 mg vs 0.9% in placebo). Events suggestive of genital infection were more 
common in females than males. The most commonly reported events in females were vulvovaginal 
mycotic infection, vaginal infection, and vulvovaginal pruritus. The most commonly reported events in 
males were balanitis, genital pruritus, and fungal genital infection. More than 97% of all events 
suggestive of genital infection were mild or moderate in intensity. Of the 286 events reported in 
dapagliflozin-treated subjects, 3 (1.0%) were severe. No events suggestive of genital infection were 
very severe and none was serious.   
Urinary tract infection (UTI) 
In the Placebo-controlled Pool (ST) the overall proportion of subjects with events suggestive of UTI was 
higher in the dapagliflozin groups than in placebo (5.7%-4.3% in dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg vs 
3.7% in placebo). Events suggestive of UTI were more common overall in females than males.    
Overall in the short-term period, kidney infections (all under the PT pyelonephritis) were reported 
rarely (0.1% in both the dapagliflozin groups and the placebo treated groups). Most events suggestive 
of UTI were mild or moderate in intensity. Four of 250 events in dapagliflozin-treated subjects and 1 of 
72 events in placebo-treated subjects were severe. Amongst the 4 severe events that occurred in the 
dapagliflozin-treated subjects, all resolved. The recurrence rate was higher in the dapagliflozin group 
than in the placebo group (18% to 21% vs 11%).   
UTI is identified as an important risk of dapagliflozin therapy and additional Pharmacovigilance 
activities are planned (clinical and epidemiological studies) in the RMP. Information is included in the 
SmPC (section 4.4 and 4.8).  
Renal impairment 
Adverse events related to renal impairment, especially increase in serum creatinine were seen in 1.2% 
of patients treated with dapagliflozin compared to 0.9 % in the placebo group with the difference being 
largest in patients with moderate renal impairment and older patients (see below, safety in special 
populations). Few AEs of renal impairment or failure were serious or led to discontinuation. The 
percentage of subjects discontinuing due to an adverse renal effect was fairly balanced between 
dapagliflozin and comparator. More patients with dapagliflozin than with comparator reached baseline 
serum creatinine after discontinuation (47.2% vs 27.9%, dapagliflozin vs. comp.) suggesting that at 
least part of the serum creatinine increase during dapagliflozin therapy was due to dehydration and not 
due to progressing renal insufficiency. Analyses of pooled and unpooled populations did not indicate 
that any medication regimen or combination (e.g. dapagliflozin monotherapy, dapagliflozin plus 
metformin, dapagliflozin add-on to insulin, etc.) was associated with evidence of renal impairment. 
Reversibility of serum creatinine increase will be followed post-marketing within the CV outcome study 
and a pharmacoepidemiological study will further assess the risk of renal impairment.

With the responses to the 2nd Day 180 LOI, the Applicant could convincingly show that virtually all 
renal effects of dapagliflozin reflect physiological adaptations that can be expected from and explained 
by the known mechanism of action (SGLT2 inhibition increasing diuresis). Data on the time course of 
eGFR (derived from serum creatinine level), show that mean serum creatinine increases and, in line 
with this, eGFR decreases after initiation of dapagliflozin treatment. However, after a few months, the 
baseline level is regularly reached again. This also indicates that serum creatinine increase may not be 
misinterpreted as renal damage. Thus, the effects of dapagliflozin on the kidney are well predictable 
and constant so that the suggested monitoring intervals of renal function are accepted (usually once a 
year, 2-4 times per year in patients approaching the limit of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). It should be noted 
that dapagliflozin was also studied in patients with moderate renal insufficiency, and no unacceptable 
hazard was identified in this population, at least for short-term use. Therefore, it is not considered 
problematic if a patient receives dapagliflozin for a limited period of time (i.e. until the next screening 
visit) while having an eGFR of below 60. In other words, setting the cut-off at 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 
includes a reasonable safety margin. 
Volume depletion 
Reactions related to volume depletion (including, but not limited to, reports of dehydration, 
hypovolaemia or hypotension) were reported in 0.8% and 0.4% of subjects who received 
dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. Hypotension was the most common event and there 
were no events of dehydration or hypovolaemia. 
Hypotension was more common in the dapagliflozin groups compared with the placebo groups for 
elderly subjects, moderate renal impairment and in patients treated with loop diuretics. In subjects 
receiving loop diuretics (n=126) the incidences of volume depletion were 9.7% and 1.8%, respectively. 
The use of dapagliflozin is not recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment, who are 
volume depleted or taking loop diuretics. 
Bone metabolism  
In the dapagliflozin clinical program, the effect of treatment with dapagliflozin on bone metabolism was 
evaluated using a combination of monitoring of electrolytes and hormones involved in bone 
metabolism, as well as monitoring of biomarkers of bone metabolism.  
No clinically important changes were observed for mean serum concentrations of calcium or urine 
calcium. However, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate was not studied extensively in patients 
although this was a prominent effect in animals and may have contributed to the increased fracture 
rate observed with dapagliflozin use in renally impaired patients (particularly with eGFR < 45 
ml/min/1.73 m2). A slightly greater mean increase in serum phosphorus from baseline was observed in 
the dapagliflozin groups in the short-term double-blind period, particularly in the 5 and 10 mg groups. 
There were small increases from baseline in mean serum phosphorous levels to Week 24 that 
remained relatively unchanged at Week 102 in all treatment groups. Urinary calcium excretion was 
highly variable and, overall, did not appear to increase with dapagliflozin use. Mean PTH levels 
increased slightly in the dapagliflozin groups (with no dose-dependent effect) compared with placebo 
with PTH increases being larger in patients with already elevated baseline PTH plasma concentrations. 
Overall, mean change from baseline in bone resorption markers (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type 
I collagen and N-terminal telopeptides of type-I collagen, and urinary deoxypyridinoline) showed a 
numerically higher increase in dapagliflozin-treated groups compared with placebo. This trend did not 
appear to be dose-related. Mean changes in serum markers of bone formation (osteocalcin and P1NP) 
were inconsistent in dapagliflozin-treated subjects. 
In the Placebo-controlled Pool (ST and ST+LT) and in the All Phase IIb and III Pool (ST+LT) there was 
no imbalance in fractures between dapagliflozin and comparator groups (≤1.6%). However in study 
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 127/170 
 
 
MB102029 (diabetic subjects with moderate renal impairment), AEs of fracture were reported in a 
higher proportion of dapagliflozin-treated subjects (4 [4.8%] and 8 [9.4%] in the 5 and 10 mg groups, 
respectively) compared with placebo-treated subjects (0%). Most of the events, eight, occurred in 
patients with eGFR<45 ml/min/1.73m2. The 4 remaining events in patients with eGFR > 45 
ml/min/1.73m2 were considered to be due to baseline characteristics imbalance, history of 
hypotension, syncope and increased risk of fracture. 
The CHMP raised the concern that dapagliflozin might lead to bone loss based on the observation of 
increased fracture incidence in the dapagliflozin group of study MB102029, conducted in renally 
impaired patients.  
An apparently dose-dependent increase in serum PTH was indeed observed after 52 weeks in the 
moderate renal impairment study MB102029. This is further addressed in the renal impairment 
section. 
The Applicant also provided data on bone parameters demonstrating that dapagliflozin does not impair 
bone quality/bone mineral density in general. For study D1690C00012, no relevant changes in BMD 
(measured by DXA) of clinical relevance relative to baseline were observed after one year.  
In conclusion there is no clear evidence that dapagliflozin induces bone demineralisation or increases 
fracture rate in a diabetic population with normal or mildly impaired renal function. However, 
dapagliflozin-related bone damage with long-term treatment cannot be fully excluded, which would be 
particularly relevant in patients with pre-existing or at risk of osteoporosis such as patients with 
relevant renal insufficiency. A potential mechanism could be the exaggerated serum PTH increase due 
to dapagliflozin-induced calcium loss. Thus, together with the fact that the efficacy of dapagliflozin 
sharply decreases under conditions of moderate renal impairment (eGFR<60), treatment with 
dapagliflozin is not be recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment. In addition, fracture 
rates will be assessed as part of the CV outcome study and two-year data on BMD assessments 
performed as part of ongoing study D1690C00012 will be provided. 
Urinary lythiasis 
An increase in urinary uric acid has been observed in phase I studies but a lower proportion of subjects 
treated with dapagliflozin compared with comparator (0.6% vs 1.2%) reported events of urinary 
lythiasis.  
Hepatic disorders  
In the Placebo-controlled Pool (ST) the proportion of subjects with elevated liver function tests was 
similar (overall and for different cut-offs) in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups (3.5-3.9% vs 4.0). 
Similar proportions of subjects in each treatment group (0.9% - 1.1% in the dapagliflozin groups; 
0.9% in the placebo group) had AEs of hepatic disorder. There was, however, one case of possible 
drug-induced liver injury (study D1690C00004) with positive dechallenge. Although, liver biopsy in this 
patient revealed signs of autoimmune hepatitis, no auto-antibodies were detected that would support 
this diagnosis. Normalisation of liver function tests finally occurred under prednisolone therapy.  
Drug-induced liver injury is addressed as a potential risk in the RMP

Haematology 
Compared to placebo, small increases from baseline were observed in haematocrit, haemoglobin, red 
blood cells, and decreases were observed in platelets. At Week 24, the mean changes from baseline in 
haematocrit were 2.15% in the group treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg versus -0.40% in the placebo 
group. Haematocrit values > 55% were reported in 1.3% of the subjects treated with 
dapagliflozin 10 mg versus 0.3% of placebo subjects.  
These hematologic changes either normalized or trended toward normalization after dapagliflozin 
discontinuation.  
There was an initial imbalance in the incidence of venous thromboembolic events not favouring 
dapagliflozin but the absolute number of events was low. An updated analysis with a data cut-off 15 
July 2011 that includes all patients exposed to dapagliflozin and comparator in Phase IIb and Phase III 
studies, provided with the responses to the 2nd Day 180 LOI, showed that a similar proportion of 
patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group (0.3 %) and the comparator group (0.3 %) had venous 
thromboembolic events (short term plus long term treatment period; in total, 5501 patients in the 
dapagliflozin group and 3184 patients in the comparator group were evaluated). Clinical consequences 
of increased haematocrit are addressed in the SmPC and as a potential concern in the RMP. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The frequency of SAEs was similar in the pooled dapagliflozin vs. the placebo groups and also vs. the 
all-comparator groups. Mortality was similar in the pooled dapagliflozin versus the all-comparator 
groups but was initially somewhat increased versus the placebo-group. A later interim analysis of two 
studies submitted during the evaluation (studies D1690C00018 and D1690C00019), performed in 
patients with CV background disease, revealed a slight imbalance in MACE events not favouring 
dapagliflozin. The significance of these findings, possible explanations (and further analyses regarding 
CV events are presented and discussed in more details above (under “CV safety”). 
Neoplasm related adverse events 
Overall tumour incidence 
In the Phase IIb/III study pool submitted in the initial marketing authorisation application, there was 
an imbalance in tumour AEs (all organ systems) between dapagliflozin and controls based on the SMQ 
of malignant or unspecified tumours (1.4% versus 1.0%).   With the responses to the D120 LOQ, the 
Applicant provided updated safety data from the 12th of May 2011 cut-off date (11 months later than in 
the original submission). In this updated study pool there was no difference in the overall incidence 
rate of tumours between dapagliflozin and all controls (1.43% versus 1.30%, see table 36). This was 
confirmed in yet another update of the study data pool with a new 15th of July 2011 cut-off date 
(incidence rate: 1.47% for the dapagliflozin versus 1.35% for the placebo/comparator group).

Incidence of tumours in specific organ systems 
If one considers a longer treatment exposure (see table 35 above) no difference was observed 
between the overall proportion of subjects with malignant or unspecified tumours being 1.47% for the 
dapagliflozin and 1.35% for the placebo/comparator group. The incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs for 
malignant/unspecified tumours of all organ systems (with the 15th of July 2011 as new cut-off date) 
are provided graphically below. The outcome is in line with random fluctuation of the incidence rate of 
individual tumour types around unity, showing higher numbers of breast cancer, bladder cancer and 
prostate cancer, and lower of renal and female reproductive tract, blood and lymphatic cancer, with 
the remaing types of malignancies being essentially similar. Although the overall figures and the 
distribution of incidences per tumor type do not suggest an increased risk, it is worth to consider more 
in detail those types of cancer that present an increased frequency.

system. Tumour incidence (malignant or unspecified neoplasms) from SMQ. 
Short-term plus long-term treatment period including data after rescue. Phase 
IIb and III pool. 15 July 2011 integrated safety database 
Breast cancer 
In the initial and the updated (12th of May 2011) safety data pool the incidence of breast cancer was 
0.37 versus 0.09% for dapagliflozin and comparators, respectively. At the 15th of July 2011 cut-off 
date, the difference was less pronounced with 0.40 versus. 0.22 cases of breast cancer per 100 patient 
years reported for dapagliflozin and comparators, respectively., 
Considering the expected incidence based on epidemiological literature data, the incidence of breast 
cancer is around 0.25 per 100 patient years in the relevant age group but the incidence in diabetic 
patients may be somewhat higher. The remarkably low incidence initially observed in the comparator 
group (0.09 versus 0.37 in the dapagliflozin group) is most likely a chance finding   
All breast tumours reported in the clinical studies were diagnosed within 48 weeks after inclusion of the 
patients in the trials. Thus, patients were exposed to dapagliflozin for less than one year to diagnosis; 
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 131/170 
 
 
 
this time frame is short in terms of tumour development and it is therefore likely that the tumours 
were pre-existing.  
Histology of the tumours in the study population did not reveal special features but were of the same 
types as found in the general population, which is in line with the assumption of pre-existence of these 
neoplasms. Further, direct or indirect hormonal action of dapagliflozin as a mechanistic basis for breast 
cancer induction is unlikely. If so, alterations in other hormone-dependent organs (uterus, ovaries) 
would have been obvious in human and/or animal studies, which was not the case. Taken together, a 
causal relationship between dapagliflozin and breast cancer is unlikely.  
Bladder cancer 
At the 15th of July 2011 cut-off date, the incidences of bladder cancer were 0.16 versus 0.03 cases per 
100 patient years in the dapagliflozin and the comparator group, respectively. After adjusting the 
analysis to take into account only those events that had been exposed for one year or longer (a more 
plausible latency for development of malignancies), there was an imbanlance with 4 cases (0.07%) in 
the dapagliflozin and no case in the placebo/comparator group. 
The incidence observed in the pooled dapagliflozin group is above expectation (the incidence of bladder 
cancer is below 0.1 per 100 patients years), but not statistically significant compared to comparators. 
The increase in cumulative bladder cancer incidence over time is virtually the same as for 
malignant/unspecified tumours in total (i.e. steady increase over two years and only few new cases 
later). As most of the bladder tumour patients had a history of (micro)-haematuria, the bladder 
tumours diagnosed during the trials may have been already present when the patients were recruited 
for the trials but were too small to be detected.  
Potential and established risk factors (age, male gender, smoking status) were well balanced between 
the dapagliflozin and the comparator group. 
There was also a concern that a mechanistic basis could exist for bladder cancer, in particular repeated 
urinary tract infections (UTIs) and increased glucose concentrations in urine due to dapagliflozin 
treatment. Data from published literature give no support that UTIs are a relevant risk factor for 
bladder cancer except in patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters. The potential role of the 
dapagliflozin induced glucosuria in growth promotion of bladder cancer remains unclear, but lacks 
scientific support. Thus, the observed difference in the incidence of bladder cancer may well be 
explained by random variation or detection bias due to an increased frequency of urogenital adverse 
reactions with dapagliflozin. 
Prostate cancer 
At the 15th of July 2011 cut-off date, the incidences for prostate cancer in the dapagliflozin and in the 
comparator group were 0.34 versus 0.16 cases per 100 patient years. After adjusting the analysis to 
take into account only those events that had been exposed for one year or longer (a more plausible 
latency for development of malignancies), there was 1 case (0.034%) with dapagliflozin and 1 case 
(0.055%) with placebo/comparator. 
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 132/170 
 
 
 
Thus, almost all patients were exposed to dapagliflozin for less than one year to diagnosis; this time 
frame is short in terms of tumour development and it is therefore likely that the tumours were pre-
existing. A specific underlying mechanism, in particular direct or indirect androgenic effects of 
dapagliflozin are unlikely because - as discussed for breast cancer - these hormonal actions most likely 
would have manifested themselves also otherwise.  
Thyroid cancer 
In the data presented with the first cut-off date, there was an imbalance in thyroid neoplasms reported 
as nodules (7 cases for dapagliflozin versus 1 for comparators). At the 15th of July 2011 cut-off date, 
the incidence was well balanced. Thus, the original signal was most likely due to random fluctuation. 
Hormone analyses 
Analyses of aldosterone, C-peptide and erythropoietin levels have been further analysed by the 
Applicant since these hormones have been suggested to have a tumour promoting effect. The data 
provided show that patients on dapagliflozin had minor increases in aldosterone and erythropoietin 
levels whereas the C-peptide levels decreased. Thus a tumour promoting effect of dapagliflozin by 
activation of these hormones appears unlikely. 
Relevant non-clinical data 
The carcinogenic potential of dapagliflozin was also investigated in non-clinical standard carcinogenicity 
studies. Furthermore, non-clinical data may reveal indications whether primary or secondary 
pharmacodynamic effects of dapagliflozin may impact tumour development. The Safety Working Party 
(SWP) of the CHMP was consulted to give advice to these aspects. SWP identified no shortcomings in 
the non-clinical carcinogenicity studies and concluded that these studies revealed no evidences of a 
carcinogenic action of dapagliflozin. Regarding potential pharmacodynamic effects, it was concluded 
that dapagliflozin is able to activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system but that this activation 
does not lead to a concern since established diuretics, e.g. hydrochlorothiazide have the same effect 
(probably even more pronounced) and do not lead to increased tumour rate. SWP stated that it cannot 
be decided whether or not glucosuria may affect the proliferation of pre-existing bladder tumours. 
However, the scientific support for this mechanism is weak. 
Deaths 
There was no imbalance in mortality between dapagliflozin and combined comparators in the All Phase 
IIb/III study pool, i.e. mortality was 0.5% in both the dapagliflozin and in the comparator group of this 
pool. However, mortality was increased by around factor 3 in the dapagliflozin group when compared 
to placebo, see table below. However, the absolute numbers were small.

Laboratory findings 
Changes from baseline in parameters related to renal function, serum phosphorus, serum calcium, 
hepatic function and haematology are described above. 
Concerning serum electrolytes, in the overall study population increased serum sodium (>150 mEq/L) 
was reported in 1.4 % of patients on dapagliflozin compared to 0.7 % in controls. In the age group > 
65 the corresponding reporting was 2.0 % in the dapagliflozin compared to 0.6 % for placebo. 
There was no evidence for increased risk of acidosis with dapagliflozin (due to induced catabolism), 
which could be of concern with concomitant metformin therapy. 
There was a small increase in LDL-C and total cholesterol after 24 weeks with a further increase after 
102 weeks which was higher in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group. There was also an 
increase in HDL-C and no difference between the groups was seen in the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio up to 102 
weeks. 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly subjects  
Treatment with dapagliflozin in subjects ≥ 65 years of age was associated with a higher proportion of 
events of renal impairment/failure (2.5% vs 1.1%, with no apparent dose-dependency). The difference 
was driven by AEs of blood creatinine increase. An overall slight increase in events considered related 
to hypovolaemia (primarily events of hypotension) was also observed in this age group. There is only 
limited data for patients ≥75 year (67 dapagliflozin treated subjects in the ST placebo-controlled pool) 
and the safety of this group was not evaluated separately. 
Therefore the CHMP requested further analysis in elderly patients > 65 years particularly prone to 
adverse reactions with dapagliflozin treatment such as volume depletion, hematocrit increase and 
potential serious sequelae due to frequent concomitant diseases (e.g. cerebro- and cardio-vascular 
disease) and medication (i.e. diuretics) and a physiologically decreased sense of thirst. 
The Applicant provided during the evaluation a thorough analysis of the elderly subjects enrolled in the 
studies. More than 1300 elderly patients were included in the studies and in the consecutive safety 
analysis so that the data base is considered large enough for reliable conclusions. Placebo controlled 
pooled data include 776 dapagliflozin treated patients >65 years and 245 placebo treated patients. 
Only 97 patients (20 placebo and 77 dapagliflozin treated) above the age of 75 were included in this 
group. In addition, data from 314 patients included in comparator trials was analysed. As expected, 
the older age group included a higher proportion of patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, 
this being most prominent in the age group > 75 years of age.  
The overall reporting of AEs and SAEs was not markedly different in the older patients as compared to 
the overall population. Data were also stratified according to co-treatment but thereby the number of 
patients per group grew rather small so that conclusions are limited. In most categories there was no 
meaningful difference between dapagliflozin and placebo treatment. No change in the reporting pattern 
was observed in the long-term follow-up when older patients were compared to the overall population. 
No alarming imbalances with regards to SAEs including deaths, were observed although somewhat 
higher rates of SAEs and deaths were observed compared to the overall population.

EMA/689976/2012

Overall the reporting rate of hypovolemia associated AEs was rather low (about 2-3 %). Rates were 
generally higher in the dapagliflozin treated group compared to placebo. There is no apparent dose 
related reporting. The concomitant use of loop diuretics was associated with a higher reporting rate. In 
the long term-follow up in the study recruiting patients with moderate renal impairment, a rather 
marked difference was observed between dapagliflozin and placebo treated patients (8 vs 2 %). This 
did not differ from the overall population in this study but supports that this is a vulnerable population. 
In the study comparing dapagliflozin and glipizide, no marked difference was observed between 
treatment groups. When analysing hypovolemia associated events by concomitant medication, again 
loop diuretics were associated with a higher risk.  
A moderate mean increase in hematocrit was observed during treatment: This was also seen in the 
total study population (i.e. not only in elderly). However, it is conceivable that elderly patients, often 
with co-morbidities, tolerate hematocrit increase less well than younger diabetics. Thus, increased 
hematocrit (or dehydration in general) may pose a particular risk for elderly patients. In patients with 
any degree of renal impairment, a markedly increased hematocrit > 55% or Na+ > 150 mEq/L was 
observed in 2 or 11 patients (out of 502), respectively, whereas no such case occurred in the placebo 
group (N=221) or in elderly patients with normal renal function, albeit the number of patients in the 
latter group was rather small (placebo, n=51; dapagliflozin, n=116). Use of dapagliflozin is not 
recommended for patients at risk of volume depletion/electrolyte imbalances.  
Hypoglycaemia events were rare in the pooled analysis and were less common in the dapagliflozin 
treated group compared to glipizide. No differences were observed when compared to the overall 
population. Notably, hypoglycaemia was lower in the dapagliflozin treated patients with moderate renal 
impairment compared to placebo. 
No imbalances compared to placebo rate or when compared to younger patients were observed with 
regards to fractures, UTI and CV risk. 
Renal function appears to be more important for determining dapagliflozin’s safety and efficacy than 
the chronological age per se. It does not appear necessary to exclude patients aged 65 or above from 
dapagliflozin treatment as long as they have an appropriate renal function. However, it is considered 
advisable to not to recommend the use in very elderly (aged 75 or above) because for these patients 
the data base is very small (only a few percent of the total study population) and renal function more 
likely to be impaired. Furthermore, elderly patients at increased risk of water/electrolyte imbalances 
due to concomitant medications or co-morbidities are expected to be at an increased risk of 
hypotension and falls and possibly also thrombosis due to increased hematocrit. Therefore treatment 
with dapagliflozin in elderly patients 75 years and above is not recommended due to the lack of data 
and since these patients are at high risk of volume depletion/electrolyte imbalances. 
Gender 
Events suggestive of genital infection and UTI were reported for a greater proportion of females than 
males in all treatment groups.

Renal impairment 
In patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 to <90 ml/min/1.73m2) the safety profile was 
consistent with the overall population.  
There were 684 subjects (11%) with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to <60 ml/min/ 1.73m2) 
included in the program, 252 of these subjects were included in the dedicated study MB102029. In this 
study patients had generally lower eGFR values than in the remaining studies and more fractures were 
reported for subjects receiving dapagliflozin compared to placebo, particularly in patients with the 
lowest eGFR values (see section “fractures” above). There were mean increases in the concentrations 
of serum phosphorus and magnesium in subjects receiving dapagliflozin, with mean values remaining 
within the normal ranges for these analytes. The mean concentration of serum PTH, which exceeded 
the upper limit of normal at baseline in all treatment groups, increased more in subjects treated with 
dapagliflozin than with placebo. AE reports in the hypotension/ dehydration/hypovolemia category, 
consisting mainly of reports of hypotension, were more frequent in the dapagliflozin groups than in the 
placebo group. 
In a subgroup analysis of patients with eGFR ≥45 to <60 ml/min/1.73m2, initially proposed by the 
applicant to be appropriate for treatment with dapagliflozin, increase in blood creatinine (5.2 % vs 0 
%), phosphorus (5.2 % vs 2.9 %), PTH (mean increase 5.5 pg/mL vs 2.6 pg/mL) and volume 
depletion (3.0%, 2.3%, and 4.7% of subjects in the dapagliflozin 2.5, 5, and 10 mg groups, 
respectively, and 1.4% in the placebo group) was more evident than in the placebo-controlled pool. 
Due to limited efficacy and potentially increased safety issues, the use of dapagliflozin is not 
recommended in this patient group.  
Patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m2) were excluded throughout the study 
program due to expected lack of efficacy.  
Severe hepatic impairment 
A phase I study (MB102027) was designed to evaluate the effects of hepatic impairment on the single 
dose PK of dapagliflozin 10 mg in non diabetic subjects with Child-Pugh Class A, B, and C hepatic 
impairment. Exposure (AUC) to dapagliflozin increased about 70% in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment. A reduced starting dose of 5 mg dapagliflozin is recommended in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Heart failure 
Patients with heart failure NYHA class III and IV were excluded from the phase III studies. Use in these 
patients is addressed as missing/limited information in the RMP. There are two Phase IIIb studies 
ongoing (D1690C00018 and D1690C00019), which include patients with NYHA class III.  
Safety based on thiazide diuretic or ACE-I and/or ARB use 
In dapagliflozin-treated subjects with thiazide diuretic use and ACE-I and/or ARB use, marketed 
laboratory abnormality for high serum potassium (≥ 6 mEQ/L) was seen more frequently.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
Dapagliflozin has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women. Due to preclinical renal findings 
dapagliflozin should not be used during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interaction studies in healthy volunteers suggest that the PK of dapagliflozin was not altered for the 
most commonly used concomitant medications in T2DM patients. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Placebo-controlled pool (ST) similar proportions of subjects across the treatment groups (2.5% 
in the placebo group vs 2.2 to 3.2% in the 2 doses dapagliflozin groups).  
Across all dapagliflozin treatment groups, the most commonly reported AEs leading to discontinuation 
(i.e., reported in at least 3 subjects) were blood creatinine increased (protocol driven discontinuation) 
and urinary tract infection. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database is considered sufficiently large. The most common AEs (≥ 2%) in the dapagliflozin 
10 mg group during the short-term period were (in descending order of frequency): nasopharyngitis, 
back pain, headache, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, dyslipidemia, 
nausea, hypertension, influenza, pollakiuria, and dysuria. 
There was no imbalance in mortality between dapagliflozin and combined comparators in the all Phase 
IIb/III study pool, i.e. mortality was 0.5% in both the dapagliflozin and in the overall comparator 
group of this pool.  
Overall, the frequency of SAEs was similar in the dapagliflozin and the placebo groups.  
In the Phase IIb/III study pool submitted in the initial marketing authorisation application, there was 
an imbalance in tumour AEs (all organ systems) between dapagliflozin and controls (1.4% versus 
1.0%). With the responses to the D120 LOQ, the Applicant provided updated safety data from the 12th 
of May 2011 cut-off date (11 months later than in the original submission). In this updated study pool 
(with an overall increased exposure in patient-years of 40% in the control group and 26% in the 
dapagliflozin group) there was no difference in the overall incidence rate of tumours between 
dapagliflozin and all controls (1.43 versus 1.30%). This was confirmed in yet another update of the 
study data pool with a new 15th of July 2011 cut-off date (incidence rate: 1.47% for the dapagliflozin 
and 1.35% for the placebo/comparator group). 
When considering the cases of tumours occuring in the different organ systems, the relative risk 
associated with dapagliflozin was above 1 for some tumours (bladder, prostate, breast) and below 1 
for others (e.g. blood and lymphatic, ovary, renal tract), not resulting in an overall increased tumour 
risk associated with dapagliflozin. The increased/decreased risk was not statistically significant in any 
of the organ systems. 
However, due to the numerical imbalances (15th of July 2011 cut-off date) in cases of breast cancer 
(10 cases versus 3), bladder neoplasms (PTs; bladder cancer, bladder neoplasm, bladder transitional 
cell carcinoma and bladder transitional cell carcinoma stage II) (9 cases versus 1) and prostate cancer 
(PTs; prostate cancer, prostate cancer recurrent) (10 cases versus 3), possible explanations to these 
imbalances were carefully examined during the assessment procedure.

Concerning both breast and prostate cancer, it appears likely that the vast majority of them were pre-
existing since, except for two cases of prostate cancer, all of them occurred within the first 48 weeks of 
treatment. Further, direct or indirect hormonal action of dapagliflozin as a mechanistic basis for 
breast/prostate cancer induction is unlikely. If so, alterations in other hormone-dependent organs 
(uterus, ovaries) would have been obvious in human and/or animal studies, which was not the case. 
Bladder cancer was reported in 0.16 % of dapagliflozin treated subjects (9 cases) compared to 0.03 % 
in the all control group (1 case; note that the control group was smaller than the verum group). On the 
other hand, renal tract tumours were numerically lower with dapagliflozin. Known risk factors for 
bladder cancer (age, male gender and smoking) were equally distributed among treatment groups. 
Two 24-month carcinogenicity studies performed in rats and mice with a maximum exposure of 72 to 
186 times (depending on species and sex) above the therapeutic exposure in humans, did not reveal a 
carcinogenic potential of dapagliflozin, which is reassuring. The CHMP is not aware of a case where a 
drug found to induce tumours in humans has not created a signal in long-term carcinogenicity studies. 
The potential role of the dapagliflozin induced glucosuria in growth promotion of bladder cancer 
remains unclear, but lacks scientific support. Thus, the observed difference in the incidence of bladder 
cancer may well be explained by random variation or detection bias due to an increased frequency of 
urogenital adverse reactions with dapagliflozin. 
In conclusion, with more exposure data available at the latest cut-off date, the imbalance of tumour 
events observed in the dataset provided for the initial application was no longer discernible and there 
was no difference in overall tumour incidence. Considering the lack of tumour findings in non-clinical 
studies as well as the short latency between first drug exposure and tumor diagnosis, a causal 
relationship is considered as unlikely. However, since a numerical imbalance of bladder and breast 
cancer and to some extent prostate cancer remained, and must be addressed with the utmost 
vigilance, neoplasms (i.e. bladder, breast and prostate cancer) have been included among the  
potential risks in the RMP and Pharmacovigilance activities described. It is proposed that bladder, 
breast and prostate cancer are specifically investigated as part of the planned CV outcome study. 
Considering the possible association of pioglitazone and bladder cancer, the combination of 
dapagliflozin and pioglitazone is not recommended.  
For dapagliflozin treated patients bone resorption markers, serum phosphorus and serum PTH were 
higher than in the comparator group with PTH increases being higher in patients with already elevated 
baseline PTH plasma concentrations. Follow-up (52 week) data of study MB102029 (in patient with 
moderate renal impairment) indicate a small and dose-dependent increase in serum PTH in the 
dapagliflozin groups. Moreover, an increase in fracture rate for the dapagliflozin group was observed in 
the same study, particularly in those with the most profound renal impairment (GFR<45 ml/min). On 
the other hand, the 1-year DXA results from an ongoing study did not reveal any relevant changes in 
bone mineral density associated with dapagliflozin in either patients with normal or mildly impaired 
renal function. However, dapagliflozin-related bone loss with long-term treatment cannot be fully 
excluded even with a slight increase in PTH, which would be particularly relevant in patients with pre-
existing or at risk of osteoporosis. Bone fracture is included as a potential risk in the RMP. Bone 
fractures will be further studied as part of the CV outcome study.

Regarding dapagliflozin use in elderly, in patients ≥ 65 years the difference from placebo was more 
evident for events of renal impairment and volume depletion, especially hypotension. There is only 
limited data for patients ≥75 years of age. Elderly patients are likely more prone to water/electrolyte 
imbalance due to frequent concomitant medication and baseline impaired renal function, which, 
together with a decreased sense of thirst, may increase the vulnerability for volume depletion with 
dapagliflozin use leading to haematocrit increase and potentially other sequelae including hypotension. 
After thorough review of the available data this concern remains and the initiation of dapagliflozin 
therapy is not recommended in patients > 75 years of age. Dapagliflozin should be used with caution 
in elderly patients, especially in those on concomitant diuretics. Due to diminishing effect of 
dapagliflozin with decreasing GFR and safety concerns, the B/R ratio of dapagliflozin is considered 
negative in all patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2).  
There were no major episodes of hypoglycaemia when dapagliflozin was used as monotherapy. When 
dapagliflozin was used together with insulin and SU an increased risk of hypoglycaemic events was 
observed, mainly seen as an increase in minor hypoglycaemic events. This information is reflected in 
the SmPC. 
An increased risk of UTI and genital infection was identified, which was considered a consequence of 
urinary excretion of glucose. A majority of these events were of mild or moderate intensity and 
responded well to a single course of antibiotics. Events of kidney infections were reported rarely and 
with similar frequency in dapagliflozin treated subjects and placebo. There is a possible risk of severe 
UTI and the applicant’s plan to follow this risk via a planned epidemiological study (see the RMP) is 
endorsed. The recurrence rate of UTI was higher in dapagliflozin group than in placebo. This 
information is reflected in the SmPC.  
Dapagliflozin has a diuretic effect and AEs of volume depletion (e.g hypotension) was more frequent in 
some of the safety pools. In the subgroups of subjects ≥ 65 years of age, subjects with baseline eGFR 
≥ 45 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and subjects receiving loop diuretics events were more common in 
the dapagliflozin groups compared with the placebo groups.  
Overall, there was no imbalance between dapagliflozin and comparator in events of renal impairment. 
However, in elderly and in patients with renal impairment (eGFR 45-60mL/min/m2) events of renal 
impairment or failure and creatinine increase (≥ 1.5 pre-treatment creatinine) were more frequent in 
the dapagliflozin group. Upon discontinuation of therapy, increased serum creatinine values returned 
more frequently to baseline values in patients treated with dapagliflozin than with comparator (47.2% 
vs 27.9%). This may indicate that at least part of the serum creatinine increase during dapagliflozin 
therapy was due to dehydration and not due to progressing renal insufficiency. In fact, the time course 
of eGFR (derived from serum creatinine level) which was provided by the Applicant during the 
evaluation, shows that mean serum creatinine increases and, in line with this, eGFR decreases after 
initiation of dapagliflozin treatment, probably because of dehydration. However, after a few months, 
the baseline level is regularly reached again, most likely because counter-regulatory mechanisms such 
as enhanced activity of the renin-angiotensin system come into play. This again indicated that serum 
creatinine increase may not be misinterpreted as renal damage. Thus, the effects of dapagliflozin on 
the kidney are well predictable and constant so that the suggested monitoring intervals of renal 
function are accepted (usually once a year, 2-4 times per year in patients approaching the limit of 60 
ml/min/1.73 m2). It should be noted that dapagliflozin was also studied in patients with moderate renal 
insufficiency, and no unacceptable hazard was identified in this population, at least for short-term use. 
Therefore, it is not considered problematic if a patient receives dapagliflozin for a limited period of time 
(i.e. until the next screening visit) while having an eGFR of below 60. In other words, setting the cut-
off at 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 includes a reasonable safety margin.

Across the studies, similar proportions of subjects with elevations of ALT or AST (overall and for 
different cut-offs) were observed for dapagliflozin and placebo/comparator. There was, however, one 
case of possible drug-induced liver injury. Renal failure and liver injury are included in the RMP as 
potential risks and an epidemiological study is planned to study the prevalence of serious cases post-
marketing. 
Clinical trials revealed that dapagliflozin consistently increases the haematocrit, albeit generally to a 
small degree, which could favour thrombotic and embolic events. Nevertheless, the latest analysis in 
around 8700 patients, provided in the responses to the 2nde LOI, showed that a similar proportion of 
patients in the dapagliflozin treatment group and the comparator group had venous thromboembolic 
events (0.3 % in both groups). 
An increase in urinary uric acid has been observed in phase I studies but no increased risk of urinary 
stones was found. The clinical relevance of the observed increase in uric acid excretion and subsequent 
lowering of serum uric acid levels with longer term treatment will be further investigated in the 
planned cardiovascular outcome study. 
No increased cardiovascular risk was found for dapagliflozin treated subjects in the CV meta-analysis.   
The results of the pooled analysis of study D1690C00018 and D1690C00019 in patients with high CV 
risk have been further discussed by the Applicant. The data provided suggests that high CV risk 
patients concomitantly taking loop diuretics and/or antihypertensive drugs may be at increased risk for 
a CV event when starting dapagliflozin, possibly due to a diuresis-induced decrease in blood pressure. 
However, the absolute number of CV events in these ongoing studies is still limited and the imbalance 
small and uncertain. 
Additional analysis in all patients with CV disease from the Phase IIb/III study pool including the new 
studies D1690C00018 and D1690C00019 showed no increased MACE rate, neither at initiation of 
dapagliflozin therapy nor later in the CVD population. This is reassuring since it demonstrates that the 
risk for CVD patients in general is not appreciably increased. Nevertheless, patients with more severe 
CVD as included in studies D1690C00018 and D1690C00019 may be more susceptible to the 
haemodynamic changes induced by dapagliflozin, especially with concomitant intake of 
antihypertensive medication. Since the indication of dapagliflozin is for treatment of diabetes, 
physicians and patients may not be aware of the blood pressure-lowering effect and potential safety 
issues in vulnerable patients. A warning for patients for whom a dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood 
pressure could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-
hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension has been included in the SmPC. 
A small increase in LDL-C and total cholesterol was observed after 24 weeks with a further increase 
after 102 weeks which was higher in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group. No difference 
between the groups was seen in the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio after 24 weeks (due to an increase in HDL-C).  
The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio remained unchanged up to 102 weeks. No potential mechanism for the change 
in lipids has been identified but the clinical relevance with long term treatment will be investigated 
within the planned cardiovascular outcome study. 
Events of marked serum electrolyte abnormalities were generally balanced between dapagliflozin (all 
doses) and controls, except for hypernatraemia that was reported more often in the dapagliflozin 
group. Hyperkalemia (>6 mEQ/L) was observed more frequently in dapagliflozin treated patients with 
thiazides as well as with ACE-I and/or ARB use compared with placebo. The Applicant outlined that 
changes in electrolytes and in the renin-angiotensin system are in general larger with standard 
diuretics therapy than with dapagliflozin. Thus, these changes are deemed clinically manageable and 
are therefore not considered to be of particular concern.

In the sub-group analysis of patients with eGFR ≥ 45 and < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 the increase in blood 
creatinine, phosphorus, PTH and hypotension was more evident for dapagliflozin treated subjects than 
seen in the placebo-controlled pool. Information on the more frequently observed AEs (events of renal 
impairment, phosphorus and PTH increase, hypotension) in this patient group has been added to the 
SmPC.  
Additional expert consultations 
As per CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) expert meeting for diabetes/endocrinology 
was convened on 9 January 2012 to obtain input on the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin and to 
provide advice on the list of questions adopted by the CHMP at its October 2011 meeting. The SAG 
provided the following answers to the questions raised by the Committee: 
1. 
The clinical importance of the effects seen in the studies with dapagliflozin taking 
into account the magnitude of the HbA1c reduction, the effect on body weight and 
blood pressure as well as the influence of renal function on the effect.  
The observed reduction in HbA1c, the principal outcome parameter, was of the order of 0.5-0.7%. 
Although relatively modest, this met the criteria for non-inferiority in comparison with metformin or 
sulfonylureas, and was (in the view of some experts) comparable to the effect achieved with the 
gliptins. It was however noted that the effect of dapagliflozin diminished with declining renal function, 
as commonly encountered in older people with diabetes, and was overall about 0.4% in those over 
the age of 65 as a group, although it is important to note that efficacy was retained in older people 
with normal renal function. These observations emphasised the need for careful patient selection, 
since the risk/benefit ratio could otherwise be considered borderline or unfavourable in unselected 
older patients, and recent large studies have confirmed that longer term benefit from this degree of 
improved glucose control could not reasonably be expected. The patient representative emphasized 
that from his point of view even such a moderate effect was still very welcome for those striving for 
improved control in type 2 diabetes. 
Dapagliflozin also produces small reductions in weight and blood pressure. Fluid depletion is likely to 
represent a proportion of the loss in weight, and to be responsible for the reduction in blood pressure. 
Although limited in scale, these responses nonetheless contribute to a favourable overall effect of 
treatment. The pharmacological principle represented by dapagliflozin is novel, offering the additional 
benefit that this agent can usefully be combined with other therapies with differing pharmacological 
actions. The net effect of SGLT2 inhibition is achieved by loss of glucose from the body, together with 
the fluid loss occasioned by an osmotic diuresis. The glucose loss might be considered a form of 
involuntary carbohydrate restriction, but the experts were not convinced that the catabolic effects 
associated with this were identical to those that might be anticipated from, e.g., the equivalent 
reduction in dietary intake. The pattern of reduction of lean versus fat body mass (derived from DEXA 
data) did not raise concern, but the experts considered that more data should be obtained regarding 
protein turnover, and suggested that this should be investigated further, e.g. by the use of tracer 
studies. In general, there were concerns that more needs to be known about the longer term 
metabolic consequences of use of a novel agent to which people might potentially be exposed for 
many years.

2. 
The safety profile of dapagliflozin, in particular the influence of renal function as well 
as the diuretic effect which, in some susceptible patients may result in hypotension, 
electrolyte derangements and increased haematocrit.  
The SAG focused upon the more common safety effects related to the mechanism of action of 
dapagliflozin, and did not spend much time in discussion of rarer potential off-target effects. In 
general, the unwanted consequences of glycosuria coupled with osmotic diuresis  were predictable, 
with a marked increased in genital infections, a smaller increase in urinary tract infections, and an 
increased risk of fluid depletion in those already predisposed to this for other reasons. The SAG noted 
that such unwanted effects, although classed as minor, could impact adversely upon an individual’s 
quality of life. Such effects would include genital infection and (potentially) aggravation of urinary 
urgency or incontinence. With respect to the latter point, however, it was noted that there was no 
apparent effect upon the frequency of nocturia.  Overall, the safety profile for the period of 
observation appears to be acceptable in those with normal renal function, and also in those with 
mildly reduced renal function; the diminishing benefit in the latter might however be expected to 
influence the risk/benefit balance adversely. As mentioned in response to the previous question, 
longer term consequences of a forced osmotic diuresis (for example, the increase in plasma 
phosphate and PTH) also need to be considered, and the experts would have liked to see stronger 
evidence of a commitment to longer term research monitoring. The risk posed by volume depletion 
was also of some concern, since older people have restricted renal function and reduced appreciation 
of thirst. They are therefore more likely to present late with features of fluid depletion, and in 
conditions of everyday clinical practice these might not be easily recognized and acted upon. It might 
be justified to consider specific circumstances leading to volume depletion in more detail, e.g. 
reduced fluid intake, gastrointestinal illness, severe infection leading to diarrhoea and/or vomiting, 
although the current advice to stop treatment during such episodes was considered appropriate. The 
role of renal function is considered further in the response to question 3, and appropriate restrictions 
upon its use in the answer to question 4.  
3. 
The appropriate target population (with respect to e.g. age, renal function, co-
morbidities, concomitant medications) for treatment with dapagliflozin considering 
the responses to question 1 and 2. 
The applicant has proposed the following restrictions: therapy not to be initiated in patients with GFR 
< 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, therapy not to be initiated in patients over the age of 75 and therapy not 
recommended in patients receiving loop diuretics. The applicant has investigated the effect of 
treatment in those with more advanced renal insufficiency (GFR >45, <60 ml/min/1.73 m2), and 
adverse effects were not markedly increased in this group. The higher cut-off of <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 
was therefore considered to offer an appropriate prudential margin of safety.    
The use of eGFR to define the treatment cut off came in for much discussion, since there is 
considerable imprecision in widely-used estimates such as the Cockcroft-Gault formula or the MDRD 
(Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) formula, which themselves tend to give different results. The 
“safety margin” referred to in the previous paragraph would however suggest that this degree of 
imprecision is nonetheless acceptable in clinical use. Extreme old age apart, age would not be an 
appropriate cut-off, but was noted to be correlated with deteriorating kidney function, lesser life-
expectancy, more comorbidities, and (in many circumstances) to require less aggressive glucose-
lowering therapy.  
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 142/170 
 
 
 
 
The SAG noted that, although the mode of action of this agent is unique, there are no unique clinical 
indications for its use, and therefore no specific target population in mechanistic terms. Older patients 
in general were considered less suitable because of diminishing efficacy (except in those with normal 
renal function), less likelihood of benefit in terms of glucose-responsive outcome measures, and 
overall susceptibility to adverse consequences such as infections, urinary problems and fluid 
depletion. There is a clear risk that this product might be over-used or inappropriately used in older 
individuals, but it would not seem appropriate to with-hold its potential benefits from those who have 
been appropriately screened and monitored. After extensive discussion, therefore, SAG (with some 
reluctance) felt that the agreed restrictions were appropriate. It further noted that clinical experience 
with this therapy is still very limited, and that greater clinical experience will be needed before its 
position and value within the clinical armamentarium can be established upon a sounder basis.  
4. 
The adequate monitoring of a possibly restricted target population taking into 
account that patients treated with dapagliflozin may develop impaired renal function 
and other co-morbidities as well as start new concomitant medications which may 
change the effect and safety of dapagliflozin. Would this constitute a problem in 
clinical practice? 
The SAG accepted that annual monitoring of serum creatinine is already accepted clinical practice, 
and would therefore be performed effectively. It was less convinced that more intensive monitoring, 
as suggested by the applicant, would prove practicable in clinical practice, and there are other clinical 
situations in which this has proved to be the case. The patient representative emphasized that both 
patients and doctors should accept the responsibility for monitoring therapy. The SAG proposes a 
simpler cut off, for which a precedent already exists with metformin therapy, and recommends that 
therapy should be discontinued when the threshold has been breached on a single occasion (whilst 
excluding laboratory errors and allowing resumption of therapy in individual cases with clear 
temporary cause for deterioration), instead of requiring treatment to be stopped only after further 
confirmation of the biochemical abnormality. The applicant pointed out that a transient reduction in 
eGFR is to be expected in those starting therapy, but repeat estimations are not performed routinely 
at this stage of treatment, and the effect is likely to be seen only in those with borderline eGFR who 
are anyway less likely to derive benefit. Other measures were briefly considered. Haematocrit could 
potentially be an indicator of increased risk of thromboembolic events, but a rise in haematocrit would 
most often reflect dehydration, which could be measured in other ways.  
5. 
The value of dapaglifozin as an additional tool in the treatment of patients with T2DM 
taking into account the mechanism of action, the magnitude of the effects as well as 
the potential limitations discussed in previous questions. 
The SAG agreed that there is a need for new and innovative therapies for type 2 diabetes, and the 
introduction of a novel therapeutic principle is therefore of considerable potential interest. More than 
one of the participants commented on the frustrations of attempting to achieve good control, the 
usefulness of relatively minor glycaemic benefits, and the potential advantage of another therapeutic 
option when seeking to individualize therapy. This having been said, none expressed strong 
enthusiasm for this particular approach to therapy. Several were lukewarm in support, and one 
advised against its introduction (on the grounds that it did not address the mechanisms of disease, 
represented a distortion of normal physiology, and that its place in therapy was not yet established). 
Another was concerned about the limitations inherent in monitoring renal function, the stopping rules, 
the so far not widely tested mechanism of action, and the bladder cancer issue.  
It was agreed that dapagliflozin currently has limited potential for use as monotherapy, even in those 
intolerant to metformin, and that no single patient group is likely to derive unique benefit. It will 
Forxiga 
Assessment report

Page 143/170 
 
 
 
therefore need to compete on an equal basis with a number of established second line treatment 
options. It was also agreed that longer-term metabolic consequences required further investigation, 
and that the potential role of this new agent in therapy is not as yet soundly established. 
Notwithstanding, the overall view of the SAG was that dapagliflozin has potential value as an adjunct 
to the existing therapeutic options, and that the risk/benefit ratio supported its cautious introduction 
into wider clinical use, with the exclusions described above. The SAG would like to see careful post-
marketing monitoring of its use and real-world efficacy, together with more data on the risk/benefit 
ratio in older people. Finally, the SAG commended the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur for their work 
concerning restrictions on the use of this agent, and endorsed their recommendations in all but minor 
respects.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Several of the risks of dapagliflozin are associated with its mechanism of action (glucosuria and diuretic 
effect), such as genital and urinary tract infections, hypoglycaemia, volume depletion and elevated 
haematocrit. The majority of these events were mild or moderate and manageable.  
The finding of more neoplasms in the dapagliflozin groups (i.e. bladder, breast and prostate cancer) 
was unexpected based on the results of the non-clinical development program. All breast and prostate 
cancer cases occurred early on, and no potential tumour promoting mechanism has been identified for 
either breast or prostate cancer. The potential role of the dapagliflozin induced glucosuria in growth 
promotion of bladder cancer remains unclear, but lacks scientific support. Further evaluation of this 
safety concerns is warranted post-approval (pharmacoepidemiological study and CV outcome study, as 
reflected in the RMP). 
The one case of possible drug-induced liver injury is of concern despite otherwise reassuring data on 
hepatic toxicity. Liver injury has been included as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be 
further evaluated in a pharmacoepidemiological study. 
The incidence of bone fractures was increased in patients with relevantly impaired renal function when 
treated with dapagliflozin, although the absolute numbers were low. Due to decreased efficacy in 
conjunction with the noted safety concerns, treatment of patients with moderate to severe renal 
insufficiency is not recommended. Despite an absence of an imbalance in fracture incidence and 
reassuring 1-year data on BMD in patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function, a potential 
negative effect of dapagliflozin on bone metabolism with long-term treatment cannot be ruled out in 
this population. Bone facture is included in the RMP as an important potential risk. Two-year data on 
BMD (study D1690C00012) are expected and bone fractures will be followed post-marketing as part of 
the planned CV outcome study. 
Dapagliflozin treatment results in weight reduction due to nutrient loss by glucosuria. Concerns arose 
whether the long-term catabolic effects elicited by dapagliflozin may differ from those caused by 
reduction in dietary intake, e.g. with regard to protein turnover. However, published data have been 
provided indicating that the observed effects are not qualitatively or quantitatively different to those 
observed with a reduction in dietary intake. There was no evidence for increased risk of acidosis with 
dapagliflozin, which would be of particular concern with concomitant metformin therapy.  
Forxiga 
Assessment report  
EMA/689976/2012 
Page 144/170 
 
 
Concerns also arose with regard to the potential long term consequences of the dapagliflozin-induced 
osmotic diuresis, e.g. with respect to effect on serum electrolytes. By inducing osmotic diuresis and 
weak natriuresis, dapagliflozin exerts qualitatively similar effects as thiazide diuretics. Since the latter 
are a well-established and widely prescribed substance class the potential risk and necessary 
precautions are understood by the prescribers. It has been demonstrated that dapagliflozin causes 
similar adaptive changes as hydrochlorothiazide albeit, in general to a smaller extent. Thus, the risks 
associated with dapagliflozin-induced diuresis appear manageable. 
Due to the safety profile of dapagliflozin and its decreasing efficacy with decreasing renal function, 
dapagliflozin is not recommended in very elderly (> 75 years) or in patients with moderate renal 
impairment (GFR <60) or in patients at risk of water/electrolyte imbalance. Although the safety profile 
would not pose an unacceptable risk, no indication have been granted by the CHMP as the submitted 
date are not considered sufficient to support a positive B/R in this target.  
Off-label use is included in the RMP as an important potential risk and will be studied post-marketing 
(drug utilisation study), which is considered appropriate. 
Patients at high CV risk may be more susceptible to the haemodynamic changes induced by 
dapagliflozin, especially with concomitant intake of antihypertensive medication. Since the indication of 
dapagliflozin is for treatment of diabetes, physicians and patients may not be aware of the blood 
pressure-lowering effect and potential safety issues in vulnerable patients. Therefore clear warnings 
regarding the diuretic and blood pressure-lowering effect of dapagliflozin have been included in the 
SmPC.

Caution should be exercised in 
patients for whom a 
dapagliflozin induced drop in 
blood pressure could pose a 
risk, such as patients with 
known cardiovascular disease, 
patients on anti hypertensive 
therapy with a history of

For patients receiving 
dapagliflozin, in case of 
intercurrent conditions that 
may lead to volume depletion, 
careful monitoring of volume 
status (e.g. physical 
examination, blood pressure 
measurements, laboratory tests 
including haematocrit) and 
electrolytes is recommended. 
Temporary interruption of 
treatment with dapagliflozin is 
recommended for patients who 
develop volume depletion until 
the depletion is corrected. 
Elderly patients may be at a 
greater risk for volume 
depletion and are more likely to 
be treated with diuretics. In 
subjects ≥ 65 years of age, a 
higher proportion of subjects 
treated with dapagliflozin had 
adverse reactions related to 
volume depletion.

• Prior to initiation of 
concomitant medicinal products 
that may reduce renal function 
and periodically thereafter 
• For renal function

While a causal relationship 
between dapagliflozin and 
bladder cancer is unlikely, as a 
precautionary measure, 
dapagliflozin is not 
recommended for use in 
patients concomitantly treated 
with pioglitazone. Available

pioglitazone suggest a small

During clinical trials, the overall 
proportion of subjects with 
malignant or unspecified 
tumours was similar between 
those treated with dapagliflozin 
(1.47%) and 
placebo/comparator (1.35%), 
and there was no 
carcinogenicity or mutagenicity 
signal in animal data (see 
section 5.3). When considering 
the cases of tumours occurring 
in the different organ systems, 
the relative risk associated with 
dapagliflozin was above 1 for 
some tumours (bladder, 
prostate, breast) and below 1 
for others (e.g. blood and 
lymphatic, ovary, renal tract), 
not resulting in an overall 
increased tumour risk 
associated with dapagliflozin. 
The increased/decreased risk 
was not statistically significant 
in any of the organ systems. 
Taking into account the lack of 
tumour findings in non-clinical 
studies as well as the short 
latency between first drug 
exposure and tumour diagnosis, 
a causal relationship is 
considered unlikely. Since the 
numerical imbalance of breast, 
bladder and prostate tumours 
must be considered with 
caution, it will be further 
investigated in post-

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Dapagliflozin is the first compound to inhibit SGLT2. By blocking this transporter protein, renal glucose 
reabsorption is decreased which leads to increased urinary glucose excretion and an osmotic diuresis. 
Dapagliflozin represents an entirely new concept for the treatment of T2DM.  
A dose-dependent increase in glucose excretion has been demonstrated associated with calorie loss. 
The clinical program to support the proposed indications includes 4287 patients receiving dapagliflozin 
whereof around 2000 patients have been treated with the proposed dose of 10 mg per day. Compared 
to placebo, dapagliflozin 10 mg provided statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in 
glycaemic control (placebo-corrected HbA1c decrease of 0.52-0.68 % at 24 weeks) when given as 
monotherapy or as add-on to metformin, SU (glimepiride), TZD (pioglitazone) or insulin.  
Dapagliflozin 10 mg was also shown to have non-inferior efficacy compared to glipizide (when added to 
metformin) after 52 weeks of treatment and non-inferior efficacy compared to metformin XR (both as 
monotherapy) with both comparators titrated to a sufficiently high dose to achieve full glucose-
lowering potential. Although initially glipizide produced a more pronounced HbA1c reduction (maximum 
-0.81% from baseline at week 18), this extra effect waned rather quickly as is known for insulin 
secretagogues and was virtually identical to dapagliflozin at week 52.  
The 10 mg dose was more efficacious than the 5 mg dose, supporting the dose recommendation 
proposed by the Applicant. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the mean increase in 
dapagliflozin exposure was 67% and therefore, a lower starting dose of 5 mg is recommended. If well 
tolerated, the dose may be increased to 10 mg. This is the only recommended use for the 5 mg 
strength. 
Long-term data of 48 to 102 weeks in duration indicate maintenance of the glucose-lowering effect of 
dapagliflozin. About 60 % of dapagliflozin patients completed the 102 week study periods.  
Reductions of body weight of about 2-3 kg have been observed in all studies. Approximately 20-25 % 
of subjects treated with doses of 5 to 10 mg had a weight reduction of more than 5 %. Data indicate 
that the effect is maintained for at least 102 weeks. The majority of the weight loss was shown to be 
due to decrease in body fat (-1.5 kg over 24 weeks) including visceral fat, and not to dehydration, and 
can be explained by the renal nutrient (glucose) loss. Furthermore, a slight and consistent decrease in 
blood pressure was observed across the study program.  
As the effect of dapagliflozin is dependent on the GFR, less prominent decreases in HbA1c were 
observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (0.37 % in patients with eGFR 45-60 
ml/min/1.73mg2) and essentially no improvement in glycaemic control in patients with GFR below 45 
ml/min/1.73mg2. Further to this, a decrease in effect was seen with increasing age (0.32 % in patients 
≥ 75 years), which was related to the decrease in renal function with age rather than age per se. 
Sufficient data has been provided to conclude that the monitoring of renal function as currently 
proposed in the SmPC is able to identify patients with declining renal function in an acceptable way, 
also taking into consideration that the proposed restrictions in the target population are set with a 
reasonable safety margin.

Dapagliflozin has a low hypoglycaemic potential. This was especially evident in comparison to glipizide 
(hypoglycaemia incidence 3.5 versus 40.8%), although most hypoglycaemic events were classified as 
minor.  
Dapagliflozin can be taken orally once a day and its efficacy appears independent of whether it is taken 
in the morning or in the evening, with or without food. Dapagliflozin has a favourable pharmacokinetic 
profile with low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions and moderate influence of intrinsic factors on 
dapagliflozin’s PK. Influence of age (up to 70 years), gender, fatness, mild renal impairment and mild 
and moderate hepatic impairment on dapagliflozin exposure was estimated to be on average less than 
40% and were not considered clinically relevant. 
Except for a PD interaction with diuretics, dapagliflozin appears to have low potential of interaction 
with other antihyperglycaemic agents or other medication frequently co-administered in patients with 
T2DM. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Data in patients above age 75 are limited although a pooled data analysis suggested that age is not an 
independent predictor of effect (when adjusted for renal function). However, renal function is 
frequently reduced in elderly subjects and the risk of renal impairment is even higher in patients with 
diabetes. 
By decreasing serum glucose levels through renal glucose elimination, dapagliflozin may lower 
endogenous insulin requirements thereby decreasing the burden on beta cells. 
Dapagliflozin appears to decrease blood pressure which, in the frequently obese and hypertensive 
patients with T2DM, could be beneficial. This effect is currently investigated in clinical studies in 
hypertensive patients. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In the Placebo-controlled Pool (Short term treatment period), there was an observed imbalance for the 
following events: genital infections (5.7%-4.8% in dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg versus 0.9% in placebo), 
UTI (5.7%-4.3% in dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg versus 3.7% in placebo) and hypotension (0.6%-0.7% 
in dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg versus 0.4% in placebo). Serious complications of UTI were not seen 
in the studies, but will be assessed in a planned pharmacoepidemiological study. 
The proportions of subjects with elevated liver function tests and AEs of hepatic disorder were similar 
in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups. There was, however, one case of possible drug-induced liver 
injury with positive dechallenge. Thus, liver injury has been included as an important potential risk that 
in the RMP and will be further evaluated in a pharmacoepidemiological study.  
Patients with severe hepatic impairment have on average about 70% increased exposure. It cannot be 
excluded that some patients may have more than 2-fold increase in exposure. There is no clinical 
experience in this sub-group. Hence, in patients with severe hepatic impairment a starting dose of 5 
mg is recommended.  
There were no major episodes of hypoglycaemia when used as monotherapy. When dapagliflozin was 
used together with insulin and SU an increased risk of hypoglycaemic events was observed, mainly 
seen as an increase in minor hypoglycaemic events (6.6 versus 2.1%).

Reactions related to volume depletion (including, but not limited to, reports of dehydration, 
hypovolaemia or hypotension) were reported in 0.8% and 0.4% of subjects who received 
dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. In subjects who received loop diuretics (n=126) the 
incidences of volume depletion were 9.7% and 1.8%, respectively. The use of dapagliflozin is not 
recommended in combination with loop diuretics.  
An increase in LDL-C and total cholesterol (2.7 % and 1.4 % from baseline) was observed after 24 
weeks with a further increase after 102 weeks, which was higher in the dapagliflozin group than in the 
placebo group. There was also an increase in HDL-C and no difference between the groups was seen in 
the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio up to 102 weeks. The clinical relevance of the small increase in LDL cholesterol 
is questionable. This issue will be addressed in the CV outcome study. 
Adverse events related to renal impairment, especially increase in serum creatinine, were seen in 1.2% 
of patients treated with dapagliflozin compared to 0.9 % in the placebo group. The percentage of 
subjects discontinuing due to an adverse renal effect was fairly balanced between dapagliflozin and 
comparator. More patients with dapagliflozin than with comparator reached baseline serum creatinine 
after discontinuation (47.2% versus 27.9%, dapagliflozin versus. comparator) suggesting that at least 
part of the serum creatinine increase during dapagliflozin therapy was due to dehydration and not due 
to progressing renal insufficiency. It has been shown that dapagliflozin treatment results in an initial 
decline in GFR which usually is restored to baseline levels after a few months indicating a transient 
functional effect rather than renal toxicity. Yearly monitoring of renal function is considered acceptable 
with closer monitoring (2-4 times per year) in patients approaching the limit of 60 ml/min/ 1.73m2 to 
capture the time point when dapagliflozin should be discontinued (due to decreasing efficacy and 
potentially increasing safety issues). The GFR cut-off of 60 ml/min/ 1.73m2 provides a reasonable 
safety margin. 
Reversibility of serum creatinine increase will be followed post-marketing within the CV outcome study 
and a pharmacoepidemiological study will further assess the risk of renal impairment. 
At Week 24, the mean changes from baseline in haematocrit were 2.15% in the group treated with 
dapagliflozin 10 mg versus -0.40% in the placebo group. Haematocrit values > 55% were reported in 
1.3% of the subjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg versus 0.3% of placebo subjects.  
The increase in haematocrit with dapagliflozin compared to placebo did not translate into an increased 
incidence of venous thromboembolic events. No further action besides excluding patients at high risk 
for dehydration from treatment is considered necessary at the present time. The planned CV outcome 
study is expected to provide a broader database allowing firmer conclusions. 
Concerning serum electrolytes, in the overall study population increased serum sodium (>150 mEq/L) 
was reported in 1.4 % of patients on dapagliflozin compared to 0.7 % in controls. In the age group > 
65 years the corresponding reporting was 2.0 % in the dapagliflozin compared to 0.6 % for placebo. 
No other differences with regards to electrolytes were observed compared to placebo. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The assessment of uncertainties around unfavourable effects focused on risks that are at this time 
considered as potential and not identified, on the basis of the available information. These potential 
risks are discussed in more details in the paragraphs below.

All types of cancer: the analyses of data with a cut off of June 2010 (dataset submitted with the initial 
MAA) revealed an imbalance in the incidence of all types of cancer between dapagliflozin and controls 
(1.4% versus 1.0%). Additional analyses provided by the applicant during the evaluation (with a 
longer cut-off date of 15th of July 2011, allowing the evaluation of a longer observation period and 
larger patient population) showed no observed difference between dapagliflozin and controls (1.47% 
versus 1.35%, incidence rate ratio: 1.047 (95% CI: 0.702-1.579)). 
When the incidence of different types of cancer was examined in detail (see Figure 22 in section 2.6 
Clinical safety) it was observed that, while some malignancies appear top have a lower incidence than 
in the control (in particular renal cancer), other were increased (namaley bladder, prostate and breast 
cancer) in patients receiving dapagliflozin. It seems therefore a good precautionary measure to 
consider this observation as a concern, and encourage gathering further data in order to either confirm 
or dismiss this risk. It should be noted that non-clinical carcinogenesis studies did not reveal 
tumourigenic effects of dapagliflozin. A causal relationship of dapagliflozin administration and breast 
cancer appears unlikely due to the lack of plausible underlying mechanism (e.g. increased estrogens 
levels). Furthermore, all observed breast cancers and almost all prostate cancers were detected early 
in study course which may indicate pre-existing tumours. For prostate cancer a causal relationship 
appears unlikely for similar reasons. On the other hand, there may, theoretically, be a plausible 
mechanism by which dapagliflozin could increase growth of pre-existing neoplasms in the bladder (i.e. 
by increasing glucose concentration in the urine) even though the scientific support of this hypothesis 
is very limited, and it may contradict the observed lower incidence of renal tract tumours with 
dapagliflozin compared to comparator. Thus, the observed difference in the incidence of bladder cancer 
may well be explained by random variation or detection bias due to an increased frequency of 
urogenital adverse reactions with dapagliflozin.  
In summary, post-marketing surveillance of breast, prostate and bladder cancer as the most 
appropriate means to further evaluate this potential risk is foreseen within planned studies (as detailed 
in the RMP), including the planned CV outcome study and an epidemiological study. Considering the 
possible association of pioglitazone and bladder cancer, the combination of dapagliflozin and 
pioglitazone is not recommended, and, as a precautionary measure, this information has been included 
in the SmPC. 
For dapagliflozin treated patients, bone resorption markers, serum phosphorus and PTH were 
somewhat higher than in the comparator group with PTH increases being higher in patients with 
already elevated baseline PTH plasma concentrations. Moreover, in a study of diabetic subjects with 
moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to <60 ml/min/ 1.73m2), AEs of fracture were reported in a 
higher proportion of dapagliflozin-treated subjects (3 [3.6%] and 7 [8.2%] in the 5 and 10 mg groups, 
respectively) compared with placebo-treated subjects (0%), particularly in those patients with the 
lowest eGFR values at baseline. One-year data in patients with no or only mild renal impairment and 
treated with dapagliflozin did not reveal any relevant changes in BMD. However, dapagliflozin-related 
bone loss with long-term treatment cannot be fully excluded even with a slight increase in PTH, which 
would be particularly relevant in patients with pre-existing or at risk of osteoporosis. Two-year BMD 
data are awaited post-marketing (as detailed in the RMP).

The assessment of CV safety was based on a meta-analysis of independently confirmed, blindly 
adjudicated, CV events among Phase IIb and III studies. No increased CV risk was observed, neither in 
the original, nor in the updated analysis for the primary composite endpoint (HR 0.819, 95% CI: 
0.583, 1.152 in the updated analysis) or for MACE events (HR 0.793, 95% CI: 0.537, 1.170). 
However, in the pooled analysis of studies D1690C00018 and D1690C00019 including only patients at 
high CV risk, the HR for MACE was 1.27 (95 % CI 0.693-2.311). The absolute number of cases in these 
ongoing trials is still small and the small imbalance among treatment groups should be interpreted with 
caution. Further, an analysis of data in all patients with CV disease from the Phase IIb/III study pool 
including the new studies D1690C00018 and D1690C0019 showed no increased MACE rate, neither at 
initiation of dapagliflozin therapy nor later on. However, it cannot be excluded that patients at high CV 
risk concomitantly taking loop diuretics and/or antihypertensive drugs may be at increased risk for a 
CV events when starting dapagliflozin, possibly due to diuresis-induced decreased blood pressure. The 
SmPC has been amended to highlight the blood pressure-lowering effect and potential safety issues in 
vulnerable patients. 
In a subgroup analysis of patients with eGFR ≥45 to <60 ml/min/1.73m2, initially proposed to be 
appropriate for treatment with dapagliflozin, increase in blood creatinine (5.2 % versus 0 %), 
phosphorus (5.2 % versus 2.9 %), PTH (mean increase 5.5 pg/mL versus 2.6 pg/mL) and hypotension 
(volume depletion 3.0%, 2.3%, and 4.7% of subjects in the dapagliflozin 2.5, 5, and 10 mg groups, 
respectively, and 1.4% in the placebo group) was more evident than in the placebo-controlled pool. 
Due to limited efficacy and potentially increased safety issues, the use of dapagliflozin is not 
recommended in this patient group.  
The overall safety profile in elderly with minor renal impairment or normal renal function does not 
indicate major differences compared to younger patients. However in patients ≥ 65 years (1335 
patients) the difference from placebo was more evident for events of renal impairment (2.5 % versus 
1.1 % ST; 4.5 % versus 1.9 % LT), hypotension and volume depletion (3.1%, 0.5%, and 1.5% in the 
dapagliflozin 2.5, 5, and 10 mg groups, respectively; versus 0.4 % for placebo). Data in the elderly 
patient group > 75 years (157 patients) is limited and initiation of treatment is not recommended in 
these patients. 
Concerns arose whether the long-term catabolic effects elicited by dapagliflozin-induced nutrient loss 
may differ from those caused by reduction in dietary intake, e.g. with regard to protein turnover. 
However, published data have been provided indicating that the observed effects are not qualitatively 
or quantitatively different to those observed with a reduction in dietary intake. There was no evidence 
for increased risk of acidosis with dapagliflozin, which would be of particular concern with concomitant 
metformin therapy. Concerns also arose with regard to the potential long term consequences of the 
induced osmotic diuresis, e.g. with respect to effect on serum electrolytes. By inducing osmotic 
diuresis and weak natriuresis, dapagliflozin exerts qualitatively similar effects as thiazide diuretics. 
Since the latter are a well-established and widely prescribed substance class the potential risk and 
necessary precautions are understood by the prescribers. It has been demonstrated that dapagliflozin 
causes similar adaptive changes as hydrochlorothiazide albeit, in general to a smaller extent. Thus, the 
risks associated with dapagliflozin-induced diuresis appear manageable.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Dapagliflozin, at the proposed dose of 10 mg/d, has been shown to effectively lower HbA1c when given 
alone or in combination with various antidiabetics with different mechanism of action with the effect 
being similar to that of glipizide (at week 52) and metformin XR. The effect of dapagliflozin appears to 
be maintained in the long-term (up to 102 weeks).  
Dapagliflozin has a unique mechanism of action, not involving the stimulation of beta cells. This may 
be of great importance for patients with unsatisfactory glycaemic control due to beta-cell failure. 
The additional beneficial effects on body weight and blood pressure are of special interest in the T2DM 
population where overweight associated with increased insulin resistance as well as hypertension 
constitute significant treatment challenges. Further to this, increase in body weight is commonly seen 
when hyperglycaemia is successfully treated.  
The low propensity of dapagliflozin to cause hypoglycaemia is considered a beneficial effect which may 
be particularly relevant in patients at increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Other potentially clinically relevant beneficial effects such as reduction in blood pressure in 
hypertensive patients or long-term improvement in beta cell function are not clear and would need to 
be further investigated. 
It should however be noted that the efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal function and 
efficacy is reduced in patients who have moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with 
severe renal impairment. 
For dapagliflozin, several of the safety issues are associated with the mechanism of action (glucosuria 
and diuretic effect). Genital and urinary tract infections can be troublesome for the patients but are 
considered as manageable in clinical practice. The increase in urinary tract infections associated with 
dapagliflozin was relatively small and events were generally mild or moderate in intensity not 
indicating a major safety issue. 
The incidences of adverse events possibly secondary to osmotic diuresis (hypotension, volume 
depletion, changes in electrolytes and elevated haematocrit) were low in the studied population. These 
issues are reflected in the product information and will be further studied in planned studies. There are 
however patient groups who may be more sensitive to consequences of osmotic diuresis, e.g. elderly 
and volume depleted patients (e.g treated with diuretics) as well as patients with renal impairment.  
The numbers of such patients in the clinical trials were limited, but data indicate a higher incidence of 
adverse events. Appropriate warnings and restrictions have been included in the SmPC to minimise the 
risk in vulnerable patients. The current cut-off for renal function of 60 mg/min/1.73 m2 for treatment 
with dapagliflozin includes a reasonable safety margin. Off-label use is intended to be studied post-
marketing, which is considered appropriate. 
It seems to be appropriate to conduct long term post-marketing studies in order to assess the potential 
risk of bladder, breast and prostate cancers in dapagliflozin-treated patients; Although the incidence of 
all types cancer was not increased in dapagliflozin-treated patients, long treatment periods and a 
possible wide spread use warrant a careful and cautious evaluation of accrued clinical data. It is 
reassuring that data from carcinogenicity studies in animals are not indicating a genotoxic or 
carcinogenic effect of dapagliflozin. This approach of gathering further data and carefully assessing it is 
considered sufficient by the CHMP.

Several CV meta-analyses including the general study population or only patients with CV disease do 
not indicate an increased CV risk associated with the use of dapagliflozin. Nevertheless, it cannot be 
excluded that high risk patients, especially those concomitantly taking loop diuretics and/or 
antihypertensive drugs may be at increased risk for a CV events when starting dapagliflozin, possibly 
due to a diuresis-induced decrease in blood pressure. Therefore, the product information has been 
amended to create awareness of the diuresis-inducing and blood pressure-lowering effect of 
dapagliflozin among physicians and patients. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The balance between favourable and unfavourable effects of dapagliflozin is considered positive. 
Dapagliflozin, at the proposed dose of 10 mg/d, has been shown to effectively lower HbA1c when given 
alone or in combination with various glucose-lowering agents with different mechanisms of action. In 
addition, beneficial effects on body weight and blood pressure have been observed. Common adverse 
events are associated with the mechanism of action (glucosuria and diuretic effect) and are considered 
as manageable in clinical practice. Due to increased exposure to dapagliflozin in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment, a lower starting dose of 5 mg is recommended in this population. If well tolerated, 
the dose may be increased to 10 mg. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit/risk of dapagliflozin is considered positive for the indication: “In adults aged 18 
years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as: 
Monotherapy  
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of 
metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance. 
Add-on combination therapy 
In combination with other glucose lowering drugs including insulin, when these, together with diet and 
exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data 
on different combinations).” 
Due to the dependence of efficacy on renal function and the observation of an increased likelihood to 
experience adverse drug reactions with relevant renal impairment, the use of dapagliflozin should be 
restricted to patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function (i.e. GFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and 
to patients under the age of 75 year. Precautions regarding use of dapagliflozin in patients at risk of 
volume depletion and in patients in whom the blood pressure-lowering effect of dapagliflozin could 
pose a potential risk has been included in the SmPC. The potential risk of bladder, breast and prostate 
cancers in dapagliflozin-treated patients as well as CV safety in high CV risk patients will be further 
investigated in planned post-marketing studies which is considered sufficient.

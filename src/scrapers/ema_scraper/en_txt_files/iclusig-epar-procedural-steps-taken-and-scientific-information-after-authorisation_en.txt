parameters were reduced at dose levels corresponding to 
human clinical exposures. Evidence for pre- and post-
implantation loss of embryos was reported in female rats 
and ponatinib may therefore impair female fertility.  There 
were no effects on male rat fertility parameters.  The 
clinical relevance of these findings on human fertility is 
unknown. 
In a two-year carcinogenicity study in male and female 
rats, oral administration of ponatinib at 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 
mg/kg/day in males and at 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg/day in 
females did not result in any tumorigenic effects.  The 0.8 
mg/kg/day dose in females resulted in a plasma exposure 
level generally lower or equivalent to the human exposure 
at the range of dose from 15 mg to 45 mg daily. A 
statistically significant increased incidence of squamous cell 
carcinoma of the clitoral gland was observed at that dose. 
The clinical relevance of this finding for humans is not 
known.

Co administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as

Drug-drug interaction study with lansoprazole (Study 
AP24534-12-108): Co-administration of Iclusig with a 
potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion resulted in a minor 
reduction in ponatinib Cmax without a reduction in AUC0-
∞. 
Study in patients with chronic hepatic impairment (Study 
AP24534-12- 109): Patients with  hepatic impairment may 
receive the recommended starting dose. Caution is 
recommended when administering Iclusig to patients with 
severe hepatic impairment. 
Interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors (Study ARI-001A): 
Caution should be exercised and a reduction of the starting 
dose of Iclusig to 30 mg should be considered with 
concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors such as 
clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
troleandomycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit juice. 
Plasma protein binding (Study ARP350): Ponatinib is not 
displaced by concomitant administration of ibuprofen, 
nifedipine, propranolol, salicylic acid, or warfarin. 
Information on contraception (Study XT133050): It is 
unknown whether ponatinib affects the effectiveness of 
systemic hormonal contraceptives. An alternative or 
additional method of contraception should be used. 
Plasma samples and metabolite profile (Study ARP395): 
The metabolite profile of the post 24-hr plasma samples 
was consistent with that of the pre 24-hr samples, and no 
new metabolites were detected in the post 24-hr plasma.

Dawley rats (study 902650) show that ponatinib 
administration resulted in deaths related to inflammatory 
effects at 3.0 mg/kg/day after 6 or 7 days of treatment. 
These deaths were attributed to an inflammatory process 
resulting in multiple organ failure. Decreases in body 
weight gain were evident at doses of ≥ 0.75 mg/kg/day 
during the pre-weaning and early post-weaning treatment 
phases, which recovered during a post-treatment phase 
from Day 35 to 63 pp. No other adverse changes in 
developmental parameters (vaginal opening, preputial 
separation or bone measurements) were observed. As a

studies (a phase I dose-finding study and a pivotal phase II 
study), showed a higher incidence of arterial and venous 
thrombotic events in patients treated with Iclusig than was 
observed at the time of marketing authorisation. In the 
phase I study, follow-up data from September 2013 
showed a rate of serious occlusive vascular events of 22% 
(18 out of 81 patients) while in the phase II study the rate 
was 13.8% (62 out of 449 patients). In addition, in a 
recently discontinued phase III study comparing Iclusig 
with imatinib, there was a higher number of occlusive 
vascular events reported in the Iclusig arm, although the 
data from this study are still preliminary. As a 
consequence, sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC were 
updated in order to include recommendations not to use 
Iclusig in patients with a history of heart attack or stroke, 
unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the 
risks. The cardiovascular status of patients should be 
assessed and cardiovascular risk factors actively managed 
before starting treatment with Iclusig and cardiovascular 
status should continue to be monitored and optimised 
during treatment. Hypertension should be controlled during 
Page 27/28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment with Iclusig and healthcare professionals should 
consider interrupting treatment if hypertension is not 
controlled. Finally patients should be monitored for 
evidence of vascular occlusion or thromboembolism, and 
treatment should be interrupted immediately if this occurs. 
Finally, the terms retinal vein occlusion and visual 
impairment were included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

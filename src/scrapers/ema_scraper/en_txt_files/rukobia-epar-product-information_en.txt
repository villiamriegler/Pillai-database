CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Rukobia, in combination with other antiretrovirals, is indicated for the treatment of adults with 
multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive 
anti-viral regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Rukobia should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 600 mg of fostemsavir twice daily. 
Missed doses 
If the patient misses a dose of fostemsavir, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as the 
patient remembers, unless it is almost time for the next dose. In this case, the missed dose should be 
skipped and the next dose should be taken according to the regular schedule. The patient should not 
take a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose.  
Elderly 
No dosage adjustment is required (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment or those on haemodialysis (see 
section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of fostemsavir in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not yet 
been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made.  
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Fostemsavir can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). The prolonged-release tablet should 
be swallowed whole with water, and not chewed, crushed or split. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers including, but not limited to: carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, mitotane, enzalutamide, rifampicin and St John’s wort (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of anti-retroviral 
therapy (ART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may 
arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have 
been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of ART.  Relevant examples are 
cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci 
(formerly P. carinii) pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms must be evaluated without delay and 
treatment initiated when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, autoimmune 
hepatitis, polymyositis and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of 
immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after 
initiation of treatment and sometimes can be an atypical presentation. 
QTc prolongation 
A supratherapeutic dose (at a Cmax approximately 4.2-fold the therapeutic dose) of fostemsavir has 
been shown to significantly prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (see section 5.1). 
Fostemsavir should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, when 
co-administered with a medicine with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes (e.g. amiodarone, 
disopyramide, ibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, or sotalol) or in patients with relevant pre-existing 
cardiac disease. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-induced QT interval prolongation.  
Patients with hepatitis B or C virus co-infection 
Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended in patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection. 
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an 
increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral 
therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal 
products. 
Opportunistic infections 
Patients should be advised that fostemsavir or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV 
infection and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV 
infection. Therefore, patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experienced in the treatment of these associated HIV diseases. 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, 
biphosphonates, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of 
osteonecrosis have been reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to 
combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they 
experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
Restricted range of antiviral activity  
In vitro data indicate that the antiviral activity of temsavir is restricted to HIV-1 Group M strains. 
Rukobia should not be used to treat infections due to HIV-1 strains other than those of Group M (see 
section 5.1). 
Within HIV-1 group M, there is considerably reduced antiviral activity against CRF01_AE virus. 
Available data indicate that this subtype has a natural occurring resistance to temsavir (see section 
5.1). It is recommended that Rukobia is not used to treat infections due to HIV-1 Group M subtype 
CRF01_AE strains. 
Interactions with other medicinal products 
Co-administration of fostemsavir with elbasvir/grazoprevir is not recommended as increased 
grazoprevir concentrations may increase the risk of ALT elevations (see section 4.5). 
Dose modifications and/or careful titration of dose is recommended for certain statins that are 
substrates of OATP1B1/3 or BCRP (rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, simvastatin and 
fluvastatin) when co-administered with fostemsavir (see section 4.5). 
When fostemsavir was co-administered with oral contraceptives, temsavir increased concentrations of 
ethinyl oestradiol. Doses of oestrogen-based therapies, including oral contraceptives, should not 
contain more than 30 µg of ethinyl oestradiol per day in patients who are receiving fostemsavir (see 
section 4.5). Furthermore, caution is advised particularly in patients with additional risk factors for 
thromboembolic events. 
When fostemsavir is co-administered with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), temsavir is expected to 
increase plasma concentrations of TAF via inhibition of OATP1B1/3 and/or BCRP. The 
recommended dose of TAF is 10 mg when co-administered with fostemsavir (see section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Effect of other medical products on the pharmacokinetics of temsavir  
Temsavir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), but not 
of organic anion transporters OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Its biotransformation to two circulating 
metabolites, BMS-646915 and BMS-930644, is mediated by unidentified esterases (36.1%) and by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 enzyme (21.2%), respectively.  
When fostemsavir was co-administered with the strong CYP3A inducer rifampicin, a significant 
reduction in temsavir plasma concentrations was observed. Significant decreases in temsavir plasma 
concentrations may also occur when fostemsavir is co-administered with other strong CYP3A 
inducers, and may result in loss of virologic response (see section 4.3). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fostemsavir may be co-administered with strong CYP3A4, BCRP and/or P-gp inhibitors (e.g., 
clarithromycin, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole) without dose adjustment based on the 
results of clinical drug interaction studies with cobicistat and ritonavir.   
Effect of temsavir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products  
In vitro, temsavir inhibited OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (IC50 = 32 and 16 µM, respectively). 
Additionally, temsavir and its two metabolites (BMS-646915 and BMS-930644) inhibited BCRP (IC50 
= 12, 35, and 3.5 to 6.3 µM, respectively). Based on these data, temsavir is expected to affect the 
pharmacokinetics of active substances that are substrates of OATP1B1/3 or BCRP (e.g. rosuvastatin, 
atorvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin and fluvastatin). Therefore, dose modifications and/or careful 
titration of dose is recommended for certain statins.

Rifabutin decreased temsavir plasma 
concentrations. No dose adjustment is 
necessary. 
Rifabutin co-administered with 
ritonavir increased temsavir plasma 
concentrations. No dose adjustment is 
necessary. 
Rifampicin co-administration may 
lead to loss of virologic response to 
fostemsavir due to significant 
decreases in temsavir plasma 
concentrations caused by strong 
CYP3A4 induction. Therefore, the 
concomitant use of fostemsavir and 
rifampicin is contraindicated. 
Although not studied, concomitant 
use of fostemsavir and other strong 
CYP3A4 inducers is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3).  
Coadministration of fostemsavir 
increases rosuvastatin plasma 
concentrations caused by 
OATP1B1/3 and/or BCRP inhibition 
by temsavir. Therefore use the lowest 
possible starting dose of rosuvastatin 
with careful monitoring. 
Although not studied, use the lowest 
possible starting dose of other statins 
that are substrates of OATP1B1/3 
and/or BCRP with careful monitoring 
for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor-
associated adverse reactions.  
Although not studied, clinically 
relevant increases in plasma 
concentrations of pravastatin are not 
expected as it is not a substrate of 
BCRP. No dose adjustment is 
required.

Temsavir may increase grazoprevir 
plasma concentrations to a clinically 
relevant extent caused by 
OATP1B1/3 inhibition by temsavir. 
Co-administration of fostemsavir with 
elbasvir/grazoprevir is not 
recommended as increased 
grazoprevir concentrations may 
increase the risk of ALT elevations. 
Although not studied, temsavir may 
increase plasma concentrations of 
other HCV DAAs. No dose 
adjustment is necessary.

1Potential mechanism(s) of drug interactions 
QT prolonging medicinal products  
There is no information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between 
fostemsavir and medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval of the ECG. However, based on a 
study of healthy subjects, in which a supratherapeutic dose of fostemsavir prolonged the QTc interval, 
fostemsavir should be used with caution when co-administered with a medicinal product with a known 
risk of Torsade de Pointes (see sections 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of 
fostemsavir in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at 
exposure levels of temsavir in the range of the recommended human dose (RHD) (see section 5.3). In 
pregnant rats fostemsavir and/or its metabolites cross the placenta and are distributed to all foetal 
tissues. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Rukobia during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding  
It is recommended that  women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid 
transmission of HIV. 
It is unknown whether fostemsavir/temsavir are excreted in human milk. Available toxicokinetic data 
in lactating rats have shown excretion of fostemsavir/temsavir in milk (see section 5.3).

There are no data on the effects of fostemsavir on human male or female fertility. Animal studies 
indicate no effects of fostemsavir on male or female fertility at clinically relevant doses (see section 
5.3).   
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Fostemsavir has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
informed that headache, dizziness and somnolence have been reported during treatment with 
fostemsavir (see section 4.8). The clinical status of the patient and the adverse reaction profile of 
fostemsavir should be borne in mind when considering the patient's ability to drive or operate 
machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (see section 
4.4). The most commonly seen treatment emergent adverse reactions were diarrhoea (24%), headache 
(17%), nausea (15%), rash (12%), abdominal pain (12%), and vomiting (11%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions identified in clinical trials are listed in Table 2 by body system, organ class and 
frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Changes in laboratory chemistries  
Increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were observed following treatment with fostemsavir, 
which were mainly mild or moderate. These changes were rarely associated with musculoskeletal 
complaints and are not considered clinically relevant.  
Clinically relevant increases in serum creatinine have primarily occurred in patients with identifiable 
risk factors for reduced renal function, including pre-existing medical history of renal disease and/or 
concomitant medications known to cause increases in creatinine. A causal association between 
fostemsavir and elevation in serum creatinine has not been established. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Asymptomatic elevations in creatinine, creatine phosphokinase and liver enzymes were mainly grade 
1 or 2 and did not require interruption of treatment 
Increases in direct (conjugated) bilirubin have been observed following treatment with fostemsavir. 
Cases of clinical significance were uncommon and were confounded by the presence of intercurrent 
serious comorbid events not related to dosing with study medication (e.g. sepsis, cholangiocarcinoma 
or other complications of viral hepatitis co-infection). In the remaining reports, elevations in direct 
bilirubin (without clinical jaundice) were typically transient, occurred without increases in liver 
transaminases and resolved on continued fostemsavir.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific treatment for overdose with fostemsavir. In case of overdose, it is recommended 
that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and given appropriate 
symptomatic treatment. Standard supportive measures should be applied as required, including 
monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. As temsavir is 
highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis. 
Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons 
centre, where available.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX29.  
Mechanism of action 
Fostemsavir is a prodrug without significant antiviral activity that is hydrolysed to the active moiety, 
temsavir, upon cleavage of a phosphonooxymethyl group in vivo (see section 5.2). Temsavir binds 
directly to the gp120 subunit within the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 and selectively inhibits 
the interaction between the virus and cellular CD4 receptor, thereby preventing viral entry into, and 
infection of, host cells.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Antiviral activity in cell culture 
Temsavir exhibited variable activity across HIV-1 subtypes. Temsavir IC50 value ranged from 0.01 to 
>2000 nM against clinical isolates of subtypes A, B, B', C, D, F, G and CRF01_AE in PBMCs. 
Temsavir was not active against HIV-2. Due to high frequencies of polymorphism S375H (98%) and 
S375M/M426L/M434I (100%) temsavir is not active against Group O and Group N (see section 4.4).   
Against a panel of 1337 clinical isolates tested with the PhenoSense Entry assay, the mean IC50 value 
was 1.73 nM (range 0.018 to >5000 nM). Isolates tested included subtype B (n=881), C (n=156), F1 
(n=48), A (n=43), BF1 (n=29), BF (n=19), A1 (n=17) and CRF01_AE (n=5). Subtype CRF01_AE 
was associated with higher IC50 values (5/5 isolates with temsavir IC50 values >100 nM). CRF01_AE 
is considered naturally resistant to temsavir on the basis of available data, due to the presence of 
polymorphisms at positions S375H and M475I (see below).

Antiviral activity in combination with other antiviral agents 
When tested with temsavir in vitro, no antagonism was seen with abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, 
lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir disoproxil, zidovudine, efavirenz, nevirapine, atazanavir, indinavir, 
lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, enfuvirtide, maraviroc, ibalizumab, delavirdine, rilpivirine, darunavir, 
dolutegravir or raltegravir. In addition, antivirals without inherent anti-HIV activity (entecavir, 
ribavirin) have no apparent effect on temsavir activity. 
Resistance in vitro 
Serial passage of lab-strains LAI, NL4-3, or Bal, in increasing concentrations of temsavir (TMR) over 
14 to 49 days resulted in gp120 substitutions at L116, A204, M426, M434 and M475. Phenotypes of 
recombinant LAI viruses containing TMR-selected substitutions were investigated. Additionally, 
phenotypes of viruses with substitutions at position S375 that were identified in pre-treatment samples 
in fostemsavir clinical studies were evaluated. The phenotypes of those considered clinically relevant 
are tabulated below (Table 3).

Temsavir remained active against laboratory derived CD4-independent viruses.  
Cross-Resistance 
There was no evidence of cross-resistance to representative agents from other antiretroviral (ARV) 
classes. Temsavir retained wild-type activity against viruses resistant to the INSTI raltegravir; the 
NNRTIs rilpivirine and efavirenz; the NRTIs abacavir, lamivudine, tenofovir, zidovudine and the PIs 
atazanavir and darunavir. Additionally, abacavir, tenofovir, efavirenz, rilpivirine, atazanavir, darunavir 
and raltegravir retained activity against site-directed mutant viruses with reduced temsavir 
susceptibility (S375M, M426L, or M426L plus M475I). 
No cross-resistance was observed between temsavir and maraviroc or enfuvirtide. Temsavir was active 
against viruses with resistance to enfuvirtide. Some CCR5-tropic, maraviroc-resistant, viruses showed 
reduced susceptibility to temsavir, however, there was no absolute correlation between maraviroc 
resistance and reduced sensitivity to temsavir. Maraviroc and enfuvirtide retained activity against 
clinical envelopes from the Phase IIa study (206267) that had reduced susceptibility to temsavir and 
contained S375H, M426L, or M426L plus M475I substitutions.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Temsavir was active against several ibalizumab-resistant viruses. Ibalizumab retained activity against 
site-directed mutant viruses that had reduced susceptibility to temsavir (S375M, M426L, or M426L 
plus M475I). HIV-1 gp120 E202 was identified as a rare treatment-emergent substitution in 
BRIGHTE that can reduce susceptibility to temsavir, and, depending on the sequence context of the 
envelope, may also result in reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab. 
Virologic response at Day 8 by genotype and phenotype in BRIGHTE 
The effect of the gp120 resistance-associated polymorphisms (RAPs) on response to fostemsavir 
functional monotherapy at Day 8 was assessed in the Phase III study (BRIGHTE [205888]) in heavily 
treatment-experienced adult subjects. The presence of gp120 RAPs at key sites S375, M426, M434, or 
M475 was associated with a lower overall decline in HIV-1 RNA and fewer subjects achieving >0.5 
log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA compared with subjects with no changes at these sites (Table 4).  
The fold change in susceptibility to temsavir for subject isolates at screening was highly variable 
ranging from 0.06 to 6,651. The effect of screening fostemsavir phenotype on response of >0.5 log10 
decline at Day 8 was assessed in the ITT-E population (Table 5). While there does appear to be a trend 
toward reduced clinical response at higher TMR IC50 values, this baseline variable fails to reliably 
predict efficacy outcomes in the intended use population.

Antiviral activity against subtype AE 
Within HIV-1 Group M, temsavir showed considerably reduced antiviral activity against subtype AE 
isolates. Rukobia is not recommended to be used to treat infections due to HIV-1 Group M subtype 
CRF01_AE strains. Genotyping of subtype AE viruses identified polymorphisms at amino acid 
positions S375H and M475I in gp120, which have been associated with reduced susceptibility to 
fostemsavir. Subtype AE is a predominant subtype in Southeast Asia, but it is not found frequently 
elsewhere. 
Two subjects in the Randomised Cohort had subtype AE virus at screening. One subject (EC50 fold 
change >4,747-fold and gp120 substitutions at S375H and M475I at baseline) did not respond to 
fostemsavir at Day 8. The second subject (EC50 fold change 298-fold and gp120 substitution at S375N 
at baseline) received placebo during functional monotherapy. Both subjects had HIV RNA <40 
copies/mL at Week 96 while receiving fostemsavir plus OBT that included dolutegravir. 
Emergence of Resistance in vivo 
The percentage of subjects who experienced virologic failure through the Week 96 analysis was 25% 
(69/272) in the randomised cohort (Table 6). Overall, 50% (26/52) of the viruses of evaluable subjects 
with virologic failure in the Randomised Cohort had treatment-emergent gp120 genotypic 
substitutions at 4 key sites (S375, M426, M434, and M475).  
The median temsavir EC50 fold change at failure in randomised evaluable subject isolates with 
emergent gp120 substitutions at positions 375, 426, 434, or 475 (n = 26) was 1,755-fold compared to 
3-fold for isolates with no emergent gp120 substitutions at these positions (n = 26).  
Of the 25 evaluable subjects in the Randomised Cohort with virologic failure and emergent 
substitutions S375N and M426L and (less frequently) S375H/M, M434I and M475I, 88% (22/25) had 
temsavir IC50 FC Ratio > 3-fold (FC Ratio is temsavir IC50 FC on-treatment compared to baseline). 
Overall, 21/69 (30%) of the virus isolates of patients with virologic failure in the Randomised Cohort 
had genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one drug in the OBT at screening and in 48% 
(31/64) of the virologic failures with post-baseline data the virus isolates had emergent resistance to at 
least one drug in the OBT.   
In the Non-randomised Cohort virologic failures were observed in 51% (50/99) through Week 96 
(Table 6). While the proportion of viruses with gp120 resistance-associated substitutions at screening 
was similar between patients in the Randomised and Non-randomised Cohorts, the proportion of virus 
isolates with emergent gp120 resistance-associated substitutions at the time of failure was higher 
among Non-randomised patients (75% vs. 50%). The median temsavir EC50 fold change at failure in 
Non-randomised evaluable subject isolates with emergent substitutions at positions 375, 426, 434, or 
475 (n = 33) was 4,216-fold and compared to 402-fold for isolates without substitutions at these 
positions (n = 11).  
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 32 evaluable virologic failures in the Non-randomised Cohort with emergent substitutions 
S375N and M426L and (less frequently) S375H/M, M434I and M475I, 91% (29/32) had temsavir IC50 
FC Ratio > 3-fold. 
Overall, 45/50 (90%) of the viruses of patients with virologic failure in the Non-randomised Cohort 
had genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one drug in the OBT at screening and in 55% 
(27/49) of the virologic failures with post-baseline data the virus isolates had emergent resistance to at 
least one drug in the OBT.

Effects on electrocardiogram 
In a randomised, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind, cross-over thorough QT study, 60 
healthy subjects received oral administration of placebo, fostemsavir 1 200 mg once daily, fostemsavir 
2 400 mg twice daily and moxifloxacin 400 mg (active control) in random sequence. Fostemsavir 
administered at 1 200 mg once daily did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the QTc interval as 
the maximum mean time-matched (2-sided 90% upper confidence bound) placebo-adjusted QTc 
change from baseline based on Fridericia’s correction method (QTcF) was 4.3 (6.3) milliseconds 
(below the clinically important threshold of 10 milliseconds). However, fostemsavir administered at 
2 400 mg twice daily for 7 days was associated with a clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc 
interval as the maximum mean time-matched (2-sided 90% upper confidence bound) for the placebo-
adjusted change from baseline in QTcF interval was 11.2 (13.3) milliseconds. Steady-state 
administration of fostemsavir 600 mg twice daily resulted in a mean temsavir Cmax approximately 4.2-
fold lower than the temsavir concentration predicted to increase QTcF interval 10 milliseconds (see 
section 4.4). 
Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of fostemsavir in HIV-infected, heavily treatment-experienced adult subjects is based on 
data from a Phase III, partially-randomised, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BRIGHTE (205888), conducted in 371 heavily-treatment experienced HIV-1 infected subjects with 
multi-class resistance. All subjects were required to have a viral load greater than or equal to 400 
copies/mL and ≤2 antiretroviral (ARV) classes remaining at baseline due to resistance, intolerability, 
contraindication, or other safety concerns.  
At Screening, subjects from the Randomised Cohort had one but no more than two fully active and 
available ARVs which could be combined as part of an efficacious background regimen. 272 subjects 
received either blinded fostemsavir, 600 mg twice daily (n= 203), or placebo (n= 69), in addition to 
their current failing regimen, for 8 days of functional monotherapy. Beyond Day 8, Randomised 
subjects received open-label fostemsavir, 600 mg twice daily, plus an optimised background therapy 
(OBT). The Randomised Cohort provides primary evidence of efficacy of fostemsavir.  
Within the Non-randomised Cohort, 99 subjects with no fully active, approved ARVs available at 
Screening, were treated with open-label fostemsavir, 600 mg twice daily, plus OBT from Day 1 
onward. The use of an investigational drug(s) as a component of the OBT was permitted.

* Includes subjects who never initiated OBT, were incorrectly assigned to the Randomised Cohort or had one or more active 
ARV agents available at screening but did not use these as part of the initial OBT. 
In the Randomised Cohort, viral load <200 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL was achieved in 68%, 69% and 
64% of subjects at Weeks 24, 48 and 96, respectively. At these timepoints, the proportion of subjects 
with viral load <400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL was 75%, 70% and 64%, respectively (ITT-E, Snapshot 
algorithm). Mean changes in CD4+ T-cell count from baseline continued to increase over time (i.e. 
90 cells/mm3 at Week 24, 139 cells/mm3 at Week 48 and 205 cells/mm3 at Week 96). Based on a sub-
analysis in the Randomised Cohort, subjects with the lowest baseline CD4+ T-cell counts (<20 
cells/mm3) had a similar increase in CD4+ count over time compared with subjects with higher 
baseline CD4+ T-cell count (>50, >100, >200 cells/mm3).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Rukobia in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in HIV infection (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The pharmacokinetics of temsavir following administration of fostemsavir are similar between healthy 
and HIV-1 infected subjects. In HIV-1 infected subjects, the between-subject variability (%CV) in 
plasma temsavir Cmax and AUC ranged from 20.5 to 63% and Cτ from 20 to 165%. Between-subject 
variability in oral clearance and oral central volume of distribution estimated from population 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetic analysis of healthy subjects from selected Phase I studies and HIV-1 infected patients 
were 43% and 48%, respectively.  
Absorption 
Fostemsavir is a prodrug that is metabolised to temsavir by alkaline phosphatase at the luminal surface 
of the small intestine and is generally not detectable in plasma following oral administration. The 
active moiety, temsavir, is readily absorbed with the median time to maximal plasma concentrations 
(Tmax) at 2 hours post dose (fasted). Temsavir is absorbed across the small intestine and 
caecum/proximal ascending colon.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters following multiple oral doses of fostemsavir 600 mg twice daily in HIV-1 
infected, adult subjects are shown in Table 12.

a.  Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses with or without food, in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. 
CV = Coefficient of Variation. 
The absolute bioavailability of temsavir was 26.9% following oral administration of a single 600 mg 
dose of fostemsavir.  
Effect of Food  
Temsavir bioavailability (AUC) was not impacted by a standard meal (approximately 423 kcal, 36% 
fat) but increased 81% with a high-fat meal (approximately 985 kcal, 60% fat) and is not considered 
clinically significant. Regardless of calorie and fat content, food had no impact on plasma temsavir 
Cmax.  
Distribution 
Temsavir is approximately 88% bound to human plasma proteins based on in vivo data. Human serum 
albumin is the major contributor to plasma protein binding of temsavir in humans. The volume of 
distribution of temsavir at steady state (Vss) following intravenous administration is estimated at 
29.5 L. The blood-to-plasma total radiocarbon Cmax ratio was approximately 0.74, indicating minimal 
association of temsavir or its metabolites with red blood cells. Free fraction of temsavir in plasma was 
approximately 12 to 18% in healthy subjects, 23% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, and 
19% in subjects with severe renal impairment, and 12% in HIV-1 infected patients.  
Biotransformation 
In vivo, temsavir is primarily metabolised via esterase hydrolysis (36.1% of administered dose) and 
secondarily by CYP3A4-mediated oxidative (21.2% of administered dose) pathways. Other non-
CYP3A4 metabolites account for 7.2% of the administered dose. Glucuronidation is a minor metabolic 
pathway (<1% of administered dose). 
Temsavir is extensively metabolised, accounting for the fact that only 3% of the administered dose is 
recovered in human urine and faeces. Temsavir is biotransformed into two predominant circulating 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inactive metabolites, BMS-646915 (a product of hydrolysis) and BMS-930644 (a product of N-
dealkylation).  
Interactions 
Significant interactions are not expected when fostemsavir is co-administered with substrates of CYPs, 
uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs), P-gp, multidrug resistance protein (MRP)2, 
bile salt export pump (BSEP), sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), OAT1, 
OAT3, organic cation transporters (OCT)1, and OCT2 based on in vitro and clinical drug interaction 
data. Based on in vitro data, temsavir and its two metabolites (BMS-646915 and BMS-930644) 
inhibited multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1/2K; this interaction is unlikely to be of 
clinical significance. 
Elimination 
Temsavir has a terminal half-life of approximately 11 hours. Plasma temsavir clearance following 
intravenous administration was 17.9 L/hr, and the apparent clearance (CL/F) following oral 
administration was 66.4 L/hr. After oral administration of a single 300 mg dose of 14C-labelled 
fostemsavir in a human mass balance study, 51% and 33% of the radioactivity was retrieved in the 
urine and faeces, respectively. Based on limited bile collection in this study (3 to 8 hours post dose), 
biliary clearance accounted for 5% of the radioactive dose, suggesting that a fraction of the faecal 
excretion is from biliary excretion.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Following single and repeat administration of fostemsavir ER tablets, increases in plasma temsavir 
exposure (Cmax and AUC) appeared dose proportional, or slightly greater than dose proportional, in 
HIV-1 infected subjects. 
Special patient populations 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of temsavir have not been evaluated in children and adolescents younger than 
18 years. 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of temsavir using data in HIV-1 infected adults showed that there 
was no clinically relevant effect of age on temsavir exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic data for temsavir in subjects greater than 65 years old are limited. Elderly patients 
may be more susceptible to drug-induced QT interval prolongation (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment on the exposure of temsavir after a single 600 mg dose of fostemsavir 
was evaluated in an open-label study in 30 adult subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate, 
and severe renal impairment, and subjects with ESRD on haemodialysis (n=6 per group). Based on 
creatinine clearance (CLcr), as follows: 60 ≤ CLcr ≤89 (mild), 30 ≤ CLcr <60 (moderate), CLcr <30 
(severe, and ESRD on haemodialysis) mL/min, there was no clinically relevant effect of renal 
impairment on pharmacokinetic exposure parameters (Cmax and AUCs) of temsavir (total and 
unbound). The mean fraction unbound (fu) TMR for the severe renal impairment group was 
approximately 58% higher compared with the normal renal function group. The regression model-
predicted average increases in plasma TMR (unbound fraction) Cmax and AUC were ≤15% and for 
AUC ≤30% for the mild, moderate, and severe RI groups. Cmax (bound and unbound) was lower than 
the Cmax threshold of an approximate 4.2-fold increase (7500 ng/ml) established based on temsavir 
exposure-response. Temsavir was not readily cleared by haemodialysis, with approximately 12.3% of 
the administered dose removed during the 4-hour haemodialysis session. Haemodialysis initiated 4 
23 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
hours after temsavir dosing was associated with an average 46% increase in plasma total temsavir Cmax 
and an average 11% decrease in AUC relative to pharmacokinetics off haemodialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of temsavir after a single 600 mg dose of 
fostemsavir was evaluated in an open-label study in 30 adult subjects with normal (n=12), mild (Child-
Pugh Score A, n=6), moderate (Child-Pugh Score B, n=6), and severe (Child-Pugh Score C, n=6) 
hepatic impairment. In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment, the increased exposure to both 
unbound and total Cmax and AUC was in the range of 1.2- to 2.2-fold. However, the upper bounds of 
the 2-sided 90% CI for the impact of hepatic impairment on plasma total and unbound temsavir Cmax 
are lower than the Cmax threshold of an approximate 4.2-fold increase (7500 ng/ml) established based 
on temsavir exposure-response (see section 5.1- Effects on electrocardiogram). 
Gender 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated no clinically relevant effect of gender on the exposure 
of temsavir. Of the 764 subjects included in the analysis, 216 (28%) were female. 
Race 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated no clinically relevant effect of race on the exposure of 
temsavir.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis 
Neither fostemsavir nor temsavir were mutagenic or clastogenic using in vitro tests in bacteria and 
cultured mammalian cells and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay. Fostemsavir was not carcinogenic in 
long term studies in the mouse and rat following oral gavage administration up to 26 and 100 weeks, 
respectively. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In rats, male fertility was not affected at TMR exposures up to 125 times the human exposure at the 
RHD despite testicular and epididymal toxicity. Female fertility and early pregnancy were also not 
adversely affected at exposures up to 186 times the human exposure at the RHD. While embryofetal 
exposure was demonstrated in a separate distribution study in pregnant rats with oral administration of 
14C-FTR, no effects on embryofetal development were noted in this species at exposures up to 200 
times the human exposure at the RHD. In rabbits embryofetal development was also not affected at 
exposures up to 30 times the human exposure at the RHD. Prenatal and postnatal development 
including the attainment of puberty and learning memory in offspring was not influenced in rats at 
exposures up to 50 times the human exposure at the RHD. At maternal exposures that are up to 130 
times the human AUC at the RHD, reduced postnatal viability probably due to an increased lactational 
exposure to TMR was noted in the offspring. TMR is present in the milk of lactating rats and in the 
blood of the rat pups exposed through lactation. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
Fostemsavir has been evaluated in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats (up to 26 weeks) and in dogs (up 
to 39 weeks). Cardiovascular telemetry studies indicated that both FTR and TMR minimally 
prolonged the QT interval in dogs (approximately 8 to 18 msec) at plasma concentrations of TMR >2x 
RHD Cmax. Principle findings were testicular toxicity (degeneration of seminiferous epithelium, 
decreases in sperm motility and sperm morphologic alterations), renal toxicity (decreases in urine pH, 
renal tubular dilatation, increase kidney weight and urine volume), adrenal toxicity (angiectasis, 
increased gland size and weight), and liver toxicity (hepatic canalicular bile pigment deposits and 
lipofuscin pigment deposits in Kupffer cells). These findings were observed in rats only (at systemic 
exposures ≥ 30 times the 600 mg twice daily human clinical exposure based on AUC), except liver 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
toxicity reported in dogs (at exposure multiples ≥ 3). The majority of these effects were duration-
dependent and reversible upon cessation of treatment.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rukobia is and what it is used for 
Rukobia contains fostemsavir and is a type of HIV medicine (anti-retroviral) known as an attachment 
inhibitor (AI). It works by attaching to the virus and then blocking it from entering your blood cells. 
Rukobia is used with other anti-retroviral medicines (combination therapy), to treat HIV infection in 
adults with limited treatment options (other anti-retroviral medicines are not sufficiently effective or 
are not suitable). 
Rukobia does not cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body and keeps it at a low 
level. Given HIV reduces the number of CD4 cells in your body, keeping HIV at a low level also 
increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that are important 
in helping your body fight infection. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Rukobia  
Do not take Rukobia  
• 
• 
if you are allergic to fostemsavir or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
Section 6) 
if you are taking any of these medicines: 
o  carbamazepine, or phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures (fits)) 
o  mitotane (to treat several types of cancer) 
o  enzalutamide (to treat prostate cancer) 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  rifampicin (to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis) 
o  medicines that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product for 
depression). 
  If you think any of these apply to you, do not take Rukobia until you have checked with your 
doctor. 
Warnings and precautions  
Conditions you need to look out for  
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. 
These include:  
•  infections and inflammation 
•  joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Rukobia.  
  See Section 4 of this leaflet. 
Before you take Rukobia your doctor needs to know 
• 
• 
if you have or had a heart problem, or if you notice any unusual changes in your heart beat 
(such as beating too fast or too slow). Rukobia can affect heart rhythm. 
if you have or had liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C.   
  Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. You may need extra check-ups, including blood tests, 
while you are taking your medicines. 
You will need regular blood tests 
For as long as you are taking Rukobia, your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to measure the 
amount of HIV in your blood, and to check for side effects. There is more information about these side 
effects in Section 4 of this leaflet. 
Stay in regular contact with your doctor 
Rukobia helps to control your condition, but it is not a cure for HIV infection. You need to keep taking 
it every day to stop your illness from getting worse. Because Rukobia does not cure HIV infection, 
you may still develop other infections and illnesses linked to HIV infection. 
  Keep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Rukobia without your doctor’s advice. 
Children and adolescents 
Rukobia is not recommended for people aged under 18 years because it has not been studied in this

your dose or that you need extra check-ups. 
Pregnancy  
If you are pregnant, or think you could be, or if you are planning to have a baby, do not take 
Rukobia without checking with your doctor. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefit and the 
risk to your baby of taking Rukobia while you’re pregnant. 
Breast-feeding 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk.  
It is not known whether the ingredients of Rukobia can pass into breast milk and harm your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor 
as soon as possible.

Rukobia can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. 
Do not drive or use machines unless you are sure you are not affected. 
3. 
How to take Rukobia

if you are not sure. 
•  The usual dose of Rukobia is one 600 mg tablet, twice a day. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Rukobia should be swallowed whole, with some liquid. Do not chew, crush or split the tablets 
— if you do, there is a danger the medicine may be released into your body too quickly.  
•  You can take Rukobia with or without food. 
If you take more Rukobia than you should  
If you take too many tablets of Rukobia contact your doctor or pharmacist. If possible, show them 
the Rukobia pack. 
If you forget to take Rukobia  
Take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and 
go back to your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. If you are 
not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you stop taking Rukobia 
Do not stop Rukobia without checking with your doctor.  
To control your HIV infection and to stop your illness getting worse, take Rukobia for as long as your 
doctor recommends. Do not stop unless your doctor asks you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everybody gets them, so it is very 
important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. 
Symptoms of infection and inflammation are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When they start treatment, the immune system 
becomes stronger, so the body starts to fight infections. 
Symptoms of infection and inflammation may develop, caused by either: 
•  old, hidden infections flaring up again as the body fights them  
•  the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorders). 
The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking medicine to 
treat your HIV infection.  
Symptoms may include: 
•  muscle weakness and/or pain 
•  joint pain or swelling 
•  weakness that starts in the hands and feet and moves up towards the trunk of the body 
•  palpitations or tremor 
•  excessive restlessness and movement (hyperactivity). 
If you get any symptoms of infection and inflammation or if you notice any of the symptoms 
above: 
  Tell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without 
checking with your doctor. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
feeling sick (nausea) 
diarrhoea 
being sick (vomiting) 
stomach pain (abdominal pain) 
headache 
rash. 
  Talk to your doctor if you get any side effects. 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  
• 
• 
• 
indigestion (dyspepsia) 
lack of energy (fatigue) 
disturbance in heart rhythm seen in ECG test (prolonged QT interval) 
•  muscle pain (myalgia) 
• 
• 
• 
feeling drowsy (somnolence) 
dizziness 
taste disturbance (dysgeusia) 
•  wind 
• 
• 
difficulty sleeping (insomnia) 
itching (pruritus). 
  Talk to your doctor if you get any side effects. 
Some side effects may only be seen in your blood tests and may not appear immediately after you start 
taking Rukobia.  
Common side effects that may show up in blood tests are: 
• 
• 
• 
increase in enzymes produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase, an indicator of 
muscle damage)  
increase in creatinine, an indicator of how well your kidneys are working 
increase in enzymes produced in the liver (transaminases, an indicator of liver damage). 
Other side effects that may show up in blood tests  
Other side effects have occurred in some people but their exact frequency is unknown:  
• 
increase in bilirubin (a substance produced by the liver) in the blood. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: 
•  if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
•  if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
•  if they drink alcohol 
•  if their immune systems are very weak 
•  if they are overweight. 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
•  stiffness in the joints 
•  aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
•  difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: 
→ Tell your doctor. 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety

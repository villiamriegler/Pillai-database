1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

pharmacovigilance database of all solicited and 
unsolicited cases of intestinal obstruction reported 
with colesevelam as a suspect drug, the safety signal 
on intestinal obstruction was identified and a change 
to the product information was considered necessary. 
Therefore section 4.8 of the SmPC and section 4 of the 
package leaflet for colesevelam have been updated to 
include intestinal obstruction as an adverse reaction.

concluded that colesevelam affects the 
and PL 
pharmacokinetics of olmesartan, metformin, 
glimepiride and glipizide when taken concomitantly. 
Co-administration of colesevelam and metformin 
extended release (ER) tablets increases the exposure 
of metformin. Colesevelam binds to glimepiride and 
reduces glimepiride absorption from the 
gastrointestinal tract. No interaction was observed 
when glimepiride was taken at least 4 hours before 
colesevelam. Co-administration of colesevelam and 
glipizide decreases the exposure of glipizide. In this 
group of variations the product information for 
colesevelam has been updated in order to include this 
safety information.

distension, dysphagia and pancreatitis. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the

Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
QRD template version 8.0.

MAH 
#12 for Cholestagel, the MAH updated the SmPC to 
include abdominal distension. Furthermore, based on 
the provided cumulative overview of cases of 
pancreatitis and dysphagia, additional update of 
section 4.8 was agreed. The package leaflet was 
amended accordingly. The PI was also updated to 
bring it in line with the QRD template 8.0 and to 
include updated information on local representatives.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
18/02/2010 
23/03/2010 
SmPC and PL 
The CHMP agreed to the proposed amendments to 
Package Leaflet.  
This type II variation concerns an update of sections 4.2 
and 4.5 of the SmPC, upon request by the CHMP 
following the assessment of PSUR 10, to add information 
on the posology of Cholestagel in relation to co-
administered drugs in general and ursodeoxycholic acid 
in particular. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add information 
on the timing of Cholestagel intake at least four hours 
before or after concomitantly administered 
medication. With respect to the interaction with 
ursodeoxycholic acid, the SmPC was amended with a 
statement to take Cholestagel at least four hours after 
the intake of concomitant medicinal products. 
When a drug interaction cannot be excluded with a 
concomitant medicinal product for which minor 
variations in the therapeutic level would be clinically 
important, Cholestagel should be administered at least 
four hours before or at least four hours after the 
concomitant medication in order to minimize the risk 
of reduced absorption of the concomitant medication 
(see section 4.5).  
Cholestagel may affect the bioavailability of other 
medicinal products. Therefore when a drug interaction 
cannot be excluded with a concomitant medicinal 
product for which minor variations in the therapeutic 
level would be clinically important, Cholestagel should 
be administered at least four hours before or at least 
four hours after the concomitant medication to 
minimize the risk of reduced absorption of the 
concomitant medication. For concomitant medications 
Cholestagel 
Page 6/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which require administration via divided doses, it 
should be noted that the required dose of Cholestagel 
can be taken once a day. 
Ursodeoxycholic acid 
Cholestagel predominantly binds hydrophobic bile 
acids. In a clinical study Cholestagel did not affect the 
faecal excretion of endogenous (hydrophilic) 
ursodeoxycholic acid. However, formal interaction 
studies with ursodeoxycholic acid have not been 
performed. As noted in general, when a drug 
interaction cannot be excluded with a concomitant 
medicinal product, Cholestagel should be administered 
at least fours hour before or at least four hours after 
the concomitant medication to minimise the risk of 
reduced absorption of the concomitant medication.

ezetimibe, and the addition of Cholestagel as 
combination therapy with ezetimibe in patients with 
primary hypercholesterolaemia whom a statin is 
considered inappropriate or is not well-tolerated.  
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC have been updated. In addition, sections 4.2 and 
5.1 were updated to include the information on the 
results of the clinical study conducted with children.  
Further, the MAH proposed to update section 4.5 of the 
SmPC with the information on the effect of Cholestagel

on the bioavailability of lovastatin. 
The Package Leaflet has been amended accordingly. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to make some minor 
editorial changes to the annexes and to update the 
contact details of several local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet. In addition, the MAH has updated 
Annex II to include the version number of the latest Risk 
Management Plan (version 1.0) agreed with the CHMP.

recommendations. Based on new clinical data from a 
healthy volunteer interaction study of Cholestagel with 
ciclosporin, the main updated information in Section 
4.5 of the SPC reads as follows: "Based on theoretical 
grounds Cholestagel should be administered at least 4 
hours after ciclosporin intake". 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

The CHMP agreed to update information in the SPC for 
the combination cholestagel with fenofibrate. 
However, it was not considered acceptable to update 
the SPC section 5.1 based on results from the 
combination with ezetimibe. The applicant was asked 
to reconsider this when results from the ongoing 
TRIPLE study become available.

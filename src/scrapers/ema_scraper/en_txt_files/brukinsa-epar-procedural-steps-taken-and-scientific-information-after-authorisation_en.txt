1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

received at least two prior systemic treatments for 
BRUKINSA; based on results from studies BGB-3111-
212 and BGB-3111-GA101-001. BGB-3111-212 is an 
ongoing international, Phase 2, open-label, 
randomized (2:1), active control study of 
zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab (Arm A) versus 
obinutuzumab monotherapy (Arm B) in patients with 
R/R FL. The primary efficacy endpoint is overall 
response rate (ORR); while BGB-3111-GA101-001 is 
a Phase 1b Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability and 
Antitumor Activity of the Combination of BGB-3111 
with Obinutuzumab in Subjects with B-Cell Lymphoid 
Malignancies. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, 
4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 5.0 of the 
RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to implement editorial changes 
to the SmPC.

SmPC 
The SmPC is revised based on the results from the final 
efficacy information based on final efficacy results of 
‘progression-free survival’ (PFS) analysis from study 
BGB-3111-305; this is a Phase III, randomized study 
of Zanubrutinib compared with Ibrutinib in patients 
with Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to align the wording 
with the approved Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
study report from study 305 – at 205 PFS events at an 
additional 7 months since the final analysis for ORR. As of 
the data cutoff date (08 August 2022), the median PFS 
follow-up time was 31.4 months in the zanubrutinib arm 
and 27.8 months in the ibrutinib arm by investigator, and 
32.9 months in the zanubrutinib arm and 28.1 months in 
the ibrutinib arm by IRC. Updated ORR data were also 
presented as the final ORR analysis had been performed 
with a DCO on Dec. 1, 2021:  ORR assessed by investigator 
were 83.5% (95% CI, 79.0, 87.3) for the zanubrutinib arm 
and 74.2% (95% CI, 69.0, 78.8) for the ibrutinib arm; ORR 
assessed by ICR were 86.2% (95% CI, 82.0, 89.8) for the 
zanubrutinib arm and 75.7 % (95% CI, 70.7, 80.3) for the 
ibrutinib arm.

113 - A Drug-Drug Interaction Study of Zanubrutinib 
with Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors in 
Patients With B-Cell Malignancies, listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP. 
The RMP version 3.0 has also been submitted. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
The paragraph on Strong CYP3A inhibitors under section 
4.5 was amended to reflect that the coadministration of 
multiple doses of itraconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) in 
healthy volunteers increased the Cmax of zanubrutinib by 
2.6-fold and AUC by 3.8-fold . The coadministration of 
multiple doses of strong CYP3A inhibitors voriconazole and 
clarithromycin in patients with B-cell malignancies resulted 
in increased zanubrutinib exposures by 3.30-fold and 1.92-
fold for dose-normalized AUC0-24h and 3.29-fold and 2.01-
fold for dose-normalized Cmax, respectively. 
Further, in relation to moderate CYP3A inhibitors it was 
revised to state that he coadministration of multiple doses

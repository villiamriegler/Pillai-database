2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH is submitting as part of this application two type II variations (Category C.l.2.b) to apply for 
Benepali to be registered for two paediatric indications already approved for the reference product Enbrel: 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Paediatric plaque psoriasis.  
The MAH proposes to group the two submitted variations since the variation type and justification for 
claiming for extrapolation of both indications are the same. Adding to that, the mechanism of action of 
etanercept regarding the proposed indications (JIA and paediatric psoriasis) is TNF-a binding, which 
shares the same mechanism as to the approved indications of Benepali such as RA and psoriasis.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Biosimilarity has been demonstrated on non-clinical level with the initial marketing authorisation of 
Benepali. Extrapolation of these data to the newly applied indications is considered adequate to support 
this application from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
This application is considered acceptable from a non-clinical perspective.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic data was submitted. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic data was submitted. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic equivalence, between the biosimilar product and innovator was demonstrated at the 
time of the initial MA. This data can be extrapolated from adult studies to the paediatric target population 
regarding the applied two new indications for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and paediatric 
plaque psoriasis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/25469/2017 
Page 5/18 
 
  
  
 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Comparative Pharmacokinetics of Benepali to the reference product in healthy volunteers was 
demonstrated with the initial MAA, supported by pharmacokinetic measurements in a subset of RA 
patients.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
No new clinical studies were submitted. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The newly applied indications are already approved for the reference product Enbrel. 
This application relies on the data submitted for the reference product Enbrel in the proposed indications. 
According to the EMA guideline on “Similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived 
proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues”, extrapolation from one disease model to 
other indications may be accepted based on the totality of the data i.e. quality, non-clinical and clinical 
evidence.  
Biosimilarity to Enbrel has already been demonstrated at the time of the initial MA. 
Sufficient knowledge of pharmacodynamics properties of Enbrel, including binding to its target receptor(s) 
and intrinsic activity demonstrate the same mechanism of action across all the indications.  
Therefore safety and efficacy results from the studies presented at the initial MAA are sufficient for 
extrapolation to the applied paediatric indications, already approved for the references product. 
Dosing in both pediatric indications is based on body weight. As Benepali, in contrast to Enbrel, is only 
available as a 50 mg single dose, the presentation is applicable only for pediatric patients with body 
weight equal or greater than 62.5 kg. A wording has been included in the PI, in section 4.2, stating that 
other etanercept products are available for pediatric patients that require less than a full 50 mg dose. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
This application is considered acceptable from a clinical point of view. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
No new safety data was submitted. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety issues for TNF-α inhibitors, including etanercept, are related with their 
immunosuppressive action. Long-term inhibition of TNF-α could lead to a serious impairment of defence 
mechanisms against infections (in particular opportunistic infections) and against the development of 
neoplasms. 
With the initial marketing authorisation, safety / tolerability of Benepali has been compared against the 
safety / tolerability profile of Enbrel: Key safety information is derived from the clinical Phase III study 
SB4-G31-RA in RA patients as an appropriate study population for showing biosimilarity, supported by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/25469/2017 
Page 6/18 
 
  
  
clinical Phase I study SB4-G11-NHV in healthy subjects. Overall, there was no apparent and meaningful 
difference in safety and tolerability in the clinical studies. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
This application is considered acceptable from a safety point of view. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.2 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4.2 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of the new indications in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in paediatric plaque psoriasis, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. Annex II, the Package Leaflet 
and Labelling are updated in accordance.  
Dosing in both pediatric indications is based on body weight. As Benepali, in contrast to Enbrel, is only 
available as a 50 mg single dose, the presentation is applicable only for pediatric patients with body 
weight equal or greater than 62.5 kg. A wording has been included in the PI, in section 4.2, stating that 
other etanercept products are available for pediatric patients that require less than a full 50 mg dose. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
This application concerns an extension of indication to include two new indications for the treatment of 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis and paediatric plaque psoriasis, already approved for the reference medicinal 
product (Enbrel) for Benepali.  
The reference medicinal product may have more than one therapeutic indication. When biosimilar 
Assessment report  
EMA/25469/2017 
Page 15/18 
 
  
  
 
comparability has been demonstrated in one indication, extrapolation of clinical data to other indications 
of the reference product is possible. Extrapolation should be considered in the light of the totality of data, 
i.e. quality, non-clinical and clinical data. It is expected that the safety and efficacy can be extrapolated 
when biosimilar comparability has been demonstrated by thorough physico-chemical and structural 
analyses as well as by in vitro functional tests complemented with clinical data (efficacy and safety and/or 
PK/PD data) in one therapeutic indication. 
No new clinical studies were submitted in this application. Biosimilarity of Benepali to Enbrel has been 
demonstrated on physiochemical, biological, non-clinical and clinical grounds with the initial marketing 
authorisation in January 2016. Knowledge of pharmacodynamic properties of Enbrel, including binding to 
its target receptor(s) and intrinsic activity demonstrate the same mechanism of action across all the 
indications.  
Results from the data presented at the initial MAA are sufficient for extrapolation to the applied paediatric 
indications, already approved for the references product.  
The benefit-risk balance for the newly proposed indications of Benepali is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

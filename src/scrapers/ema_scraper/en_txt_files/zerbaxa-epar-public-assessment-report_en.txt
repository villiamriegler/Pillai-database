2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Complicated UTI (cUTI) constitutes a heterogeneous clinical entity that includes UTI in the presence of 
factors that predispose to persistent or relapsing infection, such as indwelling catheters, urinary 
obstruction, instrumentation of the urinary tract, or other functional or anatomical abnormalities of the 
urogenital tract, and may occur in the lower or upper urinary tract. Pyelonephritis, a subset of cUTI, is 
an infection of one or both kidneys that can occur in patients with or without functional or anatomic 
abnormalities of the urinary tract. Complicated UTIs are a frequent cause of hospitalisation and a 
common health-care associated complication. Gram-negative organisms account for approximately 
60% to 80% of complicated and nosocomial UTIs; the most common uropathogens are E. coli, 
Klebsiella spp, Pseudomonas spp, Proteus spp, Enterobacter spp, and Citrobacter spp.  
Successful treatment of cUTIs has become increasingly more challenging because of rising rates of 
antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens. Indeed, the majority of pathogens responsible for 
healthcare-associated cUTIs, including catheter-related infections, are now commonly resistant to 
multiple antimicrobial agents highlighting the need for development of new antibacterial agents. 
Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) include a wide spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from 
uncomplicated appendicitis to fecal peritonitis. In complicated IAI (cIAI) the infection progresses 
beyond a singularly affected organ and causes either localized peritonitis (intra-abdominal abscesses) 
or diffuse peritonitis. This peritoneal contamination may result from spontaneous perforation (e.g. 
appendicitis, perforated ulcer or diverticulitis), surgical intervention, or trauma. 
Effective management of these infections requires a combination of early diagnosis, appropriate 
surgical intervention, and empiric, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Overall mortality rates in 
cIAIs remain as high as 25% with subjects who develop tertiary peritonitis experiencing even greater 
rates of mortality. Complicated IAIs are common infections encountered in general surgery and have 
been estimated to be responsible for 20% of all severe sepsis episodes in the intensive care unit. The 
severity of the underlying disease and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, due in part to increased 
antimicrobial resistance, significantly contributes to the mortality rate observed in cIAIs.   
Pathogens most commonly encountered in cIAI are Escherichia coli, other common Enterobacteriaceae 
(e.g. Proteus, Klebsiella spp.), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis. Second or third 
generation cephalosporins in combination with metronidazole, extended-spectrum penicillin/beta (β)-
lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) and carbapenems are commonly used for the treatment of cIAI. However, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 8/101 
 
 
 
 
 
increasing resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents is a recognised serious global 
problem. Indeed, susceptibility data from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends 
(SMART) indicate that 18% of E. coli collected worldwide expressed extended spectrum beta-
lactamases (ESBLs) from 2005 to 2007, while the number of ESBL-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae 
significantly increased from 13.3% in 2002 to 30.9% in 2007. In addition, P. aeruginosa resistance in 
cIAI remains a problem.  
About the product 
Ceftolozane is a semisynthetic, parenteral antibiotic of the cephalosporin class. Ceftolozane as the 
sulfate has a molecular formula of C23H31N12O8S2+•HSO4- and the molecular weight is 764.77 g/mol. 
Like other members of the cephalosporin class, ceftolozane exerts its bactericidal activity by inhibiting 
essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), resulting in inhibition of cell wall synthesis and subsequent 
cell death.  
Tazobactam acid is a penicillanic acid sulfone derivative which can inhibit many bacterial class A - and 
some class C - β-lactamases. Tazobactam can potentially protect ceftolozane from hydrolysis by some 
beta-lactamases, broadening its spectrum to include most ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae and 
other Enterobacteriaceae.  
 Final indications: 
Zerbaxa is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults (see section 5.1): 
-  Complicated intra-abdominal infections (see section 4.4) 
-  Acute pyelonephritis; 
-  Complicated urinary tract infections (see section 4.4). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
(Acute pyelonephritis, although subset of cUTI, has been separated as indication, whilst data 
limitations for cUTI and cIAI are stated in section 4.4 SmPC) 
Proposed (final) posology: 
The recommended intravenous dose regimen for patients with creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min is 
shown by infection type in Table 1.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Ceftolozane 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance ceftolozane is (6R,7R)-3-[[3-amino-4-(2-aminoethyl- 
carbamoylamino)-2-methylpyrazol-1-ium-1yl]methyl]-7-[[(2Z)-2-(5-amino-1,2,3 -thiadiazol-3-yl)-2- 
(2-carbocypropan-2-yloxyimino)acetyl]amino]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic 
acid; hydrogen sulfate, corresponding to the molecular formula C23H31N12O8S2
relative molecular mass 764.77 g/mol. The active substance has the following structure: 
+.HSO4
-  and has a 
Figure 1
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by elemental analysis, UV, 1H- and 13C-NMR, 
IR, MS and XRD, all of which support the chemical structure. The water and sulfate ion content were 
evaluated using Karl Fisher and ion chromatography methods respectively. 
The absolute configuration of ceftolozane sulfate stereocentres at positions 6 and 7 and the geometry 
of the oxime moiety have been determined respectively to be in 6R, 7R configuration and the C=N of 
the oxime moiety in Z configuration. The 6R, 7R configuration and the Z configuration of C=N in the 
oxime moiety were evaluated and are controlled in the starting materials. 
Ceftolozane appears as a white to off white hygroscopic powder. The pKa values are 9.3, 3.2 and 1.9. 
The solubility in water at 25°C is 27 mg/ml, 35.0 mg/ml at pH 2.5 (0.05M sodium perchlorate) and 
32.3mg/ml at pH 4.0 (0.05M sodium perchlorate). A 2% aqueous solution has a pH of 1.9. 
The active substance is mostly amorphous, containing some degree of crystallinity. No changes in 
XPRD spectra were observed following storage at -20°C (18 months), 5°C (18 months), or 25°C (6 
months). The polymorphic form was not considered a critical attribute on the basis that the substance 
is dissolved during finished product manufacture. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ceftolozane sulfate is manufactured from 3 starting materials in 4 stages, which are comprised of a 
number of sub-stages. Two manufacturing sites are involved in the production of the active substance. 
The starting materials (SMs) are well characterised and are controlled by acceptable specifications. 
Sufficient information about their source and synthesis has been presented. A comprehensive 
discussion of the potential impurities that may be present in the starting material has been provided. 
Purging factors have been calculated and it has been demonstrated that the synthetic route 
downstream adequately purges any possible contaminants. The fate of Class 2 and Class 3 residual 
solvents has been satisfactorily discussed and where necessary they are appropriately controlled. A 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 11/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thorough discussion of potential GTIs in the described synthesis was also provided.  Given the controls 
applied to the synthesis of SMs, their purity, and the capability of the process to purge impurities, the 
proposed SMs are considered acceptable and in line with the principles of ICH Q11 and the EMA 
reflection paper on drug substance starting materials. No reworking is proposed for ceftolozane or any 
intermediates, however any material not meeting the acceptance criteria will be re-processed in line 
with ICH Q7A. 
The same synthetic route was used for the manufacture of active substance for all clinical trials, 
registration stability studies and non-clinical studies. However, additional development work was 
carried out using traditional single variable (one variable at a time) experiments and multivariate 
statistical (Design of Experiments) studies to optimize the process and controls for each stage of the 
synthesis. Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) have been determined for each sub-stage and suitable 
in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products and reagents have been presented. The characterisation of the active substance 
and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances.  
Ceftolozane sulfate is packaged in double polyamide / polyethylene bags heat sealed under vacuum, 
placed inside a four layered LDPE/nylon/aluminium/polyester outer bag and stored inside a carton box. 
The packaging material complies with EU Regulations 10/2011 and 202/2014. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), 
counter ion sulfate (IC), colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), optical rotation 
(polarimetry), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals 
(Ph. Eur.), isopropylic alcohol (GC), residual  trifluoroacetic acid (IC), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.) and 
bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). The tests for pH, clarity of solution, crystallinity, arsenic, and residual 
solvents other than isopropylic alcohol were omitted from the drug substance specifications. The 
control for pH was omitted on the basis that sulphuric acid content is controlled through the counter 
ion sulfate test. The clarity of solution and crystallinity are not considered CQAs. The test for arsenic 
was omitted because it is not used in the manufacturing process. The analytical methods used have 
been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information on the reference standards has been provided. The 
proposed specification and limits are acceptable. 
Batch analysis results for nine pilot scale and one commercial scale batches manufactured at the 
proposed site using the commercial process were presented. Supportive batch analysis data from nine 
development batches used in the manufacture of clinical, non-clinical, process development were also 
provided. The results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package  for 12 months under long term conditions at at -20 °C and 5 ±3 °C, and 
for six months under accelerated conditions at 25 °C / 60 % RH according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided.  
The following parameters were tested:  for appearance, colour of solution, water content, optical 
rotation, potency, assay, microbial limits, bacterial endotoxins, specified impurities, total impurities, 
purity and unspecified impurities.  The analytical procedures used were the proposed for release 
testing and were shown to be stability indicating.

Data were provided for up to 12 months at -20 °C, and 5 °C. All batches showed compliance with the 
specification at all time points and the statistical analysis of the data demonstrates no trending is 
expected. Data obtained at 25 °C / 65 %RH were not reported on the basis that the proposed storage 
condition was -20oC. This has been accepted considering the stability profile of the active substance. 
Forced degradation studies for ceftolozane sulfate was performed during method validation. Conditions 
of hydrolysis (acid, base), oxidation, heat, light and humidity were tested. The degradation pathways 
were presented. A hydrolysis product typically found in cephalosporin products is the main solution 
degradant. Degradation was more prominent under conditions of base hydrolysis. 
Based upon known photosensitivity of the ceftolozane the omission of photostability testing on the 
active substance was accepted. It is noted that the secondary container of the active substance 
includes an aluminium layer that protects the substance from light during storage at -20 °C.  
Based on the overall data and justifications the proposed retest period of 12 months under storage at -
20°C is acceptable.   
Tazobactam sodium 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance tazobactam sodium is sodium (2S,3S,5R)-3-methyl-7-oxy - 
3-(1H-1,2,3-trizol-1-ylmethyl)-4-thia-1-azabicyclo-[3.2.0] heptane-2-carboxylate-4,4-dioxide, 
corresponding to the molecular formula C10H11N4NaO5S  and has a relative molecular mass 322.28 
g/mol. The active substance has the following structure: 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by elemental analysis, IR, UV, 1H-NMR, 13C-
NMR, MS and thermal analysis, all of which support the chemical structure.  
Figure 2
Tazobactam sodium appears as a white to off white very hygroscopic powder. It is freely soluble in 
water and slightly soluble in ethanol and acetone. An aqueous solution has a pH of 5.0 to 7.0. The 
substance’s has a pKa of 2.6. 
The substance is manufactured as a single stereoisomer. The stereochemistry is determined by the 
stereochemistry of the starting material and a stereospecific reaction. Polymorphism was not observed. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tazobactam sodium is manufactured in 10 steps from well-defined starting materials. Detailed 
information on the manufacturing of the active substance and tazobactam acid has been provided in 
the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Tazobactam sodium is manufactured as a lyophilised sterile active substance. Tazobactam sodium is 
sterilised by filtration, lyophilisation, blending and aseptic filling into the proposed packaging. The 
sterilisation method was selected based on the heat sensitivity of the active substance. No catalysts

and no Class 1 solvents are used in the synthesis of the active substance tazobactam sodium. 
Reprocessing is not foreseen in the process. Acceptable specifications for starting materials 
intermediates and reagents were provided. The critical steps were identified as dissolution, filtration, 
loading, freezing, drying, end point of drying and yield, and sufficient in process controls are in place. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the relevant EU 
guidelines. The carry-over of impurities, including genotoxic impurities, and residual solvents has been 
satisfactorily evaluated. One of the impurities is a degradation product. The impurities formed during 
the synthesis of tazobactam acid have been adequately characterised, and their origin has been 
specified. 
The manufacturing process has been successfully validated using four consecutive commercial scale 
batches however the data provided.  
Tazobactam acid container closure system has been adequately described and a declaration of 
compliance with 2002/72/EC was provided.  
Tazobactam sodium is stored in aluminium tins, closed with aluminium caps and sealed with rubber 
rims. The tins are wrapped in double sterile polyethylene bags and placed inside cardboard boxes. 
Declaration of compliance with the relevant EU directives, including 2011/10/EEC has been provided. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), 
counter ion sodium (Ph. Eur.), colour and clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.), visible foreign and particulate 
matter (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual  solvents (GC), 
water content (KF), optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), 
sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). The analytical methods used have been 
adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information on the reference standards has been provided. The proposed 
specification and limits are acceptable. 
Batch analysis results for three commercial scale batches manufactured at the proposed site using the 
commercial process were presented. Analyses were done according to the proposed specifications and 
all data were compliant and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three consecutive commercial scale batches of the sterile active substance from the 
proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package  for 30 months under long term 
stability studies (25 °C/60% RH), and for six months under accelerated conditions at 40 °C/75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested:  appearance, IR spectrum, optical rotation, water, pH, clarity 
and colour of solution, related substances, assay, sterility, bacterial endotoxins and particulate matter. 
The analytical procedures used were the proposed for release testing and were shown to be stability 
indicating. 
All results were well within the specifications. No significant changes occurred under any of the two 
storage conditions at any time point. 
Forced degradation studies were performed in order to confirm the specificity of the HPLC method and 
to provide information about potential degradation pathways and degradation products. The results

showed that degradation increased under heating conditions, and less significantly during the light 
testing. After addition of acid and alkali, degradation is more prominent. At oxidative conditions 
degradation is less and slower.  
Based on the overall data and justifications the proposed retest period of 36 months with no special 
storage conditions is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Zerbaxa 1g/0.5g powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, is presented as a combination of two 
sterile powders in a single vial, intended for reconstitution and infusion.  
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to manufacture a suitable sterile formulation for infusion 
with a short re-constitution time, a physiologically relevant pH, sufficient potency, purity and stability. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was determined as an i.v. formulation able to provide a dose 
of 1000mg ceftolozane and 500 mg tazobactam, being stable and meeting the specification and the 
relevant Pharmacopoeia requirements. 
The product is manufactured by sequential aseptic filling of the ceftolozane, which is an intermediate 
product (DPI), and addition of sterile tazobactam sodium. The ceftolozane DPI consists of ceftolozane 
sulfate, and the excipients citric acid, sodium chloride and L-Arginine. 
Ceftolozane DPI physicochemical properties possibly relevant to the finished product critical quality 
attributes (CQA) and manufacturing are bulk untapped and tapped density, particle size distribution 
and hygroscopicity. The same physicochemical properties are relevant for tazobactam sodium bulk 
powder. The effect of DPI particle size and tazobactam sodium particle size on reconstitution time is 
minimal due to the high solubility of all components. Water content is controlled in the specification of 
tazobactam sodium. The effect of ceftolozane DPI hygroscopicity on the finished product water content 
was also evaluated. For the ceftolozane/tazobactam drug product, the manufacturing process controls 
mitigate the potential influence of these physicochemical properties on the CQAs. After filling of both 
powders into the vials, the vials are overlaid with nitrogen to provide a low-humidity, inert 
environment. 
It has been demonstrated that no changes in polymorphic form of ceftolozane occur throughout 
finished product manufacture or storage. 
The proposed potency adjustment of ceftolozane is acceptable. 
As a product intended for intravenous use, properties like particulate matter, sterility, endotoxin limit, 
pH, and osmolality are important for physiological compatibility. Particulate matter and 
sterility/endotoxin levels are controlled throughout the entire aseptic manufacturing process. The 
product pH is controlled to approximately pH 6 as IPC and at product release specification, in order to 
provide physiological comfort, and, at the same time, assuring adequate stability for the two 
substances. The tonicity of this product following reconstitution and dilution for infusion as per the 
SmPC (section 6.6) has been evaluated and is deemed acceptable for peripheral administration. 
The excipients and packaging components are well known and used in intravenous products. The 
compatibility of ceftolozane with the proposed excipients was evaluated and is supported by long term 
stability data. The compatibility of DPI and tazobactam sodium was established in long-term stability 
studies (36 month) for a blended product, made for Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015

Sodium chloride was selected as the sole stabilising agent, based on the lower total impurity level 
compared with other stabiliser tested. L-arginine showed also lower levels of impurities and a more 
stable pH compared with other alkalising agent and was therefore selected in the final formulation. 
Citric acid has been included in the formulation in order to control any degradation /sub-visible 
particulate formation due metal ions that may be introduced into the product from IV diluents. The 
choice of excipients has been adequately justified. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.  
The formulations used during the early clinical development were presented; the proposed commercial 
formulation is identical in composition to the clinical product. 
The finished drug product critical quality attributes (CQAs) are appearance, potency, identity, purity, 
moisture, reconstitution time, colour and clarity of solution, pH, content uniformity, particulate matter, 
sterility and endotoxins. The manufacturing process of the product consists of two main parts: i) the 
manufacture of ceftolozane DPI and ii) the aseptic filling of ceftolozane DPI and sterile tazobactam in 
vials. During the development of the manufacturing process a criticality assessment was conducted for 
the two manufacturing stages with regard to their direct impact on the product CQAs, based on 
knowledge of the ceftolozane sulfate and ceftolozane DPI properties, and prior knowledge. The CQAs 
that are affected by each one of the two main manufacturing stages were defined and the process 
parameters of each stage were further investigated through a series development studies. The 
different steps of the process were optimised and the studies resulted in establishing the critical 
process parameters for each step of the process as well as relevant holding times. 
The clinical phase III product was manufactured using a blend and fill process, whereas the proposed 
commercial process is a co-fill. This was assessed further and pharmaceutical equivalence of the phase 
III product and proposed commercial process was shown by the release data and stability data. 
The compatibility of the finished product with the diluents proposed for administration was evaluated 
using one batch of the finished product to assess the stability of the reconstitute and diluted product in 
the intravenous bag. The product was reconstituted in sterile water for injection or 0.9 % sodium 
chloride for injection and diluted in 0.9 % sodium chloride for infusion or 5% glucose solution for 
infusion. Data has been provided for the diluted product stored for up to 48 hours in ambient 
conditions or 14 days in a refrigerator. However it is noted that no analysis of microbial contamination 
was performed during the trials. Given the SmPC states that dilution should be performed in aseptic 
conditions and used immediately, it is considered that the compatibility and microbial data provided 
adequately support the proposed dilution and storage instructions (section 6.3). 
Zerbaxa 1g/0.5g powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, is packaged in a 20 ml type I clear 
glass vial, closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper sealed with an aluminium seal and plastic flip off 
cap. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The container closures system is 
appropriate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 2 main stages: the manufacture of ceftolozane DPI and the 
manufacture of ceftolozane/tazobactam finished product. The first stage comprises five steps: 
compounding, filtration, aseptic lyophilisation, aseptic grinding/sieving and, aseptic packaging. The 
second stage comprises six steps: aseptic filling, Aseptic stoppering, Crimping, visual inspection and 
sampling, labelling and, packaging.

The critical steps in the ceftolozane DPI manufacturing stage and in the final product manufacturing 
process were identified. Acceptance criteria for the critical manufacturing process parameters were 
specified.  
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and the particular 
pharmaceutical form. 
The proposed manufacturing process for the finished product includes steps is considered by to be 
non-standard process (aseptic processing, lyophilisation) as per the guideline on process validation.  
The manufacturing process has been validated using four consecutive commercial scale batches 
manufactured by the proposed. All the results met the release acceptance criteria. The manufacturing 
process has been satisfactorily validated. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf specification include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identity of both substances (UV, HPLC), constituted solution in water and in 
0.9% sodium chloride (Ph. Eur.), colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution time in water and in 0.9% 
sodium chloride, pH of reconstituted solution (pH-meter), water content (Ph. Eur.), potency of both 
substances (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), container closure integrity (vacuum), content 
uniformity (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins 
(Ph. Eur.). The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
have been appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Full details of the reference 
standards used were provided. The proposed specification, methods and limits are appropriate for this 
pharmaceutical form. 
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches manufactured by the proposed manufacturer 
have been presented. The batches were analysed according to the proposed finished product 
specifications and showed good compliance for all parameters. In addition batch analysis data for all 
batches of finished product manufactured for during clinical development and commercialisation have 
been presented. All results are well within the specifications valid at the time of testing. The results 
confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of four pilot scale primary registration batches of finished product batches stored under 
long term refrigerated conditions (5±3 °C) for 15 months and for 9 months under accelerated 
conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH were provided. One batch was also stored in the inverted position in long 
term and accelerated conditions. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The batches were 
analysed according to the proposed shelf life specifications for the following parameters: appearance, 
water content, pH, potency, purity, related substances, particulate matter, colour of solution, 
constituted solution/reconstitution time and container closure integrity. The analytical methods were 
shown to be stability indicating. The data for all parameters showed good compliance for all 
parameters. 
Additionally three batches of clinical trial material used in Phase 2 and Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials 
have been included as supportive data. The composition of these batches is identical to the proposed 
commercial product but they were manufactured by first blending the two sterile powders followed by 
CHMP assessment report

vial filling. The batches were placed on stability in long term (5 °C) and accelerated conditions (25°C / 
60% RH) and analysed according to the proposed specifications. All data showed good compliance in 
long term and accelerated conditions up to time 36 months in both storage conditions.  
Forced degradation studies were conducted with one pilot batch of the finished product, placed on 
stability in heat, humidity, basic, acidic, oxidative, and light stress conditions. The samples were 
evaluated for potency and impurities. The degradation observed in all conditions was consistent with 
the substances degradation pathways. 
A photostability study was conducted with one pilot batch, according to ICH Q1B. No significant change 
was observed for the samples packaged in their market packaging, however the unlabelled vials 
exhibited a significant increase in one impurity (out of specification), confirming the photosensitive 
nature of the proposed product. An instruction to store in the original container in order to protect from 
light has been included in the SmPC (section 6.4). 
Also based on the results of the compatibility studies (see above “Description of the product and 
pharmaceutical development”) the storage instruction regarding the reconstituted product in the SmPC 
(section 6.3) is justified. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 30 months when stored at 5±3°C in the original 
package in order to protect from light, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.4) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of both active substances and the finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. Tazobactam sodium is manufactured as a sterile 
active substance by a validated process. The finished non standard manufacture has been validated as 
per the relevant guideline. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GLP 
Pivotal studies for safety pharmacology, general toxicity including reproductive toxicity studies were 
conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) principles. Toxicokinetic (TK) and some 
pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were also conducted according to GLP and while some other studies were 
not strictly GLP. These studies appeared to conform to adequate scientific standards of quality 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A series of in-vitro and in-vivo studies were conducted to determine the antibacterial activity of 
ceftolozane /tazobactam. See the clinical section 2.4.3. on Pharmacodynamics for a brief summary. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Receptor/enzyme screens for ceftolozane at 766 μg/mL inhibited (by > 50%) binding to 16/130 
targets assessed in a serum free in-vitro binding assay. Specifically, ceftolozane inhibited binding to 
histamine H3 (56%), opioid delta 2 (51%), opioid kappa 1 (57%), opioid mu (89%), purinergic P2Y 
(59%), sigma 1 (52%), cholecystokinin CCK1 (96%), and neurokinin NPY1 (62%) receptors. 
Ceftolozane also inhibited the activity of phosphodiesterases PDE10A2 (50%), PDE2A (66%), PDE3B 
(61%), PDE4A1A (55%), PDE5A1 (57%), as well as protein kinases Akt1 (84%) and MEK1 (100%) and 
the histone deacetylase SIRTUIN1.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
A core battery of GLP compliant safety pharmacology studies, as well as several additional non-GLP 
studies, has been conducted with ceftolozane (developmental process). Toxicokinetic parameters were 
not measured in the safety pharmacology studies, but were extrapolated from exposure data in pivotal 
toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs.   
Receptor/enzyme screens for ceftolozane at 766 μg/mL inhibited (by > 50%) binding to 16/130 
targets assessed in a serum free in-vitro binding assay.  A concentration of 766 μg/mL is 
approximately 13-fold greater than the mean clinical ceftolozane Cmax (~57 μg/mL).  There were no 
effects in the hERG assay at concentrations of up to 1000 μM (~ 667 μg/mL), which is approximately 
11.7-fold the clinical Cmax. 
In a rat study in which animals were given IV doses of up to 1000 mg/kg, mean blood pressure 
transiently decreased by 8%, 11%, and 27% at 100, 320, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively. Heart rate 
decreased by 8%, 11%, and 22% at 100, 320, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively, at 1 minute post dose. 
In a telemetered dog study a rapid, transient increase in heart rate at 15 minutes post-dose was noted 
in one animal at 300 mg/kg; there was a 37% increase in heart rate vs. baseline. No statically 
significant effects on cardiovascular functioning were seen in rats or dogs following IV administration of 
ceftolozane at 100 mg/kg. The effects seen in these studies occurred at doses with estimated 
associated Cmax values of 728 to 2028 μg/mL for male rats and 793 μg/mL for male dogs, 
approximately 12.8- to 35.6-fold greater than the mean clinical Cmax. No ECG effects were noted at 
any dose. Given there were no effects seen on ECGs in this study and in the 4 week dog general 
CHMP assessment report

toxicology study and there are significant clinical data, the effects seen these safety pharmacology 
studies effects are unlikely to translate into the clinical setting.  
No renal safety pharmacology studies were conducted with ceftolozane or tazobactam either alone or 
in combination. The applicant states that a renal safety pharmacology study with ceftolozane was not 
conducted based on the lack of adverse effects noted in rats and dogs following repeat administration 
for up to 28 days. The presence of hyaline droplets in the tubular epithelial cells of the renal cortex of 
rats and dogs (and associated increases in kidney weights in rats) following repeat IV administration 
was considered non-adverse up to a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day.  
An independent, expert Pathology Working Group (PWG; comprised of four Board-certified pathologists 
with expertise in the evaluation of renal pathology) reviewed these renal changes in rats and dogs, to 
discuss the pathological interpretation of the studies, and provide expert guidance on the clinical 
relevance of these findings. The PWG concluded that the ceftolozane-related accumulation of hyaline 
droplets in the tubular epithelial cells of the renal cortex of rats and dogs was not adverse even up to a 
dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. This conclusion was based on the lack of toxicologically meaningful 
degeneration or necrosis present in affected renal tubules with no effects on renal function as 
determined by the absence of biologically relevant changes in BUN, creatinine, inorganic phosphorus or 
urine volume, as well as the absence of cellular/granular casts in the urine and clinical signs of 
systemic toxicity. In both the GLP 4-week rat and the dog studies with ceftolozane study and the 
combined 4-week rat study (ceftolozane or tazobactam), the NOAELs were set at 1000, 300 and 1000 
mg/kg/day, respectively, as a result of the findings of the PWG. However in the final study reports the 
NOAELs were set at 100, 100 and 250/125 mg/kg/day respectively.  
For the 4-week rat study (GLR050690) using the combined Cmax and AUC for both sexes at 100 
mg/kg/day at week 4 (208.4 μg/mL and 217.25 μg•h/mL, respectively) the margins of safety over the 
clinical dose would be 0.6 for AUC and 3.6 Cmax (cIAI) and 0.5 for AUC and 3.6 for Cmax (UTI). For 
the 4-week dog study (GLR050729) using the combined Cmax and AUC for both sexes at 100 
mg/kg/day at week 4 (258.1 μg/mL and 408.35 μg•h/mL, respectively) the margins of safety would be 
1.2 for AUC and 4.5 Cmax (cIAI) and 0.9 for AUC and 4.5 for Cmax (UTI). 
Given that hyaline droplets in the tubular epithelial cells of the renal cortex of rats and dogs were not 
shown to be associated with any other renal function/pathology findings and that even at the lower 
NOAELs stated in the final study reports suitable Cmax margins of exposure cover exist over the 
clinical Cmax and that the intended clinical dose of 1000 mg/500 mg per treatment for up to 14 days 
(i.e. short duration of dosing), the findings of these studies are unlikely to be a clinical safety concern. 
However the occurrence of hyaline droplets within the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidney 
represent lysosomes containing drug and membrane remnants, and so are considered a class-effect of 
cephalosporins. Clarification as to why the renal findings have not been included in the proposed SmPC 
is required.  
Renal safety pharmacology studies should have been conducted with the ceftolozane and tazobactam 
combination. However given the stage of development and data available from the general toxicology 
studies, generating this specific data at this stage would not provide any additional value to the risk 
assessment of the ceftolozane/tazobactam combination.   
In rats given single doses of 0, 68.9, 207, or 689 mg/kg by IV infusion, no neuropharmacological or 
toxicological signs (up to 24 hours post-dose) or effects on body temperature were seen at any dose. 
The 689 mg/kg dose had a projected mean Cmax 1397 μg/mL (i.e. 24.5-fold mean clinical Cmax).  
Ceftolozane solutions did not induce histamine release from human WBC in vitro at concentrations 
~52.6-fold clinical Cmax.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Following single and repeat-dose IV administration of ceftolozane to animals, pharmacokinetic analysis 
revealed t1/2 of 0.29 hour and 1 hour in rats and dogs, respectively, with rapid clearance and a 
relatively low Vd. Systemic exposure was dose proportional over a broad range of doses (10 to 1000 
mg/kg/day) with no significant accumulation following repeat administration or any gender-related 
differences. 
Three studies have been conducted in which the PK parameters of ceftolozane and tazobactam were 
determined following IV administration of each agent alone, or in combination at the 2:1 ratio 
proposed for clinical use. A single dose PK study was conducted in Beagle dogs. In addition, repeat-
dose toxicokinetic (TK) data were collected during 14-Day and 28-Day toxicology studies in dogs and 
rats, respectively. Overall, these studies demonstrated that systemic exposure to either ceftolozane or 
tazobactam was similar whether these drugs were administered alone or in combination, suggesting no 
significant PK drug-drug interaction between ceftolozane and tazobactam. In general, there were 
relatively dose-proportionate increases in systemic exposure to ceftolozane and tazobactam over the 
dose ranges assessed, suggesting that ceftolozane and tazobactam have linear kinetics when 
administered together. Both ceftolozane and tazobactam were eliminated rapidly with short t1/2 (< 1.1 
h) in both species.  
The in-vitro protein binding of ceftolozane in serum from mice, rats, dogs and humans as well as in 
human plasma was low. Ceftolozane showed < 21% serum protein binding across species with human 
serum protein binding values ranging from 14.6% to 16.8%, slightly lower than human plasma values 
(16.3% to 20.8%).  
The distribution of 14C-labeled ceftolozane in blood, plasma, and tissues was determined in rats. The 
t1/2 for 14C-labeled ceftolozane was 0.35 h in both plasma and blood. Five minutes after 
administration, the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio of radioactivity was found to be highest in the 
kidney and urinary bladder with tissue to blood ratios of 3.05 and 2.36, respectively. Concentrations of 
radioactivity were at a maximum 5 minutes after administration. Tissue concentrations in the brain and 
pituitary were below detection limits. A total of 13 metabolites were observed across plasma, urine, 
faeces, bile and kidney homogenates of rats administered IV 14C-ceftolozane. These metabolites were 
minor with each metabolite representing ≤5.1% of administered radioactivity and most accounting for 
approximately ≤1%. 
Given the high distribution of ceftolozane to the kidney, the presence of metabolites for ceftolozane 
was also analysed in the supernatants of rat kidney homogenates following IV administration of 14C-
labeled ceftolozane. Ceftolozane and four unidentified metabolites (MH-1, MH-2, MH-7 and MH-11) 
were detected in the kidney at 5 and 15 minutes after administration; however, these metabolites 
were not seen between 2 and 96 hours post dose. Overall, ceftolozane accounted for 82%, 84.7% and 
80% of the total radioactivity in the kidney at 2, 8 and 96 h post dose, while the four unidentified 
metabolites each accounted for 4.3% or less of the total radioactivity.  
These results demonstrate minimal metabolism of ceftolozane following IV administration with most of 
the intact compound being excreted rapidly in the urine. Based on the low levels of metabolites 
detected in the biological matrices assessed (<10%), the structures of the metabolites do not require 
identification.  
Thirteen P450 studies were conducted (inhibition and induction); 7 studies with ceftolozane, 4 studies 
with tazobactam and 2 studies with the tazobactam M1 metabolite. Ceftolozane, tazobactam, and 
tazobactam M1 demonstrated low potential for drug-drug interaction (DDIs) at clinically relevant 
concentrations in vitro. The applicant provided a satisfactory discussion of the drug-drug interaction in 
CHMP assessment report

vitro data in relation to the free unbound fraction. No potential to cause clinical DDIs involving the 
human transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, P-gp, BCRP and BSEP were noted in these 
studies. In addition no potential for ceftolozane to cause clinical DDIs involving the human MATE1, 
MATE2-K and MRP-2 transporters at clinically relevant blood concentrations was noted. Tazobactam 
inhibited the human OAT1 and OAT3 transporters in vitro with Ki values calculated at 117.7 and 146.7 
μg/mL (approximately 8 to 10-fold greater than the free plasma Cmax value of 15.4 μg/mL), 
respectively. Based on these in-vitro findings, a clinical study was conducted to evaluate the potential 
of tazobactam to influence the pharmacokinetics of the OAT1/OAT3 probe substrate furosemide, which 
showed no relevant interaction at the intended clinical dose.  
No PK drug-drug interactions were observed between ceftolozane and tazobactam following single or 
repeat IV administration to rats and dogs for up to 28 days. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In single dose toxicology studies, ceftolozane was associated with decreased body weight in mice 
following a single IV administration at ≥1500 mg/kg. Convulsions and mortalities were seen at 2000 
mg/kg. The effects noted at 2000 mg/kg were associated with estimated Cmax and AUC values of 6740 
μg/mL and 1710 μg•h/mL, respectively; approximately 118-fold greater than the mean clinical Cmax 
and 3.6 to 5.0-fold greater than the mean clinical AUC. No deaths occurred when ceftolozane was 
administered as a single IV dose to rats up to 2000 mg/kg. A transient decrease in body weight was 
observed at ≥1000 mg/kg, which was associated with estimated Cmax and AUC values of 1845 μg/mL 
and 1282 μg•h/mL, respectively; approximately 32-fold and 2.7 to 3.7-fold the clinical values.  
Vomiting was observed in dogs following a single IV administration of ceftolozane ≥300 mg/kg with 
flushing of auricles/oral mucosa seen at ≥500 mg/kg. Additional clinical signs observed at 2000 mg/kg 
included prone position, decreased spontaneous motility, swelling of the head, dark purplish coloration 
of the skin, increased glutamate pyruvate transaminase activity, and decreased serum calcium levels 
in males. These findings are consistent with a Cmax related, direct histamine-mediated mast cell 
activation reaction and an increase in plasma histamine levels was observed in dogs following a single 
IV administration of ceftolozane. The more severe effects noted in dogs at 2000 mg/kg were 
associated with estimated Cmax and AUC values approximately 100-fold and 20 to 28-fold greater than 
the clinical ceftolozane values. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicology studies were conducted in rats and dogs of up to 4 weeks in duration via the IV 
route of administration with either ceftolozane alone or ceftolozane in combination with tazobactam.  
Doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day ceftolozane were given to animals. In the combined studies 0/0, 
1000/0, 0/500, 100/50, 250/125, 1000/500 ceftolozane/tazobactam were given to rats and 0/0, 
300/0, 0/150, 100/50, or 300/150 ceftolozane/tazobactam were given to the dogs.  
In the pivotal GLP 4 week IV dog study (100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day) at 1000 mg/kg/day 
reversible decreases in red blood cell parameters, vomiting, flushing of the auricles/oral mucosa, 
swelling of the head, salivation, and lateral position (consistent with histamine related mast cell 
degranulation) effects were seen. The NOAEL for systemic toxicity was 300 mg/kg/day based on 
cephalosporin-induced histamine-related in-life signs. The clinical safety margins are considered to be 
adequate. These findings were not seen clinically.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015

Hyaline droplets (confirmed as secondary lysosomes by electron microscopy) were detected in 
proximal renal tubules of rats and dogs following once daily repeated IV administration of ceftolozane 
for 28 days at doses of 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day in both species. Corresponding increase in kidney 
weight was consistently observed at these doses in rats but not dogs. Rats appeared more sensitive to 
these effects than dogs, as did male rats compared to females. Hyaline droplets were detected in rats 
given ceftolozane at doses with lower systemic exposure (plasma AUC and Cmax values) compared to 
dogs. These effects were associated with a slight dose response relationship in both species with the 
degree of hyaline droplets increasing from minimal at 300 mg/kg/day to minimal to moderate at 1000 
mg/kg/day. In dogs, increasing the duration of IV administration of ceftolozane from 2 weeks to 4 
weeks appeared to result in an increase in the incidence and degree of hyaline droplets suggesting that 
this renal change may increase with duration of dosing.  
The hyaline droplets observed in proximal tubular cells in renal cortex in rats and dogs can be 
interpreted as the initial step towards the known dose related pathogeneses of renal accumulation, 
that, for some cephalosporins, eventually lead to degeneration of the renal tubular epithelium. For 
ceftolozane, however, no microscopic evidence of renal tubular degeneration or necrosis was detected 
and no relevant effect on renal function was noted as determined by biologically relevant changes in 
serum BUN, creatinine, inorganic phosphorus, or urine volume. Calculation of safety margins based on 
the highest dose level tested is therefore considered acceptable. A safety margin of approximately 10 
(based on AUC levels), together with supportive clinical data, is sufficient to address the safety 
concerns associated with this known cephalosporin class effect. 
Ceftolozane is not considered to have an immunotoxic potential, based on lack of consistent effects on 
lymph nodes or cells of the immune system in a popliteal lymph node assay in mice, and lack of toxic 
findings on the immune system in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. In early, non-GLP 
screening studies conducted with early ceftolozane lots, lymphoid follicular development were observed 
in mice and rats. These findings are, however, not considered ceftolozane related, but are most likely 
related to the presence of endotoxin in these early lots.  
Caecal effects (increased cecum weight in the presence or absence of dilatation) were detected in rats 
at doses of 100 to 1000 mg/kg/day. Increased cecum weights with or without caecal dilatation 
following administration of antibiotics to rodents has been previously described. This effect is caused 
by a change in the intestinal flora and is not considered to be toxicologically relevant to humans.  
No new effects or unexpected toxicities were observed when ceftolozane was administered in 
combination with tazobactam in a 2:1 ratio to rats compared to the individual agents. The findings 
observed with the combination were comparable to the individual agents with regard to both incidence 
and severity. 
Genotoxicity 
One in silico study, four screening genotoxicity studies, and eight pivotal GLP genotoxicity studies were 
conducted with ceftolozane either alone or in combination with tazobactam.  
Ceftolozane was negative for structural alerts of mutagenicity using DEREK and Leadscope in silico 
analyses. Ceftolozane was negative for genotoxicity in a bacterial mutagenicity assay, a mammalian 
chromosomal aberration assay, a mouse micronucleus assay, and an in vivo/in vitro rat liver UDS 
assay. Ceftolozane was marginally positive (with a questionable concentration response relationship) in 
a mouse lymphoma mammalian mutagenicity assay up to 500 μg/mL. As a follow-up strategy for the 
positive MLA in vitro, the applicant has provided a negative in vivo micronucleus test in mice at 
systemic exposure higher than expected exposures in patients at therapeutic doses.

Ceftolozane in combination with tazobactam at a 2:1 ratio did not induce gene mutations in mouse 
lymphoma cells, did not cause numerical chromosome aberrations in CHO cells, and was not associated 
with an increase in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of 
rats. Ceftolozane in combination with tazobactam was positive for structural chromosome aberrations 
in CHO cells at concentrations associated with cytotoxicity. The relevance of this finding is uncertain as 
each of the individual ceftolozane and tazobactam test articles were not clastogenic at similar 
concentrations. 
Ceftolozane and tazobactam are intended to be used for short term administration (i.e. less than 14 
days and for the treatment of life-threatening infections. Given that ceftolozane in combination with 
tazobactam at a 2:1 ratio did not induce gene mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and was not 
associated with an increase in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone 
marrow of rats, the weight of evidence suggests that the positive result obtained with ceftolozane in 
combination with tazobactam in the in vitro Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay 
(structural aberrations) is unlikely to impact clinical safety, especially as individually they were not 
positive when tested alone at similar concentrations in this assay.   
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with ceftolozane alone or in combination with tazobactam 
based on the intended short duration of therapy (<14 days), a lack of structural alerts for mutagenicity 
in Deductive Estimation of Risk from Existing Knowledge (DEREK) and Leadscope in silico analyses, a 
largely negative genotoxicity package (see above) and the lack of proliferative changes in any organ or 
tissue in general toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs for up to 28 days. In addition, both 
ceftolozane and tazobactam belong to classes of compounds (cephalosporin and BLI) that historically 
have lacked evidence of carcinogenic potential.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Ceftolozane did not affect fertility/reproductive performance or embryo/fetal development following 
repeat IV administration to rodents at doses up to 1000 to 2000 mg/kg/day, respectively. In a pre- 
and postnatal development study, ceftolozane administered to F0 rats from gestation day 6 to lactation 
day 20 was associated with a significant decrease in auditory startle response in post natal day (PND) 
60 rats at maternal doses of 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day (study number: CX.101.TX.012).  
The NOAEL for neurobehavioral effects was identified as 100 mg/kg/day. No effects on auditory startle 
response were observed on PND25 or PND53 in neonatal rats directly administered 
ceftolozane/tazobactam SC from PND4 through PND31. However, due to different time windows of 
exposure in the two studies, potential clinical relevance of the observed findings following exposure 
during late stage pregnancy in rats cannot be excluded. This is adequately reflected in SmPC. 
This combination is intended to be used in the controlled environment of a hospital for not more than 
14 days (i.e. short duration of dosing), thus the reproductive data suitably supports this application. 
No reproductive studies were conducted with ceftolozane in combination with tazobactam based on the 
results observed with the individual compounds.  
Local Tolerance  
Intravenous administration of ceftolozane to rodents was associated with injection site erythema and 
oedema at 300 to 2000 mg/kg/day. In general, the findings were very slight to slight.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 24/101 
 
 
 
 
 
No injection site findings were reported in dogs administered with IV ceftolozane. A rabbit dermal 
irritation study was so conducted in which animals were exposed to 0.5 g ceftolozane dermally for 4 
hours. Ceftolozane did not cause dermal irritation under the conditions of this study 
Other toxicity studies 
A phototoxicity toxicity study was conducted in Long Evans rats. Animals were given IV doses of 0, 
100, 300, 1000 mg/kg/day once daily for 4 days. Ceftolozane was not phototoxic at doses up to 1000 
mg/kg/day. 
Ceftolozane showed no potential to haemolyse human red blood cells in vitro at concentrations up to 
and including 50,000 μg/mL.  
The antigenicity of ceftolozane was assessed in a non-GLP study conducted in female BDF1 mice. Mice 
were sensitised with an IP injection of ceftolozane at 10 or 100 μg/animal mixed with aluminium (4 
g/animal). A second sensitisation was performed 21 days after the first sensitisation. This study 
revealed a negative passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) against all challenge antigens in all groups. A 
test for active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) and a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) was conducted 
in male Hartley guinea pigs using a skin reaction test with Ceftolozane.  Ceftolozane did not elicit 
positive skin reactions, suggesting that there was no antigenic potential related to delayed-type 
hypersensitivity.   ASA and PCA reactions were negative in animals sensitised with ceftolozane alone. 
Animals sensitised to test article plus Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA) evidenced positive ASA and 
PCA reactions, suggesting that the test article has antigenic potential related to immediate-type 
hypersensitivity under intense sensitising conditions. Hypersensitivity was not generally observed 
clinically (in clinical trials). These data suitability support this application. 
Related substances  
The manufacturing process material (that was used in most of the non-clinical studies) was modified to 
a more robust “commercial process”. This 28 day bridging toxicity study in rats was conducted with 
ceftolozane manufactured using the “development” and “commercial” processes to demonstrate 
comparability and qualify a new impurity generated as a result of the process change. No new 
toxicities were seen. Ceftolozane-related degradants/impurities P1 (CB-607,341), P2a (CB-607,365), 
P2b (CB-607,366), P2c (CB-607,256), P3 (CB-607,367), P4 (CB-607,368), P5 (CB-607, 255), P7 (CB-
604,629), and P9 (CB-604,235) can be considered qualified. Based on the current draft (Step 3) ICH 
M7 Guidance document, “Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in 
Pharmaceuticals to Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk”, no genotoxic impurities are present in drug 
substance or drug product above levels considered acceptable for the intended short-term (≤14 days) 
drug administration period for treatment of serious Gram-negative bacterial infections. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The logDow,7.4 value of Ceftolozane was below 4.5 (i.e. logDow,7.4 = -0.21). Therefore Ceftolozane 
was not identified as a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or a very persistent and very 
bioaccumulative (vPvB) substance. The Phase I PECSURFACEWATER of Ceftolozane (0.57 μg/L) exceeded 
the action limit of 0.01μg/L, triggering a Phase II environmental fate and effects assessment.  
The non-clinical data in mammalian species show a lack of toxicity in developmental and reproductive 
toxicity studies, and so Ceftolozane is not expected to affect reproduction of fish or lower organisms. 
For that reason, a standard Phase II fate and effects assessment was performed.  
The logDow,7.4 value of ceftolozane was below 3 (i.e. logDow,7.4 = -0.21) and there are no other 
alerts for bioaccumulation. Therefore, the risk for bioaccumulation was considered acceptable.

PEC/PNEC ratios did not exceed the relevant triggers, and the risk to the aquatic, sewage treatment 
plant and groundwater compartments was concluded to be low. The Koc (6.5 to 1804 L/kg) was 
<10,000 L/kg and it was concluded that exposure to the terrestrial compartment as a result of 
spreading of sludge on soil is low.  
Ceftolozane was not readily biodegradable; the results of a water-sediment study demonstrate that 
ceftolozane and/or its metabolites significantly shift to the sediment indicating potential exposure of 
this compartment. The PNEC derived from the subsequently performed sediment effect study exceeds 
the PECSEDIMENT indicating that this compartment is not endangered. As a result Tier B Terrestrial risk 
assessment studies were not conducted. It is agreed that these studies were not required and that is 
Ceftolozane is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics of ceftolozane alone, or in combination with tazobactam, were 
conducted in mice, rats and dogs following single and multiple iv doses.  
Ceftolozane demonstrated dose-proportional PK following single and once daily repeat iv dose 
administration. There were no consistent and significant gender differences noted.  Ceftolozane is 
rapidly distributed to tissues in rat, with highest levels detected in kidneys and urinary bladder. Upon 
repeated dosing, accumulation of ceftolozane in kidneys was observed across species.  Plasma protein 
binding and transfer into blood cells is low for ceftolozane.  Metabolism following iv administration is 
minimal, and excretion predominantly via the renal route.  
Tazobactam exhibited an approximate dose proportional increase in both Cmax and AUC following iv 
dose administration in combination with ceftolozane to rats and dogs. No consistent gender related 
differences were observed.  Tazobactam is widely distributed into tissues and body fluids including 
intestinal mucosa, gallbladder, lung, female reproductive tissues (uterus, ovary, and fallopian tube), 
interstitial fluid, and bile. Mean tissue concentrations are however lower than in plasma. Distribution 
into cerebrospinal fluid is low in subjects with non-inflamed meninges. Tazobactam crosses the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015

placenta in rats, but concentrations in the foetus are ≤ 10% of maternal plasma. Excretion in human 
milk has not been studied. Warnings have been included in section 4.6 of the proposed SmPC. 
Tazobactam exhibits low plasma protein binding and is metabolized to a single major metabolite, M1, 
which lacks pharmacologic activity. Elimination of both tazobactam and the M1 metabolite is known to 
occur primarily by renal excretion. 
Administration of ceftolozane and tazobactam in combination to rats and dogs did not alter the PK of 
either ceftolozane or tazobactam, as compared to the PK of each of the compounds when administered 
independently. 
The toxicological potential of ceftolozane, both alone and in combination with tazobactam, has been 
characterized in studies of single- and repeat-dose toxicity, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, 
reproduction toxicity (including juvenile toxicity), antigenicity and phototoxicity. Further, studies to 
qualify the proposed impurity specifications have been conducted.  
All pivotal studies with ceftolozane alone and in combination with tazobactam were conducted in 
accordance with GLP regulations.  All in vivo toxicity studies used the intended clinical route of 
administration (iv).  Although a 60-minute infusion three times daily is used clinically, all but one dog 
repeat-dose toxicity study (in dogs) used bolus administration once daily to assess the potential for 
Cmax-related effects, and to minimise stress-related findings. Further, once daily administration to 
animals provided daily exposures in excess of human exposure at the intended clinical dose. One study 
conducted in dogs used twice daily administration by 15-minute iv infusion.   No mortalities occurred 
when ceftolozane was administered as a single iv dose to rats or dogs up to 2000 mg/kg. A transient 
decrease in body weight was observed in rats at doses ≥1000 mg/kg. The more severe effects were 
noted in dogs at a dose of 2000 mg/kg, including vomiting, flushing of auricles/oral mucosa, swelling 
of the head, prone position, decreased spontaneous motility, and dark purplish coloration of the skin. 
The findings in dogs are consistent with a histamine-related mast cell degranulation effect, a known 
class-related effect of cephalosporins in dogs.  Tazobactam-related effects in male dogs following 
single iv administrations include haematuria, vomiting, tremors, dry nose, shaking while breathing, 
conjunctival injection, reddening of skin, submucosal red spots or ecchymosis in the bladder, and 
decreased food consumption.   
No new effects or unexpected toxicities were observed in animals when ceftolozane and tazobactam 
were co-administered for 2 to 4 weeks. Non-adverse, reversible changes evident in the kidney and 
liver were consistent with findings noted in studies with either compound alone.  
The genotoxic potential of ceftolozane was evaluated in a number of in vitro and in vivo studies, 
including in silico, Ames test, mammalian chromosomal aberration, mouse lymphoma mammalian cell 
gene mutation assay (MLA), CHO mammalian cell HPRT gene mutation, rodent micronucleus, and in 
vivo rat liver unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS). Tazobactam is a well-known substance devoid of a 
genotoxic potential. Ceftolozane was positive in the MLA in vitro when tested alone, and in the 
chromosomal aberration test in vitro when tested in combination with tazobactam.  In view of 
otherwise negative in vitro and in vivo data (negative in silico data from two different systems, 
negative Ames test, negative findings in subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies with ceftolozane alone 
and in combination with tazobactam) at adequate exposure levels, and provided that the extrapolated 
exposure data are considered acceptable, the positive findings in MLA with ceftolozane and in the 
chromosomal aberration test with ceftolozane/tazobactam are considered of low clinical relevance.  
No carcinogenicity studies with ceftolozane alone or in combination with tazobactam have been 
conducted, which is considered acceptable, in view of intended short duration of therapy.

Ceftolozane administered to rats during pregnancy and lactation was associated with a decrease in 
auditory startle response in postnatal day (PND) 60 male pups at maternal doses of 300 and 
1000 mg/kg/day. Peri/postnatal development was impaired (reduced pup weights, increase in 
stillbirths, increase in pup mortality) concurrent with maternal toxicity after intraperitoneal 
administration of tazobactam in the rat. 
Ceftolozane/ tazobactam is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies with 
ceftolozane/tazobactam have not been conducted. 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 11 phase I and II clinical studies with pharmacokinetic (PK) data are submitted, with a total 
of 410 subjects receiving ceftolozane, 291 subjects receiving tazobactam and 249 subjects receiving 
the combination of ceftolozane and tazobactam, including six studies in healthy subjects (CXA-101-
01, CXA-201-01, CXA-MD-11-07, CXA-ELF-10-03, CXA-QT-10-02, CXA-DDI-12-10), three 
studies in patients with various degrees of renal impairment (CXA-101-02, CXA-201-02, CXA-REN-
11-01), one study in patients with cUTI (CXA-101-03), and one study in patients with cIAI (CXA-
IAI-10-01). 
All studies used an infusion time of 60 minutes. The volumes infused were 100 mL but the 
concentrations of solute varied. Ceftolozane, tazobactam and tazobactam-M1 were assayed using 
HPLC-MS/MS methods. Laboratories used and the LLOQs varied over time but assays were 
appropriately validated.  
In CXA-MD-11-07, CXA-REN-11-01, CXA-ELF-10-03 and CXA-DDI-12-10 and in the Phase 2 IAI (and 
all the Phase 3 studies) the product was supplied in vials containing 1 g ceftolozane and tazobactam 
sodium equivalent to 0.5 g tazobactam free acid in a lyophilised powder. The formulation used in the 
remaining Phase 1 studies was slightly different but no difference in PK would be expected vs. the final 
version.

Single dose studies 
Ceftolozane doses ranged from 250-2000 mg and tazobactam doses ranged from 250-1000 mg. In 
study CXA-201-01 ceftolozane and tazobactam were administered separately and together to assess 
the effect of co-administration on PK. Ranges of observed PK parameters after single doses are shown 
below.

Multiple dose studies 
In CXA-201-01 1 g/0.5 g and 2 g/1g ceftolozane/tazobactam was administered q8h for 10 days. There 
was no accumulation observed for either substance. 
Tables 10 & 11 
There was an apparent dose-proportional increase in exposure with no substantial differences in 
clearance and volume of distribution for both actives after single and multiple doses. 
Co-administration of CXA and TAZ did not affect the PK of each other. The time courses of plasma 
concentrations for each of ceftolozane and tazobactam as well as the M-1 metabolite of tazobactam 
were similar to those when equivalent doses were given alone

Distribution & metabolism 
 
In-vitro studies indicated that human plasma protein binding of ceftolozane is low (~16 to 21%). 
The reported binding for tazobactam is approximately 30%.  
  Ceftolozane exhibited low partitioning to blood cells.   
 
 
The volume of distribution for ceftolozane ranged between ~12 and 17 L in multiple dose studies in 
healthy volunteers and was similar to that for tazobactam (~14 to 18L). 
In the final POPPK model Vc in healthy subjects and patients was from 11-18 L. For tazobactam, Vc 
in healthy subjects was approximately 14 L but was about 47% greater in Phase 2 IAI patients. 
CXA-ELF-10-03 investigated ELF penetration after 1 g/500 mg ceftolozane-tazobactam q8h and 
reported respective penetration ratios of 48% and 54%. The ELF concentrations of ceftolozane 
exceeded 8μg/mL for approximately 60% of the dosing interval. 
A mass balance study was not conducted. Human PK data suggested that ceftolozane does not 
undergo significant metabolism in vivo. 
Tazobactam is partially converted to the ring-open inactive M-1 metabolite. Steady state for M-1 
appears to be reached by day 4 and some modest accumulation occurs in plasma. Exposure to the M-1 
metabolite increased in an apparent dose-proportional manner and was generally <10% of that of 
tazobactam. 
Elimination 
The vast majority of ceftolozane was excreted in the urine in humans as unchanged parent drug. Renal 
CL of ceftolozane was highly correlated to CrCL and was similar to CL indicating that the systemic 
elimination of ceftolozane is primarily renal. Renal CL was similar GFR for the unbound fraction 
indicating that tubular secretion does not contribute to renal excretion of ceftolozane. In contrast, CLr 
of tazobactam exceeds GFR for the unbound fraction, indicating that tubular secretion contributes to 
the renal excretion of tazobactam. 
The elimination half-lives of each of ceftolozane and tazobactam were not affected by dose or duration 
of dosing when given alone or in combination. The plasma CL and CLr for each of ceftolozane and 
tazobactam increased with increasing CrCL regardless of co-administration. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In CXA-QT-10-02 intra-subject variability was <10% for ceftolozane and ~12% for tazobactam. In 
healthy subjects with normal CrCL inter-subject variability (CV%) was low for ceftolozane (generally < 
20% for AUC and Cmax) and tazobactam (< 25% for AUC and Cmax). Inter-subject variability for 
ceftolozane in patients with cUTI was similar to that in healthy subjects (CV% 18% for Cmax and 26% 
for AUC) but variability for both actives was higher in patients with cIAI, in particular for tazobactam.  
Time dependency 
Ceftolozane and tazobactam do not exhibit time-dependent PK. The inactive M-1 metabolite does show 
some accumulation in plasma during multiple dosing.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
 
In subjects with mild renal impairment (estimated CrCL ≥50 to ≤80 mL/min) the ceftolozane mean 
Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-∞ were 1.2- and 1.3-fold increased vs. controls and mean t1/2 values 
were similar at 3.2 h. Subjects with moderate impairment (estimated CrCL ≥30 to <50 mL/min) 
had ~2.5-fold higher plasma exposures and the t1/2 was ~2-fold longer.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 38/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In subjects with mild impairment the tazobactam mean Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-∞ were up to 
37% higher than for controls but mean t1/2 values were similar. In subjects with moderate renal 
impairment mean AUC0-last and AUC0-∞ were 2-fold higher and the mean t1/2 was 1.6-fold 
longer. Mean plasma CL decreased 2-fold and was 1.7-fold lower after normalisation by weight 
while mean CLr was 2-fold lower and mean urine recovery was slightly reduced (64% vs. 75%).  
There was little difference in the PK of metabolite M-1 in those with mild renal impairment vs. 
controls but those with moderate impairment had increased exposures associated with the 
decrease in tazobactam CL so that the AUCm/AUCp ratio was 2.6-fold higher vs. the control group. 
In subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) plasma concentrations of ceftolozane 
declined with a median t1/2 of 11.1 h and were quantifiable for > 48 h. Tazobactam declined with a 
median half-life of 2.5 h and was quantifiable in plasma for up to 12 h. CLr for both drugs was 
reduced.  
An analysis of PK data obtained from the start of the infusion to the end of dialysis to determine the 
contribution of HD to removal of the 3 analytes showed that concentrations of each analyte declined 
rapidly following the start of dialysis with median t1/2 values < 2 h. More than 90% of the 
administered dose was removed by dialysis with concentrations just before the end of dialysis (Clast) 
that were 14-, 32- and 26-fold lower than the respective Cmax values. 
The POPPK analysis (CUBI-PCS-100) resulted in the following conclusions: 
 
 
 
There was no clinically meaningful difference in AUCss (<27% difference) between normal renal 
function and mild impairment in the absence of infection, suggesting no dose adjustment is 
needed.  
The GM dose-normalised Cmaxss and AUCss in moderate renal impairment without infection were 
about 2 to 3-fold those in normal renal function. This suggested a 2-fold dose reduction to 500 
mg/250 mg in moderate renal impairment.  
The GM dose-normalised Cmaxss and AUCss in severe renal impairment in the absence of infection 
were about 3 to 6-fold those in normal renal function. This suggested a 4-fold dose reduction to 
250 mg/125 mg in severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinical studies were conducted to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of ceftolozane. 
Ceftolozane does not appear to undergo hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion, and changes in PK are 
not expected in hepatic impairment. Tazobactam t½ increases by 18% in subjects with hepatic 
cirrhosis compared to that in healthy subjects and no dose adjustment is recommended in these 
patients. 
Elderly 
In the population PK analysis CUBI-PCS-100, 376 subjects of 18 to 86 years of age were included in 
the population PK analysis of ceftolozane and 249 subjects of 18 to 86 years of age were included in 
the population PK analysis of ceftolozane of tazobactam, or ceftolozane/tazobactam.  A small negative 
trend was observed between age and the clearance variability for both ceftolozane and tazobactam. 
However age were not identified alone to significantly influence the PK of ceftolozane/tazobactam. 
A breakdown of numbers of subjects/patients aged 65-74 years, 75-84 years and ≥ 85 years enrolled 
into PK, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies is shown below. A few subjects had no PK information due to 
withdrawal from study or incomplete sampling. PK sampling was not performed in the Phase 3 cUTI 
and cIAI studies.

Children 
No studies were conducted to examine the PK of ceftolozane/tazobactam in children. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The final POPPK analysis included data from 8 phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and subjects with 
renal impairment as well as data from the patients enrolled in Phase 2 studies in IAI and UTI. 
A total of 376 (212 males/164 females) subjects with 5048 measurable ceftolozane PK samples and 
243 (139 males/104 females) subjects with 2683 measurable tazobactam PK samples were included in 
the PPK analysis. Overall, 40% and 32% of subjects with ceftolozane and tazobactam measurable PK 
samples, respectively, were subjects with infection. Among the 73 subjects with UTI, 21 had 
pyelonephritis. Among the 77 subjects with IAI, 32 had appendicitis. 
The final PK model for ceftolozane was a 2-compartment disposition model with linear elimination 
including the effect of baseline CrCL on CL and body weight on Vc, and the effect of UTI and IAI 
infection on both CL and Vc. While body weight was statistically significant covariate for ceftolozane 
volume of distribution it did not influence exposure alone in a clinically meaningful manner. 
Ceftolozane CL is predicted to change by about 15% for a change of every 20% in CrCL and by about 
20% in subjects with UTI or IAI. The Vc would change by about 20% for a change of every 20% in 
body weight, except in subjects with cIAI. In the final model for ceftolozane the presence or absence of 
bacterial infection was an important component explaining the variability of CL and Vc. For a typical 
subject without any infection the estimate of t½β for ceftolozane was 3.07 h and for a population with 
bacterial infections the estimate of t½β was 3.00 h. 
The final PK model for tazobactam was a 2-compartment disposition model with linear elimination, 
including the effect of baseline CrCL on CL and IAI infection on Vc. CL is predicted to change by about 
14% for a change of every 20% in CrCL. The Vc is about 47% larger in patients with IAI as compared 
to healthy subjects.

Table 13 
Body weight was identified to be significant in Vc for the patients with cUTI but it did not impact drug 
clearance. Body weight might indirectly impact AUC through renal clearance which is a function of body 
weight but renal function is used to adjust the dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam.  
Therefore, there is no recommendation for dose adjustment based on body weight alone. This position 
was further supported by Monte Carlo simulations where >90% target attainment for ceftolozane was 
achieved in severely/morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥ 35) following the proposed dose adjustment 
based on renal function (based on the target of 1-log kill at 32.2% fT>MIC). 
None of other examined covariates (e.g. age, sex and race), were identified alone to significantly 
influence the PK of ceftolozane or tazobactam. 
While infection was an important covariate explaining the variability in CL and Vc for ceftolozane and 
Vc for tazobactam, its effect on PK was not considered clinically meaningful as any exposure changes 
were limited to less than 20%. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro  
  Ceftolozane did not demonstrate relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 (IC50 >300 μM) indicating low potential to cause clinically 
relevant inhibition of these CYP isoforms. Ceftolozane demonstrated no potential to cause time-
dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 at 
concentrations up to and including 6000 μg/mL. 
  Ceftolozane showed no potential to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 up to and including 1000 
μg/mL (nominal concentration), the highest concentration assessed in cultured cryopreserved 
human hepatocytes.  
  Ceftolozane is not a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. It showed no potential inhibitory interaction 
against OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 transporters at concentrations up to 500 
μg/mL. In a separate study there was no inhibition of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP or MRP2 at concentrations 
up to 2500 μg/mL. Ceftolozane demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of both MATE1 and 
MATE2-K transporters up to a concentration of 2500 μg/mL but there is a low potential for clinically 
relevant inhibition to occur. 
 
 
Tazobactam demonstrated no relevant potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 or CYP2D6. Tazobactam did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 based on catalytic 
activity and mRNA expression assays at up to 500 μg/mL. There was also no induction of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 at concentrations up to and including 1250 μg/mL. 
Tazobactam is a substrate for the OAT1 and OAT3 transporters, consistent with its known 
interaction with probenecid. It is not a substrate for P-gp, BCRP or OCT2 human transporters. 
Tazobactam demonstrated no potential to inhibit P-gp, BCRP or BSEP at up to 900 μg/mL (~58-
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015

fold unbound Cmax). Tazobactam inhibited OAT1 and OAT3 transporters with IC50 values of 
approximately 118 and 147 μg/mL, respectively. 
The M-1 metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or 
CYP3A4 at 150 μg/mL. There was no induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 at 75 μg/mL but 
there was a concentration-dependent decrease in mRNA levels and enzyme activity across all 
donors for all three isoforms tested.  
There was no inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, BSEP, BCRP or MDR1 
transporter function at 75 μg/mL. Inhibition of OAT1 occurred with an estimated IC50 >75 μg/mL, 
corresponding to ~50-fold mean Cmax and a low potential for clinically relevant inhibition. 
 
 
In vivo 
A clinical DDI study evaluated the ceftolozane/tazobactam drug interaction potential using CYP1A2, 
CYP3A4 and OAT1/OAT3 probe substrate drugs (caffeine, midazolam and furosemide, respectively). 
For the OAT1 and OAT3 substrate furosemide the decreases in AUC0-t and Cmax were ~12% and 17%, 
respectively.  
For the CYP1A2 substrate caffeine there was no appreciable effect of co-administration. For the 
caffeine metabolite 1,7-dimethylxanthine there was a 1.15-fold increase in mean AUC0-∞ and an 
increase in AUC0-t (29%) on co-administration. Both GMRs and 90% CIs exceeded 1.25. For the 
CYP3A4 substrate midazolam the mean Cmax was increased 1.15-fold and AUC0-∞ was increased 1.23. 
The 90% CI around the GMRs on Day 12 fell within 80, 125% but slightly exceeded 125% on Day 15. 
The applicant concluded that there was minimal potential for clinically relevant drug interactions as all 
GMRs were < 1.25 except for 1,7-dimethylxanthine.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The primary mechanism of action of ceftolozane is the same as for all other beta-lactam agents, i.e. 
inhibition of the transpeptidation step of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis by inactivation of PBPs. 
The spectrum of activity of ceftolozane includes enterobacteria, non-fermenters, fastidious Gram-
negative organisms, some streptococci and a few selected anaerobes. Ceftolozane alone is stable in 
the presence of those beta-lactamases that generally do not hydrolyse cephalosporins (such as TEM-1) 
but it is readily hydrolysed by a wide range of ESBLs and by AmpC enzymes produced by some genera, 
such as Enterobacter spp. However, it is relatively stable in the presence of pseudomonal AmpC 
enzymes, is not affected by loss of OprD and is a poor substrate for pseudomonal efflux pumps, 
making it a potentially useful agent for some MDR P. aeruginosa. 
Tazobactam has no useful direct antibacterial activity. It inhibits a range of chromosomal- and 
plasmid-mediated bacterial class A and class C β-lactamases. Tazobactam does not or does not reliably 
inhibit many beta-lactamases that are now emerging especially in association with MDR and PDR 
phenotypes, including (but not limited to) the enterobacterial plasmid-borne AmpC enzymes (CMY and 
FOX), KPC-2/3, OXA-types, PSE-like and VEB-5 enzymes or any metallo-enzymes. For susceptibility 
testing of the combination, MICs of ceftolozane were determined using broth microdilution in the 
presence of a fixed 4 μg/mL concentration of tazobactam, which was supposedly chosen to distinguish 
the enzymes that can and cannot be inhibited by tazobactam.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Large scale surveillance studies of ceftolozane and ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility were 
performed in N. America and the EU and included more than 33,000 contemporary (2008-2012) 
strains.  
  More than 99% of E. coli strains were inhibited by 8 μg/mL with MIC50/90 at 0.25/0.5 μg/mL 
overall and 0.5/4 µg/ml for strains with an ESBL phenotype. For non-ESBL-producing E. coli the 
highest MIC observed was 2 µg/ml.  
 
 
 
 
 
For K. pneumoniae with an ESBL phenotype the MIC90 was >32 μg/mL vs. 0.5 µg/ml for non-ESBL 
strains. 
For Enterobacter spp. the MIC90 was 0.5 µg/mL for ceftazidime-susceptible strains vs. 32 µg/mL 
for ceftazidime non-susceptible strains.  
The MIC90 was ≤1 μg/mL for Citrobacter koseri, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus 
vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Salmonella spp., Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. 
Upward shifts were observed for ESBL producers (e.g. for P. mirabilis MIC90 was 16 µg/mL). 
The MIC90 for Acinetobacter spp. and S. maltophilia was > 32 µg/mL while MIC90 values observed 
for H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and beta- haemolytic streptococci were 0.12, 4 and 0.5 µg/mL, 
respectively, based < 100 isolates of each. 
For P. aeruginosa in the EU a substantial proportion had MICs ≥16 μg/mL, mostly due to the 
presence of metallo-enzymes in Eastern European isolates. However, some produced serine-based 
enzymes that can hydrolyse ceftolozane and are not inhibited by tazobactam.   
Pharmacodynamic models 
In a mouse sepsis model, ceftolozane/tazobactam in a ratio of 2:1 was effective against ESBL-positive 
E. coli and K. pneumoniae and ceftolozane alone was effective against wild-type Enterobacteriaceae, S. 
pneumoniae and MDR P. aeruginosa. Of interest, while the MIC for ESBL positive and negative E coli 
was the same (0.25 μg/mL) the ceftolozane ED50 increased from 0.3 to 25.9 mg/kg. 
In further studies ceftolozane and ceftolozane/tazobactam were effective in systemic infection models 
including sepsis, pneumonia, UTI and infected burns in mice caused by P. aeruginosa (including MDR 
strains) and Enterobacteriaceae (including ESBL-producing strains). These studies identified the 
following targets for ceftolozane, noting that MICs did not per se affect the targets. It should also be 
noted that targets are for total and not free drug. However, protein binding estimates were taken into 
account in the Monte Carlo simulations use to estimate the probability of Target attainment (PTA).

For tazobactam %T>threshold was identified as the PK/PD parameter of importance. For example, 
analysis of the exposure-response in the mouse neutropenic thigh infection model and using E. coli and 
K. pneumoniae showed that a tazobactam threshold of 1 µg/mL correlated best with efficacy. 
In-vitro dose fractionation studies using E. coli producing different amounts of CTX-M-15 also clearly 
demonstrated the relationship between %T>threshold for tazobactam (see below). The tazobactam 
threshold was 0.05 μg/mL for strains with low or moderate expression of CTX-M-15 and 0.25 μg/mL 
for high expression. The time necessary for bacterial stasis at 24 h was 35% of the dosing interval 
regardless of enzyme production.   
Figure 6 
Further studies with different species and enzymes in the same model indicated that thresholds varied 
from 0.5 to 4 μg/mL tazobactam.

However, when the individual isolate ceftolozane MIC (with tazobactam 4 μg/mL) was transformed by 
a factor of 0.5, a unifying relationship for each bacterial genus was identified. This translational 
relationship allowed for the co-modelling of exposure-response ceftolozane/tazobactam relationships 
across isolates. The %T> threshold required for stasis, log 1 and 2 reduction was estimated at 65%, 
77% and 90% (these estimates were applicable to E. coli and K. pneumoniae with MICs up to 4 
µg/mL). 
Figure 7 
Data from this empirical relationship analysis are shown in the next table. The calculated tazobactam 
%T>threshold for stasis was similar for the clinical strains but higher than for the isogenic strains. The 
applicant states that this may reflect the presence of multiple β-lactamases and additional resistance 
determinants in the clinical isolates. It is also stated that the relevance of this empirical relationship 
should be studied using clinical outcome data with adequate sample size for higher MIC values.

Relationship between concentration and effect 
The proposed ceftolozane/tazobactam dose regimen for cUTI and IAI is 1g/0.5 g q8h using 1-h 
infusions. This regimen was selected based on PTA analyses using the targets described above and 
using Monte-Carlo simulations (MCS). 
MCS were conducted to determine PTA based on ceftolozane f%T>MIC targets for P. aeruginosa. PK 
profiles were simulated for 5,000 patients, with 1,000 in each of 5 renal function categories and 
adjusted doses, all using 1-h infusions, as follows: 
  High normal renal function (150 < to 200 mL/min): 1000/500 mg q8h  
  Normal renal function (90 to < 150 mL/min): 1000/500 mg q8h  
  Mild renal impairment (50 to < 90 mL/min): 1000/500 mg q8h  
  Moderate renal impairment (29 to 50 mL/min): 500/250 mg q8h  
  Severe renal impairment (15 to < 29 mL/min): 250/125 mg q8h  
Table 16 
The figure shows the results of simulations for those with normal renal function. At the 1-log kill target 
(blue line) the 1 g q8h ceftolozane dose is supported for strains with MICs up to 8 µg/mL.

The PTA for Streptococcus spp. and for Enterobacteriaceae was assessed separately but in a similar 
fashion. The table shows PTA taking into account MIC ranges reported for 2011 surveillance and Phase 
3 clinical isolates. 
Table 17 
Additional simulations were conducted to justify the ceftolozane dose regimens by examining the 
exposure and the PTA at the proposed doses across the full renal clearance range after incorporating 
the observed variability including both the covariate effects and the random effects that were identified 
in the POPPK model. The results were reported separately for cIAI vs. cUTI, considering the variability 
in PK between the two indications.  
Overall, at the proposed dose for each renal function category, the achievable PTA was slightly 
different between indications but it was ~90% or greater for bactericidal activity (1-log kill with 32.2% 
fT>MIC) at a ceftolozane MIC of 8 mg/L in patients at the upper end of each renal function category 
(e.g. CrCL=29, 50 or 150 mL/min). 
For patients with hyper renal clearance (CrCL>150 to 250 mL/min) simulation suggested >90% PTA 
for the 1-log kill target for ceftolozane MICs up to 4 mg/L for both cIAI and cUTI and a range of 70% 
(cUTI) 
-90% (cIAI) for MICs up to 8 mg/L using 1 g/0.5 g q8h and 1-h infusions.

Figures 9 & 10 
With regard to tazobactam, there is no widely accepted methodology for identifying the dose 
regimen. For the assessment of PTA taking into account MICs observed in Phase 3 isolates the 
tazobactam target of free-drug %T> threshold of 65.9% was evaluated, which was correlated with 
stasis in an in-vitro PD model (chemostat). Modelling for the ESBL-negative isolates was identical to 
that for ceftolozane alone. For ESBL-positive isolates, a multi-step, sequential algorithm was used to 
assess PTA by MIC value for each ceftolozane/tazobactam dosing regimen in each of the renal function 
categories defined above. Based on these analyses and on MICs for the Phase 3 isolates the figure 
below shows the PTA in relation to the MIC histograms for patients with normal renal function.  
With a ceftolozane/tazobactam regimen of 1g/0.5 g q8h at least 80% or greater simulated subjects 
with normal renal function were predicted to achieve the free-drug target for net bacterial stasis up to 
an MIC of 8 μg/mL and to achieve the target for 1-log CFU reduction up to an MIC of 4 μg/mL. 
However, 90% or more PTA occurs only at MICs of 1 mg/L or less.

In the UTI study, 14% of ME patients had molecularly confirmed ESBL-producing baseline pathogens. 
Of the 117 Enterobacteriaceae characterised 71% had at least a CTX-M-14 or CTX-M-15 enzyme. 
Table 18 
In the cIAI study cure rates for 58 ESBL-positive pathogens in the MITT dataset were 25/29 (86.2%) 
for ceftolozane-tazobactam vs. 24/29 (82.8%) for meropenem. Cure rates for E. coli with CTX-M-14 or 
CTX-M-15 ESBLs were 9/11 (81.8%) and 8/11 (72.7%), respectively.

In a 1994 study, Payne et al. reported the inhibition of tazobactam against 35 beta lactamases (20 
ESBLs and 15 conventional spectrum enzymes). The IC50 values demonstrated that tazobactam 
effectively inhibited most enzymes tested, with values below 1 μM for most Class A enzymes tested, 
including TEMs, SHVs and OXAs. More recent data demonstrate that for CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15 there 
are nanomolar IC50 values for tazobactam. Tazobactam concentrations of 1 μM can be achieved in 
plasma with >99% probability for >20% of the dose interval at the proposed dose in infected patients.

A further analysis of isolates obtained during the Phase 3 cUTI and cIAI studies showed that ESBL-
producing isolates expressed a range of enzymes including CTX-M-14, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-27, OXA-
1/30, OXA-10, TEM 1, TEM-176, SHV-1, SHV-11, and SHV-32 with many pathogens expressing more 
than one β-lactamase. The majority (65.2%) of ESBL enzymes identified in both E. coli and K. 
pneumoniae were CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15.  
In cUTI studies, the CTX-M-14/15 subpopulation of E. coli had ceftolozane/tazobactam MIC values 
ranging from 0.25 to >64 mg/L with the majority of MIC values between 0.25 and 1 mg/L (N=27). 
Clinical cure and eradication rates were high for patients with CTX-M-14/15 producing isolates with 
MIC values ≤ 1 μg/mL. Clinical and microbiologic success was recorded for 3 patients with E. coli 
isolates with MIC values ≥ 2 mg/L (2, 8 and > 64 mg/L). For the CTX-M-14/15 subpopulation of K. 
pneumoniae, the ceftolozane/tazobactam MIC values ranged from 0.25 mg/L to 32 mg/L and 
eradication and cure rates were comparable at all MIC values, though there were generally only single 
isolates at each MIC value. Clinical cure or microbiological eradication by MIC was not predictive for the 
presence of a CTX-M-15 K. pneumoniae isolate.

In the cIAI studies, the ceftolozane/tazobactam MIC values ranged from 0.25 to 4 mg/L for CTX-M-
14/15 subpopulation of E. coli baseline pathogens. All subjects with a CTX-M-14/15 positive E. coli 
were clinical cures. It is notable that the presence or absence of CTX-M-14/15 did not correlate with 
any change in clinical cure rates compared with the general E. coli population. For the CTX-M-14/15 
subpopulation of K. pneumoniae, the ceftolozane/tazobactam MIC values ranged from 1 to 16 mg/L. 
All subjects with a CTX-M-14/15 positive K. pneumoniae were classified as clinical cure. High clinical 
cure rates were associated with MIC values ≤ 8 mg/L.

It should be noted that the applicant has chosen a higher dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam for 
treatment of VAP (2 g/1 g q8h). In the applicant’s summary it is stated that results of the PD target 
attainment analyses for this 2 g/1 g ceftolozane/tazobactam q8h regimen in normal renal function and 
dosing regimens adjusted for renal function, which are based on the same nonclinical PD targets as 
described above, resulted in robust target attainment for MIC values approximately one-doubling

dilution step higher relative to the analyses for the 1 g/ 0.5 g regimen and adjustments for renal 
function.  
Effects on cardiac conduction 
In a TQT study (CXA-QT-10-02) in 52 male and female adults, testing therapeutic (1g/0.5g) and 
supra-therapeutic (3g/1.5g) doses of CXA- TAZ showed very slight increases (i.e. > 2 ms) of the 
baseline-adjusted QTcI for the supratherapeutic dose group through about 3 h post-dose and a nearly 
flat response for the therapeutic dose group. There was no indication of a differential effect due to 
gender. No subject had a QTcI interval > 450 ms.  One subject had values of QTcF > 450 ms following 
the 3 g / 1.5 g dose on a day when the baseline QTcF was 445 ms and the post-dose values ranged 
from 451 to 453 ms at 0.5, 1.0 and 16.5 hours post-dose.  
Study CXA-101-MD-11-07 included a further assessment of cardiac repolarization at the higher doses 
envisaged for certain types of infection (Ceftolozane-tazobactam 2g/ 1g q8h). The individually 
corrected QTc change from the pre-dose baseline using the Fridericia formula (QTcF = QT/RR0.33) on 
study Day 5 was the primary parameter for analysis. The primary endpoint analysis was determined by 
subtracting the baseline-adjusted placebo group from the baseline-adjusted 3g group to obtain the so-
called double-delta. This revealed insignificant differences at each time point vs. placebo after 5 days 
of dosing. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Ceftolozane appears to have straightforward PK in humans, which is characterised by low protein 
binding, dose proportionality up to 3 g doses, relatively low intra- and inter-subject variability and 
predominance of urinary excretion of unchanged drug. Distribution is into the extracellular 
compartment, including the ELF. In subjects with normal renal function the elimination half-life is short 
(~2.5-3 h) and independent of dose, so that accumulation was not observed after TID dosing for 10 
days. The estimated CLr approximates to mean total plasma clearance and both parameters are 
directly related to CrCL.  
Co-administration of tazobactam (0.5 g q8h) with ceftolozane (1 g q8h) did not show an effect of 
ceftolozane on tazobactam and there were only small increases in ceftolozane AUC. On co-
administration with ceftolozane the elimination half-life of tazobactam is around 1 h and there is no 
accumulation after 1 g q8h dosing for 10 days. Tazobactam has low binding to plasma proteins, 
distributes mainly into extracellular fluid with similar penetration into ELF as ceftolozane and is 
eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion involving OCT1 and OCT3. The plasma CL and 
CLr for tazobactam increase with increasing CrCL but some elimination is via conversion to the ring-
open form (M-1). After multiple doses, around 70% of the tazobactam dose appears in urine 
unchanged. 
The pharmacologically inactive metabolite of tazobactam (M-1) has a longer t½ of 3-4 h, suggestive of 
rate-limited elimination, which is not affected by co-administration with ceftolozane. As a result, M-1 
shows modest accumulation following repeated dosing with a median AI of <2-fold. However, on day 
10 of q8h dosing with 1 g/0.5 g of the combination the AUC for M-1 was about 5% of that for parent 
drug. M-1 plasma concentrations increase when renal function is impaired.  
Due to the lack of Phase 3 PK data the final POPPK analysis was based on Phase 1 and 2 data only. As 
expected, CrCL was the most significant covariate affecting the PK of ceftolozane and tazobactam. The 
model did not identify any baseline covariates that would require dose adjustment other than 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 54/101 
 
 
 
 
 
moderate or more severe degrees of renal impairment. The final models showed that presence of 
bacterial infection affected PK of ceftolozane and tazobactam, albeit to a minor or modest extent. 
Ceftolozane CL was higher in patients with infections and Vd was increased for both actives, 
particularly in IAI. As a result ceftolozane exposure is decreased by 20% in the presence of infection 
while tazobactam is unaffected.  
Based on accumulated non-clinical and clinical data the omission of in-vitro metabolism studies and a 
clinical mass balance study with ceftolozane alone and/or with the combination is accepted. In 
addition, taking into account the low protein binding, omission of a study in hepatic impairment is 
accepted. Based on the Phase I data in subjects with renal impairment and on the POPPK models the 
applicant has derived dose adjustment criteria not only for moderate impairment (which was 
implemented in Phase 3 studies) but also for severe impairment and ESRD, with and without HD. The 
available PK data support the proposals made in the SmPC. 
The potential for DDIs to occur seems to be relatively low.  
Overall, the approach to assessment of PK for ceftolozane and tazobactam/M-1 has been appropriate, 
with caveat that absence of PK data from patients in Phase 3 studies hampers to support confirmatory 
PK/PD and exposure-response analyses in infected patients.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The rationale for addition of tazobactam to form this FDC relies on its ability to protect ceftolozane 
from hydrolysis by some bacterial beta-lactamases produced by non-pseudomonal aerobic Gram-
negative organisms. However, it cannot be assumed that the dose of tazobactam that is approved for 
use with piperacillin is also appropriate for use with ceftolozane. Therefore it is essential that the data 
support adequacy of the tazobactam dose to inhibit common ceftolozane-hydrolysing enzymes. 
However, there is no well-established PK-PD methodology for identifying dose regimens for beta-
lactamase inhibitors.   
The following points were taken into account for tazobactam dose selection: 
 
There is a concentration-dependent effect of tazobactam on the activity of ceftolozane in the 
presence of beta-lactamases that can hydrolyse ceftolozane but are inhibited by tazobactam.  
  Hyper-production of beta-lactamases normally inhibited by tazobactam may result in failure of 
tazobactam at the usual clinical dose to protect ceftolozane from hydrolysis.  
 
 
The %T>threshold appears to be the important factor for efficacy of tazobactam.  
The non-clinical data indicate that the tazobactam thresholds vary by species and enzyme. 
Derivation of the %T>threshold targets predicted to be associated with stasis and 1-log or 2-log 
kill was based on very limited strains and enzymes. Different PD targets were estimated from the 
in-vivo neutropenic mouse thigh (NMT) infection model and from in-vitro chemostat models. The 
applicant finally focused on the lowest estimate, which was that obtained from the NMT model, 
stating that the in-vitro chemostat PD driver (½ MIC) for tazobactam was not consistent with other 
experiments that attempted to identify tazobactam thresholds. 
In relation to the Marketing Authorisation application, the following observations are made: 
1. 
2. 
In light of the indications studied it is not agreed that the clinical data support the adequacy of 
the tazobactam dose. This is because cIAI are mainly treated surgically, with adjunctive use of 
antibacterial agents and because cUTI is not a test of the adequacy of the dose when 
tazobactam, like ceftolozane, is mainly excreted renally, reaching high urinary concentrations.  
The applicant has stated that these results confirm the sufficiency of tazobactam exposure for 
efficacy against many Class A β-lactamase enzymes. The important point is that the 500 mg q8h 
dose is likely not sufficient, or is at least borderline, even for some Class A enzymes, especially if 
they are being produced in large amounts by certain species.

EMA/CHMP/388494/2015

3. 
4. 
It is very difficult to adequately convey in the SmPC the limitations of tazobactam, in terms of 
range of enzymes inhibited and the fact that the dose may not suffice in case of hyper-
production of beta-lactamases. 
Among the target pathogens for ceftolozane, tazobactam only contributes to the overall activity 
of ceftolozane against Enterobacteriaceae. Even against these species, tazobactam has several 
very important gaps in its inhibitory spectrum. There has to be considerable concern that many 
users of Zerbaxa will not appreciate its limitations, with a risk that it will be used empirically 
during the first and vital 24-48 h of therapy against organisms that are later confirmed to be 
resistant. 
Overall, the PK-PD justification for the tazobactam dose is not considered to be robust.  Data shown 
above (Figure 11) however suggests that provided the susceptibility breakpoint for enterobacteria is no 
more than 1 mg/L, the tazobactam dose may suffice to cover the majority of the common Class A 
enzymes.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The adequacy of the tazobactam dose in the FDC  has been poorly justified.  Nevertheless, the CHMP 
accepts  that  provided  the  susceptibility  breakpoint  for  enterobacteria  is  no  more  than  1  mg/L,  the 
tazobactam dose may suffice to cover the majority of the common Class A enzymes.  Since this is the 
EUCAST-recommended breakpoint for enterobacteria it seems possible to accept the tazobactam dose. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose ranging studies were performed.  The dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam (1.5 g every 8 hours) in 
the Phase 3 cUTI and cIAI trials was selected based on a comprehensive PK/PD analysis.  
In addition, the results of the Phase 2 studies in subjects with cUTI (CXA-101-03) and cIAI (CXA-10-
01) were provided in support for the dose selected. 
CXA-101-03 
This was a randomised (2:1) double-blind study that compared ceftolozane 1g q8h vs. ceftazidime 1 g 
q8h for 7 days to 10 days in cUTI, including pyelonephritis. For non-catheterised patients an eligible 
baseline culture was to have 1 or 2 bacterial isolates at ≥ 105 CFU/mL each. Cultures with >2 isolates 
were considered contaminated unless one of the pathogens was simultaneously isolated from blood. 
For catheterized subjects the urine was considered contaminated if >1 isolate was present in any 
number unless one isolate at ≥ 105 was also present in blood. Patient selection criteria were similar to 
Phase 3.

Figure 12 
Of the 127 treated patients > 90% completed the LFU visit. More ceftolozane patients had no 
uropathogen at baseline (23.5% vs. 9.3%) but more ceftazidime patients had no TOC culture (18.4% 
vs. 6.2%). The microbiological response rates were inconsistent between treatments in the two 
analysis populations. However, the failure rates were higher with ceftolozane in the mITT and ME 
populations.  
Table 26 
The cure rates did not differ significantly by region but they were lower for patients with cUTI vs. those 
with pyelonephritis due to the recurrences. Results of cUTI versus pyelonephritis were not provided for 
the ME population in the study report.

Both agents were highly effective against E. coli. Two ceftolozane patients had baseline uropathogens 
that were resistant to the drug based on MICs ≥32 μg/mL and both (one with S. aureus and one with 
E. cloacae) were microbiological failures at TOC (although the latter was a clinical cure at TOC). 
Table 28 
The 8 (12.3%) failures on ceftolozane and 3 (7.9%) on ceftazidime tended to be older than the overall 
mMITT population and 9/11 had cLUTI. Five of the 11 had E. coli as the baseline and persisting 
pathogen. None of the pathogens from 4 ceftolozane failures with baseline and post-baseline 
susceptibility test results developed resistance. Overall, 7/11 patients were clinical cures at TOC.  
The clinical response rates were slightly higher than the microbiological response rates, especially 
among subjects with cLUTI, reflecting asymptomatic bacteriuria detected at the TOC visit. The 
concordance rate between microbiological and clinical response at TOC in the mMITT population was 
83.1% (54/65) in the ceftolozane group and 84.2% (32/38) in the ceftazidime group.

There were six patients with E. coli in blood of which 3 in the ceftolozane group had documented 
eradication. 
There were 4 new infections with non-susceptible E. faecalis in the ceftolozane group. One patient 
per treatment group had a superinfection - C. albicans in the ceftolozane patient and E. faecalis in 
the ceftazidime patient. 
The sustained clinical cure rates at the LFU visit were 98.0% for ceftolozane and 92.6% for 
ceftazidime. Microbiological recurrence was uncommon (7.0% and 14.0%).

CXA-IAI-10-01 
This was a double-blind study in IAI that compared 4-7 days (but up to 14 days was allowed if needed) 
of ceftolozane-tazobactam 1g/0.5g q8h with metronidazole (at 500 mg q8h, used at the investigators 
discretion in upper GI infection and community based cholecystitis) vs. meropenem 1 g q8h using 2:1 
randomisation and stratification by primary site of infection (localised complicated appendicitis vs. 
other sites of IAI). Hospitalisation was mandatory for at least the first 9 doses (approximately 3 days).  
Eligible patients had one of the following conditions with evidence of intra-peritoneal infection: 
a. Cholecystitis with progression of the infection beyond the gallbladder wall 
b. Diverticular disease with perforation or abscess 
c. Appendiceal perforation or peri-appendiceal abscess 
d. Acute gastric or duodenal perforation if operated on > 24 h post-event 
e. Traumatic perforation of the intestine if operated on > 12 h post-event 
f. Peritonitis due to perforated viscus, postoperative or spread from other focus of infection  
g. Intra-abdominal abscess (including liver and spleen). 
Patients had to require surgical intervention within 24 h before or after the first dose of study drug. 
There were 121 patients randomised and treated (including 82 ceftolozane-tazobactam), of which > 
90% completed treatment and the LFU visit. The mMITT population comprised 86 patients (61 and 25 
per treatment group). The most common diagnosis was appendiceal perforation or peri-appendiceal 
abscess reported in 49% followed by cholecystitis and diverticular disease. No subjects had 
bacteraemia at baseline.  
For the primary analysis of clinical cure at the TOC visit in each of the mMITT and ME populations the 
cure rates were lower for ceftolozane-tazobactam.

The larger treatment difference in the mMITT population was ascribed to 4 indeterminate patients in 
the ceftolozane-tazobactam group who were excluded from the ME population. There were 6 vs. 1 
failures with features summarised below. 
Table 31 
Higher cure rates were observed for meropenem within each country, except one 83% in both groups). 
Clinical responses at TOC were similar for low-risk and high-risk subjects (latter included the elderly, 
those with higher APACHE II scores and/or decreased renal function). Clinical outcomes in both 
treatment groups were somewhat higher for subjects with a primary diagnosis of localised complicated 
appendicitis vs. other sites. 
In the ME population microbiological success was observed in 90.6% ceftolozane-tazobactam and 
95.8% meropenem patients.   
In the CE population the clinical cure rates at TOC were rather more comparable between groups.

Clinical and microbiological outcomes against the common Gram-negative aerobic pathogens (including 
E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa) were generally comparable between treatments but the 
clinical cure rates for Gram-negative anaerobes were 72.7% for ceftolozane-tazobactam vs. 100% for 
meropenem.  
Clinical relapse was uncommon (3%) in both treatment groups and there were no microbiological 
recurrences at the LFU visit. Three patients had emergent infections in the ceftolozane-tazobactam 
group, all associated with Gram-positive aerobes (E. avium, E. faecium and Staphylococcus aureus, E. 
faecalis). 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The applicant initiated two Phase 3 studies in each of the two claimed indications.  After obtaining 
agreement from the CHMP the applicant proceeded with a single study for each of the two (cUTI and 
cIAI) indications by pooling data from the 2 respective identical Phase 3 cUTI and cIAI protocols. 
Both integrated phase 3 studies were multicentre prospective, randomised, double-blind, and included 
male and female adult subjects (> 18 years of age) requiring intravenous treatment; patients with 
underlying immuno-compromising illnesses and/or those on immunosuppressant therapies were 
excluded, as were patients with severe or rapidly progressing disease such as septic shock, or those 
not expected to survive the 4-5 week study period. Subjects with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 
mL/min) and significant laboratory abnormalities were also excluded.  
CXA-cUTI-10-04-05:  
A Multicentre, Double-Blind, Randomised, Phase 3 Study to Compare the Safety and Efficacy 
of Intravenous Ceftolozane/Tazobactam and Intravenous Levofloxacin in Complicated 
Urinary Tract Infection, Including Pyelonephritis 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Eligible adults had a diagnosis of cUTI or pyelonephritis and met the following inclusion criteria: 
 
 
Pyuria (WBC count >10/μL in unspun urine or ≥10 per high power field in spun urine). 
Clinical signs and/or symptoms of cUTI, either of: 
a.  Pyelonephritis, as indicated by ≥ 2 of the following OR complicated lower UTI, as indicated 
by ≥ 2 of the following new or worsening symptoms of cUTI: 
•  Documented  fever  (oral  temperature  >38°C)  accompanied  by  subject  symptoms  of 
rigors, chills, or “warmth”; 
• Flank pain (for pyelonephritis); Suprapubic pain or flank pain (for cUTI) 
• Costovertebral angle tenderness or suprapubic tenderness on physical exam or  
• Nausea or vomiting 
• Dysuria; urinary frequency, or urinary urgency (for cUTI only) 
b.  Plus, for cUTI, at least 1 of the following complicating factors: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 61/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Males with documented history of urinary retention; 
• Indwelling urinary catheter, scheduled to be removed before the EOT;  
•  Current  obstructive  uropathy,  scheduled  to  be  medically  or  surgically  relieved  before 
the EOT; or  
•  Any  functional  or  anatomical  abnormality  of  the  urogenital  tract  (including  anatomic 
malformations or  neurogenic bladder) with voiding disturbance  resulting  in  at least 
100 mL residual urine. 
Pre-treatment baseline urine culture specimens were obtained within 24 h before the first dose of 
study drug. Subjects were enrolled before the Investigator knew the results of the baseline urine 
culture. No potentially effective antibacterial agents were allowed within 48 h prior to obtaining the 
baseline urine specimen.   
In non-catheterised subjects at least 1 and not more than 2 bacterial isolates at ≥105 CFU/mL each 
was required to qualify. If more than 2 bacterial isolates were identified, the culture was considered 
contaminated, unless 1 of the isolates that grew in the urine at ≥105 CFU/mL was also isolated from a 
blood culture at the same visit.  
In catheterised subjects a culture that grew >1 organism at any colony count was considered 
contaminated unless 1 of the isolates that grew in the urine at ≥105 CFU/mL was also isolated from a 
blood culture at the same visit. Local or regional laboratory urine culture results were used to 
determine subject eligibility. 
Treatments 
Subjects received (1:1 randomisation; block randomisation was used, stratified by investigational site) 
ceftolozane/tazobactam 1.5 g q8h over 1 h or levofloxacin 750 mg QD over 1.5 h for a fixed duration 
of 7 days but with an allowance for up to 9 days in case of removal of an indwelling catheter, recent 
bladder instrumentation or treatment for a urinary tract obstruction. The dose was adjusted in case of 
moderate renal insufficiency and discontinued if CrCL fell to < 30/ml/min. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. levofloxacin 
for microbiological eradication in the ME population at TOC (7 days [± 2 days] post-treatment based 
on a margin of 10% at a 1-sided 0.005 significance level. The comparison of eradication rates in the 
microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population was secondary. Microbiological 
“eradication” was defined as all baseline infecting pathogen(s) at <103 CFU/mL.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Central laboratory urine analysis was carried out on days -1, 3, at EOT, TOC and LFU. Further (local 
lab) analyses were carried out on study days 2 and 4-7 as indicated. 
Definitions of per-pathogen microbiological outcomes were: 
Eradication (EOT, TOC):  All baseline infecting pathogen(s) at <103 CFU/mL 
Presumed eradication (EOT): No EOT urine culture but last known urine obtained on day ≥ 3 on study 
drug showed all infecting pathogen(s) at <103 CFU/mL  
Persistence (EOT, TOC): ≥103 CFU/mL of any baseline pathogen; persistence at EOT was carried 
forward to TOC 
Indeterminate (EOT, TOC): No interpretable urine culture available at EOT or TOC and no previous 
urine culture after ≥ 3 days of study drug that is negative (no growth) 
Sustained Eradication (LFU): Urine obtained within the 21 to 42 days post-therapy window showed all 
baseline infecting pathogen(s) remained <103 CFU/mL 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 62/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Recurrence (LFU): Urine taken any time after documented eradication at the TOC visit and up to the 
time of LFU with ≥103 CFU/mL of the baseline infecting pathogen(s) 
Indeterminate (LFU): No urine culture obtained at LFU visit 
Definitions of clinical outcomes: 
Clinical Cure: Complete resolution or marked improvement in baseline signs and symptoms or return 
to pre-infection signs and symptoms without requirement for additional antibacterial therapy after EOT 
Clinical Failure: Persistence of ≥1 signs or symptoms of infection or reappearance of or new signs and 
symptoms that require additional or alternative antibacterial therapy 
OR AE leading to study drug discontinuation and need for non-study antibacterial therapy  
OR clinical failure at the EOT that was carried forward to the TOC visit 
Indeterminate: No evaluation of clinical outcome for any reason or outcome assessment confounded 
Sustained cure: No evidence of resurgence of baseline signs and symptoms after EOT 
Relapse: Signs and/or symptoms reappear between the TOC and LFU visits 
Sample size 
With 334 microbiologically evaluable patients randomised 1:1 the study had an overall power of ~80% 
in terms of the primary efficacy hypothesis. It was planned that 477 subjects per arm would be 
randomised across the consolidated CXA-cUTI-10-04 and CXA-cUTI-10-05 protocols assuming an 
evaluability rate of 70% and a response rate of 82.8%.  
Randomisation 
Randomisation (1:1) used IVRS/IWRS. Block randomisation was used, stratified by investigational site. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind.  An unblinded study site pharmacist or designee prepared and 
administered the study drug infusions. 
Statistical methods 
Due to the large number of investigational sites and small sample sizes expected per site, the primary 
and key secondary analyses were adjusted with the stratification factors of region and primary site of 
infection.  
Study populations were defined as follows: 
o 
ITT - all randomised 
o  Safety - all treated 
o  MITT- all randomised who received a dose of assigned therapy 
o  mMITT- all MITT with at least one qualified uropathogen at in baseline urine specimen  
o  CE at TOC - all mMITT who adhered to protocol, had a TOC visit within the specified visit window 
and had an outcome 
o  CE at LFU- all CE cures at TOC with LFU assessment or failed between TOC and LFU 
o  ME at TOC - all CE at TOC who had a urine culture with interpretable result at TOC 
o  ME at LFU - all ME successes at TOC with LFU assessment or failed between TOC and LFU

Results 
Participant flow 
In total 1083 were randomised and approximately 95% in both treatment arms completed the study, 
while 74.7% completed study drug. Around 25% of randomised patients were excluded from the 
mMITT as they had no qualifying baseline pathogen. Twelve patients who were not study failures 
received an active non-study antibacterial agent prior to TOC and were excluded from the ME and CE 
analysis populations. 
Figure 13 
Recruitment 
Around 75% of randomised subjects were enrolled in 123 sites in Europe. The remaining subjects were 
enrolled at 12 sites in South America, North America and the Rest of World. 
Conduct of the study 
After first subject enrolment, CXA-cUTI-10-04 and CXA-cUTI-10-05 were combined (Protocol version 
3.0 1 April 2013). In a further amendment, CHMP-specific primary and key secondary efficacy 
objectives, variables, analysis populations and key analyses were included. Pooling across studies was 
based on identical protocols. The treatment effect by protocol for the ME at TOC was explored and was 
confirmed to be comparable. 
A finding of GCP non-compliance with potential risk for data integrity was reported in a Sponsor audit, 
conducted after enrolment had closed at Site 5609 (6 patients). These 6 were excluded from the 
primary efficacy analysis and sensitivity analyses showed that this had no effect on the conclusions.  
Baseline data 
Baseline demographic characteristics of the ME and mMITT populations were comparable between 
treatment groups. The overall demographics of the study population reflected the fact that 81.8% of 
subjects had pyelonephritis so that only 18.2% had cUTI. Thus females of younger age range 
predominated. For example, in the ME population the mean age was 45 years and 81% were female 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 64/101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with mean CrCL 98 mL/min. In the cUTI population the mean age was 64 years, 61% were male and 
mean CrCL was 84 mL/min. 
Outcomes and estimation 
In the primary analysis non-inferiority was demonstrated. The 95% CI of the % difference between 
treatments did not span 1.0 and favoured ceftolozane-tazobactam. Non-inferiority was also 
demonstrated within the subset with acute pyelonephritis in the ME and mMITT populations and after 
exclusion of patients with levofloxacin-resistant pathogens. 
Microbiological response rates in patients with cUTI in both treatment arms were lower vs. 
pyelonephritis but numerically higher for the test agent vs. levofloxacin even after exclusion of 
levofloxacin-resistant pathogens. The results of all sensitivity analyses were consistent with the 
primary outcome. 
Table 33 
In the mMITT population 57 (14.3%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 94 (23.4%) in the 
levofloxacin group were observed failures and cUTI cases predominated. Most of the microbiological 
failures were clinical successes and were considered to have asymptomatic bacteriuria. 
Microbiological response rates for Gram-negative aerobes were higher with ceftolozane/tazobactam 
than with levofloxacin, reflecting the level of baseline resistance to the latter. In contrast few Gram-
positive aerobes were eradicated in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group. Approximately 14% of ME 
patients had molecularly confirmed ESBL-producers (of 117 Enterobacteriaceae characterised 71% 
were positive for at least a CTX-M-14 or CTX-M-15 enzyme). For E. coli and K. pneumoniae eradication 
rates were lower for ESBL-producing isolates, with evidence of fluoroquinolone co-resistance 
phenomena.

Superinfections were observed on 3.8% ceftolozane/tazobactam and 5.7% levofloxacin patients and 
new infections occurred in 8.8% and 6.5%. Enterococci predominated in these patients.  
Ancillary analyses 
The subgroup analyses showed some important findings, several of which were influenced by the 
interplay between factors linked to the baseline diagnosis and the predominance of patients with 
pyelonephritis. Hence interpretation of the subgroup findings must take into account the differences in 
CHMP assessment report

gender, age and CrCL between the pyelonephritis and cUTI groups. The apparent geographical 
differences may also be linked to the type of patient mostly enrolled at some sites. 
Due to the rates of baseline fluoroquinolone resistance it is important to note the outcomes for the 
subsets with levofloxacin-susceptible or resistant pathogens at baseline. Among the levofloxacin-
resistant pathogens inevitably ceftolozane-tazobactam did better but the responses were much lower 
than for the levofloxacin-susceptible patients. This apparent difference reflected the summation of 
predominance of cUTI patients with levofloxacin-resistant pathogens and co-resistance between FQ-R 
determinants and expression of beta-lactamases that hydrolysed ceftolozane despite the presence of 
tazobactam.

Table 36 
There were 24 ME patients with bacteraemia treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam and 23/24 had 
pyelonephritis. The single patient with cLUTI was infected with K. oxytoca susceptible to both study 
drugs and achieved microbiological and clinical success. The 23 patients with pyelonephritis had 
monomicrobial infections including 20 with E. coli (2 of which were confirmed ESBL producers) and 
single patients with each of K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and E. aerogenes (also ESBL-positive). Twenty 
of 23 (87%) patients achieved microbiological success at TOC. The 3 failures had E. coli, one of which 
was ESBL positive. Clinical success was reported for 22/23 and the single failure was infected with an 
ESBL-negative E. coli. 
There were 241 patients in the ME population (127 [37.4%] ceftolozane-tazobactam vs. 114 [32.3%] 
levofloxacin) with renal impairment at baseline, most of whom had mild renal impairment. Dosing 
adjustments were required when CLCR was ≤ 50 mL/min and 23/51 patients received appropriate 
adjusted doses at baseline.  
The microbiological outcomes for renally impaired patients compared very closely to those for the 
general population. In the ceftolozane-tazobactam group the microbiological outcomes for the subsets 
with moderate or severe renal impairment, with and without appropriate dose adjustment at baseline, 
were only slightly lower compared to those with normal renal function.

For the 567 patients with pyelonephritis in the ME population, the eradication rates were generally 
consistent with the primary analysis as far as can be discerned based on some small denominators.  
CXA-cIAI-10-08-09: A Multicentre, Double-blind, Randomised, Phase 3 Study to Compare 
the Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Ceftolozane/Tazobactam with that of Meropenem in 
Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Eligible adults had to meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 
o  Had 1 of the following diagnoses (with evidence of intraperitoneal infection): 
a.  Cholecystitis  (including  gangrenous)  with  rupture,  perforation,  or  progression  of  the 
infection  
beyond the gallbladder wall; 
b. Diverticular disease with perforation or abscess; 
c. Appendiceal perforation or peri-appendiceal abscess (limited to 30% in protocol); 
d.  Acute  gastric  or  duodenal  perforation,  only  if  operated  on  >24  hours  after  perforation 
occurred; 
e.  Traumatic  perforation  of  the  intestine,  only  if  operated  on  >12  hours  after  perforation 
occurred; 
f. Peritonitis due to other perforated viscus or following a prior operative procedure; 
g. Subjects with inflammatory bowel disease or ischaemic bowel disease were eligible provided 
there was bowel perforation. 
h. Intra-abdominal abscess (including liver or spleen);  
o  Required surgical intervention within 24 hours of (before or after) the first dose of study drug   
o 
If  failed  prior  antibacterial  treatment  for  the  current  cIAI,  must  have  a  positive  culture  from  an 
intra-abdominal site and require surgical intervention 
o  Evidence of systemic infection including one or more of the following was also required: 
a. Temperature (oral) greater than 38°Celsius (C) or less than 35°C; 
b. Elevated white blood cells (WBC; >10 500/mm3); 
c.  Abdominal  pain,  flank  pain,  or  pain  likely  due  to  cIAI  that  is  referred  to  another  anatomic 
such as back or hip; or 
d. Nausea or vomiting. 
area  
Pre-operative enrolment and dosing was acceptable, provided that the sample from the site of infection 
is obtained during the interventional procedure. 
Treatments 
Patients received (1:1) ceftolozane/tazobactam 1.5 g q8h plus metronidazole 500 mg q8h as 
consecutive 1-h infusions or meropenem 1 g q8h as 1-h infusions for 4-10 days (max 14 days).  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority for ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. meropenem 
based on cure rates at TOC; 26 to 30 days from randomisation) in the CE population using a margin of 
12.5% at a 1-sided 0.005 significance level. The analysis in the ITT population was secondary. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
An EOT visit occurred within 24 h after the last dose of study drug. The TOC was 26 to 30 days after 
the first dose of study drug and the LFU visit at 38 to 45 days after the first dose of study drug. 
Definitions of clinical outcomes: 
Clinical Cure (EOT, TOC): Complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms such 
that no antibacterial therapy or surgical or drainage procedure was required for the index infection  
Clinical Failure: Death related to IAI, persisting or recurrent infection requiring additional intervention, 
need for additional antibacterial therapy or surgical wound infection

Indeterminate (TOC, LFU): Study data were not available for evaluation of efficacy for any reason 
Sustained clinical cure (at LFU): no signs or symptoms recur or worsen since TOC 
Relapse: Signs, symptoms and/or radiographic findings of IAI (including wound infection) recur or 
worsen since the TOC 
Microbiological response  
Site of infection sample for culture was obtained at screening and further samples if clinically indicated. 
Samples were analysed in a central laboratory. The usual definitions were applied. For an overall 
microbiological response of success all baseline pathogen were to be eradicated. 
Sample size 
Randomisation (1:1) of 494 per treatment arm across the two studies (CXA-cIAI-10-08 and CXA-cIAI-
10-09) was expected to provide 370 CE patients per treatment, which would provide an overall power 
of  ~ 99% in terms of the primary hypothesis assuming an evaluability rate of 75% and cure rate of 
86.6%.  
Randomisation 
Randomisation (1:1) used IVRS/IWRS. Block randomisation was used, stratified by investigational site. 
There was stratification by primary site of infection with 2 levels: bowel (small or large) vs. other sites 
Blinding (masking) 
The study were double-blind. An unblinded study site pharmacist or designee prepared and 
administered the study drug infusions. 
Statistical methods 
Study populations were defined as follows: 
o 
ITT and Safety – as above 
o  MITT - all randomised with a pathogen isolated from an appropriate baseline specimen 
o  CE  -  all  randomised  who  received  an  adequate  amount  of  study  drug,  met  the  protocol-specific 
disease definition of cIAI, adhered to study protocol and had a TOC visit within the window 
o  ME - all CE with a pathogen susceptible to the study drug 
o  Expanded ME - all in the MITT population who met all CE criteria.   
Results 
Participant flow 
Patient disposition is shown in the figure. There were 23 subjects from 2 study sites excluded from the 
ITT population due to concerns regarding integrity of data. The imbalance in the proportions eligible for 
the ME population reflected higher numbers in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group without a baseline 
pathogen, with a non-susceptible pathogen or without a clinical outcome at TOC.

Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled at 128 sites with ~80% enrolled in Europe and 10.5% in S. America. 
Conduct of the study 
After first enrolment CXAcIAI-10-08 and CXA-cIAI-10-09 were combined with a plan to enrol ~500 per 
protocol and a change in the level of significance (Protocol version 3.2 10 April 2013). The primary 
analysis was changed to the CE population. There was no significant treatment-by-protocol interaction 
in either population. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics were generally balanced between treatment groups. Despite the protocol limit 
infections originating from the appendix predominated (48% in the CE population). The mean age was 
50.7 years and only 23% were aged > 65 years. Less than one third had renal impairment and > 80% 
had an APACHE II score <10 (median 5).

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary analysis demonstrated non-inferiority. The actual cure rates were very high in both 
treatment groups. Results for the ITT population and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the 
primary analysis. 
Table 38 
In the ITT population (counting observed failures and default failures) failures in the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam group were more likely to be elderly subjects (44.2% vs. 27.1%), have 
peritonitis (76.6% vs. 64.3%) and have had a laparotomy (64.9% vs. 48.6%) compared to 
meropenem-treated failures. For CE patients with bacteraemia clinical (and microbiological) failure was 
seen in 2/8 (25%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and in 1/13 (7.7%) in the meropenem group. 
The majority of microbiological assessments were presumed (only 27 patients had a documented 
microbiological outcome) and therefore largely reflected clinical responses.  
o  For the 58 ESBL-positive pathogens in the MITT dataset the clinical cure rates were 25/29 
(86.2%) for ceftolozane-tazobactam vs. 24/29 (82.8%) for meropenem. Cure rates for E. coli with 
CTX-M-14 or CTX-M-15 ESBLs were 9/11 (81.8%) and 8/11 (72.7%), respectively. 
o 
In the MITT population 68/69 P. aeruginosa were susceptible to ceftolozane/tazobactam and 
62/69 susceptible to meropenem. Overall cure rates were 30/38 (79%) vs. 30/34 (88%). Of 52 P. 
aeruginosa isolates tested, 8 (15.4%) over-expressed AmpC and had ceftolozane/tazobactam

MICs in the range 0.5-16 μg/mL, of which 7 had MICs ≤ 8 μg/mL. Five of the 8 were treated with 
ceftolozane/tazobactam and 4 were cured. 
Table 39 
Approximately 75% of patients were clinically evaluable at LFU and none had a relapse. 
Superinfections were seen in 10/389 (2.6%) vs. 13/417 (3.1%) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and 
meropenem groups, respectively, while 12/389 (3.1%) vs. 9/417 (2.2%) had new infections. There 
was no consistent pattern for superinfecting pathogens (26 species) or new infection pathogens (27 
species), although E. faecium and E. faecalis accounted for 6 vs. 5 superinfections and 6 vs. 4 new 
infections per group. No emergence of decreased susceptibility or resistance was observed. 
Ancillary analyses 
The sub-group analyses mostly showed point estimates that favoured meropenem. The difference was 
more marked in the ITT population, which the applicant ascribed to higher rates of indeterminate 
outcomes in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group. This difference reflected several factors but was mainly 
driven by premature discontinuations of study drug due to AEs and patient withdrawals.

There were no significant differences between treatment groups for cure rates in the CE and ITT 
populations by primary site of infection but there were differences in cure rates for each treatment 
according to the primary site. For example, cure rates for appendiceal infections were 96.6% vs. 
96.4% in the CE and 89% vs. 91.8% in the ITT populations but cure rates for colonic primary sites 
were 84.2% vs. 87.5% and 66.1% vs. 71.4% in respective populations. 
Older patients (> 65 – 75 years) had lower clinical response rates in both the CE and ITT population 
with ceftolozane/tazobactam than with meropenem. In this group, the primary site of infection was 
more frequently the bowel. No significant difference was observed in patients < 65 or > 75 years of 
age. 
Figure 16 
Clinical response rates were lower in North America (approximately 69%) than in Eastern Europe 
(approximately 89%) for both study treatments. The majority was enrolled in E. Europe but the 
proportion with appendicitis (41%) was about the same as that in N. America (44%) and pooled other 
countries (40%). Also, similar proportions were aged < 65 years in E. Europe vs. pooled other 
countries.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Overall, the choice of the dosage regimen for the Phase 3 studies is based on pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic considerations as well as tolerability. No formal dose-finding study has been 
performed and the same dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam (1.5 g every 8 hours) is used in both of the 
applied indications.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Marketing Authorisation application rests on two single pivotal studies that generally comply with 
CHMP guidance regarding patient selection criteria, analyses populations and non-inferiority margins 
but do not comply with recommendations regarding the types of infections to be treated or, at least, 
the proportions of specific types of infections that could support the indications sought of cUTI and 
cIAI. 
The choice of the dosage regimen for the Phase 3 studies is based on pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic considerations as well as tolerability. No formal dose-finding study has been 
performed and the same dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam (1.5 g every 8 hours) is used in both of the 
applied indications. However, it is questioned whether the performed PK/PD studies are sufficient in 
order to conclude on the optimal dose. 
cUTI 
The efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) was evaluated in 
one pooled, multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, Phase 3 study that 
enrolled 1083 patients. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam versus 
levofloxacin in adult subjects with cUTI, including pyelonephritis based on the difference in 
microbiological response rate in the microbiologically evaluable (n=693) population at the Test-of-Cure 
(TOC) visit.  
Patients were randomly assigned to receive in a 1:1 ratio either ceftolozane/tazobactam IV (1.5 g 
every 8 hours) or levofloxacin IV (750 mg every 8 hours) and a matching saline IV placebo infusion for 
7 days. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 79/101 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Levofloxacin was selected as the comparator and the applicant justifies this choice by stating that it is 
the most widely used agent for treatment of cUTI worldwide.  The dose of levofloxacin used was higher 
than that recommended in the EU SmPC. However, based on the CLSI breakpoint, 30% of Gram-
negative pathogens and 57% of Gram-positive pathogens were resistant to levofloxacin. This biased 
the overall results in favour of ceftolozane/tazobactam and demonstrated that levofloxacin was not a 
good choice of comparator for the selected study sites.  
In general, the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the pivotal study are acceptable.  There was one 
specific inclusion criterion stating that all patients included required IV antibacterial therapy for the 
treatment of the presumed cUTI indicating that the infections should be severe. However, an 
evaluation of severity of the infection and the symptoms (according to e.g. systemic laboratory 
diagnostic factors [i.e. CRP, leucocytes], presence of urosepsis) was lacking.  
For the cLUTI diagnosis, there were differences between the treatment arms especially regarding the 
reasons for complications but also in the numbers of complicating factors. In the levofloxacin arm, 
fewer patients had 2 or more complicating factors such as indwelling catheter (7.6% vs. 13.3% in the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam arm), or were males with documented urinary retention (36.4% vs. 53.3% in 
the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm).  
The demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment arms.  Most of the 
patients were white, females with a mean age of 48 years of age and recruited from Eastern Europe. A 
minority were elderly; approximately 24% were 65 years of age or older.  
The total proportion of subjects randomised with acute pyelonephritis was approximately 80%, and 
stratification at enrolment according to diagnosis was not performed (studies predated current CHMP 
guideline).  The most commonly isolated pathogen was as expected in this indication, E.coli 545/693 
(78.6%), of which, 188/693 (27.1%) subjects had levofloxacin-resistant baseline uropathogens; 89 
subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam treatment arm and 99 in the levofloxacin treatment arm, while 
54/693 (7.8%) subjects had baseline uropathogens resistant to ceftolozane/tazobactam; 27 subjects 
in each treatment arm in the ME at TOC population. 
The incidence of subjects with bacteraemia at baseline was 7.2% in the ME at TOC population and was 
balanced across the 2 treatment arms. The most common blood pathogen isolated at baseline was 
E.coli:16/24 (4.7%) pathogens in the ceftolozane/tazobactame treatment arm and 16/26 (4.5%) in 
the levofloxacin treatment arm. 
Small number of pathogens were confirmed to be: ESBL-positive, or to be E. coli with CTX-M-14/CTX-
M-15 ESBLs or P. aeruginosa overexpressing AmpC.  Ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated activity 
against these resistant pathogens, however, no firm conclusions of the efficacy of 
ceftolozane/tazobactam towards these pathogens can be made due to limited numbers. 
cIAI 
The efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam in complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) was evaluated 
in one pooled, multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-dummy, Phase 3 study that 
included 993 patients.  
The study aimed to demonstrate non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole versus 
meropenem in adult subjects with cIAI based on the difference in clinical cure rates at the Test-of-Cure 
(TOC) visit in the Clinically Evaluable (CE) population (ceftolozane/tazobactam minus meropenem).  
Patients were randomly assigned to receive in a 1:1 ratio either ceftolozane/tazobactam IV (1.5 g 
every 8 hours) plus metronidazole IV (500 mg every 8 hours) or meropenem IV (1 g every 8 hours) 
and a matching saline IV placebo infusion for 4-10 days (if study drug discontinuation criteria were not 
met by study day 10, the patients could receive treatment up to 14 days). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 80/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Meropenem was selected as the comparator. Meropenem is considered appropriate for the treatment 
of complicated IAIs, if the patients are severely ill (defined as, among other things, APACHE II scores 
> 15, advanced age, degree of peritoneal involvement/diffuse peritonitis, immunocompromised state, 
severe physiological disturbance). In general, severe intra-abdominal infections as seen in e.g. 
nosocomial infections where the risk of resistant pathogens is much higher compared to community-
acquired infections, would justify the use of broad-spectrum carbapenems (like meropenem). 
As most intra-abdominal infections are polymicrobial, involving both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, 
metronidazole was added to the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm with the intension of protecting against 
organisms not covered by ceftolozane/tazobactam. This is considered appropriate and in line with 
clinical recommendations. 
The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate in the CE population at the TOC visit. Key secondary 
endpoint was the clinical cure rate in the ITT population at the TOC visit. This is in accordance with the 
recommendations for cIAI set out in the current CHMP guidance (Addendum to the guideline on the 
evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections; 
EMA/CHMP/351889/2013). 
The inclusion criteria ensured that the intra-abdominal infections could be considered “complicated”, as 
the required infections will lead to infectious processes proceeding beyond the organ that is the source 
of the infection. In general, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including diagnoses and use of 
concomitant antibiotics, are in line with those used in previous studies on cIAI. Overall, the included 
types of intra-abdominal infections could be categorised as infections that are neither so limited that 
just surgery would be curative nor so complicated that several additional confounding factors would 
affect cure.  
The treatment groups were generally well matched with respect to gender, age, ethnicity, race, BMI 
and disease characteristics. The majority of the enrolled subjects were male, white, had a normal renal 
function and were younger than 65 years (ITT population). Most subjects were recruited from Europe 
(in total 78.8%). 
The severity of cIAI was classified using the APACHE II scoring system, in addition to assessment of 
the infectious process, signs of systemic infection and presence/absence of bacteraemia. Patients were 
analysed by APACHE II scores ≥ 10 and < 10. The chosen cut-off might have led to a relatively low 
enrolment of severely ill patients into the study.  
E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis were the most common aerobic, Gram-negative, 
baseline-infecting intra-abdominal pathogens isolated. Overall, this is as expected in these kinds of 
infections. Of the anaerobes, the Gram-negative anaerobes were most commonly isolated and of these 
Bacteroides fragilis as most prominent.  
P. aeruginosa is generally more seldom detected in community-acquired cIAIs. Small numbers of  
pathogens were confirmed to be: ESBL-positive, or to be E. coli with CTX-M-14/CTX-M-15 ESBLs or P. 
aeruginosa overexpressing AmpC. Ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated activity against these 
resistant pathogens, however, no firm conclusions of the efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam plus 
metronidazole towards these pathogens can therefore be made due to limited numbers. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
cUTI 
Non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to levofloxacin was demonstrated both for the 
primary endpoint microbiological response rate in the ME at TOC population (84.7% in the 
ceftalozane/tazobactam arm vs. 75.4% in the levofloxacin arm) and for the key secondary endpoint 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 81/101 
 
 
 
 
 
the microbiological response rate in the mMITT at TOC population (78.6% in the 
ceftalozane/tazobactam arm vs. 69.9% in the levofloxacin arm). The lower limits of both the 99% CIs 
were within -10 % (9.4 [1.54, 17.12] for the ME population and 8.7 [0.77, 16.57] for the mMITT 
population).  
Non-inferiority was demonstrated for ceftolozane vs. levofloxacin in the subset with levofloxacin-
susceptible pathogens as well as in a range of sensitivity analyses. Among the strains that were 
susceptible to levofloxacin, the microbiological success rates in the ME population at TOC were 93% for 
ceftolozane/tazobactam and 88% for levofloxacin.  A post hoc evaluation indicated that 18% (96/567; 
47 ceftolozane/tazobactam and 49 levofloxacin) of patients with pyelonephritis had a complicating 
factor. These patients with complicated pyelonephritis were generally older (mean age 57.8 years) and 
had a higher incidence of renal impairment (41.7%). There was a very high risk for microbial 
recurrence at the TOC visit explaining the lower microbiological eradication rates compared to the 
overall population with pyelonephritis (66.0% for ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. 65.3% for levofloxacin). 
The study provides poor support for cLUTI, with only 60 vs. 66 ME patients with this diagnosis. In a 
sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint limiting the population with cLUTI to patients with 
levofloxacin-susceptible pathogens the cure rate for ceftolozane/tazobactam in the ME population was 
25/28 (89.3%) vs. 25/29 (86.2%) for levofloxacin (3.1% diff; 95% CI -15.37, 21.25). 
cIAI 
Non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole compared to meropenem was 
demonstrated both for the primary endpoint clinical cure rate in CE at TOC (94.1% in the 
ceftalozane/tazobactam arm vs. 94% in the meropenem arm) and for the key secondary endpoint 
clinical cure rate in ITT at TOC (83.8% in the ceftalozane/tazobactam arm vs. 85.8% in the 
meropenem arm). The lower limits of both the 99% CIs were within -12.5% (0.0 [-4.16, 4.30] for the 
CE population and -2.2 [-7.95, 3.44] for the ITT population). 
Results from the sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy outcome and the key secondary efficacy 
outcome supported the results seen for the primary and the key secondary analyses, respectively.  
Ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole showed significant and corresponding activity against the 
common IAI pathogens as evidenced by the high per-pathogen microbiological eradication rates. The 
results were comparable to the rate observed for the meropenem group (over 90% in both arms for all 
Gram-negative aerobes, Gram-negative anaerobes, Gram-positive aerobes and Gram-positive 
anaerobes). The most commonly isolated pathogen was E. coli and the eradication rate was 96% for 
ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole vs. 95.1% in the meropenem arm, with a 95% CI of 0.9 (-
3.34, 5.05) in the microbiological evaluable (ME) population. The eradication rate, however, was lower 
for Enterobacter cloacae and Streptococcus anginosus for ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. meropenem. 
This indicates that these pathogens have lower susceptibility to ceftolozane/tazobactam (which was 
also reflected by the rather high MIC-values observed for ceftolozane/tazobactam for these specific 
microorganisms).  
The per-subject microbiological success rate at TOC was high in the ME population (96% in the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole arm vs. 95.6% in the meropenem arm with 95% CI of 0.4 
[-3.13, 3.69]). These results were supported by the results achieved for the MITT population.  
A high cure rate (> 95%) was observed in both treatment arms at EOT indicating a rapid initial effect 
of ceftolozane/tazobactam.  
At LFU both study groups showed a high degree of durability of clinical effect with few relapses since 
the TOC visit (none for ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. 2 in the meropenem arm). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 82/101 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical cure rates were comparable between the two treatment arms for subjects with a polymicrobial 
infection in the CE population and those with a monomicrobial infection in the CE and ITT populations. 
This result was not fully supported by the results achieved in the ITT population for the polymicrobial 
infections as the lower end of the 95% CI was below -12.5%. 
About half of ITT and CE patients had a primary focus of infection in the appendix (compared to a 
maximum of 30% recommended in current CHMP guidance). In ITT and ME populations the cure rates 
were very high for infections of appendiceal origin (e.g. ITT 89% ceftolozane/tazobactam and 92% 
meropenem) and much lower for infections originating from the colon (e.g. ITT 66% vs. 71%). 
Subgroup analyses seem to indicate that ceftolozane/tazobactam performs more poorly compared to 
meropenem in “high-risk” patients; more than 80% of patients in the study had an APACHE score <10 
and that, especially in the ITT population, point estimate cure rates were numerically lower for 
ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. meropenem in those with APACHE scores > 10 (most of whom had non-
appendiceal primary infection), in patients aged > 65 years (in whom the primary site of infection was 
more often the bowel) and in those with multiple abscess or diffuse peritonitis. Correlating with these 
findings the failures in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group were more likely to be elderly subjects 
(44.2% vs. 27.1% meropenem failures), have peritonitis (76.6% vs. 64.3%) and have had a 
laparotomy (64.9% vs. 48.6%). Cure rates were also lower in patients with moderate impairment of 
renal function compared to those with normal or mildly impaired renal function. However, this was 
observed in both treatment groups and the denominators were relatively small such that it is not 
possible to conclude that there was a real difference between treatments in this regard.  
The applicant attempted to address these concerns based on the fact that outcomes were comparable 
between treatments in the CE population and that the imbalances that caused concern were due to 
higher rates of indeterminate outcomes in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group, which defaulted to 
failures in the ITT population analysis. Indeed, 42/76 ITT patients with an indeterminate clinical 
response were in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group. The difference reflected 23 vs. 16 with premature 
discontinuation of study drug for reasons that included AEs (2.1% vs. 0.8%), withdrawal (1.9% vs. 
1.2%) and deaths unrelated to cIAI (1.5% vs. 1.0%).   
Additional expert consultation 
The CHMP consulted the Infectious Diseases Working Party (IDWP) on the suitability of the indications 
(Annex 8). 
Reference was made to the Addendum to the core guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products 
indicated for treatment of bacterial infections (Addendum to CPMP/EWP/558/95 Rev 2) which states: 
“If the range of infection types that has been studied within each indication is considered to be limited 
or was restricted to specific pathogens it might be considered necessary to further qualify the 
indication. In addition, a qualification of an indication may be needed if there is clear evidence that the 
test agent does not provide adequate efficacy in a specific and important subset of patients that would 
otherwise be assumed to be included under the indication.  
An alternative to qualification of the indication is to mention the limitations of the data only in section 
4.4, with a cross-reference from section 4.1. For example, this may apply when very few cases of 
concomitant bacteraemia or very few cases of a particular type of infection have been treated within 
any one indication and when an indication for use has been based on very limited data.” 
It was clarified that the cited guideline passage considers the consequences of a limited dataset. This 
may refer to limitations in terms of the representation of a subset of patients defined by clinical 
syndrome, or a subset of the microorganisms that may cause the clinical syndrome. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/388494/2015  
Page 83/101 
 
 
 
 
 
In the case that the limitation resides in the number of patients represented in the subset, the crucial 
distinction between a restriction of indication and a mention of the limitation of data, is based on 
whether the totality of evidence, including PK/PD considerations, allow for an inference of positive B/R 
in the relevant subset of patients. Given that a positive benefit-risk (B/R) can be concluded, no 
restriction in the indication is mandated; however, the limitations to data may relate to the precision of 
the efficacy estimate, and to the relative efficacy versus the comparator/standard of care. In such 
cases, a cautionary statement of the lack of data, rather than a restriction of the indication, may be 
mandated for the consideration of the prescriber. 
Further, it is not unusual that some of the pathogens that may cause the clinical syndrome for which 
the agent is indicated, are known to have limited or no susceptibility to the drug. It might also be 
unclear whether drug exposure at the proposed dose is sufficient in case of reduced susceptibility. In 
such situations, it may be preferable to describe considerations on microbial susceptibility in sections 
4.4 and/or 5.1 rather than formally restricting the indication with respect to the microbial cause of the 
syndrome in question. 
In drafting the guideline, careful consideration was given to situations in which a relevant 
subpopulation studied was so limited that section 4.1 might have to be restricted accordingly. 
However, it was not possible to provide specific recommendations given that this would depend on the 
available data. Specific recommendations are unlikely to be able to anticipate all potential situations. 
For example, if ceftolozane/tazobactam was not mainly excreted unchanged in the urine the efficacy 
shown for acute pyelonephritis could not be used to heavily support use in cUTI. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
For the overall ME population in study CXA-cUTI-10-04 /CXA-cUTI-10-05, 81.8% had pyelonephritis 
and non-inferiority was demonstrated for ceftolozane vs. levofloxacin in the subset with levofloxacin-
susceptible pathogens as well as in a range of sensitivity analyses. A post hoc evaluation indicated that 
18% (96/567; 47 ceftolozane/tazobactam and 49 levofloxacin) of patients with pyelonephritis had a 
complicating factor.  
The study provides poor support for cUTI, with only a small number of ME patients with this diagnosis.  
Nevertheless, CHMP accepts that ceftolozane/tazobactam may be of use in patients with cUTI infected 
with certain ESBL-producing pathogens. On this basis, the indications have been separated with a 
cross-reference from complicated urinary tract infections to section 4.4 where the limitations of the 
evidence for use in cUTI are summarised in a paragraph. 
Although the study CXA-cIAI-10-08 / CXA-cIAI-10-09 met its pre-defined primary endpoint, with 
supportive sensitivity analyses, the broad indication of cIAI based on this single pivotal study is poorly 
supported.  
About half of ITT and CE patients had a primary focus of infection in the appendix compared to a 
maximum of 30% recommended in CHMP guidance. On this basis, it is not unexpected that half of the 
total patients received 4-7 days therapy. In ITT and ME populations the cure rates were very high for 
infections of appendiceal origin (e.g. ITT 89% ceftolozane/tazobactam and 92% meropenem) and 
much lower for infections originating from the colon (e.g. ITT 66% vs. 71%).   
Since there is only one “not very satisfactory” study, the CHMP accepts the indication on condition of a 
cross-reference to section 4.4 SmPC, where the major limitations of the population studies are 
reflected, including the percentage with appendiceal infections, the low APACHE II scores and the few 
cases of accompanying bacteraemia.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The primary data to support the safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam come from the two Phase 3 studies. 
In Phase 3 studies ceftolozane/tazobactam was administered with metronidazole in the cIAI study, the 
comparators were different and the patient characteristics varied according to the type of infection 
(e.g. 70% female in cUTI but 41% in cIAI). Therefore it is important to review the safety data by 
indication as well as overall for the final selected dose regimen.  
There were 1015 patients enrolled and treated in the Phase 3 studies, most of whom received 4-<8 
(362 vs. 401 comparator) or 8-<11 (522 vs. 521) days of assigned treatment.  
Adverse events 
The safety profile in Phase 3 studies was broadly comparable between treatments within each 
indication. Overall rates of AEs did not increase with duration of therapy.

The reporting rates were consistently higher with ceftolozane/tazobactam in both indications for 
nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, pyrexia, headache, hypotension, hypokalaemia and for each of 
ALT and AST increased. Administration site events were reported in <1% of subjects. 
Most TEAEs occurred within 72 hours of starting study drug (in 70% and 68% of patients reporting AEs 
in respective treatment groups, pooled across studies) and the majority were documented to have 
resolved (in 79% and 77% with TEAEs). Less than 15% of patients had drug-related TEAEs reported 
by investigators. The most common were nausea, diarrhoea, headache and transaminase increases.  
Table 45 
The applicant also generated a list of ADRs after review of TEAEs in the Phase 3 studies for possible 
causal relationship, taking into account known class effects. This list showed higher rates with 
ceftolozane/tazobactam in both studies for headache, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain and 
AST/ALT increased.  
An additional review of AESIs was conducted. Anaphylaxis and haemolytic disorders were not observed 
with ceftolozane/tazobactam in Phase 3 studies. 
o  Eleven (1.1%) ceftolozane/tazobactam and 8 (0.8%) comparator patients had acute renal failure 
reported  but  only  one  per  treatment  group  was  considered  drug-related.  The  PTs  revealed  that 
renal impairment was reported in 6 vs. 3 and (acute) renal failure in 4 vs. 1 in respective groups.  
o  PMC was reported for 0.4% (n=4) ceftolozane/tazobactam and 0.3% (n=3) comparator patients. 
The 4 in ceftolozane/tazobactam patients were of moderate severity but 3 were SAEs. 
o  Eight  ceftolozane/tazobactam  (0.8%)  and  11  (1.1%)  comparator  patients  had  at  least  1 
thrombophlebitis  TEAE  and  these  were  considered  drug-related  in  3  vs.  6  cases.  All 
thrombophlebitis events were mild or moderate in severity. 
In the Phase 3 studies 7 AEs of rash were reported in ceftolozane/tazobactam patients and 5 in the 
comparator groups. None was serious, 10/12 were mild in severity and one rash per treatment group 
was of moderate severity. In all cases, the rashes began after multiple days of exposure to study drug. 
In ceftolozane/tazobactam patients the time to onset was between day 3 and day 6. No action was 
taken with study drug for any of the rashes in ceftolozane/tazobactam patients but treatment was 
required in 4 cases in each treatment group.   
Further explorations of the database did not suggest higher rates of AEs for ceftolozane vs. 
comparators in subgroups such as those with renal impairment of the elderly.

In Phase 3 studies there were 12 deaths in ceftolozane/tazobactam patients and 8 in comparator 
patients, most (11 vs. 8) of which occurred in the cIAI study. Seven subjects died while on study 
therapy or within 24 h of termination of study drug. None was considered related to study drug. The 
causes of death in the ceftolozane/ tazobactam group were pneumonia, multi-organ failure (3), 
obstructive renal failure, cardiac failure (2), myocardial infarction and sudden death (2). In the 
meropenem group the causes of death were infection (of skin graft on amputated leg), circulatory 
collapse, road traffic accident, septic shock (2), pulmonary embolism and cardiac insufficiency and 
myocardial infarction.  
SAEs 
There was a higher incidence of SAEs in the cIAI indication but within each study there were no 
obvious differences between treatments. In the cUTI study C. difficile colitis and PMC in 
ceftolozane/tazobactam patients were considered drug-related. In the cIAI study 10 and 12 SAEs were 
associated with clinical failure and two cases (one per group) of C. difficile colitis were considered 
drug-related.

Laboratory findings 
In Phase 3 studies, shifts in haematology findings of 2 or more grades from baseline to any post-
baseline assessment were observed for 11% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 8% in the 
comparator group. In Phase 3 two ceftolozane/tazobactam patients seroconverted from a negative to 
positive Coombs’ test at the EOT visit but there were no findings to indicate haemolytic anaemia. 
Additional cases occurred in Phase 1 and 2 studies but without findings indicative of haemolytic 
anaemia. 
Shifts in chemistry findings of 2 or more grades from baseline to any post-baseline assessment were 
observed at comparable rates between treatments. Shifts from Grade 0, 1 or 2 at baseline to a worst 
value post-baseline of Grade 3 or 4 were generally uncommon for chemistry parameters. In the cIAI 
indication, shifts to Grade 3 or 4 were most commonly observed for GGT (9% ceftolozane/tazobactam 
vs. 13% meropenem), low phosphate (4% vs. 7%) and increased AST (3% vs. 2%). 
The incidence of ALT or AST elevations >3×ULN was low at ~1% for both treatments across studies. 
The incidence of hepatic enzyme elevations >3×ULN in the cIAI study was 2% for 
ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. <1% for meropenem. One subject in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group 
met the criteria for Hy’s law on study Day 3 but also met the criteria at screening and values declined 
while on therapy. In the Phase 2 study in cIAI one subject with cholecystitis in the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam group met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s law during treatment (Day 2). The 
patient had a baseline elevation in ALT, AST and total bilirubin and levels declined during continued 
treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam. 
In the Phase 3 studies the applicant’s review of AESIs revealed that 11 (1.1%) ceftolozane/tazobactam 
patients and 8 (0.8%) comparator patients had acute renal failure reported but only one per treatment 
group was considered drug-related. The PTs revealed that renal impairment was reported in 6 vs. 3 
and (acute) renal failure was reported in 4 vs. 1 in respective groups. At TOC the data indicate that 15 
patients with a normal baseline level had Grade 1, 2 or 4 elevations at TOC while two had an increase 
from Grade 1 to 2. For the pooled comparators, there were 19 patients with shifts from normal 
baseline to Grade 1 (16) or 2 (3) elevations at TOC.

Gender 
There was no relevant gender difference in the incidence or types of TEAS, SAEs or events leading to 
discontinuation.

Age 
In Phase 3 studies 250 ceftolozane/tazobactam patients were aged ≥ 65 years and 113 were ≥ 75 
years.  Generally and in both treatment groups the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, discontinuations due to 
TEAEs and deaths tended to be higher among those aged > 65 years and for those aged >75 vs. 65-
74 years. Types of events that were more commonly reported in the elderly were spread across 
several SOCs and no qualitative difference in the AE profile was identified in the elderly population. 
Race 
As approximately 90% were White and predominantly Eastern European, a meaningful analysis of 
racial differences is not possible. 
BMI 
In Phase 3 studies 484/2047 (24%) had BMI ≥30 kg/m2. There was no relevant difference in the 
incidence of individual TEAEs reported between the BMI subgroups. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Phase 3 studies 20 patients per treatment group discontinued study drug because of TEAEs. Those 
TEAEs triggering discontinuation that occurred in more than one patient are shown below.

Table 48 
The 5 patients who discontinued ceftolozane/tazobactam because of renal impairment/renal failure had 
at least mild renal impairment at baseline. The protocol required subjects to discontinue therapy if 
CRCL decreased below 30 mL/min while on therapy. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 2076 subjects were randomised into the Phase 3 studies, including 1083 in the cUTI 
indication and 993 in the cIAI indication; 2047 (99%) of these subjects were treated with study drug 
and are included in the Safety population. Overall in the integrated analysis, 1015 subjects (49.6%) 
were treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam (with or without metronidazole) and 1032 (50.4%) were 
treated with a comparator. Across the two Phase 2 studies, a total of 251 subjects were randomised 
and 248 subjects received study drug (167 received ceftolozane or ceftolozane/tazobactam). The 
majority of treated subjects completed study participation (95%) and completed study drug treatment 
(86%). Across the 9 Phase 1 studies, a total of 305 subjects were enrolled and received study drug. 
The majority of treated subjects completed study drug (98%). In all studies, there was no notable 
difference between treatment arms in the study completion rates. Overall, the extent of exposure to 
study therapy was similar between subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator treatment 
arms. Although the treatment regimens were different between the 2 indications, the median duration 
of therapy was similar in both (6.7 days in the cUTI indication and 6.2 days in the cIAI indication). 
Ceftolozane/tazobactam was administered as a single dose up to 4.5 g and multiple doses up to 9 g 
daily for up to 10 days in the Phase 3 studies. The applicant is asked to compare the number and types 
of the AEs in patients who were treated until one week versus 7-14 days. 
The number of patients with the target indications, exposed to ceftolozane/tazobactam at the 
recommended dosage is considered acceptable to adequately evaluate the safety profile.    
In the integrated Phase 3 analysis, the majority of subjects were White/Caucasian and from Eastern 
Europe, more than half (56%) of all subjects were female, and the median age was 51 to 52 years. 
Overall, 24% of subjects were elderly (≥65 years of age) and 56 (11.8 %) of these patients in the ITT 
population were ≥75 years. There is limited clinical data on the use of ceftolozane/tazobactam in 
elderly patients > 75 year.  
In the cUTI indication, 70% of subjects were female and in the cIAI 59% of the patients were male. 
Overall, there was no major imbalance in demographic characteristics between ceftolozane/tazobactam 
and levofloxacin and meropenem groups. 
Most TEAEs for ceftolozane/tazobactam were of mild to moderate severity. Overall, the prevalence of 
TEAEs was comparable and almost similar for the study drug versus comparators.

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arms in 
the phase 3 studies were typical for hospitalized subjects treated with cephalosporins and included 
nausea (5.2%), diarrhea (3.9%), constipation (3.0%), vomiting (2.2%), pyrexia (3.3%), headache 
(4.2%), insomnia (2.4%), and transaminase increases (ALT 1.%, AST 1.4%). Based on the available 
data, the applicant has included adequate information regarding most of these adverse events and the 
frequencies for each event for the intended dosage recommendation in SmPC 4.8. 
The TEAEs for the comparators in the integrated phase 3 cUTI and cIAI were as follow: nausea (3.7%), 
diarrhea (4.7%), constipation (2.2%), vomiting (2.5%), pyrexia (2.3%), headache (3.4%), insomnia 
(2.4%), and transaminase increases (ALT 1.0%, AST 0.8%). Generally, there are similar TEAEs with 
similar prevalence when comparing drug study versus comparator. 
In the integrated Phase 3 studies, 12 subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam treatment arm and 8 
subjects (including one in road traffic accident) in the comparator treatment arm died during or shortly 
after treatment. Except for one, all deaths were in cIAI patients as was to be expected considering the 
increased severity of cIAIs compared with cUTIs. Most of the patients who died were ≥ 65 years (9 in 
ceftolozane vs 4 in meropenem).  
The incidence of SAEs was similar in the integrated ceftolozane/tazobactam treatment arm (54 
subjects, 5.3%) and the comparator treatment arm (54 subjects, 5.2%). There was a higher incidence 
of SAEs in the cIAI indication consistent with the severity of the disease and surgical intervention. Most 
SAEs were single events and were most commonly reported in the Infections and Infestations SOC, 
like urinary tract infections (0.4%), abdominal abscess (0.3%), and septic shock (0.3%). The applicant 
is asked to discuss the causative bacteria and the resistance profiles involved in the infections and 
infestations in the ceftolozane/tazobactam groups. Overall, the incidence of other SAEs was low and 
balanced across treatment arms in the clinical programme.  
No haemolytic disorders were reported and no subject treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam in the 
integrated Phase 3 studies experienced an anaphylactic reaction. Memberanous colitis, including 
incidence of events related to C. difficile, potential for thrombophlebitis or infusion-related TEAEs, and 
renal toxicity with ceftolozane/tazobactam therapy are considered low and comparable between 
ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator groups.   
There were no significant changes at baseline and post-baseline in any of the laboratory parameters. 
In total one subject in the Phase 3 studies (treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam) was identified as 
fulfilling the criteria for Hy’s law. According to the inclusion criteria for the study, subjects with high 
transaminases values should not be included in the study. There is no data suggesting that the 
hepatotoxicity is related to treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam. In the Phase 2 study CXA-IAI-10-
01 (cIAI), one subject in the ceftolozane/tazobactam treatment arm met the criteria for Hy’s law 
during the treatment period (Day 2). Again, there are no data which indicate that the hepatotoxicity is 
related to treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam.  
The incidence of elevation of both ALT and in particular AST was higher in the ceftolozane/tazobactam 
than the comparator arms. This issue has been adequately reflected in the SmPC Section 4.8. There is 
no evidence for an increased risk of hepatotoxicity related to treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam 
from the presented data. The changes for other chemistry parameters are low and comparable 
between the study drug and the comparators.   
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful changes in systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, and 
temperature from baseline ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator treatment arms. The TQT study 
was negative, with no findings indicating an effect of ceftolozane/tazobactam on cardiac repolarisation.

The types of events that were more commonly reported in elderly subjects in cIAI included events in 
the General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, Cardiac Disorders, Metabolism and 
Nutritional Disorders, Renal and Urinary Disorders, Vascular Disorders, and Psychiatric Disorders SOCs. 
The applicant is asked to specify the TEAEs within each event. 
Overall, 494 (24%) of the 2047 subjects in the integrated analyses were ≥65 years of age providing 
an adequate sample for analysis of safety in the elderly. Slightly more adverse events are observed in 
older subjects with cIAI, which could be reflective of the nature of the indication and their physiological 
status.  
No notable differences across treatment arms were observed between male and female subjects and 
subjects with high and normal BMI in the overall incidence or types of TEAEs. Analysis of TEAEs by 
race revealed no consistent differences across treatment arms in the integrated Phase 3 studies 
between White, Black/African American, Asian, or other subjects. Results of the analysis of TEAEs by 
race were similar between treatment arms and in both indications. However, as approximately 90% of 
subjects in both treatment arms were White and predominantly Eastern European, the widespread 
applicability of the results of this analysis is somewhat limited.  
In the Phase 3 studies, the types of events that were more commonly reported in subjects with 
moderate renal impairment at baseline compared with those with normal renal function or mild 
impairment were distributed across multiple body systems. In the Phase 1 study CXA-101-02, the 
incidence of TEAEs was 4 of 6 (67%) subjects with mild renal impairment and 1 of 6 (17%) subjects 
with normal renal function. TEAE in these patient groups have been presented on System Organ Class 
(SOC).  
Based on the clinical and non-clinical evaluations, the potential for clinically relevant Drug-Drug 
Interactions (DDIs) with ceftolozane/tazobactam is considered low. 
Overall, in the Phase 3 studies discontinuations of study drug due to TEAEs were similar between 
treatment arms; 20 (2.0%) vs 20 (1.9%) subjects. Discontinuation was also low and comparable 
between the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm and the comparator arms in the submitted Phase 2 studies. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
A dose or exposure relationship to safety could not be identified for ceftolozane/tazobactam as all 
patients received the same dose and plasma exposures were not measured in Phase 3.  
The Phase 3 studies do not suggest a marked difference in the safety profile between 
ceftolozane/tazobactam and respective comparators within each of the two indications but there were 
some differences in rates. In particular, reporting rates were consistently higher with 
ceftolozane/tazobactam in both indications for nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, pyrexia, 
headache, hypotension, hypokalaemia and for each of ALT and AST increased.  
A positive Coombs test was recorded in a number of patients, although there was no evidence of 
associated haemolytic anaemia. There are no major concerns raised by the small difference in numbers 
of deaths or by the distribution of numbers and types of SAEs. 
The overall reported rate of transaminase abnormalities was higher for ceftolozane/tazobactam but the 
differences were not marked. Although two patients have met Hy’s law criteria it seems unlikely that 
CHMP assessment report

either case was directly due to ceftolozane/tazobactam. There was an imbalance in renal TEAEs, which 
in most cases seem to reflect changes in serum creatinine. 
There are no major concerns regarding safety.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.    
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
Given the small size of the vial label and the fact that the product is to be administered by healthcare 
professionals only (Art. 63.3), the QRD Group has accepted the request to have only the minimum 
particulars displayed on the vial label with the following comments: 
- Short term for the pharmaceutical form should be “Powder for concentrate” 
- The route of administration should be “For IV use after reconstitution and dilution”. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Zerbaxa (ceftolozane / tazobactam) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam was evaluated in two Phase 3 studies, each of which was 
formed by merging of two initial studies in two types of infection. The overall pre-defined primary 
analyses in each study demonstrated non-inferiority for ceftolozane/tazobactam against selected 
comparative regimens

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Ceftolozane has been developed only in a FDC. To justify this presentation it is essential that the 
tazobactam dose is considered adequate to protect ceftolozane from hydrolysis by beta-lactamases 
potentially within the inhibitory range of tazobactam. The clinical data alone do not support such a 
conclusion due to the nature of the indications studied (i.e., cIAI in which surgery plays a major 
therapeutic role; UTI being the easiest to treat due to high urinary levels of ceftolozane and 
tazobactam) and the limited range of beta-lactamases that were produced by the patient isolates. 
Therefore the final conclusion on the adequacy of the tazobactam dose to treat a broad range of beta-
lactamase-producing organisms rests on the non-clinical evidence to support the sufficiency of 0.5 g 
q8h when used in conjunction with ceftolozane. This matter was investigated further during the 
application procedure with a final conclusion that the dose is likely adequate for most Class A enzymes 
within the range of tazobactam but it may not suffice even for these enzymes if they are hyper-
produced. Additional text was drafted for section 5.1 of SmPC to convey these limitations. 
The Addendum to Guideline CPMP/EWP/558/95 Rev 2 states that it is preferable to evaluate efficacy 
against cUTI and acute pyelonephritis in separate studies. If they are evaluated in the same study then 
stratification at randomisation with capping of the proportion with pyelonephritis is recommended. In 
the applicant’s UTI study, 82% in the ME population had pyelonephritis. This is then reflected in the 
population demographics. For example, in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group with pyelonephritis 81% 
of patients were female, 81% were 18-65 years and 66% had normal renal function whereas in the 
small group with cUTI 72% were male, 53% were aged 18-65 years and 43% had normal renal 
function.  
Within the pyelonephritis sub-population ceftolozane/tazobactam was non-inferior to levofloxacin. In 
the small numbers of patients with cUTI the success rates numerically favoured 
ceftolozane/tazobactam, even after excluding cases due to organisms that were resistant to 
levofloxacin, but no conclusions can be drawn regarding non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. 
levofloxacin. 
In light of the doubt regarding the dose of tazobactam, it is important to note that eradication rates in 
urine were impacted by the presence of certain beta-lactamases despite the anticipated high drug 
concentrations predicted in the urinary tract. It is clear that some of these beta-lactamases are not 
within the range of inhibition of tazobactam. However, in some cases, failure was associated with 
hyper-production of enzymes that could be inhibited by tazobactam subject to a sufficient dose 
regimen. 
In the cIAI study near to half of ITT and CE patients had a primary focus of infection in the appendix 
compared to a maximum of 30% recommended in the Addendum to Guideline CPMP/EWP/558/95 Rev 
2 . The patient demographics, including the low APACHE scores and the fact that half of the total 
patients received 4-7 days therapy, reflect the predominant underlying diagnosis. Therefore the study 
population was not adequately representative of the range of infections encompassed under the cIAI 
indication.  
Added to the concerns is that point estimate cure rates were numerically lower for 
ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in those with APACHE scores > 10 (most of whom had non-
appendiceal primary infection), in patients aged > 65 years (in whom the primary site of infection was 
more often the bowel) and in those with multiple abscess or diffuse peritonitis. Correlating with these 
findings, the failures in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group were more likely to be elderly subjects 
(44.2% of ceftolozane failures vs. 27.1% meropenem failures), have peritonitis (76.6% vs. 64.3%) 
and have had a laparotomy (64.9% vs. 48.6%). These results in subgroups contributed to a fairly 
consistent numerical inferiority for ceftolozane/tazobactam vs. meropenem despite the fact the primary 
analysis demonstrated non-inferiority according to the pre-defined criteria.  
CHMP assessment report

Thus, the populations studied did not meet the CHMP expectations as laid down in the “Addendum to 
Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections 
(CPMP/EWP/558/95 Rev 2)” and for cUTI and intra-abdominal infections the data are still considered to 
be suboptimal. However, these indications have been accepted by CHMP, subject to adequate 
reflection of the limitations of these data in the SmPC.  
In addition, in both indications cure rates tended to be lower in those with moderate renal impairment 
at baseline. This observation affected both treatment groups. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to 
recommend frequent monitoring of renal function in those with moderate renal impairment at baseline 
so that prompt dose adjustments may be made in case of rapid recovery in renal function during 
treatment. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Ceftolozane/tazobactam appears to be associated with TEAEs that are typical and expected of beta-
lactam agents. There are no additional signals of major concern at this time to suggest that the FDC 
would be associated with additional and unexpected risk for these types of agents. 
The Phase 3 studies compared ceftolozane/tazobactam with levofloxacin or meropenem. Although 
there was not a marked difference in the safety profile between ceftolozane/tazobactam and respective 
comparators the AE reporting rates were consistently higher with ceftolozane/tazobactam in both 
indications for nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, pyrexia, headache, hypotension, hypokalaemia 
and for each of ALT and AST increased. Most of these AEs also figured among events considered drug-
related by investigators and identified in the applicant’s review of the database for likely ADRs.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The overall reported rate of transaminase abnormalities was higher for ceftolozane/tazobactam but the 
differences were not marked. Although two patients have met Hy’s law criteria it seems unlikely that 
either case was directly due to ceftolozane/tazobactam. There was also an imbalance in renal TEAEs, 
which in most cases seem to reflect changes in serum creatinine but the differences were not so 
marked as to represent a major concern. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Ceftolozane/tazobactam combines a new beta-lactam with an old inhibitor that has severe limitations 
in its range of beta-lactamase inhibition. However, at the right dose, tazobactam may serve to protect 
ceftolozane from some ESBLs that could otherwise hydrolyse the beta-lactam.  
Ceftolozane itself may have some utility in treating a small number of P. aeruginosa that are resistant 
to several other agents via specific mechanisms but tazobactam does not influence the activity of 
ceftolozane against such strains.  
It is important that the specific infection types which have been studied and hence the limitations of 
the data are adequately reflected in the SmPC.

Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Ceftolozane is a semisynthetic, parenteral antibacterial agent of the cephalosporin class with the usual 
mechanism of bactericidal activity of the beta-lactams. The spectrum of activity of ceftolozane includes 
enterobacteria, several non-fermenters, fastidious Gram-negative organisms, some streptococci and a 
few selected anaerobes. Ceftolozane alone is stable in the presence of those beta-lactamases that 
generally do not hydrolyse cephalosporins (such as TEM-1) but it is readily hydrolysed by a wide range 
of ESBLs and by AmpC enzymes produced by some genera, such as Enterobacter spp. It is unusual for 
its relative stability in the presence of pseudomonal AmpC enzymes. Also, it is not affected by loss of 
OprD by P. aeruginosa and it is a poor substrate for pseudomonal efflux pumps.  
Ceftolozane represents a new active substance. It has been developed for clinical use only as part of a 
FDC presentation with a beta-lactamase inhibitor (tazobactam) that has been on the market (as part of 
a FDC with piperacillin) since the early 1990s.  
Tazobactam acid is a penicillanic acid sulfone derivative which can inhibit a range of bacterial class A 
and some class C β-lactamases. Tazobactam can potentially protect ceftolozane from hydrolysis by 
some beta-lactamases, broadening its spectrum to include a range of ESBL-producing E. coli, K. 
pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae. However, tazobactam does not have useful inhibitory 
activity against many problematic beta-lactamases, such as several of the class C enzymes, the 
carbapenemases (serine-based and metallo-enzymes) or Class D enzymes.   
Based on single pivotal studies, the CHMP accepts Zerbaxa for treatment of the following infections in 
adults: 
- 
- 
- 
Complicated intra-abdominal infections (see section 4.4); 
Acute pyelonephritis; 
Complicated urinary tract infections (see section 4.4). 
at an agreed posology of 1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam q8h for a fixed duration of 7 days in 
cUTI and acute pyelonephritis and a range from 4-14 days in cIAI, with caveat of dose adjustment in 
case of moderate or severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis. The 
Product Information describes the limitations of the data supporting cUTI and cIAI indications (see 
section 4.4 SmPC). 
Although PK-PD justification for the tazobactam dose was not robust, data suggests that provided the 
susceptibility breakpoint for enterobacteria is no more than 1 mg/L, the tazobactam dose may suffice 
to cover the majority of the common Class A enzymes.  
Ceftolozane/tazobactam appears to be associated with TEAES that are typical and expected of beta-
lactam agents. There are no additional signals of major concern at this time to suggest that the FDC 
would be associated with additional and unexpected risk for these types of agents.

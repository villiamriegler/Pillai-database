2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This marketing authorisation application for Entacapone Orion (entacapone) has been submitted by 
Orion Corporation as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended. 
The MAH (Orion Corporation) for Comtess, which was authorised on 16 September 1998, provided 
consent to make use of the pharmaceutical, non-clinical and clinical documentation of the initial dossier 
of this authorised product and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and 
approved. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Entacapone Orion medicinal product are identical 
to  the  up-to-date  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  profile  of  Comtess.  The  application  for  Entacapone 
Orion  concerns  the  identical  strengths  and  pack  sizes  to  those  approved  for  Comtess  and  consists  of 
only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found in the Comtess CHMP assessment 
reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website.   
The approved indication is: 
“Entacapone is indicated as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/benserazide or 
levodopa/carbidopa for use in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor 
fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.” 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Comtess application, the quality data in support of 
the  Entacapone  Orion  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality  data  of  the  Comtess  dossier, 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Comtess  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in 
support  of  the  Entacapone  Orion  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the 
Comtess dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
The ERA provided for this application consists of an adequate justification for the absence of specific 
study data. The medicinal product subject to this application is intended to be administered at 
comparable dose levels and for indications that are already approved in the European Community for 
Comtess. Based on the assumption that the product is intended to substitute for identical products on 
Entacapone Orion 
Assessment report

the market, the approval of the referred product should not result in an increase of the total quantity 
of the active ingredients released in to the environment. Therefore, it should not result in an increase 
of risk to the environment during storage, distribution, use and disposal. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Comtess application, the clinical data in support of 
the Entacapone Orion application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Comtess dossier, 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP did not require the applicant to submit a risk management plan because the safety profile of 
the medicinal product subject to this application is well established, and no safety concerns requiring 
risk minimisation activities have been identified for Comtess. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance 
was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
2.6.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
The Package Leaflet of Comtess has been successfully user tested in the framework of variation 
EMEA/H/C/0170/II/0043/G for which the CHMP opinion was adopted on 22 April 2010. Since the 
proposed Package Leaflet for the current application is identical to the Package Leaflet for Comtess 
except for the product-specific information, no further testing is warranted. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Since this application has been submitted by Orion Corporation as an informed consent application to 
Comtess in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the CHMP considered 
that the benefit-risk balance of Entacapone Orion 200 mg film-coated tablets was favourable and 
therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication: 
“Entacapone is indicated as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/benserazide or 
levodopa/carbidopa for use in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor 
fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.” 
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Entacapone Orion in the treatment of Parkinson’s diseases is favourable

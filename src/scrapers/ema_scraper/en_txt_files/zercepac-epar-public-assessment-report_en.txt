2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20 %-30 % of primary breast cancers. Studies 
of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) have shown that there is a broad variation of 
HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8 % to 34.0 % for IHC and 7.1 % to 42.6 % for FISH. Studies indicate that breast 
cancer patients whose tumours overexpress HER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients 
whose tumours do not overexpress HER2. The extracellular domain of the receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into 
the blood stream and measured in serum samples. 
Trastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane region of HER2’s 
extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 signalling and prevents 
the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism of HER2. As a result, trastuzumab 
has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that 
overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 
overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is currently authorised for the treatment of breast cancer and gastric cancer. Herceptin 
is available as a 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion for intravenous (IV) use and as a 600 
mg solution for injection (SC) for subcutaneous use (EPAR Herceptin). 
Zercepac (HLX02) has been developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Herceptin.  The proposed 
indications of HLX02 are the same as those currently authorised for the reference medicinal product Herceptin 
(see section 1.1):  
•  Treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC),  
•  Treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC),  
•  Treatment in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin of adult patients with 
HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction who have not 
received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease.  
The posology and method of administration are the same as the ones approved for Herceptin 150 mg powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion. The applicant did not claim subcutaneous use. 
Zercepac intravenous formulation is not intended for subcutaneous administration and should be administered 
via an intravenous infusion only. It contains 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Zercepac (company code HLX02) is developed as a similar biological medicinal product (biosimilar) to the 
Reference Medicinal Product (RMP) Herceptin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 12/153 
 
  
  
 
 
The finished product is presented as a sterile lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
containing 150 mg of trastuzumab as active substance. The reconstituted Zercepac solution contains 21 mg/mL 
of trastuzumab. Other ingredients are L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, L-histidine, α, α-trehalose 
dihydrate and polysorbate 20. 
The product is available in a 20 mL clear glass type I vial with bromobutyl rubber stopper.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
HLX02 is a humanised recombinant anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cells. It is comprised of the constant region of human IgG1 kappa and the humanised variable region of 
murine anti-HER2 antibody. HLX02 is a disulphide bond-linked tetramer consisting of two identical 450-aa 
glycosylated heavy chains (HC) and two identical 214-aa kappa light chains (LC), with a molecular weight 
around 145 kDa before N-linked glycosylation. The antibody contains 4 pairs of interchain and 12 pairs of 
intrachain disulfide bonds, and 1 N-linked glycosylation site at N300 of each HC.  
Trastuzumab binds to Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 protein (HER2) that is overexpressed in breast 
cancer cells. The mechanism of action of trastuzumab is known to be its inhibition of proliferation of human 
tumor cells that overexpress HER2.  
The antibody presents high affinity and specificity binding activity to sub-domain IV of HER2´s extracellular 
domain, anti-proliferation activity against HER2-positive carcinoma cells and antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HER2-positive carcinoma cells. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
The active substance is manufactured at Shanghai Henlius Biopharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process for the active substance uses a recombinant CHO cell line that contains the DNA 
coding sequence for trastuzumab. The active substance manufacturing process includes 1) an upstream cell 
culture process, consisting on cell expansions and a final cell culture in a Bioreactor a downstream purification 
process, consisting on several chromatographic steps and filtrations. The active substance manufacturing 
process is well described in the dossier, including flow charts summarizing all process steps. 
Information regarding media compositions, buffers and reagents used in cell cultures is presented, as well as 
composition of resins for the chromatographic columns and filters characteristics. Information on the storage 
conditions and lifetime of the different columns used during purification has been provided. 
In-process controls (IPCs) are established at all steps of manufacture 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 13/153 
 
  
  
 
 
Control of materials  
The Applicant has listed the raw materials used during the manufacturing of HLX02 active substance. 
Certificates of analysis for raw materials are provided and quality controls of materials not conforming to Ph. 
Eur. grade are presented in the dossier.  
Materials of animal origin were used only during early stages of cell line development and a TSE risk assessment 
has been provided. Information on the qualitative composition media used has been provided.  
The Applicant has provided complete information on the bioreactors and bioreactor bags used for active 
substance manufacture. In addition, extractable studies on the bags have been conducted and the results 
confirm a low risk. 
Regarding generation of the producer cell line, the Applicant has provided information on the amino acid 
sequences used to express the HLX02 monoclonal antibody. Information concerning the parental cell line source 
is provided. Expression vectors, cloning strategy, transfection method and development of the producer cell line 
are adequately described in the dossier. Clone selection steps are described and data demonstrating the 
clonality of the cell bank are presented. 
Cell bank preparation and establishment are adequately described in the dossier. Characterisation of the Master 
Cell Bank (MCB) and the Working Cell Bank (WCB) has been performed. An End of production cell bank (EOPC) 
has been established to evaluate the stability of the producer cell line and to determine the limit of the in vitro 
cell age. EOPC has been adequately characterized and several tests have been performed to analyse cell 
substrate stability. 
Finally, any future WCB will be established according to the description of the current WCB. Regarding the 
characterisation, a future WCB will be tested similarly as the current WCB for the parameters identity, viability, 
sterility and bacteriostasis/fungistasis, Mycoplasma, in vitro adventitious viruses and in vivo assay for viral 
contaminants.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
The Applicant has determined critical steps and key parameters to control the robustness and reproducibility of 
the active substance manufacture. Specifications and their acceptance criteria for in-process controls 
(IPCs)/intermediates have been established. A description of the analytical methods used for IPCs testing and 
their validation reports are presented in the dossier. 
Process validation and/or evaluation  
A prospective process validation with a sufficient number of consecutive batches has been performed. To 
accomplish process validation, a panel of controls have been used, including manufacturing process parameters, 
in-process monitoring and active substance batch release. 
In general, the analysis performed and data provided support that the process is well established and robust 
enough to yield a consistent product. Impurities clearance has also been validated and, after purification, 
impurity levels for the validation batches met acceptance criteria for the active substance. Furthermore, hold 
times and hold conditions for process intermediates in the purification process have been adequately justified.  
Lifetime studies for the three chromatographic resins and UF/DF filter have been carried out at small scale and 
the proposed lifetimes for commercial manufacturing are considered acceptable. The proposed lifetimes will be 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 14/153 
 
  
  
 
verified during the continued process verification. A protocol for the qualification of the proposed lifetimes at 
manufacturing scale has been provided. 
Manufacturing Process Development  
From the initial non-clinical to the clinical material manufactured for the Phase III study and finally to the 
commercial material, the Applicant states continuous efforts have been made to improve product quality, 
especially biosimilarity and process performance. Several manufacturing processes have been defined for the 
manufacturing process development. 
The comparability studies performed between the materials manufactured with the different manufacturing 
processes are considered adequate.  
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) were identified. The Applicant has provided satisfactory information related to 
the approach to define the CQAs. Impact and uncertainty definitions and scores for QAs have been justified 
based on the impact on biological function, PK and immunogenicity and safety. Scores assigned to CQAs have 
been based on regulatory requirements, product experience and previous knowledge. 
Anticipated ranges for CQAs to meet biosimilarity requirements were established based on a combination of 
clinical experience, non-clinical studies, laboratory studies, prior knowledge and regulatory requirements. 
A study has been performed to evaluate the impact of process parameter variations (critical process parameters 
(CPPs) and key process parameters (KPPs)) on the quality attributes and ensure the control strategy is 
appropriate to achieve the intended quality of the active substance. A risk assessment has been performed to 
identify key performance attributes and CQAs.  
Based on the clinical and pharmacokinetic as well as the physicochemical characteristics of trastuzumab, a 
quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined. A major objection was raised as frozen samples had been used 
to establish the QTPP. To demonstrate that the reconstitution and frozen storage at -80°C does not impact the 
quality of the samples additional data was provided and the major objection was adequately addressed. 
Characterisation  
A comprehensive characterisation study has been performed.  
Characterisation studies include the assessment of several quality attributes classified into two categories: 
physicochemical characterisation and functional assays. The physicochemical characterisation includes tests to 
determine the primary structure (amino acid sequence, molecular weight, disulphide linkages, glycosylation 
site, post-translational modifications and free thiols), higher order structure, charge variants and isoelectric 
point, glycosylation and size variants. The functional assays include tests to determine the immunochemical 
properties and bioactivity (anti-proliferation, ADCC, and apoptosis by cell-based assay and HER2 target binding 
by ELISA and SPR). 
Process-related impurities include Protein A, insulin, host cell protein (HCP), and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). 
They are controlled in the active substance release specification and their removal has been successfully 
demonstrated on the process validation batches.  
In addition, the removal of other impurities was also studied during the active substance process validation. A 
safety evaluation of these impurities was carried out based on the impurity safety factor (ISF).

In conclusion, the information provided in characterisation is considered acceptable and described in sufficient 
detail. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure 
The specifications have been set in accordance with ICH Q6B and cover tests for identity, appearance, general 
tests, quantitation, purity, potency, impurities and microbial contamination. 
Analytical methods 
The active substance is tested using a combination of non-compendial and compendial methods. For 
non-compendial test methods, descriptions of the test procedures including samples preparation, procedures 
and system suitability criteria are provided. For the compendial test methods  relevant pharmacopoeial 
references are given. 
Analytical methods developed in house were appropriately validated according to ICH Q2, and pharmacopoeial 
methods were verified based on the Ph. Eur. monographs. Validation reports are provided. 
Biological activity is measured through the analysis of its anti-proliferation activity in a human breast cancer cell 
line over expressing HER2. The Applicant has added also a HER2 binding assay to the active substance release 
specification. The proposed acceptance limits are deemed acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data submitted comply with the active substance specification and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The reference standards have been characterised with respect to primary and higher order structures, 
post-translational modifications, protein content, potency, immune characteristics, purity, physical/chemical 
characteristics and impurities/pollutants. The analytical procedures are described.  
A requalification strategy of reference materials is defined.  
Container closure system 
The active substance is stored in single-use Mobius storage bags. Extractable and leachable studies were 
conducted and analytical results were provided. A safety assessment based on the study results was performed 
to evaluate the potential health risk for patients. All extractables and leachables were present in concentrations 
below their derived permitted daily exposures (PDEs). Therefore, it is agreed that the risk for patients is 
negligible. Suitability of the proposed container closure system for the active substance has been appropriately 
demonstrated. 
Stability 
The proposed shelf-life of the active substance is based on the long-term stability results. 
Stability studies were conducted in accordance with ICH guidelines and analytical methods were stability 
indicating.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The finished product is supplied as a sterile, white to pale yellow, preservative-free, lyophilized powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion in a dosage strength of 150 mg. Before use, the lyophilized finished product 
is reconstituted with 7.2 ml of sterile water for injections yielding a colourless to pale yellow, clear to slightly 
opalescent solution containing 21 mg/ml at pH 6.0. The reconstituted solution is further diluted with sterile 0.9% 
sodium chloride for administration by intravenous infusion. The finished product is supplied in a 20 mL Type I 
borosilicate clear glass vial sealed with a 20 mm bromobutyl rubber lyophilisation stopper and a 20 mm 
aluminium seal with flip-off plastic cap. 
The composition of HLX02 finished product contains L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, L-histidine, α, 
α-Trehalose dihydrate and polysorbate 20 as excipients All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation.  
The finished product has the same dosage form and formulation components as the reference medicinal product 
(RMP), EU Herceptin. No further formulation development was performed. The formulation is appropriate to 
ensure the stability of HLX02 protein, according to stability data.  
The finished product contains a 5% overfill that ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from 
each vial, but no overage was included. 
The Applicant has provided a description of the process development. The finished product manufacturing 
process evolved through different processes to increase robustness and production capacity, and to meet the 
needs of future commercial production. The formulation composition has remained the same throughout 
development.  
The Applicant performed comparability studies between finished product lots used in the phase III clinical study 
and lots from the proposed commercial process. All results obtained were highly similar thereby confirming 
comparability. The information on the process development is sufficiently detailed.  
The Applicant has provided detailed information on the container closure system. The primary packaging 
consists of type I glass vials with rubber stoppers. The glass vials comply with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1, whereas the 
bromobutyl rubber stoppers comply with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. They have been shown to be suitable for storage of the 
finished product, providing a good integrity to reduce the entry of water vapour, oxygen and other 
contamination during the long-term storage, and ensuring the quality of the finished product. Suitability of the 
container closure system has been appropriately demonstrated through a number of studies including 
extractables, leachables, integrity and compatibility with diluent and components used for the preparation of 
product for intravenous administration.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
During the procedure a major objection was raised in relation to the lack of valid GMP certificates for the 
active substance/finished product manufacturing site, one QC site and one importation/batch release site. 
The requested GMP certificates were provided for the manufacturing site and the QC site. The batch release 
and importation site was withdrawn from the application as a valid GMP certificate could not be provided in 
a timely manner. The major objection was thereby considered resolved. 
As the active substance is already formulated, there is no formulation step in the finished product 
manufacturing process. The finished product manufacturing process consists of active substance thawing, 
mixing, sterile filtration, filling and partial stoppering, lyophilisation and full stoppering, capping, visual 
inspection, labelling and packaging.  
Reprocessing is not allowed. No holding times have been proposed. 
An overview of the CPPs and intermediates has been provided. The proposed CPPs, process monitoring 
parameters and IPCs are deemed sufficient to control the finished product manufacturing process.  
The Applicant states that the manufacturing process has undergone continuous improvement and optimisation 
in order to increase production capacity and meet the needs for commercial production with only one major 
revision being a change in lyophiliser during the scale up prior to the phase III clinical trials.  
The acceptable range for total operation time has been justified and maximum times for thawing, mixing, 
sterilising filtration, filling and lyophilisation were specified.  
The manufacturing process has been validated with a sufficient number of consecutive validation batches 
following ICH Q8 (R2). In addition, an enhanced in-process monitoring has been conducted for a comprehensive 
study of product quality and process performance attributes during process validation. Several studies have 
been performed to demonstrate stability of the active substance before and after mixing and homogeneity of 
active substance after mixing. 
Several validation procedures have been successfully performed including lyophilisation process (position 
effect), aseptic filling (media fill simulation studies), sterilisation processes (vials and stoppers), filtration 
(bacteria retention, filter compatibility and product bubble point ratio) and shipping (summer and winter 
scenarios).  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Finished product specifications for release and shelf-life include tests for identity, appearance, reconstitution 
time, visible particles, sub-visible particles, pH after reconstitution, mass variation, osmolality, water content, 
protein content, purity, potency, bacterial endotoxin and sterility. 
For some parameters the same specifications (with identical acceptance limits) are applied for active substance 
and finished product. For quantitative parameters, ranges were set based on mean +/- 3SD of historical data.  
The finished product specifications for release and shelf-life are considered appropriate since they cover all the 
important features of the product and comply with ICH Q6B requirements.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical test methods were appropriately described and non-compendial methods have been validated. 
Analytical procedures common for the active substance and finished product are described in the active 
Assessment report

substance part of the dossier. Analytical procedures specific for the finished product are compendial and have 
been properly verified.  
Method transfer protocols have been provided for all analytical methods. In addition, for the anti-proliferation 
assay, the Applicant has confirmed the successful transfer to the EU lab and provided validation results. This is 
considered acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
An overview of all finished product batches manufactured, and full release testing data were provided. This 
includes process validation batches manufactured according to the final commercial process. The batches were 
in compliance with the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
No additional impurities are introduced by the finished product manufacturing process. The potential presence 
of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH 
Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment it can be concluded that it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. 
Reference standards 
The reference standard used for analysis of the finished product is the same as that used for the active 
substance. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 36 months at 2°C - 8°C is claimed for the finished product. The stability program was designed to 
follow ICH guidelines Q1A (R2) and Q5C.  
Data for up to 36 months under long term storage conditions (2°C - 8°C) are available for lots of finished 
product. The available data shows that the quality attributes remain in conformance with the commercial 
acceptance criteria and supports a shelf life of 36 months at 2°C - 8°C. 
The shelf-life specifications are identical to those applied for release, with the addition of a complementary 
identity and purity test for shelf-life testing. 
A forced degradation study was performed as part of the analytical similarity assessment. The photostability 
study showed that the finished product is sensitive to light. Therefore, the finished product should be stored 
protected from light. 
The in-use stability results demonstrated that the reconstituted solution is stable for 48 hours at 2°C - 8°C, and 
the solution for intravenous infusion (finished product diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride) is stable for 7 days at 
2°C - 8°C and subsequently for 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Zercepac infusion solution should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of 
the user, unless reconstitution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Biosimilarity 
A biosimilarity study has been performed including several batches of HLX02 and EU approved Herceptin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 19/153 
 
  
  
 
Samples used in the generation of the QTPP and the biosimilarity analysis were stored frozen before analysis. 
This raised doubts on whether the quality profile was representative of product stored under approved 
conditions. The Applicant was requested to present further justification to demonstrate that the material used 
could be considered representative of the quality of product stored under approved conditions. This was raised 
as a major objection. Based on additional data provided by the applicant, the major objection was considered 
adequately addressed. Consequently, the results obtained in the biosimilarity exercise can be considered as 
valid.  
The quality attributes included in the biosimilarity study in order to provide a full and comprehensive package of 
information have been classified under the following categories: physicochemical characterisation, functional 
assays, process related impurities (HCP and protein A by ELISA and DNA by qPCR), particles (sub-visible 
particles by MFI and submicron particles by DLS) and forced degradation study (high temperature, illumination, 
acidity, alkalinity, oxidation and shaking). All analytical methods were properly qualified and are deemed 
suitable for the intended purposes.  
Attributes/assays were assigned to one of three 3 tiers based on the potential relevance of each attribute to 
safety and efficacy. The quality attributes were ranked based on the risk assessment principles set out in the ICH 
Quality Guidelines Q8 and Q9.  
The data from the analytical similarity assessment indicate that HLX02 is highly similar to the reference product 
(see Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 below). The amino acid sequence is identical, and primary and higher order 
structures including secondary, tertiary structure are similar. The purity and heterogeneities between HLX02 
and the reference product assessed by SEC, CE-SDS, CEX, icIEF and UPLC-FLR glycan profiling are highly 
similar, with similar profiles of size and charge variants and glycan moieties. Minor differences in relative 
abundance of charge variants and glycan moieties were observed and have been appropriately justified.  
The extinction coefficient (used for protein determination) has been adequately substantiated, in order to assure 
that the absolute amount of protein is correctly determined and the biosimilar contains the amount of protein 
stated on the label claim. 
The forced degradation studies involving high temperature, illumination, acidity, alkalinity, oxidation and 
shaking showed that HLX02 and EU Herceptin had similar degradation behaviours and degradation trends.  
A series of functional assays relevant to the mechanism of action, efficacy and safety were conducted to 
evaluate the biological activity. However, from the description of the ADCC assay it appeared that ADCC had 
been only analysed using an ADCC reporter assay. It was acknowledged that such reporter assays are more 
reproducible compared to classical ADCC assays. However, it was unclear to which extent these ADCC reporter 
assays are representative for ADCC activity in vivo. Therefore, the ADCC reporter assay alone was not 
considered sufficient to conclude on biosimilarity as regards ADCC activity.  
In addition, the sensitivity of the current ADCC assay as performed by the Applicant was questioned. Taken 
together, the issues identified in relation to the ADCC assay were raised as a major objection. 
In response to the major objection, the Applicant provided results from additional ADCC assays. Several lots of 
HLX02 and EU Herceptin were included in these analyses. High similarity in ADCC activity was shown between 
HLX02 and EU Herceptin. The classic ADCC assay used also appeared to be more suitable than the reporter 
ADCC assay to distinguish between Herceptin lots with higher/lower afucosylation levels.  
Taken together, the data provided in response to the major objection are deemed sufficient to confirm that 
HLX02 can be considered as similar to EU Herceptin as regards ADCC activity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 20/153 
 
  
  
 
It is noted that the Applicant has provided extensive biosimilarity data for both EU-sourced and China-sourced 
Herceptin. Whereas the data from China-sourced Herceptin have been taken into consideration, these are 
considered as supportive data only.  
In conclusion, an extensive comparability exercise has been performed between HLX02 and EU Herceptin and 
the results confirm a high level of similarity from a quality point of view.

No materials from human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing process except two materials which 
were used in the first stages during the development of the suspension-adapted CHO cell line. A certificate of 
analysis is presented for these two materials. A TSE certificate is not presented but this is supported by an 
appropriate justification. 
Viral testing results of all cell banks (Research Cell Bank, MCB, WCB and EOPC) and of three batches of 
unprocessed bulk are presented in tabulated form.  
Hepat¡tis E virus was not tested and could, potentially, have been introduced in the cells from the Trypsin-EDTA 
used in the first stages of the cell line development. However, the Applicant presented a risk assessment to 
conclude that the risk for the presence of this virus is negligible. This conclusion is endorsed. 
The effectiveness of the manufacturing process to inactivate/remove viruses has been demonstrated in 
spike-recovery studies of 4 model viruses, Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV), Pseudorabies Virus (PRV), 
Reovirus type 3 (Reo-3), and Minute Virus of Mice (MVM). The effectiveness of inactivation/removal of viruses 
was tested on scaled-down purification steps (Protein A Affinity Chromatography (AC), Low pH Inactivation, 
Cation Exchange Chromatography (CEX), Multimodal Anion Exchange Chromatography (AEX) and Viral 
Filtration (VF)) validated to be representative of the full scale process. Overall, high clearance/inactivation 
factors were observed for all 4 model viruses. 
In conclusion appropriate data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
During the procedure three major objections were raised. The first one related to the lack of valid GMP 
certificates for the active substance/finished product manufacturing site, one QC site and one 
importation/batch release site. The requested GMP certificates were provided for the manufacturing site and 
the QC site. The batch release and importation site was withdrawn from the application as a valid GMP 
certificate could not be provided in a timely manner. Since batch release and importation activities are also 
covered by other sites registered in the dossier (and for which valid GMP certificates are available) the major 
objection could thereby be considered resolved. 
A second major objection related to the use of data in the comparability exercise and for the establishment of the 
QTPP from samples that had been stored frozen. To demonstrate that this does not impact the quality of the 
samples additional data was provided and the major objection was considered adequately addressed. 
The third major objection was in relation to the suitability of the ADCC reporter assay used. In response to the 
major objection, the Applicant provided results from additional ADCC assays. The data provided in response to 
the major objection were deemed appropriate to confirm high similarity between HLX02 and EU Herceptin with 
regard to ADCC activity. 
Overall, an extensive comparability exercise has been performed between HLX02 and EU Herceptin and the 
results confirm a high level of similarity from a quality point of view. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to give reassurance 
on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
has recommended two points for investigation.

The non-clinical data package consisted in in vitro pharmacology studies and an array of in vivo pharmacology 
and toxicology studies. Animal toxicology studies (single and repeat dose), an ex vivo erythrocyte haemolysis 
study and a behavioural safety pharmacology assay were conducted in accordance with the OECD principles of 
GLP according to the applicant.

A summary of the in vitro functionality and binding assays is provided below.  
Table 4: Summary of the functional similarity assays 
In vitro studies were carried out comparing frozen batches of trastuzumab including several batches of HLX02 
against several batches of Herceptin-EU (Herceptin). Data from several China-sourced Herceptin 
(Herceptin-CN) lots were also analysed. HLX02 batches were manufactured from two different manufacturing 
processes.

HER2 binding by ELISA 
Soluble HER2 binding was first assessed by using an ELISA assay. Recombinant human soluble HER2 was coated 
onto the wells of a microtiter ELISA plate, a dose titration of HLX02 was applied as a test sample, and binding 
was detected using an anti-human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Relative receptor binding 
activities were calculated based on the ratio of EC50 values (the effective dose at which 50% inhibition is 
observed) of the reference standard curve relative to the test sample.  
Table 5: Statistical analysis results of soluble HER2 binding by ELISA for HLX02 and Herceptin-EU  
Figure 1: Soluble HER2 binding and statistical analysis results for HLX02 and Herceptin-EU 
Binding kinetics to Soluble HER2 by SPR 
The aim of the assay was to determine the potency using a suitable HER2 protein in a SPR Assay with 1:1 binding 
evaluation model. In the study, it was performed a measurement and comparison of the kinetic parameters of 
the Sample HER2-affinity with that of the Reference HER2-affinity by measurement of the binding capacity with 
HER2 of IgG bases on Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).

Anti-proliferation (cell-based assay) 
Overexpression of the HER2 receptor promotes cell growth, proliferation, survival, and migration. Binding to 
HER2 and has a direct inhibitory effect on proliferation of HER2-overexpressing cells through multiple pathways. 
Evaluation of functional activity was measured in vitro for HLX02/Herceptin using the HER2- overexpressing 
BT-474 cell line. Relative Anti-proliferation activities are calculated based on the ratio of EC50 values.  
Table 7: Statistical analysis results of Anti-proliferation for HLX02 and Herceptin-EU 
Figure 3: Anti-proliferation and statistical analysis results for HLX02 and Herceptin-EU 
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
Two different ADCC assays were conducted. The first approach employed a human breast cancer cell line 
overexpressing HER2 (BT-474) as target cells and CD16a cells (engineered Jurkat effector cells), stably 
transfected with human FcγRIIIa (158V), as effector cells. Relative ADCC activities were calculated based on the 
ratio of EC50 values.  
The second assay, a classic assay based on NK cells, was conducted with BT-474 as target cells and NK92-CD16 
as effector cells, expressing FcγRIIIa V/F. Activities were calculated as mentioned above.

Apoptosis 
The apoptosis assay, a secondary mechanism of action, was performed using a cell-based assay that employed 
a human breast cancer cell line overexpressing HER2 (BT-474) as target cells, and a dose titration of HLX02 is 
applied as a test sample. After the apoptotic cells are stained, it was calculated the median effective 
concentration of reference material and sample based on their fluorescence and then the cell apoptosis activity 
of HLX02 by comparing the median effective concentration of reference material and sample. Relative apoptosis 
activities were calculated based on the ratio of EC50 values.

Additional analyses 
Herceptin batches with expiry dates between August 2018 and December 2019 were reported with a marked 
downward shift in %Afucose, FcγRⅢa binding affinity and ADCC activity (Kim 2017). To investigate whether 
such findings were present in the products tested in HLX02 biosimilarity assessment, the FcγRⅢa binding and 
ADCC activity were summarized and compared among 39 Herceptin batches with different expiry dates.  
Results are presented below. Consistent with the Samsung Bioepis’s report (Kim 2017), among the 39 Herceptin 
batches,  all  the  5  batches  with  expiry  dates  before February  2018  showed normal  levels  for  the %Afucose, 
%Galactose and FcγRIIIa affinity, all the 23 Herceptin batches with expiry dates between February 2018 and 
May 2020 had the %Afucose, %Galactose and FcγRIIIa affinity down drifted, and all the 11 Herceptin batches 
with expiry dates after May 2020 returned to the original levels (Figure 10). 
As a result, Herceptin batches analysed in the study were divided into two groups: low FcγRIIIa binding affinity 
with expiry dates between February 2018 and May 2020; and high FcγRIIIa binding affinity with expiry dates 
before February 2018 or after May 2020. In addition, the binding affinity to other FcγRs, FcRn and C1q, as well 
as proliferation inhibition activity, CDC and apoptosis, were similar among the Herceptin batches investigated in 
the study. Comparison of FcγRIIIa binding and ADCC (reporter gene) activities for HLX02 and the Herceptin with 
low affinity and with high affinity, respectively is shown in Figure 11. 
For the additional data of ADCC assays using NK cells, the relevance between ADCC activity (NK cell based) and 
the expiry dates of Herceptin were also analysed (Figure 12). The results showed that, similar to the observation 
from  the  data  of  ADCC  reporter  assay,  the  ADCC  activity  in  Herceptin-EU  batches  expiring  after  May  2020 
returned to a relatively high levels when compared with Herceptin-EU batches expiring between February 2018 
and May 2020.

In vivo studies 
Animal studies were undertaken to compare the pharmacodynamic characteristics of HLX02 versus 
China-sourced Herceptin in various cancer types (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). The applicant also 
performed cynomolgus monkey and human tissue cross-reactivity studies as well as an in vivo CNS safety 
pharmacology in mice. ECGs have been included in the 13-week repeat dose toxicity study performed in 
monkeys (see discussion safety pharmacology).  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In vivo behavioural test of ICR mice intravenously injected with HLX02 
Fifty ICR mice assigned into 5 groups containing 5 female and 5 male mice were administered a single 
intravenous injection of HLX02 (process 1.0 batch H20120101) at doses of 8, 16 and 32 mg/kg. Diazepam (2.5 
mg/kg) was used as the positive control. Pole climbing and air righting reflex were observed before 
administration and at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after administration. 
There were no effects on mouse behaviour and coordinated movement. 
In vivo GLP safety pharmacology study on the effect of intravenous injection of HLX02 in cynomolgus monkeys 
on cardiovascular system and respiratory rate 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) indicators were evaluated as part of the repeat dose toxicity study performed in 
monkeys at baseline, 2 h and 24 h after the first administration, on Day 29 (2 h after the 5th administration), on 
Day 42, on Day 57 (2 h after the 9th administration), and on Day 91 and at the end of convalescence period. 
Blood pressure and respiratory rate were measured before the administration (baseline), 2 h and 24 h after the 
first administration, on Day 42, on Day 91 and at the end of convalescence period.

Compared with the placebo group, QTcf was significantly shortened in HLX02 groups at 24 and 48 mg/kg as well 
as 24 mg/kg Herceptin group on Day 29, but compared to the testing results of ECG before administration 
(baseline), the degree of QTcf change in 24 and 48 mg/kg HLX02 as well as 24 mg/kg Herceptin groups was 
relatively small, and no significant abnormalities were observed at other testing time points. Intravenous 
injection of HLX02 with the dosages of 8, 24, 48 mg/kg and Herceptin at 24 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys 
showed no effects on ECG, blood pressure and respiratory rate. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant provided the results from two studies comparing the exposures of HLX02 and Herceptin sourced 
from China (see discussion on non-clinical aspects): one study using single IV doses (in comparison with 
Herceptin) and repeat IV doses of the test product and another study using single IV doses of HLX02 
manufactured with different processes. 
Table 14: Tabulated overview of HLX02 pharmacokinetic studies 
Absorption 
The first study included 3 single i.v. HLX02 groups at doses of 1 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg, one single i.v. 
Herceptin group (4 mg/kg, batch B3458) and one repeated i.v. HLX02 group at 4 mg/kg. Four (4) cynomolgus 
monkeys were used in each dose group. HLX02 batch H20120101 was used in this study. From each animal 
receiving single administration, 1 mL of blood was collected before  administration as well as 5 minutes (min), 
15 min, 30 min (test drug needle withdrawal point), 35 min, 45 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 5 h, 7 h, 9 h, 13 h, 24 h, 48 
h, 72 h, 96 h, 120 h, 168 h, 216 h, 264 h, 312 h and 480 h after i.v. infusion (the start of administration was set 
as point 0). In the repeat dose administration group, the repeat administration was applied at 168 h after the 
previous administration, and 1 mL of blood was collected before administration and at needle withdrawal point 
(30 minutes after the start of the infusion) for the second and third administration; the time points for blood 
collection after the last dose administration were the same as that in single dose administration group.

A dose proportional increase was observed for HLX02 and the reference product. The study also showed some 
accumulation of the compound following four weekly administrations. 
The second study aimed at comparing the pharmacokinetic profiles of HLX02 produced by 2 different 
manufacturing processes, namely P2.0 and P4.0. All animals were treated with HLX02 at 4 mg/kg by single 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Blood samples were collected from each animal at pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 
2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 168, 240, 336, 504, and 672 hours post-dose. The results showed no difference in 
pharmacokinetic parameters.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The program contained one single dose assay, one repeat dose (13 weeks treatment with 8 weeks recovery) 
assay and one in vitro haemolysis assay in New Zealand White rabbit erythrocytes. Studies have been conducted 
with HLX02 DP manufactured with DS P1.0 versus China-sourced Herceptin (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects). 
Single dose toxicity 
In vivo toxicity study of single intravenous injection of HLX02 in cynomolgus monkeys (study 
1125AD1) 
Table 16: Single-dose toxicity (study 1125AD1) 
Cynomolgus monkeys about 3-4 years old (n=6 in total; 2 animals/group (1 male and 1 female)) were 
administered with HLX02 (DS P1.0, batch H20120101) at a single IV dose of 210 mg/kg of body weight. Two 
control groups were established: solvent group (0 mg/kg, NaCl injection) and vehicle group (0 mg/kg HLX02 
placebo solution), mixed with 0.3 ml of NaCl to adjust the osmotic pressure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 37/153 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The results showed that no animal died during the study. Compared to solvent group, no significant abnormal 
changes in clinical symptoms, body weight, food intake, body temperature, ECG examination, haematology and 
blood coagulation indexes, serum biochemical indexes and indexes of immune functions were found in either 
vehicle group or HLX02 group. At the end of the observation period, no obvious abnormalities were detected in 
gross necropsy of all test animals, and no evident pathological changes related to toxicity of HLX02 were 
detected. 
According to the results, the NOAEL for single IV administration of HLX02 (Process 1.0) in cynomolgus monkeys 
was set up at 210 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
A thirteen-week repeated intravenous injection of HLX02 followed by an eight-week recovery period was also 
performed in the cynomolgus monkey. The same batch as above was used. The animals were allocated in 5 
groups of 6 animals each (3M/3F) and received 0 mg/kg (vehicle control group), 8 mg/kg HLX02 (low-dose 
group), 24 mg/kg HLX02 (middle-dose group), 48 mg/kg HLX02 (high-dose group) and 24 mg/kg 
China-sourced Herceptin (referred to as “reference control”) once a week. 
Table 17: Repeat dose toxicity (study 1125RD1) 
Histopathological changes that were considered to be test article were noted in thyroid and spleen. At the end of 
both dosing period and recovery, thyroid of animals from low-, middle-, high-dose groups and comparator group 
all showed slight to mild colloid goiter. Spleen of animals from low-, middle-, high-dose groups at the end of 
dosing period and from low- and middle-dose groups and comparator group all showed slight to mild hyperplasia 
of white pulp in spleen. This was consistent with the enlarged volume of animal thyroid and spleen seen at gross 
anatomy.  
In addition, at the end of administration period and recovery, animals from each group showed slightly mild 
vacuolar degeneration in myocardial cells.  
The toxicokinetic parameters of HLX02 and comparator are presented in Table 18. 
No specific antibody against recombinant anti-HER2 antibody was detected in any of the groups. 
HLX02 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys following once weekly dosing for 13 weeks at doses up to 48 
mg/kg, and the toxicity and TK profile of HLX02 was similar to that of the reference medicinal product 
China-sourced Herceptin.

Genotoxicity 
The applicant did not submit genotoxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Carcinogenicity 
The applicant did not submit carcinogenicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The applicant did not submit reproduction toxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Toxicokinetic data 
As part of the repeat dose toxicity study performed in monkeys, serum samples were drawn as follows: Vehicle 
control group: 2 hours before and after administration; low-, middle- and high-dose group and control group: 
First and last administration: 2, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168 hours before and after administration respectively (±2 
min for the time point ≤1h, and ±15 min for the rest of time points). 
The results are provided in the table below.  
Table 18: Toxicokinetic results from repeat dose toxicity study 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed as part of the 13-week repeat dose toxicity study performed in monkeys and 
summarised above. No significant dosing site irritation was observed for any animals during the in-life 
observation and necropsy examination. Microscopic examination revealed perivascular bleeding (haemorrhage) 
and vascular wall-thickening, mild proliferation of perivascular fibrous tissue at the injection site in animals of 
vehicle control group, low-dose group and high-dose group. It was considered that the injection lesions were 
caused by the mechanical irritation of administration and were not test article related. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted a justification for not providing an environmental risk assessment. According to the 
“Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use" 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2*) certain types of products such as proteins are exempted from providing 
ERA studies because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment due to their nature. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 39/153 
 
  
  
 
 
absence of a formal environmental risk assessment studies is considered justified and HLX02 is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment due to its nature. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
This application is based on the comparison of HLX02 (Zercepac) and the reference product Herceptin. Zercepac 
is formulated with the same excipients as the reference product.  
Successive versions of the HLX02 DS manufacturing process (MP) have been developed and batches from 
several MPs have been used in studies throughout the development program. HLX02 material from the different 
manufacturing process are considered analytically comparable (see quality aspects). 
The pharmacology program focused on primary pharmacodynamics. The in vitro studies were conducted with 
HLX02 from two different manufacturing processes and comparisons were performed with EU Herceptin 
batches. The following studies were conducted by the Applicant with the purpose of the assessment of in vitro 
biosimilarity: 1) HER2 binding by ELISA, 2) Binding kinetics to Soluble HER2 by SPR 3) Inhibition of proliferation 
assay, 4) Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity employing NK92-CD16 effector cells and the reporter 
cell line NFAT_CD16a_Jurkat, 5) Apoptosis assay, 6) Complement-dependent cytotoxicity, 7) FcγR 
Receptor-affinity Assay, 8) FcRn Receptor-affinity Assay, 9) C1q binding by ELISA, 10) Antibody-dependent 
Cellular Phagocytosis.  
One of the ADCC assays provided by the Applicant (BAD-TP-051) was conducted using engineered reporter cells, 
more precisely the reporter cell line NFAT_CD16a_Jurkat with FcγRIIIa 158V genotype. Although in some 
instances these reporters might be considered more reproducible than the classic assays, current consensus 
indicates that classic assays are more reliable when a determination on the similarity should be made. For that 
reason, results from an ADCC assay with NK92-CD16 effector cells, expressing FcγRIIIa V/F (BAD-TP-286) were 
also provided. Similarity between HLX02 and the reference product Herceptin was concluded in both assays.  
ADCP has also been investigated (BAD-TP-252). NFAT_FcγRIIa-H_Jurkat cells were used in the study. For this 
secondary mechanism of action, similarity between HLX02 and the reference product Herceptin was concluded. 
Regarding CDC, HLX02-induced CDC was not observed, similarly to Herceptin, likely due to the presence of 
membrane-associated complement regulatory proteins such as CD35 (complement receptor 1, CR1), CD55 
(decay accelerating factor, DAF), or CD46 (membrane cofactor protein, MCP).  
Some differences relative to afucosylation, FCγRIIIa binding and ADCC activity were described in several 
batches of EU Herceptin that have been employed for the in vitro determinations. A total of 39 Herceptin batches 
were used in the studies, 23 of them (15 EU and 8 CN batches with expiration dates between February 2018 and 
May 2020) presenting with an atypical profile involving lower percentages of afucosylation and galactosylation, 
lower FcγRIII binding activity and decreased relative potency of ADCC. The Applicant has compared HLX02 with 
all those 39 batches, providing a separate analysis of each study for the atypical ones. It was concluded in all the 
comparisons that HLX02 could be considered similar to Herceptin, but with a profile closer to those batches with 
high FcγRIIIa-158V affinity.   
Overall, the results of the in vitro primary pharmacodynamics studies allow concluding on the similarity between 
Herceptin and HLX02 (Zercepac) from a non-clinical perspective.  
In vivo studies investigating primary pharmacodynamics in various mouse models of several cancer types (even 
those not included in the claimed indications) were provided with a lot of product prepared with an earlier 
manufacturing process. Comparisons were conducted with China-sourced Herceptin and the relevance of 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 40/153 
 
  
  
 
comparability studies with non-EEA authorised products is limited. Furthermore, in biosimilar applications, in 
vitro pharmacology comparability is considered the paramount of comparability assessment as in vivo models 
are not considered sensitive enough to detect differences and are mostly regarded as supportive. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies were not provided but are not considered necessary for the evaluation of 
biosimilar medicinal product. Due to the nature of the product and the type of application, pharmacodynamic 
drug interactions are also not considered necessary for the evaluation (Guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues, 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). 
Results from two safety pharmacology studies with HLX02 were provided. Not only those studies are unneeded 
since the safety of the compound has been characterised following the long-term use in humans but also it is not 
clarified if the mice and NHP expressed the desired epitope. In addition, the in vivo behavioural study in mice did 
not provide data with the reference product Herceptin, and therefore is not considered relevant for the 
comparability exercise.  
The second study was carried out in monkeys for the assessment of CVS and respiratory effects. It should be 
noted that stand alone safety pharmacology studies are not required for the evaluation of biotechnology 
medicinal products as indicated in the ICH guideline S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of 
Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals and dosing non-human primates for the toxicological assessment of a 
biosimilar product is not recommended unless justified. The in vivo study in monkeys has revealed non relevant 
effects on the QTcf prolonged QT intervals and increased QTd (QT dispersion). Although long term studies with 
trastuzumab in breast cancer patients have reported prolonged QT intervals and increased QTd (QT dispersion), 
the findings seen in cynomolgus monkeys seem unrelated to the clinical findings described in the literature. 
Results from two pharmacokinetic studies with the product HLX02 manufactured with DS P1.0 were also 
provided. In the first study (1125rd1-pk) the test substance (HLX02) was compared with China-sourced 
Herceptin. As mentioned above, the relevance of comparability studies with non-EEA authorised products is 
limited, unless a thorough justification and a bridging exercise to the currently EEA authorised reference 
medicinal product is provided. From the information submitted it is understood that the applicant addressed the 
pharmacokinetics of HLX02 to fulfil regulatory requirement of other regions. The limited number of animals 
studied per group does not allow performing statistical analysis on the obtained results and no justification for 
the selection of cynomolgus monkeys as the selected species was provided by the Applicant. Furthermore, in the 
context of biosimilarity assessment, animal pharmacokinetic studies are not considered sensitive enough to 
highlight differences between the biosimilar and the reference product due to a high variability.  
In another PK study, HLX02 products manufactured with DS P2.0 and DS P4.0 were compared, as both were 
used in the Phase 1 and 3 clinical studies. In this case Herceptin was not included in the aforementioned assay, 
therefore the relevance of the data produced for the determination of biosimilarity is limited. 
Considering the type of product, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug interaction 
studies are not deemed necessary. 
Furthermore, toxicity studies are in principle not needed for biosimilarity assessment. The safety profile is 
already known from the reference product and there is a large clinical experience which is considered as more 
relevant for safety information. Studies performed in animals are not considered sensitive enough to allow 
detection of any subtle pharmacological or toxicological differences between the biosimilar candidate product 
and the reference product. However, it is understood that the applicant evaluated the toxicity of HLX02 in order 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 41/153 
 
  
  
 
to comply with regulatory requirements of other regions. The provided studies were performed with a batch of 
the biosimilar from an earlier manufacturing process which was compared to China-sourced Herceptin. 
The purpose of the single dose toxicity study was to assess the toxicity of HLX02 upon a single administration at 
a dose of 210 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys. The limited number of animals critically limits the conclusions that 
can be extrapolated from this assay (2 animals per group). In any case, the study showed no significant toxicity 
in the animals after 14 days. Since no animals were exposed to Herceptin (the reference medicinal product) the 
data submitted is not considered relevant for the comparability assessment.  
The Applicant also provided results from a repeat dose toxicity study using different dosing levels for the test 
product HLX02. Only the data obtained upon treatment of the animals at 24 mg/kg, either with HLX02 or 
Herceptin, may be considered supportive for the assessment of biosimilarity. Additional comparative doses 
would have been desirable should the Applicant aims were to produce relevant safety comparability data 
between HLX02 and Herceptin. It should be noted that according to the Guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing monoclonal antibodies, non-clinical and clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) 
the conduct of toxicological studies in non-human primates is usually not recommended. Furthermore, the 
scarce number of animals in the study does not allow to draw conclusions.  
The toxicokinetics determination was not GLP compliant. As in the repeat dose toxicity study, only the 
comparative data obtained with HLX02 and Herceptin at a dose of 24 mg/kg (middle dose group versus control 
group) would be considered for the assessment of biosimilarity. Remarkable differences were evident for the 
determination of Tmax while the other determinations (AUC and Cmax) were similar between HLX02 and 
Herceptin. It is noted that the study is not considered powered enough to conduct a formal 
toxicokinetic-biosimilarity assessment, as only 6 animals were included in each group.   
Considering the type of product and the type of MAA, the lack of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive 
and developmental studies is considered adequate (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues, 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1).  Although the same principle is applied for local tolerance studies, 
observations were conducted as part of the repeat dose toxicity study and did not suggest relevant local 
tolerance issues. 
No ADAs were detected in the repeat dose toxicity study. In any case, the predictive value of the non-clinical 
data is limited and relevant antigenicity data is obtained in the clinical trials (see section on clinical aspects). 
Due to the type of Application and according to the ICH guideline S6 (R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of 
Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998), routine immunotoxicity testing for 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals is not recommended. Due to the nature of the product no dependence, 
metabolites and impurities studies are required. 
Overall, the provided animal studies are only considered supportive information. In the context of biosimilarity 
assessment, these studies are not considered necessary if comparability is demonstrated in in vitro assays 
which is the case for HLX02. However, it is acknowledged that, in this case, such studies were conducted for 
regulatory compliance in other regions.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The assessment of the non-clinical data indicated similar activity between HLX02 and the reference product 
Herceptin.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
A routine GCP inspection of trial HLX02-BC01 was performed at two investigator sites (one in the Philippines and 
one in China) and a CRO in China.  
Although there were deficiencies and departures from GCP observed, the trial in general has been conducted 
according to the ethical principles for clinical trials in humans and the data collected at the investigational sites 
inspected are considered of acceptable quality and the sites as overall GCP compliant. 
In addition, GCP inspections were performed by the US FDA at 1 investigator site in China and the 3 investigator 
sites in the Ukraine.

The clinical comparability exercise was performed in a stepwise procedure that begin with a primary 
pharmacokinetic (PK) comparative study (HLX02-HV01) followed by a comparative clinical efficacy trial versus 
the chosen reference medicinal product (HLX02-BC01).  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The HLX02 PK programme included a Phase 1 comparative single-dose study conducted in healthy volunteers 
(HLX02-HV01), and a supportive Phase 3 clinical comparability study in patients with HER2-positive metastatic 
breast cancer in combination with docetaxel (HLX02-BC01).  
Both the EU-Herceptin and the product sourced in China (CN) were used in the PK similarity study (HLX02-HV01) 
whereas Herceptin used in the clinical comparability Phase 3 Study (HLX02-BC01) was the product sourced in 
the EU. The EU-Herceptin products were manufactured in Germany while the CN-Herceptin products were 
manufactured in the United States (US).  
Bioanalytical methods 
Pre-study validation 
In both clinical studies [HLX02-HV01, HLX02-BC01], the bioanalytical method used for measuring serum drug 
concentrations of HLX02 and Herceptin was a validated ELISA method.  
In addition, in clinical study HLX02-BC01, the concentrations of HER2 in human serum were measured by 
utilising a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay with validated bioanalytical method.  
An ELISA analytical method to quantify the concentration of trastuzumab in human plasma and in patients with 
Her2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer as well as their respective amendments were submitted. The validation of the 
method included assessment of precision and accuracy of the standard curve, the assay range (defined by the 
LLOQ and ULOQ), intra-assay and inter-assay accuracy and precision assessment (HLX02 and Herceptin), 
robustness, selectivity (HLX02), minimum required dilution, dilution linearity and hook effect (HLX02 and 
Herceptin), Herceptin comparison, short-term stability, freeze-thaw stability and long term stability (HLX02 and 
Herceptin), target interference and hemolysis and lipemic.

A second ELISA analytical method to quantify the concentration of HER-2 in human serum was also submitted. 
The validation of the method included assessment of precision and accuracy of the standard curve, the assay 
range (defined by the LLOQ and ULOQ), intra-assay and inter-assay accuracy and precision assessment, 
robustness, selectivity, minimum required dilution, dilution linearity and hook effect, target interference, 
parallelism and the specificity of the method.

Study HLX02-HV01 
There were 2 parts in this study (see the figures below). Part 1 was an open-label study to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability and assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of different dosages of HLX02 in healthy Chinese 
male subjects. Part 2 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the PK profiles, safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity between HLX02 and US-sourced Herceptin (currently available in the Chinese 
market), HLX02 and the Germany-sourced Herceptin, and US-sourced and Germany-sourced Herceptin.

Figure 14: Study design of safety evaluation of HLX02 (Study HLX02-HV01, part 2) 
HLX02 and Herceptin were reconstituted with sterile water for injection dependent on the vial size, as follows: 
−  HLX02: trastuzumab 150 mg vial was reconstituted with 7.2 mL of sterile water for injection without 
preservative. 
−  US-sourced Herceptin: trastuzumab 440 mg vial was reconstituted with 20 mL diluent (20 mL sterile 
water for injection containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol). 
−  Germany-sourced Herceptin: trastuzumab 150 mg vial was reconstituted with 7.2 mL of sterile water for 
injection without preservative. 
The subjects received a single dose 90-minute IV infusion of HLX02, US-sourced Herceptin, or Germany-sourced 
Herceptin. The subjects were to be in a supine or semi-recumbent position from the start of the infusion until 2 
hours after the completion of infusion. 
In Part I of the study, a total of 18 subjects were screened and 12 subjects were assigned in one of the 4 
treatment groups (2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg groups), according to the study plan; 6 subjects were screening failures 
due to not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. All of the 12 subjects completed Part 1 as planned. No 
subjects withdrew or were withdrawn from the study. 
The enrolled study population consisted of 12 Chinese males, ranging in age from 19 to 35 years, ranging in 
weight from 58.0 to 73.5 kg, and ranging in height from 166.0 to 175.0 cm. 
In Part 2, a total of 111 subjects were eligible and randomized in one of the 3 treatment groups (HLX02, 
US-Sourced Herceptin, and Germany-sourced Herceptin groups), according to the study plan. A total 109 
subjects completed the study. Two subjects were withdrawn from Part 2 because they were lost to follow-up;

both were from the US-Sourced Herceptin group. These subjects were excluded from the PK-PPS2 because their 
AUClast could not be reliably calculated.  
The enrolled study population consisted of 111 healthy Chinese male subjects, ranging in age from 18 to 45 
years, ranging in weight from 51.0 to 80.0 kg, ranging in height from 159.5 to 185.0 cm and ranging in BMI from 
19.0 to 27.5 kg/m2. 
Pharmacokinetics Results 
Part 1 
The individual serum concentrations of HLX02 versus time curves were provided by treatment group in linear 
scale and in semi-logarithmic scale. Mean serum concentrations on a linear scale (left panel) and 
semi-logarithmic scale (right panel) over nominal time by treatment group are presented in the Figures below. 
Figure 15: Mean Serum Concentrations on Linear Scale (Left) and Semi-Logarithmic Scale (Right) 
(PK-PPS 1) 
Following single dose IV infusion, HLX02 cleared slowly from serum. At 2 mg/kg, the elimination of HLX02 
exhibited single exponential profiles; no serumHLX02 concentrations were detected in all three subjects after 29 
days post-dose.  
Different PK profiles were observed at doses ≥4 mg/kg, with an initial rapid decline similar to the elimination 
phase observed at the 2 mg/kg dose followed by a slower decline at higher serum HLX02 concentrations and a 
gradual increase in elimination rate at lower serum HLX02 concentrations. At doses ≥6 mg/kg, concentrations 
were still detectible in all subjects after 57 days post-dose.

Increases in AUC0-inf appeared to be greater than dose proportional. Mean values for the secondary endpoints of 
AUC0-t, AUCall, Cmax, and t½ all increased with dose, while tmax and Vz were similar across the 4 treatment groups. 
Additionally, the clearance decreased with dose.

Summary statistics of PK parameters based on corrected serum concentration data by treatment group in 
PK-PPS2 population were also submitted. The mean AUCinf values in HLX02, US-sourced Herceptin and 
Germany-sourced Herceptin were 20115, 21103 and 21919 μg·h/mL, respectively. The mean AUClast values in 
HLX02, US-sourced Herceptin and Germany-sourced Herceptin were 19965.20943 and 21748 μg h/mL, 
respectively. AUClast and AUCall values were the same. The mean Cmax values were also comparable (127.890, 
128.920 and 122.851 μg/mL inHLX02, US-sourced Herceptin and Germany-sourced Herceptin, respectively). 
The median tmax values of HLX02, US-sourced Herceptin and Germany-sourced Herceptin were 3.000, 2.000 and

2.000 hours, respectively. The mean t1/2 of HLX02 was comparable to that of US-sourced Herceptin and 
Germany-sourced Herceptin (139.8, 147.5 and 148.3 hours, respectively). 
Statistical comparison of PK parameters (based on uncorrected and corrected serum concentration data)

The 90% CIs for test-to-reference ratios of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ were contained within the pre-specified 
acceptance boundaries of 80% to 125% for all of the pair-wise comparisons among the 3 study drugs, 
demonstrating pharmacokinetic similarity among HLX02, trastuzumab-EU, and trastuzumab-US.  
The median tmax for HLX02, EU-sourced Herceptin, CN-sourced Herceptin was 3.000, 2.000 hours and 2.000 
hours, respectively, and are not statistically different. These results were obtained in both uncorrected and 
corrected serum concentrations.  
Secondary PK parameters (Cmax and AUC0-t) support biosimilarity in terms of pharmacokinetics between HLX02, 
EU-sourced Herceptin and CN-sourced Herceptin.  
An additional statistical analysis was requested related to the secondary PK parameters (Vz, CL, and t1/2). 
These PK parameters were compared between Zercepac and EU Herceptin, presenting the ratios of the 
geometric means with the 90% confidence. Based on the statistical analysis provided, all the secondary PK 
parameters (Vz, CL, and t1/2) fell within the predefined bioequivalence margin of 0.8 to 1.25.  
No subject did test as ADA positive at any time point, neither in Part 1 nor Part 2.  
The use of immunogenicity assays, especially neutralising assay, was based on risk assessment. No neutralising 
antibody assay for phase 1 study was developed, because there were no positive ADA samples (see also Safety 
section). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study HLX02-BC01 (EUDRACT Number(s): 2016-000206-10) 
This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, multicentre, international study to compare the efficacy and to 
evaluate the safety and immunogenicity similarity of HLX02 and EU-sourced Herceptin in patients with 
HER2-positive, recurrent or previously untreated metastatic breast cancer (see Figure 28). 
HLX02 or EU-sourced Herceptin was administered intravenously, initially at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 
minutes on Day 1, Cycle 1 followed by a dose of 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks in 3-weekly cycles over 30-90 
minutes (ie, any duration between 30 and 90 minutes from Cycle 2onwards)for up to a maximum of 12 months. 
Docetaxel of 75 mg/m2 was co-administered intravenously (after HLX02 or EU-sourced Herceptin) once every 3 
weeks for at least 8 cycles and thereafter at the Investigator’s discretion for up to a maximum of 12 months. 
On Day 1 of every treatment cycle, body weight was used to calculate the required dose ofHLX02 or Herceptin 
and docetaxel (study drug). All patients were given prophylactic dexamethasone. The Principal Investigator 
ensured that any weight change was not due to fluid retention. If it was due to fluid retention, the patient was 
given oral furosemide (or an equivalent diuretic). The dose was adjusted only if the patient’s weight changed by 
more than±10% from baseline. 
PK blood samples were collected from all patients at Cycle 1 within 7 days prior to infusion at the time of blood 
sampling for assessment of haematology, baseline level of shed antigen, and the test for antibodies against 
trastuzumab (ADA/NAb). Then, starting at Cycle 3, within 3 days prior to infusion every 3 cycles (approximately 
every 9 weeks; Cycles 6, 9, 12, and 15), PK samples were collected at the same time as sample collections to 
assess for the presence of ADA/NAb while on treatment with HLX02 or Herceptin. Extended PK collections were 
collected from all patients in Cycle 1 on Day 1 at the end of infusion, then at Cycles 4 and 8 prior to infusion (at 
the same time as blood sampling for assessment of haematology) and Cycle 8 Day 1 at the end of infusion.

Trastuzumab serum concentrations by scheduled collections for each treatment are summarized in the following 
table. 
Table 25: Summary Statistics of Trastuzumab Serum Concentrations (ng/mL) by Scheduled Collection for Each 
Treatment – Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set 
Tens subjects were found to have quantifiable concentrations of trastuzumab at pre-dose of Cycle 1 for Zercepac 
(n>=LLOQ: 27) and Herceptin (n>=LLOQ: 22). The majority of these subjects had significant levels of 
trastuzumab detected in the serum, including one patient with levels over 148 µg/mL.  
To investigate the impact of subjects with quantifiable baseline trastuzumab, results from a sensitivity analysis 
were provided. Of the original pharmacokinetic analysis set, subjects with trastuzumab concentration above 
LLOQ before first dose were excluded (reduced from 319 to 291 and 322 to 300 subjects in HLX02 and Herceptin 
group, respectively), and PK comparative analysis was performed in the new PK set.

The trastuzumab serum concentrations of the patients in both the HLX02 and Herceptin groups reached the peak 
values at the EOI of Cycle 1, of which the mean concentrations (± SD) were 178926.141 ± 253784.2849 ng/mL 
and 177853.188 ± 56666.2342 ng/mL, respectively. At the EOI of HLX02 or Herceptin at Cycle 8, the 
concentrations also reached the highest values of the current cycle with the mean concentrations (± SD) were 
123713.349 ± 47589.8211 ng/mL and 136344.52 ± 41036.6192 ng/mL, respectively, which were a little lower 
than those values obtained at the EOI of Cycle 1. 
Before infusion at Cycle 3, the mean concentrations (± SD) for HLX02 and Herceptin treatment groups were 
12978.930 ± 8150.6892 ng/mL and 15915.533 ± 8445.8965 ng/mL, respectively. For both treatment groups, 
the mean trough concentrations obtained at the subsequent cycles increased slightly as time went by.

Population PK analysis 
Per request, a population PK analysis combining data from Study HLX02-BC01 and HLX02-HV01 was provided to 
identify factors that have impact on HLX02 and EU-sourced Herceptin PK profiles, and to compare PK profiles 
under different circumstances. 
The popPK (population PK) analysis was based on the HLX02-HV01 and HLX02-BC01 studies, containing 754 
subjects with 5,882 samples. Suitable covariates of popPK model were selected based on statistical evaluation, 
clinical judgment, mechanistic plausibility and prior knowledge. The following covariates were tested: age, body 
weight,  race  (Asian  vs  Non-Asian),  baseline  albumin,  baseline  alanine  aminotransferase,  baseline  aspartate 
aminotransferase,  baseline  bilirubin,  baseline  creatinine  clearance,  formulation  (EU-sourced  herceptin  vs. 
US-sourced  herceptin),  health  status  (healthy  volunteer  vs.  MBC  patients)  and  shed  antigen.  The  identified 
parameter-covariates  relationships  were  incorporated,  generating  a  final  popPK  model  of  two-compartment 
with first order elimination from the central compartment and redistribution into the peripheral compartments.

HLX02 and Herceptin 
Impact of Formulation on HLX02 and Herceptin Steady-State Exposure 
There was no significant difference in steady state exposures between EU-source Herceptin and US-sourced 
Herceptin. The AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss of HLX02 were 13.0%, 10.2%, and 23.1%, respectively, lower than 
that of EU-sourced Herceptin. Similarly, the AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss of HLX02 were 12.2%, 10.9%, and 
19.7%, respectively, lower than that of US-sourced Herceptin. 
Impact of HER-2 Shed Antigen on HLX02 and Herceptin Steady-State Exposure 
Subjects with higher shed antigen demonstrated lower AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss in both HLX02 (13.4% for 
AUCss, 4.54% for Cmax,ss, and 33.1% for Cmin,ss) and Herceptin (7.55% for AUCss, 2.12% for Cmax,ss, and 
18.3% for Cmin,ss). The shed antigen difference in exposures between HLX02 and Herceptin was less than 15% 
(7.55~13.4% for AUCss, 2.12~4.54% for Cmax,ss, and 18.3~33.1% for Cmin,ss). 
Impact of Body Weight on HLX02 and Herceptin Steady-State Exposure 
Body weight was tested as a significant covariate in the population PK analysis. To assess the impact of weight, 
the final population PK model predicted steady-state exposures were compared in body weight stratified by 
median. Subjects with higher body weight demonstrated higher AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss values. The HLX02 
exposures (AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss) observed in subjects in the equal and below median of body weight 
were 15.8%, 13.9%, and 15.5% higher, respectively than that in subjects in the body weight above median. The 
Herceptin exposures (AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss) observed in subjects in the equal and below median of 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 67/153 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
body weight were 16.7%, 14.4%, and 17.0% lower, respectively than that in subjects in the body weight above 
median. 
Impact of ADA on HLX02 and Herceptin Steady-State Exposure 
The HLX02 exposures in ADA negative subjects were higher than that in ADA positive subjects (73.4%, 9.92%, 
and 419% for AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss, respectively), as well as the Herceptin exposures in ADA negative 
subjects were higher than that in ADA positive subjects (6.95%, 0.988%, and 18.5% for AUCss, Cmax,ss and 
Cmin,ss, respectively). This was partially attributed to the higher Shed in ADA positive group (121.2 vs 11.67 
ng/mL for HLX02, 249.9 vs 10.18 ng/mL for Herceptin). It is noted that the numbers of ADA -positive patients 
was low (less than 1% ADA positive patients). 
Impact of NAb on HLX02 and Herceptin Steady-State Exposure 
The HLX02 exposures in NAb negative subjects were higher than that in NAb positive subjects (73.4%, 9.92%, 
and 419% for AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss, respectively), as well as the Herceptin exposures in NAb negative 
subjects were higher than that in NAb positive subjects (6.95%, 0.988%, and 18.5% for AUCss, Cmax,ss and 
Cmin,ss, respectively). This was partially attributed to the higher Shed in NAb positive group (121.2 vs 11.67 
ng/mL for HLX02, 249.9 vs 10.18ng/mL for Herceptin). It is noted that the numbers of NAb-positive patients 
was low (less than 1% NAb positive patients). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
See discussion on clinical pharmacology.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The HLX02 clinical development plan consisted of two clinical studies, including a clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) 
similarity study (HLX02-HV01), and a Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety comparability study (HLX02-BC01). PK 
data were provided from the PK study in healthy volunteers and from PK sampling in all patients enrolled in the 
comparative efficacy and safety study. A pivotal PK study in patients was not conducted. The PK profile of HLX02 
and of Herceptin was determined through a Population PK analysis. 
In general, the development program to demonstrate the similarity between HLX02 and Herceptin-EU with 
respect to the pharmacokinetic (PK) is considered adequate and was generally performed according to the 
guidance on biosimilars and the recommendations given in the Scientific Advice procedures. The design and the 
proposed endpoints of the PK study are deemed sufficient and sensitive to fulfil the trastuzumab PK similarity 
requirement for the proposed trastuzumab formulation intended for intravenous administration only.  
The applicant did not claim subcutaneous use. As only PK data on IV administration were submitted under this 
application, only the IV route of administration can be authorised under this MA procedure (see SmPC section 
4.2.). 
The test and reference products and the mode of administration are considered suitable for a bioequivalence 
study. However, as outlined in the guideline for biosimilars (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012) it is strongly 
recommended to generate the required quality, safety and efficacy data for the demonstration of biosimilarity 
against the reference medicinal product using product manufactured with the commercial manufacturing 
process and therefore representing the quality profile of the batches to be commercialised. This 
recommendation has not been followed during the development of HLX02; the material used in the 
bioequivalence study in healthy Chinese volunteers was produced using a prior manufacturing process. To 
Assessment report

address this issue, a comprehensive analytical comparability study according to ICH Q5E guideline was 
subsequently performed to compare the different DS manufacturing process. Overall, HLX02 material from the 
different manufacturing process are considered analytically comparable. Accordingly, non-clinical material and 
batches used in the clinical trials are considered comparable to and thus representative for the PV and 
commercial batches (see also quality and non-clinical aspects). 
The comparability between US licensed Herceptin formulations were used as supportive data. 
Two ELISA analytical methods to quantify the concentration of trastuzumab in human plasma and to quantify 
the concentration of HER-2 in human serum were submitted. Based on the evaluated parameters, both ELISA 
methods are considered suitable for the quantification the concentration of trastuzumab and the quantification 
of HER-2 in human plasma.  
With regards to the method to quantify the concentration of HER-2 in human serum, additional stability tests are 
being carrying out and the applicant is recommended to submit this report.  
A safety evaluation with the escalation of four doses of HLX02 (2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg) was performed in Part 1 of 
study HLX02-HV01 as HLX02 was to be administered to humans for the first time in China. As the four doses 
represent the current clinical dose range for the reference drug Herceptin, the safety evaluation provides human 
safety data for HLX02. 
The proposed study design of study HLX02-HV01 Part 2 (parallel design instead of a cross-over design) is 
acceptable due to the long half-life of monoclonal antibodies in general (approx. 22 days for trastuzumab) and 
is in line with the requirements as outlined in the Guideline on the clinical investigation of the pharmacokinetics 
of therapeutic proteins (CHMP/EWP/89249/2004). 
According to the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1, for drugs 
with non-linear pharmacokinetics, the bioequivalence study should in general be conducted at the highest 
strength, i.e. 8 mg/kg for Herceptin. However, the proposed dose of 6 mg/kg is considered adequate based on 
the posology of the reference product. This is also in line with the Scientific Advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/476339/2016) in which it was considered that a lower dose could also have been appropriate 
to establish biosimilarity with less risk for toxicity. 
According to the above Scientific Advice, the proposed 57 days of blood sampling may not be sufficient to 
adequately characterize AUC0-inf given the uncertainty around the half-life in healthy volunteers. However, the 
choice of an interval of 57 days allows covering at least 80% of the AUC since the extrapolated AUC was less than 
20% in all of the pharmacokinetic evaluable subjects (%Mean AUCextrap ±SD 0.7047±1.235, 0.7061±0.8511 
and 0.7937±0.8122 for HLX02, for the US-sourced Herceptin and the EU-sourced Herceptin respectively). 
The results obtained from the PK comparability study (HLX02-HV01) concluded that HLX02 is bioequivalent with 
both EU-sourced and CN-sourced Herceptin since the 90% CIs for the primary PK parameter AUC0-inf and 
secondary PK parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC0-t) fall within the pre-defined bioequivalence limits of 0.8 to 1.25. 
The tmax for the HLX02 and two reference products were not statistically significantly different. In addition, 
bioequivalence was also confirmed between the EU-sourced Herceptin and US-sourced Herceptin. 
An additional statistical analysis was performed for the secondary PK parameters (Vz, CL, and t1/2). PK 
parameters were calculated based on uncorrected and corrected serum concentration data, respectively. 
Geometric means ratio and 90% CI were calculated between HLX02 vs. CN-sourced Herceptin, HLX02 vs. 
EU-sourced Herceptin, and CN-sourced vs. EU-sourced Herceptin. All measured PK parameters (Vz, CL, and t1/2) 
fell within the predefined bioequivalence margin of 0.8 to 1.25. 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 69/153 
 
  
  
 
It was noted that the measured protein concentrations of EU Herceptin and CN Herceptin differed from the 
concentration of HLX02 by more than 5%. However, this difference is not expected to impact the conclusions of 
bioequivalence since the PK analysis has been carried both on corrected and uncorrected serum concentration 
data and in both cases, the 90% confidence intervals around the point estimates of the “test/reference” least 
squares mean ratios of the primary PK parameter AUCinf and secondary PK parameters AUClast and Cmax were 
within the acceptance range of 80-125%. 
A PK analysis with data collected in study HLX02-BC01 was also submitted. In the overall population, from Cycle 
1 to Cycle 15 both treatments, HLX02 and Herceptin showed similar mean serum concentration-time profiles. 
Slight differences have been observed between Asian and non-Asian population for the pre-infusion at Cycle 1 
and Cycle 9 regardless of treatment arm. At these time points there were also slight differences between 
treatments in non-Asian population. This could be explained by limited number of non-Asian patients. 
Ten subjects were found to have quantifiable concentrations of trastuzumab at pre-dose of Cycle 1 for Zercepac 
(n>=LLOQ: 27) and Herceptin (n>=LLOQ: 22). The applicant explained that repeated tests were performed by 
the laboratory and it was confirmed there was no sample mix-up error during the sample analysis. Hence, it is 
highly likely that the samples were mis-labelled during sample collection. The rationale given by the applicant to 
explain the quantifiable concentrations of trastuzumab observed at pre-dose of Cycle 1 for Zercepac and 
Herceptin in study HLX02-BC01 is deemed plausible. In addition, the applicant has conducted a sensitivity 
analysis excluding the subjects with trastuzumab concentration above LLOQ before first dose. In this analysis, 
all geometric mean ratios of HLX02 and Herceptin concentration, as well as their 90% CI fell within 80%-125% 
with the exception of Cycle 3. The geometric mean ratio of cycle 3 concentration (75.788%) fell below the lower 
boundary of 80%-125%, but within the widened range 70%-143%, with 90% CI of 68.09%-84.36%. 
Comparing to the other 8 sampling points that fulfil the bioequivalent criteria, a single data exceeding 
bioequivalent limit might be considered minor and acceptable.  
Given the high variability linked to disease and to therapy, no reasonable bioequivalence approach can be 
proposed for a parallel group design in phase III trials in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Therefore, the 
PK results presented from the phase III are overall judged acceptable. Bioequivalence has been adequately 
demonstrated in study HLX02-HV01 which is the pivotal study in PK.   
In the population PK model report model parameters were predicted with acceptable precision. GOF plots of the 
final PopPK model seem to show a good agreement between the predicted concentrations and the observed 
concentrations. No bias was apparent in the residual plots over time and across predicted concentrations. 
Prediction corrected visual predictive check (PcVPC) suggested that the final PopPK model adequately predicts 
the central tendency and variability of the plasma HLX02 and Herceptin concentrations in subjects across all 
studies even if a slightly over-prediction on 97.5%ile of the observed values can be confirmed for HLX02 and 
Herceptin during the first 240 hours.  
According to the final population PK model, health status, race, shed antigen and body weight were found to 
significantly influence drug CL whereas volume of distribution was influenced by body weight. ADA and NAb were 
not tested during the modelling exercise due to the limited number of individuals tested positive. While graphical 
comparisons displayed differences between HLX02 and Herceptin patients, it is agreed that the limited number 
of positive patients precludes any robust conclusion.   
Subjects with higher shed antigen demonstrated lower AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss in both arms, however, the 
impact of shed antigen on exposure was less than 15%. Additionally, although several statistically significant 
differences (p<0.01) were stated, box plots were overall overlapped (data not shown). Therefore, differences 
observed between patients with shed ≤ median and shed > median are not considered clinically relevant.

Regarding the comparison of model predicted parameters for HLX02 and Herceptin in healthy vs patients and in 
Asians vs non-Asians, the geometric means for all the relevant PK parameters were lower for HLX02 as 
compared to Herceptin.  
At the request of the CHMP and to investigate the differences in drug exposures, the Applicant provided the 
figures of the 90% CI of the two one side test (as per bioequivalence guideline) on the model predicted (or 
simulated) relevant PK parameters/metrics in Asian and non-Asian patients. The applicant has shown the 
robustness of popPK model at two orthogonal levels: 1. pcVPC diagnosis based on phase I and III studies as a 
whole and pcVPC diagnosis by phase I or phase III study separately 2. EBEs based diagnostics. Taken together, 
the final popPK model was adequately evaluated and diagnosed using graphical pcVPC and EBE based 
diagnostics. Exposure ratios of Asian and non-Asian patients, as well as AUCss and Cmax,ss were still within 
80-125% range for both HLX02 and Herceptin, even with no body weight adjustments. 
The mechanism of action of trastuzumab is well established. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand 
independent HER2 signalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation 
mechanism of HER2. As a consequence, proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2 is inhibited 
(see SmPC section 5.1). Studies on the mechanism of action were not provided, which is acceptable for a 
biosimilar product application. 
No pharmacodynamics comparison between treatments (i.e. percent decrease from baseline of serum HER2 
concentration) have been conducted. However, as no validated pharmacodynamics biomarker has been 
established for Herceptin so far, this approach is considered acceptable. 
Immunogenicity data are discussed under section 2.6.1. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, PK results support demonstration of biosimilarity between HLX02 and Herceptin.

Treatments 
Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: 
Arm A, HLX02 (IV) + docetaxel (IV), or Arm B, EU-sourced Herceptin (IV) + docetaxel (IV) 
•  HLX02 or Herceptin: a loading dose of 8 mg/kg over 90 minutes, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks 
over 30-90 minutes (i.e. any duration between 30 and 90 minutes from Cycle 2 onwards) if the previous 
dose was well tolerated, on Day 1 of each cycle. 
•  Docetaxel: dose of 75 mg/m² administered on Day 2, Cycle 1 over 60 minutes, then every 3 weeks 
on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle after HLX02 or Herceptin. Dose increase to 100 mg/m² for patients 
who tolerated at least 1 administration at 75 mg/m². Dexamethasone was given as premedication at 
oral dose of 7.5-8 mg or IV dose of 20 mg dexamethasone until Herceptin/HLX02 have been stopped 
and if they have been previously tolerated. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor may be used according 
to the prescribing information for docetaxel but not as prophylaxis before the first cycle. 
Duration of treatment with HLX02 or Herceptin: a maximum of 12 months (17 cycles), or until 
Investigator-assessed disease progression, excessive toxicity, Investigator’s judgment, withdrawal of consent, 
lost to follow-up, death, start of a new anticancer therapy, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever 
occurs first. 
Duration of treatment with docetaxel 75 mg/m2: at least 8 cycles (24 weeks) unless there is disease 
progression or excessive toxicity. Then continuation is at the discretion of the Investigator.

Exploratory Objective 
•  To explore population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis (not included in the interim analysis) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
•  ORR24 (overall response rate at Week 24), calculated as the proportion of patients with a best response 
of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from first assessment up to Week 24 according to 
RECIST 1.1. Overall tumour response was assessed by blinded, independent CIR according to RECIST 
1.1, without confirmation. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
• ORR (overall response rate) at Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24.  
• DoR (duration of response), defined as the time from first documentation of CR or PR to the first 
documentation of progression. After Week 24, assessments were made by the Investigator.  
• DCR (disease control rate), defined as the proportion of patients who achieved CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) 
of at least 12 weeks.  
• CBR (clinical benefit rate), defined as the proportion of patients who achieved CR, PR, or durable SD (SD ≥24 
weeks). 
• PFS (progression-free survival) up to 12 months, defined as the probability of being alive without documented 
progression up to 12 months after randomization, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
• OS (Overall survival) at 12, 24, and 36 months, defined as the probability of being alive 12, 24, and 36 months 
after randomization, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Randomisation  
Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive HLX02 plus docetaxel or EU Herceptin plus docetaxel. A complete 
block randomization scheme was applied.

The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR up to week 24 derived from the CIR (central imaging review). To yield 
a 84% power to demonstrate equivalence between HLX02 and EU-Herceptin on the primary ORR analysis 
(difference in rate of ORR, Herceptin - control) with the pre-defined equivalence limits of [-0.1350, 0.1350], a 
sample size of 578 patients (289 per arm) was required. Assuming a 5% dropout rate, the sample size was 
increased to 608 patients (304 per arm). This sample size calculation assumed a conservative ORR rate of 60 %. 
This rate was based on ORRs from 3 studies: Marty et al, 2005 (61%), CLEOPATRA (Baselga et al, 2012) (69%), 
and HERITAGE (Rugo et al, 2017) (69.6%). 
The ORR difference was to be analysed with a two-sided 95%CI (alpha controlled ≤0.05). If the 95% CI 
completely falls in an equivalence region defined as -13.5% - 13.5%, then the equivalence can be declared.  
•  Equivalence margin 
The applicant identified 2 published randomised studies comparing ORR following treatment with Herceptin + 
‘paclitaxel or equivalent’, versus ‘paclitaxel or equivalent alone’ (Herceptin US labelling text, Table 9; Marty M, 
et al, Table 2). The results of the subgroup of patients with HER2-positive tumours defined as FISH positive or 
IHC 2+ and 3+ have been pooled. 
The equivalence margin was derived using a random-effect meta-analysis of these two historical trastuzumab 
trials to estimate the treatment effect of trastuzumab with ‘paclitaxel or equivalent alone’ versus ‘paclitaxel or 
equivalent alone’. The Der Simonian-Laird (Der Simonian R, et al) estimate random effect model approach was 
used for the meta-analysis. Using this approach, the difference in ORR and its 95% CI was estimated to be 
0.2493 [0.1579; 0.3407]. The metabin function of the meta library of the R language was used to implement 
this estimate. 
An equivalence limit tighter than the lower bound of this confidence interval is used as the criterion of 
equivalence: [-0.1350, 0.1350]. 
•  Analysis Sets/Populations 
• Enrolled set (ENR) contained all patients who provided informed consent for this study.  
• Intent-to-treat set (ITT) contained all patients who were randomized. The intention-to-treat principle was 
preserved.  
• Safety analysis set (SAS) comprised all patients who received study drug (HLX02 or EU-sourced Herceptin) 
once. The SAS set were used for analysis of safety endpoints.  
• Per-protocol (PP) analysis set comprised all patients who had at least 8 cycles of treatment and had at least 1 
tumor measurement after treatment, or discontinued treatment early due to Investigator-assessed disease 
progression or excessive toxicity and did not have major protocol deviations/violations (such as not receiving 
Docetaxel). The ITT and PP sets were used for analyses of ORR, PFS, OS, DoR, CBR, and DCR.  
• PK analysis set (PKAS) comprised all patients who received study drug and who had at least 1 measured 
concentration at a scheduled PK time point after the start of study drug without any protocol deviations or 
events which might affect the PK results. 
•  General Approaches 
Continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics, i.e., number of patients (n), mean, median, 
standard deviation, 25th and 75th percentiles (Q1, Q3), minimum and maximum. Qualitative variables were 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 76/153 
 
  
  
 
 
summarized by counts and percentages. For statistical tests, the default significance level was 2-sided 5%; 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented and all tests were 2-sided unless otherwise specified. All 
analyses, summaries, and listings were performed using SAS software (Version 9.4 or higher).  
1- Primary efficacy analysis: Primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. The Per-Protocol 
population was used as a supportive analysis population for efficacy. The primary endpoint was ORRwk24, the 
risk difference in ORR (HLX02/EU-sourced Herceptin) between the 2 treatment groups was calculated using a 
Chi-squared test and 95% Wald Cis were presented. Equivalence would be declared if the two-sided 95% CI for 
the difference of ORR is completely within the equivalence range of (-13.5%; 13.5%) 
2- Secondary efficacy analyses: Time-to-event secondary efficacy variables of DoR, PFS up to 12 months and at 
12 months, OS at 12, 24, and 36 months and OS up to the cut off date are to be estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Curves together with a summary of associated statistics (ie, the probability of being 
event-free) and corresponding 2-sided 95% Cis were presented. The CIs for the survival function estimated at 
the time points defined above were derived using the log-log transformation according to Kalbfleisch and 
Prentice. The estimate of the standard error was computed using Greenwood’s formula. A Cox model was used 
to compare the hazard ratio (HR). The point estimates and 95% CIs of the HR were reported. 
The ITT and PP will be used for analyses of ORR, PFS, OS, DoR, CBR, and DCR. 
•  Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were performed on the primary endpoint of ORR in the PP population. The treatment 
difference was characterized by the “HLX02/Herceptin” HR estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model. HR with its p-value and corresponding 95% CI were presented. 
Sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of conclusions to missing data was planned to be carried out if there 
are more than 5% of patients missing evaluations in either treatment arm. 
• 
Interim analysis 
Interim analysis was planned after the primary efficacy data at Week 24 are available for all patients. There was 
a first database lock and the designated unblinded study team conducted analyses on the primary efficacy data, 
as well as PK, safety/immunogenicity and survival data, up to Week 24.  
All Investigators, site teams, and patients remain blinded for the rest of the Treatment Period (up to 12 months 
after the last patient randomized), which is when the second database lock will occur. 
A blinded sample size re-estimation procedure was planned after the primary efficacy data at Week 24 become 
available in the first 300 patients. A Data Monitoring Committee oversees the re-estimation procedure as well as 
review safety data and monitors the overall conduct of the study. 
The final version 5 of the SAP is dated 25 December 2018.  
Results

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The version of study protocol that was originally submitted to and instituted in EC was Version 2.0. Version 2.0 
was instituted before the first patient was enrolled. As of cut-off date, the protocol had been amended 3 times. 
Brief summaries of the non-administrative changes are outlined below. 
Protocol Version 3.0 dated 14 October 2016 implemented the following changes: 
- Tumor assessments changed from every 9 weeks (3 cycles) to every 6 weeks (2 cycles) to ensure tumour 
assessments were at regular intervals up to the new primary endpoint of Week 24. 
- The removal of Extension Study. 
- Duration of follow-up period revised to 36 months after randomization. 
- In accordance with EMA Scientific Advice, the primary endpoint has been changed: the primary endpoint 
changed from Week 18 to Week 24 to improve the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis in accordance with 
EMA Scientific Advice. 
- Stratification factors changed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 80/153 
 
  
  
 
 
 
- Increase in sample size to ensure power in the study and to reflect the change of the primary efficacy analysis 
to the ITT population; the interim blinded evaluation deleted because the sample size was considered sufficient 
to achieve the desired power. 
- Deleting the inclusion of patients who had received prior first line anti-hormonal treatment for metastatic 
disease, in accordance with the EMA Scientific Advice; 
- The statistical methods section (PK) updated to include shed antigen (in accordance with EMA Scientific 
Advice). 
- A fasting glucose test at baseline has added to discover any patients with undiagnosed diabetes. 
- Confirmation of HER2-overexpression based on FISH further clarified to add gene copies. 
Protocol Version 4.0 dated 17 May 2017 implemented the following changes: 
- Primary objective updated to “ORR up to Week 24” from “ORR at Week 24” to be consistent with the ORR 
evaluation as reported in the reference trials; primary endpoint updated accordingly 
The endpoint of ORR up to 12 months removed 
- Clarification added that a CIR was not necessary after Week 24 because efficacy endpoints after this time were 
secondary. 
- To demonstrate the pattern of response was equivalent in both arms, ORR added at 6-week intervals up to 
Week 24. 
- The endpoint of ORR at end of treatment removed; DoR added. 
- Changes to the in/exclusion criteria including: 
o  Change to the inclusion criterion regarding the various disease-free intervals after different prior 
therapy 
o 
In/Exclusion criteria changed to allow men with breast cancer into the study and, as a result, a 
criterion added on contraception for male patients and their partners 
o  The criterion of gene copies >4 removed 
o  Requirement on the stop details of prior hormone therapy removed 
o  A requirement added on the disease-free interval with regard to prior therapy 
- A blinded sample size re-estimation procedure was added to increase the chance of meeting the required 
power to show equivalence 
- The frequency of ECG measurements changed from 3 cycles to every cycle  
Protocol Version 5.0 dated 17 July 2017 implemented the following changes: 
- The details and frequency of pregnancy testing updated in accordance with the European Clinical Trial 
Facilitation Group recommendation on contraception and pregnancy testing 
- Inclusion Criterion 11 updated to be consistent with docetaxel label restrictions and to allow patients with liver 
metastases to be enrolled and have access to effective therapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 81/153 
 
  
  
 
 
- It was clarified that if either trastuzumab or docetaxel was delayed due to toxicity, the other agent was also to 
be delayed 
No changes were made to the planned analyses after the finalization of the statistical analysis plan.

Overall, 66 (10.2%) patients presented with primary diagnosis at screening with local disease and 581 (89.5%) 
patients presented with metastatic disease, the majority of patients had stage IV disease (91.2%). Of total of 
144 (22.2%) patients slightly patients had more than 1 visceral metastasis at screening in HLX02 treatment 
group, with 67 (20.7%) patients, while there were 77 (23.7%) patients in Herceptin treatment group. One 
visceral metastasis at screening was detected in about half of patients, 175 (54.9 %) patients in HLX02 
treatment group and 157 (48.3%) patients in Herceptin treatment group. A total of 304 (46.8%) patients 
showed positive ER/PgR status in the study with corresponding proportion in HLX02 treatment group as 149 
(46.0%), in Herceptin treatment group as 155 (47.7%), with similar proportions by ER and PgR status. Other 
baseline disease characteristics (clinical and pathological TNM stage, staging of primary tumour nodal 
involvement and presence of metastases at screening) appear balanced between the groups.

Outcomes and estimation 
The data provided in Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) were based on the cut-off date 23 November 
2018 when the primary efficacy data at Week 24 were available for all patients. Data from the second interim 
analysis (DCO 10 July 2019) were also provided. 
The date for the database lock for first interim analysis was 29 Dec 2018 (cut-off date 27 Nov 2018).  
The date for the database lock for second interim analysis is 16 Aug 2019 (cut-off date 10 July 2019). 
Primary efficacy endpoint: ORR24 
Similarity between HLX02 and EU Herceptin was statistically demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint, 
ORR24 (as the proportion of patients with a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) 
from first assessment up to Week 24 according to RECIST 1.1) assessed by central imaging review (CIR) in ITT 
set. Overall, the efficacy of primary endpoint, ORR24, assessed by CIR was similar between the 2 treatment 
groups after completion of up to 8 cycles of treatment. 
Table 44: Analysis Overall Response Rate (ORR) up to Week 24 by central imaging review (CIR) in 
ITT set (First interim analysis- data cut-off: 23 Nov 2018) 
ORR24 was 71% in HLX02 treatment group and 71.4% in Herceptin treatment group. The proportion of patients 
with complete response (CR) were 17 (5.2%) in HLX02 treatment group versus 12 (3.7%) in Herceptin 
treatment group. Similar proportion of patients in both treatment groups had partial response (PR): 213 
(65.7%) patients in HLX02 treatment group and 220 (67.7%) patients in Herceptin treatment group. 
The analysis of ORR derived from central radiology assessments showed a risk difference of the ORR between 
the 2 treatment groups was -0.4% (95% CI: -7.4%, 6.6%) (HLX02 minus EU Herceptin). The 95% CI was within 
the pre-specified equivalence margin of -13.5% to 13.5%.

Sensitivity analyses 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis 
result at first interim analysis (data cut-off: 23 Nov 2018): 
1)  The adjusted risk difference in ORR (HLX02/Herceptin) between the 2 treatment groups was -0.2 as 
calculated using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and 95% Wald CIs were -7.2% and 
6.8% (p-value of 0.952), within the equivalence margin.  
2)  The ORR derived from CIR – Per Protocol Population. The risk difference of the ORR between the two 
treatments groups was 0.8, with 95%CI being -6.2% and 7.7%. The 95% CI is within the recommended 
equivalence margin of -13.5% to 13.5%.

3)  The ORR derived from Investigator Assessments- ITT Population. The risk difference of the ORR 
between the two treatments groups was 2.7, with 95%CI being -4.4% and 9.8%. The 95% CI is within 
the recommended equivalence margin of -13.5% to 13.5%.

cut-off: 23 Nov 2018) 
4) ORR analysis in the ITT set where patients with missing ORR assessment were regarded as non-responders. 
Patients with missing ORR assessment were regarded as non-responders. As the result of the second interim 
analysis, ORRwk24 was 71.3% in HLX02 treatment group and 71.4% in Herceptin treatment group. No 
statistical difference was found between 2 treatment groups (p=0.983). Equivalence was concluded as the 
2-sided 95% CI of the risk difference in the 2 proportions (-0.1% [-7.0%, 6.9%]) was completely contained 
within predefined equivalence boundaries [-0.1350; 0.1350].

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
HLX02 is proposed as a biosimilar to Herceptin. Herceptin is authorised in metastatic and early breast cancer 
settings as well as in gastric cancer. The applicant is applying for the same indications as Herceptin, even though 
from an efficacy point of view, the clinical development has been carried out on metastatic breast cancer. 
The assessment of similarity in terms of efficacy between Zercepac (HLX02) and EU-sourced Herceptin is based 
on Study HLX02-BC01. 
Study HLX02-BC01 is a double-blind, randomized, Phase 3, parallel-group clinical study evaluating the efficacy, 
safety, PK and immunogenicity of HLX02 in combination with docetaxel versus trastuzumab-EU with docetaxel 
in patients aged 18 years and over with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in the first-line treatment 
setting. Patients were stratified for estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, prior 
neo-/adjuvant therapy with EU-sourced Herceptin, and ethnicity (Asian and non-Asian). HLX02 and 
EU-Herceptin were both administered in combination with docetaxel for 8 cycles (24 weeks) and then continued 
as monotherapy for up to 17 cycles (about 12 months).  
The evaluation of tumour response was measured according to RECIST 1.1. The Principal Investigator assessed 
the response every 6 weeks up to 24 weeks (regardless of the number of cycles actual given); thereafter, 
assessments were done every 9 weeks (after Cycles 11, 14, and 17) or earlier in the case of clinical signs of 
progression. Tumour response for the primary efficacy analysis were evaluated by central imaging review (CIR). 
No CIR was required after Week 24. All patients were to remain in the study until principal investigator-assessed 
disease progression, excessive toxicity, Investigator’s judgment, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, 
death, start of a new anticancer therapy, study termination by the sponsor, or for a maximum of 12 months of

treatment, whichever occurring first. The ORR difference between HLX02 and EU-Herceptin was analysed with a 
two-sided 95%CI. The equivalence would be declared if the 95% CI completely falls in an equivalence margin 
defined as (-13.5%; 13.5%).  
This study is still ongoing. Data on a planned interim analysis when the primary efficacy data at Week 24 were 
available for all patients were submitted with the initial data package (cut-off date: 23 Nov 2018 and database 
lock: 29 Dec 2018). This interim analysis consisted of the primary efficacy analysis and analyses of evaluable 
secondary efficacy endpoints. By this cut-off date, 132 patients had completed, 215 were ongoing in the 
treatment and 302 had discontinued from the treatment. 
The second planned interim analysis was performed when all efficacy data, as well as PK, safety/immunogenicity 
and survival data, up to 12 months were available for all patients (database lock: 16 Aug 2019; cut-off date: 10 
Jul 2019). Up to the second interim analysis, a total of 292 (45.0%) patients completed the study treatment 
(155 [47.8%] in the HLX02 and 137 [42.2%] in the Herceptin); and 357 (55.0%) patients had discontinued the 
study treatment (169 [52.2%] in the HLX02 and 188 [57.8%] in the Herceptin); no patients were ongoing under 
treatment as of the cut-off date. Median total exposure duration was close to 1 year (312 days in the HLX02 and 
292.0 days in the Herceptin). End of study is planned at 36 months after the last patient being randomized. 
Dosing and concomitant therapy  
Docetaxel was chosen for combination therapy with HLX02 or EU-Herceptin. This choice is supported from the 
comparability exercise perspective and would result in a more homogenous patient population. The dose of 
docetaxel used was 75 mg/m2 paclitaxel with dose escalation to 100 mg/m2 (as per Baselga et al, 2012; Swain 
et al, 2015, CLEOPARTA study) and not in line with the docetaxel label (100 mg/m2). However, this dosage is 
widely used and have been justified by improved safety and tolerability. It is considered acceptable as the same 
dosing regimen was employed in two arms. 
Target population and Eligibility criteria 
As mentioned in the scientific advice, whilst the choice of patients’ population for this clinical comparability is 
acceptable and is in line with the approved indication, the metastatic setting may not provide the most sensitive 
model out of all available choices. The choice of the metastatic breast cancer (mBC) over the early breast cancer 
(eBC) setting is not considered as the most optimal in terms of the expected homogeneity of patient population 
or its sensitivity to respond to HER2-targeting therapy that is generally used in first instance in the 
(neo-)adjuvant setting. The first line metastatic setting is nevertheless acceptable to address the clinical efficacy 
similarity. The choice of metastatic setting over early breast cancer setting was also determined by the fact that 
the neo-adjuvant setting is not approved for eBC in China, where the majority of patients were planned to be 
enrolled. HER2 targeted therapy is not widely used in China in (neo-) adjuvant setting and the availability of the 
currently recommended combination treatments in 1L metastatic setting may be limited. Therefore, the CHMP 
agreed with the selected MBC patient population. 
Overall, the study population is considered representative of an approved therapeutic indication for Herceptin. 
Key in- and exclusion criteria were discussed in the context of scientific advice. Inclusion of patients that have 
completed adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment > 12 months earlier was considered adequate. Inclusion of 
patients with stable / treated brain metastases was endorsed. However, inclusion of patients that have received 
prior 1st line anti-hormonal treatment for metastatic disease was not considered advisable. First line 
anti-hormonal treatment was mainly (only) applicable in case of limited disease or bone only metastatic disease 
(non-measurable and thus not applicable for this study) and when one chooses 1st line anti-hormonal treatment 
this was generally in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) which was not in agreement with the protocol.

Considering the limited number of patients included under modified disease-free interval criteria, the impact on 
results does not seem to be clinically relevant. 
Limitation for the prior cumulative dose of anthracyclines is noted, seemingly only one patient in each arm had 
prior/concomitant doxorubicin exposure. 
The central confirmation of HER2 overexpression status is supported and would improve sensitivity of the 
patient population. This status was assessed by central laboratory before randomisation to confirm eligibility 
using a FISH or IHC test, i.e. patients with a previous local IHC score of 2+ must have been tested centrally by 
FISH and those patients with a previous local IHC score of 3+ must be confirmed centrally by IHC.  
Sample size and equivalence margin 
The sample size calculations were based on the primary efficacy endpoint ORRwk24. This sample size calculation 
assumed a conservative ORR rate of 60% which was based on ORR results from 3 studies: Marty et al, 2005 
(61%), CLEOPATRA (Baselga et al, 2012) (69%), and HERITAGE study with a biosimilar (Rugo et al, 2017) 
(69.6%).  
Only two studies have been used for meta-analysis and the scientific advice have not been followed. The 
relevance of the two studies chosen for a meta-analysis (Phase 2 Study M77001 of Marty et al, 2005; Study 
H0648 reported in the FDA label for Herceptin) with the purpose of the equivalence margin calculation was also 
questioned at the time of the scientific advice in 2016.  
The ORR difference was to be analysed with a two-sided 95%CI (alpha controlled ≤0.05). If the 95% CI 
completely falls in an equivalence region defined as (-13.5% to +13.5%), then the equivalence would be 
declared. The Applicant took into consideration the scientific advice recommendation and intermediate steps of 
the equivalence margin calculation were requested to be clarified.  
The random-effect approach was used to define the difference in ORR and its 95%CI. This approach gives 
relatively wider CI than a fixed-effects approach, which appear nevertheless not much different based on the 
details that were provided on calculations on the metabin function of the meta library of the R language that was 
used to implement the calculated estimate and on the overall statistical methodology for the equivalence margin 
calculation.  
Overall, the clinical relevance on this equivalence range was discussed and the overall approach is considered 
acceptable, although not optimal, to justify the chosen margins at this point. 
It is acknowledged that under this approach, unpowered PFS and/or OS estimations would be likely obtained in 
the final analysis. Long-term data on PFS and OS were nevertheless requested. In the second interim analysis 
no significant difference was found between two treatment groups in terms of median DoR, PFS and OS despite 
of the immature data, which partly supported the primary results (see discussion further below).  
It is noted that for equivalence study, PP population is usually recommended for primary analysis since low 
heterogeneity lead to increase the sensitivity of the study to identify any potential differences. However, as both 
ITT and PP populations have been calculated and powered, the applicant approach is accepted. 
According to the applicant’s report, there were no multiple comparison or multiplicity issues in this study as the 
primary comparison was between HLX02 and Herceptin treatment for the primary efficacy variable of ITT using 
a Chi-squared test and 95% Wald CIs.  
Randomisation 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 115/153 
 
  
  
 
The stratification factors included ER/PgR status and prior neo-/adjuvant therapy with Herceptin, to balance the 
prognostic variables between two treatment groups and also race (Asian and non-Asian). The stratification by 
tumour burden could have been considered. 
Stratification of patients according to prior adjuvant therapy was considered adequate at the time of scientific 
advice as patients with metastatic breast cancer may have previously received Herceptin in the neo-/adjuvant 
setting and have baseline anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). 
Primary and secondary endpoints 
The overall response rate (ORR) is deemed as a sensitive endpoint to demonstrate the similarity between the 
biosimilar and reference product, as recommended by EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). The 
initial proposed ORR after 6 cycles (18 weeks) was not advisable per CHMP scientific advice because some 
patients need more cycles to respond based on the results of other trials. Therefore, ORR at 24 weeks (after 8 
cycles) was recommended to confirm the response as the primary endpoint in the study. There was no provision 
for confirmation of responses and this point has not been discussed during scientific advice. 
Proposed secondary endpoints included DoR, CBR, PFS, DCR and OS are considered acceptable. The analysis of 
the time to response is considered informative and the results have been provided with the updated efficacy 
report.  
The primary assessment and sensitivity analyses were conducted in both Intent-to-treat (ITT) population and 
the Per-Protocol (PP) population. Since the predominant recruitment population are in Asia, subgroup analyses 
(non-Asian and Asian population) were also reported. 
Conduct of the study 
The study was initiated (first patient enrolled) on 11 November 2016. The first protocol amendment (version 3) 
was implemented previously to start the study (14 October 2016). Thus, these modifications do not seem to bias 
the study. In total, only 1.2% patients were excluded from the study due to major protocol deviations. The 
major protocol deviations leading to exclusion from ITT population appear slightly imbalanced, however 
absolute total numbers are low and have minor impact on the final results. 
The blinded sample size re-estimation procedure was planned in the SAP after 300 patients have been evaluated 
for response at Week 24 to ensure at least 80% power (using the conditional power from the observed ORR 
difference and adjusting considering the actual dropout rate observed during this period). The procedure was 
overseen by a Data Monitoring Committee. It was concluded that there was no need for such re-estimation.  
Baseline characteristics 
Overall, the baseline characteristics of patients and disease were comparable between two arms. The majority 
of patients were Asian (mainly Chinese). This was not considered to be of concern at the time of the scientific 
advice. However, stratification by race has been encouraged. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
By the cut-off date (27 November 2018), the pivotal trial met the primary endpoint at the first interim analysis. 
The difference in ORR (HLX02 minus Herceptin) between the 2 treatments was -0.4 % with 95%CI of -7.4 % to 
6.6%. The 95% CI was within the pre-specified equivalence margin of -13.5% to 13.5%. 
The ORR up to 24 weeks in ITT set was 71.0% (230 of 324 patients) (95% CI, 66.0, 75.9) for HLX02 and 71.4% 
(232 of 325 patients) (95% CI, 66.5, 76.3) for Herceptin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 116/153 
 
  
  
 
The results from primary analysis are supported by the results of several sensitivity analyses: 
- 
The 95%CI of the risk difference in ORR adjusted for stratification factors was (-7.2%; 6.8%) 
-  Risk difference in ORR analysis in the PP population yielded the 95%CI of (-6.2% and 7.7%) 
-  Risk difference in ORR analysis based on investigator assessments resulted in 95%CI of (-4.4% and 
9.8%) 
The risk difference in ORR from all of the sensitivity analyses was therefore fully contained within the 95% CI 
boundaries of the pre-specified equivalence margin (-13.5%, 13.5%). 
In Asian patients, the ORR difference was 1.7 % and the 95%CI of (-6.3%; 9.6%) was contained within the 
boundaries of the pre-defined margin of ±13.5%. 
In the non-Asian subgroup, ORR up to 24 weeks in Herceptin arm (74.3%) was higher than that in HLX02 arm 
(67.1%), with a difference of -7.2%. The 95%CI was (-21.7%; 7.3%), thus the lower boundary of the reported 
95%CI fell outside of the pre-defined margin of ±13.5%.  
According to the published literature, efficacy profiles of HLX02 and Herceptin are not deemed to differ among 
different ethnicity including Asian and non-Asian population. Nevertheless, heterogeneity in ORR risk difference 
was observed in the subgroups by race. The subgroup of non-Asian patients is smaller (76 patients in the HLX02 
arm, 74 patients in the Herceptin arm) what may explain the results.  
The secondary efficacy analyses of CBR, DCR supported the primary analysis.  
As to the secondary analysis of ORR by week 6, 12, 18 and 24 to assess the pattern of ORR changes, some 
discrepancies have been noticed in the provided analyses and were clarified. Furthermore, the change in the 
primary objective from ORR ‘at Week 24’ to ORR ‘up to 24 weeks’ that was implemented with protocol 
amendment 4 was only for clarification because the expression was misleading. Overall, the choice of the ORR 
‘up to week 24’ instead of ‘at week 24’ was justified considering the occurrence of response all along the 
24-week period instead of at one 24-week point would be more sensitive for detecting differences between 
arms.  
Although the results from the concordance analysis indicated that there were no statistical significant differences 
between ORR at all time points assessed by CIR and by investigators, a trend of their risk difference beyond the 
pre-defined equivalence boundaries at week 18, 24 was reported. Furthermore, a statistically significant 
difference on the ORR assessed by the investigators at week 33 (corresponding to confirmation of the response) 
between the two treatment groups was also observed. For the subpopulation of non-Asian patients, the 
ORRwk24 difference assessed by CIR was -8.1% (95% CI: -22.5%, 6.3%) with the left side out of the lower 
boundary of the equivalence margin. It was 1.1% (-6.0%, 8.1%), which was well contained within the 
equivalence margin, when assessed by investigators. HRs for OS and PFS did not support this trend and were 
0.84 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.04) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.82), respectively. The ORR assessed by CIR might be 
caused by systematic sampling error due to small sample size according to the applicant, but no definitive 
conclusion can be made in this regard.  
Although the analysis of other secondary endpoints of PFS, DOR and OS needs to attain higher degree of 
maturity, for all of these points numerically better efficacy was observed for HLX02, with HRs being lower than 
1 (0.75 for DOR, 0.83 for PFS and 0.80 for OS). There was a clear separation of KM curves for DOR and PFS, 
while for OS curves are superposing, but the data are still immature (about 10%). As these data were not 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 117/153 
 
  
  
 
consistent with the primary endpoint, an updated analysis was considered necessary to see whether this trend 
in favour of HLX02 maintained at the long term.  
Based on the results from the second interim analyses, a trend in favour of HLX02 was observed in the primary 
endpoint and ORR at week 33, 42 assessed by the investigators. No significant difference was found between 
two treatment groups in terms of median DoR, PFS and OS in the second interim analysis despite of the 
immature data, which partly supported the primary results. Of note, in subgroups analyses the patients at the 
age ≥50 in the HLX02 treatment group presented a favourable PFS trend compared with those in the Herceptin 
group. The estimated time for 24-month OS of last patient will be on 30 June 2020; the estimated time for 
36-month OS of last patient will be on 30 June 2021. The applicant is recommended to provide the final CSR 
including data of 24-month and 36-month OS. 
No studies were performed in special population which could be considered acceptable as no differences are 
expected from the reference drug. 
Immunogenicity data are discussed under section 2.6.1. 
Extrapolation 
Extrapolation of indication has been justified by the applicant based on the fact that the mechanism of action of 
trastuzumab is the same in all three indications and the target receptor involved is also the same in MBC, EBC 
and MGC. The dosage is also similar for all three indications, and trastuzumab is administered by the same route 
in all indications. Hence, extrapolation in terms of efficacy is supported by the results of the physicochemical, 
structural and biological characterisation data, results from the comparative preclinical studies (in vitro 
functional tests) together with PK comparability data. Extrapolation is also considered acceptable from a safety 
perspective. 
As only PK data on IV administration were submitted under this application (see clinical pharmacology section), 
only the IV route of administration can be authorised under this MA procedure (see SmPC section 4.2.). 
Medication errors due to subcutaneous administration have been classified as important identified risk in the 
RMP (see clinical safety). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study met its primary endpoint indicating similarity in term of efficacy between candidate biosimilar 
and the reference product. The provided sensitivity analyses supported the primary endpoint results. A trend in 
favour of HLX02 was observed in the primary endpoint and ORR at week 33, 42 assessed by the investigators. 
However, no significant difference was found between two treatment groups in terms of median DoR, PFS and 
OS in the second interim analysis despite of the immature data, partly supporting the primary results.  
In conclusion, clinical efficacy between HLX02 and Herceptin is considered to be similar. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In the two trials which provided clinical safety data, the Phase II HLX02-HV01 and the Phase III HLX02-BC01 
(hereafter referred to as HV01 and BC01 respectively), a total of 772 subjects were exposed at least once to 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 118/153 
 
  
  
 
 
HLX02 or Herceptin (US- and EU-sourced in case of the HV01 trial, EU-sourced in case of the BC01 study). This 
translates to 373 patients having received HLX02, 37 having received US-sourced Herceptin and 362 having 
received EU-sourced Herceptin. 
In part 1 of the HV01 trial, 12 patients received doses of 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg HLX02 (3 subjects per dose level) 
and in part 2, subjects were exposed as follows: 37 received HLX02, 37 received US-sourced Herceptin and 37 
received EU-sourced Herceptin. 
All subjects whom had received at least one administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP) or 
comparator were included in the respective HV01 part1, HV02 part2 and BC01 safety sets. 
All patients in the both HV01 safety sets were of Chinese ethnicity, male and between 18 and 45 years of age. 
In contrast, all patients in the BC01 trial were of female gender, with ages ranging from 26 to 76 years of age 
(mean age = 50 y.o.a.) and 72,9% were of Chinese ethnicity, 4,0% of Non-Chinese Asian ethnicity and 23,1% 
of Caucasian ethnicity. 
In the BC01 trial, as of 23 November 2018,  both treatment groups (HLX02 and EU-Herceptin) underwent about 
the same mean number of treatment cycles, but the HLX02 group had a higher mean total exposure (238.4 days 
versus 228.8 days in the Herceptin group) and consequently a higher cumulative dose exposure (median 4550.5 
mg versus 4200.0 mg respectively). 
By the second interim analysis (data cut-off date as of 10 July 2019), in the 649 SAS population (324 patients 
received HLX02 and 325 received Herceptin), the median number of cycles completed by patients was similar in 
the HLX02 treatment group (15) and the Herceptin treatment group (14). The total drug exposure duration of 
HLX02 group and Herceptin group was 264.6 (114.76) days and 253.4 (114.29) days. 
Overall and relative dose intensity were similar in both the treatment groups. The median cumulative dose of the 
study medication was 5488.5 mg (for HLX02) and 4945.0 mg (for Herceptin) treatment groups, respectively. 
Dose reduction was reported in 1 patient in Herceptin treatment group. Dose delay was reported in 55 patients 
in HLX02 treatment group and 46 patients in Herceptin treatment group. Dose interruption was reported in a 
total of 21 and 16 patients from the HLX02 and Herceptin treatment groups, respectively.

Adverse events 
Adverse event classification was done in a standard way and utilised MEdDRA v18.0 (HV01)/MEdDRA v21.1 
(BC01) and CTCAE v4.03. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were defined as being IRR (Infusion-related reactions) and cardiac 
toxicities in both studies HV01 and BC01, and additionally allergic-like reactions/hypersensitivity and 
haematological events in study BC01.

Six subjects (50%) experienced TEAEs of mild severity (1 subject from the 2 mg/kg group, 3 subjects from the 
4 mg/kg group, 1 subject from the 6 mg/kg group, and 1 subject from the 8 mg/kg group). Overall, at least 1 
TEAE of moderate severity was reported for 2 subjects (16.7%), 1 subject each in the 2 mg/kg group and 8 
mg/kg group.No AEs with CTCAE Grade ≥4 haematological toxicity, Grade ≥3 non-haematological toxicity 
(including IRRs) or serious unexpected AEs were reported.  
AEs of special interest 
AEs of special interest included IRR and cardiac toxicity. A total of 2 subjects experienced at least one TEAE of 
special interest associated with cardiac toxicity: 1 subject (33.3%) in the 2 mg/kg group experienced dilatation 
ventricular (mild in severity) and ejection fraction decreased (moderate in severity), and one subject (33.3%) in 
the 8 mg/kg group experienced left atrial dilatation (mild in severity). No TEAEs of special interest associated 
with IRR were reported.  
ADRs 
An ADR was defined as a TEAE with a probable, possible, or not assessable/unclassifiable relationship with study 
drug.

Phase 1 HLX02-HV01-Part 2: 
Across the 3 treatment groups, 86 subjects (77.5%) experienced a total of 283 AEs/276 TEAEs. Of these, 28 
subjects (75.7%) in the HLX02 group experienced 94 AEs/94 TEAEs, 32 subjects (86.5%) in the CN-sourced 
Herceptin group experienced 107 AEs/103 TEAEs, and 26 subjects (70.3%) in the EU-sourced Herceptin group 
experienced 82 AEs/79 TEAEs. A higher percentage of subjects in the CN-sourced Herceptin group had at least 
one TEAE compared with the HLX02 group and the EU-sourced Herceptin group. No deaths or SAEs were 
reported. No subjects were discontinued due to TEAEs.  
Table 68: Overview of adverse events (Safety set 2) in study HLX02-HV01 
In the overall 3 treatment groups, the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT (≥5% of subjects) were ALT 
increased, blood triglycerides increased (27.9% each), AST increased (23.4%), neutrophil count increased, 
white blood cell count increased (16.2% each), N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide increased 
(9.0%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, white blood cells urine positive (7.2% each), blood bilirubin 
increased, blood glucose increased, and glucose urine present (5.4% each).  
The following TEAEs were reported at a ≥10% frequency in the HLX02 group compared with the CN-sourced 
Herceptin group and the EU-sourced Herceptin group: neutrophil count increased (27.0% versus 16.2% and 
5.4%), white blood cell count increased (27.0% versus 16.2% and 5.4%), ALT increased (24.3% versus 37.8% 
and 21.6%), blood triglycerides increased (21.6% versus 29.7% and 32.4%), AST increased (18.9% versus 
29.7% and 21.6%), and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide increased (10.8% versus 8.1% and 
8.1%).  
In the overall 3 treatment groups, the most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC were investigations (69.4%), 
general disorders and administration site conditions and gastrointestinal disorders (4.5% each), and cardiac

reported TEAEs by SOC were investigations (73.0%) and gastrointestinal disorders (5.4%); in the CN-sourced 
Herceptin group, the most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC were investigations (70.3%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (5.4%), and general disorders and administration site conditions (5.4%); in the EU-Sourced Herceptin 
group, the most frequently reported TEAEs by SOC were investigations (64.9%), cardiac disorders (5.4%), 
general disorders and administration site conditions (5.4%), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(5.4%).

Most TEAEs in each treatment group were mild (56.8% in the HLX02 group, 59.5% in the CN-sourced Herceptin 
group, and 48.6% in the EU-sourced Herceptin group, respectively) or moderate (18.9% in the HLX02 group, 
18.9% in the CN-sourced Herceptin group, and 21.6% in the EU-sourced Herceptin group, respectively). Three 
subjects in the CN-sourced Herceptin group experienced at least 1 severe TEAE; no severe TEAEs were reported 
in the other 2 groups. 
No AEs with CTCAE Grade ≥4 hematological toxicity or serious unexpected AEs were reported. A total of 5 
subjects (4.5%) experienced at least one AE of CTCAE Grade ≥3 non-hematological toxicity (including IRRs; 2 
subjects experienced IRRs: 1 subject in CN-sourced Herceptin group and 1 subject in EU-sourced Herceptin 
group): 4 subjects (10.8%) in the CN-sourced Herceptin group and 1 subject (2.7%) in the EU-sourced 
Herceptin group.

TEAEs of special interest 
A total of 25 subjects (22.5%) experienced at least 1 TEAE of special interest. Similar results were seen in the 
HLX02 group (9 subjects, 24.3%), the CN-sourced Herceptin group (8 subjects, 21.6%), and the EU-sourced 
Herceptin group (8 subjects, 21.6%).  
In the overall 3 treatment groups, the most frequently reported TEAEs of special interest associated with cardiac 
toxicity (>2.0%) were N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide increased (10 subjects, 9.0%) and 
electrocardiogram T wave amplitude decreased (5 subjects, 4.5%), followed by all other TEAEs of special 
interest related with cardiac toxicity with a frequency of less than 2.0%. The TEAEs of special interest related 
with IRR were chill and pyrexia (2 subjects each, 1.8%).

Study BC01 
Of the 649 patients in the study, 641 (98.8%) patients were reported at least one AE (HLX02: 320 of 324 
[98.8%] patients; Herceptin: 321 of 325 [98.8%]). All of these patients also reported TEAEs. A similar number 
of AEs (HLX02=6975 vs Herceptin=7144) and TEAEs (HLX02=6828 and Herceptin=7002) were reported in the 
2 treatment groups. There were similar number of pre-treatment AEs reported in both the treatment groups.

Similar incidence of TEAEs was noted for total Asian (99.0%) and non-Asian (98.0%) populations, as well as for 
Chinese (98.9%), and non-Chinese (98.3%). The two treatment groups within the Asian and non-Asian 
populations, and within the Chinese and non-Chinese populations had similar incidence of the TEAEs.  
The most commonly reported SOCs were investigations (HLX02: 299 [92.3%] patients; Herceptin: 303 [93.2%] 
patients); skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (HLX02: 208 [64.2%] patients; Herceptin: 204 [62.8%]

patients); and blood and lymphatic system disorders (HLX02: 182 [56.2%] patients; Herceptin: 205 [63.1%] 
patients).  
The most commonly reported TEAEs by PT were WBC decreased (HLX02: 267 [82.4%] patients; Herceptin: 276 
[84.9%]), neutrophil count decreased (HLX02: 266 [82.1%] patients; Herceptin: 268 [82.5%]), alopecia 
(HLX02: 180 [55.6%] patients; Herceptin:174 [53.5%] patients) and anaemia (HLX02: 167 [51.5%] patients; 
Herceptin: 187 [57.5%] patients). In general, the incidence of TEAEs in HLX02 or Herceptin treated patients and 
frequency of occurrence was similar among both the treatment groups in overall population.

TEAEs of special interest 
A total of 518 (260 in HLX02 and 258 in Herceptin treatment group) patients were reported with 5934 AESIs. 
The most commonly reported SOCs were investigations (HLX02: 234 [72.2%] patients; Herceptin: 232 [71.4%] 
patients); and blood and lymphatic system disorders (HLX02: 141 [43.5%] patients; Herceptin: 155 [47.7%] 
patients). Most commonly reported AESIs were WBC decreased (HLX02: 225 [69.4%] patients; Herceptin: 224 
[68.9%] patients), neutrophil count decreased (HLX02: 214 [66.0%] patients; Herceptin: 209 [64.3%] 
patients); and anaemia (HLX02: 122 [37.7%] patients; Herceptin: 133 [40.9%] patients). In general, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 135/153 
 
  
  
 
 
incidence of AESIs in HLX02 or Herceptin treated patients and frequency of occurrence was similar among both 
the treatment groups in overall population. After the 1st database lock (29 December 2018), the incidence of 
Grade 4 AESIs in the HLX02 group was nearly 10% higher than that in the EU-Herceptin group. But after the 2nd 
database lock (16 August 2019), as the follow-up time increased, the difference between 2 groups was reduced 
(6%). 
As of cut-off date (10 July 2019), the longest time to special interest TEAE was observed in Herceptin treatment 
group for SOCs of metabolism and nutrition disorders (mean [SD] time taken was 16.93 [1.313] weeks) and 
respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (mean 16.71 weeks). There was no special interest TEAE for 
these SOCs observed in HLX02 treatment group at the time of this report. In Herceptin treatment group, the 
shortest time (0.14 weeks) to special interest TEAE observed was for SOC of general disorders and 
administration site conditions. In HLX02 treatment group, the longest time to special interest TEAE observed 
was for SOC of cardiac disorders (20.07 [15.402] weeks); the shortest time (0.56 [1.042] weeks) to special 
interest TEAE was observed for injury, poisoning and procedural complications. For overall population in both 
the treatment groups, longest time to special interest TEAEs (in weeks) was observed for cardiac disorders 
(overall=17.93 [13.747] weeks), in which the HLX02 treatment group (20.07 [15.402] weeks) had a longer 
duration for time to special interest TEAEs than the Herceptin treated patients (16.04 [12.269] weeks) 
The incidence of AESIs was higher in Asian population than the non-Asian population in both the treatment 
groups. A total of 478/499 Asian (HLX02: 238; Herceptin: 240) and 40/150 non-Asian (HLX02: 22; Herceptin: 
18) patients were reported with 5640 and 294 AESIs, respectively. The most commonly reported AESIs in Asian 
population were WBC decreased (HLX02: 208 [83.9%] patients; Herceptin: 214 [85.3%] patients), neutrophil 
count decreased (HLX02: 195 [78.6%] patients; Herceptin: 196 [78.1%] patients), and anaemia (HLX02: 117 
[47.2%] patients; Herceptin: 130 [51.8%] patients). In general, the incidence of AESIs in HLX02 or Herceptin 
treated patients and frequency of occurrence was similar among both the treatment groups in Asian patients. 
The most commonly reported AESIs in non-Asian population were neutrophil count decreased (HLX02: 19 
[25.0%] patients; Herceptin: 13 [17.6%] patients), WBC decreased (HLX02: 17 [22.4%] patients; Herceptin: 
10 [13.5%] patients). In general, the incidence of AESIs in HLX02 or Herceptin treated patients was similar 
among both the treatment groups in non-Asian patients. 
Both the Asian and non-Asian populations had the longest time to special interest TEAE observed for cardiac 
disorders and shortest time to special interest TEAE observed for injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications, respectively. Time to special interest TEAEs for cardiac disorders were similar between the 2 
treatment groups in the Asian population; however, in the non-Asian population, the HLX02 treated patients 
(30.95 [14.844] weeks) had a very longer time taken for special interest TEAEs than the Herceptin treatment 
group (14.00 [20.162] weeks). 
A total of 455 Chinese (HLX02: 228; Herceptin: 227) and 63 non-Chinese (HLX02: 32; Herceptin: 31) patients 
were reported with 5488 and 446 AESIs, respectively. The most commonly reported AESIs in Chinese population 
were WBC count decreased (HLX02: 203 [85.7%] patients; Herceptin: 203 [86.0%] patients), neutrophil count 
decreased (HLX02: 190 [80.2%] patients; Herceptin: 185 [78.4%] patients); and anaemia (HLX02: 115 
[48.5%] patients; Herceptin: 123 [52.1%] patients). 
The most commonly reported AESIs in non-Chinese population were neutrophil count decreased (HLX02: 24 
[27.6%] patients; Herceptin: 24 [27.0%] patients), WBC decreased (HLX02: 22 [25.3%] patients; Herceptin: 
21 [23.6%] patients). In general, the incidence of AESIs was similar among HLX02 and Herceptin treatment 
groups in both Chinese and non-Chinese populations.

Time to special interest TEAEs showed a similar result pattern within the 2 treatment groups with Chinese 
population resembling the results of Asian and non-Chinese populations matching with results for non-Asian 
population. Cardiac disorders took longest time (16.96 [12.520] weeks in Chinese population and 20.82 
[17.582] weeks in non-Chinese population) to special interest TEAE and injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications (1.49 [5.054] in Chinese population and 1.12 [2.529] weeks in non-Chinese population) reported 
the shortest time in both the populations. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Study HV01 
No deaths occurred and no serious adverse events were reported in either of the two parts of this study. 
Study BC01 
A total of 9 deaths occurred in the study BC01, 3 in the HLX02 group and 6 in the EU-Herceptin group. The 
highest number of deaths (3 patients in Herceptin treatment group) were due to general disorders and 
administration site conditions. One patient (0.3%) each died due to dyspnoea in both treatment groups. Other 
deaths were due to lung infection and pneumonia (1 [0.3%] patient each in HLX02 treatment group), 
cardiovascular disease, electrolyte imbalance, arthralgia and altered consciousness (1 [0.3%] patient each in 
Herceptin treatment group). 
Compared to 8 patients in the Asian population (HLX02: 3 patients; Herceptin: 5 patients) only 1 patient (in 
Herceptin group) died due to a TEAE in the non-Asian population. Most of the deaths (total 4 = 3 in Asian and 1 
non-Asian patient, all in Herceptin group) were due to general disorders and administration site conditions. 
Compared to 8 patients in the Chinese population only 1 patient died due to a TEAE in the non-Chinese 
population. The results observed for Chinese population was same as Asian and non-Chinese was same as the 
non-Asian population.

Laboratory findings 
Study HV01 
In part 1 no clinically significant changes from baseline to post-baseline occurred in any of the dosing groups for 
haematology markers, serum markers of myocardial injury or urinalysis results. 
A total of 8 shifts with clinical significance were noted for abnormal blood bilirubin, ALT, blood triglycerides and 
AST. 
No abnormalities were detected regarding serum markers of myocardial injury, urinalysis, haematology, vital 
signs, physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs and chest X-rays. 
In Part 2 of the study, assessments of most of the haematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis  parameters as 
well as serum markers of myocardial injury were either normal, or abnormal  but not clinically significant and 
none of the abnormalities were reported as SAE. 
No abnormalities were detected regarding vital signs.

Study BC01 
Haematology parameters in both the treatment groups barely shifted from the baseline values and were almost 
same for overall, Asian and non-Asian, Chinese and non-Chinese populations, and no trends could be observed. 
Herceptin patients did however have an overall slightly higher decrease in haematology parameters compared 
to HLX02 subjects. 
Likewise, minimal change was recorded in blood chemistry parameters from baseline and no trend seems to 
exist. 
Coagulation factor analysis and urinalysis did not reveal any untoward changes or differences between 
treatment groups, both from an overall population perspective as in a stratified analysis along the 
Asian/non-Asian/Chinese/non-Chinese axes. 
Generally, changes in vital signs and physical examinations were minimal and did not have any observed trends. 
The shifts  from  baseline to  EOS  showed that  the values  remained  normal  for most  of  the patients. 
With regards to ECG parameters there was no general significant shift from baseline measurements and the 
incidence rate was similar in both treatment groups and similar findings were found in the 
Asian/Chinese/non-Asian/non-Chinese stratified analysis. Abnormal shifts in heart rate did occur in 2 HLX02 
treated patients versus 8 Herceptin treated patients. 
Likewise, no marked shifts in LVEF could be found for the majority of the patient population and treatment group 
differences were neither noted. 
ECOG performance scores remained stable throughout the study (all patients having ECOG PS 0 or 1), with only 
one patient in each treatment group shifting to a PS of 3 by end of study. At safety follow-up 3 HLX02 and 3 
Herceptin patients had shifted to an ECOG PS of 2, while one Herceptin patient presented with a PS of 3. 
Safety in special populations 
No specific safety analysis based on age, sex, height, weight or body mass were provided. Neither were extrinsic 
factors such as medical  environment,  use  of  other  drugs,  use  of  tobacco,  use  of  alcohol,  and  food  habits 
subjected to a safety analysis. 
There was a single pregnancy-related incidence in study HV01 reported as possible pregnancy due to 
unprotected intercourse during the active study period. No further information was provided or available, except 
for the notice that the pregnancy was eventually terminated. 
Immunological events 
In both clinical studies, a multi-tiered strategy was used to detect, confirm and titrate anti-drug ADA. Several 
bioanalytical methods were used for the determination of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) from the serum samples 
of healthy volunteers (study HLX02-HV01) and from patients with HER2 positive, recurrent or previously 
untreated metastatic breast cancer (study HLX02-BC01). In addition, two different approaches were used to 
detect, confirm and titer ADA in the comparative immunogenicity assessment: a one- and a two-assay approach 
for the study HLX02-BC01 and the study HLX02-HV01, respectively. Neutralising antibody (NAb) detection was 
to be performed for all confirmed positive ADA samples. Further discussion on the immunogenicity assays is 
provided in the section 2.6.1. 
Study HLX02-HV01 
No ADA positive results, and subsequently no NAb development, were observed in either part of the study.

Study HLX02-BC01 
The results for the neutralizing capacity of the samples confirmed as ADA positive in study HLX02-BC01 were 
provided at the time of the second interim analysis. ADA positivity was protocol defined as presenting with an 
ADA positive result at any visit post-screening over the course of treatment until 30 days post-last treatment. 
A total of 23 (3.6%) patients (6 [1.9%] in HLX02 and 17 [5.3%] in Herceptin group) tested positive for ADA at 
Screening (prior to first IMP infusion). However, following the protocol definition of ADA positivity in relation to 
study treatment these patients were not considered ADA+ in the immunogenicity analysis.  
During the study a total of 4 patients (0.6%), 2 in each treatment arm, tested ADA positive at one or more 
time-points, and this possibly resulted in a lower mean trastuzumab serum concentration than ADA- patients 
(see Figure 38). In the second interim analysis no new ADA+ cases were identified, though the four subjects that 
were found to be positive were now also confirmed to all have developed neutralizing antibodies.  
Consistent safety results were observed between the 4 ADA positive patients. None of the 4 patients were 
reported with any SAE and 1 patient in Herceptin group experienced IRR. A range of 7 to 24 TEAEs were 
reported. The sample size was too small to draw any conclusion on statistical significance.

Study HLX02-BC01 
Dose reduction was reported in 1 patient in Herceptin treatment group. Dose delay was reported in 55 patients 
in HLX02 treatment group and 46 patients in Herceptin treatment group. Dose interruption was reported in a 
total of 21 and 16 patients from the HLX02 and Herceptin treatment groups, respectively. 
Overall, 59/649 (9.1%) patients experienced a TEAE leading to study drug interruption or withdrawal during the 
active treatment period. There was a similar incidence of patients who had TEAEs leading to study drug 
interruption or withdrawal in the HLX02 and Herceptin treatment groups. The majority of withdrawal events 
occurred due to infusion related reactions. 
A higher number of patients reported drug interruption or drug withdrawn due to a TEAE in the Asian [53 
(10.6%)] and Chinese [51 (10.8%)] populations compared with the non-Asian [6 (4.0%)], and the non-Chinese 
[(8 (4.5%)]) populations.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The current safety analysis is based on data gathered from study HLX02-HV01 and the pivotal HLX02-BC01. 
Study HLX02-HV01 was a Phase II PK and dose-assessment study which recruited only healthy Chinese males 
and consisted of two parts. In part 2, the subjects were 1:1:1 randomized to HLX02/US-Herceptin/EU-Herceptin 
treatment. Study HLX02-BC01 was a Phase III equivalence study comparing HLX02 versus the active 
comparator Herceptin which recruited females only and for which the ethnic make-up was approximately 77% 
Asian/Chinese patients and around 23% Caucasian (EU) patients. 
The cut-off date for the first analysis was the date on which W24 data was available for all patients (23 
November 2018). Overall, 215 patients (116 and 99 in the HLX02 and Herceptin arm, respectively) were still 
under treatment at this data cut-off. Both treatment groups (HLX02 and EU-Herceptin) underwent about the 
same mean number of treatment cycles, but the HLX02 group had a higher mean total exposure (238.4 days 
versus 228.8 days in the Herceptin group) and consequently a higher cumulative dose exposure (median 4550.5 
mg versus 4200.0 mg respectively. This difference was driven by the Caucasian subpopulation where HLX02 
subjects were exposed 9.3 days longer than the Herceptin ones, whereas no such exposure difference was noted 
in the Asian/Chinese subpopulations. In contrast, Asian/Chinese patients had more dose 
interruptions/withdrawals (without apparent difference between treatment groups) compared to Caucasians.  
At the 23 November 2018 cut-off date, about 98.8% of all patients experienced at least one TEAE event, and 
overall the incidence profile was well balanced between the two treatment groups. Nonetheless, most events 
including AESIs, were Grade ≥4 in both groups. ADRs were experienced by approximately 23% of patients in 
both treatment groups. About twice as much EU-Herceptin patients discontinued study participation (2.2% 
versus 1.2% in the HLX02 group), despite the number of TESAEs and SADRs being similar in both arms. 
Generally, the types of reported TESAEs were fairly evenly distributed between both treatment groups, with 
neutrophil count decreased (10.2% of HLX02 patients; 7.4% of Herceptin patients), WBC decreased (4.9% and 
3.7% respectively), and febrile neutropenia (3.4% in both groups) being the most reported events. 
A total of 5261 AESIs were reported by 248 HLX02 subjects and 232 EU-Herceptin subjects, with a broadly 
similar incidence and event profile between the two groups. The most reported events in both groups were 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020

neutrophil/WBC decrease and anaemia. When stratified along severity grades it was shown that HLX02 patients 
had more grade 4 AESIs compared to the EU-Herceptin subjects. 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) leading to death occurred in both groups, with twice as many 
incidents in the EU-Herceptin group (6 fatalities versus 3 in the HLX02 group), but the overall very low number 
of deaths precludes any confirmative analysis on this observation.  
As advised during in the CHMP Scientific Advice, the Applicant also investigated all the safety parameters in a 
stratified analysis, with the stratification axes being Asian/non-Asian and Chinese/non-Chinese. This gave rise 
to three sub-populations: Chinese (73%), non-Chinese Asian (4%) and Caucasian subjects (23%). The 
stratified analysis led to the observation that the Asian population (including Chinese and non-Chinese Asian 
subjects) had a far greater incidence of AESIs and SAEs compared to the Caucasian subjects, with the same 
observation apparent in the Chinese versus non-Chinese subjects and Asian versus non-Asian stratification 
analyses.  
ADRs and severity graded TEAEs were balanced between the treatment arms in the 
non-Asian/Asian/non-Chinese/Chinese stratified analyses, although when compared in a stratified manner it 
seems that the Asian population had a higher incidence of treatment related anaemia. 
Given that sensitivity to anaemia is intricately linked with body weight, an analysis of the safety parameters 
stratified according to body weight was requested to check whether this may possibly be the underlying reason 
for the Asian/Chinese/Other ethnicities discordances noted above. Patients with a weight up to 60 kg were found 
to be generally more predisposed towards anaemia-related adverse events. The analysis was hampered by the 
fact that relatively few non-Asians fell in a weight category below 60 kg. Nonetheless, the results indicate that 
Asians with a body weight comparable to the relatively heavier non-Asian subjects did not differ in anaemia and 
anaemia-related adverse event frequencies, whereas patients with lower body weights were more affected. 
Proportionally more subjects in the Asian/Chinese subgroups reported TESAEs (28%) than in the non-Asian 
subgroup (6%), with the most common events being neutrophil count decreased and WBC decreased in all 
subgroups, while the Asian subjects also had a relatively high incidence of febrile neutropenia. 
In regards to drug-related TESAEs (TESADRs), there was an overall balance in incidence and types of events 
between the HLX-02 and EU-Herceptin groups overall, but when stratified according to subpopulations it was 
clear that the pattern of higher incidence in Asian subjects, as noticed for overall TESAEs, was also apparent for 
TESADRs. 
Drug interruptions or withdrawals happened in 7% of patients overall with no appreciable difference between 
the two treatment groups. However, non-Chinese Asian/Chinese subjects had a 3- and 2.5-fold higher rate of 
drug interruptions and withdrawals based on the performed analyses. 
As a minimum of 1 year of median treatment exposure is considered necessary to allow a sufficiently rigorous 
safety evaluation, the applicant provided the results from a second interim analysis with the cut-off date 10 July 
2019. It is noted that the median exposure duration with this second interim analysis did not reach the 
requested one year of duration (median duration of 312 days). Nonetheless, based on the safety and 
immunogenicity data available in the second interim analysis which did not show worrisome divergences 
between treatment groups, this is considered acceptable. Also, it is unlikely that the 1.8-month difference in 
exposure would expose a divergence between treatment groups in either safety or immunogenic aspects. 
Furthermore, the applicant will provide the final safety analysis together with the final CSR. However, it is clear 
that the threshold of 1 year of exposure data will not be met due to the large number of patients that have 
already exited the study at the second interim analysis.

In the second interim report, the numbers of exposed patients and the demographic characteristics remained 
the same as in the first interim analysis. A total of 292 (45.0%) patients had completed the 12-month study 
treatment (47.8% in the HLX02 treatment group and 42.2% in the Herceptin treatment group). In the overall 
population, the difference in median cumulative dose exposure between the HLX02 and the Herceptin arms 
remained visible despite relatively equal treatment cycle numbers: 5488.5 mg for HLX02 and 4945.0 mg for 
Herceptin. Although the exposure duration difference between different treatment groups has further increased, 
this has not resulted in an appreciable effect on the safety profile comparison. 
Generally, the overall adverse event profile remained unchanged, with a small number of TEAEs being 
reclassified from ‘unrelated’ to ‘related’ without any impact on the overall similarity of safety profiles between 
HLX02 and Herceptin. No new deaths were reported in either treatment group. 
Renal and urinary disorders have now also been observed, but overall the treatment groups are balanced in 
regard to frequency and severity. The vast majority of events in this SOC were mild in nature and no Grade 4 
events occurred.  
With regards to AESIs, HLX02 subjects experienced an about ten percent higher incidence of grade 4 severity 
adverse events of special interest in the first analysis and a difference in Grade 4 severity AESI still exists in the 
second interim analysis (6%). However, the fact that longer term data led to a decrease of the gap between 
treatment groups indicates that this may have been caused by immature data. The difference is considered too 
small to ascribe cause to the observations. 
Slightly higher incidence of AEs of special interest were reported with HLX02 for investigations, especially for 
white blood cell decreased, neutrophil count decreased and infusion related reactions (12.0% for HLX02 vs 8.3% 
for Herceptin, DCO 28 November 2018). Results from the second interim analysis were in line with those 
observed in the first interim analysis. Overall, even if incidence is slightly higher for HLX02, differences are small 
enough to be considered a chance finding.  
Imbalance in the SOC of cardiac disorders (7.7% in the HLX02 arm and 13.2% in the Herceptin arm) was 
requested to be discussed. Neither cardiac events nor overall LVEF had large changes or discrepancies noted 
throughout both interim analyses, and moreover no clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups 
are apparent at this timepoint. Based on the data provided HLX02 does not appear to induce untoward more 
cardiac abnormalities during the treatment duration as achieved in the pivotal trial. 
Although being more a question about the overall safety profile rather than differences between HLX02 and 
Herceptin groups, the higher rate of dose interruptions in Asian version Non-Asian remained noticeable at the 
second interim analysis: 18 in the Asian HLX02 and 16 in the Asian Herceptin groups versus 3 and 0 in non-Asian 
subjects respectively. 
Numerically more Asian patients had discontinuations due to AEs in both arms, although the numbers were low: 
6 patients (2.4%) in the HLX02 arm and 8 patients (3.2%) in the Herceptin arm in Asian patients and 
respectively, 3 patients (3.9%) and 0 patients in the non-Asian subpopulation. 
Differences in the incidence of treatment-related anaemia between Asian and non-Asian subjects were also 
present. Notably, between Asian and non-Asian stratified groups a large gap remained in the proportion of AESIs 
(95.8% vs 26.7%), both with HLX02 and Herceptin. 
Although it is true that in the pivotal phase III trial, proportionally, more than three times as much subjects were 
Asian versus Non-Asian (N = 499 versus 150 respectively), the differences in safety outcomes seen are too large 
to be explainable by sheer numerical skewing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 143/153 
 
  
  
 
Although it is acknowledged that different populations exhibit different sensitivities and safety to different 
anti-tumour therapies and that other factors may also influence outcomes, the differences seen are of such 
magnitude that it makes it unlikely that extrinsic factors could be the cause, leaving the possibility that an 
ethnogenetic difference in response to the treatment could be a reasonable cause for the observed differences 
in safety. It can be argued that possibly docetaxel may be the culpable factor at play here, and that Asian 
populations may be more sensitive to haematological/neutropenic toxicities for this compound (Yano 2013, 
Kenmotsu 2015). Chemotherapies tend to have more haematotoxic impact on Asian patients, which may be in 
part due to the general lower body weight of these people. 
It is indeed acknowledged that docetaxel is known to be able to cause haematological adverse events such as 
neutropenia and leukopenia, but on the other hand so does trastuzumab (febrile neutropenia, anaemia, 
neutropenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are all listed as very common side effects in the Herceptin 
SmPC). What is also clear however is that in the trastuzumab monotherapy HLX02-HV01 study, encompassing 
123 subjects over both study phases, haematologic disorders were very rare (affecting only around 2% of 
subjects). This finding in combination with the published data referred above does led some credence to the 
argument that it may indeed be the docetaxel component of the pivotal trial treatment which is causing the large 
difference in certain adverse events between the Asian and non-Asian study populations. Differential prior 
exposure to chemotherapy might also explain the observed differences in safety profile. 
In study HV01, only Chinese subjects were enrolled which was discussed in the CHMP Scientific Advice in which 
it was noted that no ethnogenetic effects on outcomes would reasonably be expected but that a stratified 
analysis in the Phase III trial was considered prudent for certainty’s sake. However, this approach would also 
imply that if said stratified analysis would find indication of clinically relevant differences between 
Chinese/non-Chinese subjects in regards to outcomes, the acceptability of the Phase II study in regards to dose 
definition, safety guidance and PK towards non-Chinese subjects could become a point of scrutiny. However, the 
observed differences in safety profile between Asian and non-Asian populations were thoroughly discussed, and 
adequately supported with possible clarifications, such that the acceptability of the phase II study in support of 
the application could be reasonably accepted. 
In study part I, there was generally even balance between the incidence of TEAEs and ADRs between the three 
treatment groups, and no untoward adverse event findings were apparent in the different dose groups. In 
neither of the study parts SAEs or deaths were noted and the majority of events were mild to moderate in 
intensity. 
In part 2 the most reported TEAEs were in the SOCs investigations, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders 
and administration site conditions and (only in the US-Herceptin group) cardiac disorders. In terms of Preferred 
Term TEAEs that occurred in more than 5 % of patients, these were noted as being ALT increased, Blood 
triglycerides increased, AST increased, Neutrophil count increased, WBC count increased, N-terminal 
prohormone brain natriuretic peptide increased, GGT increased, WBC urine positive, Blood bilirubin increased, 
Blood glucose increased, and Glucose urine present. 
On further analysis it seems that more incidents of neutrophil count increased and WBC count increased 
occurred in the HLX02 patients compared to both Herceptin groups (differences noted between 10 and 20%) 
whereas the US Herceptin patients had more incidences of liver injury markers (differences of up to 10%). As 
the neutrophil and WBC count increased events were usually evaluated as ADR this also implied that in 
combination with the ECG T-Wave observations more ADRs were noted in the HLX02 and US-Herceptin patients.

EMA/327248/2020

Given that no severity analyses were undertaken, it is difficult to ascribe clinical relevancy to these findings. 
However, considering that these observations were not replicated in the larger Phase III HLX02-BC01 trial, it is 
likely that these observations are chance findings. 
With regards to immunogenicity, a two-antigen assay approach with one assay using reagents that detect ADA 
against the biosimilar product HLX02 and one assay using reagents that detect ADA against the reference 
product was used in the study HLX02-HV01. With the exception of the binding reagents (biotinylated-drug and 
ruthenylated-drug), the same electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bridging format with a prior ELISA extraction 
phase using the respective drug was performed (HLX02 or CN-Herceptin manufactured in US). The suitability of 
using US Herceptin-labeled reagents to detect antibodies against both EU Herceptin and US Herceptin was 
investigated in a number of experiments. Overall, a number of limitations have been identified for the 
immunogenicity assays used in the study HLX02-HV01. Because the comparative immunogenicity exercise 
between the originator and the biosimilar is largely made by the analysis of ADA data generated from study 
HLX02-BC01, these issues are not further pursued. 
In the study HLX02-BC01, a single-antigen approach using biotinylated- and ruthenylated-HLX02 in an another 
ECL bridging assay has been applied to detect, confirm and titer ADA. The 24 months long-term stability data for 
the ADA samples tested with this method are recommended to be provided (recommendation).  
A neutralising assay based on a direct competitive ligand binding approach using HLX02 as binding and detection 
reagent and including an acid dissociation step has been developed and validated. Although some parameters 
were not selected as recommended in the current state-of the-art-practices, it is expected that it would not 
change the comparative immunogenicity assessment considering the clinical data and the low risk of 
immunogenicity for trastuzumab products in the intended treatment populations. 
Since no ADA were detected in the study HLX02-HV01, no NAb analysis was carried out and no validation 
activities for the associated analytical method were completed. In clinical study HLX02-BC01, a number of 
patients were found ADA positive (see below). Neutralising antibody (NAb) detection was to be performed for all 
confirmed positive ADA samples. The final bioanalytical reports (ADA and NAb assays) are recommended to be 
provided (see recommendation). 
It is noted that all 4 ADA+ patients were also NAb+, with an observed impact on serum availability of the study 
treatments. No immediate effect was noted on the safety parameters, while in regards to efficacy two of the four 
patients were found to suffer progressive disease and two had stable disease at the end of treatment. The 
available data does not seem to indicate that a difference between originator and biosimilar in this regard exists, 
but on the other hand the numbers observed are too low to allow drawing any statistically meaningful conclusion 
from these observations. Given that no more patients are currently undergoing treatment it is expected that 
finalised immunogenicity data will be forthcoming in the final report (recommendation), though given the 
paucity of nAB+ subjects new insights are not expected.  
Furthermore, in the HLX02-BC01 trial 23 subjects were tested positive for ADA at screening, presumably due to 
trastuzumab exposure >12 months prior if adherent to the inclusion criteria, and a further four shifted from 
ADA-negative to ADA–positive status during the trial. Only these latter 4 were considered as ADA-positive 
subjects for the immunogenicity analysis. However, it was considered necessary to also analyse the response of 
the ADA+-at-screening subjects in order to form a more complete image of the immunogenic profile of HLX02 
versus Herceptin. This analysis was provided in response and generally no effect on safety could be detected. 
Likewise, the ADA+-at-screening patients did not seem to have an ORR that diverged from the overall ORR 
findings (data not shown). However, it is difficult to draw any solid conclusion on these observations given the 
extremely low sample size.  
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 145/153 
 
  
  
 
Overall, there were some hints that ADA positivity may influence response but the number of subjects with ADA 
and/or NAb positive were too limited to be able to draw any conclusion. 
Medication errors due to subcutaneous administration have been classified as important identified risk in the 
RMP for this biosimilar based on its seriousness, but the benefit risk defined in the SmPC is not impacted. 
Whereas Zercepac is presented as a lyophilised formulation for intravenous infusion, the reference medicinal 
Herceptin is available in two presentations for both intravenous and subcutaneous administration. It is therefore 
possible that a mistake could be made and Zercepac could be administered subcutaneously which could lead to 
patient harm through over dosing, under dosing or treatment toxicity. However, the risk is greater with the 
reference medicinal product Herceptin, than for trastuzumab biosimilars which have been approved with a single 
route of administration. Herceptin has now been used for several years as standard practice with successful risk 
strategies. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall the safety of HLX02 does not seem to deviate from the safety profile of the Herceptin comparator. Some 
differences in certain safety parameters were observed in the analysis conducted with Asian/non-Asian and 
Chinese/non-Chinese the Asian/Chinese/non-Asian/non-Chinese as stratification axes. However, this could be 
due to the difference in docetaxel toxicity which exists between Asian and non-Asian patients. Furthermore, 
ADRs and severity graded TEAEs were balanced between the treatment arms in these subpopulations.  
Despite the shortfall of one month of exposure, the totality of evidence generated at this point sufficiently 
indicates that the investigational medicinal product, HLX02 is biosimilar to the reference product from a safety 
perspective. Updated safety data, including immunogenicity data, are recommended to be provided with the 
final CSR of study HLX02-BC01.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
HLX02 (Zercepac) has been developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Herceptin (INN: trastuzumab) for 
intravenous use. Subcutaneous use is not applied for. The proposed indications for HLX02 are the same as those 
currently authorised for the reference medicinal product:  
•  Treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC),  
•  Treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC),  
•  Treatment in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin of adult patients with 
HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction who have not 
received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease.  
To assess the biosimilarity of HLX02 to the reference medicinal product Herceptin from a quality perspective, the 
applicant has performed an extensive head-to-head analytical study and an overall similarity study using 
multiple batches of HLX02 and Herceptin. An array of orthogonal analytical methods has been used to assess the 
primary and high order structure, the purity and impurity profile of the molecule, the extent of post translational 
modifications and the biological activity of the molecule. 
For the in vitro non-clinical biosimilarity assessment several assays were conducted, including the binding 
kinetics of HLX02 to HER2, inhibition of the proliferation, ADCC, ADCP, CDC, apoptosis, C1q binding and FcγR 
and FcRn-receptor affinity assays. In all the studies performed, HLX02 was manufactured according to two 
manufacturing processes and comparisons were conducted against several batches of EU-sourced Herceptin. In 
vivo studies including pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology determinations were carried out with 
HLX02 following a prior manufacturing process and compared to China-sourced Herceptin. Data provided is 
compliant with applicable EMA guidance although in vivo studies are not considered essential for MAA according 
to current relevant EMA guidelines. The in vitro primary pharmacodynamics data provided concluded on 
biosimilarity between HLX02 and the reference medicinal product trastuzumab (Herceptin). 
The clinical development programme to demonstrate PK comparability and clinical efficacy/safety similarity 
between HLX02 and reference medicinal product trastuzumab (Herceptin), consisted of two trials: 
PK similarity: Phase 1, two-parts [Part 1 – open-label, single dose-ascending study evaluating safety, 
tolerability, immunogenicity and PK at different doses of HLX02; Part 2 - randomised, double-blind, 3-arm 
parallel-controlled, single-dose study comparing the PK, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity comparability 
of HLX02 and two reference medicinal product trastuzumab (EU-sourced Herceptin manufactured in Germany 
and CN-sourced Herceptin manufactured in the US)) clinical trial in healthy male subjects (Study HLX02-HV01). 
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 149/153 
 
  
  
 
Clinical efficacy and safety comparability: Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, 2-arm parallel-controlled, 
multi-national confirmatory study evaluating the efficacy and safety of HLX02 versus EU-sourced Herceptin in 
patients with HER2-overexpressing recurrent or previously-untreated metastatic breast cancer (Study 
HLX02-BC01). 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
From a quality perspective, the available data from the analytical similarity assessment demonstrates that 
HLX02 is highly similar to Herceptin. The amino acid sequence is identical, and primary and higher order 
structures including secondary, tertiary structure are similar. The purity and heterogeneities between HLX02 
and Herceptin assessed by SEC, CE-SDS, CEX, icIEF and UPLC-FLR glycan profiling are highly similar, with 
similar profiles of size and charge variants and glycan moieties. Minor differences in relative abundance of 
charge variants and glycan moieties were observed and have been appropriately justified. A series of functional 
assays relevant to MoA, efficacy and safety were conducted to evaluate the biological activity. In response to a 
major objection raised, satisfactory data was provided to confirm high similarity between HLX02 and EU 
Herceptin with regard to ADCC activity. The forced degradation studies involving high temperature, illumination, 
acidity, alkalinity, oxidation and shaking showed that HLX02 and Herceptin-EU had similar degradation 
behaviours and degradation trends.  
The data provided regarding the in vitro primary pharmacodynamics studies support similarity between 
Herceptin and HLX02 (Zercepac) from a non-clinical perspective. 
By the cut-off date (27 November 2018), the pivotal trial met the primary endpoint at the interim analysis. The 
difference in ORR (HLX02 minus Herceptin) between the 2 treatments was -0.4 % with 95%CI of -7.4 % to 
6.6%. The 95% CI was within the pre-specified equivalence margin of -13.5% to 13.5%. The ORR up to 24 
weeks in ITT set was 71.0% (230 of 324 patients) (95% CI, 66.0, 75.9) for HLX02 and 71.4% (232 of 325 
patients) (95% CI, 66.5, 76.3) for Herceptin.  
The results from primary analysis were supported by the results of several sensitivity analyses. With the second 
interim analyses (10 Jul 2019), a trend in favour of HLX02 was observed in the primary endpoint and ORR at 
week 33, 42 assessed by the investigators. However, no significant difference was found between two treatment 
groups in terms of median DoR, PFS and OS in the second interim analysis despite of the immature data, which 
partly supported the primary results. 
In the pivotal study Study HLX02-BC01, the safety of HLX02 did not seem to deviate from the safety profile of 
the Herceptin comparator. Some differences in certain safety parameters were observed in the analysis 
conducted with Asian/non-Asian and Chinese/non-Chinese the Asian/Chinese/non-Asian/non-Chinese as 
stratification axes. However, this could be due to the difference in docetaxel toxicity which exists between Asian 
and non-Asian patients. Furthermore, ADRs and severity graded TEAEs were balanced between the treatment 
arms in these subpopulations.  
With regards to immunogenicity, the number of subjects with ADA and/or NAb positive results were too limited 
to be able to draw any clinically meaningful conclusion. 
Overall, biosimilarity of HLX02 to the reference medicinal products can be concluded from a PK/PD, 
immunogenicity, safety and efficacy perspective.  
Assessment report  
EMA/327248/2020 
Page 150/153 
 
  
  
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
The median exposure duration with the second interim analysis did not reach the requested one year of duration 
(median duration of 312 days). Nonetheless, based on the safety and immunogenicity data available in the 
second interim analysis which did not show worrisome divergences between treatment groups, this is 
considered acceptable. Also, it is unlikely that the 1.8-month difference in exposure would expose a divergence 
between treatment groups in either safety or immunogenic aspects. Furthermore, the applicant is 
recommended to provide updated safety analysis, including immunogenicity data, in the final CSR. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
From a quality perspective, an extensive comparability exercise has been performed between HLX02 and EU 
Herceptin and the results confirm a high level of similarity from a quality point of view. 
Biosimilarity of HLX02 to the reference medicinal product Herceptin is supported from a non-clinical perspective 
based on the in vitro pharmacology data. 
From a PK/PD, efficacy and safety perspective, biosimilarity of HLX02 to the reference medicinal products can be 
concluded.  Despite the shortfall of one month of exposure, the totality of evidence generated at this point 
sufficiently indicates that the investigational medicinal product, HLX02 is biosimilar to the reference product 
from a safety perspective. 
Therefore, based on the totality of data, biosimilarity between HLX02 and Herceptin has been demonstrated. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Extrapolation of indication has been justified by the applicant based on the fact that the mechanism of action of 
trastuzumab is the same in all three indications and the target receptor involved is also the same in MBC, EBC 
and MGC. The dosage is also similar for all three indications, and trastuzumab is administered by the same route 
in all indications. Hence, extrapolation in terms of efficacy is supported by the results of the physicochemical, 
structural and biological characterisation data, results from the comparative preclinical studies (in vitro 
functional tests) together with PK comparability data. Extrapolation is also considered acceptable from a safety 
perspective. 
3.6.  Additional considerations 
It has also to be considered that medication errors (subcutaneous administration) have been included as 
identified risk, due to the marketed formulation from the reference medicinal product. In this regard, measures 
are in place to mitigate this risk (routine risk communication as well as routine risk minimisation activities), 
which are sufficient in order to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Zercepac is considered biosimilar to Herceptin. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Zercepac is favourable in the following indication: 
“Breast cancer 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Zercepac is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline 
and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients 
must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. 
in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for 
their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. 
in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy 
for their metastatic disease. 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with 
hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
Early breast cancer 
Zercepac is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see 
section 5.1). 
following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with paclitaxel 
or docetaxel. 
in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Zercepac therapy, for locally 
advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Zercepac should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have either 
HER2  overexpression  or  HER2  gene  amplification  as  determined  by  an  accurate  and  validated  assay  (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
Zercepac in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction who 
have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. 
Zercepac should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have HER2 
overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ result. Accurate 
and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).”

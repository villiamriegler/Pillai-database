Introduction 
Anakinra  is  a  competitive  antagonist  (without  agonist  activity)  at  Interleukin  1  (IL-1)  cell  surface 
receptors.  Thus  anakinra  inhibits  the  biological  activity  of  Interleukin  1α  and  1β  (IL-1αand  IL-1β), 
which are considered critical mediators of inflammation and joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis.  
The  indication  is  “Kineret  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  rheumatoid 
arthritis  in  combination  with  methotrexate,  in  patients  with  an  inadequate  response  to  methotrexate 
alone.”

Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
Kineret  is  a  ready  to  use  aqueous  formulation  of  anakinra  provided  in  a  pre-filled  syringe  and  vial 
containing  100  mg  of  active  substance  (0.67  ml  deliverable/extractable  volume  respectively).   
The  formulation  contains  citrate,  sodium  chloride,  EDTA,  polysorbate  80,  water  for  injections  and 
sodium hydroxide.  The  pH, excipients and their concentrations were selected to  minimise chemical 
degradation  during  storage.  When  choosing  excipients  consideration  was  also  given  to  choice  of 
pharmacopoeial substances, frequency of pharmaceutical use, and minimisation of patient discomfort.  
Active substance 
Anakinra,  the  active  substance,  is  a  recombinant  form  of  human  interleukin-1  receptor  antagonist  
(r-metHu IL-1ra) produced in E. coli. It has the amino acid sequence of the naturally occurring form of 
the protein with the addition of an N-terminal  methionine residue, required for production in E coli.   
It is a 153 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 17.3 kDa. 
The  applicant  provided  descriptions  of  the  expression  vector,  encoding  gene  construct  used  for 
generation  of  the  cell  line,  and  preparation  of  the  master  cell  bank  (MCB).    Details  of  the  tests 
conducted  on  the  MCB  have  been  provided.    A  working  cell  bank  will  be  introduced  post 
authorisation. 
Fermentation 
Anakinra is produced by a fermentation process that is comprised of cell expansion of the master cell 
bank, inoculation of the fermentor, cell growth in the fermentor, induction of product, and cell harvest. 
Afterwards, the cells are lysed, and the lysate is collected for further processing. 
Purification 
Purification of anakinra is accomplished by a sequence of chromatographic and filtration steps for the 
generation  of  filtered  purified  bulk  product.  In-process  controls  and  specifications  are  adequate  to 
control product quality and consistency of the purification process. In-process acceptance limits have 
been set for critical purification parameters.  The company has provided information on the removal of 
host cell derived impurities, process- and product-related impurities.  The active substance is produced 
by Amgen Inc., USA.  The fermentation and purification processes have been validated. 
Characterisation 
Anakinra has been characterised using physico-chemical and biological assays. Anakinra is adequately 
controlled  by  a  combination  of  physico-chemical,  biological  and 
immunological  methods.  
Appropriate specifications have been set for analysis of the active substance at release and at the end 
of the shelf life. Methods used for release testing have been described and validated.  Batch analysis 
data demonstrate a consistent production of the active substance.

All  excipients  used  comply  with  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  requirements.  For  polysorbate  80,  
the  only  material  of  ruminant  origin,  sufficient  information  has  been  provided  to  demonstrate 
compliance with the TSE guideline. The company has undertaken to implement the use of polysorbate 
of vegetable origin. 
The 3 ml vial container closure system consists of a borosilicate Type 1 glass with rubber stopper and 
aluminium seal and polymer flip off cap. The 1 ml syringes are made of borosilicate Type I glass with 
staked needle.  All components meet Ph Eur requirements. 
Product development and finished product 
The  manufacturing  process  for  the  final  product  consists  of  a  dilution  of  the  filtered  purified  bulk 
(active  substance)  to  the  desired  concentration  with  buffer,  followed  by  sterile  filtration  and  sterile 
filling  into  vials  or  syringes.  Production  of  the  Finished  Product  is  carried  out  at  Amgen 
Manufacturing Limited, Puerto Rico. Packaging, labelling, and final release is performed by Amgen 
Europe B.V., Breda, The Netherlands. 
The  manufacturing  process  for  the  final  product  has  been  validated  and  is  controlled  by  in-process 
controls and product release specifications. The quality of the final product is ensured by analyses of 
the product by a combination of physico-chemical, biological, and immunological methods. Methods 
used for specification testing have been described and validated. 
Stability of the Product   
Based  on  real-time  stability  results  after  storage  at  2-8°C,  a  shelf  life  as  described  in  the  product 
information is acceptable for both pharmaceutical forms (vials and syringes).

Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
No  formal  pharmacodynamic  studies  relating  to  proposed  indications  have  been  performed  by  the 
applicant. However published literature have been listed and provided. The cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β 
are considered to be critical mediators of inflammation and joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis, and 
through its antagonist function, anakinra inhibits the action of these IL-1 cytokines. In different animal 
models  of  arthritis,  systemic  administration  of  anakinra  attenuated  the  inflammatory  response,  bone 
destruction and cartilage degeneration. 
General and safety pharmacology programme  
• 
The effects of anakinra (IL-1ra) were assessed in a series of safety pharmacology studies in mice, rats, 
dogs  and  on  guinea  pig  ileum.  In  mice  and  rats,  no  anakinra  related  effects  were  seen  in  tests  for 
central/autonomic,  analgesic  activity,  anti-inflammatory  activity,  cardiovascular,  digestive  or  renal 
functions. In guinea pig ileum, there was no influence of anakinra on autonomic nervous system and 
smooth  muscle.  No  anakinra  related  effects  relating  to  blood  pressure,  heart  rate,  respiration,  blood 
flow or ECG were observed. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions  
• 
Anakinra  acts  at  different  receptors  to  both  NSAIDs  and  corticosteroids,  and  an  interaction  at  the 
receptor systems is therefore not anticipated.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics studies were conducted in rats, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. 
SC  injection  resulted  in  prolongation  of  measurable  plasma  levels  compared  to  IV  injection  in  each 
animal  species.  T½  values  were  however  comparable  for  IV  and  SC  administration.  Bioavailability 
after SC dosing was 62, 72 and 88%, respectively, in rat, rabbit and cynomolgus monkey. The mean 
terminal  half-life  values  were  0.89,  1.18  and  3.30  hours  for  rat,  rabbit  and  cynomolgus  monkey.  
Results from a rat study demonstrated that the kidney was responsible for approximately 80% of the 
anakinra plasma clearance.  Allometric scaling of animal data predicted anakinra plasma clearance in 
humans reasonably well.  
In the rat, a marked accumulation of plasma anakinra concentration of up to 48 times the day 1 values 
was observed after SC administration for 14 days. The decrease in the systemic clearance of anakinra 
after  multiple  doses  could  be  attributed  to  decreases  in  renal  glomerular  filtration  due  to  binding  of 
2/21 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anakinra to anti-anakinra antibody or other proteins.  In the rhesus monkey, there was no accumulation 
after daily doses of 100 or 200 mg/kg/day SC for 28 days, whereas there was 74% accumulation after 
doses of 10 mg/kg/day for the same period. 
Since the passive transfer of all drugs with a MW over 1 kd across the human placenta are impeded, 
the placental passive transfer of a anakinra with MW 17 kd would be minimal. Moreover, anakinra is 
water-soluble, decreasing the probability of passive transfer. 
Concerning  active  transfer,  IL-1ra  is  naturally  present  in  amniotic  fluid,  maintaining  placental 
homeostasis,  and  possibly  protecting  against  IL-1β-induced  pre-term  parturition.  Foetuses  will  be 
exposed to IL-1ra by swallowing and respiring amniotic fluid. Infants are also naturally exposed to IL-
1ra through breast milk. 
Safety  margins  were  calculated  by  comparing  Cmax  and  AUC  values  from  rat  and  human  studies. 
Safety margins ranged from 42 to 190 based on the Cmax   ratio and from 29 to 91 based on the AUC 
ratio. 
Distribution studies showed that steady-state tissue-to-plasma anakinra concentration ratios in  the rat 
were consistent with distribution into the physiologic extracellular fluid volume for all tissues except 
for  the  kidney;  the  kidney  had  a  ratio  much  larger  than  the  extrcellular  volume  of  the  kidney, 
indicating that the kidney is the major organ to eliminate anakinra from the circulation. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
• 
Pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  interaction  studies  were  done  with  the  anti-rheumatic  drugs 
methotrexate and PEG-sTNF-RI (a PEGylated inhibitor of the TNF receptor). Anakinra given SC to 
rats up to 100 mg/kg/day for 28 days and methotrexate given orally up to 0.2 mg/kg/day in the same 
period did not change the kinetics of either drug. However, Cmax and AUC of anakinra increased over 
time  to  the  same  extent  as  when  anakinra  was  given  without  methotrexate  co-administration.  
In  another  interaction  study,  rats  received  anakinra  IV  and  PEG  sTNF-RI  SC.  There  were  no 
significant  differences  in  anakinra  pharmacokinetics  when  anakinra  was  coadministered  with  PEG-
sTNF-RI. Similarly, no alterations of anakinra pharmacokinetics after SC administration in monkeys 
was seen with concomitant PEG sTNF-R1 SC administration. 
As reported in the literature, both IL-1α and IL-1β have been shown to down-regulate the expression 
and  activity  of  cytochrome  P450  monooxygenases  in  in  vitro  assay  systems.  Since  anakinra  blocks 
receptor association of IL-1 α and IL-1β, this could result in the inhibition of down-regulation of CYP 
by these cytokines. However definitive evidence is lacking regarding the in vivo modulation of CYP 
in humans with RA. 
Interactions with NSAIDs or corticosteroids can occur prior to or during absorption, via alteration of a 
metabolism or excretion mechanism, or by effects at the site of action. No alteration in absorption is 
expected,  as  anakinra  is  not  given  orally.  Anakinra  is  not  metabolised  by  the  liver  via  phase  1  or  
2 mechanisms and is not known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore the applicant argues 
that there is no reason to anticipate altered metabolism of NSAIDs or corticosteroids. It is also argued 
that  no  alteration  of  elimination  should  be  expected,  as  the  mechanisms  involved  in  elimination  are 
thought not to be the same for anakinra as that for NSAIDs and corticosteroids; however no data were 
provided. 
Toxicology 
The activity of human IL-1β and of anakinra in rhesus and cynomolgus monkey blood as well as in 
human  blood  was  shown.  Human  IL-1β  induced  production  of  IL-6  in  both  monkey  species,  and 
concentrations required for a 50% response were similar. Anakinra inhibited the IL-1β response in all 
three  species  with  similar  efficacy.  The  experiments  confirmed  that  the  pharmacological  activity  of 
anakinra in monkey whole blood is comparable to its activity in human whole blood. Based on these 
arguments, it is claimed that the monkey can be considered to be a valid species for the assessment of 
human safety.

• 
Single dose toxicity 
A single dose toxicity study of anakinra was conducted in rats. There were no pharmacotoxic signs, 
body weight changes, macroscopic or microscopic observations that were attributed to the test article 
at IV doses up to 720 mg/kg. Anakinra was administered IV to cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 
150  mg/kg  given  in  an  escalating  fashion  with  a  48-hour  observation  interval  between  doses.  
There were no test article-related pharmacotoxic signs observed during the study period, and physical 
examination  revealed  no  abnormal  signs.  Although  SC  is  the  intended  route  of  administration  of 
anakinra, the IV data support the absence of systemic toxicity, at doses and exposure levels that are 
higher than those that could be achieved through SC administration. 
It was concluded that anakinra lacks acute toxic effects even in very high doses. 
• 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Rats 
Four  2-week  IV  toxicity  tests  were  conducted  in  rats  at  doses  up  to  30  mg/kg/day.  No  systemic 
toxicity was observed in these studies. Histopathologic and clinical findings showed that test article at 
30 mg/kg/day induced a reversible perivascular inflammation within intravenous injection sites.  
Anakinra was given SC to rats at up to 120 mg/kg/day, for up to 14 days. No treatment-related toxicity 
was  noted.  Chronic  inflammation  was  observed  only  in  the  test  article-treated  rats.  The  NOEL  for 
systemic toxicity was considered to  be 120  mg/kg/day after 14  days treatment. The NOEL  for local 
inflammatory reactions was 80 mg/kg/day in the rat. 
In  a  6-month  toxicity  study  in  rats,  SC  treatment  produced  local  injection  site  inflammation  at  all 
dosages. At 200 mg/kg/day, there was an increase in the weight of the kidneys in male rats and of the 
liver  in  both  genders.  The  increased  liver  weight  was  claimed  not  to  be  associated  with  any 
histopathological (gross or microscopic liver lesions) or liver enzyme changes.  
At 200 mg/kg/day, systemic toxicity was noted for the kidney after 6 months of dosing. Proteinuria, 
renal  interstitial  mononuclear  cell  infiltration  and  chronic  progressive  nephropathy  were  observed. 
There  were  no  observed  treatment-related  changes  in  haematology  or  clinical  chemistry  during  the 
study.  Using  the  Dunnett  test,  statistical  evaluation  of  CPN  incidence  showed  that  there  was  no 
significant  difference  in  incidence  of  CPN  in  the  treated  vs.  control  animals  (p ≥ 0.05).    There  was 
however a trend towards increased CPN with dose in male rats. 
Two long-term extension studies are ongoing to evaluate the safety of anakinra in over 1300 anakinra 
treated  subjects.    In  both  of  these  studies,  serum  chemistry  and  urinalysis  are  being  conducted  on  a 
regular basis during the 3 year study duration.  This should provide information on potential long-term 
toxicity. 
Concerning safety concerns on the likelihood of renal toxicity in renal insufficiency: The exclusion of 
severely  renally  impaired  patients  from  treatment  with  anakinra  would  assure  additional  mitigation.  
Such  a  recommendation  has  been  made  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  where,  in  the 
absence  of  clinical  data  in  this  patient  population,  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  
(CLcr < 30 ml/minute) are contraindicated. 
It is suggested that drug accumulation seen preclinically after daily treatment for one month or more is 
not  related  to  nephrotoxic  effects  but  is  due  to  immune  complexes.  It  has  been  reported  by  the 
applicant  that  immune  complexes  were  observed  in  12  out  of  12  tested  rat  samples,  supporting  the 
hypothesis that plasma accumulation of anakinra in rats was due to immune complex formation. 
Monkeys 
In a 2-week SC test in rhesus monkeys, the incidence of slight inflammation at the injection site was 
higher in the high dose group and was attributed to the test article. Antibody to anakinra was detected 
in almost all animals by day 15.  There were no other observed effects that could be attributed to the 
test  article.  The  NOEL  for  systemic  toxicity  was  set  at    the  highest  dose  tested  of  80  mg/kg/day.  
The NOEL for local inflammatory reactions was 5 mg/kg/day.   
In  a  4-week  SC  toxicity  study  in  rhesus  monkeys,  treatment-related  inflammatory  skin  lesions  were 
observed  in  5  of  10  animals  receiving  200  mg/kg/day.  Alterations  in  haematology  parameters  were 
also observed; elevations in white blood cell counts and decreased red blood cell parameters in a few 
animals. Proteinuria was more frequent in treated animals than in controls, but not seen in the recovery 
group.  Although  the  observed  proteinuria  was  treatment-related  it  was  considered  to  be  biologically 
4/21 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
irrelevant, because protein in urine appeared to be mainly excreted drug. Urine albumin and globulin 
levels,  indicators  of  proteinuria,  were  normal  in  all  animals.  Furthermore  there  were  no 
histopathologic lesions. 
A low incidence of antibodies was present for all treated groups. It is argued that the observed lower 
antibody  titer  in  high  dose  groups  compared  to  low  dose  groups  could  be  caused  by  the  high  drug 
levels interfering with the ability of the assay to detect antibody. Circulating drug would decrease the 
amount of antibody in a serum sample that would be detected. This phenomenon is well known with 
antibody-detecting assays. 
Haemolytic Staphylococcus was cultured from a lesion on one high dose female animal. It is believed 
that the bacteria were probably introduced into the subcutaneous tissue through the injection procedure 
and  that  the  observed  infection  is  therefore  not  an  indication  of  immune  suppression.  The  abscess 
responded only to topical treatment and did not progress to septicaemia, supporting an intact immune 
system. 
Enlarged peripheral lymph nodes were seen in 3 of 6 high dose animals and were considered to be a 
secondary  response  to  the  injection  site  lymphohistiocytic  inflammation.  This  is  thought  to  be 
suggestive of a functional immune cell response to antigenic stimulation. Thymus and spleen weight 
and histology showed no treatment-related changes.  
A one-week IV continuous infusion study was performed in male rhesus monkeys given anakinra 150 
mg/kg/day. A 2-week IV study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day.  
There  were  no  noted  toxic  effects  in  the  treated  animals  from  both  studies.    Antibodies  against 
anakinra were detected in all animals from the 2-week study. 
The  potential  for  anakinra  to  induce  QT  interval  prolongation  was  also  assessed  in  a  4-week  repeat 
dose combination study of anakinra with PEG sTNF-RI administered SC in monkeys. There were no 
significant  changes  in  QT  intervals  in  animals  treated  with  anakinra  alone  at  100  mg/kg  or  in 
combination with PEG sTNF-RI at doses up to 25 mg/kg. 
• 
Genotoxicity 
A  full  set  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  genotoxicity  tests  were  conducted  and  there  was  no  evidence  of 
genotoxicity associated with anakinra. 
• 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential has been evaluated with emphasis on: risk of direct tumour production; risk 
of tumour stimulation; indirect effects of anakinra on tumour growth. 
Risk  of  direct  tumour  production:  This  is  considered  unlikely,  as  anakinra  is  a  human  recombinant 
protein  and  also  as  anakinra  was  judged  non-mutagenic  in  mutagenicity  assays.  Furthermore  no 
treatment-related tumours were found in the 6-month rat study. 
Risk of tumour stimulation: Binding of anakinra to IL-1 receptors does not cause signal transduction. 
The  evidence  presented  indicates  that  anakinra  does  not  appear  to  directly  stimulate  mitogenesis  or 
cell  proliferation.  Anakinra  may  interact  with  tumours;  however,  any  putative  interaction  will  be 
dependent on IL-1 effects and the relative IL-1 levels. The relevance of these in vitro studies to predict 
the  direct  risk  of  cancer  for  patients  receiving  anakinra  treatment  is  difficult  to  ascertain  as  it  is 
presently unclear as to the role and extent that IL-1 plays in preventing certain tumours from growing. 
Indirect effects of anakinra on tumour growth: There was no evidence of immunosuppression in the rat 
and  monkey  toxicity  studies.  Anakinra  also  had  no  effect  on  specific  immune  functions  such  as 
antibody  formation  to  Keyhole  Limplet  Hemocyanin  or  cytotoxic  T  lymphocyte  response  in  mice. 
Additionally,  IL-1ra  stimulates  NK  cells  in  mice.  NK  cells  play  an  important  role  in  tumour 
surveillance. 
A  literature  search  reveals  no  published  data  on  increased  tumorigenicity  in  transgenic  or  knockout 
animals.  Seven  years  of  experience  with  IL-1ra  overexpressing  mice  and  IL-1ra  mutant  knock-out 
mice  have  been  provided  in  detail  from  the  Director  of  the  laboratory  that  produced  these  animals. 
There is apparently no increased carcinogenic risk in the knockout mice.

• 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility,  embryo-foetal  development  and  peri-,  post  natal  development  reproduction  studies  were 
conducted in rats and rabbits at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day.  There was no evidence of anakinra related 
reproduction toxicity. 
Studies with IL-1ra overexpressing mice and with mice deficient for the IL-1 type 1 receptor have also 
shown  normal  reproductive  capacity.  Repeated  IP  injections  of  IL-1ra  do  not  affect  embryo 
implantation in either wild type or IL-1 receptor deficient mice. 
Safety margins to human exposure were at least 15 fold for rabbits and 100 fold for rats. The highest 
dose  tested  in  the  reproductive  studies  i.e  200  mg/kg,  which  is  approximately  200-fold  the  intended 
clinical dose and 24-fold over the human exposure. 
IL-1ra is naturally present in high amounts in amniotic fluid, which is a strong argument that anakinra 
treatment poses no risk for reproduction toxicity or for impaired reproductive performance. 
• 
Local Tolerance 
No  formal  local  tolerance  studies  have  been  performed.  Microscopic  examination  of  the  SC  or  IV 
injection  sites  in  the  repeat  dose  studies  in  rats  and  monkeys  revealed  subacute  to  chronic 
inflammation  at  the  injection  site  (SC  studies)  or  perivascular  inflammation  (rat  IV  studies),  with 
incidence and severity tending to increase with dose. 
It has been shown in a study comparing mast cell degranulation, and inflammatory cell infiltration in 
rats  given  intradermal  injection  of  IL-1ra  or  its  vehicle,  that  skin  reactions  were  due  mostly  to  the 
vehicle  (CSEP)  intradermal  activity.  There  was  no  immunological  component  to  the  skin  reactions; 
therefore they were characterised as pesudoallergic. 
The presentation of injection site reactions is very different between patients and rats or monkeys. 
The leukocyte and lymphocyte infiltration seen in rats represents an expected antigenic response to the 
human  protein.  The strong local recruitment  of  inflammatory  cells at injection  sites  in the  6-months 
rats suggested that there was no immunosuppression. 
• 
Other toxicity (antigenicity, immunotoxicity and dependence) studies 
A relative increase in AUC was seen in rats and monkeys the longer-term repeat-dose studies and is 
thought to be connected to the antibody production by formation of anakinra-antibody complexes.  
The  applicant  has  developed  an  in  vitro  neutralising  antibody  assay  (bioassay)  and  a  biosensor 
(BIAcore) assay that offers improved sensitivity to low affinity antibodies. Neutralising potential was 
investigated and it was concluded that the antibody response in rats and monkeys is not neutralising. It 
has  been  shown  that the  anakinra antibodies had  lower affinity than the  positive control antibody  in 
both monkeys and rats. 
In the few existing animal disease models, anakinra retained its biological activity during the treatment 
period (4 weeks in a rat model, 14 days in another rat model). 
Immunotoxicity  studies  and  repeat-dose  studies  do  not  provide  evidence  for  anakinra-induced 
immunosuppression.  
The best and most used assay for evaluation of immunosuppression is the antibody forming cell assay 
to  sheep  red  blood  cells.    This  assay  requires  functional  T-  lymphocytes,  B-lymphocytes  and  APC 
macrophages.  Anakinra  treatment  did  not  result  in  immunosuppression  in  this  assay.  In  addition 
plaque  forming  and  NK  cell  activity  assays  did  not  provide  evidence  of  anakinra  mediated 
immunotoxicity.

• 
Ecotoxicity/Environmental Risk Assessment 
No significant impact to the environment is expected from the release of anakinra because of the small 
amounts potentially discharged, the high rate of biodegradation of the product, and the lack of toxicity 
at the low concentrations that is expected to be discharged. 
Anakinra is considered a non-hazardous biodegradable product. The environmental impact in terms of 
use and disposal of anakinra is expected to be negligible.

Part IV: Clinical aspects 
Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
Studies  specifically investigating  the  pharmacodynamic  action of  anakinra in  humans  have not  been 
performed.  As  pre-clinical  studies  have  adequately  described  the  pharmacodynamics  of  anakinra,  
the lack of such data is considered acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetics 
• 
General 
Following subcutaneous injection, anakinra is absorbed with  maximal plasma levels obtained within  
3 to 9 hours post injection.  The relative bioavailability of anakinra following subcutaneous injection 
is approximately 95%. 
Following intravenous injection, anakinra distributes initially into a volume of 3.6 L and subsequently 
distributes into a steady-state volume of 9 to 15 L.  These volume-of distribution data were consistent 
with  the  initial  distribution  into  the  physiological  plasma  volume  (3  L)  and  subsequent  distribution 
into a steady-state distribution volume that approximates the extracellular volume (18.2 L). 
The  effect  of  choice  of  injection  site  was  not  investigated.    The  recommendation  in  the  SPC  and 
patient  information  leaflet  is  therefore  that;  patients  should  rotate  the  injection  site,  which  includes 
thigh, arm, and abdomen and is based on the anakinra clinical studies, where subjects were instructed 
to rotate the site of injection. 
Following intravenous infusion, anakinra is eliminated fairly rapidly with a half-life of approximately 
3 hours.  The clearance is about 150 ml/min and is correlated to renal creatinine clearance.  Clearance 
was modestly higher than the estimated glomerular filtration rate.  These data suggest that in humans 
(like  in  animals),  anakinra  is  predominantly  eliminated  via  the  kidneys.    However,  the  route  of 
elimination has not been studied directly in humans.  Urinary recovery of anakinra in humans was low 
suggesting  that  anakinra  filtered  in  the  glomeruli  is  absorbed  and  metabolised  by  the  renal  tubular 
cells.   
Following  subcutaneous  injection,  the  terminal  half-life  of  anakinra  is  longer  than  after  intravenous 
injection (3 to 9.5 hours versus 2 hours), reflecting the effect of the slower absorption rate following 
subcutaneous injection. 
In  the  dose-range  studied  (1  to  10 mg/kg)  the  pharmacokinetics  of  anakinra  was  linear.   
No accumulation was observed after repeated subcutaneous administration of up to 2.0 mg/kg/day of 
anakinra.    Repeated  administration  of  higher  doses  (4.0 mg/kg/day)  resulted  in  the  accumulation  of 
anakinra.   
The clearance of anakinra is slightly reduced (10 to 15%) in the elderly above 65 years of age and in 
females  compared  to  healthy  younger  males  (age  below  65  years).    However,  when  correcting  for 
differences  in  creatinine  clearance  and  body  weight,  there  was  no  effect  of  gender  and  age  on  the 
clearance of anakinra.   
Clearance  of  anakinra  is  only  moderately  reduced  in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  
Thus, no dosage adjustment is considered necessary for this population.   
Patients  with  mild  to  moderate  renal  insufficiency  were  included  in  the  pivotal  clinical  trials.   
The safety profile of anakinra in patients with mild renal insufficiency was similar to the safety profile 
in patients with normal renal function.  The safety profile of anakinra in a limited number of patients 
with moderate renal insufficiency did not indicate any safety concerns.

As  to  be  expected  clearance  of  anakinra  was  significantly  impaired  in  patients  with  severe  renal 
insufficiency.  This results in a higher exposure after single dose administration.  The magnitude of the 
difference of exposure following repeated administration between patients with normal renal function 
and patients with severe renal impairment is unknown.  As no studies have been performed in patients 
with severe renal insufficiency and as clinically important increases in exposure cannot be ruled out in 
this  population,  anakinra  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with  severe  renal  insufficiency.    A  warning 
statement has been included in the SPC.

Interaction studies 
There  is  no  evidence  that  any  important  PK  interaction  with  NSAIDs  or  corticosteroids  or  other 
concomitant  drugs  used  by  rheumatoid  arthritis  patients,  could  reasonably  be  anticipated  when 
anakinra is given to patients with RA. Based on the current evidence available it is believed that the 
interaction  potential  of  anakinra  is  low.  Therefore  no  pharmacokinetic  or  pharmacodynamic 
interaction  studies  were  performed.  Considering  the  nature  of  the  product  and  its  pharmacokinetics, 
this is considered acceptable. 
Overall the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic documentation for anakinra is acceptable.  
Clinical efficacy  
Clinical studies presented were performed complying with Good Clinical Practice principals according 
to  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Good  Clinical  practice  for  trails  on  Medicinal  Products  from  the 
European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. 
Dose response studies 
The  phase  II  studies  conducted  by  the  applicant  provided  evidence  for  the  choice  of  administration 
frequency  but  does  not  justify  any  selection  of  dose.  Dose  selection  is  based  on  the  results  of  the 
pivotal trials. 
Main Studies  
Description of the studies 
The trials 0560 (with its extension study 0564 and following open-label extension studies 0564E1, E2, 
E3) and 960180 (with its extension study 960181), involving 891 patients with RA, were designed to 
provide  evidence  of  safety  and  efficacy  of  anakinra  in  RA.    To  support  the  claim  for  combination 
treatment  with  other  DMARDs,  the  applicant  has  submitted  a  confirmatory  efficacy  analysis  from 
study 990145 and an interim analysis of safety data from study 990757.   
(cid:131)  Study 0560 
This  study  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre,  dose-ranging  study 
designed  to  determine  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  anakinra  (30,  75  or  150 mg)  administered 
subcutaneously once daily for 24 weeks in patients with RA. 
Study 0564 was an extension of study 0560.  This study was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 
non-placebo controlled, parallel-group study of anakinra in subjects with RA, to determine the long-
term  efficacy  and  safety  of  anakinra  (30,  75  or  150 mg)  administered  subcutaneously  once  daily  in 
patients with  RA.  Subjects completing study 0560 and who received placebo were randomised in a 
blinded fashion to receive one of three doses of anakinra.  Subjects completing study 0560 and who 
received anakinra, continued to receive the same dose of anakinra in a blinded fashion. 
(cid:131)  Study 960180 
This study  was a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled (add-on to MTX),  multicentre,  dose-
ranging study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of anakinra administered subcutaneously 
once  daily  in  patients  with  RA  who  are  receiving  concomitant  treatment  with  stable  doses  of 
methotrexate (MTX) and folic acid. 
(cid:131)  Study 990145 
Study  990145  was  a  multi-centre,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  trial  to  study  the 
ability  of  anakinra  to  retard  joint  destruction,  and  to  evaluate  the  long  term  safety  of  anakinra  in 
8/21 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects with RA.  A confirmatory efficacy analysis from study 990145, which included 501 patients 
on a fixed dose of 100 mg/day, compared clinical outcome in patients already receiving MTX treated 
with  either  anakinra  or  placebo.    While  the  study  was  designed  primarily  to  assess  the  effects  of 
anakinra  on  joint  destruction,  the  analysis  provided  in  support  of  this  application  also  examined  the  
6-month  effects  of  anakinra  in  combination  with  MTX  (N  =  250)  versus  MTX  alone  (N  =  251)  on 
signs and symptoms using the ACR composite score.   
Primary endpoints/assays 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  exhibiting  at  least  a  20%  improvement  from 
baseline  in  the  ACR  score  (ACR20).    A  patient  is  defined  as  having  at  least  a  20%  improvement  in 
ACR20 score if all of the following criteria are fulfilled:  
(cid:131)  At least a 20% decrease from baseline in the number of tender/painful joints and the number of 
swollen joints,  
(cid:131)  20%  improvement  in  at  least  3  out  of  the  following  5  assessments:  subjects  assessment  of 
disease  activity,  investigator’s  assessment  of  disease  activity,  subjects  assessment  of  pain, 
health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) disability score, acute phase reactant (CRP). 
For study 0560 and study 960180, the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved 
an ACR20 response at week 24 and week 12 respectively.   
In the anakinra pivotal trials, which pre-dated the issued EU guidance (CPMP “Points to Consider on 
slow-acting  anti-rheumatic  medicinal  products  in  rheumatoid  arthritis”  (CPMP/EWP/556/95)),  
the  pre-specified  primary  efficacy  endpoints  used  the  American  College  of  Rheumatology  (ACR) 
definition  of  improvement  in  RA.    This  endpoint  utilises  an  aggregate,  validated  composite  of  the 
patient’s clinical status from both the physician’s and the patient’s perspective, and includes all of the 
measures noted in the guidance document. 
Improvement criteria such as the ACR and EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) criteria 
are  becoming  increasingly  accepted  in  rheumatology  practice  as  an  appropriate,  validated  primary 
measure of efficacy.  Study 0560 was the only study designed to investigate structural damage from 
data on radiological progression.  In the protocol, the Larsen score was the method chosen to evaluate 
the  effect  of  anakinra  in  retarding  structural  damage.    Radiographs  were  also  evaluated  using  the 
Modified Sharp Score (TMSS). 
Statistical analysis 
(cid:131)  Study 0560 
The primary efficacy population was a modified intention-to-treat (M-ITT) population defined as all 
subjects receiving at least one dose of study drug and having at least one post baseline measurement 
for  the  endpoint  being  evaluated.    For  missing  data  the  last  observation  carried  forward  principle 
(LOCF)  was  used.    Analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  parameter  (fraction  of  patients  experiencing  a 
20%  or  greater  improvement  in  ACR20  at  week  24)  was  performed  by  3  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH)  tests  pair  wise  comparing  each  dose  of  anakinra  against  placebo.    An  Agresti-Coull  test  for 
dose-response was also performed. 
Furthermore  in order to  account for the  missing radiographs for  77  subjects, the  0560 clinical  study 
report incorporated numerous sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of missing radiographs on study 
outcome.  These consisted of: 
- 
- 
simulated worst-case analyses  
an ITT analysis that included all subjects randomised and assumed subjects with missing data 
had radiographic progression 
evaluation of baseline characteristics among subjects included/excluded from the analysis 
relationship between the ACR20 response and Larsen scores.   
- 
- 
(cid:131)  Study 960180 
The primary efficacy population was the ITT population defined as all subjects who were randomised 
to  treatment  irrespective  of  whether  or  not  they  received  treatment.    The  primary  safety  population 
consisted  of  all  patients  receiving  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication.    Analysis  of  the  primary 
efficacy  parameter  (proportion  of  patients  experiencing  a  20%  or  greater  improvement  in  ACR20 
response criteria at week 12) was performed by an initial test for trend using a Likelihood Ratio Test 
with adjustment for centre.  If a statistically significant dose-response relationship was observed, pair-
wise  comparison  of  each  anakinra  dose  against  placebo  were  performed.    For  the  pair-wise 
9/21 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
comparisons,  a  logit  model  including  centre  and  treatment  effect  was  used.    Exploratory  analyses 
investigating the effect of various baseline covariates were also performed.  These analyses singularly 
introduced  each  covariate  into  the  previously  described  logit  model  to  assess  the  impact  of  these 
covariates. 
(cid:131)  Study 990145 
The primary analysis for the ACR20 response rate at week 24 was a logistic regression model adjusted 
for  centre.    Efficacy  analyses  for  dichotomous  secondary  endpoints  (ACR50,  ACR70,  and  sustained 
ACR20) used a similar logistic regression model.  Continuous secondary endpoints (ACR components 
and duration of morning stiffness) were analysed with a repeated measures mixed model.  All efficacy 
analyses were performed at a 2-tailed alpha level of 0.05. 
Safety analysis consisted of the crude and exposure-adjusted subject incidence rates of adverse events 
and serious adverse events, including serious infectious episodes. 
Results 
(cid:131)  Study 0560 
Study  0560  provided  evidence  that  in  a  mixed  RA  population  including  both  DMARD  naïve  and 
DMARD experienced patients, 24 weeks of treatment with anakinra 150 mg once daily is superior to 
placebo as regards reduction of disease activity.

The proportion of subjects achieving an ACR20 response was greater for all anakinra groups compared 
to  placebo.    Using  Dunnett’s  adjustment  for  multiple  comparisons,  only  the  150 mg  dose  had  a 
significant effect on the ACR20 response.   
A significantly higher proportion of subjects receiving anakinra 150 mg achieved Good or Moderate 
EULAR  response  at  week  24  compared  to  subjects  receiving  placebo  (p  =  0.005).    In  addition  a 
significantly  higher  proportion  of  subjects  receiving  any  dose  of  anakinra  also  achieved  Good  or 
Moderate EULAR response at week 24 compared to subjects receiving placebo (p = 0.046). 
The extension study 0564 provided some evidence that the efficacy of anakinra was maintained for at 
least 48 weeks. 
The efficacy of anakinra monotherapy was not compared to that of other DMARDS.  Thus, the data 
presented are considered insufficient to support a claim for a first line indication for anakinra in the 
treatment in RA.   
Some  subjects  included  in  study  0560  were  intolerant  to/have  failed  previous  DMARD  treatment.  
Although  a  higher  proportion  of  subjects  who  received  anakinra  achieved  an  ACR20  response 
compared  to  subjects  receiving  placebo,  due  to  small  sample  sizes,  efficacy  was  not  clearly 
demonstrated  in  these  subjects  with  prior  DMARD  experience.    Therefore  the  study  is  considered 
insufficient to support a claim for a second line indication for anakinra in the treatment in RA patients 
who have failed other therapies.   
As only patients who completed study 0560 were eligible for inclusion in study 0564, the risk of “self-
selection” favouring inclusion of patients who have some benefit from treatment without experiencing 
significant side effects was discussed.  Although it has been  demonstrated that the group of patients 
continuing in study 0564 did not differ from the group of patients included in study 0560 as regards 
demographic  and  disease  characteristics,  the  risk  of  “self-selection”  was  taken  into  account  when 
interpreting the results.  A sensitivity analysis presented for ACR20 at week 24 based on the intention 
to treat  population, indicated that self-selection  did  not  appear to  have  had any major impact on the 
results. 
11/21 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
In study 0560 and 0564, the potential effect on study outcome with respect to concomitant medication 
(27 - 58% of the patients receiving steroids) was examined.  The analyses provided by the applicant 
demonstrates that the concomitant medication had no impact on the results. 
In  study  0560,  protocol  violations  involving  concomitant  medication  were  relatively  frequent.   
To  investigate  the  effect  of  these  protocol  violations,  supplementary  analyses  where  subjects  with 
protocol violations were considered as non-responders, were also performed. 
Study  0560  provided  evidence  that  anakinra  significantly  decreases  the  rate  of  radiographic 
progression  of  disease  over  a  period  of  48  weeks.    Subjects  treated  with  anakinra  for  48  weeks 
demonstrated  a  significant  slowing  of  radiographic  progression  seen  as  early  as  24  weeks  after 
initiating  treatment.    This  reduction  of  radiographic  progression  was  shown  to  be  sustained  for  a 
further 24 weeks of anakinra treatment.  At least 50% of subjects showed no further erosions and no 
further joint space narrowing after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment.  However, because the radiographic 
data  does  not  fully  conform  with  the  CPMP  “Points  to  consider  on  slow-acting  anti-rheumatic 
medicinal products in rheumatoid arthritis” (CPMP/EWP/556/95), a formal DCART claim cannot be 
granted. 
(cid:131)  Study 960180 
A total of 419 subjects were randomised and included in the ITT dataset.  
This study demonstrated that in RA patients who are inadequately controlled on MTX, the addition of 
anakinra is superior to placebo as regards reduction of disease activity. 
The  result  is  clearly  in  favour  of  anakinra  at  1.0 mg/kg,  where  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of 
patients (27%) achieved an ACR20 response over the placebo group at the primary efficacy endpoint.

Despite  the  relative  low  number  of  patients  in  this  group  (n = 59),  the  results  for  the  1.0 mg/kg 
anakinra  group  appear  to  be  robust  to  possible  bias  caused  by  discontinuation,  and  potential 
unblinding due to injection site reactions (ISR).  The effect of anakinra appears to be present across 
the  population  irrespectively  of  factors  such  as  sex,  age,  duration  of  disease,  previous  DMARD  use 
etc.   
For  study  960180,  a  higher  proportion  of  subjects  receiving  anakinra  1.0 mg/kg  achieved  Good  or 
Moderate EULAR response at week 24 compared to subjects receiving placebo.  Although the results 
trended towards an effect, the result was not statistically significant (p = 0.059). 
Furthermore,  the  magnitude  of  clinical  response  increased  significantly  across  the  doses  explored.  
The proportion of subjects achieving an ACR50 response or ACR70 response was higher in subjects in 
most  anakinra  dose  groups  compared  with  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  at  24  weeks  and  most 
pronounced in 2 highest anakinra dose groups.

The  data  presented  supports  that  anakinra  100 mg/day  is  superior  to  placebo  in  reducing  signs  and 
symptoms of disease activity in RA patients inadequately controlled on MTX alone.   
The  original  dose  proposal  was  “at  least  1.0 mg/kg”  based  upon  an  integrated  weight-normalised 
analysis  of  the  0560  and  960180  data.    Although  study  990180  used  a  somewhat  different  dosing 
regimen to that of study 990145 (0.04 mg/kg to 2.0 mg/kg once daily in study 990180 compared to a 
fixed  dose  of  100 mg/day  in  study  990145),  the  two  studies  taken  together  supports  the  efficacy  of 
anakinra 100 mg/day. 
The efficacy of anakinra in combination with other DMARDs other than MTX has not been studied.  
The efficacy of anakinra has been demonstrated in combination with MTX only and this is the only 
indication for which approval is sought. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Data  available  do  not  indicate  that  the  efficacy  of  anakinra  differs  between  elderly  (age > 65 years) 
and non-elderly (age < 65 years) patients.  Based on population pharmacokinetics, age does not appear 
to  have  a  significant  independent  effect  on  anakinra  elimination.    However,  there  are  no  data  on 
exposure  levels  in  elderly.    As  elderly  patients  have  lower  body  weight  and  different  body 
composition than younger subjects, exposure levels will be higher than expected based solely on the 
difference in renal clearance.  Safety data from study 990145 suggests that anakinra is not markedly 
different  in  patient  below  and  above  65  years.    As  the  risk  of  infections  is  increased  in  the  elderly 
population, an appropriate warning has been included in the SPC. 
Studies have not been carried out in children.

Exploratory analysis performed across trials (subset analyses) 
In study 0560, a series of subset analyses were performed to examine if the positive effects observed 
for anakinra were mediated by baseline covariates.  The applicant has demonstrated that the effect of 
anakinra  is  distributed  uniformly  across  the  study  population.    The  evidence  presented  does  not 
indicate  that  the  effect  of  anakinra  decreases  in  patients  with  more  severe  disease.    However  the 
analyses presented are not considered sufficient to support a second-line indication. 
Data summaries on the percentage of responders by treatment groups have been provided for studies 
960180 and 0560.  As regards the individual components of the ACR composite, anakinra improves 
all components except for tender joint count.  The proportion of patients achieving 20% improvement 
of the individual components  was  generally higher  in the  anakinra group  than in the placebo  group, 
supporting the conclusions of the primary analysis.   
Also as regards the EULAR response criteria, anakinra appears superior to placebo.  As requested by 
the CPMP, a statistical analysis of the differences between the EULAR response rates for anakinra and 
placebo  was  performed  for  studies  0560  and  960180.    In  the  individual  pivotal  studies  0560  and 
960180,  higher  proportions  of  subjects  either  receiving  anakinra  150 mg  or  1.0 mg/kg  achieved  a 
Good or Moderate EULAR response at week 24 compared to subjects receiving placebo.

Adverse events and serious adverse event/deaths 
Generally the safety profile of anakinra appears acceptable.  Apart from injection sites reactions (ISR), 
anakinra is generally well tolerated.  ISR are common but usually mild to moderate and not requiring 
discontinuation.  In addition to ISR, headache, abdominal pain and rash occurred more frequently in 
patients treated with anakinra compared to patients who received placebo.   
Anakinra was associated with a small risk of hypersensitivity reactions.  None of these involved true 
anaphylactic  shock.    However,  the  SPC  includes  an  appropriate  warning  about  this  risk  and 
instructions about necessary measures in case of hypersensitivity.  Compared to placebo, anakinra was 
not associated with an overall increased risk of serious adverse events.   
The  data  suggest  that  anakinra  may  also  be  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  serious 
infections.  The incidence of serious infections in the placebo- controlled trials was 1.8% for anakinra 
subjects and 0.7% in the  placebo subjects.  It  must  be concluded that the results of study 990757 in 
combination  with  the  previously  reported  studies  demonstrate  that  anakinra  is  associated  with  an 
increased risk of serious infections.  The type of infections associated with anakinra treatment does not 
appear substantially different from what can be observed in a heavily treated RA population.  Provided 
that adequate measures are taken, this problem is considered to be manageable.  It should be stressed 
that all immunosuppression is associated with an increased risk of infection.  The importance of this 
17/21 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
risk  must  always  be  weighed  against  the  risks  of  the  disease  itself  and  the  efficacy  of  the  drug.   
The SPC warns about this and provides adequate recommendations as regards special precautions. 
The available data does not suggest that anakinra has any negative effect on renal function in humans.  
The  incidence  of  serious  and  non-serious  adverse  events  related  to  the  renal  system  did  not  differ 
significantly between placebo and anakinra treated patients.  Proteinuria was present at baseline in a 
substantial  number  of  patients  in  both  the  anakinra  and  the  placebo  group.    The  fraction  of  patients 
experiencing deterioration of proteinuria or proteinuria “de novo” was similar in anakinra and placebo 
treated  patients.    This  was  also  true  for  haematuria.    Patients  with  significant  proteinuria  were 
identified.  None of the cases were associated with abnormal serum creatinin.  Significant proteinuria 
was not constant and in most cases patients entered the study with proteinuria.   
Anakinra was not associated with any clinically relevant effect on vital signs or with any significant 
adverse effect on renal function.   
Exposure  adjusted  death  and  malignancy  rates  during  anakinra  exposure  were  not  significantly 
different from what is expected in a similar untreated population.  However, the duration of exposure 
and  hence  the  number  of  cases  in  the  safety  database  is  relative  small.    Thus  the  estimates  of  the 
number  of  malignancies  are  relatively  imprecise.    While  the  data  seem  to  rule  out  that  anakinra  is 
associated with a  major increase in  the  risk  of  malignancies, a  smaller increase cannot  be ruled out.  
Such  effects  can  only  be  estimated  after  larger  scale  exposure.    Consequently,  the  applicant  has 
proposed a post-marketing surveillance program designed to address this issue.   
Study 990145 provided supportive evidence that the safety profile of anakinra and MTX is similar to 
the safety profile of anakinra monotherapy.  Compared to placebo, anakinra treatment (with or without 
MTX)  is  associated  with  significantly  higher  risk  of  injection  site  reactions  although  the  majority 
(95%)  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.    Furthermore,  infections  appear  more  common  in  the 
anakinra group than in the placebo group.   
Study 990757 was designed to provide additional supportive data evaluating the safety of anakinra in a 
controlled clinical trial setting with a large number of subjects (N = 1414) who were representative of 
a  broad  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  population.    These  subjects  were  receiving  a  broad  range  of 
DMARDs and in some cases, multiple DMARDs. 
This study confirmed previous safety experience and is considered supportive for the general safety of 
anakinra.  Anakinra is associated with increased risk of ISR, but these are generally mild to moderate 
and  rarely  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment.    As  to  be  expected  due  to  its  pharmacodynamic 
effect, anakinra was also associated with an increased risk of serious infections (1.8% in the anakinra 
group  compared  to  0.7%  in  the  placebo  group).    The  spectrum  of  infections  was  generally 
unremarkable  and  infections  resolved  upon  discontinuation  of  anakinra  treatment  and  initiation  of 
appropriate  antibiotic  treatment.    The  present  data  does  not  indicate  that  anakinra  treatment  is 
associated with an increased incidence of malignancies.   
Combination treatment with anakinra and TNF-alpha blockers cannot be recommended at the present 
time, as clinical evidence of the safety and efficacy of the combination has not been established.   
There were no deaths related to adverse events. 
Laboratory findings 
Apart  from  decreases  in  WBC  and  ANC  count,  anakinra  was  not  associated  with  any  clinically 
relevant changes in laboratory parameters.  In a minority of patients the decrease in WBC and ANC 
count appears excessive and at least potentially harmful.  Although no clinical sequelae were reported 
and the leucopenia appears reversible, anakinra should not be used in patients with leucopenia and/or 
neutropenia.  Furthermore during anakinra treatment, WBC and ANC counts should be monitored and 
appropriate warnings and recommendations are stated in section 4.4 of the SPC.   
The data on antibody response to anakinra indicates that the risk of development of antibodies against 
anakinra  is  low  and  that  presence  of  antibodies  is  not  associated  with  adverse  effects  or  lack  of 
efficacy.  The adverse event profile of the subjects who provided a positive response in neutralising 
antibody tests to anakinra was unremarkable.  It is concluded that neutralising antibodies are rare and 
even if they do occur, the limited data does not indicate that they are of clinical relevance. 
Safety in special populations 
Detailed  examination  of  the  anakinra  safety  database  confirms  that  RA  patients  with  a  history  of 
asthma can be safely treated with anakinra.  With respect to worsening of asthma, no recommendation 
for caution in the use of anakinra in patients with a history of asthma is required. 
18/21 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
The  available  data  does  not  suggest  that  the  safety  profile  of  anakinra  differs  between  patients  with 
normal renal function and patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  This conclusion is based 
on  a  relatively  large  population  of  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment  (400  patients)  and  a  smaller 
population of patients with  moderate renal impairment.  Based on these numbers it is appropriate to 
allow use in mild renal impairment without any restrictions. 
Anakinra  can  be  used  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment.    However  caution  should  be 
exercised due to the limited experience in these patients.  Because of the documented higher exposure 
and lack of safety data in patients with severe renal impairment, anakinra should be contraindicated in 
these patients. 
Post Marketing surveillance: 
Patients treated with Kineret and etanercept were observed to have a higher rate of serious infection 
when compared with historical controls that were treated with Kineret. In addition, in a double-blind 
placebo-controlled  trial  in  patients  receiving  background  methotrexate,  patients  treated  with  Kineret 
and etanercept were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections and neutropenia than patients 
treated with etanercept (see section 4.4).  
The  MAH  has  submitted  data  from  the  Amgen  clinical  trials  (20000125  and  20000223)  an  updated 
draft  SmPC  and  Clinical  Expert  report  and  copies  of  the  CIOMS  forms  relating  to  the  reports  of 
serious infections 
The study 20000223 was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, and active-controlled study with a 
duration of 24 weeks.  RA patients on a stable MTX dose of 10-25 mg/week with active disease were 
randomised to one of 3 treatment arms: 
Group 1: Etanercept 25 mg twice weekly 
Group 2: Etanercept 25 mg once weekly + anakinra 100mg daily  
Group 3: Etanercept 25 mg twice weekly + anakinra 100 mg daily 
Therapy was initiated in 242 patients, with 80 patients in Group 1, and 81 patients each in Groups 2 
and 3.   
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  improvements  of  50% 
according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria at 24 weeks (ACR-50). 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  improvements  of  20% 
(ACR-20) and 70% (ACR-70) at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. 
Efficacy results 
The  efficacy  results  showed  that  there  was  no  beneficit  in  patients  receiving  combination  treatment 
with etanercept and anakinra when compared to patients receiving etanercept alone. Comparisons of 
the  ACR-50  response  at  week  24  demonstrated  no  significant  differences  between  the  3  treatment 
groups, the result were 41%, 39% and 31% in group 1,2 and 3 respectively. 
Safety results 
Overall, 204 of the 242 patients enrolled in the study completed the study. 75 in group 1, 63 in group 2 
and  66  in  Group  3.    The  differences  in  withdrawal  rates  in  the  combined-therapy  groups  were 
attributed to occurrence of adverse effects. A total of 13 subjects in the combination groups withdrew 
due to adverse events, compared to no subjects in the etanercept alone group. Injection site reactions 
were  reported  in  69%  of  patients  receiving  combination  therapy  compared  to  40%  in  the  etanercept 
alone group. Other frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infections (15%) 
and nausea (10%). 
A total of 26 patients reported serious adverse events. The proportion of patients in the combination 
treatment groups who reported serious adverse events (21/162, 13%) was twice the number seen in the 
etanercept alone group (5/80, 6%). The most commonly reported serious adverse event were injection 
site  pain  (3),  pneumonia  (3)  and  cellulitis  (3).    These  were  reported  in  patients  taking  combination 
therapy.

Serious infections 
Serious  infections  were  experienced  by  9/162  (6%)  of  patients  receiving  combination  therapy.  
No patients in the etanercept alone group (Group 1) experienced any serious infections. The reported 
infections  were:  Pneumonia  (3),  Cellulitis(3),Herpes  zoster,Pyelonephritis,Pneumonitis  (1  each).  
In  2  cases,  one  of  cellulitis  and  one  of  pneumonitis,  the  investigator  considered  the  infection  to  be 
unrelated  to  the  study  drugs.  Of  the  3  patients  with  cellulitis,  one  had  diabetes  requiring  insulin 
therapy, one had an antecedent wound, and all three patients were also being treated with prednisone. 
Of  the  three  patients  with  pneumonia,  one  had  asthma  and  the  diagnosis  of  pneumonia  was  not 
supported by laboratory investigations in another patient 
One patient  had a fatal outcome. This was a  70 year old female who  was  on  concomitant treatment 
with MTX (15mg/week) and rofecoxib (25mg twice daily). The patient developed a wound infection 
after  seven  weeks  of  therapy.  She  was  subsequently  hospitalised  with  antibiotic  associated 
gastroenteritis.  The  patient  died  of  acute  respiratory  failure  which  was  attributed  to  pulmonary 
fibrosis.

Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Viral  Safety  and  Batch  to  batch  consistency  has  been  documented  and  the  relevant  test  will  be 
performed according to the agreed specifications. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that through its antagonist 
function, anakinra inhibits the action of the IL-1 cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β which are considered to 
be  critical  mediators  of  inflammation  and  joint  damage  in  RA.    The  general  pharmacology  studies 
indicated  that  the  safety  pharmacology  profile  was  acceptable,  concerning  central/autonomic, 
analgesic activity, anti-inflammatory activity, cardiovascular, digestive or renal functions. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed low toxicity of anakinra even at high single or repeated 
doses.  Some indications of kidney toxicity seen in rats were concluded to be related to anti-anakinra 
antibody formation which is anticipated not to pose a problem in the clinical situation. 
Efficacy 
Studies 0560 and 990180 indicated that anakinra given as monotherapy or in combination with MTX, 
respectively, is superior to placebo as concerns reduction of signs and symptoms of disease activity in 
patients with RA.   
However since the efficacy of anakinra was not compared to that of established therapy (e.g. MTX), a 
first  line  monotherapy  indication  was  not  considered  acceptable.    Furthermore,  as  the  placebo 
controlled  study  included  a  mixed  population  of  both  DMARD  naïve  and  DMARD  experienced 
patients, it was not clearly demonstrated that anakinra (as monotherapy) would be effective in patients 
unresponsive to previous DMARDs.  Based on these objections, only the indication for “treatment of 
the  signs  and  symptoms  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  combination  with  methotrexate,  in  patients 
inadequately controlled on methotrexate alone” was considered acceptable.   
Although  this  indication  was  supported  by  the  originally  submitted  study  960180,  the  CPMP 
considered that the sample size of this study was insufficient to provide robust evidence of the efficacy 
of anakinra.   In  order to respond to  the  concerns of the  CPMP, the applicant provided  confirmatory 
efficacy  data  on  signs  and  symptoms  of  disease  activity  from  the  ongoing  study  990145,  primarily 
designed to investigate the effect of 100 mg/day anakinra plus MTX on the progression of structural 
damage in patients with RA.   
After  initiating  the  study,  but  before  breaking  the  blind,  the  applicant  prospectively  designed  a 
confirmatory analysis of the signs and symptoms data of all subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of study 
drug.    This  analysis,  which  included  501  patients  demonstrated  that  the  ACR20  response  rate  is 
statistically significantly higher with anakinra (plus MTX) than with placebo (plus MTX): 38% versus 
22%,  p = 0.00005.    Although  study  960180  used  a  somewhat  different  dosing  regimen  than  study 
20/21 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
990145  (0.04 mg/kg  to  2.0 mg/kg  s.c.  once  daily  in  study  990180  compared  to  a  fixed  dose  of 
100 mg/day  in  study  990145),  the  two  studies  taken  together  supports  the  efficacy  of  anakinra 
100 mg/day.   
The  validity  of  this  analysis  as  an  appropriate  basis  for  the  approval  of  a  drug  was  debated  by  the 
CPMP  and  was  defended  by  the  applicant  at  an  oral  explanation  held  on  17  October  2001.   
The applicant’s claim that the analysis presented is the final analysis of signs and symptoms and that 
no  other  analysis  will  be  performed  on  the  signs  and  symptoms  endpoint  was  accepted  on  the  basis 
that that the signs and symptoms analysis was prospectively defined and documented prior to the blind 
break i.e.: 
(cid:131)  Clearly stated objective and hypothesis (confirmation of signs and symptoms) 
(cid:131)  Specified primary endpoint of ACR20 at 6 months 
(cid:131)  Prospectively determined sample size (n = 500) 
(cid:131)  Tested at 0.05 alpha level which excludes the opportunity for any further confirmatory analysis 
of signs and symptoms. 
Safety 
The  size  of  the  safety  database  of  anakinra  fulfils  the  requirement  of  the  relevant  ICH  Guideline.  
Furthermore the size of the safety database compares favourably with the size of safety databases of 
anti-TNF  products  recently  approved  for  similar  indications.    The  safety  profile  of  anakinra  is 
acceptable  for  this  type  of  product.    Injection  site  reactions  (ISR)  are  common  but  rarely  severe  or 
require discontinuation.  Neutropenia occurs in approximately 2.5% of treated patients.  In most cases, 
neutropenia is mild and reversible even during continued treatment.  However, more severe cases have 
been  reported  and  a  few  of  these  patients  had  infections,  although  none  of  these  infections  were 
serious.    Provided  that  adequate  precautions  are  taken,  this  risk  is  considered  manageable.   
As concerns  serious infections, anakinra is associated with  a small but increased risk.   This is to  be 
expected and has required warnings in the SPC and adequate precautions during use.  The present data 
does  not  indicate  that  anakinra  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  malignancies.    However,  the 
limited  duration  of  exposure  does  not  allow  any  firm  conclusions  on  this  question.    Finally,  a  few 
cases  of  positive  results  from  neutralising  antibody  tests  with  anakinra  have  been  reported.   
The  presence  of  these  antibodies  was,  however,  not  associated  with  any  clinically  relevant  adverse 
events.  Overall, the safety of anakinra has been adequately demonstrated. 
Post-marketing  surveillance  is  necessary.    The  applicant  proposes  to  address  the  issue  of  long  term 
safety  (especially  cancer  and  infections)  by  setting  up  a  case-control  study  in  collaboration  with 
British Society of Rheumatology (BSR).  Currently the BSR have set up a prospectively defined case-
control study involving patients with RA who are treated with anti-TNF medication.  The aim of the 
study is to investigate the potential effect of anti-TNF therapy on risk of malignancies.  The applicant 
is  planning  to  make  an  agreement  with  BSR  to  include  patients  treated  with  anakinra  in  the  above-
mentioned study. 
Concurrent  administration  of  etanercept  and  Kineret  has  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
serious infections and neutropenia.  This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; 
such use is not recommended . 
Benefit/risk assessment 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that the benefit/risk profile of Kineret was favourable in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of 
rheumatoid  arthritis  in  combination  with  methotrexate,  in  patients  with  an  inadequate  response  to 
methotrexate alone.

Summary of risk management plan for KEVZARA (Sarilumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for KEVZARA. The RMP details 
important risks of KEVZARA how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about KEVZARA’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
KEVZARA’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how KEVZARA 
should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for KEVZARA should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
KEVZARA’s RMP. 
I.  THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
KEVZARA in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of 
moderately to severely active RA in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or 
who are intolerant to one or more Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARDs). 
KEVZARA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment 
with MTX is inappropriate (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains sarilumab as the 
active substance and it is given by subcutaneous route.  
Further information about the evaluation of KEVZARA’s benefits can be found in 
KEVZARA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
medicines agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/kevzara 
II.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of KEVZARA, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about KEVZARA’s risks, are outlined in the next 
sections.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
 The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
 The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of KEVZARA, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, outlined in the next 
sections. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of KEVZARA are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of KEVZARA. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk minimization measures 
The important risk was defined based on in-depth review of the literature on 
IL-6, review and analysis of non-clinical findings, as well as of clinical safety 
data observed with sarilumab during the clinical development program. 
Consistent with the mechanism of action, sarilumab administration is 
associated with an increase in the rate of infections, including serious 
infections.  
Known risk factors for infections include increased age, medical history of 
diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, use of 
concomitant immunosuppressant (eg, MTX).a

Risk factors and risk groups  
The important risk was defined based on in-depth review of the literature on 
IL-6, review and analysis of non-clinical findings, as well as of clinical safety 
data observed with sarilumab during the clinical development program. 
Sarilumab administration was associated with laboratory abnormality of 
decreased neutrophil count, consistent with its mechanism of action. 
Neutropenia was not associated with increased incidence of infection.
Subgroup analyses on the placebo-controlled population (Pool 1) and 
sarilumab + DMARD long-term safety population (Pool 2) were conducted for 
ANC <1.0 Giga/L according to age, gender, race, ethnicity, BMI, weight, 
geographic region, RA duration of disease, RA functional class, prior biologic 
use, baseline steroid use MTX dose, concomitant DMARD use (ie, MTX or 
non-MTX), and baseline ANC <5.99 Giga/L. As anticipated due to the mean 
decrease in ANC in patients on sarilumab, a numerically higher incidence of 
ANC <1.0 Giga/L was observed in patients with baseline ANC <5.99 Giga/L in 
both the placebo-controlled population and sarilumab + DMARD long-term 
safety population. A numerically higher incidence of ANC <1.0 Giga/L was also 
observed in patients with weight <60 kg. Weight has been observed as a

Gastrointestinal perforations
Evidence for linking the risk to

The important risk was defined based on in-depth review of the literature on 
IL-6, review and analysis of clinical safety data observed with sarilumab during 
the clinical development program. Gastrointestinal perforations were primarily 
reported as complications of diverticulitis, including lower GI perforation and 
abscess and were generally confounded by the use of concomitant steroids or 
NSAIDs. 
Risk factors and risk groups  
Age, history of diverticulitis, use of glucocorticoids, and/or prescription NSAIDs, 
concomitant NSAID or steroid use.a

The important risk was defined based on in-depth review of the literature on

the clinical development program. Sarilumab administration was associated 
with laboratory abnormality of decreased platelet count, consistent with its 
mechanism of action. 
Thrombocytopenia and potential risk of bleeding
Risk factors and risk groups  
Rarely does bleeding occur in patients with platelet counts >50 Giga/L. 
Purpura may occur in patients with platelet counts between 30-50 Giga/L.

Lipid abnormalities and increased risk of major cardiovascular events
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine  
The important risk was defined based on in-depth review of the literature on 
IL-6, review and analysis of clinical safety data observed with sarilumab 
during the clinical development program. Sarilumab administration was 
associated with laboratory abnormalities of increased lipids, consistent with 
its mechanism of action and may increase the risk of MACE.  
Risk factors and risk groups  
Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with increased CV morbidity and 
mortality, related not only to traditional CV risk factors (eg, age, gender, 
Lipid abnormalities and increased risk of major cardiovascular events

diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension), but also to a chronic 
inflammatory state.a The results in a publication from a randomized, 
parallel-group, multicenter, non-inferiority, Phase 4 clinical trial to assess CV 
safety of TCZ (IL-6 inhibitor) were compared with etanercept in RA, showed 
that 83 MACE occurred over 4900 PYs in the TCZ arm versus 78 over 
4891 PYs in the etanercept arm (HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.77, 1.43). b

Malignancy
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine  
The important risk was defined based on in-depth review of the literature on 
IL-6, review and analysis of non-clinical findings, as well as of clinical safety 
data observed with sarilumab during the clinical development program. Due to 
the immunomodulatory effects of biologic DMARDs used in the treatment of 
RA, treatment may result in an increased risk of malignancies. Since a higher 
rate of malignancy was not observed in patients treated with sarilumab 
compared to the general population or patients with RA, this is considered an 
important potential risk.  
Risk factors and risk groups  
Age, duration/severity of RA and other risk factors based on type (eg, smoking 
history, family history).

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for japanese encephalitis virus 
(inactivated), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
After review of available periodic and cumulative information on syncope including convulsive syncope, 
the PRAC noted that most of the reports of vaccination induced seizures, in particular where syncope 
was explicitly reported or where onset was temporally close to vaccination, seemed to belong to the 
category of ‘convulsive syncope’ with causation being mostly related to vasovagal mechanisms 
suggesting that they may have been administration related. Therefore, the PRAC is recommending an 
update to the SmPC section 4.8 to add the term ‘syncope’ with the frequency rare. The Package leaflet 
is being updated accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for japanese encephalitis virus (inactivated) the CHMP is of 
the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing japanese encephalitis 
virus (inactivated) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

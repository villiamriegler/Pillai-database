4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Co-administration of other medicinal products 
Co-administration of repaglinide and tecovirimat may cause mild to moderate hypoglycaemia, (see 
section 4.5).  Blood glucose and hypoglycaemic symptoms should be monitored when administering 
tecovirimat with repaglinide. 
Co-administration of midazolam and tecovirimat may reduce the effectiveness of midazolam (see 
section 4.5).  Effectiveness of midazolam should be monitored when administering tecovirimat with 
midazolam. 
Renal impairment 
Tecovirimat should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment as there is limited 
clinical data in this population and higher unbound drug and metabolites levels may be observed.  
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Tecovirimat should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment as there is limited 
clinical data in this population and higher unbound drug and metabolite levels may be observed (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Immunocompromised population 
The safety and efficacy of tecovirimat has not been evaluated in immunocompromised individuals.  
Nonclinical studies using animal models indicate that tecovirimat may have reduced efficacy in 
immunocompromised individuals.  (See section 5.1). 
Excipients  
This medicine contains lactose.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
This medicine contains sunset yellow (E110).  May cause allergic reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on tecovirimat  
Tecovirimat is a substrate of UGT1A1, 1A3 and 1A4.  Co-administration of tecovirimat with strong 
inhibitors or inducers of these UGTs is not expected to have a clinically important effect on 
tecovirimat exposures.  
Effect of tecovirimat on other medicinal products 
Tecovirimat and its M4 metabolite are inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A and CYP2B6.  
Co-administration with tecovirimat may lead to reduced plasma exposures of sensitive substrates of 
CYP3A4 or CYP2B6, potentially leading to reduced effects.  Monitoring is advised during 
co-administration of tecovirimat with CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates that have narrow therapeutic 
windows.  See Table 2 for some examples. 
Tecovirimat is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19.  Co-administration with tecovirimat may 
lead to increased plasma exposures of sensitive substrates of CYP2C8 or CYP2C19, potentially 
leading to increased adverse effects.  Monitoring is advised during co-administration of tecovirimat

4.6  Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of tecovirimat in pregnant women. 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Tecovirimat is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether tecovirimat/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available toxicological/safety data in animals have shown excretion of tecovirimat in milk 
(see section 5.3). 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with tecovirimat. 
Fertility 
The effects of tecovirimat on fertility in humans have not been studied.  
Tecovirimat caused decreased fertility due to testicular toxicity in male mice (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to Drive and use Machines 
Tecovirimat has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Patients should be informed 
about the possible occurrence of dizziness and should be cautoned about driving or operating 
machines until they know how tecovirimat will affect them.  
4.8  Undesirable Effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were headache (12.3%) and nausea (4.5%).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic Properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Antiviral for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX24. 
Mechanism of action 
Tecovirimat inhibits the activity of the orthopoxvirus VP37 protein, which is encoded by a highly 
conserved gene in all members of the orthopoxvirus genus.  Tecovirimat blocks the interaction of 
VP37 with cellular Rab9 GTPase and TIP47, which prevents the formation of egress competent 
enveloped virions necessary for cell-to-cell and long-range dissemination of virus. 
Activity in cell culture 
In cell culture assays, the effective concentrations of tecovirimat resulting in a 50% reduction in virus 
induced cytopathic effect (EC50), were 0.016-0.067 μM, 0.014-0.039 µM, 0.015 µM and 0.009 µM, for 
smallpox, mpox, rabbitpox and vaccinia viruses, respectively.   
Resistance 
There are no known instances of naturally occurring tecovirimat-resistant orthopoxviruses, although 
tecovirimat resistance may develop under drug selection.  Tecovirimat has a relatively low resistance 
barrier, and certain amino acid substitutions in the target VP37 protein can confer large reductions in 
tecovirimat antiviral activity.  The possibility of resistance to tecovirimat should be considered in 
patients either who fail to respond to therapy or who develop recrudescence of disease after an initial 
period of responsiveness. 
Nonclinical efficacy  
Efficacy studies were conducted in cynomolgus macaques infected with mpox virus and New Zealand 
White (NZW) rabbits infected with rabbitpox virus.  The primary efficacy endpoint for these studies 
was survival.  In non-human primate studies, cynomolgus macaques were lethally challenged 
intravenously with 5 x 107 plaque-forming units of mpox virus.  Tecovirimat was administered orally 
once daily at a dose level of 10 mg/kg for 14 days, starting at Day 4, 5 or 6 post-challenge.  In rabbit 
studies, NZW rabbits were lethally challenged intradermally with 1,000 plaque-forming units of 
rabbitpox virus.  Tecovirimat was administered orally once daily for 14 days at a dose level of 
40 mg/kg, starting at Day 4 post-challenge.  The timing of tecovirimat dosing in these studies was 
intended to assess efficacy when treatment is initiated after animals have developed clinical signs of 
disease, specifically dermal pox lesions in cynomolgus macaques and fever in rabbits.  Clinical signs 
of disease were evident in some animals at Day 2-3 post-challenge but were evident in all animals by 
Day 4 post-challenge.  Survival was monitored for 3-6 times the mean time to death for untreated 
animals in each model.

Treatment with tecovirimat for 14 days resulted in statistically significant improvement in survival 
relative to placebo, except when given to cynomolgus macaques starting at Day 6 post-challenge 
(Table 4).

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
The non-human primate (NHP) and rabbit PK/PD models were developed in order to establish the 
exposure-response relationship between tecovirimat treatment and survival.  The dose and regimen for 
humans were subsequently selected to provide exposures that exceed those associated with the fully 
effective dose in animals.  Analysis of PK/PD models indicates that Cmin and AUC are the most 
predictive PK parameters for drug efficacy. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
tecovirimat in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of orthopoxvirus 
disease (smallpox, mpox, cowpox and vaccinia) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
This medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’.  This means that for 
ethical reasons it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.  
The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic Properties 
Absorption 
Tecovirimat reaches maximum plasma concentrations 4 to 6 hours after oral administration with food. 
The administration of tecovirimat with a meal of moderate fat and calories (~ 600 calories and 
~ 25 grams of fat), as compared to tecovirimat taken in the fasted (unfed) state, increased the drug 
exposure (AUC) by 39%.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Tecovirimat is 77.3-82.2% bound to human plasma proteins.  After a single 600 mg dose of 
[14C]-tecovirimat in healthy subjects, concentrations of total radioactivity were lower in whole blood 
compared to plasma at all time points, with ratios of whole blood to plasma ranging from 0.62-0.90 
across all time points.  Tecovirimat has a high volume of distribution (1356 L). 
Biotransformation 
Based on human studies, tecovirimat is metabolized to form metabolites M4 (N-{3,5-dioxo-4- 
azatetracyclo[5.3.2.0{2,6}.0{8,10}]dodec-11-en-4-yl}amine), M5 (3,5-dioxo-4- 
aminotetracyclo[5.3.2.0{2,6}.0{8,10}]dodec-11-ene), and TFMBA (4 (trifluoromethyl) benzoic acid). 
None of the metabolites is pharmacologically active.   
Tecovirimat is a substrate of UGT1A1 and UGT1A4.  In urine, primary tecovirimat glucuronide 
conjugate and M4 glucuronide conjugate were the most abundant components accounting for means of 
24.4% and 30.3% of dose, respectively.  However, none of the glucuronide conjugates was found as a 
major metabolite in plasma. 
Elimination 
After a single dose of [14C]-tecovirimat in healthy subjects, approximately 95% of the 
[14C]-radioactivity was recovered in urine and faeces over the 192-hour post-dose period, with 
approximately 73% of the [14C]-radioactivity administered being recovered in urine and 23% being 
recovered in faeces, indicating that the renal pathway is the major route of excretion.  The renal 
excretion of parent compound was minimal, accounting for less than 0.02%.  The majority of drug 
excreted by the renal system is in a glucuronidated form.  In faeces, the excretion was mainly of 
unchanged tecovirimat. The terminal half-life of tecovirimat was 19.3 hr. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Tecovirimat exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 100-600 mg. 
Special populations 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tecovirimat were observed in healthy 
subjects based on age, gender or race. 
Renal impairment 
In subjects with renal impairment (based on estimated GFR), no clinically significant differences in 
the pharmacokinetics of tecovirimat were observed.   
Hepatic impairment 
In subjects with with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (based on Child Pugh Scores A, 
B or C), no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tecovirimat were observed.  
However, it is possible that patients with severe hepatic impairment may have higher unbound drug 
and metabolite levels (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Paediatric patients 
The pharmacokinetics of tecovirimat has not been evaluated in paediatric patients.  The recommended 
paediatric dosing regimen for subjects at least 13 kg body weight is expected to produce tecovirimat 
exposures that are comparable to those in adult subjects aged 18 to 50 years based on a population 
pharmacokinetic modeling and a simulation approach. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered in excess of the maximum 
human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
The non-clinical safety was evaluated in 28-day and 3-month studies in mice and monkeys, 
respectively.  Cmax exposures at the no observed adverse effect level in the toxicology studies 
compared to the human Cmax at the recommended human dose (RHD) have safety margins of 23 based 
on the mouse and 2.5 based on the monkey.  The dog is a more sensitive species to tecovirimat and 
was tested after a single dose or repeated doses.  Six hours after a single dose of 300 mg/kg, one dog 
experienced convulsions (tonic and clonic) with electroencephalography (EEG) consistent with seizure 
activity.  This dose produce a Cmax in the dog that was approximately 4 times higher than the highest 
human Cmax at the RHD.  In the dog, the no observe adverse effect level was determined to be 
30 mg/kg with a Cmax safety margin at the RHD of 1. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with tecovirimat. 
Tecovirimat was not genotoxic in in vitro or in vivo assays. 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in mice, no effects of tecovirimat on female 
fertility were observed at tecovirimat exposures (AUC) approximately 24 times higher than human 
exposure at the RHD.  In a fertility and early embryonic development study in mice, no biologically 
meaningful effects of tecovirimat on male or female fertility were observed at tecovirimat exposures 
(AUC) approximately 24 times higher than human exposure at the RHD. 
Reproductive toxicity studies have been performed in mice and rabbits.  Based on pilot studies, the 
highest dose selected for the definitive study in rabbit was 100 mg/kg and in mice was 1,000 mg/kg.  
No embryo-foetal toxicities were observed in rabbit at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (0.4 times the 
human exposure at the RHD) and no embryo-foetal toxicities were observed at doses up to 
1,000 mg/kg/day in mice (approximately 23 times higher than human exposure at the RHD). 
No embryo-foetal toxicities were observed at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits (0.4 times the 
human exposure at the RHD).  Maternal toxicity was detected in rabbits at 100 mg/kg/day, which 
included decreases in body weight and mortality.

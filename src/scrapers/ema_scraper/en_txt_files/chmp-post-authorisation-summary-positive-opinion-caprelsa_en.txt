On 10 November 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Caprelsa. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Genzyme Europe BV. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2: 
“Caprelsa is indicated for the treatment of aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid cancer 
(MTC) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. 
Caprelsa is indicated in adults, children and adolescents aged 5 years and older. 
For patients in whom Rearranged during Transfection (RET) mutation is not known or is negative, 
a possible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision”. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

days from adoption of the opinion

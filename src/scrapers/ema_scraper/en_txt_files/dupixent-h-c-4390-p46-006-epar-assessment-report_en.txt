The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study number: LPS15991 
Study title: Open label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function 
in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis - Dupilumab skin BArrier function and LIpidomics

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
LPS15991/BALISTAD: Open-label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on 
skin barrier function in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis 
Description 
The scope of this phase 4 study was the analysis of the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin-barrier 
function in adolescent and adult atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, i.e. on pathophysiological features 
such as epidermal activation, epidermal lipids and proteins, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) etc. 
using skin tape stripping (STS) to measure skin barrier function and integrity. In addition, disease 
activity was measured by clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes, as well as high-
definition standard photography from the targeted lesional and non-lesional areas.

Methods 
Study participants 
Male or female adolescent or adult (aged 12 to 65 years) patients with moderate to severe AD 
according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria at least 1 year before screening and IGA score of ≥3 at 
screening and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteer participants were enrolled in this study. 
Patients must have had non-lesional skin 4 cm from the lesional area or at least identifiable normal 
looking skin as close to the lesion as possible. They were treatment-naïve or had paused dupilumab 
treatment for at least 6 months before study entry. The application of topical medications and 
moisturizers on the target assessment areas should be withheld if possible throughout the study. 
CHMP comment 
A total of 52 study participants were enrolled and assigned 1:1 either to the healthy 
volunteer or to the dupilumab cohort based on their health condition. Overall, 12 
adolescent patients were enrolled, 6 thereof had an AD diagnosis of several years and 
thus, were treated with dupilumab. All dupilumab-treated patients completed the 
study, whereas 3 of the HV cohort prematurely discontinued the study; their age is 
unclear. The inclusion criteria were adequately chosen to define an AD population.  
Study design 
This was a phase 4 open-label, exploratory study evaluating the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier 
function in adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe AD with a healthy volunteer cohort 
as a reference comparator in two study sites (see Fig.1). 
The maximum study duration per participant was 24 weeks. The study comprised of: 
• Screening Period 1 (Day -28 to -1): Subjects were evaluated according to inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. 
• Baseline Visit (Day 1): Subjects who remained eligible were enrolled. 
• 16-week treatment period for AD patients and a 16-week observation period for healthy volunteers. 
• 4-week safety follow-up period.

CHMP comment 
A healthy volunteer cohort served as reference comparator for the AD population. To 
establish similar conditions for the subsequent analysis of dupilumab’s treatment effect 
on the skin barrier, individuals were matched with AD patients for age, gender, 
examined skin area and study site.  
Treatments 
The study intervention included dupilumab 200 mg and 300 mg in a prefilled syringe for subcutaneous 
administration.  
For AD patients aged ≥12 to <18 years, the dose regimen was based on body weight on Day 1: 
• Loading dose of 400 mg on Day 1, followed by 200 mg Q2W for a body weight of less than 60 kg. 
• Loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1, followed by 300 mg Q2W for a body weight of ≥ 60 kg. 
CHMP comment 
Dupilumab was administered to AD patients according to the authorized posology. 
Study subjects must have had a treatment gap of at least 6 months or must have 
been treatment-naïve. This is reasonable with regard to the comparability of the 
differently affected skin areas.

Objective(s) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary and secondary study objectives and endpoints are listed in Table 1 below.

CHMP comment 
The measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) to quantify the skin barrier 
functionality as well as non-invasive techniques such as skin tape stripping to 
determine TEWL are commonly used in clinical trials. Here, 5-20 STS over a period of 
16 weeks were performed in lesional and non-lesional skin areas in AD patients under 
dupilumab treatment and for comparison in HV. The STS time points are acceptable as 
dupilumab’s treatment effect sets in after 2 weeks. 
Sample size 
A total of 52 participants were enrolled in the study, of which 26 participants each were enrolled in the 
dupilumab cohort and the healthy volunteer cohort.  
The intent-to-treat (ITT) and safety populations included 52 participants. The modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT) population included 51 participants because 1 healthy volunteer participant was retrospectively 
found to not meet the inclusion criteria and hence was excluded from the mITT population. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Changes to the conduct of the study 
• To further characterize the treatment effect of dupilumab in adolescent and adult patients with 
moderate to severe AD in reference to matched healthy controls, a proteomics assessment and a 
transcriptomics assessment from skin tape strips were added. 
• These assessments allowed for better assessment of the mechanism of dupilumab in AD. To have 
comparable data in lesional skin and non-lesional skin of AD patients as well as in normal skin of 
healthy volunteers, the number of skin tape strips collected was set to 20 for each skin area. 
• In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, benefit-risk assessment in the context of COVID-19 
was introduced in Amended Protocol 01. Implementation of temporary or alternative mechanisms such 
as phone contact, virtual visits, online meetings, use of local clinic or laboratory locations, and home 
visits by skilled staff (as permitted per local regulations) were allowed to ensure the study continuity 
and protect participants’ safety. No waivers to deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to 
COVID‑19 were granted. Remote monitoring was implemented when onsite monitoring was not 
allowed. All temporary mechanisms utilized and deviations from planned study procedures were 
documented as being related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
CHMP comment 
The amendments are not supposed to have negatively affected the effiacacy or safety 
analyses. 
Evaluation of dupilumab’s treatment effect on skin proteomics and on skin 
transcriptome (expression of proteins or genes associated with skin barrier function) 
using STS samples were explored as tertiary endpoints. According to the MAH, results 
will be provided in a separate report.

Statistical Methods 
No hypothesis testing is predefined in this exploratory study. 
Sample size for this exploratory study was based on medical/clinical judgement and aligned with the 
sample size from similar studies in the literature. No formal sample size calculation was performed. 
TEWL data collected in similar settings as planned for this study were not available: ie, TEWL values 
after 5 skin tape strips, and pre- and post-dupilumab treatment are unknown. 
Allowing for drop-out rate of 15%, a total of approximately 24 patients with moderate to severe 
AD will be enrolled to achieve 20 evaluable patients: ie, patients with no major or critical 
deviations related to IMP and/or TEWL measurements, for whom the TEWL data for primary 
analysis: ie, TEWL at baseline and Week16, are considered sufficient and interpretable. An 
approximately equal number of age, gender, location of targeted lesion area and site matched 
healthy volunteers serving as a reference comparator cohort will be enrolled. Drop-out rate in 
healthy volunteers is expected to be zero. Any drop-out healthy volunteer for whom the matched 
patient is considered as evaluable will not be replaced. 
A detailed description of participant accountability including number of participants by analysis 
population, screen failure of participants with the reasons for screen failure, participants who did 
not complete the study observation period along with the main reason for permanent treatment 
discontinuation, and participants who requested permanent treatment discontinuation was generated 
by cohort. 
Continuous variables (age, weight) and qualitative variables (gender, race, and body mass index) were 
summarized by cohort in descriptive statistics (summary tables).  
The efficacy evaluation was based on a review of the individual values (graphics), descriptive statistics 
(summary tables, graphics), and where applicable, exploratory statistical analysis.  
The safety evaluation was based on a review of vital signs parameters and reported adverse events 
(AEs). All the safety analyses were performed using the safety population. When applicable, results 
were reported by cohort and overall. 
Results 
Participant flow 
All 26 participants in the dupilumab cohort completed the study treatment period as well as the study 
period, whereas 3 healthy volunteer participants did not complete the study. The reasons for 
permanent study discontinuation included participant lost to follow-up, withdrawal by participant, and 
failure to meet inclusion criteria (see Table 5).

A total of 19 major protocol deviations were reported during the study. Major protocol deviations that 
impacted efficacy analyses were as follows: 
• 
Two participants from the dupilumab cohort received topical corticosteroids as rescue 
medications for worsening of AD during the treatment period.  
•  One participant from the dupilumab cohort received systemic corticosteroid for the treatment 
of medical history (left hip bursitis).  
•  One participant from the dupilumab cohort received IMP not as per protocol during the 
treatment period.  
•  One healthy volunteer participant and 1 participant from the dupilumab cohort received topical 
antibiotics as for the treatment of AEs.  
•  One healthy volunteer participant who was retrospectively identified as not meeting the 
eligibility criteria after enrollment, received topical corticosteroid for treatment of an AE 
(worsening of dermatitis shoulder and arm). 
CHMP comment 
All patients assigned to the dupilumab group completed the study. 4/26 (15.4%) thereof had 
major protocol deviations that are supposed to have influenced the efficacy analysis mainly 
due to oral intake or topical application of corticosteroids. Based on the provided documents it 
is, however, unclear if paediatric patients were involved. 
Recruitment 
LPS15991 was conducted from 16 July 2020 (first patient first visit) through 17 June 2021 (last patient 
last visit), in 2 centers in the United States and in Canada.

In adult participants, the median age at baseline was 40.5 years, and ranged from 18 to 63 years. The 
majority of participants (60.0%) were male. A majority of the participants (28 [70.0%] participants) 
had body mass index <30 kg/m2. In adolescent participants, the median age at baseline was 13.5 
years, and ranged from 12 to 17 years. The number of male and female participants was the same (6 
[50.0%] participants each). The majority of participants (10 [83.3%] participants) had body mass 
index <30 kg/m2 (see Table 8). 
Baseline disease characteristics 
In the dupilumab cohort, the median (range) duration since diagnosis of AD was 13.2 (4 to 16) years 
for adolescent participants and 26.0 (4 to 56) years for adult participants in the mITT population (mITT 
population was same as the safety population for the dupilumab cohort), see Table 9.

Prior and concomitant medications 
A notably higher number of participants reported prior medications clinically relevant to AD in 
the dupilumab cohort compared with that in the healthy volunteers cohort, respectively, including 
corticosteroids, dermatological preparations (25 [96.2%] participants versus 0 participants), 
antipruritics, including antihistamines, anesthetics, etc (19 [73.1%] participants versus 1 [3.8%] 
participant), corticosteroids for systemic use (18 [69.2%] participants versus 0 participants), 
psycholeptics (14 [53.8%] participants versus 2 [7.7%] participants), antibacterials for systemic 
use (6 [23.1%] participants versus 1 [3.8%] participant), antipsoriatics (5 [19.2%] participants 
versus 0 participants), and antibiotics and chemotherapeutics for dermatological use and 
immunosuppressants (4 [15.4%] participants versus 0 participants each). 
A notably higher number of participants also reported clinically important prior medications in the 
dupilumab cohort compared with that in the healthy volunteers cohort, respectively, including 
ophthalmologicals (23 [88.5%] participants versus 5 [19.2%] participants), drugs for obstructive 
airway diseases (23 [88.5%] participants versus 0 participants), and nasal preparations 
(20 [76.9%] participants versus 1 [3.8%] participant). 
A total of 9 (34.6%) participants in the dupilumab cohort were reported to have received 
concomitant corticosteroids, dermatological preparations, of which 3 participants received those 
medications via topical route, and the rest of the participants received the medications via other 
routes. Of the 2 (7.7%) participants in the dupilumab cohort who received concomitant antibiotics and 
chemotherapeutics for dermatological use via topical route, both participants received the 
medications for the treatment of AEs (treatment of abscess and of minor wound). 
Of the 2 (7.7%) participants in the dupilumab cohort who received concomitant corticosteroids for 
systemic use, left hip bursitis and worsening of bilateral shoulder pain). 
CHMP comment 
Regarding the adolescents, the gender ratio was balanced across both cohorts, 
whereas race and ethnicity was not. All patients of the dupilumab group had a history 
of chronic AD (median 13.2 years) and corresponding prior medication. The majority of 
patients included in the safety population received concomitant medications (26/26 in 
the dupilumab and 24/26 of the HV), i.e. emollients and antipruritics etc. 
13/26 patients assigned to the dupilumab cohort received prohibited medications and 
11/26 (34.6%) thereof were reported to have received concomitant corticosteroids 
(topical or systemic) und thus, prohibited medication, however, only 2 were assessed 
to have caused protocol violations related to administration of prohibited medications. 
It is unclear if adolescent patients were involved. 
To what extent these medications have influenced TEWL measurement, was not 
discussed by the MAH. 
Number analysed 
All 52 participants were included in the ITT and the safety populations. The mITT population included 
51 participants (1 participant was retrospectively found to not meet the inclusion criteria and hence

population is provided in Table 6. 
Efficacy results 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Percent change from baseline in TEWL at Week 16 after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin  
The Percent change from baseline in TEWL after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin at Week 16 in AD 
patients in the mITT population was -54.6 (18.0) (Table 15). The primary statistical analysis of ratio of 
the Week 16 and baseline TEWL values after 5 STS on lesional skin in AD patients for the mITT 
population demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement (point 
estimate [90% CI] = 0.43 [0.37 to 0.49], p<0.0001), representing a 57% reduction in TEWL (Table 
16).

statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement on lesional skin (ratio of the Week 16 
and baseline TEWL values: before STS: point estimate [90% CI] = 0.49 [0.43 to 0.55], p<0.0001; 
after 10 STS: point estimate [90% CI] = 0.43 [0.37 to 0.50], p<0.0001; after 15 STS: point estimate 
[90% CI] = 0.48 [0.39 to 0.59], p<0.0001; after 20 STS: point estimate [90% CI] = 0.51 [0.41 to

CHMP comment 
The primary efficacy endpoint Percent change from baseline in TEWL at Week 16 after 
5 STS assessed on lesional skin for the whole mITT population was met, i.e. TEWL was 
reduced by 57% under dupilumab treatment. This effect was consistent over time as 
reflected by the outcome of the secondary endpoints. 
Tertiary/exploratory endpoints 
The results of the tertiary endpoints related to lipidomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and gene 
expression will be provided in a separate report. The tertiary endpoints of the mean absolute and 
percent change from baseline in EASI, SCORAD, GISS, peak pruritus NRS, POEM, quality of sleep NRS, 
and DLQI scores indicated a gradual improvement in symptoms over time. 
Safety results 
Exposure 
The mean (SD) exposure was 111.8 (2.9) days (Table 13). All participants in the dupilumab cohort 
were treated for more than 99 days. 
Adverse events 
Overall, 20 (76.9%) participants in the dupilumab cohort experienced TEAEs. The details of adult 
and adolescent participants with TEAEs are included in Table 33. 
A total of 13 (50.0%) participants in the healthy volunteers cohort experienced AEs, all of which 
(13 [65.0%] participants) were adults (Table 34).

Overall, 20 (76.9%) participants in the dupilumab cohort experienced treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs). Six out of the 6 adolescents (100%) in dupilumab cohort presented with TEAEs. 
The TEAE preferred terms (PTs) reported in the 6 adolescents in dupilumab cohort were as follows: 
• Food allergy: 2 (33.3%) 
• Injection site reaction: 2 (33.3%) 
• Conjunctivitis allergic: 1 (16.7%) 
• Abscess limb: 1 (16.7%) 
• Hordeolum: 1 (16.7%) 
• Arthralgia: 1 (16.7%) 
• Dermatitis atopic: 1 (16.7%). 
A total of 13 (50.0%) participants in the healthy volunteer cohort experienced AEs, all of which (13 
[65.0%] participants) were adults. There were no AEs reported in the 6 adolescents who were from the 
healthy volunteer cohort. 
In the dupilumab cohort, the most common TEAE PTs (≥10% participants overall) reported were 
injection site reaction (5 [19.2%] participants) and arthralgia (3 [11.5%] participants). 
In addition, in the dupilumab cohort, 2 (10.0%) adult participants reported noninfective conjunctivitis 
and 1 (16.7%) adolescent participant reported allergic conjunctivitis. In the healthy volunteer cohort, 
the most common AE PT (≥10% participants overall) reported was ecchymosis (3 [11.5%] 
participants). None of the participants in either of the cohorts experienced a severe AE, a serious 
adverse event (SAE), an AE leading to death, an AE leading to permanent study intervention 
discontinuation, or an adverse event of special interest (AESI). 
In the dupilumab cohort, 1 adult participant experienced a potentially clinically significant abnormality 
(PCSA) of ≥5% decrease in weight from baseline and 5 adult participants experienced a PCSA of ≥5% 
increase in weight from baseline; 
In the healthy volunteer cohort, 1 adult participant each experienced PCSAs of diastolic blood pressure 
≥90 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥10 mmHg, ≥5% decrease in weight from baseline, and ≥5% 
increase in weight from baseline.  
One adolescent participant in the dupilumab cohort experienced PCSAs of diastolic blood pressure ≤54 
mmHg and decrease from baseline ≥10 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≥78 mmHg and increase 
from baseline ≥10 mmHg. 
One adolescent participant in the healthy volunteer cohort experienced a PCSA of diastolic blood 
pressure ≥78 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥10 mmHg. 
CHMP comment 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were collected over 20 weeks. All 
patients in the dupilumab cohort had a mean exposure of 112 days. 6/6 (100%) of 
the included paediatric patients had TEAEs, however, no serious AE, AE of special 
interest or deaths were reported. Regarding the TEAE preferred terms (PTs) reported 
in the 6 adolescents, typical adverse events was observed that are known to occur 
under dupilumab treatment in the AD population, i.e. local injection reactions and 
eye complications prevailed. However, considering the very limited number of 
patients, the TEAE frequencies are of limited informative value. No AEs were 
observed in adolescents assigned to the healthy volunteer cohort.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Atopic dermatitis is associated with skin barrier defects, which has, amongst others, implications for 
the immune function of the skin. The scope of this phase 4 study was the analysis of the effect of 
dupilumab treatment on skin-barrier function in adolescent and adult AD patients, i.e. on 
pathophysiological features such as TEWL, epidermal activation, epidermal lipids and proteins, etc. 
using STS to measure skin barrier function and integrity. In addition, disease activity was measured by 
clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes, as well as high-definition standard photography 
from the targeted lesional and non-lesional areas.  
Methodology 
A total of 52 study participants were enrolled and assigned 1:1 either to the healthy volunteer or to the 
dupilumab cohort based on their health condition. Overall, 12 adolescent patients were enrolled, 6 
thereof had an AD diagnosis of many years and thus, were treated with dupilumab. All 6 dupilumab-
treated patients completed the study, whereas 3 of the HV cohort prematurely discontinued the study; 
their age is unclear. Overall, the inclusion criteria were adequately chosen to define an AD population.  
A healthy volunteer cohort served as reference comparator for the AD population. To establish similar 
conditions for the subsequent analysis of dupilumab’s treatment effect on the skin barrier, individuals 
were matched with AD patients for age, gender, examined skin area and study site.  
Dupilumab was administered to AD patients according to the authorized posology. Study subjects must 
have had a treatment gap of at least 6 months or must have been treatment-naïve. This is reasonable 
with regard to the comparability of the differently affected skin areas. 
The measurement of TEWL to quantify the skin barrier functionality as well as non-invasive techniques 
such as STS to determine TEWL are commonly used in clinical trials. Here, 5-20 STS over a period of 
16 weeks were performed in lesional and non-lesional skin areas in AD patients under dupilumab 
treatment and for comparison in HV. The STS time points are acceptable as the onset of dupilumab’s 
effect was observed after 2 treatment weeks in clinical trials. 
All patients assigned to the dupilumab group completed the study. 4/26 (15.4%) thereof had major 
protocol deviations that might have influenced the efficacy analysis mainly due to oral intake or topical 
application of corticosteroids. Based on the provided documents it is, however, unclear if paediatric 
patients were involved. The introduced protocol amendments are not supposed to have negatively 
affected the effiacacy or safety analyses. 
Results  
Regarding the adolescents, the gender ratio was balanced across both cohorts, whereas the race and 
ethnicity ratio were unbalanced. All patients of the dupilumab group had a history of chronic AD 
(median 13.2 years) and corresponding prior medication. The majority of patients included in the 
safety population received concomitant medications (26/26 in the dupilumab and 24/26 of the HV), i.e. 
emollients and antipruritics etc. 
13/26 patients assigned to the dupilumab cohort received prohibited medications and 11/26 (34.6%) 
thereof were reported to have received concomitant corticosteroids (topical or systemic) und thus, 
prohibited medication. However, only 2 were assessed to have caused protocol violations related to 
administration of prohibited medications. It is unclear if adolescent patients were involved. 
To what extent these medications have influenced TEWL measurement, is not discussed by the MAH. 
The primary efficacy endpoint Percent change from baseline in TEWL at Week 16 after 5 STS assessed 
on lesional skin for the whole mITT population was met, i.e. TEWL was reduced by 57% under 
dupilumab treatment. This effect was consistent over time as reflected by the outcome of the 
secondary and tertiary endpoints.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Few adolescent patients AD were included in this phase 4 study that aimed at the analysis of 
dupilumab’s treatment effect on skin-barrier function. The efficacy results indicate that TEWL of 
lesional skin was gradually reduced for the total AD mITT population over a period of 16 treatment 
weeks compared with the TEWL of healthy volunteers suggesting an improved skin barrier. However, 
the relatively high amount of concomitant AD medication might have influenced the results. Regarding 
the very limited analysed patient number of overall 12 adolescents, the generated data are considered 
supportive information. The collected safety data are consistent with the known safety profile. It is 
concurred that no amendment of the PI is indicated.

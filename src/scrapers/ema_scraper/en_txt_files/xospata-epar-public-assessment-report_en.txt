1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Astellas Pharma Europe B.V. submitted on 7 February 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for XOSPATA, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 28 February 2019. 
XOSPATA  was  designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  EU/3/17/1961  on  17  January  2018  in  the 
following condition: treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Xospata  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  who  have  relapsed  or  refractory  (R/R)  acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) with a FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Xospata as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website:

New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance gilteritinib contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Protocol assistance 
The applicant received Scientific Advice/Protocol Assistance on the development relevant for the 
approved indication from the CHMP on 25 June 2015 (EMEA/H/SAH/043/1/2015/III), 14 September 
2017 (EMEA/H/SAH/043/1/FU/3/2017/II CORRIGENDUM), and 31 May 2018 
(EMEA/H/SA/3789/1/FU/4/2018/PA/II). The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality, non-
clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier: 
• 
The regulatory approach to the proposed definition of starting materials  
•  Completeness of the overall non-clinical programme 
•  Adequacy of the clinical pharmacology programme 
•  A randomised, open label, multicentre pivotal phase 3 study with salvage chemotherapy 
therapy as comparator: the dose regimens and approach to concomitant medications; the 
target population and eligibility criteria; the method for identification and selection of FLT3-
mutation positive patients; the overall study design to serve as a single pivotal study for 
Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA); the statistical approach; the suitability of the 
Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments and their measurement; the adequacy of 
proposed interim analyses of composite complete remission rates (complete remission 
(CR)/complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp)/complete remission with

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Xospata is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory 
(R/R) acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Acute  myeloid  leukaemia  (AML)  accounts  for  approximately  80%  of  acute  leukaemias  diagnosed  in 
adults. It has been estimated that 19,950  people were diagnosed with AML in the US,  with a similar 
incidence in the EU. 
Approximately 30% of adult AML patients are refractory to induction therapy. Furthermore, of those who 
achieve  CR,  approximately  75%  will  relapse.  The,  5-year  survival  after  first  relapse  is  approximately 
10% (1). Patients who are in second relapse or are refractory to first salvage have an extremely poor 
prognosis, with survival measured in weeks. 
In  general,  the  incidence  of  AML  increases  with  advancing  age,  with  a  median  age  of  66  years. 
Environmental  factors  that  have  long  been  established  to  increase  the  risks  of  Myelodysplastic 
Syndromes (MDS) and AML include prolonged exposure to petrochemicals; solvents such as benzene; 
pesticides and ionizing radiation.

2.1.3.  Biologic features 
AML is generally characterized by aberrant differentiation and proliferation of malignantly transformed 
myeloid progenitor cells but can be considered a heterogeneous disease state with  various molecular 
and genetic aetiologies that result in variable clinical outcomes. When untreated or refractory to available 
treatments,  AML  results  in  the  accumulation  of  these  transformed  cells  within  the  bone  marrow, 
suppression  of  the  production  of  normal  blood  cells  (resulting  in  severe  neutropenia  and/or 
thrombocytopenia), as well as infiltration of these cells into other organs and tissues, and can be rapidly 
fatal. 
Sub-classifications of AML are commonly described using the World Health Organization (WHO) system, 
which establishes prognostic subgroups (good, intermediate, poor) based on cytogenetics and evidence 
of dysplasia. Among the molecular abnormalities, FLT3 mutations are the most common. Two of these 
mutations  are  well  described  in  the  literature:  an  ITD  in  the  juxtamembrane  domain  of  FLT3  that  is 
present in 28% to 34% of AML cases and a tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation at around D835 in 
the  activation  loop  of  FLT3,  which  is  present  in  11%  to  14%  of  AML  cases.  Each  of  these  activated 
mutations in FLT3 is oncogenic and shows transforming activity in cells. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Epidemiological and genetic data have shown that the majority of AML present more than one recurrent 
alteration,  including  point  mutations,  gene  rearrangements  and  chromosomal  translocations. 
Furthermore, it has been suggested that point mutations in transcription factors are sufficient to confer 
a proliferative and survival advantage to the leukemic clone. 
Certain genetic factors appear to predispose patients to poorer outcomes. Mutational status of FLT3, a 
member  of  the  class  III  receptor  tyrosine  kinase,  is  now  well  recognized  as  delineating  a  subtype  of 
leukaemia with poor prognosis, with a higher relapse rate, a shorter duration of remission from initial 
therapy (6 months vs 11.5 months for those without FLT3- internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations), 
as well as reduced disease-free survival (DFS) (16% to 27% vs 41% at 5 years) and overall survival 
(OS) (15% to 31% vs 42% at 5 years). 
Mutations within the FLT3 gene represent one of the most frequently identified genetic alterations that 
disturb intracellular signaling networks with a role in leukaemia pathogenesis. FLT3 is a member of the 
class  III  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  family  that  also  includes  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptor 
(PDGFR), macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (FMS) and stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT), 
with  which  it  shares  the  same  structure.  Activating  mutations  in  the  FLT3  gene,  including  ITDs  and 
missense point mutations in the TKD, are the molecular abnormalities most frequently observed in the 
blood cells of AML patients. These mutations lead to the overexpression or constitutive activation of the 
tyrosine kinase receptor. Many studies indicate that patients with FLT3 mutations have a worse prognosis 
than  patients  without  FLT3  alterations.  In  particular,  the  presence  of  an  FLT3-ITD  correlates  with  an 
increased risk of relapse and impaired OS. The effect on AML prognosis of the FLT3-TKD mutation has 
not yet been clearly defined; in several studies, the FLT3-TKD mutation did not seem to affect outcome 
while other investigations showed opposite results. In addition to cytogenetic abnormalities detected at 
diagnosis, which are the most important prognostic factor, FLT3 mutations are a significant independent 
prognostic factor that can influence outcome in terms of survival and duration of CR. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There is no universally accepted standard of care for patients with R/R AML  with FLT3 mutations and 
enrolment in a clinical trial should be prioritised whenever possible.  Possible salvage regimens are IDAC 
(intermediate  dose  cytarabine)  with  or  without  anthracycline,  MEC  (mitoxantrone;  etoposide; 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 11/126 
 
  
 
cytarabine) or FLAG-IDA (fludarabine; cytarabine; idarubicin; G-CSF). For unfit patients or patients not 
suitable for intensive chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents (azacytidine or decitabine frequently used 
in combination with sorafenib, in AML with FLT3-ITD mutation although sorafenib has not been approved 
for this indication) or low dose cytarabine (LoDAC) are possible alternatives. 
The choice of specific regimen is based on factors such as prior treatment, eligibility for allogeneic HSCT 
and  institutional  preference.  The  aim  of  treatment  is  to  achieve  remission  and  proceed  to  allogenic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) which offers the best chance of long-term relapse free 
survival. 
About the product 
Gilteritinib  inhibits  FLT3  receptor  signalling  and  proliferation  in  cells  exogenously  expressing  FLT3 
including  FLT3  ITD,  FLT3  D835Y,  and  FLT3  ITD  D835Y,  and  it  induced  apoptosis  in  leukaemic  cells 
expressing FLT3 ITD. 
In patients with relapsed or refractory AML receiving gilteritinib 120 mg, substantial (> 90%) inhibition 
of FLT3 phosphorylation was rapid (within 24 hours after first dose) and sustained, as characterised by 
an ex vivo plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay (SmPC, section 5.1). 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication:  
Xospata is indicated for the treatment of adult patients who have R/R AML with a FLT3 mutation. 
The final indications following CHMP review of this application is: 
Xospata is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation (sections 4.2 and 5.1).  
The recommended starting dose of Xospata is 120 mg gilteritinib (three 40 mg tablets) once daily (SmPC, 
section 4.2).  
Treatment  should  continue  until  the  patient  is  no  longer  clinically  benefiting  from  Xospata  or  until 
unacceptable  toxicity  occurs.  Response  may  be  delayed;  therefore,  continuation  of  treatment  at  the 
prescribed dose for up to 6 months should be considered to allow time for a clinical response. 
In the absence of a response (patient did not achieve a CRc) after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose can 
be increased to 200 mg (five 40 mg tablets) once daily, if tolerated or clinically warranted (SmPC, section 
4.2). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered 
to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that giltertinib had the potential to be 
effective in the R/R AML subpopulation with FLT-3 mutations. This subgroup of patients has a very poor 
prognosis and there are currently no approved standard treatments available in the EU.  Gilteritinib is 
an  inhibitor  of  the  FLT-3  tyrosin  kinase  receptor  and  based  on  the  biological  rationale  behind  this 
substance, it can potentially address the unmet medical need. The clinical efficacy data for gilteritinib 
based on the pivotal phase 3 study (demonstrating statistically and clinically meaningful effects on OS) 
seemed to support that gilteritinib can be an important new therapeutic treatment option.

SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of gilteritinib fumarate is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid;6-ethyl-3-[3-methoxy-4-[4-(4-
methylpiperazin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]anilino]-5-(oxan-4-ylamino)pyrazine-2-carboxamide corresponding 
to the molecular formula (C29H44N8O3)2 • C4H4O4. It has a relative molecular mass of 1221.50 g/mol 
and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of gilteritinib fumarate was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 
infrared absorption spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrophotometry. The solid state properties of the 
active substance were measured by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG). 
The active substance appears as yellow non-hygroscopic crystals. It is freely soluble in aqueous 
solution at pH 1-3, soluble at pH 5 and practically insoluble at pH 7 – 11. Gilteritinib fumarate has no 
optical isomers. Polymorphism has not been observed for the active substance. XPRD studies showed 
that gilteritinib fumarate is crystalline.  
It has been shown that the commercial drug substance synthesis method is designed to consistently 
deliver only one form of gilteritinib fumarate that showed no change during stability studies.

The Applicant has submitted full details of chemistry, manufacturing process, and quality controls of 
the active substance.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured in several convergent steps from 5 starting materials, followed 
by salt formation and crystallisation. The manufacturing is carried out by three manufacturers in total. 
An acceptable QP declaration, based on on-sites audit of all active substance manufacturers has been 
submitted.  
Overall, the manufacturing process contains eight processing steps including the salt formation and the 
active substance crystallisation step. Seven solid intermediates are isolated, characterized and 
controlled. Specifications and batch data have been provided for all isolated intermediates. The 
controls and proposed limits have been adequately discussed by the applicant.  
A detailed narrative description of each step, including quantities of starting materials, intermediates, 
reagents, catalysts and solvents as well as set points and ranges for all process parameters 
(temperatures, reaction times) and in-process controls have been provided.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The selection of regulatory starting materials was discussed in connection with a CHMP Scientific 
Advice in 2015. The definition of the starting materials is considered justified and acceptable in line 
with ICH Q11 principles. For all starting materials their chemical name, structural formula, names and 
full addresses of manufacturers, their synthetic routes and their specifications have been provided and 
justified. The carry-over of raw materials, impurities and solvents has been addressed.  
A control strategy based on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance has been 
developed. Risk assessment and risk control were performed to identify the CQAs, critical process 
parameters (CPPs), or critical in-process tests of the active substance. The CQAs are: assay, related 
substances, mutagenic impurities, residual solvents and elemental impurities. The medicine is intended 
for oral administration and bioburden is controlled by the active substance manufacturing process. No 
trends in microbial limit test have been seen in stability data. No crystal polymorphism has been 
observed. The particle size of the active substance is controlled as part of finished product 
manufacture. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. These included related substances, residual solvents and 
elemental impurities. The proposed control strategies for these impurities have been provided.  
The applicant was requested to perform a risk assessment for the gilteritinib fumarate manufacturing 
process in order to evaluate the risk of N-nitrosamines formation and contamination. These results 
indicate that there is no risk to residue on sodium nitrite/potassium nitrite and N-nitrosamines. 
Acceptable information and discussion regarding potential/actual impurities and the proposed control 
strategies for these impurities have been provided. The active substance gilteritinib fumarate is 
intended for advanced cancer therapy, and therefore it is outside the scope of ICH M7. Nevertheless, 
the applicant has described the strategy of the control of mutagenic impurities.  
The provided information on the manufacturing process development is considered acceptable. The 
development of each part of the manufacturing process is discussed in detail. Several manufacturing 
sites and scales have been employed in the manufacture of intermediates since the start of 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019

development; however, the changes of the sites and scales had no adverse effect on the quality of the 
drug substance.  
Changes made to the route of synthesis during development were described and justified. The quality 
of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be comparable 
with that produced by the proposed commercial process. Gilteritinib fumarate is packed in double 
polyethylene bags, closed by cable-ties and then packed in polyethylene tube, which is placed in a 
steel drum. The information provided regarding the active substance packaging materials is considered 
acceptable. The material is recognized as safe for use as a food contact material, in compliance with 
Commission Directive 2002/72/EC and Ph.Eur. 3.1.5 Polyethylene with additives for containers. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identification (UV-Vis, IR, fumaric acid 
by TLC), assay (HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water 
content (KF) and sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.). 
The specifications proposed for gilteritinib fumarate are acceptable. They have been established based 
on the requirements of the ICH guidelines Q3A, Q3C and Q6A and on the results from stability studies.  
A synthesis related impurity is controlled with a limit above the qualification threshold of ICH Q3A. The 
limit has been qualified by toxicological studies (see non-clinical section).  
Adequate justifications have been provided for the omission of heavy metals, physical form, microbial 
limit and particle size tests from the specification.  
Heavy metals were tested on development batches and the levels observed were always under the 
limit of detection. The safety assessment for the elemental impurities was also performed based on 
ICH Q3D (see finished product section). Based on the justification presented, the heavy metals test is 
not included in the proposed specification. 
A test for determination of physical form (polymorphs) is not included. Data from XRPD analyses 
indicated the presence of only one form of gilteritinib fumarate and showed no change in the 
polymorphic form during stability studies.  
An acceptance criterion for microbial limit test is not proposed for gilteritinib fumarate in line with ICH 
Q6A decision tree. No trends in microbial limit test have been seen in stability data. 
Omission of particle size in the proposed specification has been adequately justified.  
Satisfactory description has been provided for the in-house analytical methods and water 
determination according to Japanese pharmacopoeia. These methods (assay, related substances, 
determination of residual solvents, water content) in gilteritinib fumarate have been adequately 
validated in accordance with ICH Q2 (R1) guideline. Stability indicating properties of the HPLC methods 
used for determination of related substances have been demonstrated by forced degradation studies.  
Information from primary and secondary reference standard of gilteritinib fumarate and other 
reference materials used for the related substances test has been provided.  
Batch analysis data of gilteritinib fumarate have been provided. All batches were manufactured by the 
currently proposed manufacturers using the manufacturing process described in the dossier. All 
batches were tested according to the proposed specifications and the results demonstrate that the 
proposed manufacturing process is capable of producing active substance of consistent quality.

Stability 
Results from ICH stability studies performed on three pilot scale gilteritinib fumarate batches from the 
proposed manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package have been provided. Up to 24 
months long-term (25°C/60% RH) and 6 months accelerated data (40°C/75% RH) are available. All 
stability indicating specification parameters were tested. These included: description, Identification 
(IR), physical form (XRPD), related substances, water and assay. Microbial purity was also evaluated 
on samples stored under long term conditions (microbial limit test). The analytical methods used in 
these studies are the same as those for release, except for those for XPRD and microbial limit test, as 
these are not part of the active substance release specification. 
Supportive stability data from three pilot scale batches stored at long term conditions for 36 months 
and accelerated conditions for 6 months were also provided. Gilteritinib fumarate showed no change in 
any of the parameters monitored under the long-term condition for 24 months and under the 
accelerated condition for 6 months for all three batches. No changes were observed in the supportive 
stability batches either. 
Stress testing was performed on one primary pilot scale batch. Samples were stored at 60°C and 
40°C/75% RH for 3 months and to light (in accordance with ICH Q1B) for 2 months. Gilteritinib 
fumarate showed no change under the temperature and humidity conditions. In the photostability 
condition, slight decomposition was observed in the related substances test, but all results conformed 
to the specification. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted on one of the supportive pilot scale batches. Samples in 
solid state were exposed to temperature and light . Active substance in liquid form was exposed to acid 
, oxidation , base , temperature and light.  
The presented results from these studies include assay and chromatographic purity results, mass 
balance calculations and peak purity results. Based on these results, it has been concluded that 
gilteritinib fumarate is stable, but relatively sensitive to acid condition and oxidation.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
The proposed storage conditions “This drug substance does not require any special temperature 
storage conditions. Store in the original package to protect from light" are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Gilteritinib 40 mg tablets are round light yellow film-coated tablets, debossed with the ‘Astellas’ logo 
and ‘235’ on the same side. Gilteritinib tablets 40 mg contain 40 mg of gilteritinib (corresponding to 
44.2 mg gilteritinib fumarate).  
Other ingredients are: mannitol (E421), hydroxypropylcellulose, low-substituted 
hydroxypropylcellulose, magnesium stearate and film-coating composed of hypromellose, talc, 
macrogol 8000, titanium dioxide and iron oxide yellow (E172). 
The core tablet is composed of mannitol as a filler, hydroxypropylcellulose as a binder, 
hydoroxypropylcellulose, low-substituted as a disintegrant, and magnesium stearate as a lubricant. 
The film-coating is composed of hypromellose, talc, macrogol 8000, titanium dioxide, and iron oxide 
yellow. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur. standards, where available. Iron oxide yellow (E172) is not described in Ph. Eur. but it complies 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 16/126 
 
  
 
with Commission Regulation (EU) No. 231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The compatibility of gilteritinib fumarate with the excipients included in the tablets was 
investigated,using binary powder mixtures of the active substance with each excipient . Based on these 
results, it was concluded that the excipients do not influence the product stability at the proposed 
formulation ratio, condition of storage and use. 
The physicochemical properties of the active substance have been described in the active substance 
section. Briefly, gilteritinib fumarate is non-hygroscopic, crystalline solid that  is produced as only one 
crystalline form.Gilteritinib fumarate is classified a BCS class IV compound, having both low solubility 
and low permeability. In addition, the data from a mass balance study (2215-CL-0105) in humans 
indicated that gilteritinib fumarate can be classified as a compound with incomplete absorption. In 
order to ensure rapid drug dissolution in vivo, it was decided to formulate it into immediate release 
film-coated tablets.  
To proceed with the pharmaceutical development systematically, the quality target product profile 
(QTPP) for gilteritinib tablets 40 mg was defined as inmmedidate release film-coated tablets for oral 
administration containing 40 mg of gilteritinib, stable for at least 2 years at room temperature and with 
sufficient physical strength for handling and transportation. Using this profile, the CQAs necessary to 
ensure the performance of the finished product were identified: dissolution, assay, uniformity of 
dosage units, related substances, hardness and friability. These CQAs were then further used to set the 
acceptance criteria of commercial product applied during both the formulation and the manufacturing 
process development programs. 
The robustness of the formulation (composition) was investigated. Based on the analysis using an 
Ishikawa diagram (representing the relationship between raw material and commercial finished 
product quality) and prior knowledge from formulation development trials, a risk assessment on 
material attributes was performed using Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) to identify the 
component attributes of gilteritinib 40 mg tablets. The effects of the inert tablet components and film 
coating amounts on the CQAs of gilteritinib 40 mg tablets were found to be negligible, indicating that 
they had no significant impact on the quality of the product. 
In addition to the formulation that is intended for marketing, three formulations have been subject to 
clinical trials. 
For phase-1/2 clinical trial [2215-CL-0101] and phase-1 clinical trial [2215-CL-0102], tablets in three 
strengths, namely 10 mg, 40 mg, and 100 mg, were developed as film coated immediate release 
tablets For phase 3 clinical trials [2215-CL-0301], and commercialisation, a new 40 mg tablet named 
as gilteritinib 40 mg tablets was developed as a film coated immediate release tablet.  
Comparison of dissolution between the 40 mg tablets used in phase 1/2 and phase 3/commercial 
gilteritinib 40 mg tablets in 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid, acetate buffer (pH 4.5), phosphate buffer (pH 
6.8) and water have been submitted. Rapid and comparable dissolution from both tablets in all media 
was confirmed. In addition, a relative bioavailability study [2215-CL-0110] between those formulations 
showed a comparable PK profile. The proposed compositions and manufacturing processes for 
commercial product are the same as used in Phase 3 clinical studies as well used for the primary 
stability batches. 
The dissolution method development has been adequately described. Gilteritinib active substance is 
adequately soluble for dissolution testing in neutral to acidic pH range as described in the active 
substance section of this report. The selection of the dissolution media has been justified. To evaluate 
the discriminatory nature of the method, engineered tablets prepared making slight modifications of 
the excipient amounts and tablets prepared with a different compression force were prepared. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 17/126 
 
  
 
dissolution profiles of the engineering tablets which have the changed formulation along with the 
control tablets obtained by using the proposed quality control (QC) method were presented. The 
engineering tablets showed slower dissolution than the control tablets in both test conditions. The 
proposed dissolution method showed discriminability to the formulation change and to the variation of 
main compression force Thus, the discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been 
demonstrated. 
The manufacturing process is standard. For optimisation of the manufacturing process, risk assessment 
by FMEA was carried out on manufacturing parameters that might have an impact on the CQAs, based 
on knowledge obtained during examination of the formulation of the final product and experience from 
the production of the product used for clinical studies. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
finished product. Commercial scale manufacturing conditions were selected based on risk assessment 
of the manufacturing process and the results of the optimisation studies on lab scale. Risk re-
assessment of the manufacturing process was carried out after the examination of optimisation of the 
manufacturing method and scale-up study for commercial scale. 
The tablets are packed in aluminium blisters. The blister consists of a unit dose cavity formed from 
polyamide/aluminum foil/polyvinyl chloride laminated forming foil sealed with an aluminum foil/heat-
seal coated lidding foil. The blisters are packed in paperboard cartons. 
The PVC film that comes into contact with the drug product complies with EU 10/2011 and its 
subsequent amendments, including EU 1183/2012, and applicable sections of EC 1935/2004 and EC 
2023/2006. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
The packaging for commercial bulk holding and transportation has been described. The packaging 
material complies with the additive requirements listed in European Pharmacopoeia 3.1.5 
“Polyethylene with Additives for Containers for Parenteral Preparations and for Ophthalmic Preparations 
and Commission Regulation 10/2011. To confirm the suitability of this packaging system for gilteritinib 
40 mg tablets, bulk stability studies were performed (see stability section). 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for gilteritinib 40 mg tablets consists of milling of the active substance, wet 
granulation, blending with disintegrant and lubricant, tablet compression, film-coating with a non-
functional coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Manufacturing of the bulk product and packaging (primary and secondary) is performed at different 
sites.  The proposed hold time is supported by stability data and justified. Process validation has been 
performed on three consecutive commercial scale batches at the proposed manufacturing site. All the 
analytical results are well within acceptance criteria. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description  (visual),  identification  (UV,  HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units 
(NIR, HPLC) dissolution (Ph. Eur.), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.) and assay (NIR, HPLC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 18/126 
 
  
 
For uniformity of dosage units and assay, real time release testing by NIR using the core tablets is applied 
for routine release. Since the film-coating process is not expected to affect assay, this is acceptable.  
The applicant has described their procedure for alternative, traditional end-product testing by HPLC (on 
film-coated tables) in case the  NIR result  is not  available  (e.g. equipment failure).  The  HPLC  method 
using the film-coated tablets is applied for assay in the stability studies. Comparative test results (parallel 
testing) supporting the relationship between the end-product and the RTRT have been provided. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 
batches of gilteritinib tablets were provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was 
not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch 
data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the 
finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The absence of control for water content has been justified. The analytical methods used have been 
adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analyses have been presented for several batches including the three primary stability batches. 
All the commercial formulation batches comply with the specification that applied at the time. The 
results indicate consistency and uniformity of the product, and that the process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% 
RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  Xospata  are  identical  to  those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, assay, related substances, dissolution and water content. Microbial 
quality (microbial limit test) was also tested on samples stored under long term conditions. The analytical 
procedures used were the same as those proposed for release, except for water content which is not 
part of the release specification. 
No significant change was observed in any of the parameters tested at the long term or the accelerated 
storage  conditions.  The  proposed  extrapolation  of  shelf-life  period  (48  months)  beyond  the  period 
covered by long-term data (36 months) is therefore accepted. 
One of the three primary stability batches was also tested in the stress testing and the photostability 
testing.  
For the stress testing samples were exposed to high temperature and high temperature and humidity in 
open bottles. Data from 3 and 6 months are available, respectively. No significant changes were observed 
in the results of description, assay and dissolution at any of the tested conditions. A slight increase in a 
related  substance  was  observed,  but  the  levels  were  still  within  the  proposed  shelf  life  specification. 
There were no other degradation products which increased during the storage.  At high temperature a 
slight decrease  in the water content was observed during the storage, whereas a  slight increase was 
observed at high temperature and humidity but all results were within the proposed specification limits. 
The  photostability  testing  was  conducted  according  to  ICH  Q1B  guideline.  An  increase  in  a  related 
substance was observed above the shelf-life specification (0.2%) when the samples were exposed under 
D65 lamp.  
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 19/126 
 
  
 
Since D65 lamp is the one that demonstrates the outdoor daylight, xenon lamp with an optical filter to 
eliminate  radiation  below  320  nm  was  used  as  the  next  assessment  step  to  simulate  indoor  indirect 
daylight. When the tablets were exposed under this light, no degradation and no changes were observed. 
Therefore, the tablets do not require protection from indoor light. 
When the tablets packed in the commercial packaging configuration, aluminum blisters, were exposed 
under D65 lamp, all the data met the acceptance criteria and no changes were observed after the light 
exposure.  
Although the tablets were demonstrated to not be affected by indoor light, the storage condition “store 
in the original package in order to protect from light” applies due to the results observed under standard 
photostability conditions. 
A stability study to support the holding time of the bulk tablets after manufacture and prior to finished 
product  packaging  was  performed.  No  significant  changes  were  observed  in  any  of  the  parameters 
tested. All the data met the acceptance criteria. Based on the results of this study, and the justification 
of the relevance of the data from batches packed in the preliminary bulk package, it was concluded that 
the proposed bulk packaging  and holding  time  under controlled storage conditions not  exceeding  the 
conditions evaluated in the bulk stability studies are acceptable. 
Nonetheless, the applicant has committed to continue the bulk stability study with the commercial bulk 
package up to the claimed holding period  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months and the storage condition “store 
in the original package in order to protect from light”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant has presented sufficient evidence that the drug substance and the drug product are 
manufactured under current EU GMP.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development 
of the active substance and/or finished product and their manufacturing process. However, no design 
spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished 
product. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
To clarify characteristics of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of gilteritinib fumarate, 
a  series  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  dogs,  and  cynomolgus  monkeys  were 
conducted  using  14C-labeled  gilteritinib  fumarate  (14C-gilteritinib  fumarate)  and  non-radiolabeled 
gilteritinib fumarate. The animal species used in these studies include those used in the pharmacology 
and toxicity studies. Oral administration was used in most in vivo studies as in toxicity studies, which is 
the  same  dosing  route  with  that  used  in  clinical  studies.  In  some  studies,  the  different  route  of 
administration  or  dose  was  used  to  achieve  the  aim  of  the  pharmacokinetic  investigation. 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of gilteritinib-derived components was clarified by investigating tissue distribution 
of radioactivity after a single and repeated administration of 14C gilteritinib fumarate to rats, plasma 
protein binding of gilteritinib in animal species, and excretion of radioactivity to urine, bile, and faeces 
after  oral  administration  to  rats  and  dogs.  In  addition,  in  vitro  metabolism  studies  using  animal  and 
human biomaterials, and in vivo metabolic profiling studies in rats, dogs, and humans were conducted. 
Nonclinical safety of gilteritinib fumarate was evaluated in the following studies: a single-dose toxicity 
study in rats; repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs (13-week administration in rats, 4- and 13-
week administrations in dogs); genotoxicity studies using bacteria, cultured mammalian cells, and mice; 
a reproductive and developmental toxicity  study  in rats; a juvenile animal toxicity study in rats; and 
other  toxicity  studies  (a  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  of  an  impurity  in  rats;  genotoxicity  studies  of  an 
impurity  using  bacteria  and  cultured  mammalian  cells;  and  a  phototoxicity  study  using  cultured 
mammalian cells).  
All pivotal toxicology studies and studies on safety pharmacology are  Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
compliant.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
• 
In vitro 
Inhibitory effect of gilteritinib on FLT3 and other tyrosine kinases 
Gilteritinib fumarate inhibited activities of FLT3, nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK), leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK), ALK and AXL kinases by over 50% at 1 nmol/L in a mobility shift 
assay.  At  a  concentration  of  5  nmol/L,  more  than  50%  inhibition  of  the  tyrosine  kinase  activity  of 
tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TRKA), ROS, RET and MER was also detected ( 
Table 1).

Gilteritinib  fumarate  half  maximal  inhibitory  concentration  (IC50)  for  inhibition  of  FLT3,  LTK,  AXL, 
echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK variant 1 and KIT tyrosine kinase (KIT) 
kinase activities were determined to 0.291, 0.350, 0.726, 1.2 and 229 nmol/L, respectively (2215-PH-
0006, 2215-PH-0017, 2215-PH-0001). 
Effects of gilteritinib in cells expressing FLT3 mutants 
Gilteritinib fumarate inhibited the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-wt, FLT3-ITD, FLT3- D835Y 
and FLT3-ITD-D835Y with IC50 values of 0.92, 1.8, 1.6 and 2.1 nmol/L, respectively (2215-PH-0009). 
In Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD, the ratios of phosphorylated FLT3 after treatment with gilteritinib 
fumarate at 0.1, 1 and 10 nmol/L were 78%, 34% and 3%, respectively, compared to the vehicle control. 
Similarly, the ratios of phosphorylated FLT3 were 74%, 45% and 1% in Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-
D835Y, and 75%, 42% and 4% in Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD-D835Y, respectively. Phosphorylation 
of STAT5, AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was also inhibited by gilteritinib fumarate 
in these cells (2215-PH-0015). 
Effects of gilteritinib in a human AML cell line (MV4-11) expressing FLT3-ITD 
Gilteritinib fumarate inhibited the growth of MV4- 11 cells with an IC50 value of 0.92 nmol/L (2215-PH-
0008). Treatment of the same cell line with gilteritinib fumarate at 0.1, 1 and 10 nmol/L resulted in FLT3 
phosphorylation  ratios  of 57%,  8%  and  1%,  respectively,  compared  to  the  control  (2215-PH-  0010). 
Downstream molecules of FLT3  such as STAT5, AKT, and ERK phosphorylation were also inhibited by 
treatment  of  gilteritinib  fumarate.  Gilteritinib  fumarate  at  0.1,  1  and  10  nmol/L  showed  STAT5 
phosphorylation ratios of 114%, 23% and 0%, respectively; AKT phosphorylation of 65%, 48% and 9%, 
respectively;  and  ERK  phosphorylation of  54%,  22%  and  1%,  respectively,  compared  to  the  vehicle-
treated control (2215-PH-0014). The effect of gilteritinib fumarate (1, 3, 10 and 30 nmol/L) on cell cycle 
distribution was also investigated. Gilteritinib fumarate at 3 and 10 nmol/L increased the population of 
MV4-11 cells in G1 phase compared to the 0 nmol/L-treated group (2215-PH-9004). Gilteritinib fumarate 
at  3,  10  and  30  nmol/L  increased  the  annexin-V-positive  population  in  MV4-11  cells,  indicating  that 
gilteritinib fumarate induced apoptosis in this cell line (2215-PH-9005). 
• 
In vivo 
Effects of gilteritinib in mice subcutaneously xenografted with MV4-11 cells 
The antitumour effect of gilteritinib fumarate, given by oral administration at 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg per 
day,  once-daily  for  28  days  in  mice  xenografted  with  MV4-11  cells  was  examined  (2215-PH-0011). 
Gilteritinib  fumarate  inhibited  the  growth  or  induced  the  regression  of  MV4-11  tumours.  Gilteritinib 
fumarate  at  6  and  10  mg/kg  per  day  induced  complete  tumour  regression  in  4/6  and  6/6  mice, 
respectively. The body weights (BWs) of the mice treated with gilteritinib fumarate were not affected at 
any doses tested.

The  effect  of  a  single  oral  administration  of  gilteritinib  fumarate  at  1,  3,  6  or  10  mg/kg  on  the 
phosphorylation of FLT3 and STAT5 was investigated in tumours from mice xenografted subcutaneously 
(sc) with MV4-11 cells. Tumours were collected 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 h after the administration. Phosphorylation 
of FLT3 and STAT5, as detected by immunoprecipitation or electrophoresis + immunodetection of lysates 
from MV4-11 tumours, was decreased by administration of gilteritinib (2215-PH-9006). 
Effects of gilteritinib in mice xenografted with MV4-11 cells into tibia 
The effect of once-daily oral administration of gilteritinib fumarate at 30 mg/kg per day on tumour growth 
(monitored  by  bioluminescence)  and  survival  were  examined  in  mice  inoculated  with  MV4-11  cells 
expressing luciferase (MV4-11-luc cells) into the tibia. Either vehicle or gilteritinib fumarate was orally 
administered once daily for 56 days starting at 15 days after tumour cell inoculation on day 0. Gilteritinib 
fumarate  induced  decrease  in  the  tumour  growth  compared  to  the  control  group  on  day  42.  
Improvement in survival was observed in the gilteritinib fumarate group compared to the control group. 
Median  survival  time  of  the  control  group  was  61.5  days,  whereas  no  death  was  observed  in  the 
gilteritinib fumarate group until day 168, the final day of observation (2215-PH-0021). 
Plasma and intratumoural gilteritinib concentrations in mice  subcutaneous (sc) xenografted with MV4-
11cells 
Plasma  and intratumoural concentrations of gilteritinib after  a single oral administration of gilteritinib 
fumarate (1, 6 and 10 mg/kg) in mice sc xenografted with MV4-11 cells were measured (2215-PH-0016). 
Results for plasma and tumour are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Effect of gilteritinib fumarate in 3T3 Cells and NCI-H2228 cells expressing EML4-ALK mutants 
Gilteritinib fumarate inhibited the proliferation of 3T3 cells expressing EML4-ALK variant 1, 2 and 3 with 
IC50 values of 0.42, 0.50 and 0.95 nmol/L, respectively (2215-PH-0003). Gilteritinib fumarate inhibited 
the  anchorage-independent  growth  of  NCI-H2228,  human  non-small-cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  cells

endogenously expressing EML4-ALK variant 3, with an IC50 value of 0.74 nmol/L (2215-PH-0002). In 
NCI-H2228  cells,  treatment  of  gilteritinib  fumarate  at  0.1,  1  and  10  nmol/L  resulted  in  ALK 
phosphorylation of 69%, 18% and 2%, respectively, compared to the vehicle-treated control (2215-PH-
0004). 
Affinity of gilteritinib fumarate to receptors, ion channels, transporters and inhibitory effect of gilteritinib 
fumarate on enzyme activities 
Gilteritinib fumarate at 10 μmol/L showed more than 50% inhibition against specific radio-ligand binding 
to  serotonin  5HT2B  (human)  receptor,  sigma  (nonselective,  guinea  pig)  receptor,  serotonin  5HT1 
(nonselective,  rat)  receptor  and  adenosine  A1  (rat)  receptor,  with  respective  IC50  values  of  0.190, 
0.615,  4.90  and  4.57  μmol/L.  Specific  radioligand  bindings  to  all  other  receptors,  ion  channels, 
transporters  and  tested  enzyme  activities  were not  inhibited  (less than  50% inhibition) by  gilteritinib 
fumarate at 10 μmol/L (2215-PH-0007). The agonistic and antagonistic effects of gilteritinib fumarate 
on human serotonin 5HT2B receptor function was examined by measuring intracellular calcium levels in 
cells expressing human serotonin 5HT2B receptor. Gilteritinib fumarate did not show agonistic activity 
on  human  serotonin  5HT2B  receptor  up  to  10  μmol/L.  Gilteritinib  fumarate  inhibited  human  5HT2B 
receptor function with an IC50 value of 5.82 μmol/L (2215-TX-0007). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Effects of gilteritinib on the hERG current in HEK293 cells (study 2215-PT-0001, GLP) 
Potential effects of gilteritinib (1×10−6, 3×10−6, 1×10−5, and 3×10−5 mol/L in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO)) and positive control E-4031 (1×10−7 mol/L) on the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG)-
current was tested using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The peak amplitude of tail currents was 
measured in 5 separate cells in each experimental group, and the change rates (suppression rates) of 
the  amplitude  13  minutes  after  beginning  the  application  were  calculated.  Subsequently,  the  hERG-
current-suppression rate in each cell was compensated for by the mean suppression rate of the negative 
control (DMSO group). 
The positive control, inhibited hERG tail current, and the compensated suppression rate 13 minutes after 
beginning the application was 88.4% (statistically significant from the control group).  
The compensated suppression rates of gilteritinib at the concentrations of 1×10−6, 3×10−6, 1×10−5, and 
3×10−5 mol/L were 1.0%, 18.1%, 32.8%, and 70.7%, respectively; statistically significant differences 
were noted at the three highest doses, when compared to the rate in the negative control group. 
The  results  indicated  that  gilteritinib  suppresses  the  hERG  current  in  human  embryonic  kidney  293 
(HEK293) cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 1.6×10−5 mol/L (16 µmol/L, = 8.84 
μg/mL). 
Effects of gilteritinib on the cardiac ion channels (NaV1.5, CaV1.2 calcium channel (CaV1.2), KV7.1/minK 
potassium channel (KV7.1/minK), KV4.3, and Kir2.1) in Stably Expressing Cell Lines (study 2215-PT-
0006, GLP) 
The effects of gilteritinib fumarate (0.09, 1, and 10 μmol/L in 0.1% DMSO) on the cardiac ion channels 
were  investigated  using  HEK293  cells  transfected  with  NaV1.5  and  KV7.1/minK,  or  chinese  hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells transfected with CaV1.2, KV4.3, and Kir2.1. After 15-min (NaV1.5, KV7.1/minK, KV4.3, 
and Kir2.1) or 13-min (CaV1.2) exposure, change in each channel current was measured using a patch-
clamp technique.

Only  the  compensated  suppression  rate  of  KV7.1/minK  at  10  μmol/L  showed  statistically  significant 
difference from the control group. Furthermore, KV7.1/minK current was higher in 1 of 5 cells at 1 μmol/L 
(the compensated suppression rate: −38.2%), and CaV1.2 current was higher in 2 of 5 cells each at 1 
and  10  μmol/L  (the  compensated  suppression  rate:  −33.9%  and  −34.8%  at  1  μmol/L;  −24.8%  and 
−43.8% at 10 μmol/L).  
Effects of gilteritinib on hERG trafficking in hERG-transfected HEK293 cells (study 2215-PT-0008, GLP) 
The effect of gilteritinib fumarate (0.1, 1, and 10 μmol/L in 0.09% DMSO), negative control (DMSO) and 
positive control (pentamidine at 30 μmol/L) on hERG trafficking was tested in HEK293 cells. After 24-h 
exposure, the peak amplitude of tail currents and  membrane capacities were measured in 5 separate 
cells  for  each  group.  In  the  vehicle  control  group,  the  current  density  was  159.7  pA/pF.  The  hERG-
trafficking inhibitor pentamidine reduced the current density to 5.4% ± 1.6% of the negative control. 
The  current  densities  in  the  gilteritinib  hemifumarate  groups  at  0.1,  1,  and  10  μmol/L,  were  74.5%, 
75.7%,  and  58.6%,  respectively,  of  that  in  the  negative  control  group,  and  were  not  statistically 
significantly different from controls, although a trend towards lower density compared to controls were 
indicated  in  the  high  dose  group.  Gilteritinib  fumarate  did  not  affect  the  hERG  trafficking  at 
concentrations of up to 10 μmol/L (5.53 μg/mL). 
Effects of gilteritinib on action potential duration in ex-vivo human ventricular purkinje fibers from normal 
male donors (study 2215-PT-0007, non-GLP) 
The effects of gilteritinib on action potentials in isolated human cardiac Purkinje fibers from brain-dead 
male donors were studied at 0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 μM (presumed concentrations: 0.05570 and 0.5219 μM 
at 0.1 and 1.0 μM nominal concentrations, respectively, and mean actual concentration: 4.245 μM at 5.0 
μM nominal concentration (studies 2215-PT-0009, 2215-PT-0010, 2215-PT-0012).The positive control 
prolonged APD30, APD50, APD90, Triangulation, and STV by 11.78%, 43.20%, 105.76%, 227.01%, and 
700.12, respectively, at the 1 Hz pacing frequency. Gilteritinib hemifumarate did not affect any of the 
evaluated parameters at concentrations up to 4.245 µM (2346 ng/mL).  
Effects of gilteritinib hemifumarate on the central nervous system in rats (study 2215-PT-0003, GLP) 
Gilteritinib  fumarate  was  suspended  in  0.5  w/v  %  methylcellulose  aqueous  solution  and  orally 
administered once at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg to 6 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats per group to investigate 
the effects on the central nervous system (CNS) for 24 hours following the modified Irwin’s method. A 
satellite group was added to measure plasma concentration of gilteritinib. No gilteritinib-related effects 
were observed on general  activity or behaviour, including spontaneous activity, motor incoordination, 
central excitation (tremor, twitches or convulsions), reflexes, muscle tonus, or general behaviour. At 30 
mg/kg, a decreased number of animals with urination were noted from 4 to 10 h after dosing. At 100 
mg/kg,  a  decreased  number  of  animals  with  urination  was  noted  from  4  to  24  h  after  dosing,  and

decreased  number  of  animals  with  defecation  was  noted  from  2  to  24  h  after  dosing.    The  time  to 
observed Cmax (tmax) in plasma at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg was 10, 10, and 8 h, respectively, and the 
maximum concentration (Cmax) was 109.71, 318.62, and 805.52 ng/mL respectively.  
Effects of gilteritinib hemifumarate on the central nervous system in rats (follow up study, study 2215-
PT-0004, GLP). 
An additional study with observations until 168 hours was conducted to investigate the reversibility of 
the effects observed at 100 mg/kg in the study 2215-PT-0003. At 100 mg/kg, a decreased number of 
animals with urination were observed from 8 through 48 h after dosing, but not from 72 h after dosing 
onward. Similarly, a decreased number of animals with defecation were observed from 4 through 24 h 
after dosing, but not from 48 h after dosing onward. The tmax value was 10.0 h and the Cmax value was 
729 ng/mL. 
Effects  of  gilteritinib  hemifumarate  on  the  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  system  in  conscious  beagle 
dogs (study 2215-PT-0002, GLP) 
Gilteritinib  fumarate  was  suspended  in  0.5  w/v%  methylcellulose  aqueous  solution  and  orally 
administered once at escalating dose levels of 0 (vehicle, control), 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg to 4 
male  beagle  dogs  (fasted  overnight).  Parameters  evaluated  included  general  activity  and  behaviour, 
body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration rate, blood gas, and 
blood electrolyte concentrations; and plasma drug concentrations. At 3 mg/kg, retching was noted in 1 
animal. At 10 mg/kg, vomiting (2 animals) and a positive faecal occult blood reaction (2 animals) were 
noted. At 30 mg/kg, vomiting and a positive faecal occult blood reaction were noted in 3 and 1 animals, 
respectively. Blood calcium concentration was also decreased by 7% of pre-dose value 48 h after dosing. 
At 100 mg/kg, vomiting in all animals, a positive faecal occult blood reaction in 2 animals, and salivation 
in  1  animal  were  noted.  An  increase  (11%)  and  a  decrease  (3%)  in the  blood  calcium  concentration 
compared  to  pre-dose  value  were  noted  24  and  48  h  post  dose,  respectively.  All  of  these  findings 
recovered  by  the  end  of  1-  or  2-week  recovery  period.  Gilteritinib  fumarate  did  not  affect  body 
temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, respiration rate, or blood gas, at any doses tested. The 
plasma concentration of gilteritinib at 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg had tmax values of 8.0, 9.0, 9.5, 13.0, 
and  9.0  h,  respectively,  and  Cmax  of  13.85,  46.02,  125.64,  265.76,  and  257.44  ng/mL,  respectively. 
Vomiting occurred in all animals of the 100 mg/kg group in 9 to 118 min after dosing. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic (PD) drug interaction studies have been conducted with gilteritinib (see discussion 
on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  radioactivity  level  in  biological  samples  obtained  after  administration  of  14C-gilteritinib  fumarate 
was measured using a liquid scintillation counter, or by whole body autoradiography.  Gilteritinib plasma 
concentrations in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs were measured using validated liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  
After  a  single  intravenous  (iv)  administration  of  gilteritinib  fumarate  to  rats  and  dogs,  the  plasma 
concentration of gilteritinib showed two elimination phases and decreased with t1/2 of 6.93 and 25.4 h 
in  rats  and  dogs,  respectively.  In  patients,  the  reported  half-life  following  repeated  oral  dose 
administration is reported to be even longer (45 to 159 h, ref, study 2215-CL-0101). CLtot and Vss were 
3.89 L/h/kg and 25.7 L/kg in rats, and 1.28 L/h/kg and 38.8 L/kg in dogs, respectively. After a single 
oral administration of gilteritinib fumarate to rats and dogs, tmax was 4 to 6.5 h.

Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from the time of dosing extrapolated to time 
infinity (AUCinf) increased more than dose-proportionally from 1 to 10 mg/kg in rats, of which tendency 
was more remarkable from 3 to 10 mg/kg. In dogs, Cmax and AUCinf increased almost dose-proportionally 
from 0.3 to 1 mg/kg, and slightly more than dose-proportionally from 1 to 3 mg/kg in dogs. Bioavailability 
(BA)  was 26.8%, 35.8%,  and 68.6% at 1,  3, and 10 mg/kg in rats and BA was 88.2%, 88.7%, and 
118.4% at 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg in dogs, respectively. 
A tendency to lower exposure in female dogs compared to male dogs was observed, but there was no 
consistent gender related differences in rats. 
After repeated dose administration retention and slow elimination was observed in the following organs: 
adrenal  gland,  thoracic  aorta,  spleen,  thyroid,  heart,  kidney,  testis,  femoral  muscle,  brain,  white  fat, 
thymus, submandibular lymph node, bone marrow, and stomach. In these tissues, levels > 10% of the 
maxima were still detectable 14 days after the last dose. Binding to melanin was evident and Cmax s of 
unchanged gilteritinib in the eyeballs of pigmented rats were approximately 30-fold higher than those of 
non-pigmented  rats.  The  elimination  half-life  from  eyeballs  was  409  days.  The  retention  time  in 
pigmented skin was approximately 2-4 weeks, compared to a few days in non-pigmented skin.  
After a single oral administration of 14C-gilteritinib fumarate at 1 mg/kg to rats on Day 14 of gestation, 
radioactivity was detected in the placenta during the whole sample period of 72 hours. In the foetus, the 
radioactivity  concentration  was  above  levels  detected  in  plasma.  After  a  single  oral  administration  of 
14C-gilteritinib  fumarate  at  1  mg/kg  to  lactating  rats  on  day  14  postpartum,  the  radioactivity  was 
detected in milk at a concentration > 30 fold the concentration in plasma. Foetal exposure via milk was 
confirmed by detection of radioactivity in infant tissues. 
The in vitro plasma protein binding ratios of gilteritinib were 85.1% to 89.6% in normal mice, 75.4% to 
84.2% in pharmacological model mice, 77.7% to 79.2% in rats, 75.5% to 78.7% in rabbits, 78.0% to 
80.7%  in  dogs,  81.3%  to  82.4%  in  cynomolgus  monkeys,  and  90.2%  to  90.5%  in humans.    After  a 
single oral administration of 14C-gilteritinib fumarate at 1 mg/kg to rats and dogs, the blood to plasma 
radioactivity concentration ratios (Cb/Cp) at 4 and 8 h were 3.42 and 3.09, respectively. 
In in vitro metabolic profiling studies of gilteritinib in liver microsomes and cryopreserved hepatocytes 
in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans, the metabolite peaks detected in human 
liver microsomes and hepatocytes, except for one minor metabolite, were also detected in at least one 
other species. After a single oral administration of 14C-gilteritinib fumarate at 1 mg/kg to rats and dogs, 
the major radioactive component of plasma was gilteritinib. Various metabolites were detected in urine, 
bile,  and  faeces.  Giteritinib  was  suggested  to  be  metabolized  by  oxidation,  N-dealkylation,  and 
glutathione conjugation. All metabolites detected in humans, except for two minor metabolites (M4 and 
M6), were detected in at least either rats or dogs. 
The  major  excretion  route  in  rats  and  dogs  was  faeces,  which  is  similar  to  the  excretion  pattern  in 
patients. After a single oral administration of 14C-gilteritinib fumarate at 1 mg/kg to rats, the cumulative 
urinary and faecal excretion of radioactivity within 168 h post-dose was 1.4% and 89.9% of the dose, 
respectively.  After  a  single  oral  administration  of  14C-gilteritinib  fumarate  at  1  mg/kg  to  dogs,  the 
cumulative urinary and faecal excretion of radioactivity within 504 h post-dose was 9.5% and 88.1% of 
the dose, respectively. Enterohepatic circulation of gilteritinib-derived components was also observed in 
rats.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  rats  and  acute  toxicity  of  gilteritinib  fumarate  was 
evaluated in a 4-week study in dogs. 
Single dose oral toxicity study in Sprague Dawley rats (report nr 2215-TX-0001, GLP) 
A  single  oral  gavage  dose  of  gilteritinib  fumarate  suspended  in  vehicle  (0.5  w/v%  methylcellulose 
aqueous solution) was administered at a dose of 100 or 300 mg/kg to 5 male and 5 female 7 week old 
Crl:CD SD strain rats per group after overnight fasting. Male and female rats in the 300 mg/kg group 
died or were sacrificed moribund from 1 to 2 days after dosing; the approximate lethal dose of gilteritinib 
fumarate in rats was considered to be 300 mg/kg.  In animals that died or were moribund, decreased 
BW,  decreased  spontaneous  activity,  hyphema,  sparse  fur  (abdomen),  pale  skin,  decreased  stool 
volume,  black  stool  (a  positive  fecal  occult  blood  reaction),  and  hypothermia,  were  noted.  
Histopathology  of  animals  that  died  or  were  sacrificed  moribund  showed  haemorrhage,  epithelial 
vacuolation, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the duodenum; haemorrhage in the anterior chamber; 
haemorrhage and erosion in the forestomach, necrosis of the lymphocyte in the ceacal lymphoid follicle; 
and necrosis of the lymphocyte and haemorrhage in the thymus.

Reproduction Toxicity 
•  Dose-range  finding  study  of  gilteritinib  hemifumarate  on  embryo-foetal  development  by  oral 
gavage administration in SD rats (study report no 2215-TX-0010, non-GLP) 
Gilteritinib hemifumarate was administered orally to pregnant rats (12 weeks old when administration 
started) at dose levels of 0, 5, 20, or 30 mg/kg/day during the period from implantation to closure of 
the hard palate (from Day 7 to Day 17 of gestation). In the 20 and 30 mg/kg groups, decreases in BW 
and food consumption were noted from the initiation of dosing in dams. From 20 mg/kg, postimplantation 
loss rate, low foetal BW, and low numbers of ossified sternebrae and sacral and caudal vertebrae were 
observed. Visceral and skeletal variations were observed at high frequencies in these groups. In the 30 
mg/kg group, anasarca, limb hyperextension, membranous ventricular septum defect, absent kidney, 
malpositioned  kidney,  small  kidney,  malpositioned  adrenal,  absent  uterine  horn,  fused  rib,  and 
hemicentric  thoracic  centrum  were  observed  as  abnormalities.  In  the  20  mg/kg  group,  membranous 
ventricular septum defect was observed as a visceral abnormality in 1 foetus.  
• 
Embryo-foetal development study of gilteritinib fumarate by oral gavage in SD rats ( study report 
no 2215-TX-0011, GLP) 
Gilteritinib fumarate was administered once daily by oral gavage to 19 to 20 pregnant (SD) rats (12 to 
15 weeks of age at the initiation of dosing). The  dose  levels were 0.3, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg per day 
during the period from implantation to closure of the hard palate (from day 7 through 17 of gestation). 
In dams at the highest dose of 30 mg/kg /day, decrease in BW was noted from the initiation of dosing 
until  necropsy,  and  a  decrease  in  food  consumption  was  noted  from  the  initiation  of  dosing  until  the 
completion of dosing. In the same dose group of 30 mg/kg/day changes related to gilteritinib was noted. 
High  postimplantation  loss  rate,  low  foetal  BW,  low  placental  weight,  and  low  numbers  of  ossified 
sternebrae and sacral and caudal vertebrae were observed. Anasarca, local oedema, exencephaly, cleft 
lip, cleft palate, short tail, and umbilical hernia as external abnormalities (frequency of each abnormality 
were  0.41%  to  6.74%  and  frequency  of  total  abnormalities  were  13.53%).  Microphthalmia,  enlarged 
atrial chamber, enlarged ventricular chamber, membranous ventricular septum defect, hypoplastic right 
ventricle, absent kidney, fused kidney, abnormal revolution of kidney, malpositioned kidney, misshapen 
kidney,  small  kidney,  malpositioned  adrenal,  and  malpositioned  ovary  as  visceral  abnormalities 
(frequency of each finding were 0.75% to 12.21% and frequency of total abnormalities were 32.74%) 
were  observed.  Sternoschisis,  absent  rib,  fused  rib,  fused  cervical  arch,  misaligned  cervical  vertebra, 
and absent thoracic vertebra were  seen as skeletal abnormalities. The  frequency of each abnormality 
was 0.88% to 1.05%, with a frequency of total abnormalities of 3.69%. Visceral and skeletal variations 
were also observed at high frequencies.  
Based on these results, the maternal and developmental no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 
considered 10 mg/kg /day. At the NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day, the gilteritinib exposure (AUC over the 24-
hour dosing interval  (AUC24)  on day 17) was 1930  ng·h/mL  which  was approximately  0.06 times the 
exposure at maximum clinical dose (31428 ng·h/mL at 200 mg/kg/day) 
Toxicokinetic analysis of plasma exposures to gilteritinib is displayed in Table 7.

Dose range finding toxicity study of gilteritinib fumarate in SD rats (study report no 2215-TX-0015, non-
GLP) 
Gilteritinib was suspended in 0.5 w/v% methylcellulose solution and orally administered once daily for 
18 days from postnatal days (PNDs) 4 to 21. The dose levels of 0 (vehicle control), 5, and 10 mg/kg/day 
gilteritinib were administered to 6 male and 6 female (SD) juvenile rats per group in order to select dose 
levels of gilteritinib hemifumarate for a definitive GLP study where juvenile animals would be dose from 
PND 4 to 42. 
A satellite group (12 males and 12 females in the control group, and 39 males and 39 females at 5, 10, 
and  20  mg/kg/day)  was  added  to  assess  systemic  exposure  to  gilteritinib,  and  this  satellite  group 
included some toxicity evaluation. From 10 mg/kg per day, some animals died or were euthanized due 
to  moribundity,  and  abnormal  stool  color  (dark  red)  and/or  abdominal  distention  were  observed  in 
moribund or surviving animals. 
Juvenile toxicity study of gilteritinib hemifumarate in SD rats (study report no 2215-TX-0016, GLP) 
Gilteritinib hemifumarate was suspended in 0.5 w/v% methylcellulose solution and orally administered 
once daily for 39 days from PND 4 to 42 at dose levels of 0 (vehicle control), 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day 
to male and  female (SD) juvenile rats (n=12). 6 male and 6 female rats were added to the control and 
2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day groups to assess the reversibility of toxicity during a subsequent 28-day recovery 
period. A satellite group (15 males and 15 females in the control group, and 48 males and 48 females 
in each test article group) was added to assess systemic exposure.  
One male rat in the 2.5 mg/kg per day satellite group showed prone position and hypothermia before 
dosing  on  day  9  of  dosing,  and  this  animal  was  then  euthanized  due  to  moribundity. 
Congestion/haemorrhage were observed in the  lamina propria of the  ileum  and in  the mucosa of the 
cecum, and necrosis of the lymphocytes was observed in the thymus cortex. Necrosis of the lymphocytes 
in  the  thymus  cortex  was  considered  to  be  a  secondary  change  due  to  deterioration  of  the  general 
condition. In the surviving animals, decreased BW and BW gain were noted in males at 5 mg/kg per day 
and in females at 2.5 mg/kg per day and higher, and decreased food consumption was noted from2.5 
mg/kg per day (both sexes).The changes in BW and food consumption noted during the dosing period 
showed reversibility. 
The NOAEL was determined to 1 mg/kg/day, based on the findings in the 2.5 mg/kg/day dose group.

Other toxicity studies 
In 4-Week Repeated Oral Dose Toxicity Study evaluating the synthesis related impurity in Rats (Impurity 
Toxicity  Study,  2215-TX-0012,  GLP)  the  following  observations  and  examinations  were  performed: 
clinical  signs,  BW,  food  consumption,  ophthalmology,  hematology,  blood  chemistry,  urinalysis,  gross 
pathology,  organ  weight,  and  histopathology.  There  were  no  dead  or  moribund  animals.  No 
toxicologically significant changes were noted in any observations, measurements, or examinations in 
any groups. 
Bacterial reverse mutation test was performed with 5 test strains of bacteria (S. typhimurium TA100, 
TA1535, TA98, and TA1537, and E. coli WP2uvrA) using the preincubation method, in the presence or 
absence of rat liver S9 (Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test of the related impurity, 2215-TX-0013, GLP). 
As compared with the negative control, no 2-fold or greater increases or dose-dependent increases in 
the number of revertant colonies were observed in any test strain, with or without S9, in either the dose 
range-finding  test  or  the  main  test.  It  was  concluded  that  the  related  impurity  did  not  induce  gene 
mutation in S. typhimurium or E. coli under the conditions of this study. 
A Chromosomal Aberration Test of the synthesis related impurity in Cultured Mammalian Cells (2215-
TX-0014, GLP) was performed with CHL cells in short-term treatment for 6 h in the presence of absence 
of rat liver S9, and in continuous treatment for 24 h without S9. Chromosomal aberrations were analyzed 
at the following concentrations:2.5, 3, 3.5 and  4 μg/mL  in short-term treatment  without  S9  (the cell 
proliferation ratio at the highest concentration was 51.4% that of the negative control); 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 
4 μg/mL in short-term treatment with S9 (the cell proliferation ratio at the highest concentration was 
58.6%  that of  the  negative  control);  and  2,  2.5,  3, and  3.5  μg/mL  in  continuous  treatment  for 24 h 
without  S9  (the  cell  proliferation  ratio  at  the  highest  concentration  was  52.6%  that  of  the  negative 
control). The number and incidence of cells with structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations were 
counted  and  calculated.  As  compared  with  the  negative  control  group,  no  statistically  significant 
increases in the number of cells with structural or numerical chromosomal aberrations were noted in any 
treatment group. It was concluded that, under the conditions of this study, the related impurity did not 
induce chromosomal aberrations in CHL cells, regardless of treatment time with or without S9. 
As a result, the high dose level in the 4-week toxicity study was the NOAEL for rats, and the synthesis 
related impurity did not show mutagenicity or clastogenicity. A human equivalent dose calculated based

on the NOAEL in rats multiplied by purity of used test substance, the rat body surface area conversion 
factor (0.162), and a human BW of 60 kg is higher than the possible maximum intake of this impurity 
at the maximum clinical dose (200 mg per day), which is calculated based on the acceptance criterion 
for this impurity in the specification.  
A phototoxicity study (report no 2215-TX-0006) was performed with cultured mammalian cells (Balb/c 
3T3 cells) at 9.49, 13.3, 18.6, 26.0, 36.4, 51.0, 71.4 and 100 μg/mL, with and without ultraviolet A (UV-
A) irradiation. The IC50 was calculated in both the presence and absence of irradiation, and  the peak 
inspiratory  flow  (PIF)  (actual  value:  1.018)  was  less  than  2.  A  PIF  value  below  2  indicates  “no 
phototoxicity” (according to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guideline 
432 regarding in vitro 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical pharmacology data that have been submitted, they confirmed a role of FLT3 inhibition 
in the observed anti-proliferative effect induced by gilteritinib fumarate in vitro and in animal xenograft 
models.  Kd-values  have  not  been  presented,  but  gilteritinib  appears  to  display  comparable  inhibitory 
potency  on  both  wild-type  FLT3,  FLT3-IDT  and  FLT3-D835Y.  In  view  of  the  known  role  of  FLT3,  and 
overexpression of FLT3 and oncogenic FLT3 mutants occurring in AML cells, a therapeutic rationale is 
justified. The presented in vitro and xenograft model results are based on FLT3 forms assumed to be of 
human origin. Inhibition of EML4-ALK or LTK is not expected to contribute to the effect of gilteritinib in 
AML,  since  these  kinases  have  not  been  reported  to  play  a  role  in  FLT3  mutated  AML.  In  contrast, 
inhibition of AXL by gilteritinib may translate into antiproliferative effect in AML. In addition, activated 
AXL is reported to be responsible for resistance to FLT3 inhibitors such as quizartinib and midostaurin in 
FLT3-ITD positive AML cells.  
An IC50 = 5.82 µmol/L for inhibition of 5HT2B function was established (2215-TX-0007). At a daily dose 
of 120 mg and 200 mg gilteritinib in the phase 1/2 dose escalation/dose expansion study 2215-CL-0101, 
the median unbound Cmax at day 15 was 22.1-146.2 ng/mL (40.0-264.4 nmol/L). This is approximately 
22-145 fold lower than the IC50 for functional inhibition of the serotonin 5HT2B receptor. Taken together, 
results from non-clinical pharmacology studies suggest low probability of secondary effects of gilteritinib 
related to targets that are not tyrosine kinases. 
Based  on  in  vitro  data,  gilteritinib  may  reduce  the  effects  of  medicinal  products  that  target  5HT2B 
receptor or sigma nonspecific receptor (e.g., escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline). The concomitant use 
of these medicinal products with Xospata should be avoided unless use is considered essential for the

care of the patient (SmPC section 4.5). Due to in vitro binding to 5HT2B (there is a potential impact on 
cardiac development in patients less than 6 months of age (SmPC section 4.2). 
Specific PD interaction studies have not been conducted which is acceptable. The probability of secondary 
effects of gilteritinib related to targets that are not tyrosine kinases is considered to be low. Concomitant 
use  of other medicinal products targeting FLT3  and/or ALK, is also considered unlikely  in view of the 
approved indications.  
In  rats,  decreased  urination  at  30  mg/kg  and  higher  and  decreased  defecation  at  100  mg/kg  were 
observed. In dogs, positive faecal occult blood at 10 mg/kg and higher, a decrease in the blood calcium 
concentration at 30 mg/kg, and salivation and an increase followed by a decrease in the blood calcium 
concentration at 100 mg/kg were observed. These changes were observed at plasma exposure levels 
similar to or less than clinical exposure levels. A possible clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
(SmPC, section 5.3). 
In patients, QT prolongation was observed, similar to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (Cortes et 
al, 2018). The results of in vitro and in vivo non-clinical studies did however not provide a clear indication 
of a strong potential to prolong QT in humans. Based on the literature reporting, in some cases, 10% to 
20% inhibition of the hERG current can be related to QT prolongation in vivo (Jonker et al [2005] and 
Redfern et al [2003]). Taken together there may be multiple factors contributing to gilteritinib induced 
QT  prolongation  seen  in  patients,  such  as  a  weak  hERG  current  suppression  and  increased  CaV1.2 
current.  
Long  half-lifes  in  dogs  and  patients  support  gilteritinib  administration  once  daily.  The  very  wide 
distribution  of  gilteritinib  in  rats  suggests  a  potential  for  gilteritinib  related  adverse  effects  across  all 
tissues and organs, including the CNS. Long retention in pigmented skin and eyes indicates binding to 
melanin. Concern for phototoxicity in patients was however resolved by the negative outcome of the in 
vitro NRU phototoxicity test with Balb/c 3T3 cells. 
All metabolites detected in humans, except for two minor metabolites (M4 and M6), were detected in 
rats and/or dogs (species chosen for toxicity testing). The major excretion route in rats and dogs was 
faeces, which is similar to the excretion pattern in patients. 
In the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, target organs of toxicity were the gastrointestinal 
tract  (heamorrhage  in  dogs),  lymphohaematopoietic  system  (lymphocyte  necrosis  and  bone  marrow 
hypocellularity with changes in haematological parameters), eye (inflammation and lens opacity in rats, 
fundus colour change in dogs, retinal vacuolation), lung (interstitial pneumonia in rats and inflammation 
in dogs), kidney (renal tubule changes with a positive urine occult blood reaction) and liver (hepatocyte 
vacuolation),  urinary  bladder  (epithelial  vacuolation),  epithelial  tissue  (ulcer  and  inflammation),  and 
phospholipidosis  (lung  and  kidney  in  rats).  These  changes  were  observed  at  plasma  exposure  levels 
similar to or less than clinical exposure levels. Reversibility of most of the changes was indicated by the 
end of the 4 week recovery period. A possible clinical relevance of these findings is unknown (SmPC, 
section 5.3). 
GI effects in dogs treated for 4 and 13 weeks showed full or partial recovery except for inflammation in 
molar and incisor alveoli and gingiva, and were considered by the applicant to be associated with the GI 
disorder or liver toxicity observed in the 13-week study. The GI tract is a target organ of toxicity and 
GI-related effects have been observed in patients (some cases of bleeding, perforation and obstruction). 
Diarrhoea, nausea and constipation are described as very common adverse drug reactions in the SmPC.  
The  lung  effects  in  animals  were  noted  at  low  exposure  levels  when  comparing  to  clinical  relevant 
exposure. Phospholipidosis in rat is however considered to be caused by a common structural feature of 
gilteritinib  as  a  cationic  amphiphilic  drug.  Oedema,  haemorrhage  and  congestion  in  the  lungs  in  rats 
were  likely  non-specific  findings  associated  with  a  deteriorated  general  condition  observed  following 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019

administration of gilteritinib at a lethal dose. Lung findings in dogs were severe and have also observed 
in  dogs  treated  with  midostaurin.  Taken  together,  the  lung  findings  in  dogs  are  considered  clinically 
relevant as they may predict toxicity mediated by FLT3 inhibition. The concern for lung effects in patients 
has  not  been  weakened  by  clinical  safety  data,  because  of  lung  toxicity  findings  seen  in  patients. 
Nevertheless, toxicity is monitorable and the histopathological changes in the lungs of dogs recovered, 
or tended to recover, during the recovery period.  
Recovery (full or partial) were noted regarding changes in the kidney and liver (except for increases in 
total cholesterol and phospholipids). The liver and kidney/urinary bladder are considered target organs 
of toxicity and clinical relevance of the findings in these organs cannot be excluded. Effects on the liver 
and kidneys have been observed in patients (acute kidney injury, increased enzyme levels). 
Eye effects were observed in the 13-week dog study and were considered reversible, except for fundus 
changes that recovered in all except 1 animal. The eye changes observed in rats and dogs were without 
margin of safety when compared to a therapeutic gilteritinib dose. Distribution of gilteritinib and binding 
to melanin in eyes of rats was detected in biodistribution studies. The eye is considered a target organ 
of toxicity in animals. Retina findings have been observed in patients (retinopathy). 
Taken together, the adverse findings in the lungs, immune system, bone marrow, hematopoietic system, 
epithelial  tissue,  liver,  kidney/urinary  bladder  and GI  tract  seem  to  be  pharmacologically  related  and 
similar  to  observations  from  animal  studies  with  the  FLT3/KIT  inhibitor  midostaurin.  The  mechanism 
behind the eye toxicity findings in rats and dogs is not fully understood. However, the slight lens opacity 
noted  in  rats  were  without  histopathology  and  the  inflammatory  changes  (conjunctivitis  and  uveitis) 
detected in rats could be caused by immunosuppression. The ocular findings in the 4- and 13-week dog 
studies were reversible and without impairment of visual response test or gait test, indicating no serious 
impairment in vision. The potential clinical relevance of these findings therefore seems low. 
Gilteritinib did not induce gene mutation or chromosomal aberrations in vitro. The in vivo micronucleus 
test showed that gilteritinib has a potential to induce micronuclei in mice (SmPC, section 5.3). This is 
acceptable under the conditions of an indication covering treatment of adult patients who have R/R AML. 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed for gilteritinib. This is in line with recommendations in  the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S9, and these studies are not essential to support a 
marketing application for the proposed patient population. 
Since  embryo-fetal  development  toxicities  were  observed  in  rat,  a  confirmatory  reproductive  toxicity 
study in a second species is not warranted (Ref. ICH S9). 
Gilteritinib showed suppressed foetal growth,  and induced embryo foetal deaths and teratogenicity in 
the  embryo  foetal  development  studies  in  rats  at  exposure  levels  similar  to  clinical  exposure  levels. 
Placental transfer of gilteritinib was shown in the rat resulting in transfer of radioactivity to the foetus 
similar to that observed in maternal plasma (SmPC, section 5.3). 
Gilteritinib  was  excreted  into  the  milk  of  lactating  rats  with  milk  concentrations  being  higher  than  in 
maternal plasma. Gilteritinib was distributed through the breast milk to different tissues, except for the 
brain, of suckling rats (SmPC, section 5.3). 
It is unknown whether gilteritinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available animal data 
have shown excretion of gilteritinib and its metabolites in the animal milk of lactating rats and distribution 
to the tissues in infant rats via the milk. A risk to the breast fed children cannot be excluded. Breast 
feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Xospata and for at least two months after the last 
dose (see section 4.6).

In the juvenile toxicity study in rats, the minimum lethal dose level (2.5 mg/kg/day) was much lower 
than that of adult rats (20 mg/kg/day). The  gastrointestinal tract was identified  as one of the target 
organs similar as in adult rats (SmPC, section 5.3). 
The  embryo-foetal  toxicity  effects  were  noted  at  low  exposures  compared  to  the  relevant  clinical 
exposure and are considered clinical relevant.  
Pregnancy testing is recommended for  females of reproductive potential seven days prior to initiating 
Xospata  treatment. Women  of  childbearing  potential  are  recommended to use effective contraception 
(methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) during and up to 6 months after treatment. It is 
unknown whether gilteritinib may reduce  the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore 
women  using  hormonal  contraceptives  should  add  a  barrier  method  of  contraception.    Males  of 
reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 
4 months after the last dose of Xospata (SmPC, sections 4.4 and 4.6). Embryo-fetal lethality, suppressed 
fetal growth, and teratogenicity has been categorized as a potential risk in the  Risk Management Plan 
(RMP) (see RMP). 
The proposed specification for the related impurity is considered adequately qualified from a non-clinical 
point of view. 
Gilteritinib was not phototoxic in the in vitro NRU phototoxicity test with Balb/c 3T3 cells. 
Gilteritinib PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, gilteritinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate. The relevant information 
has been included in the SmPC (sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 5.1, 5.3).

The  gilteritinib  (ASP2215)  hemifumarate  clinical  pharmacology  program  consisted  of 
two 
biopharmaceutic (relative BA and food effect) studies and six clinical pharmacology phase I studies. A 
population pharmacokinetic (popPK) approach was used to characterise the gilteritinib PK, including the 
impact of various extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The popPK dataset was comprised of sparse and intensive 
PK data from healthy volunteers and AML patients in five phase I studies, 1 phase I/II study and 1 phase 
III study. An overview of clinical studies used to characterize the clinical pharmacology of gilteritinib is

tablets 40 mg). 
Absorption  
Following oral administration of gilteritinib, peak plasma concentrations are observed at a median  tmax 
approximately  between  4  and  6  hours  in  healthy  volunteers  and  patients  with  R/R  AML.  Gilteritinib 
undergoes first order absorption with an estimated absorption rate (ka) of 0.43 h 1 with a lag time of 
0.34 hours based on population PK modelling. Median steady state  Cmax is 282.0 ng/mL (coefficient of 
variation (CV)% = 50.8), and area under the plasma concentration curve during 24 hour dosing interval 
(AUC0-24) is 6180 ng·h/mL (CV% = 46.4) after once daily dosing of 120 mg gilteritinib. Steady state 
plasma levels are reached within 15 days of once daily dosing with an approximate 10 fold accumulation 
(SmPC, section 5.2). 
In  healthy  adults,  gilteritinib  Cmax  and  AUC  decreased  by  approximately  26%  and  less  than  10%, 
respectively, when a single 40 mg dose of gilteritinib was co-administered with a high fat meal compared 
to  gilteritinib  exposure  in  fasted  state.  Median  tmax  was  delayed  2  hours  when  gilteritinib  was 
administered with a high-fat meal (SmPC, section 5.2). 
In  healthy  adults,  gilteritinib  Cmax  and  AUC  decreased  by  approximately  26%  and  less  than  10%, 
respectively, when a single 40 mg dose of gilteritinib was co administered with a high fat meal compared 
to  gilteritinib  exposure  in  fasted  state.  Median  tmax  was  delayed  2  hours  when  gilteritinib  was 
administered with a high fat meal. 
Distribution 
In the popPK analysis, the apparent central and peripheral volume of distribution were estimated to be 
1092 L and 1100 L, respectively. Apparent volume of distribution ranged from 3340 L in healthy subjects 
with normal hepatic function to 5090 L in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. 
The plasma protein binding of gilteritinib in humans was 90.5% and concentration independent within 
the concentration range investigated in vitro (0.1-10 µg/mL). The major binding protein appears to be 
human serum ALB. Mean unbound fraction in healthy individuals with normal hepatic function was 0.057, 
and  an  increase  in  the  unbound  fraction  was  observed  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic 
impairment. 
In the mass balance study (120-240 mg single dose), the blood-to-plasma ratios ranged from 0.85 to 
1.36,  indicating  limited  penetration  of  gilteritinib  into  red  blood  cells.  A  concentration  dependency  is 
indicated by the higher ratio observed at the 240 mg dose. 
Tissue distribution has not been investigated in humans. Animal data indicate a wide distribution to and 
retention in different organs, including the brain and bone marrow. 
Elimination 
In the popPK analysis gilteritinib plasma concentrations declined in a bi-exponential manner with a half-
life of 113 hours. The estimated apparent clearance (CL/F) was 14.85 L/h. Gilteritinib clearance is 46% 
greater in healthy volunteers compared to patients with AML based on the final covariate model. The 
main elimination route was hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 enzyme and excretion of metabolites and 
unchanged substance in both urine and faeces. 
In vitro studies investigating metabolite formation in various species (mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, humans) 
indicated  that  no  major  human-specific  gilteritinib  metabolites  were  formed  by  liver  microsomes  or 
hepatocytes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 41/126 
 
  
 
In vitro, gilteritinib is metabolised by CYP3A4 with one metabolite accounting for approximately 1/3 of 
CYP3A4  metabolism,  while  other  metabolites  each  accounted  for  less  than  4.8%  of  metabolism.  The 
identity of the metabolites has not been specified. Metabolism by other CYP enzymes (1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A5) was negligible.  
In vivo, gilteritinib was extensively metabolised with 14 metabolites (M1, M4, M7-17) detected in plasma 
in the mass balance study. Several metabolites (M1-17, one unknown) were also detected both in urine 
and  in  faeces.  No  single  metabolite  in  urine  or  faeces  accounted  for  >2%  or  >10%,  respectively,  of 
administered dose. Up to ~16% (6.3-15.8%) and 24% (11.7-23.8%) of administered dose was found 
as unchanged substance in urine and faeces, respectively, after 336h. 
The postulated metabolic pathways involve at least oxidation, N-dealkylation, glutathione conjugation 
and glucuronidation. No major inter-individual differences in metabolites were observed in humans. The 
three metabolites in plasma that were quantified are formed by N-dealkylation (M10 [AS2651096] and 
M16 [AS3322943]) and N-dealkylation and oxidation (M17 [AS3397391]). 
The PK of gilteritinib and the routes of excretion and the extent of metabolism following administration 
of a single oral dose of [14C]-gilteritinib after repeated doses of gilteritinib tablets was investigated in 
four evaluable patients with advanced solid tumours. 
The  overall  mean  recovery  of  radioactivity  in  urine,  faeces  and  toilet  tissue  samples  was  80.9% 
(interpolated to 91.3%) over the 768-hour collection period. A mean of 64.5% (interpolated to 73.4%) 
and 16.4% (interpolated to 17.9%) were recovered in faeces and urine, respectively. Up to ~13% of the 
administered dose was excreted in urine as unchanged gilteritinib. Three (M10, M16, M17) of the fourteen 
identified metabolites in plasma were quantified. Mean exposure (AUC24) of these metabolites at steady 
state was less than 10% that of parent substance. Total radioactivity half-life in plasma was comparable 
to gilteritinib half-life. Clinical data on metabolite PK were obtained only in the mass balance study. 
In healthy adults, mean Cmax (%CV) were 21.6 ng/mL (21.4) and 30.4 ng/mL (38.1) and AUCinf (%CV) 
were 1800 ng*h/mL (17.3) and 1970 ng*h/mL (30.8) in the fed and fasted group, respectively. 
Absorption was delayed (2-hour increase in median tmax) when gilteritinib was administered with a 
high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions. Gilteritinib t1/2, CL/F and VZ/F were comparable in the 
fasted and fed treatment groups. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A slightly more-than dose proportional increase in exposure (Cmax and AUC24) at multiple dosing in R/R 
AML  patients  were  observed,  with  a  slope  estimate  of  1.21  (1.02,  1.41)  and  1.22  (1.00,  1.43), 
respectively when all data in the dose range 20-450 mg was considered (study 2215-CL-0101). Similar 
findings were observed in Japanese R/R AML patients over the 20 to mg 200 mg dose interval.

Table 12. Statistical assessment of gilteritinib dose proportionality in patients with relapsed 
or refractory AML – PK Analysis Set, study 2215-CL-0101  
Extensive accumulation of gilteritinib up to ~10-fold (range 3.29-9.64) was observed in R/R AML patients 
following repeated doses once daily (QD) of gilteritinib compared to single dose administration (C1D1 vs 
C1D15, study 2215-CL-0101). Up to 8-fold accumulation was observed in Japanese R/R AMPL patients 
(C1D1 vs. C1D28, study 2215-CL-0102). Steady state was reached after 15 days of once daily dosing. 
Special populations 
A  popPK  analysis  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  covariates  on  the 
predicted exposure of gilteritinib in patients with R/R AML (SmPC, section 5.2).

The effect of hepatic impairment on gilteritinib PK was studied in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class 
A) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Gilteritinib has not been studied in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Table 13. Statistical analysis of hepatic impairment on total and unbound gilteritinib PK – PK 
Analysis Set, study 2215-CL-0106  
A dedicated renal impairment study has not been conducted to assess of the effect of renal impairment 
on gilteritinib PK (SmPC, section 5.2). The popPK model included serum creatinine, a marker of renal 
function, as a statistically significant covariate, but the impact on gilteritinib exposure was less than 2-
fold and less than 1.5-fold different in non-Japanese and Japanese patients with R/R AML, respectively. 
The effect of severe renal impairment on gilteritinib exposure has not been investigated (SmpC section 
4.2). 
A population PK analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic covariates on 
the predicted exposure of gilteritinib in patients with R/R AML. In the population PK analysis age and 
body weight were identified as statistically significant covariates. An overview of studies in the elderly 
population is displayed in Table 14.

In vivo  
In Study 2215-CL-0101 the effect of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the PK of gilteritinib has 
been  evaluated.  This  study  also  evaluated  the  potential  induction  of  CYP3A4  by  gilteritinib  through 
assessment of midazolam PK and the effect of gilteritinib on MATE1 substrates through assessment of 
cephalexin PK. 
An exploratory analysis of the effect of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on gilteritinib exposure 
was performed. Approximately 70% of enrolled patients in the current study required co-administration 
of strong (voriconazole or posaconazole) or moderate fluconazole FLZ CYP3A4 inhibitors.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Gilteritinib  inhibits  FLT3  receptor  signalling  and  proliferation  in  cells  exogenously  expressing  FLT3 
including  FLT3  ITD,  FLT3  D835Y,  and  FLT3  ITD  D835Y,  and  it  induced  apoptosis  in  leukemic  cells 
expressing FLT3 ITD (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Relationship between gilteritinib exposure and FLT3 phosphorylation in relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML 
patients  
The  effect  of  gilteritinib  fumarate  on  FLT3  phosphorylation  was  assessed  using  an  ex-vivo  PIA  assay 
described by Levis et al. (5). In this PIA assay plasma samples were incubated with Ba/F3 or TF-1 cells 
transfected with an expression vector containing the ITD-mutated FLT3 coding sequence. Cell lysates 
were analyzed for FLT3 using immunoprecipitation and antiphophotyrosine immunoblotting was used to 
detect tyrosine kinase substrates. Densitometry was performed on the immunoblot bands. Inhibition of 
FLT3 phosphorylation for plasma samples at each time point was calculated by expressing the density of 
the corresponding band as a percent decrease from the density of the baseline (pretreatment plasma 
sample) band, which was arbitrarily set at 100%. A total of 233 patients were included in the PD analysis 
set.  Assessment  of  the  relationship  between  gilteritinib  concentration  and  inhibition  of  FLT3 
phosphorylation  showed  a  good  correlation.  The  time-matched  data  were  characterized  using  a 
maximum inhibitory effect (Imax) model. Final model parameters are summarized in Table 19. 
Table  19. Final model parameter estimates characterizing inhibitory effect of gilteritinib on 
phosphorylation of FLT3 (2215-CL-0101) 
A dose-related increase in inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was observed across doses ranging from 
20 to 450 mg. More than 90% inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was observed by cycle 1 day 8 predose 
at gilteritinib doses of ≥ 80 mg.  
Minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation 
The  MRD  analysis  was  performed  retrospectively  on  patients  at  any  dose  level  who  were  FLT3-ITD 
positive by central testing at screening/baseline, and had a bone marrow aspirate sample available at 
baseline/screening and at least one post-baseline time point. Presence or absence of MRD was measured 
by  a  FLT3-ITD  signal  ratio  defined  as  the  ratio  of  FLT3-ITD  to  total  FLT3.  A  molecular  response  was 
defined  as  an  FLT3-ITD  signal  ratio  of  ≤  0.01  at  any  post  baseline  time  point,  and  deep  molecular 
response was defined as an FLT-ITD signal ratio ≤ 0.0001.  
Overall, 108 patients were eligible for MRD analysis; 95 patients at doses of ≥ 80 mg and 13 patients at 
doses  <  80  mg.  21  patients  had  a  molecular  response  (ratio  FLT3-ITD:total  FLT3  ≤  0.1  at  any  post 
baseline time point), all at doses of ≥ 80 mg. In patients who received doses of ≥ 80 mg, 58.3% (14/24)

of patients who achieved CR/CRh had a molecular response, while 9.9% (7/71) of patients who did not 
achieve CR/CRh had a molecular response. The CR/CRh rate was 66.7% in patients with a molecular 
response compared to 13.5% in patients without a molecular response.  In patients who received doses 
of  ≥  80 mg,  41.7% (10/24) of patients who  achieved  CR/CRh  had  a deep molecular response, while 
4.2% (3/71) of patients who did not achieve CR/CRh had a deep molecular response. The CR/CRh rate 
was  76.9%  in  patients  with  deep  molecular  response,  compared  to  17.1%  in  patients  without  deep 
molecular response. 
AXL, c-CBL and FLT3 Mutational Analysis 
All exons of AXL, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase C-CBL (c-CBL) and FLT3 were sequenced using a capture 
based NGS assay (data not shown). Due to small number of patients, results from AXL, c-CBL and FLT3 
(other than D835) mutational analysis does not allow any conclusion on response to gilteritinib. 
Exposure response (ER) analysis – efficacy (2215-PK-0008) 
The objective of the study was to  explore PK/PD relationships between estimated gilteritinib exposure 
(AUC24,ss,  Cmin,ss  and  Cmax,ss)  and  clinical  response  (CR/CRh)  in  those  patients  that  were  considered 
clinically  evaluable  in  studies  0301  and  0101,  and  to  explore  PK/PD  relationships  between  estimated 
gilteritinib exposure (AUC24,ss and Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss) and OS in those patients that were considered clinically 
evaluable in study 0301. No exposure-efficacy relationship could be characterised at the exposure range 
studied. 
In the multiple dose study 0101, mean (SD) AUC24 was 31428 (21412) ng*h/mL and mean Cmax was 
1462 (815.1) ng/mL at the maximum clinical dose of 200 mg QD for 15 days (N=2). Mean (SD) AUC24 
and mean (SD) Cmax for the 120 mg dose QD for 15 days were 6943 (3221) ng*h/mL and 374.2 (190.1) 
ng/mL, respectively (N=3). 
In the multiple dose study 0102, mean (SD) AUC24 was 21573.86 (6230.86) ng*h/mL and mean Cmax 
was 1016.28 (295.23) ng/mL at the maximum clinical dose of 200 mg QD for 28 days (N=5). Mean (SD) 
AUC24 and mean (SD) Cmax for the 120 mg dose QD for 28 days were 13463.35 (NA) ng*h/mL and 
680.23 (NA) ng/mL, respectively (N=2). 
Concentration-safety analysis based on integrated data 
A merged gilteritinib concentration - dCK, dAST, dALT, dALB and dQTcF data set was prepared based on 
the data from studies 0101 (Data cut off 07.03.2018), 0102 and 0301 (Data cut off 17.09.2018).  
The dataset for hematological and QTc analysis consisted of 497 and 487 subjects, respectively. Although 
large  variability  was  observed,  the  box  plot  showed  the  dependency  of  safety  data  on  gilteritinib 
concentration. Statistical significant trends towards increasing levels of ALT, AST, creatinine kinase (CK) 
and QTc and decreasing levels of ALB with increasing gilteritinib concentrations were shown. 
The prediction (upper 1-sided 95%CI) at the 120-mg dose (median Cmax 282 ng/mL) was 107 U/L (116 
U/L) in ΔCK, 15.2 U/L (16.6 U/L) in ΔAST and 18.9 U/L (21.1 U/L) in ΔALT. The prediction of ΔALB was 
-0.327 g/L (lower 1-sided 95% CI: -0.634 g/L). 
The  QTc  relationship  was  described  by  an  maximal  effective  concentration  (Emax)vmodel.  The 
prolongation at the 120 mg dose (median Cmax 282 ng/mL) was 4.96 msec (upper 1-sided 95%CI: 6.20 
msec), which did not reach the 10-msec threshold for regulatory significance. The predicted change in 
the fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) from baseline at the median Cmax,ss associated with once-daily 
doses of 200 mg gilteritinib is 9.93 msec with an upper 95% confidence limit of 12.5 msec. Covariate 
models on QTc were developed (covariates race, CYP3A4 inhibitors, baseline QTc) revealing only impact 
of baseline QTc. Patients who had longer baseline QTcF intervals showed smaller ΔQTcF with increasing 
gilteritinib concentration.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  population  estimate  of  central  and  peripheral  volume  of  distribution  was  1092  L  and  1100  L, 
respectively. These data indicate gilteritinib distributes extensively outside of plasma, which may indicate 
extensive  tissue  distribution.  In  vivo  plasma  protein  binding  in  humans  is  approximately  90%  and 
gilteritinib is primarily bound to ALB (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Based  on  in  vitro  data,  gilteritinib  is  primarily  metabolised  via  CYP3A4.  The  primary  metabolites  in 
humans  include  M17  (formed  via  N  -dealkylation  and  oxidation),  M16  and  M10  (both  formed  via  N  
dealkylation) and were observed in animals. None of these three metabolites exceeded 10% of overall 
parent  exposure.  The  pharmacological  activity  of  the  metabolites  against  FLT3  and  AXL  receptors  is 
unknown (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Absolute  bioavailability  is  not  known.  After  a  single  dose  of  [14C]  gilteritinib,  gilteritinib  is  primarily 
excreted in faeces with 64.5% of the total administered dose recovered in faeces. Approximately 16.4% 
of  the  total  dose  was  excreted  in  urine  as  unchanged  drug  and  metabolites.  Gilteritinib  plasma 
concentrations declined in a bi exponential manner with a population mean estimated half-life of 113 
hours. The estimated CL/F based on the population PK model is 14.85 L/h (SmPC, section 5.2). 
In  healthy  adults,  gilteritinib  Cmax  and  AUC  decreased  by  approximately  26%  and  less  than  10%, 
respectively, when a single 40 mg dose of gilteritinib was co administered with a high fat meal compared 
to  gilteritinib  exposure  in  fasted  state.  Median  tmax  was  delayed  2  hours  when  gilteritinib  was 
administered with a high fat meal (SmPC, section 5.2).The tablets can be taken with or without food 
(SmPC, section 4.2). 
In  general,  gilteritinib  exhibited  linear,  dose  -proportional  PK  after  single  and  multiple  dose 
administration at doses ranging from 20 to 450 mg in patients with R/R AML (SmPC, section 5.2). 
The effect of hepatic impairment on gilteritinib PK was studied in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class 
A) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.  
Following  a  10  mg  single  oral  dose  of  gilteritinib  in  the  dedicated  hepatic  impairment  study  AUCinf 
decreased by 22% and 35% in the mild and moderate group, respectively, and mean Cmax decreased by 
14%  in  the  moderate  group  compared  to  the  normal  group.  Both  CL/F  and  the  apparent  volume  of 
distribution during the terminal elimination phase (Vz/F) increased with increasing severity of hepatic 
impairment, while t1/2 was comparable across groups. Unbound gilteritinib exposure in subjects in the 
mild or moderate hepatic impairment groups was comparable to that observed in subjects in the normal 
hepatic function group.  
Results indicate unbound gilteritinib exposure in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment is 
comparable  to  that  observed  in  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function.  The  effect  of  mild  hepatic 
impairment [as defined by the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG)] 
on gilteritinib exposure was also assessed using the population PK model and the  results demonstrate 
little difference in predicted steady-state gilteritinib exposure relative to a typical patient with R/R AML 
and normal liver function (SmPC, section 5.2). 
The effect of mild or moderate renal impairment was evaluated using  a popPK model. Serum creatinine, 
a marker of renal function, was identified as a statistically significant covariate. However, the predicted 
increase on gilteritinib  exposure was less than 2  fold  Impaired  renal function  is thus not expected to 
significantly affect gilteritinib exposure, indicating dose adjustment is not warranted in patients with mild 
or  moderate  renal impairment.  The  CHMP  recommended  the  applicant  to  conduct  a  phase  I  study  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 50/126 
 
  
 
investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of gilteritinib 
compared to subjects with normal renal function (see RMP). 
In vitro investigations indicated that gilteritinib was not a substrate of hepatic transporters OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3 or OCT1, however the data are  not  conclusive as only  one, relatively  high  concentration of 
gilteritinib  was  used.  According  to  the  EMA  DDI  guideline,  hepatic  uptake  transporters  OATP1B1  and 
OATP1B3 should be investigated for substances where hepatic metabolism accounts for ≥25% of total 
elimination. Additionally, gilteritinib was not found to be a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP),  however  the  study  should  be  repeated  using  four  concentrations  0.01-1-fold  the  therapeutic 
dose/250  mL  in  accordance  with  the  EMA  DDI  guideline.  The  CHMP  recommended  the  applicant  to 
conduct an in vitro study post-approval, designed to investigate gilteritinib as a substrate of BCRP and 
hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1. 
Concomitant use of Xospata with strong CYP3A/P glycoprotein (gp) inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin 
and St. John’s Wort) should be avoided because they can decrease gilteritinib plasma concentrations. In 
healthy subjects, co administration of RIF (600 mg), a strong CYP3A/P gp inducer, to steady state with 
a single 20 mg dose of gilteritinib decreased gilteritinib mean Cmax by 27% and mean AUCinf by 70%, 
respectively, compared to subjects administered a single dose of gilteritinib alone (SmPC sections 4.4, 
4.5). 
Strong  inhibitors  of  CYP3A  and/or  P  gp  (e.g.,  voriconazole,  ITZ,  posaconazole,  clarithromycin, 
erythromycin,  captopril,  carvedilol,  ritonavir,  azithromycin)  can 
increase  gilteritinib  plasma 
concentrations. A single, 10 mg dose of gilteritinib co administered with ITZ (200 mg once daily for 28 
days), a strong CYP3A and/or P gp inhibitor, to healthy subjects resulted in an approximate 20% increase 
in  mean  Cmax  and  2.2  fold  increase  in  mean  AUCinf  relative  to  subjects  administered  a  single  dose  of 
gilteritinib alone. Gilteritinib exposure increased approximately 1.5 fold in patients with R/R AML when 
co administered with a strong CYP3A and/or P gp inhibitor (SmpC sections 4.4, 4.5). 
Gilteritinib is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4 or and inhibitor of MATE1 in vivo. The PK of midazolam 
(a  sensitive  CYP3A4  substrate)  were  not  significantly  (Cmax  and  AUC  increased  approximately  10%) 
affected after once daily administration of gilteritinib (300 mg) for 15 days in patients with FLT3 mutated 
R/R AML. Additionally, the PK of cephalexin (a sensitive MATE1 substrate) were not significantly (Cmax 
and AUC decreased by less than 10%) affected after once daily administration of gilteritinib (200 mg) 
for 15 days in patients with FLT3 mutated R/R AML (SmPC section 4.5). 
There is no data available on the concomitant use of contraceptive steroids. Gilteritinib is considered a 
potential human teratogen and the proposed indication could include females of childbearing potential. 
Appropriate  recommendations  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC  section  4.6  (See  discussion  on  non-
clinical aspects). 
Two separate experimental systems should have been used to investigate P-gp inhibition due to the high 
inter-laboratory  variability  in  the  inhibition  parameter  estimation  for  P-gp,  and  an  additional  study  is 
required. The CHMP recommended the applicant to perform a post-authorization study to investigate the 
potential of gilteritinib to inhibit P-gp and the bile salt export pump (BSEP). 
No exposure-efficacy relationship could be characterised at the exposure range studied. Considering that 
ER analysis conducted on phase III data mainly can be used to identify major deviations in the adequacy 
of the selected dosing regimen either in the target or in subpopulations, this is to be expected. No phase 
II  dose-finding  study  has  been  conducted,  and  the  ER  analysis  has  not  been  prospectively  planned. 
Overall, the ER efficacy analysis is exploratory only, and is insufficient to draw any conclusions on the 
ER relationship or to support the proposed dose regimen. 
There  was  a  tendency  for  increasing  QTc  prolongation  with  increasing  gilteritinib  exposures.  At  the 
median Cmax,ss associated with the proposed dose of 200 mg QD, the upper bound of the predicted change

in QTcF was 12.5 msec. Thus an increased risk of QTc prolongation at the 200 mg dose of  gilteritinib 
cannot be ruled out (see discussion on clinical safety). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK and PD of gilteritinib have been reasonably well investigated. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study 2215-CL-0101 
No formal dose-finding study was conducted. 
The dose-escalating study 2215-CL-0101, was a phase 1/2 open-label, first-in-human study in patients 
with R/R AML, with concomitant expansion cohort for multiple doses.  
The  primary  objectives  of  this  phase  1/2  study  were  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability,  including 
determination of the MTD of oral gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or treatment-refractory AML, and 
to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of gilteritinib.  
The secondary objectives of the study were to investigate the antileukemic activity of various doses of 
gilteritinib in patients with AML and to evaluate the effect of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on 
the PK of gilteritinib (see section ‘‘Pharmacokinetic interaction studies’’). 
The study consisted of two cohorts:  
•  Cohort 1 - the initial dose escalation cohort, with up to 10 dose levels. Dose levels were set at 
around 50% increments. Cohort 1 was designed to determine the MTD based on assessment of 
DLTs at each dose level; 
•  Cohort 2 – the dose expansion cohort. Cohort 2 was conducted to further explore expanded dose 
levels. 
Twenty-five patients were allocated to treatment for the dose escalation phase and an additional 240 
randomized to the dose expansion phase, which includes 5 patients who were re-enrolled into the study. 
The doses assessed 20, 40, 80, 120, 200, 300 and 450 mg/day.  The starting dose level of gilteritinib 
was  20  mg  daily,  and  the  decision  to  dose  escalate  to  the  next  dose  level  was  made  based  on  the 
assessment of safety variables, including occurrence of grade 2 adverse events (AEs) or DLTs. The DLT 
observation period was 30 days starting with the first dose taken on day -2 and including the first 28-
day treatment cycle. 
Efficacy  endpoints  included  best  response  including  CR  rate,  CRc  rate  and  response  (CRc  +  partial 
remission [PR]) rate, CRh; duration of remission; OS; EFS and LFS.   
The study initiation date (Date of First Enrolment) was 9 October 2013 and the study completion date 
(Date of Last Evaluation) was 7 March 2018. 
Median age was 62.0 years. Overall, the duration of AML ranged from less than 1 month to 132.7 months, 
with a median duration of 9.07 months.  Overall, 70.6% (178/252) of patients in the SAF were FTL3-
ITD  mutation  positive  and  13.1%  (33/252)  were  FLT3-TKD  positive  by  local  testing,  with  23.0%  of 
patients  (58/252)  testing  as  FLT3  mutation  negative.  Previous  line  of  AML  therapies  were  1-3  where 
44% (111/252) had received >3 lines, 26.2% (66/252) 2 lines and 29.8% (75/252) 1 line. The most 
common recurrent genetic abnormalities (WHO Classification) were AML with mutated NPM1 (27.0%, 
68/252), AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (17.1%, 43/252), acute myelomonocytic leukaemia 
Assessment report

(11.1%, 28/252), AML without maturation (9.1%, 23/252), AML with maturation (7.5%, 19/252) and 
AML  minimally  differentiated  (6.3%,  16/252);  no  other  classification  occurred  in  more  than  5%  of 
patients.        A  majority  of  patients  were  characterized  with  intermediate  cytogenetic  risk  (56.7%, 
143/252),  with  intermediate:  normal  being  the  single  most  common  characterization  (122  patients, 
48.4%);  22.2%  of  patients  were  characterized  with  unfavorable  cytogenetic  risk  (56/252)  and  2.8% 
were characterized with favorable cytogenetic risk (7/252).  
The MTD established in Study 2215-CL-0101, based on DLTs  was 300 mg daily.  PD analyses showed 
that  gilteritinib  exhibited  rapid  and  sustained  inhibition  of  FLT3  phosphorylation  at  doses  ≥  80  mg. 
Similarly, in FLT3 mutation positive patients, the CRc rates at end of treatment were generally low for 
patients randomized to the 20-mg and 40-mg dose groups (< 10%) and generally similar for patients 
randomized to the 80 mg (41.7%), 120 mg (46.4%) and 200 mg (40.4%) dose groups. 
Response was assessed based on central assessment supplemented by local assessment (i.e., derived 
response) and investigator-reported response.  Patients are included in the dose group of the initial dose 
received prior to any dose increase or decrease, unless otherwise noted.  Based on the derived response 
at end of treatment in the FLT3 mutation positive patients (local FLT3 testing,  full analysis set (FAS)) 
including all doses, 71 patients achieved CRc for a CRc rate of 37.2%, and the best overall response rate 
(i.e., CRc + PR) was 48.7%. 
The CR, CRh, and CR/CRh rates were also assessed per dose group.  The dose expansions for the 20 
and 40 mg dose levels were closed early  due  to insufficient efficacy; as a result, efficacy evaluations 
were focused on the 80, 120, 200 and 300 mg dose groups. When analyzed by original planned doses, 
the derived CRc rate in the 80-, 120-, 200- and 300-mg dose groups was 41.7%, 46.4%, 40.4% and 
30.0%,  respectively,  and  the  best  overall    response  rate  was  66.7%,  53.6%,  48.3%  and  60.0%, 
respectively.  
The CR rate for FLT3 mutation positive patients receiving 120 mg was 12.5%.  The derived CRh rate for 
FLT3  mutation  positive  patients  receiving  120  mg  was  10.7%  and  the  CR/CRh  rate  was  23.2%.The 
median duration of CRc in FLT3 mutation positive patients in ≥ 80-mg dose groups was 147.0 days (95% 
CI: 97.0, 307.0).  Median time to best response was 56.0 days, ranging from 26 to 364 days.   
For the population of FLT3 mutation positive patients, the median OS from Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates 
for dose groups ≥ 80 mg gilteritinib was 218.0 days.  The survival probability was 85.7% at 8 weeks, 
56.2% at 26 weeks, and 24.9% at 1 year.

Study 2215 –CL-0102 
This was a phase 1 one open-label dose-escalation study in Japanese patients with R/R AML. 27 patients 
were randomised and 24 received study medication with gilteritinib in doses from 20 to 300 mg.  The 
starting dose level was 20 mg daily. Gilteritinib was to be administered in at least 1 patient at the 20-
mg dose level and at least 3 patients at the subsequent dose levels (40, 80, 120, 200 and 300 mg).  
Patients who had received gilteritinib in a certain dose level were not assigned to another dose level.  
The DLT observation period was 30 days starting with the first dose in cycle 0 (day  -2) and including 
cycle 1 (the first 28-day treatment cycle).  
The best overall response was stratified by central FLT3 mutation status.  At end of treatment, in the 5 
FLT3 mutation-positive patients, 3 patients achieved CRc with a CRc rate of 60.0% (95% CI: 14.7%, 
94.7%) and the response rate was 80.0% (95% CI: 28.4%, 99.5%).  In the FLT3 mutation-negative 
patients, the CRc rate and the response rate were 27.3% (95% CI: 6.0%, 61.0%) and 36.4% (95% CI: 
10.9%, 69.2%), respectively (data not shown). 
Dose escalation to 200mg 
Efficacy 
A comparison of response rates during cycle 1 compared to best overall response for patients in Study 
2215-CL-0301 who did not escalate to gilteritinib 200 mg per day showed that composite complete 
remission (CRc) and complete remission (CR) rates were higher in the best overall response compared 
to the cycle 1 best response (overall CRc rate was 58.9% versus 33.3% for the CRc rate following 1 
cycle of treatment; overall CR rate was 24.4% versus 5.4% for the CR rate following 1 cycle of 
treatment), suggesting that patients benefit from a prolonged exposure to gilteritinib and not all 
patients who will respond to gilteritinib will reach CR or CRc during the first treatment cycle.

When analysing best overall response in the group of patients who did not respond after cycle 1, the 
difference in CRc rates between patients who were not escalated to gilteritinib 200 mg per day and 
those who were escalated to gilteritinib 200 mg per day was small (38.4% vs 40.3%).

Treatments 
Subjects were randomized to receive either gilteritinib (staring dose 120 mg administered orally once 
daily) or salvage chemotherapy administered sc [LoDAC] or azacitidine or iv [MEC and FLAG-IDA]). A 
study flow chart is provided in Figure 4. 
Figure 4 Study Design 2215-CL-0301 
1º: primary; AML: acute myeloid leukemia; FLT3: FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3; FLAG-IDA: fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor with idarubicin; MEC: mitoxantrone, etoposide and intermediate-dose cytarabine; NR: no response; PD: 
progressive disease.

Gilteritinib tablets were administered orally once daily in continuous 28-day cycles.  The starting dose 
was 120 mg per day (3 tablets of 40 mg), which could be titrated per protocol instructions.  Subjects 
receiving gilteritinib treatment should continue until there was no longer clinical benefit from therapy, 
until unacceptable toxicity occurred or another discontinuation criterion was met.  
Interruption, reduction or escalation in dose of gilteritinib 
Dose reductions/interruptions were based on the following criteria: QTcF prolongation, retinopathy, non-
hematologic  toxicity  (Grade  3  or  4),  or  myelosuppression.  Additionally,  dosing  may  have  been 
interrupted  or  reduced  at  the  investigators  discretion  if  deemed  necessary  for  safety  reasons.  The 
gilteritinib dose may be initially reduced to 80 mg per day, and could be further reduced to 40 mg per 
day if the patient had already experienced clinical benefit. No further dose reductions were allowed (i.e., 
if a patient was receiving gilteritinib 40 mg and further dose reduction was required, study treatment 
was discontinued). If the gilteritinib dose was reduced, it was not re-escalated. 
Any patients that were off treatment for more than 14 days, other than for HSCT, could only resume 
treatment after discussion with the medical monitor.  Dose escalations to 200 mg per day were allowed 
in patients on a dose of 120 mg per day who did not achieve a CRc (CR, CRp or CRi) during or after cycle 
1, based on bone marrow and hematology results. No further dose escalation was allowed. 
Resumption of Treatment After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation 
Gilteritinib could be resumed after HSCT if the following conditions were met: 
Subject was between 30 - 90 days post HSCT; Subject had successful engraftment as demonstrated by 
ANC  ≥  500/mm3  and  platelets  ≥  20000/mm3  without  transfusions;  Subject  did  not  have  ≥  grade 2 
acute GVHD; Subject was in CRc. 
Salvage Chemotherapy: 
The investigator pre-selected the specific salvage chemotherapy regimen before randomization of each 
subject.  All  regimens  were  administered  as  28-day  cycles  and  per  institutional  guidelines  for 
chemotherapy  product  preparation/administration1.  Options  for  comparative  salvage  chemotherapies 
were limited to the following (all dose levels as defined below must have been followed): 
Low intensity chemotherapy 
LoDAC (Burnett et al. (8)):  20 mg cytarabine was administered twice daily by sc or intravenous (iv) 
injection for 10 days.  
Azacitidine (Itzykson et al. (9)):  75 mg/m2 azacitidine was administered daily by sc or iv injection for 7 
days.  
Institutional guidelines were followed if dose reduction was needed after cycle 1. 
Patients who received LoDAC or azacitidine treatment should have continued until meeting a treatment 
discontinuation criterion. 
High intensity chemotherapy  
MEC Induction Chemotherapy (Levis et al. (10)): 
• 
• 
• 
Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 1 through 5). 
Etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 1 through 5). 
Cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 1 through 5). 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 63/126 
 
  
 
 
 
FLAG-IDA Induction Chemotherapy (Parker et al., Pallis et al. (11, 12)) : 
• 
G-CSF 300 µg/m2 per day was administered by sc/iv for 5 days (days 1 through 5).  Additional 
G-CSF by sc/iv was recommended 7 days after completing chemotherapy until absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) > 0.5 X 109/L. 
• 
• 
• 
Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 2 through 6). 
Cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 5 days (days 2 through 6). 
Idarubicin 10 mg/m2 per day was administered by iv for 3 days (days 2 through 4). 
Patients who received MEC or FLAG-IDA received 1 cycle of therapy and were assessed for response on 
or after day 15, per institutional guidelines.  If the bone marrow cellularity was 20% or greater with at 
least a 50% reduction in blasts, the patient may have received a second cycle of the same chemotherapy.  
If bone marrow cellularity was between 5% and 20%, the investigator made the decision whether the 
patient should have received another treatment cycle or should have been observed for recovery.  If 
bone marrow cellularity was 5% or less, the patient was observed for recovery.  Patients achieving CR, 
CRi or CRp may have received a second cycle of chemotherapy at the investigator’s discretion.   
Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
•  Determine the clinical benefit of gilteritinib in subjects with FLT3-mutated AML who are refractory 
to  or  have  relapsed  after  first-line  AML  therapy  as  shown  with  OS  compared  to  salvage 
chemotherapy. 
•  Determine  the  efficacy  of  gilteritinib  as  assessed  by  the  rate  of  CR  and  CRh  in  subjects  with 
FLT3-mutated  AML  who  are  refractory  to  or  have  relapsed  after  first-line  AML  therapy  (first 
interim analysis).  
Secondary Objectives 
The  key  secondary  objectives  were  to  determine  the  overall  efficacy  in  event-free  survival  (EFS)  of 
gilteritinib  compared  to  salvage  chemotherapy  and  to  determine  the  overall  efficacy  in  CR  rate  of 
gilteritinib compared to salvage chemotherapy. 
Other secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of gilteritinib versus salvage chemotherapy in 
terms  of:  LFS;  Duration  of  remission;  CRh  rate;  CRc  rate;  Transfusion  conversion  rate;  transfusion 
maintenance rate; Transplantation rate; Patient reported fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI]); AEs, 
safety  labs,  vital  signs,  ophthalmologic  exams,  ECGs;  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG) 
performance scores; Evaluation of gilteritinib (and metabolites as appropriate) plasma concentration and 
popPK. 
Exploratory Objectives 
Exploratory objectives included the e valuation of the safety and efficacy of gilteritinib versus salvage 
chemotherapy  in  terms  of  pharmacogenomics  (PGx),  FLT3  gene  mutation  status,  biomarkers  of 
gilteritinib activity, resource utilization and PROs.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
OS was the primary endpoint for the second interim analysis and in the final analysis. OS was defined 
as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. For a subject who is 
not known to have died by the end of study follow-up, OS is censored at the date of last contact.  
In addition, for the first interim analysis, CR/CRh rate was a co-primary endpoint. CR/CRh was defined 
as the number of patients who achieved either CR or CRh at any of the post baseline visits divided by 
the number of patients in the analysis population. 
Key secondary endpoints 
EFS defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of documented relapse (excluding 
relapse after PR), treatment failure or death, within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, whichever 
occurs first.  
Treatment failure includes those patients who discontinued the treatment due to ‘‘progressive disease’’ 
or ‘‘lack of efficacy’’. 
CR rate defined as the number of subjects who achieve the best response of CR divided by the number 
of subjects in the analysis population. 
Relapse after CR, CRh, CRp or CRi is defined as a reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood 
or ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow aspirate not attributable to any other cause or reappearance or new 
appearance of extramedullary leukaemia. 
Relapse after PR is similarly defined with reappearance of significant numbers of peripheral blasts and 
an increase in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspirate to > 25% not attributable to any 
other cause or reappearance or new appearance of extramedullary leukaemia. 
Best response is defined as the best measured response to treatment for all visits (in the order of CR, 
CRp, CRi, PR, not reached (NR) and not evaluable (NE)) post-baseline. 
Other secondary endpoints 
• 
LFS,  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  first  CRc  until  the  date  of  documented  relapse 
(excluding relapse from PR) or death.  For a patient who was not known to have relapsed or died, LFS 
was censored on the date of last relapse-free disease assessment.   
• 
Duration of remission includes duration of CRc, duration of CR/CRh, duration of CRh, duration of 
CR, duration of CRi, duration of CRp and duration of response (CRc + PR). 
o 
Duration of CRc is defined as the time from the date of first CRc until the date of documented 
relapse for subjects who achieve CRc. 
o 
o 
Duration of CR/CRh, CRh, CR, CRp, CRi is defined similarly as duration of CRc. 
Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of either first CRc or PR until the date 
of documented relapse of any type for subjects who achieve CRc or PR.

Sample size 
The  study  utilized  a  group  sequential  design  using  the  O’Brien-Fleming  boundaries  (non-binding)  as 
implemented by Lan-DeMets alpha/beta spending Method. The overall 0.025 one-sided type I error rate 
was allocated by 0.0005 and 0.0245 (corresponding to 0.001 and 0.049 for two-sided type I error rates) 
for the two co-primary efficacy endpoints of CR/CRh and OS, respectively. In subjects randomized into 
ASP2215 only, an arbitrarily selected nominal alpha of 0.0005 was spent, which was not recycled in the 
second interim and final analyses.  
Two interim analyses and one final analysis were planned. The first interim analysis was planned when 
approximately 141 subjects are randomized into ASP2215 arm and at least 112 days (4 treatment cycles) 
post first dose or randomization (for subjects who received no study drug). The second interim analysis 
was  planned  when  approximately  129  death  events  had  occurred  and  the  final  analysis  was  planned 
when approximately 258 death events had occurred.  
Approximately  369  subjects  (the  planned  sample  size  with  10%  dropout  rate)  was  planned  to  be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ASP2215 or salvage chemotherapy (246 subjects in the ASP2215 
treatment arm and 123 subjects in the salvage chemotherapy arm). The planned 258 death events was 
calculated to provide about 90% power to detect a difference in OS between the ASP2215 arm with 7.7 
months  median  survival  time  and  salvage  chemotherapy  arm  with  5  months  median  survival  time 
(hazard ratio (HR) = 0.65) at the overall one-sided 0.0245 significance level.  
The co-primary endpoint of CR/CRh rate was to be evaluated only at the first interim analysis. A sample 
size of 141 subjects was calculated to provides 80% power to exclude a CR/CRh rate of 12% using the 
two-sided 95% exact CI when the CR/CRh rate of ASP2215 is assumed to be 21% (211 subjects in total: 
141  in  the  ASP2215  arm  and  70  in  the  salvage  chemotherapy  arm).  With  a  minimum  follow-up  of  4 
treatment cycles are considered to achieve a maximum width of 15.78% for the two-sided 95% exact 
confidence interval (CI) when the CR/CRh is expected to be in the 5% to 30% range as summarized in 
below table. A sample size of 141 subjects provides 80% power to exclude a CR/CRh rate of 12% using 
the two-sided 95% exact CI when the CR/CRh rate of ASP2215 is assumed to be 21%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 66/126 
 
  
 
The planned sample size with 258 EFS events would provide about 90% power to detect the difference 
in EFS (6 months median EFS for ASP2215 arm and 3.9 months for salvage chemotherapy arm with HR 
= 0.65) and > 90% power to detect a difference in CR rate between ASP2215 (with 25% CR rate) and 
the salvage chemotherapy (with 10% CR rate) at the overall 1-sided 0.0245 significance level.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio via an interactive response technology (IRT) to receive ASP2215 
or salvage chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by response to first-line AML therapy and pre-
selected salvage chemotherapy.  
Prior therapy and response:  Primary refractor without HSCT; Relapse within 6 months after CRc and no 
HSCT ; Relapse within 6 months after allogeneic HSCT; Relapse after 6 months after CRc and no HSCT; 
Relapse after 6 months after allogeneic HSCT.   
Pre-selected  chemotherapy  (preselected  before  randomization 
in  both  arms):  High-intensity 
chemotherapy (MEC; FLAG-IDA); Low-intensity chemotherapy (LoDAC, Azacitidin).  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Primary Hypothesis 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  comparing  OS  in  the  intention  to  treat  (ITT)  population  between 
ASP2215 and the selected salvage chemotherapies had the null and alternative hypotheses:  
H01: OS in ASP2215 is worse or equal to the OS in salvage chemotherapy  
H11: OS in ASP2215 is better than the OS in salvage chemotherapy 
This was tested only at the second interim and final analyses, using the stratified log-rank test (primary 
test) with strata used in randomization to control for response to first-line AML therapy and preselected 
salvage chemotherapy. The HR of the treatment effect along with 95%  CI was calculated by the stratified 
Cox proportional hazard model using the same stratification factors.  
Sensitivity analyses for OS included the same analysis as primary analysis but on FAS or per protocol 
set (PPS), or censoring for HSCT or new  antileukemia therapy, and stratified Cox proportional hazard 
models  with  strata  to  control  for  response  to  first  line  AML  therapy  and  preselected  salvage 
chemotherapy on ITT, and optionally initiation of new antileukemia therapy as a time-dependent binary 
covariate on ITT. An additional sensitivity  analysis,  weighted differences  of Kaplan–Meier curves with 
estimation of difference of Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) and its 95% CI by a pre-specified cut-
off time at 18 months was carried out.  
Further  sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  to  explore  the  impact  of  early  censoring,  predominantly 
affecting the chemotherapy arm (see section on ancillary analyses). Analyses covering both the first 8 
weeks (EC8) (1 vs 10 censorings in the gilteritinib vs chemotherapy arm) and the first 6 months (EC6M) 
(6  vs  15  censorings  in  the  gilteritinib  vs  chemotherapy  arms)  were  performed,  using  “Bootstrap 
resampling” and “Tipping point analysis” (Zhao, et al 2014). 
The  bootstrap  resampling  analysis  was  based  on  a  neutral  assumption  that  the  survival  risk  of  eraly 
censored patients was comparable with the survival risk of patients with non- early censoring (by same 
treatment and stratum).  
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 67/126 
 
  
 
The  tipping  point  analysis  covered  the  same  neutral  scenario  as  the  bootstrap  resampling,  assuming 
equal hazard for imputed and remaining patients (ϴ = 1) (by treatment and strata). In addition, several 
more conservative assumptions were made, i.e. the analysis imputing censoring up to 6 months included 
a  scenario  where  a  3-  fold  decrease    in  survival  risk  was  assumed  for  the  censored  patients  in  the 
gilteritinib  (ϴ  =  3)  arm  combined  with  an  increase  of  survival  risk  in  the  censored  patients  in  the 
chemotherapy arm (ϴ = from 0.1). For this analysis a >85% rejection rate of the null hypothesis with 
ϴ ≥ 0.5 for the chemotherapy arm was reported. 
For the first interim analysis, CR/CRh was a co-primary efficacy endpoint. The two-sided 95% exact  CI 
of CR/CRh rate was planned to be calculated for approximately 141 subjects who were randomized into 
ASP2215 arm and at least 112 days (4 treatment cycles) post first dose, or randomization for subjects 
who received no study drug, i.e. ASP2215 subjects in the response analysis set (RAS). The lower limit 
of the 95% CI was compared to the benchmark CR/CRh rate of 12%.  
Handling of missing data  
For primary endpoint OS, missing or incomplete death date was imputed as the earliest possible date on 
or after the date of last contact compatible with the (partial) information available. Partial relapse dates 
was imputed to the first day of the month of the missing parameter but not earlier than the last disease 
assessment date. A month and year had to be present or the date was to remain missing.  
Missing centrally evaluated bone marrow assessment were imputed with local bone marrow assessment. 
Non-responder imputation was used for binary response variables.  
For  OS  and  EFS  analyses,  if  all  events  were  from  one  treatment  group  in  at  least  one  stratum 
combination, or the Cox proportional hazard model did not converge due to small event size in some 
stratum  combinations,  the  stratum  combinations  were  planned  to  be  pooled  as  needed,  first  by 
successively decreasing the number of levels of response to first-line therapy to three, two and one, and 
secondly by pooling across preselected chemotherapies.

gilteritinib dose interruption or reduction were revised by deleting the requirement for 48 hours duration 
of  Grade  3  AEs  to  interrupt  dosing  and  state  that  treatment  with  gilteritinib  was  interrupted  for  any 
related Grade 3 AE; The definition of transfusion independence was changed from 4 weeks to 1 week 
without red blood cell transfusion and 1 week without platelet transfusion for the CR criterion; No patients

criteria;  12-lead  ECG  and  pharmacokinetic  sampling  was  added  (whole  blood  samples  for  plasma 
pharmacokinetic) to occur on day 8 ± 1 pre-dose; A confirmatory ECG that was to be performed on day 
9 and an investigator assessment to consider a dose reduction for a patient if the mean QTcF for a patient 
from day 1 to day 8 had increased > 30 msec with no other known aetiology was added; The mean QTcF 
of the triplicate ECG tracings based on central reading was clarified to be used for all treatment decisions;

Country-specific Substantial Amendment 3 (Korea) dated 8 October 2015 
Inclusion  criterion  No.  5  was  modified  to  describe the  FLT3  mutation  types as  ITD  alone  or  ITD  with 
concurrent TKD.  
Substantial Amendment 4 dated 9 December 2015 
Clarification that if bone cellularity was between 5% and 20%, the investigator should have determined 
whether  a  patient  should  have  received  another  treatment  cycle  was  provided;  The  description  of 
acceptable contraception methods was changed for females in inclusion Criterion No. 10 and for males 
and their spouse/partners in inclusion Criterion No. 13;  The mean of triplicate QTcF > 450 msec was 
clarified  to  be  cause  for  exclusion  in  Criterion  No.  12  and  the  terminology  for  Long  QT  Syndrome  in 
exclusion Criterion No. 13 was modified. A precaution regarding the use of gilteritinib with concomitant 
medications  that  are  known  to  prolong  QT  or  corrected  QT  interval  (QTc)  was  added  and  further 
instructions were provided to the investigator to check each patient’s concomitant drugs for those that 
might have prolonged QT or QTc interval. A guideline for gilteritinib dose interruption and dose reduction 
if  a  patient  had  a  mean  of  triplicate  QTcF  >  500  msec  was  added;  The  discontinuation  criterion  that 
patients receiving MEC or FLAG-IDA who had NR or progressive disease should have been discontinued 
if it occurred following cycle 1 was clarified. 
Country-Specific Substantial Amendment 5 (Korea) dated 31 March 2016 
Inclusion Criteria No. 10 and No. 13 were clarified to include all highly effective contraception examples 
for females and males and their spouse/partners.  
Country-specific Substantial Amendment 6 (France) dated 22 June 2016 
Language  clarifying  local  requirements  for  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  was  added:  Per  local 
regulations,  patients  must  have  consented  personally,  patients  too  young  or  incapable  of  personal 
consent were excluded, and patients must have participated in a national social security scheme. 
Substantial Amendment 7 dated 8 August 2016 
The long-term follow-up was clarified to be every 3 months for up to 3 years from the patient’s end of 
treatment visit; Midostaurin was included as a permitted prior treatment in exclusion Criterion No. 7; 
Patients with disallowed FLT3 mutation types (exclusion Criterion No. 23) were excluded; patients were 
included on the basis of local laboratory testing for allowed FLT3 mutation types (inclusion Criterion No. 
5). If a subject is enrolled from a local FLT3 test result, the local test must have been performed after 
the subject’s last interventional treatment. A subject’s disease’s clonal architecture or allelic ratio may 
have changed because of treatment and may no longer be FLT3 mutation positive. This could result in a 
negative FLT3 result from the central lab; Exclusion of MATE1 substrates as a concomitant medication 
restriction was deleted. Donor lymphocyte infusion as an allowed concomitant treatment for AML was 
included; Discontinuation criteria were clarified to include language stating that patients were eligible to 
continue  treatment  until  a  discontinuation  criterion  was  met  or  gilteritinib  gained  a  marketing 
authorization  and  became  commercially  available;  HR  in  the  interim  analysis  was  included;  Disease 
assessment  from  bone  marrow  samples  was  clarified  to  only  be  required  for  MEC  and  FLAG-IDA 
treatment per institutional guidelines on cycle 1 day 15 or later; Gilteritinib clinical and pharmacokinetic 
data from the 02 Feb 2015 cut-off was updated with data from the 31 Oct 2015 cut-off; Instructions to 
investigators  regarding  gilteritinib  dose  reduction  and  interruptions  were  clarified;  Methodology  for 
assessment of exposure and compliance were clarified; Laboratory tests administered were updated with 
the addition of thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone and aPPT. Language to clarify that 2 laboratories 
were assaying bone marrow samples for different parameters was added;  Purposes and conditions of 
the PGx substudy participation were updated to clarify that genes of relevance to AML patients may be

analyzed  in  relationship  to  gilteritinib  treatment,  and  that  consenting  patients  may  (instead  of  will) 
participate. 
Early  after  implementation  of  this  amendment,  a  non-substantial  amendment  was  implemented  (27 
September 2016).  
Substantial Amendment 8 dated 20 September 2017 
A co-primary objective for Interim Analysis 1 and updated response definitions were added. Co-primary 
objective  of  CR/CRh  was  added  including  a  formal  interim  analysis  for  the  co-primary  endpoint;  The 
secondary objectives and endpoints were updated. Two new secondary objectives/endpoints were added 
to the study. These  secondary objectives are  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP2215 therapy 
versus  salvage  chemotherapy  in  terms  of:  (1)  complete  remission  with  partial  hematologic  recovery 
(CRh) rate and (2) transfusion conversion rate; transfusion maintenance rate; Additional language was 
added to describe the collection of concomitant medications; Additional language was added to describe 
the collection of AEs for patients who underwent HSCT; Statistical analyses for key secondary efficacy 
endpoints, secondary endpoints and exploratory endpoints were updated. 
Protocol Deviations 
Overall (for the ITT) as of the final analysis data cut-off date, 11.6 % (43/371) of patients had a protocol 
deviation.

Numbers analysed 
The following study populations were used for analysis of efficacy data: 
The  ITT  population  consisted  of  all  patients  who  were  randomized  (gilteritinib  N  =  247;  salvage 
chemotherapy N = 124). 
The FAS consisted of all randomized patients with an FLT3 mutation detected by the FLT3 CDx and was 
used for sensitivity analyses of efficacy data in interim analysis 2 and the final analysis (gilteritinib N = 
243; salvage chemotherapy N = 123). 
The  RAS  consisted  of  patients  who  were  at  least  112  days  past  the  first  dose  of  gilteritinib  or 
randomization (for patients who did not receive gilteritinib). It was defined only for interim analysis 1, 
where it was used for efficacy analyses (gilteritinib N = 142). 
The PPS included all patients of the ITT who did not meet any of the protocol defined criteria for exclusion. 
The  PPS  was  used  for  sensitivity  analyses  of  efficacy  data  (gilteritinib  arm  N  =  217;  salvage 
chemotherapy arm N = 124). 
The mRAS was defined for Interim Analysis 1 only, where it was used for sensitivity analyses. Included 
all patients of the RAS who did not meet any 1 of the exclusion criteria listed for PPS, with the criteria 
on FLT3 mutation modification to “No central FLT3 mutation at baseline” (gilteritinib arm N = 124). 
The safety analysis set (SAF) consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment 
(ASP2215 or salvage chemotherapy) and was used for all safety variables (gilteritinib N = 246; salvage 
chemotherapy N = 109). 
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS) consisted of the subset of the SAF for which at least 1 plasma 
concentration data is available and for whom the time of dosing on the day of sampling is known.

Leukaemia free survival 
Leukaemia free survival was only applicable to patients with a best response of CRc (gilteritinib 134/247 
vs salvage chemotherapy 27/124). The gilteritinib arm had a median LFS (95%CI) of 4.4 months (3.6, 
5.2).  
• 
Transfusion conversion rate; transfusion maintenance rate 
Among the 197 patients who were dependent on RBC and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 68 became 
independent  of  RBC  and  platelet  transfusions  during  any  56-day  postbaseline  period;  the  transfusion 
conversion rate was 34.5% (95% CI: 27.9, 41.6) ].  For the 49 patients who were independent of both 
RBC  and  platelet  transfusions  at  baseline,  29   remained  transfusion-independent  during  any  56-day 
postbaseline period; the transfusion maintenance rate was 59.2% (95% CI: 44.2, 73.0).

Overall in the ITT population, 114 (46.2%) subjects in the gilteritinib arm and 76 (61.3%) subjects in 
the  salvage  chemotherapy  arm  received  subsequent  AML  therapy  during  the  follow-up  period,  after 
discontinuation of  the  study  drug.  For  143  (75.3%)  of  the  patients  subsequent  AML  therapy  regimes 
were not specified but recorded as «Other».

Exploratory endpoints: Patient reported outcomes (PRO) 
The change from baseline in BFI fatigue score, FACIT-Dys-SF and functional limitations subscales scores, 
FACT-Leu total score and dizziness and mouth sore subscales scores for cycle 2, day 1 were similar in 
the gilteritinib arm compared with the salvage chemotherapy arm. The median EQ-5D-5L VAS change 
from baseline score was 0 for the gilteritinib arm and -3.0 for the salvage chemotherapy arm at cycle 2, 
day 1. The median utility change from baseline score was 0 for the gilteritinib arm and 0.1 for the salvage 
chemotherapy  arm  at  cycle  2,  day  1.  For  each  of  the  5  EQ-5D-5L  dimension  scores,  the  majority  of 
patients in both treatment arms reported no problem (score of 1) at baseline and at cycle 2, day 1.  
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analysis of OS 
Median OS was also longer in the gilteritinib arm compared with the salvage chemotherapy arm for the 
sensitivity analyses  conducted using the FAS (HR=  0.637;  95%  CI:0.488,  0.830,  p=  0.0008) and by 
censoring  patients  at  the  time  of  new  antileukemia  therapy  (HR=  0.447:  95%  CI  0.312,  0.639,  p< 
0.0001). The PPS sensitivity analysis the showed a HR of 0.841 (95% CI: 0.600, 1.180, p=0.1577) with 
a median OS of 10.3 months for gilteritinib and 7.8 months for salvage chemotherapy. 
Resampling and tipping-point analysis for early censored vs non-censored patients 
Based on 10,000 resampled datasets, the mean HR estimate was 0.638 (95% CI: 0.605, 0.679) for 
the analysis covering the first 8 weeks and 0.635 (95% CI: 0.591, 0.687), for the analysis covering the 
first 6 months. The rejection of the null hypothesis was 100% for both scenarios.

previous administrative censorings had been updated, including 19 and 3 additional deaths in the 
gilteritinib and chemotherapy arms respectively. Results of the new OS analysis were consistent with 
the primary analysis (data cut of 17 Sep 2018). Median OS 9.3 and 5.4 months respectively in the 
gilteritinib and chemotherapy arms, HR: 0.683, 1-sided p= 0.0016 (data not shown).

The majority of patients continued gilteritinib post-HSCT (40/63, 63%). A total of 14 patients did not 
fulfil the criteria for re-initiation of gilteritinib (including the 8 patients receiving HSCT off-study) and in 
9 patients the reason for not reintroducing gilteritinib was not known.

FLT3 TKD mutations 
In the gilteritinib arm, median OS was 8.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.5, 11.1) in the 
FLT3-TKD alone subgroup versus 9.5 months (95% CI: 7.7, 10.7) in the FLT3-ITD subgroup.  Survival 
probability at 6 months was 56.4% (95% CI: 32.8, 74.5) in the FLT3-TKD alone subgroup and 66.2% 
(95% CI: 59.5, 72.1) in the FLT3-ITD subgroup. 
FLT3 ITD allelic ratio 
Exploratory analysis based on different FLT-3 ITD allelic ratio cut-off levels have been provided, based 
on 335 patients that tested positive for FLT3 –ITD before inclusion in the study 2215-CL-0301. 
Table 41 Overall Survival by FLT3 Signal Ratio Group–Full Analysis Set (Study 2215-CL-
0301) 
•  Multigene Analysis 
The  screening  samples  from  FLT3  mutation  assessment  or  disease  assessment  were  evaluated  by  a 
multigene AML mutation panel to assess the relationship of efficacy of gilteritinib and mutational status 
of AML-related genes. Four mutational subgroups were identified where a mutation was detected in at 
least 10% of patients in the multigene analysis set (MAS). These were DNMT3A (31.9%, 115/361), NPM1 
(47.9%, 173/361)), WT1 (18%, 65/361)), co-occurring DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations (23.8% 86/361)) 
and  AXL  positive  blasts  (16%).  This  was  as  expected  based  on  the  reported  prevalence  of  these 
mutations in patients with FLT3 mutation positive AML (Garg et al. (13)). 
The median (95% CI) OS for patients with DNMT3A mutation in the gilteritinib arm was 9.1 (6.3, 11.1)   
and 5.5 (3.7, 7.4) in the chemotherapy compared to 9.0 (7.1, 10.7) and 5.6 (4.3, 7.5) respectively, in 
the population without DNMT3A mutation.  
The median (95% CI) OS for patients with  NPM1 mutation in the gilteritinib arm was 8.3 (6.1, 11.0)   
and 5.1 (3.4, 6.1) in the chemotherapy arm compared to 9.6 (7.7, 10.8) and 7.1 (4.7, 10.0) respectively, 
in the population without NPM1 mutation. 
For WT1 mutation positive patients the median OS (95% CI) was 9.1 (6.6, 14.7) in the gilteritinib arm  
and 3.4 (1.9, 5.2) in the chemotherapy compared to 9.0 (7.1, 10.7) and 6.3 (5.2, 7.6) respectively, in 
the population without WT1 mutation. 
The median AXL positive blasts as a percent of the total blast population was 16%. The median OS (95% 
CI) of gilteritinib-treated patients with greater than or equal to the median AXL positive blast percent 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019

(AXL high) was 10.7 (8.7, 12.5) compared to 8.0 (6.1, 10.4) in the gilteritinib- treated with less than 
the median AXL positive blast percent (AXL low). Median OS in AXL high and AXL low chemotherapy-
treated patients was 6.3 (3.5, 8.0) and 6.1 (4.3, 8.9) respectively.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy comes from a single pivotal phase III multicenter randomised, open-label 
study comparing gilteritinib monotherapy (n=247) vs. salvage chemotherapy (n=124) in patients with 
FLT3 positive AML refractory to or relapsed after first-line treatment with or without HSCT consolidation. 
The overall design of the study is considered adequate to demonstrate the clinical benefit of gilteritinib 
120 mg daily over salvage chemotherapy in R/R AML patients with one prior line of AML therapy.

The open label design is considered acceptable, due to the differences in the mode of administrations of 
gilteritinib and the different chemotherapy regimens. 
As per study design, patients in the high intensity chemotherapy group (60%, treated for 1-2 cycles) 
reached the long-term follow-up part (with no protocol required bone marrow or clinical and laboratory 
assessments) several months earlier than patients in the gilteritinib arm, who were treated until lack of 
clinical benefit. These differences both in frequency and type of follow-up lead to a lack of systematic 
documentation of response/relapse status beyond 1-2 months post randomisation in the high intensity 
chemotherapy group.  
The sponsor modified response criteria are  less stringent than the 2003  International Working Group 
(IWG) criteria i.e. the IWG criteria lack the CRp definition and are more stringent in the definition of CRi, 
allowing for either incomplete neutrophil or platelet recovery (not both) with requirement of platelet and 
red blood cell transfusion independence. A responder analysis using the IWG (2003) criteria showed a 
reduction of the CRi rate, and thus a substantial decrease in the CRc rate in both treatment arms (54% 
to 35% for gilteritinib vs 22% to 13% for chemotherapy). Based on these data, it is not clear that the 
modified criteria are better suited to capture the efficacy of gilteritinib. Nevertheless, the SmPC includes 
only the CR and CRh rates, and these have been adequately defined in section 5.1, which is considered 
acceptable. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate to enrol a heterogeneous population with 
R/R FLT3-ITD (+) AML. The inclusion of patients with ECOG PS  ≤ 2, patients not eligible for standard 
first-line therapy, and patients with both short and long duration of CRc following 1st line treatment is 
supported, as it improves the external validity of the results.  
Patients could be defined as refractory after receiving only 1 cycle of induction therapy. This deviates 
from standard of care (ELN guidelines) which recommends 2 cycles. The majority of patients classified 
as primary refractory (90/146) had only received 1 cycle of high intensity chemotherapy; this is reflected 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
As would be expected, the number of patients with FLT3-TKD alone mutations was limited. There is no 
clear indication that the efficacy of gilteritinib in these patients would be substantially reduced since the 
OS  benefit of  gilteritinib  over  chemotherapy  is  comparable  to  that  observed  in  patients  with  FLT  ITD 
mutations, and the non-clinical data indicate that gilteritinib would be effective also in patients with TKD 
mutations. 
There is no standard treatment for R/R AML, and the 4 chemotherapy regimens chosen for the active 
control arm (two high intensity regimens and tow low intensity regimen) are considered appropriate in 
the current R/R setting. Allocation of high vs low intensity chemotherapy was at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Despite  the  lack  of  pre-specified  criteria,  it  is  considered  that  the  pre-randomization 
assignment of patients and the stratification based on high vs low intensity therapy is sufficient to ensure 
trial validity and the balanced distribution of patients across treatments. 
The starting dose of gilteritinib (120 mg) appears reasonably justified, although data are rather limited. 
Dose-escalation to 200 mg was allowed at the discretion of the investigator, in patients not achieving a 
response (CRc) following one treatment cycle. There is an uncertainty with regard to the benefit of the 
proposed dose escalation strategy in non-responding patients, as it cannot be determined whether the 
observed  increased  response  rates  is  due  to  the  increase  in  gilteritinib  dose  or  the  longer  treatment 
duration. Never the less, the dose escalation strategy was a central part of the pivotal study design, (i.e. 
31% (78/247) of the patients in the gilteritinib arm actually received the 200 mg dose/day), and the ITT 
analyses on which the B/R is established includes  78 patients that were dose escalated. Furthermore, 
there are no data that can reliable establish a lack of benefit for the proposed dose escalation strategy. 
Therefore, the option to dose escalate non-responding patients should be included in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 94/126 
 
  
  
Supplemental  data  from  the  pivotal  study  confirms  that  a  substantial  proportion  of  patients  will  only 
respond after several treatment cycles; therefore, continuation of treatment at the prescribed dose for 
up to 6 months should be considered to allow time for a clinical response. (SmPC, section 4.2). 
The co-primary efficacy endpoint of CR/CRh rate was evaluated at the first interim analysis only. For the 
second  interim  analysis  and  in  the  final  analysis,  OS  was  the  primary  endpoint  and  CR  and  EFS  was 
defined  as  key  secondary  endpoints.  For  the  purpose  of  this  assessment,  the  final  OS  analysis  is 
considered  the  primary  efficacy  outcome  measure,  in  line  with  the  CHMP  scientific  advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/3789/1/FU/4/2018/PA/II).  The  statistical  methods  are  considered  acceptable.  The  group 
sequential design with hierarchical testing is adequate to control the Type I error for the OS, EFS and 
CR rate endpoints. Adequate sensitivity and subgroup analyses has been planned and performed. 
There  were  eight  protocol  amendments  defined  as  substantial.  None  of  these  are  expected  to  have 
substantively affected the overall interpretation of the results.  The number of protocol deviations was 
low, and there were no meaningful differences between treatment arms.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patient  and  disease  characteristics,  including  the  stratification  factors,  were  in  general  well  balanced 
between treatment arms.  
The primary endpoint (OS) in the ITT population showed a statistically significant increase in OS, with a 
HR  of  0.637  (95%  CI:  0.490-  to  0.830,  p=0.0004  one-sided  log  rank  test)  and  a  median  OS  of  9.3 
months and 5.6 months in the qilteritinib and salvage chemotherapy arms, respectively.  An increase in 
median OS of 3.7 months is considered clinically relevant in this patient population with a rather poor 
prognosis.  There  was  a  difference  in  distribution  of  censored  subjects  between  treatment  arms,  with 
more early censored observations occurring in the salvage chemotherapy (15/124) arm compared to the 
gilteritinib  arm  (6/247).  Most  of  these  censorings  were  informative.  The  Bootstrap  resampling”  and 
“Tipping point analysis” using multiple imputation (Zhao, et al 2014) analysis confirmed the robustness 
of the OS results.  
The results of the other pre-planned sensitivity analysis (including censoring at HSCT and at time of new 
antileukemia treatment) are generally consistent with the primary analysis. Patient who had received 
prior treatment with gilteritinib or other FLT3 inhibitors (with the exception of sorafenib and midostaurin 
used  in  first-line  therapy  regimen  as  part  of  induction,  consolidation  and/or  maintenance)  were  not 
eligible. The proportion of patients with prior use of FLT3 inhibitors was small (12%). However, also in 
this subpopulation results were in favour of gilteritinib in terms of CR rate (18% vs 0%) and the HR for 
OS  0.705  (95%CI:  0.346,  1.438).  Thus,  exclusion  of  patients  with  prior  FLT3  inhibitors  from  the 
indication was not considered necessary. 
Subgroup analyses showed a beneficial effect of gilteritinib over chemotherapy across several prognostic 
factors such as age, response category to first line therapy, AML risk score, and for patients eligible for 
low and high intensity treatment. In primary refractory patients the observed median OS benefit was 
not supported by the HR. However, this discrepancy could be explained by the crossing of survival curves 
at 15 months, making the HR estimate unreliable. Furthermore, the median OS benefit was supported 
by a consistent increase in response rates for gilteritinib vs chemotherapy, thus supporting a positive 
B/R also in this subpopulation. 
The EFS endpoint did not meet the pre-specified criteria for statistical significance (HR= 0.93 95% CI 
0.577, 1.089, p=0.0830 two-sided log rank test), although a trend towards an increased duration was 
observed (median 2.8 months vs 0.7 months for gilteritinib vs chemotherapy). The early steep drop in 
EFS is due to the definition of treatment failures in the analysis (fails to achieve any of the response of 
CR, CRp or CRi during the treatment) with the event date assigned to randomization date. Treatment

failures assigned to randomisation date constitutes a high proportion (38-39%) of the total EFS events, 
and by month 3 there were only 108 vs 4 patients included in the number at risk for the chemotherapy 
and gilteritinib arms, respectively. The lack of long-term (beyond 2 months) systematic documentation 
of response and relapse status in the high intensity chemotherapy group, and the large proportion of 
patients  with  no  evaluable  post-baseline  response  assessments  in  the  salvage  chemotherapy  arm 
preclude relevant comparisons of response rates and response related time-to event endpoints between 
the treatment arms, and the benefit evaluation relies heavily on the OS data. 
More patients in the gilteritinib arm compared to the salvage chemotherapy arm achieved a response to 
treatment,  including  21.1%  vs  10.5%  obtaining  a  CR.  A  large  proportion  of  patients  in  the  salvage 
chemotherapy group had “No evaluable post-baseline bone marrow assessment” (39.5% vs 5.7% in the 
gilteritinib arm) of which the majority were randomized but not treated and patients treated without post 
baseline assessment. In the ITT population the median (95% CI) duration of CR was 14.8 (11.0, NE) 
months in the gilteritinib arm and 1.8 (NE, NE) in the salvage chemotherapy arm (Log-Rank test P-value 
=  0.1189).  Results  were  similar in the  analysis  of  duration of  CR/CRh  (median  of  11  vs  1.8  months, 
respectively). 
Similar to the EFS analysis, the limited follow-up of responses and high censoring rate in the salvage 
chemotherapy  group  precludes  relevant  comparisons  of  duration  of  response.  In  the  gilteritinib  arm, 
durable complete responses were achieved. 
Transplantation  rate  was  higher  in  the  gilteritinib  arm  compared  to  the  salvage  chemotherapy  arm 
(25.5%  vs  15.3%,  unstratified  p-value  0.033).  Post-transplantation  outcomes  were  generally 
comparable  between  treatment  arms,  with  the  majority  of  patients  being  in  remission  (65%  in  the 
gilteritinib arm vs 68% in the chemotherapy arm).  OS analyses based on the latest data cut off (17 May 
2019) are still immature, but based on the KM curves, OS is comparable up to approximately 20 months 
after which the number of patients at risk is limited.  
Due  to  the  lack  of  re-randomization  following  HSCT,  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  post-HSCT  gilteritinib 
cannot be determined. However, as this was the overall treatment strategy for giteritinib and as there 
are  no  comparative  data  to  substantiate  long-term  benefit  in  patients  not  receiving  post-transplant 
treatment, the option to re-initiate gilteritinib following HSCT in is included in section 4.2 of the PI. The 
pivotal study included R/R AML patients previously treated with only 1 prior line of therapy and could 
therefore  not  support  the  wide  claimed  indication.  Data  from  the  supportive  study  (2215-CL-0101), 
including a total of 108 patients treated with >1 previous therapy, indicate that responses, (CR and CRc) 
are achieved also for patients in later treatment lines, and the reported median OS generally exceeds 
that observed with chemotherapy both in the clinical pivotal study and in a historical dataset provided 
(Roboz  2014).  Furthermore,  there  is  no  clear  indication  from  the  PD  data  on  potential  resistance 
mechanisms, to suggest a reduced benefit of gilteritinib vs chemotherapy in later treatment lines. Also 
the  safety  data  do  not  indicate  any  clinically  meaningful  differences  with  regards  to  number  of  prior 
treatment lines. Thus, although the magnitude of the clinical benefit of gilteritinib over chemotherapy in 
later  treatment  lines  cannot  be  reliably  established  based  on  the  presented  naïve,  indirect  treatment 
comparisons, taking into account the totality of the data, the B/R ratio of gilteritinib is considered positive 
also in patients with > 1 prior treatments. 
The OS and CR rates in the gilteritinib arm dose groups ≥ 80 mg observed in the dose escalation study 
are considered supportive for the results obtained in the gilteritinib arm in the pivotal efficacy study.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study 2215-CL-0301 has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of gilteritinib monotherapy in 
terms of the primary endpoint OS, compared to salvage chemotherapy, in adult patients who have R/R 
AML  with  a  FLT3  mutation.    The  statistically  significant  improvement  of  3.7  months  in  the  primary 
endpoint of OS is considered clinically relevant in the intended target population with a poor prognosis 
and a high unmet medical need.   
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  for  gilteritinib  is  derived  from  studies  in  healthy  volunteers,  hepatic-impaired 
volunteers  and  patients  with  either  NSCLC,  solid  tumours  or  AML.  As  of  the  data  cut-off  date  of  17 
September  2018,  a  total  of  179  healthy  subjects  and  764  patients  have  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
gilteritinib.  
The  safety  of  gilteritinib  has  been  evaluated  in  18  clinical  studies  across  different  posology  and 
indications. The safety data within the R/R AML patient population have been pooled across 3 studies. 
The overall safety evaluation included the following safety populations:  
• 
Integrated R/R AML Safety Population: This population is the primary focus of safety assessments 
and includes all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Studies 2215 CL 0101, 2215 CL-
0102 or 2215 CL-0301 with R/R AML.  The integrated R/R AML safety population included a total of 522 
patients who received at least 1 dose of gilteritinib, comprised of 252 patients from Study 2215-CL-0101 
(completed  study),  24  patients  from  Study  2215-CL-0102  (completed  study)  and  246  patients  from 
Study 2215 CL-0301 (data  cut-off  date: 17 September  2018). Of these  522 patients,  319  received a 
starting dose of gilteritinib 120 mg (including all 246 patients from Study 2215-CL-0301). 
• 
Integrated R/R FLT3+ AML Safety Population: This population includes all FLT3 mutation positive 
(FLT3+) patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Studies 2215 CL-0101, 2215 CL 0102 or 
2215 CL 0301 with R/R AML.  FLT3+ patients are those who were locally assessed as FLT3+ in Studies 
2215 CL-0101 and 2215 CL-0102, and those who were centrally assessed as FLT3+ in Study 2215 CL 
0301. 
• 
Study 2215-CL-0301 Safety Population: This population includes all patients with R/R AML who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug in the pivotal Study 2215 CL-0301.  This population was used for 
subgroup analyses based on the stratification factors unique to this study and for a safety analysis of 
patients who had a dose escalation to gilteritinib 200 mg.

Dose reductions were experienced by 25.7% (82/319) of patients. In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg 
group,  12.9%  (41/319)  of  patients  experienced  TEAEs  leading  to  dose  reduction.  Of  those  patients, 
11.0% (35/319) experienced TEAEs leading to dose reduction that were attributed by the Investigator 
as drug-related.  At least 1 day of dose interruption were experienced by 47.3% (151/319) of patients. 
TEAEs leading to drug interruption were experienced by 45.1% (144/319) of patients and drug-related 
TEAEs leading to dose interruption were experienced by 30.4% (97/319) of patients. 
All patients randomized to the gilteritinib arm began at a starting dose of 120 mg but had the option of 
receiving an escalated dose of 200 mg based on lack of efficacy, as assessed by the Investigator. For 
patients who were administered an escalated dose of gilteritinib 200 mg, the median number of dosing 
days for patients before dose escalation was 42.0 days, ranging from 26 to 531 days. The median number 
of  dosing  days  for  patients  after  dose  escalation  was  48.0  days,  ranging  from  1  to  756  days.  In  the 
integrated gilteritinib 120 mg safety population, dose increase was experienced by 35.4% (113/319) of 
patients.

Adverse events of interest 
• 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
Overall, 0.6% (3/522) of patients in the gilteritinib total group experienced the TEAE of PRES PT. In the 
integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, 0.6% (2/319) of patients experienced the TEAE of PRES PT. These 
TEAEs were serious and grade  ≥ 3; none resulted in death. In Study 2215-CL-0301, 0.4% (1/246) of 
gilteritinib  120  mg-treated  patients  experienced  the  TEAE  of  PRES,  compared  to  no  patients  in  the 
chemotherapy group (0/109).  
In addition, 1 patient enrolled in the compassionate use program for gilteritinib (developed PRES 18 days 
after the last dose of gilteritinib. 
•  Differentiation syndrome 
Of  319  patients  treated  with  Xospata  in  the  clinical  studies,  11  (3%)  experienced  differentiation 
syndrome.  Differentiation  syndrome  occurred  as  early  as  two  days  and  up  to  75  days  after  Xospata 
initiation  and  has  been  observed  with  or  without  concomitant  leukocytosis.  Of  the  11  patients  who 
experienced differentiation syndrome, 9 (82%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of 
Xospata (SmPC, section 4.8). 
•  QT prolongation 
In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, TEAEs within this category of arrhythmia of QT prolongation 
were  experienced  by  totally  15.7%  (50/319)  of  patients,  and  were  deemed  drug-related  in  7.2% 
(23/319)  of  patients  in  this  population.  The  most  frequent  TEAEs  were  ECG  QT  prolonged  (8.8% 
[28/319]; drug-related in 6.3% [20/319]) and syncope (5.0% [16/319]); drug-related in 0.6% [2/319]). 
One patient (0.3% [1/319]) experienced drug-related ventricular fibrillation.  
Serious TEAEs were experienced by 5.3% (17/319) of patients and considered drug-related SAEs in 6 
patients  (1.9%),  these  were  ECG  QT  prolonged  (3  patients),  syncope  (2  patients)  and  ventricular 
fibrillation (1 patient).  
Of the 317 patients treated with gilteritinib at 120 mg with a post baseline QTC value in clinical studies, 
4 patients (1%) experienced a QTcF >500 msec. Additionally, across all doses, 12 patients (2.3%)  with 
relapsed/refractory AML had a maximum post baseline QTcF interval >500 msec (SmPC, section 4.8). 
•  Serious gastrointestinal disorders 
Overall, 11.3% (59/522) of patients in the gilteritinib total group experienced a TEAE of GI disorder. In 
the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, 10.3% (33/319) of patients experienced an event of GI disorder. 
These TEAEs were serious; 2 TEAE of GI disorder (in Study 2215-CL-0301) resulted in death. In Study 
2215-CL-0301, 0.8% (2/246) of gilteritinib 120 mg-treated patients experienced a TEAE of GI disorder 
compared to 0.9% patients in the chemotherapy group (1/109). 
• 
Eye disorders 
Overall, 32.6% (170/522) of patients in the gilteritinib total group experienced a TEAE of eye disorders 
and  0.6%  were  serious  non-fatal  TEAEs  (3/522).  In  the  integrated  gilteritinib  120  mg  group,  39.2% 
(125/319) of patients experienced an event of eye disorders. These TEAEs were not serious; no TEAE of 
eye disorders (in Study 2215-CL-0301) resulted in death. In Study 2215-CL-0301, 39.4% (97/246) of 
gilteritinib 120 mg-treated patients experienced a TEAE of eye disorders compared to 11.0% patients in 
the chemotherapy group (12/109). 
In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, mean (SD) changes in mean visual acuity were 3.402 dB 
(8.486 dB) and 4.790 dB (10.666 dB) for patients’ left and right eyes, respectively, with median (min, 
max) changes of 1.180 dB (-5.62, 60.00) and 1.980 dB (-5.85, 62.52). Two patients in the integrated

gilteritinib  120  mg  group  (both  in  Study  2215-CL-0301)  discontinued  treatment  due  to  a  TEAE  of 
retinopathy; no other TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported in the system organ class (SOC) 
of Eye Disorders.  
Four treatment-emergent SAEs in the SOC of Eye Disorders were reported for 3 patients in the integrated 
gilteritinib 120 mg group. Two of these events were experienced by 1 patient in Study 2215-CL-0301 
who experienced a Grade 2 event of ocular hyperemia and a Grade 2 event of vision blurred; both events 
were considered not related to gilteritinib and were reported on the same day. The other 2 events were 
experienced by 1 patient each, both in Study 2215-CL-0101; 1 patient experienced a Grade 3 event of 
conjunctival edema, considered possibly related to gilteritinib, and 1 patient experienced a worsening of 
baseline papilledema considered not related to gilteritinib. No TEAE of eye disorders (in Study 2215-CL-
0301) resulted in death. 
• 
Pulmonary adverse events 
Overall, 64.4% (336/522) of patients in the gilteritinib total group experienced a pulmonary TEAE. In 
the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, 65.2% (208/319) of patients experienced a pulmonary event; 
15.4  %  (49/319)  of  patients  experienced  a  serious  pulmonary  event;  and  2.5%  (8/319)  patients 
experienced  a  pulmonary  event  that  resulted  in  death.  In  Study  2215-CL-0301,  7  (2.8%)  patients 
experienced  a  pulmonary  event  that  resulted  in  death.  In  Study  2215-CL-0301,  66.3%  (163/246)  of 
gilteritinib 120 mg-treated patients experienced a pulmonary TEAE compared to 34.9% of patients in 
the chemotherapy group (38/109), however when adjusted for exposure of events per patient year, the 
pulmonary AE rate is 4.03% in the gilteritinib 120 mg treated patients compared to 5.88% of patients 
in the chemotherapy group.

Deaths 
In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, 70.8% (226/319) of patients died due to any cause. In the 
integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, 29.8% (95/319) of patients experienced TEAEs leading to death. 
AML was the most common TEAE leading to death (11.9% [38/319]), followed by septic shock (2.2% 
[7/319]), sepsis (1.9% [6/319]), pneumonia (1.6% [5/319]) and cardiac arrest and lung infection (1.3% 
[4/319], each); all other TEAEs leading to death were reported in < 1.0% of patients in the integrated

Gender 
A  numerical higher  incidence  of all drug-related  TEAEs  and  Grade  3 or higher TEAEs  was  reported in 
females. No meaningful differences were observed in frequencies of drug-related TEAEs or Grade 3 or 
higher drug-related TEAEs across subgroups of patients with different baseline BW measurements.  A 
numerical  higher  incidence  of  drug-related  ALT/AST  increased,  febrile  neutropenia,  platelet  count 
decreased and blood creatine phosphokinase (CK) increased in Asians compared to the white subgroup. 
Similar observations were made for Grade 3 or higher TEAEs.  All drug-related and Grade 3 or higher 
drug-related TEAEs were generally similar between subgroups with baseline ECOG status of 0 to 1 vs ≥ 
2.  A  numerical  higher  incidence  of  drug  related  ALT  was  reported  in  Asian  patients  were  reported 
compared to subgroups living in Europe and North America (data not shown).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  specific  safety  issues  related  to  possible  DDI  were  identified  (see  also  discussion  on  clinical 
pharmacology). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  the  integrated  gilteritinib  120  mg  group,  10.0%  (32/319) of  patients  reported  drug-related  TEAEs 
leading to withdrawal of treatment as assessed by the Investigator. The most frequently reported drug-
related TEAEs leading to withdrawal of treatment as assessed by the Investigator were AST increased 
(1.3%  [4/319])  and  ALT  increased  and  pneumonia (0.9%  [3/319],  each);  all  other  TEAEs  leading  to 
withdrawal of treatment were reported in ≤ 2/319 (0.6%) of patients each.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall,  the  analysed  safety  population  is  considered  as  representative  in  terms  of  the  targeted 
population.  
In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, the median average daily dose was 120 mg/day (range 50 
to 290 mg/day), and the median duration of exposure was 111 days (range 4 - 1320 days). The median 
number  of  dosing  days  was  106  days,  ranging  from  4  to  1313  days),  and  the  median  relative  dose 
intensity was 100%, ranging from 39% to 227%. Increase in number and duration of the most frequent 
TEAEs by increasing of exposure time on 120 mg gilteritinib seems not to be related to worsening of the 
grade of TEAEs. The median duration of ≥ Grade 3 diarrhoea, neutropenia, and pyrexia was highest in 
the integrated total gilteritinib group. Although there was an increase in TEAEs after 60 days compared 
to  the  first  60  days,  these  events  were  most  likely  related  to  AML  progression  and  worsening  of  the 
general condition of the patients, rather than gilteritinib treatment. Follow-up period was defined as 30 
days  or  28  days  after  the  last  dose.  The  30-  or  28-day  follow-up  was  applied  as  a  standard  period 
required  for  reporting  of  all  AEs  that  may  occur  after  discontinuation  of  a  study  drug.  Patients  were 
followed-up after discontinuation until death or withdrawal of consent. The follow up was reported every 
3 months. The presented long-term safety data did not reveal any new safety issues. 
In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, 99.4% (317/319) of patients experienced at least 1 TEAE, 
of  which  drug-related  in  83.1%  (265/319)  of  patients.  TEAEs  with  a  maximum  NCI-CTCAE  grade  ≥3 
were experienced by 93.4% (298/319) of patients, and considered drug-related in 60.2% (192/319) of 
the patients.  
The most frequent adverse reactions with gilteritinib were blood CK increased (93.4%), ALT increased 
(82.1%),  AST  increased (80.6%), blood alkaline  phosphatase  increased (68.7%), diarrhoea (35.1%), 
fatigue (30.4%), nausea (29.8%), constipation (28.2%), cough (28.2%), peripheral oedema (24.1%), 
dyspnoea  (24.1%),    dizziness  (20.4%),  hypotension  (17.2%),  pain  in  extremity  (14.7%),  asthenia 
(13.8%), arthralgia (12.5%) and myalgia (12.5%) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The most frequent serious adverse reactions were diarrhoea (4.7%), ALT increased (4.1%), dyspnoea 
(3.4%),  AST  increased  (3.1%)  and  hypotension  (2.8%).  Other  clinically  significant  serious  adverse 
reactions included differentiation syndrome (2.2%), ECG QT prolonged (0.9%) and posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (0.6%) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019

Posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES):  There  have  been  reports  of  PRES  in  patients 
receiving  Xospata  (see  section  4.8).  Of  the  319  patients  treated  with  Xospata  in  the  clinical  studies, 
0.6% experienced PRES. PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present with rapidly 
evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, confusion, visual and neurological disturbances, with or 
without associated hypertension and altered mental status. If PRES is suspected, it should be confirmed 
by  brain  imaging,  preferably  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI).  Symptoms  have  resolved  after 
discontinuation of treatment. Discontinuation of Xospata in patients who develop PRES is recommended 
(SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.8). PRES has been categorized as an identified risk (see RMP). 
Differentiation  syndrome:  Gilteritinib  has  been  associated  with  differentiation  syndrome.  Following 
reassessment as requested, 11 cases was identified (including 1 fatal case). Differentiation syndrome is 
associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life threatening or fatal 
if not treated. Symptoms and clinical findings of differentiation syndrome include fever, dyspnoea, pleural 
effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary oedema, hypotension, rapid weight gain, peripheral oedema, 
rash, and renal dysfunction. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, corticosteroid therapy should be 
initiated along with hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution. If severe signs and/or symptoms 
persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids, Xospata should be interrupted until signs 
and symptoms are no longer severe. Corticosteroids can be tapered after resolution of symptoms and 
should be administered for a minimum of 3 days. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with 
premature discontinuation of corticosteroid treatment (SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). Differentiation 
syndrome has been categorized as an identified risk (see RMP). 
QT prolongation: In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, the majority of patients experienced  an 
increase in QTcF value from baseline; although the mean value of QTc shows little change with use of 
gilteritinib,  more  patients  had  abnormally  high  values  while  taking  gilteritinib  than  at  baseline.  No 
exposure-safety  relationship  (with  respect  to  increased  AST,  ALT,  CK,  and  reduced  ALB)  was 
characterized.  Similar  to  the  exposure-efficacy  analysis,  there  was  also  an  exploratory  analysis  with 
limited ability to identify any relationships other  than  major trends.  There is a tendency  towards  and 
increased  risk  of  increased  absolute  OTcF  value  in  patients  with  a  cardiac  history.  Regarding  co-
medication with QT prolonging agents; in the total gilteritinib group (across all doses), 11 out of 12 cases 
with absolute OTcF values >500 msec were observed in patients receiving one or more QT prolonging 
agents.  Three  patients  interrupted  and  re-initiated  treatment  without  recurrence  of  QT  prolongation. 
There were no reported cases of Torsade de Pointes. An increased risk of QTc prolongation at the 200 
mg dose compared to 120 mg dose cannot be excluded. However, Torsade de Pointes is included as a 
safety concern in the RMP to gain more information about this risk. With the proposed ECG monitoring 
and  dose  adjustment  guidance  stated  in  the  SmPC,  this  risk  is  considered  acceptable.  An  additional 
pharmacovigilance (PhV) activity is also included in the PhV plan to characterise this risk further. 
Additionally,  concomitant  use  of  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (that  could  lead  to  increased  gilteritinib  exposure 
adding to the observed PK variability) as well as drugs with a known potential to prolong QTc is expected 
to be common in the target population. In study 0301 >80% and >90%, respectively, received such 
concomitant treatment. 
Gilteritinib  has  been  associated  with  prolonged  cardiac  ventricular  repolarisation  (QT  Interval)  QT 
prolongation can be observed in the first two months of treatment with gilteritinib. Therefore, ECG should 
be performed prior to initiation of treatment, on day 15 and prior to the start of the next two subsequent 
months of treatment. Caution is warranted in patients with relevant cardiac history. Hypokalaemia or 
hypomagnesaemia may increase the QT prolongation risk. Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia should 
therefore be corrected prior to and during Xospata treatment (SmPC, sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019

Xospata should be interrupted in patients who have a QTcF >500 msec. If Xospata is re-introduced at a 
reduced dose, ECG should be performed on day 8 and 15 and prior to the start of the next two subsequent 
months of treatment (SmPC, sections 4.2, 4.4). 
Serious gastrointestinal disorders: Among gilteritinib-treated patients in clinical trials, the events of GI 
haemorrhage SMQ, GI perforation SMQ and GI obstruction SMQ were generally grade 1 or 2 and non-
serious. Estimated 5.7% (30/522) of patients experienced an AE of grade 3 or higher. In two patients, 
the  events  of  severe  GI  disorders  led  to  death  and  in  one  patient,  the  event  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation. Given the severity of the indication being treated, the occurrence of such events in the 
patient population due to pre-existing conditions and other risk factors, as well as few reports of serious 
events of GI disorders, the impact on the risk-benefit balance is considered low. An association of the 
events of GI disorder with gilteritinib therapy has not been confirmed. The overall benefits outweigh the 
risk in the treatment of AML. Serious GI disorders have been categorized as a potential risk in the RMP 
and will be followed by routine monitoring (see RMP). 
Eye disorders:  Ophthalmologic examinations have been performed in the studies to assess visual acuity. 
Two  patients  in  the  integrated  gilteritinib  120  mg  group  (both  in  Study  2215-CL-0301)  discontinued 
treatment due  to  a  TEAE  of  retinopathy.  Four  SAEs  in  the  SOC  of  Eye  Disorders  were  reported  for 3 
patients in the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group. It is unclear whether eye toxicity appears as a single 
toxicity symptom or always in relation to PRES. From the preclinical documentation, the eye is a target 
organ  of  toxicity.  Ophthalmologic  examinations  have  been  performed  in  the  studies  to  assess  visual 
acuity, and there are few reports on eye toxicities, including treatment-related AEs. Due to these single 
reports, it is at present acceptable not to include these events in the product information (PI). However, 
since eye toxicity is a concern, eye disorders have been categorized a potential risk in the RMP and will 
be followed by routine monitoring (see RMP). 
Pulmonary AEs: In non-clinical studies, lungs were one of the target organs with major findings in rats 
and dogs. In the integrated population 18.5% (59 patients) experienced pneumonia, of which grade≥3 
in 13.5% (43/319), not knowing how many  cases  are  deemed drug-related. In  the SOC  Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders a total of 30 patients (9.4%) experienced SAEs, of which 5 patients 
(1.6%) were drug-related. These five were respiratory failure (3 patients), hypoxia and pleural effusion 
(1  patient  each).  In  3  patients  (0.9%)  experienced  TEAE  of  pneumonia  (all  considered  drug-related) 
leading to discontinuation of treatment. There were 3 fatal cases due to TEAE of pneumonia. Regarding 
the  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  there  is  a  clear  increase  in  frequencies  in  the  patients  who  have 
escalated to 200 mg dose, including serious events. Differences  in SAEs between the patients before 
dose  escalation  (still  on  120  mg)  and  after  dose  escalation  to  200  mg  is  noted,  including  in  the 
SOCRespiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  3.8%  vs.  11.5%  [3  vs  9  patients]).  Pulmonary 
toxicity  may  be  symptomatically  related  to  differentiation  syndrome.  Pulmonary  AEs  have  been  have 
been categorized a potential risk in the RMP (see RMP). 
Pancreatitis:  Within  the  category  of  pancreatitis,  TEAEs  were  reported  for  0.9%  (3/319)  patients,  of 
which  none  were  considered  related  to  gilteritinib. Grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs  and  Serious  TEAEs  were 
reported for 0.3% (1/319) and 0.9% (3/319) respectively, none were considered related.  
Patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis should be evaluated and monitored. 
Xospata should be interrupted and can be resumed at a reduced dose when the signs and symptoms of 
pancreatitis have resolved (SmpC, sections 4.2 and 4.8). Pancreatitis has been categorized a potential 
risk in the RMP (see RMP). 
Hepatotoxicity:  Gilteritinib  is  associated  with  dose-  and  concentration-dependent  increases  in  liver 
function tests, most notably ALT and AST, and elevations in CK. In general, these increases were mostly 
Grade  1  or  2  in  severity,  were  reversible  upon  drug  interruption  and  seldom  resulted  in  patient 
discontinuation  from  treatment.  CK  elevations  were  not  consistently  associated  with  increases  in

aldolase. Overall, liver enzyme elevations were frequently observed in patients the integrated gilteritinib 
120 mg group, and included elevations of >3, >5, >10 and >20 x ULN of ALT and AST, as well elevated 
total bilirubin values > 2 x ULN  alkaline phosphatase values > 1.5 x ULN. 
Renal toxicity: The kidney/urinary bladder are considered target organs of toxicity and clinical relevance 
of the findings in these organs cannot be excluded as per non-clinical assessment. There have been 44 
SAEs of acute kidney injury (8.4%) in the total safety population of gilteritinib. Of these 8 (1.5%) were 
reported as drug-related serious events of acute kidney injury with gilteritinib. While drug-related acute 
kidney injury was comparable between gilteritinib and chemo in study 2215-CL-0301, the chemotherapy 
group included either the nephrotoxic agent cytarabine or azacitidine. The inherent potential of gilteritinib 
of causing acute kidney injury is still present and relevant for the single patient. That implies that since 
there seem to be a similar incidence of AKI in both gilteritinib and chemo, gilteritinib seem to have the 
same degree of nephrotoxicity / nephrotoxic potential as the comparators (cytarabine and azaticidine). 
The applicant committed to conduct a phase I study to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of gilteritinib compared to subjects with normal renal function 
(see RMP). 
Deaths: The percentage of patients in the phase 3 study 2215-CL-0301 with a TEAE leading to death 
that  was  considered  drug-related  was  similar  in  both  treatment  arms  (4.1%  in  the  gilteritinib  arm, 
compared with 4.6% of patients in the salvage chemotherapy arm).  
SAEs: In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, 80.9% (258/319) of patients experienced at least 1 
serious TEAE of which were drug-related in 33.9% (108/319) of patients. The most frequently reported 
SAEs by MedDRA PT were febrile neutropenia (29.8% [95/319]), AML (13.5% [43/319]), pyrexia (13.2% 
[42/319])  and  pneumonia  (12.2%  [39/319]).  The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  SAEs  by 
MedDRA  PT  were  febrile  neutropenia  (7.5%  [24/319]),  ALT  increased  (3.4%  [11/319])  and  AST 
increased (3.1% [10/319]). 
Dose  modification:  In  the  integrated  gilteritinib  120  mg  group,  dose  increases  to  200  mg  were 
experienced by 35.4% (113/319) of patients due to lack of efficacy. Dose decreases were experienced 
by 25.7% (82/319) of patients. In this population 12.9% (41/319) of patients experienced TEAEs leading 
to  dose  reduction,  the  majority  [11.0%  (35/319)]  of  which  were  considered  drug-related  by  the 
investigator.  Overall,  47.3%  (151/319)  of  patients  experienced  at  least  1  day  of  gilteritinib  dose 
interruption. TEAEs leading to drug interruption were experienced by 45.1% (144/319) of patients and 
considered drug-related in 30.4% (97/319) of patients. 
Due  to  the  limited  long-term  safety  data  available,  long-term  safety  data  is  classified  in  the  RMP  as 
missing information (see RMP). 
Although  a  limited  number  of  patients  escalated  to  200  mg,  these  results  suggest  that  the  dose  is 
tolerable.   
Gilteritinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has been reported in 
patients  taking  Xospata  and  should  be  considered  when  assessing  a  patient’s  ability  to  drive  or  use 
machines (SmPC, section 4.7). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
SmPC.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of gilteritinib at the proposed therapeutic dose of 120 mg was manageable in the R/R 
AML  patients.  The  most  commonly  occurring  AEs  were  generally  associated  with  the  known 
pathophysiology of AML, and known toxicity from other TKIs.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date  (IBD). The IBD  is  21 September  2018.  The new  EURD  list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The  applicant  compared  the  structure  of  gilteritinib  with  active  substances  contained  in  authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
2.9.1.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Xospata  (gilteritinib)  is  included  in  the 
additional  monitoring  list  as  it  contains  a  new  active  substance  which,  on  1  January  2011,  was  not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet include a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Xospata is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is no universally accepted standard of care for patients with R/R AML; possible salvage regimens 
are IDAC with or without anthracycline, MEC or FLAG-IDA. Additionally, there are no definitive studies 
that showed superiority of any single regimen and patients should be enrolled in a clinical trial whenever 
possible. 
In  view  of  the  inherent  poor  prognosis  of  R/R  FLT3-mutation  positive  AML  and  as  no  therapies  are 
approved in the EU, there is an unmet medical need. 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 119/126 
 
  
  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  clinical  package  of  gilteritinib  was  primarily  supported  by  data  from  a  phase  3  open-label, 
multicentre, randomized study of gilteritinib versus salvage chemotherapy in patients with R/R AML with 
FLT3 mutation (ADMIRAL Study/2215-CL-0301). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
ADMIRAL study has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of gilteritinib in terms of the primary 
endpoint OS, compared to salvage chemotherapy in patients with R/R AML with FLT3 mutation. Results 
for the primary endpoint (OS) in the ITT population showed a median OS of 9.3 months in the gilteritinib 
arm and 5.6 months for salvage chemotherapy (HR= 0.637; 95% CI: 0.490 to 0.830; p=0.0004 one-
sided  log  rank  test).  Sensitivity  analysis  censoring  at  HSCT  or  time  of  new  antileukaemia  treatment 
showed consistent results with the primary analysis for OS.  
Subgroup analyses were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis across several prognostic factors 
such as age, response category to first line therapy, AML risk score, and for patients eligible for low and 
high intensity treatment. 
There was a numerical increase in EFS in the gilteritinib arm, compared to the salvage chemotherapy 
arm (median 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.4, 3.4) vs 0.7 months (95% CI; 0.2, NE)), but the EFS endpoint 
did  not  meet  the  pre-specified  criteria  for  statistical  significance  (HR=  0.93  95%:  CI  0.577,  1.089, 
p=0,0415 1-sided log rank test). 
Responses were assessed using the sponsor modified 2003 IWG response criteria for AML. The CR rate 
was  higher  in  the  gilteritinib  arm,  21.1%  (95  %  CI:  16.1,  26.7),  compared  with  the  salvage 
chemotherapy arm, 10.5% (95% CI: 5.7, 17.3), with a treatment difference of 10.6% (95% CI: 2,7, 
18). 
Furthermore,  63  patients  (25.5%)  in  the  gilteritinib  arm  and  19  patients  (15.3%)  in  the  salvage 
chemotherapy arm underwent an allogenic HSCT post protocol treatment.In the supportive study, 2215-
CL-0101, the CR rate for FLT3 mutation positive patients receiving 120 mg gilteritinib was 12.5% and 
the median OS for dose groups ≥ 80 mg gilteritinib was 218.0 days. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  key  secondary  endpoints  (CR  and  EFS)  were  of  limited  value.  The  lack  of  long-term  (beyond  2 
months) systematic documentation of response and relapse status in the high intensity chemotherapy 
group, and the large proportion of patients with no evaluable post-baseline response assessments in the 
salvage chemotherapy arm preclude relevant comparisons of response rates and response related time-
to  event  endpoints  between  the  treatment  arms.  However,  despite  the  lack  of  support  from  these 
endpoints, the robust and clinically relevant benefit on OS is considered sufficient to establish the benefit 
of gilteritinib.  
The  benefit-risk  of  increasing  the  gilteritinib  dose  from  120  mg  to  200  mg  in  patients  with  lack  of 
response  following  one  treatment  cycle  is  unclear.  No  exposure  response  relationship  has  been 
characterised to justify the dose escalation and it is not possible to differentiate whether the increase in 
response rates observed following dose-escalation is due to the increased dose or the longer treatment 
duration.  Nevertheless,  the  dose  escalation  was  part  of  the  treatment  strategy  in  the  pivotal  trial. 
Therefore, the option to dose escalate non-responding patients following one treatment cycle is included 
in the SmPC.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group, almost all (99.4%) of patients experienced at least 1 TEAE, 
of  which  drug-related  in  83.1%.  TEAEs  with  grade  ≥3  were  experienced  by  93.4%  of  patients,  and 
considered drug-related in 60.2%. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher drug related TEAEs 
in  the  integrated  gilteritinib  120  mg  group  included  anaemia  (16.9%  [54/319]),  febrile  neutropenia 
(12.2%  [39/319]),  thrombocytopenia  (11.6%  [37/319])  and  platelet  count  decreased  (11.3% 
[36/319]).  
In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group,  the  majority  of  patients experienced an increase in QTcF 
value from baseline; although the mean value of QTc shows little change with use of gilteritinib, more 
patients had abnormally high values while taking gilteritinib than at baseline. The most frequent TEAEs 
were ECG QT prolonged (8.8% [28/319]; drug-related in 6.3% [20/319]) and syncope (5.0% [16/319]); 
drug-related  in  0.6%  [2/319]).  One  patient  (0.3%  [1/319])  experienced  drug-related  ventricular 
fibrillation. Serious TEAEs were experienced by 5.3% (17/319) of patients and considered drug-related 
SAEs in 6 patients (1.9%). 
Differentiation syndrome was reported for 3% (11/319) of patients. Of the 11 patients who experienced 
differentiation syndrome, 9 (82%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of Xospata. No 
SAEs were reported, but 1 patient (0.3% [1/319]) experienced a drug-related Grade 3 or higher event.  
The percentage of patients in the phase 3 study 2215-CL-0301 with a TEAE leading to death that was 
considered drug-related was similar in both treatment arms (4.1% in the gilteritinib arm, compared with 
4.6% of patients in the salvage chemotherapy arm). 
Serious TEAEs were experienced by 80.9% (258/319) of patients, of which were drug-related in 33.9% 
(108/319)  of  patients.  The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  SAEs  by  MedDRA  PT  were  febrile 
neutropenia (7.5% [24/319]), ALT increased (3.4% [11/319]) and AST increased (3.1% [10/319]). 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of gilteritinib were experienced by 21.9% (70/319) of patients, of which 
were considered drug-related in 10.0% (32/319) of patients. The most frequently reported drug-related 
TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment  were  AST  increased  (1.3%)  and  ALT  increased  and 
pneumonia (0.9% each). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Despite the higher frequencies of Grade  ≥  3  TEAEs and  SAEs in  the dose  escalated  gilteritinib  group 
compared  to  the  non-dose  escalated  group,  the  frequency  rates  of  dose  interruption  and  treatment 
discontinuation were similar across the groups. Although a limited number of patients escalated to 200 
mg, these results suggest that the dose escalation is tolerable and no further data is required. 
In the integrated gilteritinib 120 mg group,  the  majority of patients experienced an increase in QTcF 
value from baseline; although the mean value of QTc shows little change with use of gilteritinib, more 
patients had abnormally high values while taking gilteritinib than at baseline. There is uncertainty about 
the  precise  exposure-safety  relationship  (with  respect  to  increased  AST,  ALT,  CK,  and  reduced  ALB) 
although there is a clear increase in frequencies of AEs, including serious events, in the patients who 
have escalated to the 200 mg dose, despite small number of events due to limited number of patients 
that was dose escalated. Thus, an increased risk of QTc prolongation at the 200 mg dose compared to 
120 mg dose cannot be excluded. Therefore, torsade de pointes is included as a safety concern in the 
RMP to gain more information about this risk. Also, ECG monitoring and dose adjustment guidance are 
stated in the SmPC and the risk is considered acceptable.  
In non-clinical studies, lungs were one of the target organs with major findings in rats and dogs. In the 
integrated population 18.5% (59 patients) experienced pneumonia, of which grade≥3 in 13.5% (43/319) 
Assessment report  
EMA/545585/2019 
Page 121/126 
 
  
  
although it is uncertain how many cases are deemed drug-related. Three (3) patients (0.9%) experienced 
TEAE of pneumonia (all considered drug-related) leading to discontinuation of treatment. There were 3 
fatal  cases  due  to  TEAE  of  pneumonia.  Pulmonary  toxicity  may  be  symptomatically  related  to 
differentiation syndrome. Pulmonary AEs have been have been categorized a potential risk in the RMP 
(see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important effect observed is the statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in 
OS. This OS benefit appears robust across several sensitivity analyses with conservative assumptions.  
Gilteritinib at the proposed therapeutic dose of 120 mg was manageable in the population of R/R AML 
patients  studied  considering  the  disease,  and  the  most  commonly  occurring  AEs  were  generally 
associated with the known pathophysiology of AML, and known toxicity from other TKIs.    
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Given the poor prognosis of patients with AML, the treatment effect of gilteritinib is considered clinically 
relevant, and has been robustly demonstrated in the single pivotal study that was submitted. The safety 
profile of gilteritinib at the proposed therapeutic dose of 120 mg was manageable in the R/R AML patients 
and is acceptable in view of the therapeutic context. 
Therefore, the benefit-risk balance for gilteritinib in the proposed indication is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The pivotal study included R/R AML patients previously treated with only 1 prior line of therapy. In order 
to support the broad indication claim, additional analyses of patients receiving >1 prior treatment in the  
supportive,  study  (2215-0101)  were  conducted.  These  indicated  that  responses,  i.e.  CR  and  CRc  are 
achieved also for patients in later treatment lines, and the reported median OS generally exceeds that 
observed  with  chemotherapy  both  in  the  clinical  pivotal  study  and  when  compared  to  a  published 
historical  dataset.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  clear  indication  from  the  PD  data  on  potential  resistance 
mechanisms, to suggest a reduced benefit of gilteritinib vs chemotherapy in later treatment lines. Also 
the  safety  data  did  not  indicate  any  clinically  meaningful  differences  with  regards  to  number of  prior 
treatment lines. Thus, taking into account the totality of the data, the B/R ratio of gilteritinib is considered 
positive also in patients with > 1 prior treatments. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall Benefit-Risk balance of XOSPATA is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Xospata is not similar to Rydapt, Vyxeos, Mylotarg and 
Dacogen within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of XOSPATA is favourable in the following indication: 
Xospata is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the conditions

the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of Xospata in each Member State the MAH must agree about the content and format 
of the physician educational material, including communication media, distribution modalities, and any 
other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority. The patient alert card will be 
integrated in the packaging and the content will be agreed as part of the labelling (Annex III of the 
SmPC). 
The educational material is aimed at haematologists who treat patients with leukemias including AML, 
and patients with AML prescribed Xospata to further inform prescribers and patients regarding the 
important identified risk of differentiation syndrome. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Xospata is marketed, haematologists who are 
expected to prescribe Xospata, and patients who are expected to use Xospata are provided with the 
following educational materials:

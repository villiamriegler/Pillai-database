that cases of severe hypertension have been seen in 
chronic renal failure (CRF) patients treated with 
Aranesp, including cases of hypertensive crisis, 
hypertensive encephalopathy and seizure, following a 
review of post marketing safety data conducted at 
the request of the CHMP following the 10th Periodic 
Safety Update Report (PSUR) 
The Package Leaflet (PL) has been updated

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
assessment of PSUR 10, the MAH has conducted a review 
of post-marketing data and concluded that there have been 
several cases of severe hypertension including hypertensive 
crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures in the 
chronic renal failure (CRF) indication for which a causative 
role for Aranesp could not be ruled out. Therefore, the MAH 
has included a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
specify that cases of severe hypertension, including 
hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, and 
seizures, have been observed in CRF patients treated with 
Aranesp. 
The MAH has also updated section 2. "Before you use 
Aranesp" of the PL to align it with the SmPC, reflecting 
concerns that chronic renal failure patients, treated with 
Aranesp and exhibiting symptoms of high blood pressure 
should contact their doctor.  Minor editorial changes have

While investigations on the cause of PRCA in these cases 
are still ongoing, the CHMP and Pharmacovigilance Working 
Party (PhVWP) considered it important that accurate 
medication histories are maintained for patients treated 
with epoetins, recording the trade name or the scientific 
name with the name of the manufacturer. It is 
recommended that the product information of all ESAs 
includes a request to maintain patient medication records.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
The amendment in section 4.2 (Posology and method of 
administration) is the conversion from r-HuEPO to Aranesp 
in Paediatric Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) Patients. The 
CHMP is the opinion that the addition of information about 
initial dosing for the once every other week schedule for 
paediatric patients is clearer. This is in line with the 
posology guidance for CRF adult patients and may avoid 
dosing errors when converting from r-HuEPO to a once 
every other week schedule. 
Amendment in section 4.4 (Special Warnings and 
Precautions for Use) is to remove redundant reference to 
Epilepsy. In section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) the 
amendment is to replace reference to "Dyspnoea" with 
"Allergic Bronchospasm.The MAH has carried out a safety 
assessment of allergic reactions responsible for dyspnoea in 
patients on darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa therapy in order 
to evaluate allergic reactions other than anaphylactic 
reactions or angioedema that can be responsible for 
dyspnoea and occur in association with darbepoetin alfa 
and epoetin alfa therapy.  Based on these findings, the 
event "allergic bronchospasm" has been added to the list of 
allergic reactions associated with darbepoetin alfa or 
epoetin alfa therapy within the CDS for darbepoetin alfa.

This variation primarily concerns an update of the SPC 
Package Leaflet 
following the completion of a class safety review by the 
PhVWP and the CHMP. The safety review was initiated 
because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess 
mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with 
epoetins. 
As a result, CHMP requested to update section 4.4 of the 
SPC to include an additional ESA class warning in the 
epoetins with cancer indication. The Package Leaflet has 
been updated accordingly

DDPS has been updated in line with the summary of 
pharmacovigilance systems submitted in May 2008. The 
changes are administrative and provide further clarity on 
the pharmacovigilance systems in place.

SmPC and PL 
This variation primarily concerns an update of the SPC 
Package Leaflet 
following the completion of a class safety review by the 
PhVWP and the CHMP. The safety review was initiated 
because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess 
mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with 
epoetins, and that treatment of anaemia with epoetins in 
patients with chronic kidney disease to achieve relatively 
high target haemoglobin concentrations may be associated 
with an increase in the risk of mortality and cardiovascular 
morbidity.  
As a result, the main changes being implemented are: i) in 
section 4.1, to highlight that epoetins should be used only 
if associated with symptoms, ii) in Section 4.2 to establish 
a uniform target haemoglobin range for all epoetins, iii) in 
Section 4.4 to mention the observed negative benefit risk

The package leaflet has also been updated accordingly. 
Additional sections 2, 4.9 and 5.2 have also been amended 
to correct minor inconsistencies. In addition, the MAH has 
taken this opportunity to re-format the approved package 
leaflet and take into account the results of user testing. 
allow treatment to CRF paediatric subjects >/=11 
years of age. As a result, sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.2 of 
the SPC have been updated. New data from efficacy 
and safety based study 20000100 supports removing 
this restriction, and allow treatment of all ages of 
CRF paediatric subjects, in addition to adults.  As a 
result of this, section 4.2 of the SPC has also been 
updated to provide clarity over dosing paediatric 
subjects. The data from pharmacokinetic (PK) study 
20000126 investigated in paediatric subjects with 
nonmyeloid malignancies who were receiving 
chemotherapy supports an additional statement in 
section 5.2 of the SPC.  The limited PK data in 
paediatric subjects receiving chemotherapy is only 
supportive of a statement in section 5.2 of the SPC, 
with regards to the study findings. The package 
leaflet was updated accordingly.

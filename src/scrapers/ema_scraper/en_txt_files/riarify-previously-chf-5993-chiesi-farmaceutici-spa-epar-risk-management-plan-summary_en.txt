Centralised procedure 
1.  pMDI:  
Trimbow (BDP/FF/GB) 100 μg/6 μg/12.5 μg per dose pressurised inhalation 
solution  is  contained  in  a  pMDI  inhaler  which  provides  for  each  single 
inhalation  a  metered  dose  (the  dose  leaving  the  valve)  of  100  μg  of 
beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), 6 μg of formoterol fumarate dihydrate (FF) 
and 10 μg of glycopyrronium [as 12.5 glycopyrronium bromide (GB)].  
BDP  belongs  to  the  gluco/mineralocorticoids,  progestogens  and  derivatives. 
BDP  is  a  pro-drug  with  weak  glucocorticoid  receptor  binding  affinity.  It  is 
extensively  hydrolysed  via  esterase  enzymes  to  the  active  metabolite 
beclometasone-17-monopropionate  (B17MP),  which  has  potent  topical  anti-
inflammatory  activity  which  include  inhibition  of  leukocyte  infiltration, 
interference  with  the  function  of  mediators  of  inflammatory  response, 
suppression of humoral immune responses, and reduction of oedema or scar 
tissue formation [1-3].  
FF is a long-acting selective beta 2-adrenergic agonist (beta2-agonist) with a 
rapid  onset  of  action.    Beta  2-receptors  are  the  predominant  adrenergic 
receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and thus inhaled FF acts locally in the 
lung  as  a  bronchodilator.  The  pharmacologic  effects  of  beta2-adrenoceptor 
agonist drugs, including FF, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of 
intracellular  adenyl  cyclase.  Increased  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate 
(cAMP) levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of 
release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from 
mast cells such as histamine and leukotrienes [1].  
GB  is  a  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist  which  is  often  referred  to  as  an 
anticholinergic. In the airways, GB exhibits pharmacological effects through 
inhibition of M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation [1].

The triple combination of drugs (BDP+FF+GB) induces both bronchodilatory 
and  anti-inflammatory  action  and  it  is  indicated/recommended  for  the 
symptomatic treatment of COPD for symptoms control and the prevention of 
exacerbations. 
In Trimbow, both FF and GB induce bronchodilation, which is central for the 
symptomatic treatment of COPD. Alongside airflow limitation, inflammation 
also plays a role in the pathophysiology of COPD. The effects of corticosteroids 
on  the  inflammatory  pathway  of  COPD  are  subject  of  ongoing  debate. 
However,  when  used  in  combination,  inhaled  corticosteroids  (ICSs)  such  as 
BDP  may  increase  the  number  of  β2-adrenoceptors  while  β2-agonists  may 
induce glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation and therefore provide an 
additive/synergistic effect. 
The  FDC  of  Trimbow    at  100 µg/6 µg/12.5 µg/actuation,  referred  to  in  this 
document as Trimbow pMDI 100/6/12.5, was first authorised by the European 
Commission  in  July 2017  for  treatment  of  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary 
disease  (COPD)  under  the  trade  name  of  Trimbow®  (Trimbow  87/5/9 
micrograms pressurised inhalation, solution). The initial authorised indication 
was: “Maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a 
combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2-agonist (for 
effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1)”. 
In response to post-authorisation clinical evidence, this indication was extended 
via a Type II variation in January 2019 to additionally include use of Trimbow 
pMDI  100/6/12.5  in  patients  with  COPD  not  adequately  controlled  on 
LABA/LAMA  combinations:  “Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with 
moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are 
not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a 
long-acting beta2-agonist or a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and 
a  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist  (for  effects  on  symptoms  control  and 
prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1 of the SmPC)”. The authorised dose 
regimen for Trimbow pMDI 100/6/12.5 in adult patients with COPD is 2 puffs, 
twice daily (bid). 
Trimbow  is  also  approved  for  the  indication  of:  “Maintenance  treatment  of 
asthma, in adults not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of 
a  long-acting  beta2-agonist  and  medium  or  high 
  dose  of  inhaled 
corticosteroid, and who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the 
previous year.” 
For use in asthma, the Trimbow pMDI FDC has been developed at two BDP 
dose strengths: 
•  Trimbow  pMDI  100/6/12.5  with  the  original  BDP  strength 
authorised 
in  COPD  (100 µg/actuation,  400 µg/day;  also 
referred to as ‘medium strength’), object of a Type II variation 
for the new asthma indication; 
•  Trimbow  pMDI  200/6/12.5  with  a  higher  BDP  strength 
(200 µg/actuation,  800 µg/day;  also  referred  to  as  ‘high 
strength’), object of a line extension for a new strength intended 
for use in asthma only. 
The doses of the two other active components, FF (6 µg/actuation, 24 µg/day) 
and  GB  (12.5 µg/actuation,  50 µg/day),  are  identical  between  the  two  drug

products. Both dose strengths have been formulated as hydrofluoroalkane-134a 
(HFA-134a) solutions to be delivered via a pMDI at 2 puffs, bid. 
This  approach  is  in  line  with  Chiesi’s  earlier  development  of  two  FDCs 
consisting of the ICS BDP at either 100 µg or 200 µg and the LABA FF at 6 µg 
per  actuation  Foster®)  in the  same  HFA-134a  pMDI  solution formulation  as 
Trimbow. Foster® pMDI with a BDP dose of 100 µg (Foster® pMDI 100/6) was 
nationally approved in Europe first in asthma in 2006 and then, in 2014 via a 
Type II variation in COPD. Foster® pMDI with a BDP dose of 200 µg (Foster® 
pMDI 200/6) was approved in asthma via a line extension in 2015. 
The approved indication for both dose strengths of Foster® pMDI in asthma is: 
“Regular  treatment  of  asthma  where  use  of  a  combination  product 
(inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist) is appropriate: 
•  Patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids 
and ‘as needed’ inhaled rapid-acting beta2-agonist or; 
•  Patients  already  adequately  controlled  on  both  inhaled 
corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists.” 
    2.  Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI): 
Chiesi has developed an additional dosage form for Trimbow as an inhalation 
powder  containing  100  μg  of  beclometasone  dipropionate  (BDP),  6  μg  of 
formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  (FF)  and  10  μg  of  glycopyrronium  [as  12.5 
glycopyrronium bromide (GB)] respectively, with coarse lactose monohydrate 
as  diluent  and  a  small  quantity  (0.2%)  of  magnesium  stearate  as  lubricant  / 
surface agent. This product is for use with the NEXThaler® device, pocket-size, 
breath-actuated multidose reservoir system. 
The main rationale for the development of a fixed-dose triple combination is a 
simplification  of  the  pharmacotherapy;  the  three  active  components  are 
administered under one dose regimen (bid) in a single inhaler, whereas other 
so-called “free” triple therapy options may currently be achieved with two or 
even  three  different  inhalers  (each  requiring  different  patient  handling  and 
different inhalation manoeuvres) and with a different posology (e.g. once daily 
and  twice  daily).  Such  non-  FDC  triple  options,  and  associated  technical 
differences, require increased instruction time on the part of the healthcare giver 
and  different  techniques  in  patients’  hands,  resulting  in  a  larger  chance  of 
(critical) errors. 
The main rationale for the development of Trimbow DPI is to make this extra-
fine  single-inhaler  triple  therapy  option  (BDP/FF/GB)  available  for  patients 
who prefer the use of a DPI or who are unable to use a conventional pMDI 
correctly. 
The NEXThaler® also has some technical characteristics designed to improve 
patient  compliance  with  treatment  and  to  be  suitable  for  patients  capable  of 
generating  a relatively low  inspiratory  force.  Moreover,  the  potential risk  of 
multiple dosing is minimised by the design characteristics of the device, so that 
any  dose  which  has  not  been  inhaled  remains  stored  in  the  reservoir  after 
closing the cover. Inhalations taken are displayed on the dose counter, reducing 
wastage and providing the patient with a true indication of the number of doses 
which have been inhaled. In addition, the NEXThaler® is a multi-dose, factory-
filled  device  containing  sufficient  drug  to  deliver  120  doses  to  cover  a  full

month of therapy, therefore eliminating the need for the patient to manually-
load the device with individual capsules with each dosing and avoiding the risk 
of failure in piercing the capsule and in releasing the powder uniformly upon 
inhalation associated with such capsule-based systems. Additional advantages 
of  DPIs compared to  other  delivery  mechanisms include  solid state  physical 
and chemical drug formulation stability, ease of use, the ability to achieve deep 
lung deposition and the absence of a need for a spacer device [Muralidharan et 
al., 2015]. Indeed, among patients with COPD, ease of use and dose recording 
were found to be important attributes of inhalers and multi-dose inhalers were 
preferred to single-use devices [Molimard and Colthorpe, 2015]. 
The NEXThaler®  device is currently marketed in Europe for the administration 
of  Chiesi  BDP/FF  DPI  (namely  CHF  1535  DPI  100 μg/6  μg  per inhalation) 
inhalation  powder  (Foster®  NEXThaler®    and  other  associated trade  names), 
containing extra-fine formulation of BDP at 100 μg and FF 6 μg per inhalation. 
CHF 1535 100 μg/6 μg NEXThaler® was approved as a line extension to the 
previously authorised pMDI product in 23 European countries via a first wave 
decentralised  procedure  (completed  in  2012)  and  a  second  wave  mutual 
recognition procedure (MRP) (completed in 2013), for the treatment of asthma. 
A Type II MRP variation in COPD was approved in October 2015. Finally, a 
third registration wave (via a second MRP) was completed in October 2017 in 
four additional countries. 
This application is a line extension of the already approved Trimbow pMDI 
product in COPD and is intended to receive authorisation for Trimbow DPI 
(BDP/FF/GB) at 100/6/12.5 µg per inhalation administered as 2 inhalations 
bid, in the same indication as for the approved product for COPD.

INDICATION: COPD   (pMDI & DPI)                
Trimbow pMDI and DPI are indicated for the maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Incidence:  
COPD is a common, preventable, and treatable disease that is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms 
and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure 
to noxious particles or gases. More than 3 million people died of COPD in 2012 accounting for 6% of all 
deaths globally. COPD is the major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world; many 
people suffer from this disease for years, and die prematurely from it or its complications. Globally, the COPD 
burden is projected to increase in coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and 
aging of the population [4]. 
The most common respiratory symptoms include dyspnoea, cough and/or sputum production. These symptoms 
may  be  under-reported  by  the  patients.  The  main  risk  factor  for  COPD  is  tobacco  smoking  but  other 
environmental exposures such as biomass fuel exposure and air pollution may contribute. Beside exposures, 
host  factors  predispose  individuals  to  develop  COPD.  These  include  genetic  abnormalities,  abnormal  lung 
development and accelerated aging. The chronic airflow limitation that is characteristic of COPD is caused by 
mixture of small airways disease and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), the relative contribution of which 
vary  from  person  to  person[4].  The  inflammatory  response  contributes  to  small  airways  disease  (e.g., 
obliterative  bronchiolitis)  and  emphysema,  which  in  turn  reduce  the  elastic  recoil  of  the  lungs  leading  to 
collapse  and  obstruction  of  the  small  airways  during  exhalation.  Systemic  features  of  COPD  are  very 
common[5] and their evaluation allows a more accurate prediction of mortality risk and comorbidity risk than 
lung function alone [6-8]. 
An exacerbation of COPD is defined as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional 
therapy. Exacerbation of COPD are important events in the management of COPD because they negatively 
impact  health  status,  rates  of  hospitaliszations  and  readmission,  and  disease  progression[4].  COPD 
exacerbations  are  important  because  they  are  associated  with  accelerated  FEV1  decline[9],  significant 
morbidity, healthcare cost and mortality[10]. Precise estimates of incidence of spirometry-defined COPD are 
lacking for most countries in Europe. A population-based study in Norway showed an overall incidence of 1% 
per year in 18–74 year olds during 9 years of follow-up[11]. A Swedish cohort reported a 10-year cumulative 
incidence of COPD of 8.2% (using the British Thoracic Society (BTS) criteria) and 13.5% (using the Global 
Initiative for COPD (GOLD) criteria)[12]. A Dutch study showed that the overall incidence of COPD in persons 
40 years and older was 2.92/1000 person-years (PY) (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 2.78-3.06). The incidence 
of COPD was higher in men than in women (with a relative risk (RR) of 1.5-fold higher in men). The incidence 
increased almost 10-fold from 0.78/1000 PY at age 40-44 to 6.82/1000PY at age 75-79 (Figure 1) [13].

Figure 1. Age- and gender-specific incidence rates of physician-diagnosed COPD (/1000PY). 
Likewise, a recent study from the UK reported that the five-year incidence (2009–2013) was 2.2 per 1,000 PY 
(95% CI, 2.2–2.3); 68.7% were classified in categories GOLD A/B and 31.3% in GOLD C/D[14]. 
Rycroft  et  al.  reported  that  the  incidence  of  COPD  varied  greatly  between  countries,  but  it  is  difficult  to 
compare estimates because they are reported in different units and over different lengths of time. In most of 
the studies, reviewed by Rycroft the incidence of COPD was greater in men than in women. The incidence of 
COPD was also greater in older individuals, particularly in those aged 75 years and older. Six articles reported 
trends  in  incidence  over  time  for  Australia,  Canada,  Sweden,  and  the  US.  Although  COPD  incidence  has 
increased over the last 20 years, within the last 10 years, there has been an overall decrease. Studies in Canada 
and the US reported that trends in incidence over time were similar between men and women; however, in 
Australia, COPD incidence decreased in men between 1998 and 2003 but increased in women. Two articles, 
both produced in Sweden as part of the Obstructive Lung Disease in Northern Sweden (OLIN) study, reported 
incidence rates in smokers. These studies reported a two- to three-times greater incidence in smokers than non-
smokers when measured by spirometry, and assessed by GOLD or BTS criteria. One study also reported that 
COPD incidence in former smokers was more than double that in non-smokers[15]. 
Prevalence: 
Existing COPD prevalence data show remarkable variation due to differences in survey methods, diagnostic 
criteria,  and  analytic  approaches.  According  to  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  estimates,  65  million 
people have moderate to severe COPD[16].  
Estimates of COPD prevalence rates in Europe vary widely, from 0.2% to 18.3%, partly as a result of real 
differences  in  prevalence  among  countries  and  regions,  and  partly  because  of  other  factors.  Some  well-
designed studies have found a measured prevalence of COPD in Europe between 4% and 10% of adults[17]. 
More than 100 studies of COPD prevalence have been published since the 1970s and most estimates from 
large-scale  studies  are  between  5%  and  10%.  These  studies  vary  in  survey  methods,  diagnostic  criteria, 
analytical approaches and age distribution of the populations examined, making comparison between study 
results difficult[18]. A systematic review of the literature in 21 European countries reported that the estimated 
prevalence ranged between 2.1% (Sweden) and 26.1% (Austria), depending on the country, the age group and 
the methods used[19]. A recent study from the UK reported overall prevalence of 33.3 per 1,000 persons (95% 
CI, 33.1–33.6); 66.4% were classified as GOLD A/B and 33.6% as C/D. The standardized prevalence of GOLD 
A/B was 21.9 per 1,000 persons (95% CI, 21.7–22.1) and of C/D was 11.1 (95% CI, 10.9–11.2)[14].

The number of people living with COPD in 5 EU countries has been estimated as follows[20]:  
•  UK:  3  million  (however  it  is  estimated  that  only  900,000  are  correctly  diagnosed  (1.5%  of  the 
population));  
•  France: 3.5 million (6% prevalence of adult population); 
•  Germany: 2.7 million; 
• 
Italy: 2.6 million; 
•  Spain: 1.5 million; 
•  Belgium: 400,000 (prevalence of 5-8% for men, less for women). 
A  meta-analysis  of  studies  of  the  general  population  worldwide  (with  majority  of  studies  from  European 
countries and the US) published between 1990 and 2004 reported that the prevalence of COPD was estimated 
to  be  7.6%  (95%  CI,  6–9.2%)  independent  of  the  defined  diagnostic  criteria;  the  prevalence  of  chronic 
bronchitis alone was estimated to be 6.4% (95% CI, 5.3–7.7%) and the prevalence of emphysema alone was 
estimated to be 1.8%. The pooled prevalence from 26 spirometric estimates was 8.9% and the prevalence of 
physiologically defined COPD in adults aged ≥40 yrs was ~9–10%[17].  
Rycroft  et  al.  conducted  a  systematic  review  of  the  literature  in  epidemiological  studies  from  Australia, 
Canada,  France,  Germany,  Italy, Japan,  The  Netherlands,  Spain,  Sweden, the  UK,  and  the  US.  This  study 
reported that the prevalence of COPD ranged from 0.2% in Japan to 37% in the US[15]. However, according 
the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) the prevalence of COPD varies by state, from <4% in Washington and 
Minnesota to >9% in Alabama and Kentucky[21]. In 2002, it was estimated that 24 million adults Americans 
had COPD[22]. 
Demographics of the population in the authorized (COPD) indication: 
A population-based study in Norway showed that compared with women, men had 3.1 (95% CI, 2.1 to 4.8) 
times higher odds for COPD. Subjects with a smoking history of more than 20 pack years had an odds ratio 
(OR) of 6.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 11.0) for COPD relative to never-smokers, while subjects older than 75 years had 
an OR of 18.0 (95% CI, 9.2 to 35.0) relative to those below 45 years. Subjects with primary education only 
had an OR of 2.8 (95% CI, 1.4 to 5.3) compared with those with university education. Subjects with body mass 
index (BMI), 20 kg/m2 were more likely than subjects with BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2 to have COPD (OR 2.4, 95% 
CI 1.1 to 5.3)[11]. Likewise, the European Respiratory Society reported that the prevalence of COPD is higher 
in men than in women. All studies show a clear increase of prevalence with age. In people aged >70 years, the 
prevalence of COPD is about 20% in men and 15% in women (Table 1)  [18]. COPD patients varied in age 
distribution between studies. In a study conducted in the Netherlands the majority of patients were in the age 
group of 40-59 years old  (64.6%)  [13] while in a study conducted in Italy the majority of patients were ≥65 
years old (70%) [23].

Globally,  the  prevalence  of  COPD  increases  with  smoking  status.  COPD  affects  twice  as  many  males  as 
females, but this difference will diminish, given the fact that more and more females throughout the world 
have taken up smoking in the past few years in developed countries. There are geographical disparities, with 
a higher prevalence of COPD in South-east Asia (12.5%), but it should be noted that there is an absence of 
data  available  concerning  a  large  part  of  the  world  (the  African  continent  and  countries  around  the 
Mediterranean), for the majority of studies are concerned with Europe. In South America, the Projeto Latino-
Americano de Investigação em Obstrução Pulmonar (PLATINO) study enabled the prevalence of COPD in 
those aged over 40 yrs to be estimated at between 7.8% and 20% (Table 2) [24].

A recent meta-analysis, showed that female smokers experience a faster decline in lung function after the age 
of 45 years compared with male smokers[26].  
In  the  largest  randomized  controlled  trial  of  its  kind,  the  TOwards  a  Revolution  in  COPD  Health  study 
(TORCH) study showed that although female COPD patients had lower risk of total mortality, they had more 
symptoms and experienced increased risk of exacerbations[27]. 
Assessment of COPD 
The goals of COPD assessment are to determine the level of airflow limitation, its impact on the patient’s 
health status and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions or death), in order to, 
eventually, guide therapy. 
To achieve these goals, COPD assessment must be considered the following aspects of the disease separately: 
•  The presence and severity of the spirometric abnormality; 
•  Current nature and magnitude of the patient’s symptoms; 
•  History of moderate and severe exacerbations and future risk; 
•  Presence of comorbidities.  
The classification of airflow limitation severity in COPD is shown in Table 3. Specified cut points are used 
for purpose of simplicity. Spirometry should be performed after the administration of an adequate dose of at 
least one short-acting inhaled bronchodilator in order to minimize variability. 
It should be noted that there is only a weak correlation between FEV1, symptoms and impairment of a patient’s 
health status. For this reason, formal symptomatic assessment is required.

Combined COPD assessment: 
An understanding of the impact of COPD on an individual patient combines the symptomatic assessment with 
the patient’s spirometric classification and/or risk of exacerbations, The “ABCD” assessment tool of the 2011 
GOLD update was a major step forward from the simple spirometric grading system of the earlier versions of 
GOLD  because  it  incorporated  patient-reported  outcomes  and  highlighted  the  importance  of  exacerbation

preventation in the management of COPD. However, there were some important limitations. Firstly, the ABCD 
assessment tool performed no better than the spirometric grades for mortality prediction or other important 
health outcomes in COPD. 
More ever group “D” outcomes were modified by two parameter: lung function and/or exacerbation history, 
which caused confusion. To address these and other concerns (while at the same time maintaining consistency 
and  simplicity  for  the  practicing  clinician),  a  refinement  of  the  ABCD  assessment  tool  is  proposed  that 
separates spirometric grades from the “ABCD” groups. For some therapeutic recommendations, ABCD groups 
will  be  derived  exclusively  from  patient  symptoms  and  their  history  of  exacerbation,  Spirometry,  in 
conjunction with patient symptoms and history of moderate and severe exacerbations, remains vital for the 
diagnosis, prognostication and consideration of other important therapeutic approaches. This new approach to 
assessment is illustrated in Figure 2 below.  
In the revised  assessment scheme, patients should undergo spirometry to determine the severity of airflow 
limitation (i.e., spirometric grade). They should also undergo assessment of wither dyspnea using mMRC or 
symptoms  using  CATTM.  Finally,  their  history  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  (including  prior 
hospitalizations) should be recorded. 
The number provides information regarding symptom burden and risk of exacerbation which can be used to 
guide therapy. FEV1 is a very important parameter at the population-level in the prediction of important clinical 
outcomes such as mortality and hospitalizations or prompting consideration for non-pharmacological therapies 
such as lung volume reduction or lung transplantation. However, it is important to note that at the individual 
patient  level,  FEV1  loses  precision  and  thus  cannot  be  used  alone  to  determine  all  therapeutic  options. 
Furthermore,  in  some  circumstances,  such  as  during  hospitalization  or  urgent  presentation  to  the  clinic  or 
emergency room, the ability to assess patients based on symptoms and exacerbation history, independent of 
the spirometric value, allows clinicians to initiate a treatment plan based on the revised ABCD scheme alone. 
This  assessment  approach  acknowledges  the  limitations  of  FEV1  in  making  treatment  decisions  for 
individualized  patient  care  and  highlights  the  importance  of  patient  symptoms  and  exacerbation  risks  in 
guiding therapies in COPD. The separation of airflow limitation from clinical parameters makes it clearer what 
is  being  evaluated  and  ranked.  This  will  facilitate  more  precise  treatment  recommendations  based  on 
parameters that are driving the patients symptoms at any given time [88].

Goals for treatment: 
Once COPD has been diagnosed, effective management should be based on an individualised assessment to 
reduce both current symptoms and risks of exacerbations (Table 4).

The main existing treatment options:  
Smoking cessation is the intervention with the greatest capacity to influence the natural history of COPD.  
The mainstays of treatments for symptomatic relief in stable COPD are bronchodilators and, as the disease 
worsens,  ICSs  and  phosphodiesterase  4-inhibitors  as  anti-inflammatory  agents  are  recommended  in 
combination with long-acting bronchodilators. The main classes of bronchodilators used in COPD are beta2-
agonists and anti-cholinergic agents. Short acting  beta2- agonists (SABAs; e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline and 
fenoterol)  are  used  for  acute  bronchodilation  and  relief  of  symptoms.  LABAs  (e.g.,  salmeterol,  FF  and 
indacaterol) exhibit a prolonged duration of effect of 12 hours or more and are used to achieve more sustained 
symptom control. Anti-cholinergics (e.g., the short-acting ipratropium bromide, and the long-acting GB and 
tiotropium) exert their effect by blocking the effect of acetylcholine on the muscarinic receptors on the airway 
smooth muscles. 
ICS treatment reduces inflammation associated with COPD. When compared to placebo long-term use of ICS 
reduces the mean rate of exacerbations and slows the decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's 
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Response to ICS is not predicted by bronchodilator hyper-responsiveness.  
Combining  bronchodilators  with  different  mechanisms  and  durations  of  action may  increase  the  degree  of 
bronchodilation with a lower risk of side-effects compared to increasing the dose of a single bronchodilator. 
Combinations of SABAs and SAMAs are superior compared to either medication alone in improving FEV1 
and symptoms. Treatment with formoterol and tiotropium in separate inhalers has a bigger impact on FEV1 
than either component alone. There are numerous combinations of a LABA and LAMA in singular inhaler 
available. These combinations improve lung function compared to placebo; this improvement is consistently 
greater than long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy effects although the magnitude of improvement is less 
than  the  fully  additive  effect  predicted  by  the  individual  component  responses.  In  studies  where  patient 
reported outcomes are the primary endpoint or in pooled analysis (PROs), combination bronchodilators have 
a  greater  impact  on  PRO  compared  to  monotherapies.  In  one  clinical  trial,  combination  of  LABA/LAMA 
treatment had the greatest improvement in quality of life compared to placebo or its individual bronchodilator 
components in patients with a greater baseline symptom burden. These clinical trials deal with group mean 
data, but symptom responses to LABA/LAMA combinations are best evaluated on an individual patient basis. 
A lower dose, twice daily regimen for a LABA/LAMA has also been shown to improve symptoms and health 
status in COPD patients. These findings have been shown in people across different ethnic groups (Asian as 
well as European). In patients with moderate to very severe COPD and exacerbations, an ICS combined with

a LABA is more effective than either component alone in improving lung function, health status and reducing 
exacerbations[88].  
A  double  blind,  parallel  group,  RCT  reported  that  treatment  with  single  inhaler  triple  therapy  had  greater 
clinical benefits compared to tiotropium in patients with symptomatic COPD, FEV1 < 50% and a history of 
exacerbations,  and  double  blind  RCTs  have  reported  benefits  of  single-inhaler  therapy  compared  with 
LABA/LAMA combination therapy. The step up in inhaled treatment to LABA plus LAMA plus ICS (triple 
therapy) can occur by various approaches. This may improve lung function, patient reported outcomes and 
prevent exacerbations. Adding a LAMA to existing LABA/ICS improves lung function and patient reported 
outcomes,  in  particular  risk  of  exacerbation.  The  search  for  a  mortality  benefit  with  inhaled  respiratory 
medications  in  patients  with  COPD  has  been  elusive,  Prior  large,  prospective  and  randomized  trials  with 
mortality  as  the  primary  endpoint  failed  to  show  a  statistically  significant  survival  benefit  with 
salmeterol/fluticasone  propionate  or  vilanterol/fluticasone  furoate  compared  to  the  mono-components  and 
placebo.    Recently,  trials  utilizing  triple  combinations  of  LABA/LAMA/ICS  in  comparison  to  LAMA, 
LABA/LAMA or LABA/ICS have been reported reduced mortality with triple therapy. Unlike previous trials, 
the recent studies target patient populations that are enriched for increased respiratory symptoms and a prior 
history of frequent and/or severe exacerbations with the majority receiving background treatment with triple 
or LABA/ICS based therapy before study enrolment. The largest of these trials (n=10,355) compared single 
inhaler triple therapy versus ICS/LABA or LABA/LAMA dual therapy; there was a statistically significant 
42.1% reduction in the risk of on-treatment all-cause mortality and a 28.6% reduction in the risk of all-cause 
mortality  including  off-treatment  data,  comparing  triple  therapy  with  LABA/LAMA.  Independently 
adjudicated finding reported reduced cardiovascular and respiratory deaths, and deaths associated with COPD. 
A post-hoc pooled analysis of triple therapy clinical trials conducted in severe COPD patients with a history 
of exacerbations showed a trend for lower mortality with use of triple inhaled therapy compared to non-ICS 
based treatments, but the difference was not statistically significant[88].   
Additional important non-pharmacologic components of the management of COPD include physical exercise, 
pulmonary rehabilitation and oxygen therapy.  Smoking  cessation has the greatest capacity to influence the 
natural history of COPD. If effective resources and time are dedicated to smoking cessation, long-term quit 
success rates of up to 25% can be achieved. Besides individual approaches to smoking cessation, legislative 
smoking bans are effective in increasing quit rates and reducing harm from second-hand smoke exposure[88]. 
In selected patients with heterogeneous or homogenous emphysema and significant hyperinflation refractory 
to optimized medical care, surgical or bronchoscopic modes of lung volume reduction (e.g., endobronchial 
one-way valves, lung coils or thermal ablation) may be considered, whereas in selected patents with a large 
bulla,  surgical  bullectomy  may  be  considered.  In  appropriately  selected  patients  with  severe  COPD,  lung 
transplantation has been shown to improve health status and functional capacity but not prolong survival [4]. 
Natural  history  of  the  indicated  condition  in  the  <untreated>  population,  including  mortality  and 
morbidity: 
-  Mortality 
More than 3 million people died of COPD worldwide in 2012, which is equal to 6% of all deaths globally 
that year [16].  
COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the world with increasing prevalence and mortality predicted 
in coming decades [28-30]. The projection for 2020 indicates that COPD will be the third leading cause of

death  worldwide  (from  sixth  in  1990)  and  fifth  leading  cause  of  years  lost  through  early  mortality  or 
handicap (disability-adjusted life years) [24]. 
Of the studies that reported mortality rates within patients with COPD, length of follow-up differed, which 
resulted  in  difficulties  comparing  studies.  However,  the  one-year  mortality  rate  of  COPD  (all  severity 
stages) varied from 4.1% in patients aged 45 years and older, to 27.7% in patients aged 65–100 years in 
Canada, and to 5.1% in patients aged 41–83 years in Sweden. The overall mortality rate varied between 
countries,  ranging  from  3–9  deaths  per  100,000  population  in  Japan  to  7–111  deaths  per  100,000 
population  in  the  US.  COPD  mortality  was  greater  within  the  male  population  than  within  the  female 
population and was greatest in elderly adults aged 75 years and older [15]. Based on the European federation 
of allergy and airways diseases patients’ associations (EFA) book the average age standardized mortality 
rate per 100,000 people across the countries surveyed is approximately 17.25, which is consistent with the 
average cited by the European respiratory society white Book of 18; the highest being Belgium at 27.17 
and lowest France at 6.92 (Figure 3). 
Figure 3. COPD Mortality in European Countries. 
-  Morbidity 
The limited data available indicate that morbidity (traditionally measured as physician visits, emergency 
department visits, and hospitalizations) due to COPD increases with age, and may be affected by other 
comorbid chronic conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal impairment, diabetes mellitus) 
that are related to COPD and may have an impact on the patient’s health status, as well as interfere with 
COPD management [4]. 
Important co-morbidities: 
It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of patients with COPD have one or two comorbidities.  
The  main  comorbidities  present  are  cardiovascular  disorders,  thromboembolic  disorders,  musculoskeletal 
disorders, pulmonary infections and bronchiectasis, diabetes, lung cancer, the existence of associated asthma, 
anxiety  and  depression,  obesity,  anaemia  and  cachexia.  Many  of  those  comorbidities  negatively  influence 
survival[89].  In  a  cohort  study  of  veterans  hospitalized  with  a  COPD  exacerbation  at  six  Veterans  Affairs 
hospitals between 2005 and 2011, comorbidity was associated with 30-day readmission and mortality, and 
with delivery of fewer treatments known to be beneficial among patients with COPD exacerbation[90].  
•  Cardiovascular disease is a major comorbidity in COPD and probably both the most frequent and most 
important disease coexisting with COPD.

Data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were used to investigate the association between 
COPD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US population. Sixteen percent of COPD patients had 
coronary heart disease, compared to 6% of non-COPD patients  [31]. Likewise, the prevalence of angina, 
myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure (CHF) were higher in COPD patients (Table 5).

Meta-analysis  showed  that  patients  with  COPD  were  more  likely  to  be  diagnosed  with  cardiovascular 
disease (OR 2.46; 95% CI, 2.02-3.00; p<0.0001) [32]. A non-interventional, cross-sectional study that was 
conducted  in  Italy  showed  that  the  most  prevalent  comorbidity  was  cardiovascular  (40.0%)  [33].  The 
Rotterdam study showed that COPD was associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (age- 
and sex-adjusted hazard ratio, HR 1.34, 95% CI, 1.06-1.70). The risk particularly increased in the period 
2000 days (5.48 yrs) after the diagnosis of COPD (age- and sex-adjusted HR 2.12, 95% CI, 1.60-2.82) and 
increased further to a more than three-fold higher risk in COPD subjects with frequent exacerbations during 
this period [34]. 
The  main  cardiovascular  diseases  include:  hypertension,  atrial  fibrillation,  ischaemic  heart  disease,  and 
heart failure. 
o  Hypertension  –  Schnell  et  al.  reported  that  60.4%  of  the  subjects  with  COPD  studied  in  the 
NHANES cross-sectional study in the US had hypertension [35]. Dal Negro and colleagues reported 
that arterial hypertension was the most frequent comorbidity and was equally distributed in both 
sex  (around  45%  of  the  patients)  in  a  non-interventional,  cross-sectional  study  in  Italy  [33].  De 
Lucas-Ramos et al. reported that 51.8% of COPD patients had arterial hypertension compared to 
36% in the control group in a multicentre, cross-sectional, case–control study in Spain. [36]. 
o  Atrial  fibrillation  –  A  global  meta-analysis  of  Cochrane,  Medline,  and  Embase  databases  for 
studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and April 30, 2015, showed that patients with COPD had 
two to five times higher risk of cardiac dysrhythmia [32]. 
o  Ischemic heart disease – de Lucas-Ramos et al. (Spain) showed that compared with the control 
group, the COPD group showed a significantly higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (12.5% 
versus 4.7%; p<0.0001) [36]. Chen and colleagues reported in a global meta-analysis that there was 
a two to five times higher risk of ischaemic heart disease in COPD patients compared with the 
non-COPD population [32].  
o  Heart  failure  -  In  COPD,  CHF  is  prevalent  in  more  than  20%  of  patients.  The  risk  ratio  of 
developing CHF is 4.5 (95% CI, 4.25 to 4.95) in COPD patients compared to age-matched controls 
without COPD after adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors in European countries [37]. Schnell 
et al. reported that subjects studied in the NHANES cross-sectional study in the US with COPD 
were more likely than subjects without COPD to have coexisting congestive heart failure (12.1% 
vs. 3.9%) [35]. 
•  Thromboembolic disorders - A nation-wide cohort study in Sweden evaluated the association between 
COPD  and  incidence  of  stroke.  Incidence  of  all-cause  stroke  (n  events  =  17,402)  was  significantly 
increased in COPD patients compared to reference individuals (HR 1.24, 95% CI, 1.19-1.28), especially 
during the first 2 years after COPD diagnosis (HR 1.46, 1.37-1.55). Incidences of ischemic stroke (HR 
1.20,  1.15-1.25),  intracerebral  haemorrhage  (HR  1.29,  1.16-1.43)  and  subarachnoid  haemorrhage  (HR

1.46,  1.16-1.85)  were  all  increased  in  COPD  patients  [38].  The  Rotterdam  Study  (in  the  Netherlands) 
followed 13,115 participants without history of stroke for occurrence of stroke. Follow up started in 1990 
to 2008 and ended in 2012. During 126,347 person-years, 1,250 participants suffered a stroke, of which 
701 were ischemic and 107 haemorrhagic. Adjusted for age, age squared, and sex, COPD was significantly 
associated  with  all  stroke  (HR  1.20;  95%  CI,  1.00-1.43),  ischemic  stroke  (HR  1.27;  1.02-1.59),  and 
haemorrhagic stroke (HR 1.70; 1.01-2.84) [39]. Similarly, Finkelstein et al. reported that eight percent of 
COPD patients had stroke, compared to 3.6% of non-COPD patients in the US [31]. A global meta-analysis 
showed that patients with COPD had two to five times higher risk of diseases of the pulmonary circulation 
[32]. A retrospective cohort study in Canada showed that the  OR of pulmonary embolism prevalence in 
COPD patients was 5.46 (95% CI, 4.25-7.02) [40]. 
•  Musculoskeletal disorders - The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the 
US, which included 14,828 subjects aged 45 years or older, noted a 16.9% prevalence of osteoporosis in 
COPD patients compared with 8.5% in subjects without coexisting COPD [35]. Graat-Verboom et al. in a 
systematic review of 13 studies (from Europe and US) involving 775 COPD patients reported an overall 
prevalence of osteoporosis of 35.1% (range 9–69%) and osteopenia of 38.4% (range 27–67%) [41]. Subjects 
with COPD studied in the NHANES cross-sectional study in the US were more likely than subjects without 
COPD to have coexisting arthritis (54.6% vs. 36.9%) [35]. 
•  Pulmonary infections and bronchiectasis - The most distinct symptoms of an exacerbation are increased 
dyspnoea,  sputum  purulence,  and  sputum  volume.  However,  patients  may  also  present  with  other 
symptoms  such  as  worsening  exercise  tolerance,  fluid  retention,  increased  fatigue,  acute  confusion,  or 
general malaise  [42]. The annual rate of COPD exacerbations has been estimated from several different 
studies to be as low as 0.5 to a high of 3.5 exacerbations per patient [43]. Bischoff et al. reported that for the 
period of 1980–2006 in the Netherlands the exacerbation rate decreased from 44.1 to 31.5 per 100 patients, 
and the percentage of patients with COPD who had exacerbations declined from 27.6% to 21.0% [44]. Most 
often exacerbations of COPD are the result of bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial infection is a factor in 
70  to  75  percent  of  exacerbations,  with  up  to  60  percent  caused  by  Streptococcus  pneumoniae, 
Haemophilus influenza or Moraxella catarrhalis. Atypical organisms such as Chlamydia pneumoniae have 
been implicated in about 10 percent of exacerbations. The remaining 25 to 30 percent of cases are usually 
caused by viruses [45]. A global meta-analysis of six observational studies with 881 patients showed that 
the mean prevalence of bronchiectasis in patients with COPD was 54.3%, ranging from 25.6% to 69%. 
Coexistence of bronchiectasis and COPD occurred more often in male patients with longer smoking history 
[46]. 
•  Diabetes - The NHANES (US) showed that 66.4% of the COPD patients had high glucose levels [47]. Dal 
Negro (Italy) and colleagues reported that diabetes was a frequent comorbidity in COPD (around 45% of 
the  patients)  [33].  De  Lucas-Ramos  et  al.  (Spain)  reported  that  39.5%  of  COPD  patients  had  diabetes 
compared to 9.7% in the control group [36]. 
•  Lung cancer - The annual incidence of lung cancer arising from COPD in the US and European countries 
has been reported to be 0.8% to 1.2%  [48-50]. Skillrud et al. (US)  [48] assessed the risk of lung cancer in 
patients  with  COPD  in  a  matched  case–control  study  and  estimated  that  the  cumulative  probability  of 
developing lung cancer within 10 yrs was 8.8% for those with COPD and 2.0% for patients with normal 
pulmonary function (p=0.024). This indicates that ∼1% of patients with COPD develop lung cancer each 
year, while only 0.2% of patients with normal pulmonary function develop lung cancer (five-fold increased 
risk of lung cancer). Recently, de Torres et al. (US and Spain) reported that 215 out of 2,507 COPD patients 
developed  lung  cancer  (incidence  density  of  16.7  cases  per  1,000  PY)  with  a  median  follow-up  of  60 
months [51]. 
•  Asthma - In the NHANES III (US), 1.4% of the adult participants reported both COPD and asthma, 3.5% 
reported COPD only, 3.6% reported asthma only, and 4.3% reported having chronic bronchitis or asthma 
in the past. Lower lung function and a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms were reported in subjects

who stated that they had both asthma and COPD. In the 1996 NHIS, 1.2% of the adult participants reported 
both COPD and asthma, 4.7% reported COPD only, and 3.9% reported asthma only[52]. 
•  Anxiety  and  depression  -  Anxiety  and  depression  often  appear  together  in  patients  with  COPD. 
Prevalence estimates vary widely, due in part to the use of varied measurement tools and to the different 
degrees of illness severity across studies. In stable COPD, the prevalence of clinical depression ranges 
between 10% and 42%, while that of anxiety ranges between 10% and 19%. The risk of depression (OR, 
2.5) is higher in patients with severe COPD compared to control subjects, with the highest rates, up to 
62%,  found  in  oxygen-dependent  patients.  In  patients  who  have  recently  recovered  from  an  acute 
exacerbation of COPD, the prevalence of depression is high, and ranges between 19.4% and 50%, while 
anxiety ranges between 9.3% and 58%. In a systematic review of 64 studies that focused on patients with 
severe disease, the prevalence of depression ranged from 37% to 71%, and that of anxiety from 50% to 
75% [53].  
•  Obesity - One group studied the prevalence of obesity in a large primary care population of patients with 
COPD in the Netherlands. The overall prevalence of obesity in this population was 18%, with the highest 
prevalence in GOLD stages 1 and 2 (16% to 24%) and the lowest in GOLD stage 4 (6%). For comparison, 
the current prevalence of obesity in the general population in the Netherlands is 10% in adult men and 
12% in adult women. A much higher prevalence of obesity was reported by another group in an adult 
multi-ethnic cohort of patients with early-stage COPD in Northern California, US; 54% of the patients 
with COPD had a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater, which is considerably more than the 20% to 24% of obese 
individuals in the same US state reported by the CDC. Thus, available data suggest that obesity is more 
prevalent  in  patients  with  COPD  than  in  the  general  population,  depending  on  the  severity  of  chronic 
airflow limitation [54].  
•  Anaemia - A study from Germany documents found that anaemia, defined according to the WHO criteria, 
is a common condition in COPD patients who have been hospitalized for an exacerbation or worsening of 
their disease. Anaemia was present in as many as 23.1% of all COPD patients in the study[55]. De Lucas-
Ramos et al. (Spain) reported that 13.6% of COPD patients had anaemia compared to 1.4% in the control 
group [36]. 
•  Cachexia  -  Cachexia  is  a major cause  of  weight  loss  and increased mortality that  affects more  than 5 
million people in the US. The approximate number of people affected by COPD, the percentage of COPD 
patients  with  cachexia,  and  the  number  needing  treatment,  respectively,  were  reported  as  follows: 
16,000,000, 20%, 3,200,000. (Note: These numbers are based on generally reported prevalences of disease 
and literature estimations of unintentional weight loss in these conditions) [56].  
•  Gender Effect - A recent meta-analysis showed that female smokers experience a faster decline in lung 
function after the age of 45 years compared with male smokers[26].  
In  the  largest  randomized  controlled  trial  of  its  kind  (TOwards  a  Revolution  in  COPD  Health  study, 
TORCH) study showed that although female COPD patients had lower risk of total mortality, they had 
more symptoms and experienced increased risk of exacerbations [27].

INDICATION: Asthma (pMDI) 
Incidence:  
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterised by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the 
history of respiratory symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough, that vary over 
time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory flow limitation. Airflow limitation may later become 
persistent  [80]. Asthma is the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease, affecting an estimated 358 million

persons worldwide with 0.40 million annual deaths, according to the 2015 Global Burden of Disease study [29]. 
Asthma can affect the daily life of the affected individuals very significantly, but also the life of their families. 
The number of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to asthma amounts to 15.3 million representing 
about 1% of DALYs lost by any disease and similar to diabetes or Alzheimer’s disease [29]. 
Prevalence: 
The international patterns of asthma prevalence are not explained by the current knowledge of the causation 
of asthma. Asthma has become more common in both children and adults around the world in recent decades 
[3]. The increase in the prevalence of asthma has been associated with an increase in atopic sensitisation and is 
paralleled by similar increases in other allergic disorders such as eczema and rhinitis.  
The prevalence of asthma in the different regions of Europe is summarized in Table 6. The United States (US) 
prevalence  of  asthma  in  2005  was  22.2  million  (7.7%  of  the  population).  In  the  US  alone,  there  are 
approximately 15 million outpatient visits, 2 million emergency room visits, and 500,000 hospitalisations each 
year  for  management  of  acute  asthma  [4].  The  incidence  of  asthma  is  highest  in  the  first  years  of  life  but 
approximately one third of children with asthma will be asymptomatic by the age of 15  [5]. Questionnaire-
based incidence studies that have been published in the US, Scandinavia, Spain and Italy, showed incidence 
rates from 1–5 cases per 1,000 person-years [6].

region  has  amongst 
This 
the  highest 
prevalence of asthma in the world. There has 
been  a  marked  increase  in  the  incidence  of 
asthma attacks over the last few decades, such 
that it is now about five times higher than it 
was 25 years ago. About 20,000 first or new 
episodes  of  asthma  present  each  week  to 
general practitioners in the region. 
The prevalence of asthma is generally higher 
in urban areas compared with suburban areas, 
and  lower  in  communities  living  at  high 
altitude. The lowest levels are in individuals 
who have lived on a farm in childhood. 
The  prevalence  of  asthma  symptoms  is 
relatively similar though it is generally higher 
in  Scandinavian  countries,  and  somewhat 
lower in the Baltic region. 
Demographics of the population in the asthma indication: 
A number of studies have shown gender differences in the prevalence of wheeze and asthma. In childhood, 
boys are consistently reported to have more prevalent wheeze and asthma than girls. In adolescence, the pattern 
changes and onset of wheeze is more prevalent in females than males. Asthma, after childhood, is more severe 
in females than in males [7].

Analysis of 18,156 subjects who attended the second stage of European Community Respiratory Health Survey 
(ECRHS) in 16 countries in Europe, North America, and Oceania showed that the crude lifelong incidence of 
asthma  was  2.61/1,000/year  in males  and  2.72/1,000/year in  females; incidence decreased  in males as  age 
increased, whereas it remained stable in females [8].  
A follow-up of the ECRHS in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Estonia in 14,731 subjects aged 30–54 
years showed that the incidence rate of asthma was 2.2 cases per 1,000 person-years. The incidence was higher 
among females (2.9 cases/1,000 person-years) than among males (1.5 cases/1,000 person-years).  
A  Danish  cohort  (1974-1990)  reported  a  higher  onset  of  allergic  asthma  at  a  young  age  than  non-allergic 
asthma (Figure 4) [9]. 
Figure 4–The Distribution of age at onset of asthma in Patients with non-Allergic (N=463) and Allergic Asthma 
(N=612) 
The ECRHS cohort of 9,091 men and women reported that asthma was 20% more frequent in women than in 
men over the age of 35 years (Figure 5). The incidence of non-allergic asthma was higher in women than in 
men throughout all the reproductive years (HR 3.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.21 to 5.58), whereas no 
gender difference was observed for the incidence of allergic asthma [10].

Race and ethnicity also play a role in exacerbation-prone asthma. African American and Hispanic patients with 
asthma are at higher risk than Caucasians to be admitted to the hospital for management of an exacerbation. 
These  associations  are  not  fully  explained  by  differences  in  socio-economic  status,  asthma  severity,  or 
differences in asthma therapy [4; 11].  
Risk factors for the disease: 
Factors that may trigger or worsen asthma symptoms include viral infections, allergens at home or work (e.g., 
house  dust mite,  pollens,  cockroach), tobacco  smoke,  exercise  and  stress.  These  responses  are more likely 
when  asthma  is  uncontrolled.  Some  drugs  can  induce  or  trigger  asthma,  e.g.,  beta-blockers,  and  (in  some 
patients), aspirin or another NSAIDs. Asthma flare-ups (also called exacerbations or attacks) can be fatal. 
Assessment of Asthma severity: 
Currently, asthma severity is assessed retrospectively from the level of treatment required to control symptoms 
and exacerbations. It can be assessed once the patient has been on controlled treatment for several months and, 
if  appropriate,  treatment  step  down  has  been  attempted  to  find  the  patient’s  minimum  effective  level  of 
treatment, Asthma severity is not a static feature and may change over months or years. 
Asthma severity can be assessed when the patient has been on regular controlled treatment for several months: 
•  Mild asthma is asthma that is well controlled with step 1 or step 2 treatment, i.e., with as-needed 
controlled medication alone, or with low-intensity maintenance controller treatment such as low dose 
ICS, leukotriene receptor antagonists or chromones. 
•  Moderate asthma is asthma that is well controlled with Step 3 treatment e.g., low dose ICS-LABA. 
•  Severe asthma is asthma that requires Step 4 or 5 treatment, e.g., high-dose ICS-LABA, to prevent it from 
becoming  “uncontrolled”,  or  asthma  that  remains  “uncontrolled”  despite  this  treatment.  While  many 
patients with uncontrolled asthma may be difficult to treat due to inadequate or inappropriate treatment, or 
persistent  problems  with  adherence  or  comorbidities  such  as  chronic  rhinosinusitis  or  obesity,  the 
European Respiratory Society/American Thoracis Society Task Force on Sever Asthma considered that 
the definition of severe asthma should be reserved for patients with refractory asthma and those I whom 
response to treatment of comorbidities is incomplete.  
The main existing treatment options:  
The  long-term  goals  of  asthma  management  from  a  clinical  perspective  are  to  achieve  good  control  of 
symptoms and maintain normal activity levels and minimise the risk of asthma-related death, exacerbation, 
persistent airflow limitation and side-effects[80]. For many patients in primary care, symptom control is a good 
guide  to  a  reduce  risk  of  exacerbations,  When  inhaled  corticosteroids  were  introduced  into  asthma 
management, large improvement were observed in symptom control and lung function, and exacerbations and 
asthma-related mortality decreased.[80]. GINA treatment recommendation for adults, adolescents and children 
were updated in 2021 after a review of evidence (steps 1-5). Asthma severity can only be assessed after good 
asthma control has been achieved and treatment stepped down to find the patient’s minimum effective dose, 
or if asthma remains uncontrolled despite at least several months of optimized maximal therapy. 
Persistent asthma, requires long-term, daily treatment with “controller” medications, which may be adjusted 
in a stepwise manner to achieve the treatment goals. Daily ICS treatment constitutes the backbone of controller 
medications for GINA steps 2-5, with an ICS/LABA combination being the preferred option for steps 3-5. 
Unfortunately,  for  as  many  as  29%  of  asthmatics  inadequate  asthma  control  persists  even  after  1 year  of 
treatment  with  ICS/LABA[81],  and  asthma  remains  inadequately  controlled  despite  upward  titration  of 
ICS/LABA therapy.

In Europe, five ICS/LABA products are commercially available for asthma maintenance therapy (fluticasone 
propionate/formoterol fumarate, fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate, budesonide/formoterol fumarate 
and  beclometasone  dipropionate/formoterol  fumarate  and  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol),  and  other 
combinations  are  likely  to  be  developed  over  the  next  few  years  (e.g.,  mometasone/formoterol  fumarate, 
mometasone/indacaterol). Data from randomized, controlled, clinical trials do not demonstrate a clear overall 
efficacy  difference  among  ICS/LABA  combinations  approved  for  asthma 
therapy.  Conversely, 
pharmacological data indicate that there may be certain advantages to using one ICS or LABA over another 
because of the specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles associated with particular treatments 
[15].  
Since  the  GINA  guidelines  revision  in  2015  and  following  robust  evidence  from  RCTs,  tiotropium  was 
included  as  add-on  treatment  for  patients  receiving  medium/high-dose  ICS/LABA  for  Steps 4-5[87].  This 
recommendation continues to be featured in the latest GINA Report[80] and has also been made for steps 3-4 
of the 2016 British Thoracic Society (BTS)[81].  
In patients who continue to be uncontrolled despite high-dose ICS/LABA±tiotropium (LAMA), administration 
of injectable biologic therapies (anti-IgE, anti IL4/13, anti IL5 monoclonal antibodies) is recommended based 
on appropriate patient phenotyping (GINA Step 5).  
Natural  history  of  the  indicated  condition  in  the  untreated  population,  including  mortality  and 
morbidity: 
During the natural course of asthma, the majority of patients additionally develop acute episodes of worsening 
of  symptoms  that  differ  from  the  day-to-day  variations.  These  episodes  are  referred  to  as  exacerbations. 
Asthma exacerbations are important because they are associated with significant morbidity, healthcare cost 
and mortality[86]. Severe asthma exacerbations are associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary function, 
and by reducing the risk of severe exacerbations, it is possible that progressive lung function decline may be 
blunted or mitigated[82], [83]. 
It is estimated that asthma accounts for about 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide or 250,000 deaths per year. 
Many of the deaths are preventable, being due to suboptimal long-term medical care and delay in obtaining 
help during the final attack. Several risk factors have been associated with asthma mortality, including frequent 
use  of  rescue  medication,  low  use  of  inhaled  corticosteroids,  and  need  for  treatment  with  systemic 
corticosteroid or theophylline. Furthermore, frequent asthma attacks, hospitalisations for asthma, and reduced 
lung function have been identified as predictors of mortality from asthma.  
The overall asthma related mortality showed a decreasing trend over the period 1980–2009. In Scandinavian 
countries,  asthma  mortality  rates  have  declined  markedly  over  the  last  ten  years,  a  trend  attributed  to 
improvements in asthma management, and similar findings were recently reported in France and Serbia (Pesut 
et al. 2011, Tual et al. 2010). A recent Danish cohort of 1,075 adult patients (1974-1990) showed that all-cause 
mortality was increased significantly among patients with asthma compared with control subjects (261 cases 
vs 124 control subjects; relative risk (RR), 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4-3.0; P<0.001). The mean age at death was 67.4 
(standard deviation  (SD), 14.4)  years  and  74.3  (SD, 13.8)  years  among case subjects  and  control  subjects, 
respectively (P<0.001). The excess mortality was primarily due to death from obstructive lung disease (95 
deaths)[9]. 
Important co-morbidities: 
No specific co-morbidities for asthma are recognised, except something of not confirmed value. However, it 
is noted atopic individuals, possibly with various hypersensitivity problems, may also have asthma and in this 
context allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. 
In  the  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey  (NHANES  III),  1.4%  of  the  adult  participants 
reported both COPD and asthma, 3.5% reported COPD only, 3.6% reported asthma only, and 4.3% reported 
having chronic bronchitis or asthma in the past. Lower lung function and a higher prevalence of respiratory 
symptoms were reported in subjects who stated that they had both asthma and COPD. In the 1996 National

Health  Interview  Survey  (NHIS),  1.2%  of  the  adult  participants  reported  both  COPD  and  asthma,  4.7% 
reported COPD only, and 3.9% reported asthma only[26, 27, 28, 29]. 
Part II: Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
Relevance to human usage 
In repeat dose inhalation studies, at doses well in 
excess of those intended for human use, the effect 
of  excessive  corticosteroid  use  was 
seen 
(especially in the rat). In clinical use, such effects 
are  known  to  occur  with  prolonged  systemic 
corticosteroid  use  but  are  less  likely  with  the 
inhaled  method  of  administration  due  to  reduced 
systemic exposure.   
The cardiac effects driven by high acute doses of 
FF and GB are also likely to occur in human but to 
a lesser magnitude than in dogs. For the purpose of 
the RMP, patients with previous cardiac problems 
affecting  blood  pressure  or  heart  rate  should  be 
monitored for compatibility with the posology. 
Key Safety findings (from non- clinical studies) 
Toxicity: 
Acute and repeat-dose toxicity studies: 
pMDI: 
The  combination  administered  as  a  single  dose  by  oral  or 
intraperitoneal route in rats showed maximum tolerated doses of 
500 and 100 mg/kg respectively.   
The results of repeated dose inhalation studies in rats and dogs 
up to 13 weeks, carried out with the Trimbow HFA formulation 
containing  100/6/12.5  μg/actuation  in  pMDI’s  intended  for 
human  treatment.  The  main  alterations  were  related  to  the 
pharmacological  class-driven 
immuno-suppressive  activity 
(including  reduction  in  lymphocytes,  eosinophils,  metabolic 
changes, thymus and adrenal  atrophy  or lymphoid depletion in 
the lymphoid organs,  glycogen deposition in the liver)  of BDP 
observed in both species and cardiac effects of FF and GB (seen 
mainly in dogs). In addition, decreased platelets were observed 
in  males  and  decreased  partial  thromboplastin  time  (PTT)  in 
females  given  Trimbow  and Foster®  in  the  13-week  inhalation 
study in rats. The exposures to  BDP+FF+GB at the no observed 
adverse  effect  levels  (NOAEL)  or  LOAELs  proposed  by  the 
Reviewer  of  the  Trimbow  (Trimbow)  pMDI  for  COPD 
application, were similar or higher than the human exposure after 
inhalation of a maximum daily dose of  800+24+50 μg/day (for 
patients  using 
formulation), 
the  200/6/12.5  μg/actuation 
respectively,  thus  confirming  adequate  safety  margins  for  all 
active  compounds,  except  B17MP  or  FF  in  the  dog.  However, 
BDP and FF have been given  to asthmatic patients at the same 
maximum doses for many years (see Foster High Strength pMDI) 
and an extensive clinical safety database is available. The toxicity 
profile  of  the  combination  reflected  that  of  single  components 
without increase in toxicity, exacerbation or unexpected findings. 
DPI: 
The development of the formulation of Trimbow DPI was based 
on the development of the approved Trimbow® pMDI fixed dose 
combination  in  COPD  at  the  same  100:6:12.5  ratio  (w:w:w) 
respectively  for  BDP:FF:GB  and  using  the  same  Chiesi  DPI 
technology platform as the approved Foster® DPI (100 µg BDP 
+ 6 µg FF).  As a result, many toxicological studies conducted on 
the  single  agents  or  combination  submitted  as  part  of  the 
Trimbow®  pMDI  dossier  or  Foster®  DPI  dossier  apply  also  to 
Trimbow DPI. Only results of the repeat-dose inhalation studies 
(4  and  13-weeks)  performed  with  the  DPI  formulation  are 
included for Trimbow and GB.

Key Safety findings (from non- clinical studies) 
Toxicity: 
Single dose toxicity: 
Not applicable 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies: 
The  studies  conducted  allowed  an  adequate  evaluation  of  the 
toxicity  of  Trimbow  DPI  and  an  adequate  toxicological 
comparison  of  the  combination  to  the  individual  components 
CHF 1535 and GB.  These studies did not show effects different 
from that known for the individual components. 
The results of repeated dose inhalation studies in rats and dogs 
up  to  13  weeks,  carried  out  with  the  same  Trimbow  DPI 
formulation  intended  for  human  treatment,  evidenced  adequate 
safety margins.  The main alterations were related to the immuno-
suppressive  activity  of  BDP  observed  in  both  species  and  the 
cardiac  effects  of  FF  and  GB  seen  mainly  in  dogs.    The  no 
adverse effect levels of BDP + Formoterol + GB were multiple 
times  higher  than  the  human  exposure  after  inhalation  of  a 
maximum daily dose of 400 + 24 + 50 μg/day respectively, thus 
confirming adequate safety margins and exposure for all active 
compounds and/or their metabolites.  The toxicity profile of the 
combination reflected that of single components without increase 
in toxicity, exacerbation or unexpected findings.  For this reason, 
no longer chronic studies were conducted. 
No  signs  of  lung  irritation  were  seen  up  to  the  highest  dose 
administered to rats and dogs for 13 consecutive weeks, and no 
local  irritancy  or  systemic  toxicity  were  seen  following 
administration of the vehicle alone (lactose and Mg-Stearate) in 
rats.  
In  conclusion,  Trimbow  DPI  formulation  contains  active 
ingredients  and  excipients  which  are  well  tolerated  at  doses 
higher than the highest therapeutic dose in man.  No interaction 
with increase in toxicity of single components and no unexpected 
findings  were  seen,  only  effects  attributed  to  exaggerated 
pharmacology.    No  signs  of  lung  irritation  were  seen  with 
Trimbow  DPI  and  no  systemic  toxicity  was  found  with  the 
vehicle alone.

pre and post implantation loss, decreased number of implantation 
and number of embryos were recorded at 20 mg/kg/day. Some of 
these  effects  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development 
extended to 2 mg/kg/day but not to 0.2 mg/kg/day.  
Tocolytic  effects  and  foetal  toxicity  have  been 
observed  in  non-clinical  studies  with  Foster® 
and/or  Trimbow  reflecting  the  known  effects  of 
systemic BDP and FF. Potential effects of GB on

Key Safety findings (from non- clinical studies) 
Toxicity: 
In  an  oral  embryo-foetal  development  study  with  Trimbow  in 
rats,  treatment-related  findings  were  recorded  in  the  foetus 
including significantly lower foetal weights at 2 or 20 mg/kg/day 
together  with  a  slight  disturbance  in  development  at  20 
mg/kg/day,  characterised  by  a  slight  delay  in  ossification,  an 
increased  incidence  of  visceral  variations  such  as  left-sided 
umbilical artery, dilated ureter/renal pelvis or distended urinary 
bladder  and  thymus  long  cranial.  A  dose  of  0.2  mg/kg/day 
produced no effect in this study. 
At  0.2  mg/kg/day  however,  in  the  oral  pre-and  postnatal 
development  study  with  Trimbow 
lower  food 
consumption and bodyweight were found from Day 4 of lactation 
until necropsy in the F0 dams alongside a significant increase in 
post-implantation loss, and number of dead pups at the first litter 
check, as a consequence, the litter size was significantly reduced, 
but  so  was  the  F1  pup  bodyweight  during  lactation.    A  higher 
dose  of  2  mg/kg/day  was  not  tolerated  by  the  dams  with 
mortalities which likely reflected tocolytic effect of FF possibly 
compounded by pharmacological effects of GB on body weight 
and  milk  production.  A  dose  of  0.02  mg/kg/day  was  clear  of 
effects on breeding loss and weaning index of the F0 generation 
or on the bodyweight of the F1 generation. 
rats, 
in 
GB 
In an oral embryo-foetal development study with GB in rats there 
was a statistically significant reduction in food consumption and 
body  weight  in  dams  given  25  and  125  mg/kg/day.    The  No 
Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity 
was considered to be 5 mg/kg/day.  No effects on foetal numbers 
or  foetal  weights,  embryo-foetal  development  and  stage  of 
development  were  observed  at  any  dose  level.    Based  on  the 
results, GB did not reveal teratogenic potential up to 125 mg/kg 
and the NOAEL for embryo-foetal toxicity was considered to be 
125 mg/kg/day.   
In an oral embryo-foetal development study with GB in rabbits, 
GB was administered to Himalayan rabbits once daily from Day 
6  to  Day  18  post-coitum  at  dose  levels  of  15,  30  and  60 
mg/kg/day. Food consumption and body weight reductions were 
dose related.  Five females given 60 mg/kg/day aborted between 
Day  23  and  28  post-coitum  and  two  from  the  group  given  30 
mg/kg/day  on  Day 28 post  coitum,  but  reproduction data  were 
not affected in the remaining females, other than a reduction in 
placental  weight  at  the  high  dose.    The  NOAEL  for  maternal 
toxicity was considered to be 15 mg/kg/day but for embryo-foetal 
toxicity was considered to be 60 mg/kg/day. 
Genotoxicity 
No  mutagenicity  potential  was  evidenced  with  the  individual 
active components; therefore, Trimbow does not carry a potential 
risk of genotoxicity. 
Oncogenicity 
No  specific  studies  with  the  combination  Trimbow  have  been 
carried out but since published oncogenicity data on FF and BDP 
components as well as actual oncogenicity studies on GB showed 
no carcinogenic potential, it is considered that Trimbow carries 
no oncogenic risk. 
No safety concern relevant to human use.

Relevance to human usage 
Although the extent of systemic exposure is likely 
to be low, the possibility of reactions affecting the 
cardiovascular  system  resulting  from  excess  beta 
2-adrenoceptor  stimulation  or  M3-muscarinic 
inhibition is recognised. Note that no exacerbation 
of the cardiac effects was observed in dogs during 
repeat dose toxicity studies when FF and GB were 
given  in  combination  when  compared  with  the 
effects  induced  by  the  respective  single  agents. 
Based  on  the  fact  that  a  category  1  PASS  was

Key Safety findings (from non- clinical studies) 
Toxicity: 
Safety pharmacology: 
Trimbow 
Safety  cardiovascular  pharmacology  studies  carried  out  in 
rodents  with  Trimbow  combination  evidenced  no  effects  on 
cardiovascular and respiratory parameters in rats up to 20 mg/kg 
given intraduodenally. No significant effects were  observed on 
Human  Ether-a-Go-go  Related  Gene-1  (hERG)  tail  current 
amplitude (acute application) or on cardiac sodium (hNav1.5) or 
calcium  (hCav1.2)  channels  and  no  prolongation  of  action 
potential  was  noted  in  guinea  pig’s  myocytes,  at  very  high 
concentrations. Chronic application of Trimbow on hERG started 
to  induce  an  inhibition  of  the  current  from  levels  marginally 
higher than the Cmax measured at the corresponding NOAELs in 
repeated toxicology studies in rats and dogs. During a telemetry 
study in conscious dogs treated by inhalation, effects consistent 
with the pharmacological activity of the single components were 
seen. Heart rate increase and blood pressure decrease were seen 
at all doses leading to dose-dependent reduction in QT interval. 
Furthermore,  at  mid  and  high  dose,  the  P-wave  amplitude was 
increased, and the duration decreased; the PQ and QRS intervals 
were shortened. Additionally, changes in the ECG morphology 
were seen, and included a dose dependent increase of sinus and 
ventricular  tachycardia,  ventricular  premature  contractions  and 
1st to 2nd degree atrio-ventricular block at the mid and high dose 
levels. Respiratory rate was increased at high dose, tidal volume 
and minute volume were also increased at all doses.  
In  a 13-week  study  the  high dose  group  treated  with  Trimbow 
showed  a  slight  increase  of  urine  volume  respect  to  the  group 
treated  with  single  agent  GB  and  Foster®  but  there  was  no 
evidence of urinary retention. 
GB 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  carried  out  in  rodents  evidenced 
slight decreases in gastric volume and electrolyte content (H+, K+ 
and Cl-) at all intraduodenal doses tested between 1 mg/kg and 
320  mg/kg,  a  reduction  of  charcoal  propulsion  in  the  GI  tract 
from  20  mg/kg  orally,  a  decrease  in  urinary  volume  from  20 
mg/kg and an increase in electrolyte (Na+, K+ and Cl-) and protein 
excretion  at  high  oral  doses  of  320  mg/kg.  A  decrease  of 
spontaneous locomotor activity was seen at 20 mg/kg and above 
in mice but no other effects on the CNS were observed in other 
standard  studies.  No  effects  on  cardiovascular  and  respiratory 
parameters  were  observed  in  rats  up  to  150  mg/kg  given 
intraduodenally. No effects were observed on hERG tail current 
amplitude  (IC50  158  g/mL),  a  concentration  many  times  the 
Cmax in rats and dogs at the NOAELs after 2 weeks by inhalation 
and  no  prolongation  of  action  potential  was  noted  up  to  100 
ng/mL  in  an  in  vitro  study  on  guinea  pig’s  myocytes.  During 
telemetry in conscious dogs, after inhalation of GB at a dose of 
549 µg/kg (corresponding to a human equivalent dose of ~18,300 
µg/day,  calculated  on  body  surface  basis)  an  increase  in  heart 
rate, slight decrease in systolic blood pressure, slight increase in 
diastolic blood pressure, slight shortening of PQ, QRST, QT and 
lengthening  of  QTc  intervals,  and  1st  or  2nd  degree  atrio-
ventricular blocks (PR prolongation) in 2 dogs were observed. In 
the same telemetry study, no changes of clinical relevance were 
seen at an inhaled dose of 82 µg/kg (corresponding to a human 
equivalent dose of ~2,700 µg/day).

Toxicity: 
Mechanisms for drug interactions: 
BDP and FF are very well-known compounds as they have been 
widely used in clinics for many years, therefore limited in vitro 
investigations were carried out.  
The  ability  of  GB  to  inhibit  the  transporters  Organic  Cation 
Transporter  1 
(OCT1),  OCT2,  OCT3,  Organic  Cation 
Transporters Novel 1 (OCTN1), OCTN2, Multidrug and Toxin

(OAT1),  OAT3,  Organic  Anion-Transporting  Polypeptide  1B 
(OATP1B1),  OATP1B3,  Multidrug  Resistance  Protein  1 
(MDR1)  and  Breast  Cancer  Resistance  Protein  (BCRP)  was 
investigated  in  vitro.  The  obtained  IC50  values  were  always 
higher  than  50  times  the  GB  Cmax  obtained  in  clinical  studies, 
ruling  out  drug-drug  interaction  due  to  GB  inhibition  of  other 
drugs transport.

SIV.3  Limitations  in  respect  to  populations  typically  under-represented  in  clinical  trial 
development programme 
•  Children 
The  inclusion  criteria  in  the  clinical  development  programme  required  that  enrolled  subjects  were  a 
minimum of 18 years of age. Thus, Trimbow has not been studied in children.  
COPD does not occur in the paediatric population. Accordingly,  on 11 December 2015, the Applicant 
received  confirmation  from  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  that  the  proposed  indication 
“maintenance treatment of adult patients with COPD with symptoms, airflow limitation and history of 
exacerbations, where triple therapy (ICS+LABA+LAMA) is appropriate” (or equivalent wording for the 
same COPD condition) is covered by the class waiver condition “treatment of COPD (excluding chronic 
lung disease associated with long-term airflow limitation, such as asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 
primary cilia dyskinesia, obstructive lung disease related to graft-versus-host disease after (bone marrow) 
transplantation)” with respect to a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) (EMA/835279/2015). 
•  Elderly 
In  the  phase  III  COPD  studies  of  Triple  5  and  Triple  6,  there  were  780  subjects  (44.2%)  exposed  to 
Trimbow that were ≥65 years of age. 601 subjects (34%) were 65-74 years of age, 176 subjects (9.9%) 
were 75-84 years of age, and 3 subjects (0.17%) were ≥85 years of age. The percentage of elderly patients 
i.e. ≥65 years of age (44.2%) in the study population is consistent with the percentage of elderly reported 
in epidemiological studies (47.8%) in the US[57]. In Europe the percentage of elderly patients with COPD 
varied between  35.4%[13] to 70%[23].  Thus, the  elderly patients  were  well-represented in the  phase III 
pivotal studies population and this representation is consistent with the known disease epidemiology. In 
the phase IIIb COPD studies (T7 and T8), there were  320 subjects (55.4% exposed to CHF 5993 that were 
< 65 years of age, 210 subjects (36.3%) were  65-74 years of age, 48 (8.3%) ≥75 years of age in T7, and 
389 (50.9%)  < 65 years of age, 294 subjects (38.5%) were  65-74 years of age, 81 (10.6%) ≥75 years of 
age in T8 study respectively. In the phase III asthma studies TRIMARAN and TRIGGER, there were 197 
patients (17.2%) who were 65-74 years of age and 7- patients (0.6%) who were 75-84 years old that were 
exposed  to  Trimbow  medium  strength  or  high  strength  for  52  weeks.  Patients ≥85  years  old  were  not 
included. In the Phase IIb COPD study TRI-D, there were 157 (42.9%) patients who were 65-74  years of 
age and 27 (7.3%) patients who were 75-84 years old that were exposed to CHF 5993 for 4 weeks. 
A safety analysis by age was performed by pooling the data from the Trimbow pMDI arm in study Triple 
5 with those from the same treatment group in study Triple 6. No clear signal of an increased risk with 
increasing age was found for any of the TEAEs, except for a slightly higher incidence of nervous system 
disorders in older patients. However, it should be noted that the majority of events classified under this 
system organ class (SOC) is represented by headaches. When excluding headaches from the analysis, no 
clear trend in the incidence of nervous system disorders by age is found (age <65 years: 1.7%, 65-74: 
4.2%, 75-84: 2.8%, 85+: no events). 
•  Pregnant or breast-feeding women 
There were no issues with pregnancies reported in the studies. 
•  Patients with renal impairment  
A specific study in subjects with renal impairment has been performed. Study CCD-05993AA1-10 had an 
open-label,  non-randomised,  parallel-group  design,  where  one  single  dose  (4  inhalations)  of  Trimbow 
pMDI  was  administered  to  evaluate  PK,  safety and  tolerability  of  the  drug  in  subjects  with mild  (50≤ 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<80mL/min/1.73m2), moderate (30≤eGFR<50mL/min/1.73m2) 
and  severe  (eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2)  renal  impairment  (RI)  in  comparison  to  healthy  subjects 
(eGFR≥80mL/min/1.73m2).

Nine mild, seven moderate and nine severe renally impaired subjects were studied and compared with 17 
healthy subjects. The degree of renal impairment had an impact on GB systemic exposure which tended 
to increase with decreasing renal function. This effect was mainly observed in subjects with severe renal 
impairment. An effect of renal impairment on total systemic clearance was observed only in severe renal 
impairment subjects, while renal clearance was decreased in each group of subjects with renal impairment 
as compared to healthy subjects, showing a strong correlation between renal clearance and the degree of 
renal  impairment.  Taken  together  these  results  suggest  that  non-renal  clearance  plays  a  role  in  GB 
elimination and is able to counterbalance the reduced renal elimination of GB in patients with mild and 
moderate renal impairment. 
The degree of renal impairment had no impact on FF systemic exposure  with the area under the curve 
(AUC)  similar  or  even  lower  in  each  group  of  subjects  with  different  degree  of  renal  impairment  as 
compared  to  healthy  subjects,  while  Cmax  was  reduced  by  approximately  50%  in  all  groups  of  renal 
impaired  subjects  as  compared  to  healthy  subjects.  The  total  systemic  clearance  of  FF  was  slightly 
increased in subjects with mild renal impairment and was similar in subjects with moderate and severe 
renal  impairment,  as  compared  to  healthy  subjects.  Renal  clearance  of  total  FF  was,  respectively, 
increased,  unchanged  and  decreased  in  subjects  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment,  as 
compared  to  healthy subjects.  However,  no linear  relationship  between the  degree  of  RI  and  the  renal 
clearance of total FF was detected. 
BDP systemic exposure, in terms of both AUC and Cmax, was lower in renal impaired patients as compared 
to healthy subjects. 
There were no treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the study nor any clinically relevant trends 
or changes from baseline in laboratory, vital signs or ECG parameters. In one male subject with moderate 
renal impairment, a QTcF interval of >450 ms was observed and in one female patient with moderate renal 
impairment, a QTcF of >470 ms was observed. However, neither of these subjects had an increase from 
baseline in QTcF of more than 30 ms. 
In  Triple  6  there  were  seven  (0.6%)  COPD  patients  exposed  to  Trimbow  with  renal  impairment  (one 
patient had normal renal function based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (according to EMEA 
CHMP/EWP/225/02), three had mild renal impairment, two had moderate renal impairment, and one had 
severe renal impairment). In total, there were 19 TEAEs in five (71.4%) patients with renal impairment 
exposed  to  Trimbow,  of  which  the  most common  was  COPD  exacerbation.  Two  serious  TEAEs  were 
reported in two (28.6%) patients; however, neither treatment emergent ADRs nor fatal events occurred in 
these patients.  
Clinical safety data in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment does not raise any specific concern 
and the safety profile is consistent with that in patients with normal renal function.  
•  Patients with hepatic impairment  
No specific studies of  Trimbow have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment.  BDP is bio 
transformed by esterase in the peripheral tissues (intestinal fluid, serum, lungs and liver) and there is no 
significant metabolism by the cytochrome system. Therefore, hepatic impairment is not expected to modify 
the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of BDP.  
FF is metabolised primarily via direct glucuronidation and is eliminated completely. A further route of 
biotransformation is O-demethylation followed by glucuronidation with subsequent complete elimination. 
Multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes catalyse the transformation (2D6, 2C19, 2C9 and 2A6) 
and  consequently  the  potential  for  metabolic  drug-drug  interaction  is  low.  As  formoterol  is  primarily 
eliminated via hepatic metabolism, an increased exposure can be expected in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment.  The  kinetics  of  FF  is  similar  after  single  and  repeated  administration,  indicating  no  auto-
induction or inhibition of metabolism.

GB is metabolised via hydroxylation which results in a variety of mono-and bis-hydroxylated metabolites. 
GB enzymatic hydrolysis resulting in the formation of a carboxylic acid derivative (CHF6006) is a minor 
metabolic  route,  whereas  chemical  hydrolysis  in  the  gut  lumen,  generates  CHF6006  that  is 
absorbed in the systemic circulation. In vitro investigations showed that CYP2D6 is involved in 
the oxidative biotransformation of GB. However, considering that GB is predominantly cleared by 
renal excretion, mild or moderate impairment of the hepatic metabolism of GB is not thought to result in 
a clinically relevant increase of systemic exposure. 
In Triple 6 there were 11 (1%) patients with hepatic impairment (five subjects had mild hepatic impairment 
and  six  were  not  evaluable).  In  total,  there  were  13  TEAEs  in  seven  (63.6%)  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment, of which the most common was COPD exacerbation. Three serious TEAEs were reported in 
two  (18.2%)  patients;  however,  neither  treatment  emergent  ADRs  nor  fatal  events  occurred  in  these 
patients.  
•  Patients with cardiovascular impairment 
Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular conditions, patients with AF and patients with clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities were excluded from the two pivotal studies.  
However, a specific study has been performed (CARSAF) to evaluate the cardiac safety of two doses of 
GB  (25  µg  and  50  µg  BID)  in  combination  with  Foster®  compared  to  Foster®  alone  in  patients  with 
moderate to severe COPD. Sixty-five patients received Foster® plus 25 µg, 63 received Foster® plus 50 µg 
and 63 received Foster® plus placebo. The results of this study demonstrated that heart rate, blood pressure 
and ECG parameters (including QTcF interval) were comparable across the three groups. No patients had 
a clinically significant prolongation of the QTcF interval. Serum concentration of potassium and glucose 
showed  similar  profiles  across  the  three  groups.  General  safety  (AEs  and  laboratory  parameters)  were 
comparable across the three groups.  
In  summary,  this  study  has  demonstrated  no  clinically  significant  differences  in  the  cardiac  safety  of 
Trimbow compared to FF combined with BDP.  
In the Triple 5 study, 476 (69%) out of 687 patients exposed to Trimbow had concomitant cardiovascular 
diseases. In Triple 6 there were 749 (69.5%) out of 1077 patients exposed to Trimbow that had concomitant 
cardiovascular diseases. In TRIMARAN study, 270 (46.9%) patients out of 576 exposed with Trimbow or 
Trimbow pMDI had a concomitant cardiovascular disease, whereas 273 (47.8) patients out of 571 exposed 
with Trimbow to Trimbow pMDI high strength in the TRIGGER study had a concomitant cardiovascular 
disease. Thus, patients with cardiovascular morbidities were well represented in the exposed population.  
Specific cardiac conditions will be considered as Important Potential Risk (cardio- and cerebrovascular 
events) in this RMP for Trimbow and the SmPC will provide specific information in relation to these risks 
and use in patients with concurrent cardiovascular conditions. 
•  Patients with a disease severity different from the inclusion criteria in the clinical trials   
In the pivotal clinical trials, patients with  COPD who had a history of at least one moderate or severe 
COPD  exacerbation  in  the  previous  12  months,  and  who  were  symptomatic  on  maintenance  COPD 
treatment with severe to very severe airflow limitation (GOLD stage III and IV) were included. There is 
no reason to consider that the safety profile of Trimbow would be different in patients with less severe 
disease. 
•  Sub-populations carrying relevant genetic polymorphisms 
to 
BDP undergoes a very rapid metabolism via esterase enzymes present in intestinal fluid, serum, lungs and 
liver 
the  more  polar  products:  beclometasone-21-monopropionate  (B21MP),  B17MP  and 
beclometasone;  therefore,  genetic  polymorphism  is  not  expected  to  modify  the  pharmacokinetics  and 
safety profile of BDP.

Formoterol  is  eliminated  primarily  by  metabolism,  direct  glucuronidation  being  the  major  pathway  of 
biotransformation,  with  O-demethylation  followed  by  further  glucuronidation  being  another  pathway. 
Minor  pathways  involve  sulphate  conjugation  of  formoterol  and  deformylation  followed  by  sulphate 
conjugation. Multiple isozymes catalyse the glucuronidation (UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10, 
2B7 and 2B15) and O-demethylation (CYP2D6, 2C19, 2C9, and 2A6) of formoterol, consequently it seems 
unlikely that even a major deficiency or excess activity of one (or even two) of those isoenzymes would 
have any significant effect on the overall PK or pharmacodynamics (PD). 
Multiple CYP isoenzymes contribute to the oxidative biotransformation of GB. Inhibition or induction of 
the metabolism of GB is unlikely to result in a relevant change of systemic exposure to the active substance. 
Renal elimination of parent drug accounts for about 60 to 70% of total clearance of systemically available 
GB whereas non-renal clearance processes, mainly by metabolism, account for about 30 to 40%.  
No studies are proposed in this area. 
•  Patients with relevant different ethnic origin 
The above remarks on genetic polymorphism of enzymes and GB metabolism are relevant here.

Method used to calculate exposure 
The patient exposure in the reference period was calculated from the available sales volumes in the countries 
where the product is marketed. Especially during the initial phase of a product to be launched in more than one 
market,  such  sales  data  may  overestimate  the  actual  exposure  by  assuming  that  all  wholesaler  stocks  are 
dispensed to patients, and also due to the fact that it does not account for patients non-compliance with the 
prescribed amount of dispensed drug (e.g., 2 puffs bid).  
SV.1.1.1 
Post-authorisation exposure (pMDI)  
Patient exposure for Trimbow has been estimated as to be approximately 949,779,015 patient treatment days 
(3,799,116,060 doses).  
No significant safety information concerning serious and non-serious ADRs, fatal cases, drug interactions, 
drug abuse or misuse, experience in special patient groups or during pregnancy or lactation, or effects of long-
term treatment, has been reported in the post-marketing experience.  
No significant regulatory/marketing authorisation holder (MAH) actions related to safety of Trimbow pMDI 
have been taken during the reporting interval that had a significant influence on the risk-benefit balance of the 
product. 
SV.1.1.2 
Post-authorisation exposure (DPI) 
Patient exposure for Trimbow has been estimated as to be approximately 42,920,700 patient treatment days

The safety profile of the product in both COPD and Asthma patients is unchanged.

SVI.1  Potential for misuse for illegal purposes  
Addiction  
It seems unlikely that the beneficial or adverse effects of  Trimbow would be perceived as pleasurable and 
therefore likely to stimulate addictive and associated behaviour. However, patients may find bronchodilators 
useful for symptoms relief and often become psychologically attached to them[63]. Chiesi is not aware of any 
resulting criminal activity. 
Other 
Trimbow has no observed effect on consciousness, memory or behaviour and it is difficult to imagine any 
illegal purposes to which it could potentially be put. Forcible administration of an overdose with malicious 
intent would be virtually impossible to achieve because of the required coordination of breathing and inhaler 
actuation.

Module SVII – Identified and potential risks  
Safety concerns assessed as associated with  Trimbow derived from the clinical and pre-clinical experience 
achieved with the product, and from the known safety profile of the BDP+FF component. In particular, for this 
latter, the approved and consolidated RMP of Foster® has been taken as reference. 
LAMA class effects have been also considered and following the CHMP and PRAC Rapporteurs' Day 150 
Joint Assessment Report received on 27 April 2017 (see section SVII.1) the glycopyrronium safety concern of 
“Cardio- and cerebrovascular events” was classified as an important potential risk for Trimbow.  
SVII.1  
Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission   
SVII.1.1.  Risk not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP 
SVII.1.1.1 
  Potential for harm from overdose 
Overdose may arise from: 
- 
incorrect prescription 
- 
incorrect labelling in the pharmacy 
-  misunderstanding by the patient 
- 
deliberate action by the patient, including the possibility of suicidal intent. 
With a metered dose inhaler, overdose is quite difficult to achieve, since a certain amount of coordination of 
breathing and operating the inhaler is required to deliver each dose correctly. Repeated firing of the inhaler 
without such coordination is unlikely to deliver any increased dose to the lungs. The effect of deposition of an 
excessive dose in the mouth and pharynx has not been investigated. It is noted that FF is rarely used orally but 
a dose of 40 μg (6.67 times the dose in Trimbow) was used in one open efficacy study in Chinese patients [60]. 
However, a patient experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD is frequently very tempted to take one or 
more  extra  doses  of  his/her  inhaler.  Whilst  one  extra  inhalation  may  perhaps  be  beneficial  in  some 
circumstances,  the  patient  dosage  instructions  should  clearly  state  that  the  prescribed  dose  should  not  be 
exceeded,  and  that  the  patient  should  seek  medical  help  if  the  condition  worsens  or  does  not  respond  to 
treatment. 
Quality  testing  of  Trimbow  pMDI  inhaler  demonstrated  conformity  with  quality  standards  in  all  tests 
performed and no issues with the device which may lead to overdose are expected from a quality point of view.  
Excessive  doses  of  FF  may  lead  to  effects  that  are  typical  of  β2-adrenergic  agonists:  nausea,  vomiting, 
headache,  tremor,  somnolence,  palpitations,  tachycardia,  ventricular  arrhythmias,  prolongation  of  QTc 
interval, metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia. 
In  case  of  overdose  of  FF,  supportive  and  symptomatic  treatment  is  indicated.  Serious  cases  should  be 
hospitalised. Use of cardioselective β-adrenergic blockers may be considered, but only with extreme caution 
since  the  use  of  β-adrenergic  blocker  medication  may  cause  bronchospasm.  Serum  potassium  should  be 
monitored. 
A single large dose of corticosteroids is not a medical emergency. There may be adrenal suppression but in the 
absence of continuing overdose, it is likely to resolve in a few days without treatment. 
As GB is a quaternary ammonium agent, symptoms of overdosage are peripheral rather than central in nature. 
High doses of GB may lead to anticholinergic signs and symptoms for which symptomatic treatment may be 
indicated.

Studies  of  the  active  components  of  Trimbow  pMDI  involving  testing  of  supra-therapeutic  doses  did  not 
demonstrate any untoward effects and, therefore, do not provide any evidence of harm from overdose.  
- 
More specifically: 
-  Clinical data on inhaled doses of Foster® up to twelve cumulative actuations (total BDP 1200 µg, FF 72 
µg) have been studied in asthmatic patients. The cumulative treatments did not cause any abnormal effect 
on vital signs and neither serious nor severe AEs were observed [61].   
In COPD patients, repeated inhaled administration of glycopyrronium bromide via dry powder inhaler at 
total doses of 100 and 200 μg once-daily for 28 days were generally well tolerated and associated with a 
frequency and distribution of adverse events similar to placebo [62].  
In  the  Trimbow  pMDI  development  programme,  three  studies (Glyco  2,  CARSAF  and  Triple  3)  were 
conducted in moderate to severe COPD patients treated with supra-therapeutic total daily doses of GB. 
Safety results showed that single-dose (in study Glyco 2, Part 1) and repeated doses (in studies CARSAF 
and Triple 3 and Glyco 2, Part 2) administrations of GB at 100 and 200 µg in study Glyco 2 (Part 1) and 
at 100 µg in studies CARSAF, Triple 3 and Glyco 2 (Part 2) were safe and well tolerated, thus supporting 
the tolerability of GB at a supra-therapeutic exposure.  
- 
SVII.1.1.2  Effect of device failure 
The device used with Trimbow pMDI is the same as other devices used in COPD and asthma and it is likely 
that the patient and their carers will be familiar with it. Any device failure could result in the administration of 
an incorrect dose with the risk of underdose or overdose. 
There is no reason to suppose that an overdose of  Trimbow would constitute any hazard different from an 
overdose of either or all three constituents. Therefore, the potential for harm from overdose was not considered 
as important risk for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. 
SVII.1.1.3  Potential for transmission of infectious agents 
The potential for transmission of infectious agents was not considered as important risk for inclusion in the list 
of safety concerns in the RMP, as there are no steps in the synthesis of the products that could lead to a risk of 
contamination  with  infectious  agents  nor  are  there  biotechnology  or  fermentation  processes  involved  in 
manufacture that could present any risk of residual contaminants. . 
SVII.1.1.4 
  Potential for medication errors  
Medication errors may arise from mistakes by the prescriber, dispenser and patient. 
There were no medication errors reported during clinical development. 
A certain amount of patient training is required to use a pMDI inhaler correctly, in order to coordinate inhaling 
a  deep  breath  and  operating  the inhaler at the  correct  moment.  It  is  noted that  the  technique  for  using the 
Trimbow  inhaler  is  similar  to  other  inhalers  used  in  the  treatment  of  COPD.  It  is  further  noted  that  many 
patients  for  whom  Trimbow  is  prescribed  are  likely  to  have  used  other  inhalers  previously  and  so  should 
experience little if any problem when using Trimbow. 
Medication errors are more likely if: 
- 
- 
the product name may be confused with another similar name; 
the packaging of the product is similar to that of another product. 
Chiesi has selected the trade name Trimbow® which is considered not to be easily confusable with any other 
current drug proprietary or generic name within the EEA.

All Chiesi product packaging has some similarities, the “company livery” but the display of the product name 
is in a clear and easily legible typeface.  
A single strength, posology, formulation and indication for Trimbow pMDI are proposed. Consideration has 
been  given  to  naming,  presentation,  labelling  and  instructions  for  use  in  order  to  minimise  the  risk  of 
medication errors.  
Therefore, the likelihood of medication errors and also of confusion with line extensions of Trimbow pMDI 
and other available therapies is minimal.  
The severity of the disease in COPD patients receiving Trimbow is such that these patients may be already 
treated  with  other  medicinal  products  administered  with  a  pMDI  similar  to  that  used  for  Trimbow.  Most 
patients and their carer are likely to be already very familiar with such inhalers and their correct use. 
Medication error was not considered as important risk for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. 
SVII.1.1.5 
  Potential for off-label use 
The  indication  for  Trimbow  pMDI  is  the  maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe 
COPD. 
There is the potential that Trimbow pMDI may be used for other chronic lung disease particularly asthma. 
BDP alone, FF alone and BDP in combination with FF are approved for use in asthma at the same doses as in 
Trimbow and thus there is a reasonable possibility that Trimbow could be used in such an indication.  
Based upon the known safety profile of Trimbow, it is anticipated that the safety when used for the indication 
of asthma in adults would be comparable to that for the indication of COPD. Moreover, clinical development 
in asthma is ongoing (currently Phase 3) at the same or higher doses than in COPD. Available safety data do 
not indicate any specific safety concern in asthma compared with COPD. Thus, potential for off-label use was 
not considered as important risk for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP.

Atrial fibrillation 
Increased risk of pneumonia in 
COPD patients  
There were no TEAEs in Triple 3.  
The cardiovascular safety profile of Trimbow pMDI was assessed in the focused 
short-term  study  CARSAF,  where  the  drug  was  administered  as  a  free 
combination of Foster® + GB pMDI 25 µg and 50 µg bid as well as in the long-
term pivotal studies Triple 5 and Triple 6. In all studies, changes in HR and QTcF 
were  minimal  and  comparable  between  the  triple  combinations  vs.  all  other 
treatments. 
QT prolongation/Torsades de Pointes is a serious condition which can result in 
fatal arrhythmia and they may have a negative impact on the benefit risk balance 
of the product. 
Therefore,  these  risks  were  considered  as  important  identified  risks  for  the 
purpose of this RMP. 
Agents used to improve pulmonary function, notably beta 2-adrenergic agonists 
and theophylline can cause tachyarrhythmias. Pulmonary symptoms in COPD 
may become worse with AF development, due to excessive, irregular heart rate, 
as well as reduced diastolic filling of the ventricles. Anticholinergic agents can 
inhibit the action of acetylcholine on peripheral cholinergic receptors present in 
autonomic  effector  cells  of  the  cardiac  muscle,  the  sinoatrial  node  and  the 
atrioventricular node.  
In the clinical trials, there were 2 TEADRs of atrial fibrillation in Triple 5. There 
was one TEADR of atrial fibrillation in Triple 3 (with Foster® plus GB 25 µg) 
and none in CARSAF (only one unrelated TEAE with Foster® plus GB 25 µg).  
Atrial fibrillation can cause significant disability and may negatively impact the 
patient’s quality of life. The patient may require long term medication (digoxin) 
or  in  some  cases  cardioversion.    Atrial  fibrillation  can  lead  to  serious 
complications like stroke, heart failure, hospitalisations and premature death.   
Atrial fibrillation may have also a negative impact on the benefit risk balance of 
the product. 
Therefore,  it  is  considered  as  important  identified  risk  for the  purpose  of  this 
RMP. 
There is good evidence supporting the effect of ICS on human pulmonary host 
defence, acting through several biological pathways, such as an inhibitory action 
on  macrophage  functions,  a  decrease  in  cytokine  production  and  nitric  oxide 
expression, which may lead to a failure to control infection[76]. 
The  basis  for  this  risk  Pneumonia  was  the  finding  in  a  non  Chiesi-sponsored 
clinical trial in patients with COPD treated with fluticasone. 
Review of data under Article 31, EMA has confirmed the risk of pneumonia with 
inhaled  corticosteroids  (ICS)  in  patients  with  COPD.  There  is  no  conclusive 
clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the risk among 
ICS products. 
There is some evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with increasing steroid 
dose, but this has not been demonstrated conclusively across all studies.  
Among the PRAC recommendation the risk of  Pneumonia should be added to 
the list of important safety concerns. 
In clinical trials, there were no TEADRs of pneumonia in Triple 5 or Triple 6.  
In Triple 5, the pneumonia rate per 1,000 patients per year was slightly higher in 
the Trimbow group than the Foster® group (38.9 vs 28.8). Due to the very low

frequency of this event, a small difference in the number of pneumonias in the 
two  treatment  groups  led  to  an  apparent  difference  in  pneumonia  rates  (in 
particular as projected to 1,000 patients). In addition, the comparison between 
these rates (performed assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events) 
did  not  reveal  any  statistically  significant  difference  between  treatments 
(p=0.332). In study Triple 5 both treatment groups were administered a product 
containing the same ICS at the same dose, in the same formulation, and via the 
same inhaler device with identical drug delivery performance and characteristics. 
Therefore, it is expected that the ICS-associated risk of pneumonia would be the 
same. This consideration, in turn, lends support to the fact that the differential 
rate of pneumonias observed in the trial is the result of the random variability.  
In  Triple  6,  the  pneumonia  rate  per  1,000 patients  per  year  was  lower  with 
Tiotropium  (20.5)  than  with  Trimbow pMDI  (29.2)  or  Foster®  pMDI  + 
Tiotropium (25.2). Compared to study Triple 5, the rate in study Triple 6 was 
lower  than  that  observed  in  patients  receiving  the  same  treatment  (38.9)  and 
similar to the rate in the Foster® pMDI group (28.8). Of note, the results on the  
Trimbow pMDI group were based on a larger number of patients in study Triple 
6  than  in  study  Triple  5  (1077  vs.  687  patients).No  relevant  trend  in  the 
pneumonia rate was observed in the analyses stratified by age and cardiovascular 
diseases in either study. 
In both studies, across all treatment groups, the  majority of pneumonias were 
community acquired pneumonia.  
There were no TEAEs of pneumonia in Triple 3 or CARSAF. 
Pneumonia  can  require  hospitalisation  and  can  be  fatal.  It  may  have  also  a 
negative impact on the benefit risk balance of the product. 
Therefore,  it  is  considered  as  important  identified  risk  for the  purpose  of  this 
RMP.  
In Triple 6 study, there were seven (0.6%) patients exposed to Trimbow pMDI 
with  renal  impairment  (one  patient  had  normal  renal  function  based  on  the 
estimated glomerular filtration rate according to EMEA CHMP/EWP/225/02), 
three had mild renal impairment, two had moderate renal impairment, and one 
had  severe  renal  impairment).  In  total,  there  were  19  TEAEs  in  5  (71.4%) 
patients with renal impairment exposed to Trimbow pMDI, of which the most 
common was COPD exacerbation. However, neither TEADRs nor fatal events 
occurred in these patients. 
In the study CCD-05993AA1-10, the degree of renal impairment had an impact 
on GB systemic exposure. The exposure tended to increase with decreasing renal 
function  and  this  effect  was  mainly  observed  in  subjects  with  severe  renal 
impairment. 
There is a possible increase in adverse reactions following increased systemic 
exposure of Glycopyrronium bromide at therapeutic doses when used in patients 
with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. 
This may have also a negative impact on the benefit risk balance of the product.  
Therefore,  it  is  considered  as  important  identified  risk  for the  purpose  of  this 
RMP.

on peripheral cholinergic receptors present in autonomic effector cells of 
the cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, and the atrioventricular node.  
In  the  context  of  an  inhaled  single-agent  anticholinergic  quaternary 
ammonium compound (NVA237) marketing authorisation application by 
a  different  Applicant  in  Europe,  the  CHMP  required  the  conduct  of  a 
PASS  to  assess  the  association  between  the  use  of  NVA237  and 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The objectives of this study are 
to  assess  the  incidence  rates  and  hazard  ratio  of  1)  cardiovascular  and 
cerebrovascular outcomes and 2) mortality among new users of inhaled 
NVA237  with  COPD  compared  to  new  users  of  comparator  drugs 
(LAMAs excluding NVA237) or LABAs with COPD. 
In Triple 5 and 6 studies, there were 16 and 20 events of major adverse 
cardiovascular event (MACEs), respectively. In Triple 5, the MACE rate 
per  1,000  patients  per  year  was  similar  with  both  Trimbow  pMDI  and 
Foster® pMDI (24.9 and 25.6, respectively). In Triple 6, the MACE rate 
per 1,000 patients per year was slightly higher with Tiotropium (23.5) than 
with Trimbow pMDI (19.5) and Foster® pMDI + Tiotropium (13.6).  
Cardio-and  cerebrovascular  events  can  cause  significant  disability  and 
may negatively impact the patient’s quality of life and in severe cases lead 
to hospitalisations and death. This may have also a negative impact on the 
benefit risk balance of the product.  
Therefore, it is considered as important potential risk for the purpose of 
this RMP.

Identification and benefit risk impact 
Off-label use in paediatric 
population in asthma indication 
Use in patients with hepatic 
impairment 
The  inclusion  criteria  in  the  clinical  development  programme  required  that 
enrolled subjects were a minimum of 18 years of age. Thus,  Trimbow has not 
been studied in children. 
There is the potential for off-label use of Trimbow pMDI for the indication of 
asthma. Whilst in the adult population it can be anticipated that the safety profile 
in asthma will be similar to that in COPD, this may not be the case if used in 
children with asthma.  
Doses of the three components in combination with an acceptable benefit/risk in 
asthmatic children have not been established. 
Accordingly, “Off label use in paediatric population in asthma indication” will 
be considered a Missing Information for Trimbow pMDI.  
No  specific  studies  of  Trimbow  have  been performed  in  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment.  
BDP  is  bio  transformed  by  esterase  in  the  peripheral  tissues  (intestinal  fluid, 
serum, lungs and liver) and there is no significant metabolism by the cytochrome 
system.  Therefore,  hepatic  impairment  is  not  expected  to  modify  the 
pharmacokinetics and safety profile of BDP.  
FF  is  metabolised  primarily  via  direct  glucuronidation  and  is  eliminated 
completely. A further route of biotransformation is O-demethylation followed by 
glucuronidation  with  subsequent  complete  elimination.  Multiple  cytochrome 
P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes catalyse the transformation (2D6, 2C19, 2C9 and 
2A6) and consequently the potential for metabolic drug-drug interaction is low. 
As  formoterol  is  primarily  eliminated  via  hepatic  metabolism,  an  increased

exposure  can  be  expected  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment.  The 
kinetics of FF is similar after single and repeated administration, indicating no 
auto-induction or inhibition of metabolism. 
GB is metabolised via hydroxylation which results in a variety of mono-and bis-
hydroxylated metabolites. GB enzymatic hydrolysis resulting in the formation of 
a  carboxylic  acid  derivative  (CHF6006)  is  a  minor  metabolic  route,  whereas 
chemical hydrolysis in the gut lumen, generates CHF6006 that is absorbed in the 
systemic circulation. In vitro investigations showed that CYP2D6 is involved in 
the  oxidative  biotransformation  of  GB.  However,  considering  that  GB  is 
predominantly cleared by renal excretion, mild or moderate impairment of the 
hepatic metabolism of GB is not thought to result in a clinically relevant increase 
of systemic exposure. 
In Triple 6 there were 11 (1%) patients with hepatic impairment (five subjects 
had mild hepatic impairment and six were not evaluable). In total, there were 13 
TEAEs in seven (63.6%) patients with hepatic impairment, of which the most 
common was COPD exacerbation. Three serious TEAEs were reported in two 
(18.2%)  patients;  however,  neither  treatment  emergent  ADRs  nor  fatal  events 
occurred in these patients.  
For the purpose of this RMP, in view of the small number of hepatically-impaired 
patients studied, “Use in patients with hepatic impairment” will be considered a

Administration  of  Trimbow  to  women  who  are  breast-feeding  or  during 
pregnancy  has  not  studied  in  the  clinical  program  and  was  considered  an

Due to the lack of information on effects of the active substances on the new-
born, a serious impact cannot be entirely ruled out. 
The impact on new-born is not known but could be at high risk. 
No pregnancies were reported in Triple 5 and Triple 6.

Clinical trials and literature. 
In Triple 5 study, five TEAEs were moderate and eleven severe.  In Triple 6 
study, one TEAE was mild, seven were moderate and twelve were severe. The 
haemorrhagic stroke in the CARSAF study was severe.  
In  the  TRIGGER  study,  two  TEAEs  were  severe  and  one  moderate.  In  the 
TRIMARAN study, two TEAEs were severe and 2 moderate.  
In  the  Triskel  study,  coronary  artery  stenosis  was  reported  in  (0.6%) one 
patient with BDP/FF 400/24 + GB 50: the event was moderate in intensity and 
resolved by the end of the study.  
Thrombosis  was  reported  in  (0.6%)  one patient  with  BDP/FF  400/24  + 
GB 100: this event was moderate in intensity and resolved by the end of the 
study. None of the events were considered related to study medication, nor did 
they lead to study medication discontinuation. 
All above mentioned cardio- and cerebrovascular events in Triple 5, Triple 6, 
TRIMARAN, TRIGGER and CARSAF were serious.

In Triple 5, the majority of TEAEs (12) resolved and four TEAEs were fatal.  
In Triple 6, ten TEAEs were fatal, four resolved with sequelae, four recovered, 
and two were not resolved. The haemorrhagic stroke in the CARSAF  study 
was fatal. 
In  the  TRIGGER  study,  there  was  one TEAE  of  cerebral haemorrhage  with 
Trimbow (high strength) which was fatal. The death was considered not related

Important Potential risk  
Cardio- and cerebrovascular events 
In  TRI-D  study  no  TEAEs  from  SOC  ‘Cardiac  Disorders’  was  found  for 
Trimbow  DPI,  while  2  (0.6%)  patients  experienced  a  TEAE  from  SOC 
‘Vascular Disorder’. 
The cardiovascular safety profile of Trimbow DPI was assessed in the TRI-D 
study and the frequency of cardiac and vascular events was found to be low 
and similar among treatments. Assessment of ECG parameters found changes 
from baseline in HR and QTcF to be minimal and similar among treatments. 
Taken together, these observations indicated that the slightly higher GB Cmax 
of  Trimbow  DPI  in  comparison  to  pMDI  with  VHC  in  the  PK  study  had  a 
limited impact on cardiovascular safety following short-term use (4 weeks). 
Cardiovascular disease is a major comorbidity in COPD. Sixteen percent of 
COPD  patients  had  coronary  heart  disease,  compared  to  6%  of  non-COPD 
patients[31]. Likewise, the prevalence of myocardial infarction, stroke and CHF 
were higher in COPD patients.  
De Lucas-Ramos et al. (Spain) showed that compared with the control group, 
the COPD group showed a significantly higher prevalence of ischemic heart 
disease (12.5% versus 4.7%; P<0.0001)[36]. Feary et al. reported that 28% and 
9.9%  of  COPD  patients  had  cardiovascular  disease  and  stroke  compared  to 
7.2% and 3.2%, respectively, in subjects without COPD[77].    
There are many risk factors associated with coronary heart disease and stroke 
like  family  history,  ethnicity  and  age.    Other  risk  factors  include  smoking, 
hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, unhealthy 
diets, and harmful use of alcohol.  
Information given in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Cardio-and  cerebrovascular  events  can  cause  significant  disability  and  may 
negatively  impact  the  patient’s  quality  of  life  and  in  severe  cases  lead  to 
hospitalisations and death. 
The  incidence  of  serious  cardio-and  cerebrovascular  events  as  an  ADR  to 
Trimbow was very low. 
The impact on the benefit risk balance is not expected to be significant due to 
the well-known class effect. Nevertheless, the risk needs to be monitored on 
routine  basis.  In  order  to  further  evaluate  the  potential  cardiovascular  and 
cerebrovascular  safety  risk  related  to  long-term  use  of  Trimbow  DPI  vs. 
Trimbow  pMDI,  a  PASS  is  proposed.  This  non-interventional  study  will 
primarily assess the incidence of MACE among new users of Trimbow DPI 
vs. Trimbow pMDI. 
The  public  health  impact  is  likely  to  be  small  based  on  to  the  incidence  of 
serious  cardio-and  cerebrovascular  events  as  an  ADR  to  Trimbow,  so  the 
eventual impact on the public health is expected to be limited.

for  Trimbow® 
(Beclometasone 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Trimbow®/Riarify®/Trydonis®. The RMP details 
important risks of Trimbow®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Trimbow® 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Trimbow®'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Trimbow® should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Trimbow® should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Trimbow®'s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what is it used for? 
Trimbow® is authorised for the following indications and strengths in the EEA: 
COPD: 
<Trimbow 87/5/9>(Pressurised Metered Dose Inhalation or pMDI)> 
<Trimbow 88/5/9(Dry Powder Inhaler or DPI)> 
Trimbow® is authorised for the maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled 
corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2-agonist or a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a long-
acting muscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations (see SmPC 
for the full indication).  
Asthma: 
<Trimbow 87/5/9>(Pressurised Metered Dose Inhalation or pMDI)> 
Trimbow® 87/5/9 Medium Strength (MS) is authorised for the maintenance treatment of asthma, in adults 
not adequately controlled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and medium dose 
of inhaled corticosteroid, and who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. (see 
SmPC for the full indication). 
<Trimbow 172/5/9>(Pressurised Metered Dose Inhalation or pMDI)> 
Trimbow® 172/5/9 High strength (HS) is authorised for the maintenance treatment of asthma, in adults not 
adequately  controlled  with  a  maintenance  combination  of  a  long-acting  beta2-agonist  and  high  dose  of

inhaled corticosteroid, and who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. (see 
SmPC for further details). 
Trimbow®  contains  beclometasone  dipropionate,  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  and  glycopyrronium  as 
active substances and is given by inhalation. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Trimbow/Riarify/Trydonis  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Trimbow/Riarify/Trydonis EPAR, including its plain language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/trimbow. 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of Trimbow® together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Trimbow®’ s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package leaflet 
and product information addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the medicine 
is used correctly; 
•  The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.,  with  or  without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A   List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Trimbow® are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as 
identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use 
of Trimbow®/Riarify®/Trydonis®. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
It is known that other Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists drugs (LAMA) 
such  as  glycopyrronium  bromide,  have  been  associated  with  effects  on  the 
heart  and  cerebrovascular  events  (stroke).  During  clinical  studies  with 
Trimbow®, cases of cardio-and cerebrovascular have been reported. 
There are many risk factors associated with coronary heart disease and stroke 
like  family  history,  ethnicity  and  age.    Other  risk  factors  include  smoking, 
hypertension,  high  cholesterol,  obesity,  physical 
inactivity,  diabetes, 
unhealthy diets, and harmful use of alcohol. 
Routine activities to further investigate and to minimise the risk are necessary. 
In  addition,  information on  the  risk  is  stated  in  sections  4.4  and  4.8  of  the 
SmPC and in sections 2 and 4 of the leaflet. 
In  order  to  assess  and  address  the  important  potential  risk  of  cardio  and 
cerebrovascular events, a post-authorisation safety study is planned (PASS). 
The  proposed  PASS  study  is  related  to  the  long-term  use  of  Dry  Powder 
Inhaler vs. Pressurised Metered Dose Inhaler.

A post-authorisation safety study (PASS) is planned to perform further evaluation of the important 
potential risk of heart diseases and stroke (cardio and cerebrovascular events) for DPI dosage. 
 Study  short  name:  Multinational  database  cohort  study  to  assess  adverse  cardiovascular  and 
cerebrovascular outcomes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease initiating a fixed triple 
therapy containing beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate and glycopyrronium administered via 
dry powder inhaler (DPI) compared to pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI).  
Purpose of the study:  A post-authorisation safety study (PASS) is planned to perform further evaluation 
of  the important  potential risk  of  heart  diseases  and stroke (cardio  and  cerebrovascular  events)  for  DPI 
dosage.  
Primary Objective: 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  will  be  to  assess  the  incidence  of  ‘Major  Adverse  Cardiovascular 
Events’ (MACEs), defined as any of the following events: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Myocardial infarction; 
Stroke (ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke); 
Hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome; 
Hospitalization due to heart failure. 
Secondary Objectives: 
The secondary objectives of the study will be to assess separately the incidence of each of the following 
specific events: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Myocardial infarction;  
Cerebrovascular disorders (ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack); 
Hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome; 
Hospitalization due to heart failure; 
Arrhythmias (new-sustained supraventricular and sustained ventricular); 
All-cause death .

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Plegridy 
peginterferon beta-1a 
On  15  October  2020,  the  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  adopted  a  positive 
opinion  recommending  a  change  to  the  terms  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for  the  medicinal  product 
Plegridy. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Biogen Netherlands B.V. 
The CHMP recommended the addition of a new route of administration (intramuscular use) for an existing 
formulation  (125  micrograms  in  0.5  ml)  already  authorised  for  subcutaneous  use.  The  recommended 
indication for intramuscular use is the same as the currently authorised indication for Plegridy and is as 
follows: 
Plegridy is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR) 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

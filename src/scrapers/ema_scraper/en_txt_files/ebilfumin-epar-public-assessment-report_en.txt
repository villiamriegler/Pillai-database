1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Actavis Group PTC ehf submitted on 23 April 2013 a Marketing Authorisation 
application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ebilfumin, through the centralised 
procedure under Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 – ‘Generic of a Centrally 
authorised product’. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the 
EMA/CHMP on 20 March 2014. 
The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and refers to a reference medicinal product for which a Marketing Authorisation is 
or has been granted in the Union on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 
8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
• 
Treatment of influenza 
In  patients  one  year  of  age  and  older  who  present  with  symptoms  typical  of  influenza, 
when influenza virus is circulating in the community.  
Ebilfumin  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  infants  less  than  1  year  of  age  during  a 
pandemic  influenza  outbreak  (see  section  5.2).  The  treating  physician  should  take  into 
account  the  pathogenicity  of  the  circulating  strain  and  the  underlying  condition  of  the 
patient to ensure there is a potential benefit to the child. 
• 
Prevention of influenza 
Post-exposure  prevention  in  individuals  1  year  of  age  or  older  following  contact  with  a 
clinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community. 
The  appropriate  use  of  Ebilfumin  for  prevention  of  influenza  should  be  determined  on  a 
case  by  case  basis  by  the  circumstances  and  the  population  requiring  protection.  In 
exceptional  situations  (e.g.  in  case  of  a  mismatch  between  the  circulating  and  vaccine 
virus  strains,  and  a  pandemic  situation)  seasonal  prevention  could  be  considered  in 
individuals one year of age or older. 
Ebilfumin is indicated for post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age 
during a pandemic influenza outbreak (see section 5.2). 
Ebilfumin is not a substitute for influenza vaccination. 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Generic application (Article 10(1) of Directive No 2001/83/EC). 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data and 
a bioequivalence study with the reference medicinal product Tamiflu instead of non-clinical and 
clinical unless justified otherwise.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Influenza is an acute viral infection that spreads easily from person to person and can affect 
anybody in any age group. Influenza circulates worldwide and causes annual epidemics that peak 
during winter in temperate regions. Influenza is thus a serious public health problem that causes 
severe illnesses and deaths for higher risk populations.  
There are three types of seasonal influenza – A, B and C. Type A influenza viruses are further 
typed into subtypes according to different kinds and combinations of virus surface proteins. 
Among many subtypes of influenza A viruses, currently influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes 
are circulating among humans. 
Seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, cough (usually dry), 
headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat and runny nose. The incubation 
period is about two days. 
The most effective way to prevent the disease or severe outcomes from the illness is vaccination.  
In addition, antiviral drugs for treatment and prevention of influenza are available. There are two 
classes of such medicines, 1) adamantanes (amantadine and remantadine), and 2) inhibitors of 
influenza neuraminidase (oseltamivir and zanamivir). 
Ebilfumin (oseltamivir), a neuraminidase inhibitor, ATC Code: J05AH02, is a generic of the 
originator product Tamiflu. The active metabolite is a selective inhibitor of influenza virus 
neuraminidase enzymes, which are glycoproteins found on the virion surface. Viral 
neuraminidase enzyme activity is important both for viral entry into uninfected cells and for the 
release of recently formed virus particles from infected cells, and for the further spread of 
infectious virus in the body.  
Ebilfumin is indicated for the treatment and prevention of influenza in patients one year of age 
and older and for the treatment and prevention of influenza in patients less than one year of age 
during a pandemic influenza outbreak. The indication proposed for Ebilfumin is the same as 
authorised for the Reference medicinal product.

ethyl 
propoxy)cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate phosphate and has the following structure: 
Ebilfumin 
Assessment report  
EMA/260303/2014 
Page 7/34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The structure of oseltamivir phosphate has been confirmed by means of CHN analysis, DSC 
analysis, UV, FT-IR, 1H NMR and mass spectroscopy.  
Oseltamivir phosphate is a white or almost white powder, slightly hygroscopic and freely soluble 
in water and in methanol, practically insoluble in methylene chloride.  
Oseltamivir phosphate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres; 
eight stereoisomers are therefore possible. The manufacturer consistently produces the R, R, S 
isomer. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by specific optical rotation. 
Several polymorphic forms exist of oseltamivir phosphate. Comparison of FT-IR spectra and 
Powder X-ray diffractogram with data of literature ensures that crystalline form A of oseltamivir 
phosphate is consistently manufactured. Form A was found to be the most stable form and easily 
formed. Stability studies of the active substance and finished product indicate no transition to a 
different polymorph.  
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master 
File (ASMF) procedure. 
There is a monograph of oseltamivir phosphate in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
Manufacture 
The active substance is sourced from one manufacturer.  
Oseltamivir phosphate is synthesized in six main steps using a well-defined starting material with 
acceptable specification. No reprocessing, reworking or blending of batches is performed. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities (including potential genotoxic 
impurities) are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, optical 
rotation), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy 
metals (Ph.Eur.), and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
All parameters included in the specification are in line with the current Ph. Eur. monograph and 
applicable guidance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data of three commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market  
for 36 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stress and forced degradation studies have been performed. Oseltamivir phosphate is very 
sensitive to base, sensitive to acid, peroxide and water at 60 °C and only slightly sensitive to 
thermal effects and sun light. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification, water content, related 
substances, assay and polymorphism. The analytical methods used were the same as for release 
and were stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed 
container and storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the development was to formulate hard gelatin capsules of oseltamivir with 30 mg, 45 
mg and 75 mg bioequivalent to the reference product Tamiflu.  
The pharmaceutical development was focused on: dose-proportional composition of 30 mg, 45 
mg and 75 mg strengths; fast disintegration of the capsule with fast release and dissolution of 
the active substance; use of excipients described in the European Pharmacopoeia and compatible 
with the active substance and the definition of critical process parameters. 
The qualitative composition and pharmaceutical form of Ebilfumin are the same as the reference 
product.  
Ebilfumin 
Assessment report  
EMA/260303/2014 
Page 9/34 
 
  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The Ebilfumin application concerns three strengths (30, 45 and 75 mg). A bioequivalence study 
has been performed on the 75 mg strength. The dissolution profiles of the Ebilfumin 75 mg 
capsule and of the reference Tamiflu 75 mg used in the bioequivalence study have been 
compared in order to demonstrate similarity.  
The dissolution profiles of the other two strengths have also been compared to Ebilfumin 75 mg 
which has been used in the bioequivalence study (biobatch) as per the Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr). Please also refer to 
2.4.1 of this report.” 
Dissolution studies of the three strengths performed in the physiological range (pH 1.1, pH 4.5 
and pH 6.8) confirmed that more than 85 % of the active substance dissolved within 15 minutes, 
similarly to the reference product. The batch used for the bioequivalence studies was 
manufactured at pilot scale but according to the commercial manufacturing process. 
The suitability of the dissolution method used for batch release has been demonstrated. 
A 6-month stability study demonstrated a similar impurity profile between Ebilfumin and the 
reference product.  
The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PVDC/Al blisters or HDPE containers with LDPE lid (and a 
desiccant). The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
The pharmaceutical development section is adequately drawn up and contains all relevant data. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. A valid TSE CEP from the suppliers 
of the gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps: blending, wet granulation, blending of 
extragranular components, capsule filling and packaging.  The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this 
pharmaceutical form.  
Ebilfumin 
Assessment report  
EMA/260303/2014

Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form, 
i.e. appearance, identification (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
disintegration (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (UV) and microbiological quality 
(Ph. Eur.).  
Batch analysis results are provided for two pilot batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of two pilot batches of each strength of the finished product stored under long term 
conditions for 12 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 
40 ºC / 75% RH, and  for up to 9 months under intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are 
representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in primary packaging 
representative of those proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, disintegration, assay, related substances, dissolution and 
microbial quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life the 30, 4 and 75 mg hard capsule as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable. 
In addition, satisfactory stability studies to support the shelf lives of pharmacy compounded 
suspensions as described in the SmPC were provided. All information regarding these pharmacy 
compounding suspensions, including dose recommendations for infants less than one year is 
therefore substantiated. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical 
use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been 
provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies 
why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference 
product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. Justification was provided by the applicant 
based on the assumption that there will be no significant increase of the amount of the active 
substance on the market and, therefore, no significant increase of environmental exposure. The 
CHMP agreed with this justification. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of oseltamivir are well known. 
As oseltamivir is a widely used and well-known active substance, the Applicant did not provide 
additional non-clinical studies. Initial concerns about search-methodology were satisfactorily 
addressed. The CHMP did not consider that further non-clinical studies are necessary and that 
the overview based on literature review is appropriate.  
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is 
adequate. The MAH did not provide an ERA arguing that no increase in utilisation of the active 
substance is expected due to this generic application. The CHMP considered the applicant’s 
justification for omission of any further environmental risk assessment acceptable. Section 5.3 of 
the SmPC is in line with the originator SmPC of Tamiflu.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided an overview on human pharmacology, efficacy and safety. Human 
pharmacology, efficacy and safety of oseltamivir are well known. The overview was based on 
appropriate scientific literature. In general, the clinical aspects of the generic product SmPC are 
in accordance with the reference product SmPC. 
This is an application for hard capsules containing oseltamivir. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study with randomized, open 
label, two treatments, four periods, two sequences and cross-over fully replicate design under 
fasting conditions. This study is the pivotal study for supporting the application. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Exemption  
The bioequivalence study was conducted with the 75 mg strength only. A biowaiver was 
requested for Ebilfumin 30 mg and Ebilfumin 45 mg. 
General biowaiver-criteria are fulfilled according to the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) Rev. 1.: 
1. The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process. 
2. The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same.  
• 
• 
The composition of the strengths is quantitatively proportional (Table 1) 
In vitro dissolution data are available and show similar dissolution rates (Table 2).

Table 2: Comparison of dissolution profiles of Ebilfumin 30, 45 and 75 mg 
The pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range is linear. Therefore, one bioequivalence 
study with the highest dose of 75 mg and a biowaiver for the additional strengths is considered 
adequate. 
Results of in vitro dissolution tests of the bio-batches of the test product vs. reference product 
at three different buffers (pH 1.1, 4.5 and 6.8) reflect bioequivalence. More than 85 % of the 
drug is dissolved within 15 minutes at all pH values tested for test and reference product  
Hence, similarity of dissolution profiles can be accepted as demonstrated without any further 
mathematical calculation. 
For the reference product Tamiflu dissolution profiles were conducted for the 75mg strength. 
Results correspond to CHMP recommendations. Dissolution profiles of test and reference 
products are comparable (see figures on dissolution comparison of biobatches).

More than 85 % of the drug is dissolved within 15 minutes for all batches at all conditions. The 
dissolution profiles are therefore accepted as similar without further mathematical evaluation in 
compliance with Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWPQWP/1401/98 Rev.

Methods 
Study design  
Study No. 2603/11 was a randomized, open label, two treatment, four period, two sequence, 
single dose, crossover, fully replicate, bioequivalence study of Oseltamivir 75 mg capsules of 
Actavis Group PTC ehf, Iceland and Tamiflu (oseltamivir) 75 mg hard capsules of Roche 
Registration Limited, UK, in healthy adult subjects, under fasting conditions. Bioanalytical 
analysts were blinded to the randomization during the course of the analysis and until the results 
were processed by the statistical department and reported.  
The study was conducted at Lotus Labs Pvt. Ltd., Mylapore, Chennai, India from 17 September 
2012 to 28 September 2012. The study report is dated 27 November 2012. 
A total of 32 healthy adult male subjects were enrolled into the study. Subjects were randomized 
into one of two sequences, each consisting of four periods [sequences TRTR resp. RTRT; T=

capsules of Roche Registration Limited]. Subjects were housed from the time of check-in (at 
least 11 hours before dosing) until after the 24 hours post dose blood draw in each period. After 
a supervised overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a single oral dose of the study product was 
administered with 240 mL of water. Subjects were dosed with the test or the reference product 
in each period as determined by the randomization schedule under fasting conditions. The 0.000 
h sample was collected within a period of 1 hour before dosing and the post-dose blood samples 
were collected at 0.167, 0.333, 0.500, 0.750, 1.000, 1.250, 1.500, 1.750, 2.000, 2.500, 3.000, 
3.500, 4.000, 6.000, 8.000, 12.000, 16.000 and 24.000 h after dosing in each period. 
Treatments were separated by a washout period of 3 days.

The batch size of the test product is in line with the guidelines, in which a batch size is requested 
of at least 100.000 tablets and over 1/10th of the commercial batch size (132.000 – 1.320.000 
capsules) and therefore appropriate. 
Certificates of analysis for the test- and reference product were provided. The actual amount of 
oseltamivir phosphate according to the CoA was 73.5 mg for the test product and 72.4 mg for 
the reference product which is within the range of +/- 5%. 
Results of in vitro dissolution tests of the bio-batches of the test product vs. reference product at 
three different buffers (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) reflect bioequivalence. More than 85% of the drug is 
dissolved within 15 minutes at all pH values tested for test and reference product (see 
information related to Exemption). 
The applicant confirmed that the test product used in the bioequivalence study is identical to the 
product intended for marketing. The reference product was obtained from the UK market.

Population(s) studied   
A total of 32 healthy adult male subjects were enrolled into the study. With the expected 
coefficient of variation for Cmax not exceeding 30% and assuming the true ratio of Cmax and AUC 
falling within 95% to 105%, the study should have at least 26 evaluable subjects to show 
bioequivalence with a power of 90% at a 5% level of significance. Expecting dropouts in the 
study 6 additional subjects were planned to be included in the study.  32 subjects were 
randomized to either test or reference product sequence in the four periods of the study. Three 
subjects dropped out and thus 29 subjects received both the test and reference products twice in 
the four periods and completed the study. However, 31 subjects completed at least 2 periods of 
the study, one for each formulation. 
One subject did not check-in for period II, one subject was withdrawn due to AE (Decrease in 
Haemoglobin) and one subject did not check in for period IV.  
Subjects had to be healthy, adult subjects (of either sex), aged between 18 and 45 years 
(inclusive); body mass indices between 18.5 and 30.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).  
All subjects had to be in compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the 
protocol and were judged eligible for enrolment in this study, based on demographic data, 
medical history, general physical examination including vital signs measurements, ECG, chest X-
ray, haematology, biochemistry, serology as well as urine analysis. 
The subjects enrolled in the study were South Asians. There was no direct data available on 
Oseltamivir and its metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate for comparison from Caucasian population 
to the observed data in the current study but the applicant discussed adequately the influence of 
major drug metabolizing enzymes on Oseltamivir. The South Asians (India, Bangladesh, and 
Pakistan) are similar to Caucasians as far as the distribution and activity of major drug 
metabolizing enzymes are concerned. 
Davies (2010) stated that “Overall, there are no clinically relevant differences in the 
pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir or OC between healthy volunteers and infected patients; this 
applies in adults of different sexes, ages and weights. Equally, ethnicity does not appear to affect 
the pharmacokinetics of the prodrug or active metabolite.”  
The main purpose of using a cross over design was to provide a basis for separating treatment 
effects from other effects like gender or ethnicity. The influence of known or unknown 
confounding covariates is strongly reduced because each crossover patient serves as his or her 
own control.  
Analytical methods   
The  analyte  was  oseltamivir  phosphate,  which  is  a  prodrug  of  the  active  metabolite  oseltamivir 
carboxylate. 
Internal standard was Oseltamivir-D3; samples were extracted from a 500 µL aliquot of sodium 
fluoride and potassium oxalate human plasma by solid-phase extraction. The extracted samples 
were  injected  into  a  liquid  chromatograph;  detection  method  used  was  tandem  mass 
spectrometry detector.

Quantitation  is  determined  by  peak  area  ratio  method.  A  weighted  (1/x2)  linear  regression  is 
performed to determine the concentration of the analytes. 
The  validated  calibration  range  for  the  assay  of  oseltamivir  phosphate  is  from  0.498  ng/mL  to 
131.211 ng/mL. 
Sample  reassays  /  repeats  for  oseltamivir  were  done  on  10  samples  (0.43%  of  total  study 
samples);  7  samples  were  reassayed  due  to  sample  concentration  above  upper  limit  of 
quantitation; 3 samples were reassayed due to variation in internal standard. All reassays are in 
accordance with the presented SOP and the relevant guideline. 
Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) of oseltamivir has been performed on 178 samples (~ 7.68% of 
total  samples  analysed);  177  out  of  178  ISR  samples  (~99.44%)  were  within  20%  from  the 
mean value. 
Representative chromatograms (subjects 11-14, 16-17, ~18.75%) were provided. 
The  analytical  method  for  the  determination  of  oseltamivir  in  human  plasma  and  respective 
validations  are  described  adequately;  the  validation  was  basically  performed  according  to  the 
requirements 
of 
the 
EMA 
“Guideline 
on 
bioanalytical  method 
validation” 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). Acceptance criteria are in a plausible range and were fulfilled. 
Provided chromatograms are acceptable; ISR has been investigated satisfactory. 
The  pro-drug  oseltamivir  phosphate  was  measured  for  all  pharmacokinetic-analyses.  This 
approach  is  endorsed  considering  the  parent  compound  being  more  sensitive  to  detect 
differences between formulations in absorption rate. 
The  bioanalytical  method  demonstrates  acceptable  performance  and  is  suitable  for  the 
determination of oseltamivir in human plasma over the calibration range. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The following parameters were calculated: 
1.  AUC0-t using the linear trapezoidal rule 
2.  AUC0-¥ by adding the quantity Clast/Kel to AUC0-t. 
3.  Cmax 
The primary endpoints are defined as AUC0-t and Cmax. 
Statistical methods   
Log-transformed  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  to  be  analyzed  using  a  linear  mixed-effects 
model. The model included treatment, period and sequence as fixed effects and subjects nested 
within  sequence  as  random  effect.  Individual  AUC  parameters  were  calculated  using  the 
trapezoidal rule. Differences of LSMeans were to be calculated for log-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-
inf  and  Cmax  values.  90%  confidence  intervals  for  these  differences  were  to  be  calculated,  and 
further be expressed by taking the antilog of the values obtained in order to get 90% confidence 
intervals  on  the  normal  scale.  The  90%  confidence  interval  was  to  lie  within  80%  to  125%  for 
Ebilfumin

AUC0-t.  For  Cmax  the  90%-confidence  interval  was  to  lie  within  an  acceptance  range  79.70%-
125.46%, defined according to the reference intra-subject variability (ISCV).

Based on the obtained pharmacokinetic parameters of oseltamivir, the reference and test 
product are considered bioequivalent with respect to the extent and rate of absorption. The 
90% confidence intervals for AUC0-t and Cmax are within the predefined acceptance ranges. 
The mean residual area was lower than 20% for all treatments indicating that the duration of 
sampling was sufficient. 
Safety data 
There  were  four  adverse events  reported  in the  study  which  all  four  were  considered  related to 
study  products.  The  following  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  reported  during the  study:  Headache, 
body  pain  and  decrease  in  haemoglobin.  Among  the  four  related  adverse  events,  one  adverse 
event  was  assessed  to  be  related  to  the  test  product,  two  adverse  events  were  assessed  to  be 
related to the reference product and one adverse event (decrease in haemoglobin in one subject) 
could not be attributed to either the test or the reference product as the abnormal lab result was 
detected during the end of period II study safety procedure and evaluation of safety lab results. 
All  adverse  events  were  moderate  in  intensity  except  one  AE  which  was  mild  in  intensity  and 
resolved completely without sequelae. There were no serious adverse events in the study. 
The safety profile of the test product is acceptable and comparable with the safety profile of the 
reference product. Both formulations were well tolerated, with no major side effects.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this 
application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product subject of the generic application 
has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **) the study design of the BE-study 2603/11 is 
appropriate for an immediate release product and the pharmacokinetic variables studied are 
adequate. 
The general biowaiver criteria are met and the pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range 
is linear. Therefore, a biowaiver for the additional strengths (30 mg and 45 mg) is acceptable. 
The methodological aspects of the design of study 2603/11 are fully appropriate. This applies to 
the single-dose cross-over as well as the fully replicate study design. A replicate study design 
was necessary, as the Applicant had pre-planned for possible widening of the bioequivalence 
criteria for Cmax in line with EMA Guideline CPMP/EWPQWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr **. An open 
label-design is acceptable, but the blinding of the bioanalytical analyst is considered necessary 
and therefore supported. 
The sample size justification did not consider the 2 sequence, four period study design. However, 
the approach was conservative and is considered acceptable. The CV used for sample size 
calculation was very much in line with the CV finally observed in the study. The final analysis 
included all subjects with a sufficient number of evaluable samples, i.e. out of the 32 subjects 
included into the trial only one subject was excluded from the statistical analyses, as this subject 
did not have PK values for both treatments. This approach is in line with EMA Guideline 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr ** and therefore is considered appropriate. 
The statistical analysis model applied was not fully pre-specified in the study protocol, as it 
turned out during the responses submitted during the evaluation. While this is considered a 
deficiency it is nevertheless concluded that the model allowing for a subject-by-formulation 
interaction resulted in conservative estimates in support of bioequivalence and thus the results 
are acceptable. The primary endpoints are appropriately defined as AUC0-t and Cmax in line with 
the EMA Guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr **. The calculation of the 90% 
confidence intervals as well as the equivalence acceptance ranges are in line with EMA guidance. 
The rules for widening the acceptance range for Cmax are appropriately defined and with an 
observed ISCV of 30.52% for the reference it is appropriate that the acceptance range for Cmax 
can be widened to 79.70%-125.46%. Though it is not fully clear how the ISCV for the reference 
was estimated, any considerations on widening are not relevant as the 90% confidence interval 
for Cmax lies clearly within the standard 80%-125% acceptance range.

The selection of healthy volunteers as study population is in line with the BE Guideline and is 
considered ethical with regard to the study medication. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
clearly stated in the protocol as well as the criteria for subject withdrawal. Furthermore, criteria 
for restrictions, prohibitions, concomitant medication, subject screening, investigations and post 
study procedures are defined. 
The reported protocol deviations and the deviations in the blood sampling schedule are not 
considered relevant for the overall results. 
The withdrawal of one subject due to AE is in line with the defined criteria and considered 
appropriate. 
No gender specific effects are stated in the innovator’s SmPC or in the published literature. 
Davies (2010) stated that “Overall, there are no clinically relevant differences in the 
pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir or OC between healthy volunteers and infected patients; this 
applies in adults of different sexes, ages and weights. Equally, ethnicity does not appear to affect 
the pharmacokinetics of the prodrug or active metabolite.” 
In order to obtain a study population as homogenous as possible the non-inclusion of females in 
the BE study may be justified and accepted. The applicant also discussed the impact of a fully 
replicate crossover study design on ethnic, gender or race differences.  
The main purpose of using a cross over design was to provide a basis for separating treatment 
effects from other effects like gender or ethnicity. The influence of known or unknown 
confounding covariates is strongly reduced because each crossover patient serves as his or her 
own control. Therefore, the Applicant argued that establishing bioequivalence in one ethnic group 
can be bridged to other ethnic groups. In conclusion, the bioequivalence study conducted in 
South Asians was justified and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The  objective  of  the  provided  pharmacokinetic  study  was  to  assess  the  bioequivalence  of 
Oseltamivir  75  mg  hard  capsules  manufactured  by  Actavis  and  Tamiflu  75  mg  hard  capsules  of 
Roche Registration Limited, UK, in healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions. 
Based  on  the  results  obtained  Oseltamivir  75  mg  hard  capsules  of  Actavis  Group  PTC  ehf., 
Iceland  and  Tamiflu  75  mg  capsules  of  Roche  Registration  Limited,  UK,  are  considered 
bioequivalent.  The  results  of  study  2603/11  with  75  mg  formulation  can  be  extrapolated to the 
other strengths (30 mg and 45 mg), according to conditions outlined in the relevant Guidelines. 
The  safety  of  the  formulations  was  also  assessed  on  the  basis  of  clinical  and  laboratory 
examinations  at  different  time  points  at  the  beginning,  during  and  at  the  end  of  the  study  and 
registration  of  adverse  events  and/or  adverse  drug  reactions.  The  test  and  reference  product 
were clinically comparable in their safety profile. 
The application contains also an adequate review of published clinical data. 
All data regarding safety and efficacy available of the reference medicinal product also apply for 
this generic product.

oseltamivir-
Oseltamivir-resistant viruses isolated from oseltamivir-treated 
proposed 
induced viral 
patients and oseltamivir-resistant laboratory strains of 
resistance 
influenza viruses have been found to contain mutations in N1 
and N2 neuraminidases. Resistance mutations tend to be viral 
sub-type specific. Since 2007 resistance associated H275Y 
mutation in seasonal H1N1 strains has become widespread. 
The susceptibility to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such 
viruses appear to vary seasonally and geographically. In 
2008, H275Y was found in > 99 % of circulating H1N1 
influenza isolates in Europe. The 2009 H1N1 influenza (“swine 
flu”) was almost uniformly susceptible to oseltamivir, with 
only sporadic reports of resistance in connection with both

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Psychiatric disorders and nervous system disorders 
Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and 
behavioural symptoms which can include events such as 
hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behaviour, in some 
cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in 
the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur 
without obvious severe disease. 
In patients with influenza who were receiving Oseltamivir, 
there have been postmarketing reports of convulsions and 
delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of 
consciousness, confusion, abnormal behaviour, delusions, 
hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, nightmares), in a very few 
cases resulting in self-injury or fatal outcomes. These events 
were reported primarily among paediatric and adolescent 
patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. 
The contribution of Oseltamivir to those events is unknown. 
Such neuropsychiatric events have also been reported in 
patients with influenza who were not taking Oseltamivir.

While no controlled clinical studies have been conducted on 
the use of oseltamivir in pregnant women, there is limited 
data available from post-marketing and retrospective 
observational surveillance reports. These data in conjunction 
with animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful 
effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal or 
postnatal development. Pregnant women may receive 
oseltamivir, after considering the available safety information, 
the pathogenicity of the circulating influenza virus strain and 
the underlying condition of the pregnant woman.

In lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are 
excreted in milk. Very limited information is available on 
children breast-fed by mothers taking oseltamivir and on 
excretion of oseltamivir in breast milk. Limited data 
demonstrated that oseltamivir and the active metabolite were 
detected in breast milk, however the levels were low, which

would result in a sub-therapeutic dose to the infant. 
Considering this information, the pathogenicity of the 
circulating influenza virus strain and the underlying condition 
of the breastfeeding woman, administration of oseltamivir 
may be considered, where there are clear potential benefits to 
breastfeeding mothers. 
Section 5.3  
In lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are 
excreted in the milk. Limited data indicate that oseltamivir 
and the active metabolite are excreted in human milk. 
Extrapolation of the animal data provides estimates of 0.01

clopidogrel) 
Probenecid 
No dose adjustment is required when co-administering with 
probenecid in patients with normal renal function. Co-
administration of probenecid, a potent inhibitor of the anionic 
pathway of renal tubular secretion, results in an approximate 
2-fold increase in exposure to the active metabolite of 
oseltamivir.  
Renal elimination 
Clinically important drug interactions involving competition 
for renal tubular secretion are unlikely, due to the known 
safety margin for most of these substances, the elimination 
characteristics of the active metabolite (glomerular filtration 
and anionic tubular secretion) and the excretion capacity of 
these pathways. However, care should be taken when 
prescribing oseltamivir in subjects when taking co-excreted 
agents with a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. 
chlorpropamide, methotrexate, phenylbutazone).

safety data are available for infants less than 1 year of age. 
Pharmacokinetic modelling was undertaken using these data 
in addition to data from studies in adults and infants and 
children 1 year of age or older. The results demonstrate that 
doses of 3 mg /kg twice daily for infants aged 3 to 12 months 
and 2.5 mg /kg twice daily for infants aged between 1 and 3 
months provide exposures similar to those shown to be 
clinically efficacious in adults and infants and children 1 year 
of age or older (see sections 4.1 and 4.2). There are currently 
no data available in infants less than 1 month of age using 
oseltamivir.

situations 
Section 4.1  
Ebilfumin is indicated for the treatment of infants less than 1 
year of age during a pandemic influenza outbreak. The 
treating physician should take into account the pathogenicity 
of the circulating strain and the underlying condition of the 
patient to ensure there is a potential benefit to the child. 
The appropriate use of Ebilfumin for prevention of influenza 
should be determined on a case by case basis by the 
circumstances and the population requiring protection. In 
exceptional situations (e.g. in case of a mismatch between 
the circulating and vaccine virus strains, and a pandemic 
situation) seasonal prevention could be considered in 
individuals one year of age or older. 
Ebilfumin is indicated for post-exposure prevention of 
influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic 
influenza outbreak. 
Section 4.2 
The recommended treatment dose for infants less than 1 year 
of age is between 2 mg/kg twice daily and 3 mg/kg twice 
daily during a pandemic influenza outbreak. This is based 
upon limited pharmacokinetic and safety data indicating that

these doses provide plasma drug exposures in the majority of 
patients similar to those shown to be clinically efficacious in 
older children and adults. Recommended age-adjusted dosing 
regimens for infants below 1 year of age are included in this 
section. 
The recommended prophylaxis dose for infants less than 1 
year of age during a pandemic influenza outbreak is half of 
the daily treatment dose. This is based upon clinical data in 
infants and children 1 year of age or older and adults showing 
that a prophylaxis dose equivalent to half the daily treatment 
dose is clinically efficacious for the prevention of influenza. 
Recommended age-adjusted dosing prophylaxis regimens for 
infants below 1 year of age are included in this section. 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indication. 
The CHMP endorsed the PRAC advice without changes. 
PSUR submission 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product 
in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) 
provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European 
medicines web-portal. 
User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed 
on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Tamiflu. The bridging report submitted by 
the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of oseltamivir 30 mg, 45 mg and 75 mg hard 
capsules. The reference product Tamiflu is indicated for treatment and prevention of influenza. 
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered 
sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active

substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from 
published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a randomized, open label, two treatment, 
four period, two sequence, single dose, crossover, fully replicate, bioequivalence study. The 
study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and 
was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall 
sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Ebilfumin met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Tamiflu. The point estimates and their 90 % confidence intervals for the 
parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance 
ranges. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Ebilfumin in the treatment and prevention of 
influenza and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

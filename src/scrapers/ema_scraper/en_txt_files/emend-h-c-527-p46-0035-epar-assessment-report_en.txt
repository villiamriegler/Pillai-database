I. 
INTRODUCTION 
On June 4, 2012, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Emend, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Emend and 
that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
II.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
II.1  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study(ies) 
Not specifically stated, but there is nothing indicating that the formulations used differed from the EU 
licensed hard capsule formulation. 
II.2  Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study ONO-7436-03: Phase III, multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study for the prevention of 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting 
The study was performed to support safety and efficacy of aprepitant in the prevention of 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in adolescent Japanese patients aged 12 to 18 
years with malignant tumour. 
The MAH notes that the study was completed on 3rd March 2011 (LPLV date), but the EMA agreed that 
the Article 46 procedure should be submitted as soon as the final translation of the clinical study report 
into English was available.  
2. Clinical study 
ONO-7436-03 Phase III, multicenter, single arm study for the prevention of chemotherapy-
induced nausea and vomiting 
  Description 
This study was conducted by Ono Pharmaceutical Co., a patent licensee of MSD for EMEND 
(aprepitant), in 8 medical institutions in Japan to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic for 
the prevention of CINV in Japanese adolescents.

  Methods 
•  Study population /Sample size 
The study involved 22 Japanese patients aged 12-18 years with malignant tumour who were scheduled 
to receive chemotherapy including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, or carboplatin.  
• 
Treatments 
The study consisted of a 3-day treatment period and a 12-day follow-up period, and the subjects were 
observed and examined until Day 15 (the 15th day after the start of study treatment).  
Aprepitant was orally administered at 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg on Days 2 and 3. On Day 1, 
aprepitant was administered 1.5 hours prior to the start of the initial highly or moderately emetogenic 
chemotherapy after breakfast. On Days 2-3, aprepitant was administered after breakfast. 
Comment: This is the dose and schedule licensed in adults. 
Dexamethasone 4 mg was administered orally days 1, 2 and 3 
Granisteron 40 mcg/kg was administered day 1. In addition if highly or moderately emetogenic therapy 
was administered on further days, granisetron was also administered on chemotherapy days.  
•  Outcomes/endpoints (selected) 
Proportions of patients with Complete Response (no vomiting, no use of rescue therapy) in the overall, 
acute and delayed phases. 
Proportions of patients with Total Control (no vomiting, no use of rescue therapy, and no nausea) in 
the overall phase. 
Proportions of patients (including those who were treated with rescue therapy) with no vomiting in the 
overall, acute and delayed phases. 
  Results 
•  Pharmacokinetic results 
PK sampling for plasma concentration-time profiles was performed on Day 1, after the 125 mg dose. 
On Days 2 and 3 only pre-dose (trough) samples were drawn. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 
aprepitant, such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC, and trough concentration (C24h, C48h, and C72h) were 
calculated by non-compartmental analysis.  
All of 22 adolescent patients (male/female ratio, 13/9; age, 12 to 18 years; body weight, 37.1 to 
72.2 kg) were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis population. The pharmacokinetic parameters 
for Japanese adolescent patients were compared with historical data for adult cancer patients (Study 
Y06BG013; n=10). Mean AUC and Cmax were similar in adolescent and adult patients, while the Cthrough 
values, especially on Days 2 and 3, appeared to be lower in adolescent patients (Table 1). The 
relationship between PK in adolescents and adults was the same also when the PK parameters were 
normalised for dose/kg bodyweight (not shown). However, there were large inter-individual differences

in the level of exposure among both adolescent and adult cancer patients, and the range of distribution 
of PK data for adolescent cancer patients was generally included in that for adult cancer patients.

Assessor’s comments:  
The approved SmPC for Emend provides the following Day 1 pharmacokinetic parameters for adult 
subjects (125 mg/80 mg 3-day regimen):  
AUC0-24hr: 19600 ± 2500 ng*hr/ml   
Cmax: 1600 ± 360 ng/ml   
There is no information in the SmPC on whether race affects aprepitant pharmacokinetics. 
No details were provided for Study YBG013 from which the adult data in the comparison were 
obtained, e.g. whether this study was also performed in Japanese patients. Between-study 
comparisons of data should be made with some caution.  
It is agreed that the new data from study ONO-7436-03 does not warrant any change in the PK section 
of the EU SmPC.

Comment: There are no good reasons to assume that aprepitant would not be efficacious in children 
12 – 18 years of age, but the empirical support based on this small single arm study is weak.  
•  Safety results 
The incidence rate of adverse events was 100.0% (22/22 subjects), and the incidence rate of adverse 
drug reactions assumed to be related to aprepitant was 4.5% (1/22). This latter refers to one case of 
mild abdominal pain.  
No clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, 12-lead ECG, or body weight were observed. 
III.  RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
In the clinical overview supporting this submission, published data are not discussed. Based on a quick 
search, however, only data of questionable informative value appear available.  
In the current SPC it is stated:  
“Paediatric population: 
The safety and efficacy of EMEND in children and adolescents below 18 years of age has not yet been 
established. No data are available.”  
This is strictly speaking no longer true, but the data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety derived 
from this small, single arm study conducted in Japanese adolescents 12 to 18 years of age are of so 
limited clinical value that it can be agreed with the MAH that a revision of the SPC is not warranted.   
  Recommendation  
x  Fulfilled

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by infection with influenza virus types A and B that 
occurs in outbreaks of varying severity almost every winter in temperate climates and year-round in 
tropical climates (Harmon et al. 2019, Tregoning et al. 2018). Influenza viruses are highly contagious 
with efficient person-person spread within communities and with the potential for pandemics with 
severe morbidity and mortality presenting significant public health challenges.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the (untreated) population  
Morbidity and Mortality: The morbidity and mortality caused by seasonal influenza outbreaks continue 
to be substantial. Worldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million 
cases of severe illness, and about 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths (WHO 2018b). The cost of 
primary care physician visits due to influenza for all EU 25 countries in 2005 was estimated at 
€267.2 million and the cost of hospital visits at €11.5 billion. An increase in the number of deaths 
caused by pneumonia and influenza is generally a late observation in an outbreak. Secondary bacterial 
pneumonia can follow acute influenza. The most common bacterial pathogens in this setting are 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenza. Mortality among 
individuals with chronic metabolic, renal, and certain immunosuppressive diseases has also been 
elevated, although lower than that among patients with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases. Pandemics 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 10/159 
 
 
  
  
provide the most dramatic evidence of the impact of influenza. However, illnesses that occur between 
pandemics account for greater total mortality and morbidity, albeit over a longer period. 
Risk factors for the disease 
Hospitalization and death occur mainly among high-risk (HR) groups. Complications of influenza occur 
most frequently in patients ≥ 65 years old and in those with certain chronic disorders, including cardiac 
or pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus, hemoglobinopathies, renal dysfunction, and 
immunosuppression. Pregnancy in the second or third trimester also predisposes the mother to 
complications with influenza. Furthermore, residents of nursing homes and other long-term facilities, 
people with weakened immune system due to disease or medications, people younger than 19 years 
old on chronic or long-term aspirin therapy, people with extreme obesity and people of American 
Indian and Alaskan Natives also are at higher risk for influenza complications. The CDC provides a 
complete list of people at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. These characteristics 
make influenza in these patients a “potentially severe disease,” which should be distinguished from the 
“common cold syndrome.” The most prominent HR conditions are chronic cardiac and pulmonary 
diseases, and age (≥ 65 years and < 2 years). Primary influenza viral pneumonia is more common in 
individuals with cardiac disease, particularly those with congenital heart disease, congestive heart 
failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, but has also been reported in OwH young adults as well as in 
older individuals with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease and asthma. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Major antigenic variations, called antigenic shifts, may be associated with pandemics and are restricted 
to influenza A virus. Minor variations are called antigenic drifts. Since 1977, H1N1 and H3N2 viruses 
have circulated simultaneously, resulting in outbreaks of varying severity. 
Influenza B viruses can co-circulate with influenza A viruses but are generally the minority type in any 
given season. Studies have suggested increased potency of influenza B virus in causing severe disease 
and mortality. Influenza B has been described to have significantly higher mortality rates compared to 
influenza A strains 
The quadrivalent vaccine includes lineages of both influenza A and B. These vaccines significantly 
decrease rates of infection; however, in susceptible populations such as children within the age group 
of 9–17 years of age it appears to have an effectiveness of approx. 28%. In contrast to influenza A and 
B viruses, influenza C virus appears to be a relatively minor cause of disease in humans. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Illness caused by influenza is characterized by an abrupt onset of high fever, chills, prostration, 
fatigue, sore throat/pharyngitis, headache, myalgia, dry cough, rhinitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and 
conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms are more common in infants and 
young children than in adults. Influenza infection severity can be defined as acute uncomplicated, 
referring to ambulant patients with a relatively benign self-limiting disease course, or “serious” or 
complicated infection requiring hospitalization. 
Influenza may be clinically diagnosed, particularly during seasonal influenza. Otherwise, molecular 
assays (including rapid molecular assays, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
and other nucleic acid amplification tests); and antigen detection tests (including rapid influenza 
diagnostic tests and immunofluorescence assays) may be used.  
Through interplay between host immune defence and influenza virulent factors, the underlying disease 
can cause a wide spectrum of complications. The most significant complication of influenza is 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 11/159 
 
 
  
  
pneumonia: "primary" influenza viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, or mixed viral and 
bacterial pneumonia. Other pulmonary complications associated with influenza include worsening of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or asthma and 
even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Sinusitis as well as otitis media (the latter occurring 
particularly often in children) may also be associated with influenza. In addition to the pulmonary 
complications of influenza, a number of extrapulmonary complications may occur. These include Reye's 
syndrome, myositis, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria. Although myalgias are very common in 
influenza, true myositis is rare. Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare. Electrocardiographic changes 
during acute influenza are common among patients with cardiac disease, but have been attributed 
most often to exacerbations of the underlying cardiac disease rather than to direct involvement of the 
myocardium with influenza virus. Central nervous system (CNS) complications, including encephalitis 
and encephalopathy, transverse myelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, have been reported during 
influenza infection with the influenza virus being considered as causal. Toxic shock syndrome 
associated with S. aureus or group A streptococcal infection following acute influenza infection has also 
been reported. In addition to complications involving the specific organ systems described above, 
influenza outbreaks include a number of cases in which elderly and other high-risk individuals develop 
influenza and subsequently experience a gradual deterioration of underlying cardiovascular, 
pulmonary, or renal function – changes that occasionally are irreversible and lead to death. These 
fatalities contribute to the overall excess mortality associated with influenza A outbreaks. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Influenza vaccination is the first line of defence against influenza. It can be administered to any person 
aged > 6 months (who does not have contraindications to vaccination) to reduce the likelihood of 
becoming ill with influenza. Trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can be used for 
any person aged > 6 months, including those with HR conditions. Live, attenuated influenza vaccine 
may be used for healthy, non-pregnant persons aged 2-49 years. Antiviral agents are required to treat 
established infection. 
Four antiviral drugs are currently approved in the EU for the prevention and treatment of influenza: the 
M2 ion-channel inhibitor amantadine and the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir, zanamivir 
and peramivir. A second M2 inhibitor, rimantadine, holds marketing authorisations in the Czech 
Republic, France and Poland but is not marketed in these countries. While there is widespread 
resistance to amantadine and rimantadine in circulating seasonal influenza, NAIs are the mainstay of 
treatment for influenza infections. Oseltamivir is indicated in children from birth for treatment and 
zanamivir is indicated from 5 years of age for treatment. Both oseltamivir and zanamivir need to be 
administered twice daily for 5 days. An inhalation formulation of zanamivir can be used in patients who 
are able to inhale the drug (excluding children aged < 5 years). 
Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatments are available but are not a substitute for influenza 
vaccination. Oseltamivir is indicated for individuals ≥1 year of age following contact with a clinically 
diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community. Oseltamivir is 
administered once daily for 10 days following close contact with an infected individual. Oseltamivir is 
indicated for PEP of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic influenza outbreak. 
In addition, zanamivir is indicated for PEP from 5 years of age and is administered once daily for 10 
days. 
About the product 
Baloxavir marboxil is a novel prodrug which is converted pre-systemically to the active form baloxavir 
through metabolism (hydrolysis). The active form selectively inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease, 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 12/159 
 
 
  
  
an influenza virus-specific enzyme in the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase 
complex, which thereby inhibits influenza virus replication. 
For both indications (treatment and prophylaxis of influenza), the use of Xofluza is a single oral dose 
administration.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was due to the fact that while it was agreed 
that there is a public interest in getting more and better treatment options for influenza, the presented 
results on clinical parameters were not convincingly better than available treatment options. Further, 
the potential benefit in case of resistance to available treatment options remains a theoretical benefit, 
as currently rates of oseltamivir resistance remain low. Thus, there were no solid grounds for 
concluding that baloxavir is of major public interest or that baloxavir constitutes a major therapeutic 
innovation. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as immediate-release film-coated tablets for oral administration 
containing 20 mg or 40 mg of baloxavir marboxil as the active substance. 
Other ingredients in the tablet core are: lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium (E468), 
povidone (K25), microcrystalline cellulose (E460) and sodium stearyl fumarate.  
Other ingredients in the film coating are: hypromellose, talc (E553b) and titanium dioxide (E171). 
The film-coated tablets are available in oriented polyamide (OPA)/aluminium foil/polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) laminate blisters with a PVC based heat seal coated aluminium. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of baloxavir marboxil is ({(12aR)-12-[(11S)-7,8-difluoro-6,11- 
dihydrodibenzo[b,e] thiepin-11-yl]-6,8-dioxo- 3,4,6,8,12,12a-hexahydro-1H-[1,4]oxazino[3,4-
c]pyrido[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl}oxy)methyl methyl carbonate. It corresponds to the molecular 
formula C27H23F2N3O7S, its relative molecular mass is 571.55 g/mol and it has the chemical structure 
shown in Figure 1.  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 13/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Figure 1. Structure of baloxavir marboxil. 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 
mass spectrometry (MS), IR spectroscopy, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectrometry, UV spectrometry, and 
by single crystal x-ray crystallography. 
Baloxavir marboxil appears as a white to light yellow, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is 
practically insoluble in water, and aqueous buffer solutions with pH 1 - pH 9 (4.4-6.1 μg/mL); in pH 11 
buffer, solubility is 24.8 μg/mL but this value represents the solubility of baloxavir which is formed at 
this pH by conversion of the AS. It is sparingly soluble in acetone, slightly soluble in methanol, and 
ethanol (99.5 %), very slightly soluble 2-propanol, and 1-octanol. No acid dissociation constant pKa 
can be determined; its partition coefficient was found 5.80. 
Baloxavir marboxil molecule has 2 asymmetric carbon atoms and exhibits stereoisomerism. In addition 
to the desired (R,S) configuration, the enantiomer (S,R) and 2 diastereomers (R,R and S,S) exist. The 
enantiomer and the two diastereomers can be differentiated from the active substance (AS) and are 
controlled in the AS specification. 
Polymorphism has been observed for baloxavir marboxil. It is produced as Form I, which was found to 
be the most stable form. The manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing Form I.  All 
forms can be distinguished by x-ray diffraction. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance manufacturer has been stated.  
The manufacturing process consists of ten steps and was adequately described. The starting materials 
have been selected in line with the considerations of ICH Q11 and are considered acceptable. Adequate 
details have been provided of suppliers, manufacturing flow charts, specifications and batch data. The 
isolated intermediates were defined and are controlled by acceptable specifications. Reagents, 
solvents, catalysts and auxiliary materials used in the synthesis are also controlled by acceptable 
specifications. 
All the synthetic steps and the milling step are considered critical steps and are controlled by 
appropriate in-process controls. A major objection had been raised on the manner in which the proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) were presented because it was unclear whether the PARs were intended to 
be used in a multivariate or univariate way. It was clarified that the process is run in a univariate way 
and the described proven acceptable ranges (PARs) are not used in a multivariate way. No design 
space is claimed. The PARs are considered fully justified as they have been derived through a rigorous 
and stepwise risk assessment during development. Extensive discussion has been provided to justify 
the PARs and also the impurity control strategy (genotoxic and otherwise) and how the process is 
capable of purging them. Genotoxic substances involved in the synthesis are appropriately controlled. 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 14/159 
 
 
  
  
 
No holding times are proposed. The manufacturing process is run at set points/target values and within 
normal operating ranges (NORs). The PAR ranges are now listed unambiguously, and the ranges 
provided are consistent with the PARs determined during process development. The control of the 
process is now acceptable and the tight control of process parameters, with other complementary parts 
of the control strategy, provides assurance for the consistent manufacture of future batches. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
An elaborated impurity discussion and control strategy has been presented covering starting materials, 
reagents and solvents used in the synthesis, as well as elemental impurities, carry over of 
intermediates and synthetic by-products. The mutagenic impurity evaluation thus included 150 
substances. The control strategy is based on knowledge of the synthesis, purging factors (originating 
from purging studies or theoretical estimations), and batch data of starting materials, intermediates 
and active substance. Mutagenic impurities are controlled by appropriate specifications on the relevant 
materials or by controls applied during the manufacturing process. Overall, the control strategy for 
impurities has been presented in detail and is considered satisfactory. 
The stereochemistry of the active substance is ensured by the process and is also sufficiently 
controlled.  
The AS was designed to be readily hydrolysed upon administration to the active form, and for this 
purpose the methoxycarbonyloxymethyl group has been chosen as a side chain.  
A history of the synthetic route evolution was provided. Different versions of the process have been 
clearly designated and a summary of the changes has been presented, which involve changes in sites, 
scale, and some changes in process parameters. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags tightly closed with 
plastic ties placed into a secondary container, e.g. metal or fibre. A satisfactory specification for the 
LDPE bag is provided. The LDPE complies with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 and 
Regulation (EU) No. 2017/752 and with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 “Polyolefins”.  
Specification 
The AS specification includes appropriate tests and limits for description (visual), identification (UV, 
IR), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), stereoisomer content (chiral HPLC), residual solvents 
(GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
The specifications are in line with ICH Q6A and are acceptable.  The unwanted enantiomer and 
diastereomers are controlled as impurities to the ICH Q3A qualification threshold. The limits for related 
substances are set based on toxicological studies and batch data. An acceptable toxicological 
justification has been provided for those impurity limits above the ICH Q3A qualification threshold. The 
control strategy for genotoxic impurities, residual solvents and polymorphism is satisfactory. The assay 
limit is also acceptable. 
The specification limit for particle size is defined based on batch data (including clinical) and the limit 
has been set in relation to finished product critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
During stability studies, microbial contamination and the water activity was monitored. No changes 
were observed and with a water activity on 0.6, there is no microbiological risk for the active substance 
and thus a microbial limit test was not deemed necessary.  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 15/159 
 
 
  
  
In line with ICH Q3D, batches of active substance have been tested for elemental impurities by a 
properly validated ICP-MS method. The risk of elemental impurities contamination exceeding the PDE 
value was reduced by introducing appropriate controls in relevant intermediates and by employing 
suitable purification means and processes. Therefore, a control in the active substance specification is 
not deemed necessary. 
Batch data were provided for 5 commercial scale batches manufactured with the proposed synthetic 
route. The results comply with the proposed specification and demonstrate consistent manufacture and 
quality of the AS. Data from another 9 batches, ranging in batch size from pilot to commercial scale, 
including the non-clinical and clinical batches and covering the different manufacturing processes used 
throughout the development were presented. Differences in impurity limits and methods for earlier 
batches have been adequately explained and there are no concerns. The data support the process 
being under control and the comparable quality between batch sizes and different versions of the 
manufacturing process.  
Stability 
Stability data has been provided for three pilot scale batches manufactured with the previous process 
at the proposed site. This manufacturing process is fully representative of and simulating the 
manufacturing process to be applied to a full production scale batch. These primary stability batches 
were packaged in the proposed container closure system. Stability data were provided for up to 24 
months stored at long term conditions (30°C / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months at accelerated 
conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines.  
Samples were tested for description, identification, assay, related substances, water content, 
crystalline form, particle size, and microbial limit. Related substances increased at accelerated 
condition but remained well within the proposed acceptance criteria. Regardless of the storage 
condition, all results comply with the specification limits; no trends were observed.   
Additionally, stability data were generated for the three first commercial scale batches, per the current 
process at the proposed manufacturing site, and stored for up to 12 months under long term and for 6 
months under accelerated conditions. Batches were packaged in the proposed container closure system 
and were stored protected from light. Samples were tested for description, identification, related 
substances, stereoisomers, water, assay, crystalline form, particle size, water activity and microbial 
limit. Related substances increased under accelerated conditions but remained well within the proposed 
acceptance criteria. Regardless of the storage condition, all results comply with the specification limits; 
no trends were observed.    
Data from one additional technical batch, manufactured by the current process at the proposed 
manufacturing site and stored under accelerated conditions for 6 months, were provided as supportive 
information. The related substances increased but remained well within the proposed acceptance 
criteria. 
Stress testing was carried out on a pilot scale batch. The conditions investigated were: 
•  60°C/ Ambient RH, protected from light in an amber glass bottle for three months.  
•  25°C/ 85% RH, protected from light in an open petri dish for three months.  
•  40°C/ 75% RH, protected from light in an open petri dish for three months.  
The parameters tested were the same as for the formal stability studies. No significant changes were 
noted except a minor increase in one impurity. Regardless of the stress condition, no additional trends 
were observed. 
Photostability testing was carried out on one pilot batch in as per ICH Q1B. There were no significant 
changes in any tested parameter, except that the appearance changed from white powder to pale 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 16/159 
 
 
  
  
yellow powder. The AS is not considered photosensitive but because of the colour change it is, 
accepted to include the warning “protect from light”. 
Forced degradation testing was carried out on a pilot scale batch under the following conditions in solid 
state: 80°C/ ambient, protected from light; 60°C / 75% RH, protected from light; 25°C / 60% RH, D65 
lamp (4000 lx). Parameters tested were description, assay, related substances, stereoisomers, and 
water. Except for the appearance change from white powder to pale yellow powder due to light 
exposure, no significant change was observed.  
Forced degradation testing in solution state in a range of solubilising solutions and pHs, temperatures 
and storage period was also performed. Parameters tested were clarity and colour of solution, assay, 
related substances, and stereoisomers.  Certain impurities increased under different storage 
conditions. Based on the results of the forced degradation studies, the analytical methods for assay 
and related substances are stability indicating. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed retest period of 24 months for the AS when stored 
below 30°C protected from light, is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release film-coated tablet for oral administration, presented in 
two strengths, containing 20 mg or 40 mg of baloxavir marboxil.  
The 20 mg tablets are oblong, white to light yellow film-coated tablets debossed on one side with the 
manufacturer’s trademark and the identifier code “772”, and on the other side with “20”.  
The 40 mg tablets are oblong, white to light yellow film-coated tablets debossed on one side with 
“BXM” and on the other side with “40”. 
The qualitative and quantitative composition of Xofluza film-coated tablets has been stated; the list of 
excipients is presented in section 2.2.1 of this report and in SmPC 6.1. 
Formulation development 
The AS is a prodrug which is metabolised into the active form after administration. The key AS 
physical/chemical properties which could impact are in accordance with ICH Q6A guideline. It was 
demonstrated that the proposed specification ensures satisfactory finished product dissolution, 
stability, blend uniformity, appearance and processability. 
The chosen excipients are commonly used in immediate release film-coated tablets and are described 
in Ph. Eur., except the film coating mixture, which consists of pharmacopoeial ingredients.  The choice 
and function of each excipient has been presented. Compatibility with the AS has been investigated 
and drove the selection of excipients and coating. The quantity of each excipient has been discussed 
with reference to some tablet CQAs such as dissolution, hardness and appearance. 
The choice of pharmaceutical form/strength adequately addresses the proposed dosing regime, i.e. one 
single dose of 40 mg or 80 mg. A paediatric formulation has been developed and paediatric studies are 
ongoing. The paediatric formulation is not part of the present application. The history of formulations 
used for clinical studies and the compositions of the various formulations used during development 
were presented. The Phase 3 clinical studies utilised a 20 mg tablet formulation and the doses being 
studied are 40 mg and 80 mg. A 10 mg tablet has also been used for clinical studies. The particle size 
of AS was classified as a critical material attribute (CMA) and is controlled in the active substance 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 17/159 
 
 
  
  
specification in line with clinical batches. The impact of AS particle size on finished product quality in 
terms of dissolution, stability, blend uniformity, appearance, and processability was investigated. 
The applicant has clearly laid out the different formulations used for each clinical study (20 mg 
strength). Only small changes have been made since Phase 2 and the rationale for each is provided. 
Comparative dissolution studies demonstrated no significant difference. The proposed commercial 
formulation of the 20 mg tablet has been used for phase 3 clinical trials. The 40 mg strength was 
subsequently developed. Linear pharmacokinetics are claimed. In support of waiver of clinical/ 
bioequivalence studies for the 40 mg strength, comparative dissolution profiles between the 20 mg 
clinical batches and the 40 mg strength have been presented. The dissolution studies were carried out 
in media with three different pHs (pH 1.0, 4.5 and 6.8) with and without surfactant and demonstrated 
over 85% dissolution at 15 min and/or f2 values over 50 for each pH. The strength biowaiver is 
therefore acceptable. 
The AS is a prodrug and is mainly hydrolysed to the active form in the small intestine. Therefore, the 
most appropriate pH of dissolution media to ensure complete and rapid dissolution of the product is 
that of intestinal fluid, rather than that of gastric fluid. The dissolution medium was selected based on 
the solubility of the AS and dissolution profiles of the 20 mg and 40 mg tablets.  The discriminatory 
power of the method was sufficiently demonstrated by showing differentiation of tablets with 
meaningful variations in AS attributes, or other relevant changes in composition and/ or manufacturing 
process 
Overall, the development of the dissolution method proposed for QC testing is acceptable and the 
discriminatory properties are demonstrated. 
Manufacturing process development 
The Quality by Design (QbD) principles outlined in ICH guidelines (Q8, Q9 and Q10) have been 
adopted in developing the manufacturing process. The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and 
critical quality attributes (CQA) were established and presented. CQAs were identified based on their 
impacts on patient safety, efficacy and usability. Preliminary studies identified high risk potential 
critical process parameters (CPPs) based on process experience (i.e. potential impact on CQAs and 
further investigation needed). Control ranges for CPPs and CMAs were established based on 
experiments intended to provide a better understanding of the manufacturing process and develop a 
suitable control strategy. 
A bulk hold study was carried out on two commercial-scale batches of each strength. The amount of 
degradant increased slightly but no other changes were noted, thus supporting the proposed bulk hold 
time. 
Container closure system 
Xofluza film-coated tablets are packaged in cold formed oriented polyamide (OPA) / aluminium foil / 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) laminate blisters with a PVC based heat seal coated aluminium. Blisters will be 
placed in a secondary container (fibre carton folding box). Details are provided for each component 
and satisfactory specifications were provided. The product-contact side of the blister foil and lidding foil 
comply with Regulation (EU) No.10/2011 subsequent revisions. The proposed packaging is considered 
suitable for packaging of the finished product based on the stability studies. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
 The finished product manufacturer has been stated. The manufacturing process is a standard wet 
granulation process and consists of blending, granulation, drying, sizing, blending, lubrication, 
compression, coating and packaging. The same blend is used to produce both strengths. The level of 
details in the description of the manufacturing process is acceptable. 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 18/159 
 
 
  
  
Critical steps were identified and clearly presented. Appropriate in-process controls have been 
established based on the manufacturing process development studies. As discussed above, the defined 
PARs are not operated in a multivariate way; no design space is claimed. The proposed bulk hold time 
is justified as discussed above. 
The manufacturing process is a standard process. Nevertheless, full process validation data were 
provided for three batches of each strength. The data indicate that the process is capable of 
manufacturing product of consistent quality. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification (UHPLC, UV), assay (UHPLC), related substances (HPLC), uniformity 
of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur., UV), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limit tests 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The parameters included in the finished product specification are acceptable. An acceptable justification 
for parameters omitted from the specification was provided. The justification for the impurity limits can 
be followed and takes ICH Q3B into account. Toxicological justification has been provided for impurity 
levels above the ICH Q3B qualification threshold. The dissolution limit is justified based the dissolution 
profile of several batches including the biobatch and stability data for the 40 mg biowaiver batch. It 
has been demonstrated that the polymorphic form does not change during manufacture or storage of 
the finished product. It has been satisfactorily justified that there is no need to test residual solvent in 
the finished product specification. Based on batch data it was concluded that the risk of the AS 
converting to stereoisomers in the product is low and thus control of stereoisomers is not necessary. 
A risk assessment for elemental impurities has been conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D, to 
evaluate the potential for elemental impurities to be present in the finished product and the relevant 
discussion has been provided. In ten batches tested, no elemental impurities were identified to be 
present at a level of greater than 30% of the PDE limit for oral administration. Based on this, tests for 
elemental impurities are not included in the finished product specification.  
A risk assessment, in line with the “Questions and answers on Information on nitrosamines for 
marketing authorisation holders” and the “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation 
holders” published on the EMA website, has been presented for both the finished product 
manufacturing process and the active substance with respect to potential formation of nitrosamine 
impurities. The outcome of the risk assessment confirms that there is no risk for nitrosamine impurities 
formation and no risk for cross-contamination with other products. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with ICH Q2 
guideline. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are presented for three full scale primary stability batches and three full scale 
process validation batches of each strength, manufactured at the proposed commercial scale at the 
proposed manufacturing site. In addition, batch analysis data from some smaller clinical batches was 
presented. All results complied with the specifications in place at the time (old methods provided) and 
the data are consistent. The results showed that the finished product meets the proposed specifications 
and confirm the batch-to-batch consistency.  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 19/159 
 
 
  
  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three full scale primary stability batches of each strength, manufactured and 
packed at the proposed manufacturing site, and stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions 
(25ºC / 60% RH and 30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stability data were also presented from three batches of each strength intended for commercial use 
manufactured and packed at the proposed manufacturing site and stored for up to 6 months under 
long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH and 30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines.  
Stability samples were tested for description, identification, related substances, stereoisomers, 
uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, assay, water, hardness and microbial limits. The methods were 
the same as for release. Some minor differences are the result of slight optimisations to the methods 
for dissolution and impurities introduced after start of the stability studies. These changes were 
discussed and are not expected to impact the results. Stereoisomer and hardness tests were also 
performed for some stability studies using validated methods.  
 A known degradation product increased slightly under both long term and accelerated conditions; no 
changes were observed for other related substances. No changes were observed for other tested 
parameters either. The same findings were observed in the commercial batches as for the primary 
stability study batches. A tendency for an increase in one of the degradation products was observed. 
All other parameters remained unchanged.  
A photostability study in accordance with the ICH Q1B guideline was carried out on one batch of each 
strength.  Based on the results the tablets are not considered to be sensitive to light. 
Temperature cycling testing was conducted on one batch of each strength. The results demonstrate 
that the product is not affected by temperature cycling and support limited duration excursions from 
recommended storage conditions during product handling and distribution. 
Stress testing was carried out on one batch of each strength for three months.  A known degradation 
product-increased to a variable degree under the different test conditions. Under increased humidity, 
there was a tendency for a decrease in hardness and increase in water. No other changes were noted. 
Forced degradation testing was carried out on both strengths to elucidate the degradation pathways 
and to support suitability of the stability-indicating power of the analytical methods. Both solid and 
solution phase degradation were investigated. Samples in the solid state were exposed to heat, heat 
and humidity, and light (in line with ICH photostability conditions). Samples in solution were exposed 
to water/acetonitrile, acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, and oxidation and have been compared to 
unstressed samples. Proposed degradation pathways were presented. The methods for testing assay 
and related substances of baloxavir marboxil are considered stability indicating. 
Based on the submitted stability data the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with the storage condition 
“store in the original package in order to protect from moisture” is justified. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products.

No other materials derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The overall control strategy is adequately justified and is 
acceptable.  The proposed strength biowaiver for the 40 mg strength has been sufficiently supported. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GLP: 
For the nonclinical part of the dossier, the safety pharmacology studies, the study of tissue distribution 
in pregnant rats, and the pivotal toxicity studies were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) guidelines. 
All studies were conducted under an extensive GLP audit program and in general appear to be GLP 
compliant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted to the active form baloxavir through metabolism. The 
active form selectively inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN), an influenza virus-specific 
enzyme in the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase complex, which thereby 
inhibits influenza virus replication. Baloxavir marboxil, a prodrug form of baloxavir, did not have an 
inhibitory potency like baloxavir. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro pharmacology 
Baloxavir has a more potent virus replication inhibitory effect than the control drugs in the laboratory 
strains of influenza A and B viruses determined both as decrease in virus titer and number of plaques 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 21/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
in infected MDCK cells. EC50 was typically subnanomolar against influenza type A and approximately 
2-7 nM against influenza virus type B. It appears that baloxavir is up to 50-200 times more potent 
than oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in these assays (study 1088864 and 1088871). 
A similar picture was found when testing in clinical isolates from across the world, i.e. EC50 for 
baloxavir of 0.34 to 2.12 nmol/L for type A viruses, with the exception of the polymorphic variant 
A/Louisiana/49/2017-PA/I38M [H3N2], and 5.54 to 14.23 nmol/L for type B viruses (study 1088869, 
1088915 and 1091646).  
Furthermore, baloxavir decreased number of plaques of vaccine strains of influenza type A and B 
recommended by WHO. In addition, baloxavir showed similar potency against NA inhibitor-resistant 
viruses and its wild-type viruses of both A and B types (study 1088875). 
Baloxavir is more potent against influenza type A compared to type B. This was explained by 
differences in molecular interactions in the hydrophobic pocket in which baloxavir is situated in the 
virus Polymerase Acidic Protein. 
The combination-use of baloxavir and a NA inhibitor inhibited virus replication in MDCK cells 
synergistically (study 1088919 and 1094824) for both influenza A and B strains. 
Overall, in vitro proof of concept is considered established for baloxavir. 
In the baloxavir-resistant virus isolation assay, all influenza viruses with a reduced susceptibility were 
containing an isoleucine-to-threonine substitution at amino acid position 38 in PA (PA/I38T). The 
PA/I38T mutation resulted in a reduced virus replication capacity, compared with the wild-type virus. 
Hence, influenza A virus harbouring PA/I38T is considered unlikely to emerge in clinical settings. The 
same exercise was conducted with influenza virus type B. However, no mutations were identified which 
resulted in reduced susceptibility to baloxavir. 
MDCK cells were infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/H5N1 isolated from patients in 
Hong Kong. Baloxavir showed a 10 times better potency than oseltamivir in inhibiting the replication of 
this avian influenza virus and has an inhibitory activity against the NA inhibitor-resistant highly 
pathogenic avian influenza virus comparable to that against the wild-type virus.  
A similar picture was obtained when testing baloxavir against avian influenza virus A/H7N9. Baloxavir 
was also shown to be efficient against various influenza A virus isolated from pigs, chickens and ducks 
(H1N2, H5N2, H5N6, and H9N2, study 1088904). 
In vivo pharmacology 
In vivo studies were carried out in mouse non-lethal models of seasonal influenza infections to show 
the antiviral efficacy of baloxavir marboxil using virus titer in lungs as end-point. 
Baloxavir marboxil was orally administered twice daily (BID) for 1 day to mice inoculated with an 
influenza A or B virus 5 days post-inoculation, and the virus titer in the lung was measured 24 hours 
after the first dose.  
Baloxavir marboxil was compared to other established antiviral drugs at clinically equivalent doses. In 
all cases baloxavir marboxil was the most efficacious and most potent against influenza A virus 
compared to oseltamivir, favipiravir, zanamivir (nasal administration) and laninamivir. Baloxavir 
marboxil was also efficacious against influenza B virus, although less potently. As also shown in in vitro 
studies, baloxavir marboxil is efficacious against neuramidine inhibitor resistant influenza A virus with 
similar potency as for wild type influenza A virus. 
The effect of baloxavir marboxil was dose dependent in a wide dose range of 0.5 to 50 mg/kg BID. 
This mouse model was supported with pharmacokinetic analysis of baloxavir marboxil at all doses 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 22/159 
 
 
  
  
showing dose-linear AUCinf, except at the highest dose, which showed less than dose linear AUC. At the 
highest dose of 50 mg/kg, absorption process(es) appeared to have reached saturation, since tmax was 
delayed from 0.5 hours to 2 hours between 15 and 50 mg/kg dose (study 1088858). 
A time-course analysis of inhibitory effect of baloxavir marboxil on viral replication indicated that the 
treatments of 0.5 or 5 mg/kg of baloxavir marboxil 5 days post infection for 1 or 3 days reduced the 
virus titres of a non-lethal dose of strain A/Osaka/129/2009 during the period of viral shedding. The 
effect was superior to that of the treatment of 5 mg/kg of oseltamivir phosphate for 3 days in mice 
(study 1088861). 
Baloxavir appeared to have beneficial effects on survival after viral infection both in combination with 
oseltamivir and after delayed treatment. It should be noted that oseltamivir showed surprisingly little 
effects in the mouse models of viral infection, whereas baloxavir marboxil showed consistent efficacy 
with virus titers significantly (P<0.0001) lower than in the control groups at the 5 mg/kg BID dose, 
although the higher dose levels of 15 and 50 mg/kg provided even lower virus titers than 5 mg/kg 
(study 1094926). 
Furthermore, it was shown that the prophylactic effect of a single subcutaneous administration of 
baloxavir against a lethal infection of influenza virus A or mouse adapted B was optimal at 48 hours 
(study 1094814). The effect declined thereafter, which seems logical considering the half-life is 2-3 
hours of baloxavir in the mouse. It is unclear why subcutaneous administration of baloxavir was used 
in this study instead of baloxavir marboxil by the oral route. It should be mentioned that this study 
was supported by exposure determination, however only from to 48 to 192 hours post dosing, i.e. long 
after tmax. 
PK/PD analyses were performed based on the inhibitory effect on virus replication in the lung and 
plasma concentrations of baloxavir in the mouse infection model. The plasma concentration at the end 
of dosing interval after the first dose (Cτ) was shown to be the PK parameter best correlated with the 
virus titer in the lung 24 hours after the first dose. The Cτ of baloxavir that met the above efficacy 
target was 6.85 ng/mL from the nonclinical investigation (study 1088859). PK/PD relationship is 
considered established.  
Finally, it was shown in vitro (MDCK cells) that human serum at 12.5 or 25% did not shift EC90 of 
baloxavir to a significant degree (study 1088859). A small shift in EC90 was observed from 7 nM at 
25% to 11 nM at 50%. Protein binding was not determined in the mouse. Overall, to make up for the 
uncertainty of the significance of protein binding, protein binding could be considered not to reduce the 
efficacy of baloxavir marboxil to a degree of more than 3 times. Hence, a plasma concentration of 
baloxavir at CT is above approximately 20 ng/mL (3 times 6.85 ng/mL) should be adequate for 
clinically relevant effect. For comparison; the data, submitted in Clinical study report 1510T0811 state 
that AUC0-72h after a 40 mg dose = 3475 ng/mL*hr. This corresponds to a mean plasma concentration 
of 48 ng/mL across the first 72 hours and C24h is 57.6 ng/mL. 
Baloxavir marboxil demonstrated pharmacological effect in mouse non-lethal models. Applicant also 
investigated the effect of baloxavir marboxil in lethal mouse models in comparison with oseltamivir. In 
one study, baloxavir marboxil (BID for 1 day) or oseltamivir phosphate (BID for 5 days) was orally 
administered to mice inoculated with influenza A/H1N1 or B virus immediately after inoculation to 
determine the survival rate of mice for 14- or 21-days post-inoculation. Baloxavir marboxil provided 
complete survival in mice infected with the A virus at the dose 0.5 mg/ BID for one day. Oseltamivir 
did not show complete survival at 5 mg/kg BID for 5 days. A dose of 5 mg/kg baloxavir marboxil was 
necessary against the B virus, however the potency against B virus was still better than for oseltamivir 
(studies 1088916 and 1088872). 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020

A more clinically relevant model was the delayed treatment model in which mice were inoculated with 
a lethal dose of virus (A/PR/8/34) and treated with baloxavir marboxil or oseltamivir at 24, 48, 72 or 
96 hours after. See Figure 2 Here it was demonstrated that treatment initiation 72 hours after 
inoculation, the dose of 1.5 mg/kg baloxavir marboxil BID for 5 days, provided full survival, whereas 
oseltamivir at 5 mg/kg BID showed 90% mortality at that time of treatment initiation (study 
1088911). It should be noted that at 96 hours, survival was 50% for 1.5 mg/kg and 70% for 15 mg/kg 
of baloxavir marboxil, hence timing of initiation of treatment seems to be crucial for clinically relevant 
effect. The posology of baloxavir marboxil in patients is a single dose of 40 mg (minimum 0.5 mg/kg 
corresponding to a mouse equivalent single dose of 6.25 mg/kg), which should be taken within 48 
hours of symptom onset. The time for maximal plasma concentration is 4 hours and half-life of 
baloxavir marboxil is 79 hours in humans (SmPC). From a nonclinical point of view, the posology in 
patients seems plausible.

Since timing of treatment appear to be crucial and that treatment with high doses of baloxavir 
marboxil 96 hours after inoculation could not provide full survival in the mouse lethal model, a study of 
the combination treatment of baloxavir marboxil and oseltamivir was conducted (study 1088914). 
Baloxavir marboxil and oseltamivir phosphate was orally administered BID for 5 days to mice 
inoculated with a lethal dose of influenza A/H1N1 virus 96 hours post-inoculation. Doses of 1.5 mg/kg 
of baloxavir marboxil and 10 or 50 mg/kg oseltamivir BID for 5 days provided full survival even 96 
days after inoculation.

Baloxavir marboxil showed relevant clinical effect in a ferret model of non-lethal influenza A infection. 
Baloxavir marboxil administered at 10 or 30 mg/kg BID for one day provided reduction in virus titers in 
nasal washes and reduction in temperature change in the days following the infection. This study was 
also supported with pharmacokinetic data, however showed that AUC increased more than dose-
proportionally between 10 and 30 mg/kg with AUCinf of 460 and 3300 ng/mL*h, respectively. This is an 
increase in exposure of 7 with an increase in dose of 3.33. HED of 10 and 30 mg/kg in the ferret is 1.9 
and 5.7 mg/kg, somewhat higher than the clinical maximum dose of approximately 1 mg/kg in 
patients (80 mg to e.g. 81 kg body weight or 40 mg to e.g. 39 kg body weight). It should be noted 
that doses higher than 80 mg have not been intentionally administered to humans and there is 
apparently linear kinetics between 6 and 80 mg, hence the clinical relevance of the nonlinear 
pharmacokinetics in the ferret may not be known. 
Baloxavir marboxil showed dose-dependent decrease in virus titers in nasal washes of 
immunocompromised mice inoculated 5 days earlier with a non-lethal dose of the influenza A/PR/8/34 
strain. The dose 1.5 mg/kg BID for 5 days was more effective than 50 mg/kg BID for 5 days of 
oseltamivir. 
In a mouse lethal model inoculated with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (A/H5N1, Hong 
Kong/483/97 strain), baloxavir marboxil (BID for 1 or 5 days) or oseltamivir phosphate (BID for 5 
days) was orally administered to mice immediately after inoculation. Baloxavir marboxil provided 
complete survival when dosed at 5 or 50 mg/kg BID for both 1 day or 5 days. Oseltamivir provided 
70% survival after 14 days when dosed 50 mg/kg BID for 5 days (study 1088870). When treatment is 
initiated right after inoculation with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, baloxavir marboxil 
appear efficient although a higher dose was necessary than for e.g. influenza virus A/H1N1 (0.5 
mg/kg, 1088916). No virus with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir emerged during treatment with 
baloxavir marboxil (study 1088910). 
A similar study was conducted with avian influenza virus A/H7N9 in which the mice again were treated 
with baloxavir marboxil or oseltamivir right after inoculation and throughout 28 days (study 1088905). 
In this study dosing of baloxavir marboxil 5 mg/kg BID for one day and 0.5 mg/kg BID for 5 days and 
above provided full survival after 28 days. 
Baloxavir marboxil showed effect against two strains of avian influenza virus, however only in a model 
of treatment immediately after inoculation. On the other hand, since baloxavir have shown effect after 
delayed treatment with other influenza A viruses (up to and including 72 hours post infection with 
baloxavir marboxil alone and up to 96 hours in combination with oseltamivir), it is considered plausible 
that a similar picture will appear for avian influenza strains, although perhaps requiring higher doses. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Applicant investigated cellular toxicity of baloxavir in vitro. This was carried out in cell-lines used for 
potency testing (study 1088988). Finally, a selectivity index was calculated and compared with 
ribavirin and favipiravir (study 1088990). It would have been more informative if the same exercise 
was performed with oseltamivir, which should be considered the most relevant comparator. 
Nevertheless, baloxavir appear to provide a large selectivity index with low cytotoxic potential. 
Applicant also tested the cytotoxic potential in cell-lines of human origin both in the proliferation phase 
and in the non-proliferating phase (study 1088991). It is agreed that baloxavir show low potential for 
cytotoxicity in human tissue. 
Both baloxavir and baloxavir marboxil was evaluated for potential for mitochondrial toxicity in an assay 
in which HepG2 cells were made more susceptible by incubation with galactose instead of glucose. The 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 25/159 
 
 
  
  
study was supported with a range of positive controls. Neither baloxavir nor baloxavir marboxil showed 
any sign of mitochondrial toxicity. 
Applicant provided a receptor screening study. In this study, the inhibition of 66 receptors, ion 
channels, transporters, or enzymes by baloxavir was investigated. Baloxavir 10 µmol/L (4.83 µg/mL) 
did not inhibit the binding to any of them by more than 50%. The highest inhibition was observed for 
two Type L Ca channels (43 and 38% inhibition), GABA A chloride channel (36%) and opiate κ (39%). 
Since, baloxavir at the maximum dose show Cmax of 253 ng/mL in humans corresponding to ~0.5 µM 
(Report 1510t0811, page 69), it is agreed that baloxavir is unlikely to cause adverse reactions 
mediated by these receptors, ion channels, transporters or enzymes (study 1088984). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
CNS 
The effects of baloxavir marboxil on the central nervous system were evaluated in male Crl:CD(SD) 
rats aged 8 weeks by examining general behaviour and neurobehavioral function using a modified 
functional observational battery method (FOB) (study 1088993).  
Baloxavir marboxil was suspended in 0.5 w/v% methylcellulose solution (vehicle) and was 
administered once orally to rats (6/group) at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), 200, 600, and 2000 mg/kg. 
Whereas it is agreed that no difference between vehicle and active dose groups were observed for 
FOB, effects were observed on rectal temperature and urine volume. It is however agreed that the 
changes in both rectal temperature and urine volume may be of limited clinical relevance. 
Cardiovascular effects 
Baloxavir had no effect on action potential at 0.1, 0.3, or 1 μmol/L in male guinea pig papillary muscles 
(actual concentrations in organ bath: 0.82, 0.25 and 0.83 µmol/L). The highest dose of baloxavir 
tested was 400 ng/mL. Since median Cmax at the highest dose is 253 ng/mL (~ 0.5 µM), the highest 
concentrations used in the guinea pig papillar muscle study is providing a safety margin - however 
limited.  
Baloxavir were evaluated on the potassium currents, which are human ether-a-go-go-related gene 
(hERG) currents, in hERG transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using the patch clamp 
method (1088998). IC50 was 7.31 µg/mL for baloxavir and is considered not to be clinically relevant.  
The effects of baloxavir marboxil (oral administration of single dose of 200 or 400 mg/kg) on the 
cardiovascular system was evaluated in 4 conscious male cynomolgus monkeys, using a telemetry 
system (study 1088994). Applicant (study director) concluded that there were no test substance-
related changes in any cardiovascular parameter at 200 or 400 mg/kg. This is agreed even though 
subtle effects were observed as described below*.  
*: Statistically significant increases were observed in systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure at 4 
hours after dosing at 400 mg/kg when compared with the control substance dosing; however, these 
were not considered test substance related because the individual animal values were similar to the 
pre-dose values and differences from the time matched control value were 10 mmHg or below. 
Furthermore, heart rate was increased in 2 animals (Nos. 2 and 4) at 4 hours after dosing at 400 
mg/kg when compared with the pre-dose values; however, this increase was not considered test 
substance related because the values were almost within the range of variation at control substance 
dosing. 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 26/159 
 
 
  
  
These findings could be related to the clinical signs of vomiting, retching (animal 4) and diarrhoea 
(animal 2 and 3), which were observed with higher prevalence in the highest dose compared to the low 
dose and control dosing events. 
The study was supported with toxicokinetics. Maximal plasma concentration of baloxavir in the 
monkeys in this study were well above Cmax at the highest dose in humans (median 253 ng/mL), i.e. 
the doses used are considered to provide an appropriate safety margin.  
Respiratory effects 
The effects of baloxavir marboxil on the respiratory system were evaluated in male Crl:CD(SD) rats 
aged 8 weeks by measuring respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute volume using whole body 
plethysmography. Baloxavir marboxil suspended in 0.5 w/v% methylcellulose solution (vehicle) was 
administered as a single oral dose to rats (8/group) at dose levels of 0 (vehicle), 200, 600, and 2000 
mg/kg. Respiratory function was measured before dosing, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after 
dosing. 
It was concluded that baloxavir marboxil had no effect on respiratory rate, tidal volume, or minute 
volume at 200, 600, or 2000 mg/kg. This view is supported. Unfortunately, this study was not 
supported with toxicokinetics. It is expected that toxicokinetic data from study 1088993 can be used 
as supportive data 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
The bioanalytical method to support pivotal GLP-compliant repeat-dose studies in rat, monkey and 
rabbit were presented in report 1089187. Selectivity, carry-over, calibration curves, precision and 
accuracy, matrix effects and stability of working solutions and samples appear to be successfully 
evaluated.  
One more validation study was conducted for a method in rat plasma (Report 1089188). This report 
(1089188) describes the validation of the bioanalytical method in rat plasma. In order to cover the 
bioanalysis in the Phototoxicity study, a bioanalytical method was also validated in mouse plasma. In 
all in vivo studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology) units of ng/mL plasma has been used. 
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic studies of baloxavir marboxil were conducted in mice, ferrets, rats and monkeys, with 
the latter two species informing the majority of nonclinical PK. Studies were also conducted in juvenile 
and pregnant rats. Efficacy-based PK was investigated in influenza A-infected mice. Based on the 
hydrolysis of baloxavir marboxil to baloxavir in vivo, absorption studies measured baloxavir 
concentrations in plasma (or blood) following single or repeated oral administrations. After single 
administrations baloxavir concentrations reached Cmax at approximately 0.5- 5 hours depending on 
the nonclinical species. Studies with radiolabelled baloxavir marboxil identified that 90% and 80% of 
radioactivity was representative of baloxavir in monkeys and rats, respectively. In all studies baloxavir 
marboxil was below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) at almost all time points. Thus, the PK 
studies describe the ADME of the active moiety, baloxavir.  
Pivotal studies align with the intended route of administration and proposed dosing regimen of a single 
oral dose. Dose-proportional baloxavir exposure was evident in both rats and monkeys up to 3 mg/kg 
and 10 mg/kg, respectively, indicating a linear PK profile. Linearity at doses up to 15 mg/kg was also 
observed in mice infected with influenza A. 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 27/159 
 
 
  
  
 
Other PK parameters including Vdss, total clearance and t1/2, were consistent across doses in both rats 
and monkeys. Bioavailability ranged between 9.77-14.7% in rats and monkeys and was not 
significantly affected by fasting. Key PK differences in adult rats include an extended Tmax in monkeys 
versus rats (5.33 vs. 1.25 hours) and a significant food effect in monkeys. 
Administration of baloxavir marboxil under fasting conditions with metal ions (calcium, iron, and 
mixture of magnesium and aluminium) found reduced exposure of 14-15% in monkeys (Cmax and 
AUC0-inf), closely mirroring observations from the food effect observed in humans. It was hypothesized 
that the food effect associated with baloxavir is due to chelate formation with metal ions in the 
gastrointestinal lumen, thereby reducing absorption. The findings in primates support this.  
Administration of baloxavir marboxil in juvenile rats identified higher absorption of baloxavir (Cmax 
and AUC0-inf) in animals aged 10 days-old compared to 20- or 30-day old rats, possibly due to relative 
immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract in rats, which is not considered to be relevant to paediatric 
dosing. Further discussion on this could be warranted; however, in light of the proposed indication for 
children aged 12 years or over juvenile PK is adequately assessed. The Cmax and AUC0-24hr values of 
baloxavir after repeated administration were lower than those after first administration in rats and 
rabbits, while higher than those after first administration in monkeys. 
Distribution 
Distribution of baloxavir was investigated in pigmented rats and pregnant rats. In pigmented rats the 
highest concentrations of radioactivity were identified in the intestinal mucosa and liver. There was no 
significant retention of baloxavir in melanin-containing tissue.  
Placental transfer of baloxavir was observed at approximately 50% that of maternal tissues, again 
exposure in foetal bones was present at all of the time points and Cmax was achieved at 48 hours (last 
sampling time point). Relatively high radioactivity in blood cells of male rats and monkeys (non-
fasting) was observed in samples up to 24 and 48 hours, respectively. At 24 hours, concentrations of 
baloxavir were low indicating retention in blood cells is unlikely. In monkeys, relatively high blood cell 
distribution was maintained, at a similar degree to plasma concentrations suggesting that baloxavir 
marboxil is unlikely to remain in blood cells. 
Metabolism 
Hydrolysis of baloxavir marboxil in the liver is similar across nonclinical species and humans; however, 
intestinal hydrolysis is more rapidly achieved in humans (81.8% vs. 51.1% in rat and 43% in monkey, 
1 h post-dose). Hydrolysis of baloxavir marboxil to baloxavir is mediated by serine esterases, 
predominantly AADAC in humans. In metabolism studies, after a single oral administration of 
[14C]baloxavir marboxil at 5 mg/kg to rats and at 3 mg/kg to monkeys under a non-fasting condition, 
baloxavir was detected as the major component in plasma. Additional metabolites were investigated 
using human hepatocytes. Baloxavir was found to undergo further metabolic reactions via oxidation 
and glucuronidation. Baloxavir glucuronide and two kinds of baloxavir sulfoxides were identified. 
Baloxavir glucuronide was present at AUC ratios exceeding 10% (16.4%) in the human mass balance 
study. Thus, based on this clinical evidence baloxavir glucuronide exceeded the safety specifications for 
ICH M3 R2, and was further evaluated; however, it was considered to be of low toxicological concern.  
Abundance ratios were applied to absorption data from the 2-week repeat dose study in monkeys 
(based on metabolic profiling study in monkeys). An abundance ratio of 3% in monkeys and 16.4% in 
humans derives an estimated baloxavir glucuronide exposure of 672 ng.hr/mL and an actual human 
exposure of 628 ng.hr/mL from the mass balance study. The applicant considered that the safety of 
baloxavir glucuronide has been adequately addressed. This is supported. In summary, baloxavir 
glucuronide exposure at the NOAEL in the monkey study was approximately equivalent to the human 
exposure in the mass balance study, and as per ICH M3 R(2) exposure of 50% or greater in of the 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 28/159 
 
 
  
  
metabolite in nonclinical species (relative to therapeutic exposure) is considered sufficient for safety 
evaluation. Also, the absence of histopathological correlates to the findings at the high dose of 200 
mg/kg it is accepted that the exposure at this dose is acceptable and further contributes to the safety 
evaluation, suggesting low risk with this metabolite.  
Based on human mass balance study the metabolism of baloxavir is predominantly via glucuronidation 
(via UGT1A3 enzyme). Oxidation to sulfoxide metabolites are mediated via CYP3A4.  Baloxavir was 
found to inhibit CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 enzymes in human liver microsomes. Baloxavir has 
some induction potential for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4, although with lesser potency (<20% effect 
of positive controls), thus the potential for inducible effects of baloxavir is low. In liver microsomes 
isolated from rats dosed at 2000 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, induction of CYP2B and CYP3A was observed 
with a pronounced effect for CYP3A induction in female rats (31-fold). Given the predominance of 
glucuronidation metabolism of baloxavir, a clinical DDI study was performed. Unexpectedly, plasma 
exposure of baloxavir was decreased in the presence of the pan-UGT inhibitor probenecid. This 
reduction of 21-25% suggests there is an unexplained effect.  
Excretion 
Faecal excretion accounted for 96.6% of radiolabelled baloxavir marboxil (0.4% urine) in bile-duct 
cannulated male rats (1 mg/kg dose oral). Based on urinary and bile excretion, the absorbed dose was 
approximately 19% in this study. After oral administration of radiolabelled baloxavir marboxil 80% of 
dose was not absorbed and no faecal baloxavir was detectable (due to hydrolysis in GI tract). 
Enterohepatic circulation of baloxavir is observed in rats (0.9% of radioactively) but was associated 
with minimal effects on PK. Baloxavir was detected in breast milk of nursing rats up to 8 hours and 
was undetected at 24 hours. In monkeys, faecal excretion accounted for 89.5% of administered 
radiolabelled baloxavir, the absorption ratio was approximately 10% in bile-duct cannulated male 
monkeys. Similar to rats, minimal baloxavir was measured in faeces following oral administration. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In-vitro studies were conducted to investigate the potential for inhibition of metabolizing enzymes and 
inhibition and/or induction of drug transporters. Appropriate concentrations of baloxavir marboxil 
baloxavir were used and study conditions were in line with relevant guidance (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 
1 Corr. 2**). Based on the studies conducted, baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir had low potential to 
inhibit human CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) and 
to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4, suggesting that baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir are unlikely 
to affect the PK of drugs that are substrates for CYPs. Baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir were 
substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not substrates of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, or OATP1B3. Baloxavir marboxil has a potential to 
inhibit the P–gp-mediated transport, but not to inhibit the BCRP-mediated transport. Baloxavir has a 
potential to inhibit the transport mediated by P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, organic cation transporter (OCT) 
1, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, and MATE2-K, but not to inhibit the transport mediated by 
OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, OCT2, and bile salt export pump (BSEP). A clinical 
DDI study confirmed that baloxavir marboxil minimally altered PK of P-gp and BCRP substrates to a 
degree that is not considered to have an effect on drugs that are substrates for these transporters. 
DDI studies have calculated the IC50 for substrate and transporter assessments. The use of IC50 was 
adequately justified.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose studies were conducted with baloxavir marboxil. Instead, acute toxicity was evaluated 
on basis of findings in the repeat dose studies in rats and monkeys. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
No mortality, moribund condition or acute clinical signs was observed in rats in doses up to 2000 
mg/kg. In male monkeys dosed with 200 and 400 mg/kg loose stool, diarrhoea and vomiting was 
observed, however, in another study in monkeys, no deaths, moribund condition or clinical signs was 
observed in doses up to 200 mg/kg. 
Baloxavir marboxil was investigated in repeat dose studies in monkeys and rats for 2 and 4 weeks. As 
the product is only intended for single dose use, the duration of the repeat dose studies are 
acceptable.  
In the 2- and 4-week rat studies, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial 
thromboplastin time (APTT) were observed at 200 mg/kg/day or higher. This was attributed by the 
applicant to vitamin K deficiency due to fasting of the animals and autoclavation of the animal feed. 
This was further elucidated in a study investigating the impact of vitamin K supplementary as 
described below, which showed that prolongation of PT and APTT did not occur when rats where 
supplemented with vitamin K. Conditions for fasting in the 2- and 4-week repeat dose study was 
similar to the conditions used in the investigative study (i.e. all animals in the main study were fasted 
for at least 16 hours prior to necropsy. Under the fasted condition, metal grid floors were put in the 
cages).  
Increased weight of liver, hypertrophy of hepatocytes, hyperplasia of follicular epithelium in the 
thyroid, decreased colloid in the thyroid, and hypertrophy of basophilic cells in the pituitary were also 
observed at all doses. The applicant proposed these findings are rat-specific compensatory changes 
caused by the increased clearance of T3/T4 that is associated with the increased activities of CYP2B 
and CYP3A accompanied by an increased total content of CYP, and an increased activity of UGT in the 
liver due to a lack of thyroxine binding globulin (TBG). This was considered mild in severity without any 
degenerative changes which the applicant considered is unlikely to be relevant to humans. The 
accelerated clearance of T3/T4 indeed appears to be a species-specific effect in rats. The applicant has 
postulated a number of potential factors that contribute to the heightened sensitivity to increased T4 
clearance in rats compared to humans. This is supported. The most relevant discussion herein relates 
to any clinically meaningful effects of enhanced T3/T4 clearance in conditions with TBG-deficiency. In 
situations of partial or total TBG deficiency, the impact on bioactive free T4 does not appear to be 
altered and clinical manifestations of TBG deficiency are generally absent. Additionally, the intended 
posology of baloxavir marboxil as a single dose suggests that it is unlikely to induce prolonged 
alteration of thyroid hormones.  
Observed changes in liver were also considered adaptive changes to the induction of CYP enzymes, not 
considered clinically relevant. Overall, it appears that the effects at 20 and 200 mg/kg/day were not 
clinically relevant and the NOAEL in the repeat dose studies in rats is established at 2000 mg/kg/day.   
In monkeys, hepato-biliary changes were observed at most dose levels, including increases in alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), leucyl 
aminopeptidase (LAP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Changes was also observed in one 
female (out of 6 animals) at 3 mg/kg/day, however, as no changes were observed at 10 mg/kg this is 
considered incidental. Effects observed at the end of the dosing period in both the 2- and 4-week study 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 30/159 
 
 
  
  
were fully or partly returned to normal after the recovery period. The NOAEL in the repeat dose studies 
in monkeys is considered to be 10 mg/kg/day. 
Generally, the safety margins in the repeat dose toxicity and juvenile toxicity studies were low (1.7-
5.4). It is furthermore noted that AUC stated by the applicant is at 40 mg/day and not 80 kg/day, 
which is the highest intended clinical dose. The indicated safety margins therefore do not reflect the 
assumedly highest AUC values in humans. However, the derived NOAELs from animals is based on 
repeated dosing, whereas the dosing in humans is only intended as a single dose. It is therefore 
assumed that a sufficient margin is achieved to human relevant doses. This is further discussed in the 
pharmacokinetic section under repeat dose absorption.  In juvenile rats at the beginning of dosing at 
D10 exposures are high, however, this is considered due to age related kinetics, which is further 
discussed in the pharmacokinetic section. At the end of dosing at D30, exposures and safety margins 
are similar to the 2- and 4-week repeat dose studies.  
In summary, on the basis of comparative exposure levels in the toxicity studies, adverse effects in 
general occurred above therapeutic plasma levels of baloxavir. 
Genotoxicity 
In vitro and in vivo tests performed with baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir showed no genotoxic 
potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
No studies investigating the carcinogenic potential of baloxavir marboxil have been submitted. 
However, treatment with baloxavir marboxil is only intended as single dose per influenza season, i.e. 
not less than 6 months in between. Furthermore, no genotoxic potential was established for baloxavir 
marboxil and it was not shown to accumulate or remain in any specific tissue. Therefore, it is accepted 
that no carcinogenic studies are submitted for baloxavir marboxil. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Baloxavir marboxil was investigated for potential effects on male and female fertility at doses up to 
1000 mg/kg. No treatment related deaths occurred. No treatment related adverse changes in 
macropathology, reproductive organ weights, number of sperm cells in testes in males or estrous cycle 
in females were observed. Additionally, no baloxavir marboxil-related changes in copulation index, 
fertility index, copulation interval, the numbers of corpora lutea, implantations, and live embryos, and 
pre- and post-implantation loss rate were confirmed in any groups.  Toxicokinetics (TK) was not 
investigated in this study, however, plasma concentration measurements in dams from the embryo-
foetal development study in rats indicated sufficient exposure at the same dose levels. 
In rats, baloxavir marboxil was orally administered at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day to investigate 
effects on embryo-foetal effects. No deaths occurred and no treatment related changes in pre- and 
post-implantation loss rate, number of live foetuses, sex ratio, foetal body weight as well as skeletal 
morphology in live foetuses were observed. Sufficient exposure was shown in the TK investigations 
with an exposure margin of 4.2 to human relevant doses. 
In rabbits, baloxavir marboxil was administered orally in doses of 30, 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day to 
investigate effects on embryo-foetal effects. No deaths occurred, however, two of 19 animals in the 
1000 mg/kg/day group and 1 of 20 animals in the control group aborted on G25 or G26. A decrease in 
body weight accompanied by marked decrease in food consumption was observed in the 2 animals that 
aborted in the 1000 mg/kg/day. In foetuses, the incidence of thoracolumbar full supernumerary rib 
(11.42%) at 1000 mg/kg/day was lower than that in the control group (51.86%) and the historical 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 31/159 
 
 
  
  
control data (26.83% to 73.06%). It is agreed that this finding does not seem to be of toxicological 
concern. 
The incidence of an extra cervical rib (33.70%) at 1000 mg/kg/day was, however, significantly higher 
than that in the control group (0%) and the historical control data (0% to 2.73%) and occurred in all 
litters. Other than the findings stated above, no maternal toxicity was observed at any dose levels. In 
humans, a cervical rib can cause symptoms known as thoracic outlet syndrome and the finding may 
therefore be clinically relevant. Public literature indicates that a large prevalence of cervical ribs can be 
observed in animal studies, which may differ between the species and strain and has been associated 
with maternal stress during the gestational period, and furthermore, that the cervical ribs seem to be 
resorbed postnatally. Though a large incidence of cervical ribs has also observed in human foetuses, it 
is assumed that they are resorbed in a similar manner postnatally, as the prevalence of cervical ribs in 
adults are very limited, thus resulting in limited clinical relevance. NOAEL was established at 100 
mg/kg/day based on the skeletal findings and abortions.  
To investigate embryo-foetal developmental toxicity, baloxavir marboxil was administered orally to 
pregnant rats at dose levels of 20, 200 and 2000 mg/kg. No maternal toxicity was observed in F0 
dams. In F1 pups, no treatment-related changes were observed except for a small number of 
observations of anterior chamber hyphaema resulting in unilaterally enlargement of the eyeball with 
dark red discoloration, which was first observed at opening of eyes at day 16 to 20 after birth (2 of 176 
F1 pups (1.1%) and 4 of 168 F1 pups (2.4%) at 200 and 2000 mg/kg, respectively). The applicant 
argues that the incidence level is low and that the observed hyphaema only occurred unilaterally.  
No abnormal findings were seen in the eyeballs of pups in the historical control data, however, the 
applicant suspects that lack of appropriate routine examinations may be the cause of the lack of 
findings. The applicant argues that the morphologic structure of the eyes was intact, so it is unlikely 
that the observed haemorrhage was caused by dysmorphogenesis during prenatal development. 
Additionally, in the historical control data regarding spontaneous lesions in the eyes of Sprague Dawley 
rats, adhesion of tissues in the anterior chamber of the eye occurred in rats aged 6 weeks at an 
incidence of 0% to 1.74%, which indicates a similar mechanism of bleeding in the anterior segment of 
the eye that was found in this PPND study. Thus, the applicant considers these ocular findings to be 
most likely incidental and of no known toxicological consequence, despite the statistical significance in 
the high dose group. This is accepted and the ocular findings in the PPND study is considered of limited 
clinical concern. TK was not investigated in this study, however, plasma concentration measurements 
in dams from the embryo-foetal development study in rats indicated sufficient exposure at the same 
dose levels. 
In the juvenile toxicity study, rats were dosed with 20, 200 and 1000 mg/kg. No mortalities occurred 
and only few effects were observed. Changes to body weight, body weight gain (200 mg/kg or higher) 
and in food consumption (all doses) were observed, however, the changes were considered transient 
and slight and thus not considered toxicologically significant. In haematological examinations changes 
were observed in red blood cell distribution width, prolongation of APTT/increase in PLT and 
albumin/globulin content. The changes were considered transient and no related clinical or 
histopathological changes were observed. Effects on APTT has already been discussed in the 
assessment of the 2- and 4-week repeat dose study in rats. Investigational studies have shown that 
prolonged APTT may be attributed to the lack of vitamin K due to fasting and/or in the feed. In the 
juvenile study, the feed was removed overnight before blood sampling for haematology and blood 
chemistry, thus indicating that the rats were not fasted for as long as in the investigational and repeat 
dose studies. Furthermore, it is not mentioned whether a grid is placed on the floor prior to blood 
sampling to prevent access to faeces and whether the animal feed were autoclaved in this study. 
Follicular cell hypertrophy in the thyroid was observed in males and females at 200 mg/kg/day or 
higher combined with an increase in thyroid weight. The same effects were observed in the 2- and 4-
week repeat dose studies in rats, in which it was accepted that the effects are not considered clinically 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 32/159 
 
 
  
  
relevant due to the rat specific induction of liver microsomal enzymes resulting in compensatory 
morphological changes in the thyroid and pituitary. 
It appears that no toxicologically significant effects are observed in juvenile rats, and the NOAEL for 
the study is established at 1000 mg/kg. High plasma concentrations of baloxavir were measured at the 
beginning of dosing at D10 of age, however, the levels normalised at the end of the study where 
plasma concentrations in rats at D30 and D49 of age were comparable to concentrations in rats at 
similar age in 2- and 4-week repeat-dose studies. Thus, an age-related change in the toxicokinetics of 
baloxavir marboxil is observed. This is further discussed in the pharmacokinetic section. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics are discussed in the pharmacokinetic section under repeat-dose absorption. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was investigated as part of the repeat-dose toxicity and safety pharmacology studies 
and no further local tolerance studies have been submitted 
Other toxicity studies 
A large number of impurities were identified for baloxavir marboxil stemming from the route of 
synthesis. The substances have been evaluated according to the ICH M7 guideline concerning their 
mutagenic potential using in silico modelling, investigated in GLP compliant Ames tests as well as 
referenced from published literature. Discussions of the genotoxic classification according to ICH M7 
appear to be adequate. Measures to ensure adequate control of the genotoxic impurities are discussed 
in the quality part of the assessment. 
Four related substances and baloxavir as well as three sterioisomers have been included in the drug 
substance specification. All impurities have shown negative mutagenic potential in in silico modelling 
and experimental testing, which is accepted. The three sterioisomers are included in the specifications 
at a limit of 0.15%, thus not triggering the requirement for qualification of the impurities according to 
ICH Q3A. However, the four related impurities are included in levels above 0.15%, and the applicant 
has thus performed a qualification of the impurities. 
The specification limit is considered to be covered by the impurity content in the toxicological batches. 
The applicant states that one of the related substances is converted to baloxavir during degradation. 
By comparing impurity content in the batches used in the toxicological investigations during the course 
of the study, it is observed that the amount of that related substance is decreased and baloxavir is 
increased, respectively, from study start until the end of the study. The amounts of impurity measured 
at the end of the toxicological study in monkeys in the relevant batches are thus lower than the 
specified amount for baloxavir and the related substance mentioned above. However, baloxavir is 
considered the main active metabolite of baloxavir marboxil (83% conversion during 24h in monkeys) 
and thus baloxavir is considered qualified by toxicological testing. 
Further, the four related substances are considered qualified by converting the NOAEL established in 
the 4-week monkey study (10 mg/kg/day). A NOAEL for the impurities was derived by estimating the 
relative NOAEL values for the impurities based on the impurity content in the toxicological batches by 
the end of the study. By deriving the daily dose corresponding to the upper specification limit, it seems 
that a sufficient margin from the upper dose specification limit to the impurity NOAELs can be 
established, and the four related substances are considered qualified by toxicological testing.  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 33/159 
 
 
  
  
Five residual solvents have been included in the specification with limits in compliance with those 
stated in the ICH Q3C guideline.  
In an investigation of phototoxic potential of baloxavir marboxil UV visible absorption was observed at 
two wavelengths, 261 and 304.6 nm, both with a molar extinction coefficient greater than 1000 
L/mol/cm.  
A photohaemolysis assay was conducted to investigate the phototoxic potential in vitro. Baloxavir 
marboxil was positive in photohaemolysis index, whereas baloxavir was negative in photohaemolysis 
index or met-haemoglobin formation. 
A skin phototoxicity study on baloxavir marboxil in hairless mice was conducted via oral and 
intraperitoneal administration. Baloxavir marboxil was administered to female Hos:HR-1 mice (5 or 10 
females/group) once at 0 (control group) or 1000 mg/kg orally, or at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg 
intraperitoneally and animals were investigated for skin reactions after the exposure of UV light. No 
skin reactions indicative of phototoxicity occurred in any baloxavir marboxil-treated groups, whereas 
the positive control induced skin reactions indicative of phototoxicity. 
The applicant has performed investigational studies in rats to elucidate the effect of fasting and vitamin 
K supplementary on PT and APTT, which were increased in the 2- and 4-week repeat dose studies in 
rats as well in the study in juvenile rats treated with baloxavir marboxil. According to the applicant, the 
effects could be due to fasting of the animals before necropsy (16 h or more) and autoclavation of the 
animal feed both reducing the vitamin K levels in the rats. Furthermore, it is noted that in the repeat 
dose studies as well as in the investigational study, metal grid floors were put in the cages thus 
preventing access of the rats to the faeces and another potential source of vitamin K. 
In investigational studies on the effect of vitamin K on PT and APTT, it appears that baloxavir marboxil 
in itself may have an effect on PT and APTT. Prolongation of PT and APTT are observed in rats at 200 
mg/kg in the 2- and 4-week repeat dose study, which correlates with clinically relevant dose levels 
(200 mg/kg exposure margin = 1; 20 mg/kg (NOAEL): exposure margin = 0.5 (based on AUC24h)). 
The apparent vitamin K deficiency is not commonly observed in studies in rats, though the fasting 
period (16 h or more) and type of fodder does not seem out of the ordinary in order to explain the 
observed effects. Prolongation of PT and APTT was however not observed in monkeys at any dose 
level. A summary of a review of haemorrhagic events in humans based on post-marketing data was 
presented by the applicant, in which is it concluded that there is no association with treatment with 
baloxavir marboxil, which is further supported by the lack of direct findings on prolongation of PT or 
APTT in the clinical trials. Furthermore, it was pointed out that there are large differences in the 
required amount of vitamin K between rats and humans. Thus, vitamin K deficiency is not commonly 
observed in humans as vitamin K sources are more readily available through the diet and since smaller 
amounts are required than in rats. Taking the provided information into consideration as well as the 
fact that baloxavir marboxil is only intended as a single dose in humans whereas it was given as 
repeated dosing in rats for up to 4 weeks, it seems that the observed prolongation of PT and APTT in 
rats have limited clinical relevance. Although the dose-dependent effect of baloxavir on PT and APPT in 
rat appear to be of limited clinical relevance, clinical findings of spontaneous bleeding may not be 
separated from bleeding induced by influenza virus. The effect on PT and APTT in the rat has been 
adequately reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted to the active form baloxavir through metabolism. The 
active form selectively inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN), an influenza virus-specific 
enzyme in the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase complex, which thereby 
inhibits influenza virus replication. 
Baloxavir was evaluated in a range of in vitro and in vivo infection models and the potency and dosing 
regimens was compared to already marketed neuramidine (NA) inhibitors primarily oseltamivir 
(Tamiflu). Baloxavir was shown to be more potent than other marketed products in vitro. In vivo 
studies showed that baloxavir marboxil provided adequate efficacy with treatment for only one day BID 
at lower doses than oseltamivir, whereas oseltamivir required 5 days treatment to show significant 
effect on viral shedding and/or survival. Baloxavir marboxil was effective against large range of 
influenza virus, including A, B, neuramidine resistant, avian etc.  
In a disease model of delayed treatment, mice were inoculated with a lethal dose of virus (A/PR/8/34) 
and treated with baloxavir marboxil at 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours after. Here it was demonstrated that 
treatment with baloxavir marboxil up to initiation 72 hours after inoculation, provided full survival. 
Exposure to baloxavir was followed in some disease models. From a nonclinical point of view, 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 36/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposure-response relationship and the posology (single dose within 48 hours of onset of symptoms) 
in patients appear to be justified. 
In vitro and in vivo proof of concept is considered well established. 
As for safety pharmacology, baloxavir appear selective for the intended viral target, show high margin 
to cellular toxicity, low potential for interaction with cardiovascular targets (hERG, guinea pig papillary 
muscle) and showed no clinically relevant adverse effects in the in vivo CV safety study in monkey. No 
indication of impact on respiratory or CNS system was revealed in rat.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in with mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys, and ferrets, which were 
also selected for toxicological assessment. PK assessment was performed after single oral 
administration as is intended clinically. Baloxavir marboxil was below the limit of quantification at early 
time points in most studies confirming rapid hydrolysis to baloxavir. Baloxavir displayed a linear PK 
profile with generally no evidence of accumulation in tissues. Baloxavir-glucuronide is the major 
metabolite in humans. A revised acceptable safety evaluation of the baloxavir-glucuronide metabolite 
was presented.  
Toxicology 
In general, baloxavir marboxil is considered of low toxic potential in toxicological relevant species in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies. Furthermore, it is not considered of genotoxic potential or to affect male 
and female fertility. Developmental findings in the EFD study in rabbits as well as the PPND study 
appears to be of limited clinical relevance.  
In investigational studies on the effect of vitamin K on PT and APTT, it appears that baloxavir marboxil 
in itself may have an effect on PT and APTT. Prolongation of PT and APTT are observed in rats at 200 
mg/kg in the 2- and 4-week repeat dose study, which correlates with clinically relevant dose levels 
(200 mg/kg: exposure margin = 1; 20 mg/kg (NOAEL): exposure margin= 0.5 (based on AUC24h)). 
The apparent vitamin K deficiency is not commonly observed in studies in rats, though the fasting 
period (16 h or more) and type of fodder does not seem out of the ordinary in order to explain the 
observed effects. Prolongation of PT and APTT was however not observed in monkeys at any dose 
level. A summary of a review of haemorrhagic events in humans based on post-marketing data was 
presented by the applicant, showing no association with treatment with baloxavir marboxil, which is 
further supported by the lack of direct findings on prolongation of PT or APTT in the clinical trials. 
Furthermore, there are large differences in the required amount of vitamin K between rats and humans 
supporting that vitamin K deficiency is not commonly observed in humans as vitamin K sources are 
more readily available through the diet and since smaller amounts are required than in rats. Baloxavir 
marboxil is only intended as a single dose in humans whereas it was given as repeated dosing in rats 
for up to 4 weeks. Taken together, it seems that the observed prolongation of PT and APTT in rats 
have limited clinical relevance. The effect on PT and APTT in the rat has been adequately reflected in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A vast program of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology was conducted in disease models for baloxavir 
marboxil. Nonclinical proof of concept as an antiviral agent against influenza virus appear well-
established. Safety pharmacology revealed no concerns on CNS, CV or respiratory safety.  
Pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil is well described. 
The toxicological programme of baloxavir marboxil consisted of 2- and 4- week repeat dose studies in 
rats and monkeys. Furthermore, the genotoxic potential was investigated as well as studies on fertility 
and developmental toxicity. Considering the clinical administration of single dose only, the toxicological 
programme is considered sufficient to address the intended use of baloxavir marboxil. 
Overall, from the nonclinical part of the dossier is considered satisfactory.  There are no remaining 
non-clinical issues precluding granting of a Marketing authorisation. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. GCP non-
compliance identified during site audits of Study T0832 (critical and major deviations) have been 
handled appropriately by excluding the vast majority of the patients from the sites with non-
compliance.   
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods and dosing 
Methods 
Bioanalytical analysis 
The bioanalytical method for the simultaneous determination of concentrations of baloxavir marboxil 
(bxm) and baloxavir in human plasma was validated where the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 
set to 0.100 ng/mL for both baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir. Plasma samples were analysed after  
deproteinization by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method.  
The analytical methods were validated across the calibration range with respect to selectivity, 
recovery, accuracy, precision, and stability under a variety of conditions. 
Concentrations of baloxavir in human nasal or throat swab samples collected in the global phase 3 
study T0831 was determined using LC/MS/MS. Nasal or throat swab samples were analysed after 
deproteinization. The bioanalytical method was validated with the LLOQ of 0.0500 ng/mL. 
Validated bioanalytical methods for the determination of oseltamivir/oseltamivir carboxylate, digoxin, 
midazolam, moxifloxacin, itraconazole, rosuvastatin, and probenecid were also established.  
PK parameters 
Biologic samples for PK determination of bxm/baloxavir were collected in both single and multiple dose 
studies and in both phase 1, 2, and 3 studies in healthy volunteers and patients. The measurements 
comprised standard PK parameters, and the results were evaluated in the individual studies as well as 
in population PK analyses.  
Population PK and PKPD analyses. 
PK data were analysed in a pop PK model. The population PK model was used to calculate Bayesian 
estimations of PK parameters in individual OwH and HR patients, to evaluate the effects of selected 
covariates, and to estimate the PK/PD responses in the populations. The final model was based on data 
from 10 phase 1 studies, one phase 2 study, and phase 3 studies in OwH and HR subjects, and a total 
of 11848 baloxavir plasma concentrations from 1827 subjects including adolescents aged ≥ 12 years 
were used for population pharmacokinetic analyses. The models are adequately described and 
validated. 
The PK of baloxavir was well described using a three-compartment model with first-order elimination 
and absorption processes and a lag time. Significant covariates contained in the final model were 
gender, body weight, and race.  
The population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates of the final model are shown in Table 1 .

Table 1 Population Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Final Model 
Dosing regimen 
In the clinical trials, a body weight-based dosing regimen was used. Patients weighing < 80 kg received 
40 mg bxm as a single dose and patients weighing ≥ 80 kg received a single dose of 80 mg. 
In the PEP study, the children enrolled received the following dose: weight <10 kg: 1 mg/kg, weight 
10-<20 kg: 10 mg, weight 20-<40 kg: 20 mg, and weight ≥40 kg: 40 mg. 
Absorption 
Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug and after oral administration, bxm is extensively converted to its active 
metabolite, baloxavir, predominantly by AADAC in the gastrointestinal lumen, intestinal epithelium, 
and liver. The plasma concentration of bxm was very low or below the limit of quantitation (< 0.100 
ng/mL) at all time points. 
Solubility of bxm is independent of pH in the range of 1 to 9. Therefore, a change in stomach pH is not 
expected to affect the absorption of bxm. 
Distribution 
The in vitro serum protein-binding ratios of baloxavir were 92.9% to 93.9%. In clinical studies, the 
apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was estimated to be 1180 L in non-Asians and 619 L (i.e. about 
50% lower) in Japanese healthy subjects after single oral doses of 80 mg bxm.   
Bioavailability 
The absolute oral bioavailability of bxm/baloxavir has not been established. 
The PK of baloxavir in healthy adults (n=12, 9 white and 3 African American) receiving 80 mg of bxm 
is seen in Table 2 . Time to achieve peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of baloxavir was reached 
4 hours after administration, the elimination half-life was 79.1 hours, the geometric mean 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 44/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
(% geometric CV) of the Cmax and AUC0-infof baloxavir were 145 ng/mL (25.4%) and 6551 ng • hr/mL 
(22.5%), respectively. 
Table 2 Pharmacokinetic Parameters of baloxavir following Single Oral Administration of 
Baloxavir Marboxil at 80 mg to Healthy Adults in the Fasted State  
Bioequivalence 
All the phase 3 clinical studies used two or four of the to-be-marketed 20 mg tablets to deliver the 
40 mg or 80 mg dose. A biowaiver will be applied for a bioavailability and/or bioequivalence study 
between the to-be-marketed 20 mg film-coated tablet formulation and the to-be-marketed 40 mg film-
coated tablet formulation (previously granted by the FDA). 
Bioequivalence between the granules for paediatric use and the to-be-marketed 20 mg tablet was 
demonstrated in a BE study.

A food-effect study involving oral administration of one 20 mg bxm tablet (phase 1 and phase 2 clinical 
formulation) to healthy subjects under fasting conditions or taken with a moderate meal containing 
dairy (approximately 400 to 500 kcal, of which 150 kcal was from fat) indicated that food decreased 
the Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf of baloxavir by 47%, 37%, and 37%, respectively. However, in the 
large phase II/III studies, the effect of food was minimal and the efficacy was not affected by 
concomitant food intake. An in vivo study indicated that baloxavir is chelated by polyvalent cations and 
due to the risk of chelation, it is recommended that bxm should not be taken with polyvalent 
cation-containing laxatives or antacids, or oral supplements containing iron, zinc, selenium, calcium, or 
magnesium. 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of baloxavir is long (79.1 hours). The apparent clearance of baloxavir differ 
substantially between Asians (5.6 L/h) and non-Asians (10.8 L7h) but the terminal half-life is only 
slightly lower in Non-Asians. This is explained by the larger Vd in the non-Asians. Bxm is thought to be 
hydrolyzed by AADAC, a serine esterase, in the small intestine and liver. The metabolite baloxavir is 
the active agent. Baloxavir is subject to biliary secretion and is primarily excreted via feces. Baloxavir 
is only sparsely excreted in the urine (3.3%).  
Metabolites 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 45/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In plasma, baloxavir was the main entity accounting for 82.2% of total radioactivity. Other metabolites 
were baloxavir glucuronide and baloxavir sulfoxide, accounting for 16.4% and 1.5% of total 
radioactivity in plasma, respectively. The PK and potential for DDIs of baloxavir glucuronide have not 
been reported. 
Inter-conversion 
After single oral dosing of baloxavir marboxil, no measurable levels of prodrug were detected, and only 
the baloxavir stereoisomer was found. Hence, baloxavir is not interconverted into any of its other 
stereoisomers in human. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 
to infinity (AUC0-inf) increased in an essentially dose-proportional manner in the clinical studies 
regardless of formulation, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics of baloxavir over the entire clinical dose 
range of bxm tested, i.e., at least up to 80 mg. This applied to both Asian and Non-Asian healthy 
volunteers.  
Intra- and interindividual variability 
Inter-individual variability was estimated on the absorption rate constant (Ka), the oral clearance 
(CL/F), the apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F) and the apparent peripheral volume of 
distribution (Vp/F) in the final pop PK model. The interindividual variability in the selected PK 
parameters estimated in the final pop PK model varied between 29% and 124% (Table 1  above).  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Very similar exposures have been demonstrated when comparing the baloxavir exposure (AUC0-inf, 
Cmax, and C24) in the OwH and HR populations, indicating that HR factors did not impact oral drug 
clearance or bioavailability of baloxavir in a relevant manner. From Table 3 it is noted that a non-Asian 
subject receiving 80 mg of bxm is likely to have the same exposure as an Asian subject receiving 40 
mg of bxm. A non-Asian subject receiving 40 mg of bxm will have the lowest exposure (35-37 ng/mL 
in terms of C24).

Cmax, AUC0-inf: Bayesian estimation based on the OwH population pharmacokinetic model. 
Observed C24: the observed plasma concentrations at 20 to 28 hours post-dose. 
Arithmetic mean (minimum-maximum) are shown for all PK parameters. 
PK in the PEP population 
Bayesian-estimates of AUC0−inf, Cmax, C24, C72, C240 by age category and dose are summarized in Table 
4 below. 
In subjects ≥12 years, the mean C24 and AUC0−inf in the 80 mg dose group was 37%−38% higher 
compared to subjects in the 40 mg dose group (Table 4 below), which is consistent with the exposure 
increase seen with the 80 mg dose in Asian patients compared with the 40 mg dose in the treatment 
studies (T0831 and T0832, Table 3). With the 40 mg dose, the individual PK parameters were 
comparable between subjects ≥12 years and <12 years of age, although the subjects <12 years 
receiving the 40 mg dose were limited (n=4). 
Estimated plasma concentrations of baloxavir by age, dose, and race on day 1 to 15 after drug 
administration is shown in Table 5 below.

Special populations 
When comparing Cmax, AUC0-inf and C24 across the different phase 1 studies in healthy Japanese and 
American adults, these parameters were about 45% to 50% lower in non-Japanese subjects compared 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 48/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
to Japanese subjects, and race (Asian vs. non-Asian) and body weight were significant covariates in 
the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The body weight-based dosing used in the phase 3 OwH 
(T0831) and HR (T0832) studies reduced the overall differences in drug exposure between Asian and 
non-Asian patients to about 30%. 
No dose adjustment is necessary due to gender or age in adolescents >12 years, in patients with mild 
to moderate hepatic impairment, or in patients with renal impairment. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
Baloxavir marboxil is a substrate for AADAC, UGT1A3 and CYP3A4. Furthermore, baloxavir marboxil 
and baloxavir are P-gp substrates but not substrates of BCRP. 
CYP inhibition: 
o 
Baloxavir marboxil inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (IC50 23.2 µmol/L for midazolam as 
substrate). 
o 
o 
Baloxavir inhibited CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 (IC50 43.2 µmol/L for midazolam as substrate; this 
compares with Cmax after a 40 mg dose in healthy Japanese adults of 0.25 µmol/L) in a 
concentration-dependent manner.  
Time-dependent inhibition by baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir was not observed.  
CYP induction:  
o 
o 
Baloxavir marboxil did not demonstrate potential to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4.  
Baloxavir marginally increased the mRNA levels of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 but no 
concomitant increase in CYP enzyme activity was seen.  
Transporter inhibition:  
Baloxavir marboxil was found to be an inhibitor of P-gp but did not inhibit BCRP.  
Baloxavir inhibited transport mediated by P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OCT1, MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
Baloxavir did not inhibit transport mediated by OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 or BSEP.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Baloxavir marboxil is a novel prodrug which is converted pre-systemically to the active form baloxavir 
through metabolism (hydrolysis). The active form selectively inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease, 
an influenza virus-specific enzyme in the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase 
complex, which thereby inhibits influenza virus replication.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Virus titre was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint and, together with the clinical endpoint time to 
alleviation of symptoms (TTAS), as a measure of the relationship between baloxavir plasma 
concentration and effect.  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 50/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect   
Exposure-response relationship has been examined in the phase 2 (T0821) and phase 3 studies 
(T0831, T0832, and T0834). Virus titer was examined separately in all 4 studies.  
PK-virus titer analysis 
Dose finding study (T0821), OwH Japanese subjects  
The relationship between the C24 of S-033447 and the change from baseline in the influenza virus titer 
on Day 2 (binned data) is provided in Figure 5. There was a correlation between the C24 of baloxavir 
and the change from baseline in the influenza virus titer on Day 2. An Emax model showed that a 
maximum anti-virus effect was almost reached for patients with the C24 greater than 20 ng/mL.

Figure 5 Relationship between C24 and Change from Baseline in Influenza Virus Titer on Day 
2 (Binned Data) 
Phase 3 OwH and HR studies 
Change in virus titer from baseline to day 2 was examined in the two phase 3 studies (T0831 and 
T0832) stratified by virus type. In OwH subjects, there was a numerically larger change in virus titer in 
subjects treated with bxm than placebo. In the bxm treated group, the change in virus titer was similar 
in subjects with the lowest baloxavir plasma concentration (<20 ng/ml) and highest baloxavir plasma 
concentration (≥60 ng/ml) indicating no exposure-response relationship.  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 52/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In HR subjects, there was also a numerically larger change in virus titer in subjects treated with bxm 
than placebo. In the bxm treated group there was a tendency towards a larger change in virus titer 
with higher baloxavir plasma concentration indicative of a positive exposure-response relationship 
without reaching a plateau.   
PK-efficacy analysis 
Time to alleviation of symptoms (TTAS) 
Study T0821, T0831, T0832 combined. 
Graphical analyses were conducted to investigate any link between a patient’s baloxavir exposure and 
TTAS. 
The patient population for this graphical analysis were the patients from the placebo arms of the phase 
2 study T0821 and the phase 3 studies T0831 and T0832, as well as the baloxavir marboxil-treated 
patients from the same studies that were included in the population PK analysis.  
Based on the individual estimated AUCinf values, patients in baloxavir marboxil arms were classified 
into two exposure categories (low and high), defined by the median of the estimated AUCinf 
distribution.  
Survival analysis with Kaplan Meier estimation and log-rank tests were then used to compare the TTAS 
over the two exposure categories and the placebo group. For all comparisons, a p value <0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.  
The distribution of the predicted AUCinf across the three studies is given in Table 6, showing a 
tendency of lower exposure in the phase 2 0821 study, which is as expected because lower doses of 
bxm (10 mg and 20 mg) were included in this phase 2 dose-finding study compared with the phase 3 
studies that used either 40 mg or 80 mg depending on the patient’s body weight. 
Table 6 Observed distribution of Baloxavir exposure (from computed AUC0_INF (μg.hr/mL)) 
across studies T0821, T0831 and T0832 
Bxm-treated patients in the database were split into two groups of exposure: those with AUC0_inf 
included in the minimum to median range of AUC0_inf ([0.722 – 5.13) μg.hr/mL, defining the low 
exposure group) and those with AUC0_inf included in the median to the maximum range of AUC0_inf 
([5.13 -16.7] μg.hr/mL, defining the high exposure group). 
Figure 6 illustrates the observed TTAS Kaplan Meier curves in the placebo group and in the baloxavir 
low and high exposure groups. Figure 7 also illustrates the observed TTAS Kaplan Meier curves but 
only for patients with a composite symptom score at baseline ≥ 13, the observed median composite 
symptom score in the database. The TTAS Kaplan Meier curves for patients less severely affected, 
defined as patients with a composite symptom score at baseline lower than 13, is shown in the 
Appendix 1 Figure 8 below.

Bridging between PEP Japanese subjects and non-Asians 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 55/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The PEP study was designed to evaluate if a single dose of baloxavir (40 mg or 80 mg in adults) would 
decrease the risk of getting influenza among subjects living together with household members 
suffering from influenza. Based on population PK models for adults/adolescents and children, it was 
predicted that the same dosage regimen as used for treatment could maintain the plasma baloxavir 
concentrations for about 10 days.   
As study T0834 was conducted in Japan, an exposure matching approach is used to bridge the T0834 
PEP data obtained in Japanese subjects to non-Asian subjects ≥12 years of age. This bridging approach 
consists of 3 steps: 
1.  Confirm the expectation that baloxavir exposures observed in Japanese subjects in the PEP study 
are similar to those in Asian patients in the OwH and HR treatment studies; 
2.  Assess the relationship between baloxavir concentration and key PEP clinical endpoints for all 
subjects in study T0834; 
3.  Compare baloxavir exposures in PEP Japanese subjects to those of non-Asian patients ≥12 years 
of age in the OwH and HR treatment studies, with the aim of assessing whether prophylactic 
efficacy can be bridged to non-Asian patients, who are known to have lower exposures to 
baloxavir than Asian patients. 
The study demonstrated (1) a similar exposure-response relationship between paediatric Japanese 
subjects (<12 years of age) and Japanese subjects ≥12 years of age, and (2) a similar baloxavir 
exposure between paediatric Japanese subjects and non-Asian OwH and HR subjects ≥12 years of age. 
Therefore, the Applicant concludes that an exposure-response difference between Asian subjects 
≥12 years of age and non-Asian subjects ≥12 years of age would not be expected, even though adult 
Asian patients tend to have slightly higher baloxavir exposure than non-Asian adults.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of bxm/baloxavir has been studied in healthy subjects, in special populations, 
and in patients with influenza being either at high risk of influenza complications (HR population) or 
otherwise healthy (OwH population). Data from both Asian and non-Asian subjects were obtained. The 
PK data were analysed in individual studies and were used to build a population PK model based on 
data from the phase 1, 2, and 3 studies. Individual Bayesian post-hoc baloxavir PK parameters were 
derived from the population PK model. The model is considered valid and suitable for the intended 
purposes. 
The dosing regimen in the clinical studies was based on body weight since it was demonstrated early in 
the development programme that weight and race were predictors of exposure and that the average 
overall exposure was higher in Asians than in non-Asians. This difference in exposure is most likely a 
result of differences in absolute bioavailability, which do not seem to be caused by ethnicity related 
genetic polymorphism in the hydrolysing enzyme (AADAC). The weight-based dosing was introduced to 
reduce the differences in exposure. According to the weight-based dosing regimen, subjects ≥ 80kg 
was to receive a single dose of 80 mg bxm and subjects <80 kg a single dose of 40 mg bxm. The 
posology in children was also a single dose according to weight: <10 kg: 1 mg/kg, weight 10-<20 kg: 
10 mg, weight 20-<40 kg: 20 mg, and weight ≥40 kg: 40 mg.  
With regard to age, the available data from 1602T0832 suggest that exposures are broadly comparable 
between subjects with influenza who are <65 years, 65-74 or 75+ years. 47 patients aged 75+ years 
received baloxavir, including one 85-year-old Asian patient.  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 56/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The PK of baloxavir was best described using a three-compartment model with first-order elimination 
and absorption processes and a lag time. After introducing a weight-adjusted dosing, the overall 
difference in exposure was reduced from 45-50% to around 30%. Bxm has been administered to four 
adult patients weighing < 40 kg and their estimated AUC values were within the range seen in the 
T0831 OwH phase 3 study.  
Baloxavir human serum protein-binding ranged from 92.9% to 93.9% in vitro. The unbound fraction 
was apparently similar across species. Based on the observed data in the hepatic impairment study 
and the applicant’s calculations, an important effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the free fraction 
of baloxavir and accordingly efficacy is unlikely.  
Data suggest that baloxavir is subject to biliary secretion and is primarily excreted via faeces. 
Baloxavir is only sparsely excreted in the urine (3.3%). The half-life of baloxavir is estimated to be 
79.1 hours. No dose adjustment would be needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment. The safety and efficacy of Xofluza has not been established in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment.  
In plasma, baloxavir was the main entity accounting for 82.2% of total radioactivity. Other metabolites 
were baloxavir glucuronide and baloxavir sulfoxide, accounting for 16.4% and 1.5% of total 
radioactivity in plasma, respectively.  
In the large phase II/III studies, the effect of food was minimal and since the efficacy was not affected 
by concomitant food intake, the product may be taken with or without food.   
The in vitro-based steady-state DDI assessments as well as the lack of interaction with rosuvastatin 
support that baloxavir is not a relevant in vivo inhibitor of OATP1B1, OCT1, MATE-1 and MATE2-K.  
The primary exposure-response endpoint was time to alleviation of symptoms (TTAS) and virus titre 
was used as a PD endpoint.  
In the dose finding study (T0821), the primary endpoint, time to alleviation of symptoms (TTAS), was 
numerically lower but not statistically lower in patients treated with bxm compared with placebo. 
However, a decrease in virus titre was observed.  
The combined analysis of study T0821, T0831, and T0832 showed that TTAS were lower for subjects 
with high baloxavir exposure in terms of AUC0-inf compared with low exposure, although the difference 
between the two exposure groups was small. In patients with symptom score ≥ 13, the difference in 
TTAS was larger between the exposure groups than in patients with symptom score <13.  
In the PEP population, no differences in plasma concentrations were observed between those who met 
the primary (influenza-infected with fever AND at least one respiratory symptom) or secondary 
endpoints (influenza-infected with fever OR at least one respiratory symptom) and those who did not. 
Therefore, no exposure-response relationship was observed in the PEP population. 
The dedicated QTc study did not show prolongation of the QTc.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme conducted was comprehensive and adequate in terms of number 
of enrolled subjects and type of studies performed. The overall conclusion is that the proposed dosing 
regimen for Asian and non-Asian adolescents and adults is considered appropriate for both the treatment 
and the PEP indications.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Baloxavir marboxil is proposed for treatment of influenza infection and for post-exposure prophylaxis. 
The efficacy evaluation is divided in two parts; first, the efficacy of baloxavir marboxil as a treatment 
of influenza infection is evaluated, second, the efficacy of baloxavir marboxil as post-exposure 
prophylaxis is evaluated separately. 
2.5.1.  Clinical efficacy in the treatment indication 
The treatment indication sought for baloxavir marboxil is: 
• 
treatment of influenza in patients aged 12 and above, including patients at high risk of 
developing influenza-related complications 
A total of 18 clinical studies of baloxavir marboxil have been conducted, including:  
• 
1 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, pivotal, Phase 2 study on the treatment of 
diagnosed influenza in otherwise healthy subjects (T0821).  
• 
2 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and comparator controlled, pivotal, Phase 3 
studies on the treatment of diagnosed influenza in otherwise healthy subjects (T0831) and in patients 
at high-risk of developing complications (T0832). 
In total, 1442 subjects received the proposed 40-80 mg dose (dependent on weight below or above 80 
kgs) in the dosage form intended for commercial use as a treatment of influenza infection. 
2.5.1.1. 
Dose response study 
One dose-response study was conducted in Japan, study T0821, in otherwise healthy (OwH) patients.  
An overview of the study design is provided in the figure below. Adult patients (20 to 64 years of age) 
were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 to receive 10, 20, or 40 mg of baloxavir marboxil, or 
placebo. The study planned to randomize 400 patients in order to detect a significant difference 
between at least one dose group and the placebo group. The actual number of patients randomized 
was 400 patients.

Figure 9 Overview of OwH Study T0821 Design  
If influenza symptoms were so severe that the patient needed rescue therapy between Visits 1 and 7, 
the use of acetaminophen at a dose of 1500 mg/day or less was permitted only for the relief of fever 
or pain. The use of antiviral, antimicrobial, antifungal, antipyretic/analgesic (except provided

Main studies 
The efficacy of treatment of influenza was evaluated in two pivotal studies conducted in an otherwise 
healthy (OwH) population, study T0831, and in a high risk (HR) population, study T0832.

Treatments 
OwH 
Adult patients (20 to 64 years of age) were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive baloxavir marboxil 
(single dose on Day 1), placebo, or oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily [BID] for 5 days). Adolescent 
patients (12 to 19 years of age) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either baloxavir marboxil or 
placebo. Baloxavir marboxil dosing was based on the patient’s body weight at screening: patients who 
weighed 40 to < 80 kg received 40 mg and patients who weighed ≥ 80 kg received 80 mg. Oseltamivir 
was not administered to patients <20 years of age due to a labelling restriction on its use in OwH 
adolescents in Japan at the time of the study (the restriction was lifted in August 2018 after the study 
was complete). In each age group, patients were also stratified by the following three factors: region 
(Japan/Asia or Rest of the World), body weight (< 80 kg or ≥ 80 kg), and composite influenza 
symptom score at baseline (≤ 11 or ≥ 12). As rescue therapy between Visits 1 and 7, the use of 
acetaminophen at a dose of 3000 mg/day or less was permitted only for the relief of fever or pain. 
The study in otherwise healthy subjects is depicted below.

HR 
Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil, 
repeated doses of oseltamivir (75 mg BID for 5 days), or placebo. Baloxavir marboxil dosing was based 
on the patient’s body weight at screening: patients who weighed 40 to < 80 kg received 40 mg and 
patients who weighed ≥ 80 kg received 80 mg. Patients were also stratified by the following four 
factors: baseline symptom score (≤ 14 or ≥ 15), pre-existing and worsened symptoms (yes or no), 
region (Asia, North America/Europe, or Southern Hemisphere), and body weight (< 80 kg or ≥ 80 kg). 
As rescue therapy between Visits 1 and 7, the use of acetaminophen at a dose of 3000 mg/day or less 
was permitted only for the relief of fever or pain.

Objectives 
The study objectives of the studies T0831 and T0832 were to evaluate the efficacy of a single, oral 
dose of baloxavir marboxil compared with placebo and oseltamivir by measuring the time to alleviation 
or improvement of symptoms in otherwise healthy patients (T0831) and patients, who were assessed 
as having a higher risk of developing influenza-related complications (T0832). 
The studies aimed at showing superiority of baloxavir marboxil as compared to placebo and 
subsequently to show non-inferiority to oseltamivir.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both the OwH and HR populations was time to recovery from the 
influenza infection. In the OwH population, the recovery was evaluated as time to alleviation of 
symptoms, TTAS, while it in the HR population was evaluated as time to improvement of symptoms, 
TTIS. The TTIS is a modification of the TTAS to encompass that some patients had ‘influenza-like 
symptoms’ at baseline, e.g. COPD patients with cough and fatigue.  
Alleviation of symptoms, TTAS, was defined as the time when all 7 influenza symptoms (cough, sore 
throat, headache, nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) had been 
assessed by the patient as 0 (none) or 1 (mild) for a duration of at least 21.5 hours (24 hours minus 
10%). 
Improvement of symptoms, TTIS, was defined as follows: 
•  Alleviation of new symptoms that were not present before the onset of influenza: the symptom 
score must have been assessed by the patient as 0 (none) or 1 (mild) on the 4-point scale  
• 
Improvement of pre-existing symptoms that were judged by the patient to have been 
worsened by influenza: the symptom score must have improved by at least 1 point from 
baseline severity. 
•  Maintenance of pre-existing symptoms that were judged by the patient to have NOT been 
worsened by influenza: the symptom score must have at least stayed the same as at baseline. 
Assessments both in OwH and the HR group were made by the patients in an eDiary pre-dose on Day 
1, twice daily (morning and evening) until Day 9, and once daily (evening) from Days 10 to 14. 
Secondary endpoints 
The Applicant included several secondary endpoints, please refer to the tables below (first OwH, then 
HR). The secondary endpoints were not prioritised and the analyses of the secondary endpoints did not 
include correction for multiplicity.

Other endpoints 
The OwH studies and the HR-study had two other endpoints in common, namely drug susceptibility at 
baseline and treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in the PA, PB1, and PB2 genes. 
Drug susceptibility at baseline 
Virus in nasopharyngeal/pharyngeal swabs collected at baseline was propagated in cell cultures to 
obtain sufficient quantity for phenotypic analysis. Drug susceptibility was evaluated as follows: 
• 
For baloxavir, the 50% effective concentration (EC50) was determined by plaque assay (OwH 
Phase 2 Study T0821) or Virospot assay (Phase 3 studies T0831 [OwH] and T0832 [HR]) and 
compared with that of the reference strains (A/Victoria/361/2011 for type A virus and 
B/Wisconsin/1/2010 for type B virus). The EC50 was defined as the baloxavir concentration 
required to decrease the number of plaques or immunostained spots formed by viral infection 
in cell cultures by 50%. 
• 
For oseltamivir acid, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined by NA-star® 
assay and compared with that of the reference strains (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 for type A virus and 
B/Lee/40 for type B virus). The IC50 was defined as the oseltamivir acid concentration required 
to inhibit neuraminidase activity by 50%.   
Treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions 
To investigate treatment-emergent amino acid substitution in the PA gene after dosing with baloxavir 
marboxil in the OwH and HR studies, genotypic testing was performed directly on viral RNA isolated 
from patients who had paired nasopharyngeal/ pharyngeal swab samples at baseline (pre-dose Day 1) 
and after dosing (last time point based on positive RT-PCR result). No intermediate virus propagation 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 68/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
step was performed in order to avoid introduction of new mutations. In the Phase 3 studies, viral RNA 
was also isolated for genotypic testing from patients who received placebo. Treatment-emergent amino 
acid substitution was defined as an amino acid change occurring in the period between baseline (pre-
dose Day 1) and the last time point with a positive RT-PCR result.  
In the OwH studies only, extensive sequencing of the PB1 and PB2 genes was performed on samples 
from selected baloxavir marboxil-treated patients: 
• 
• 
T0831 - patients identified as non-responders (based on the criteria in Table 3) who did not 
exhibit a treatment-emergent change at position 38 in the PA gene. 
T0821 - patients infected with A/H1N1pdm virus who showed evidence of virus titer rebound 
after Day 6. Patients were identified on a case-by-case basis. 
Randomisation/ Blinding (masking) 
Please refer to the description of the studies; randomisation and blinding are addressed in the 
‘Treatment’ section 
Statistical methods 
Intention to treat population 
Efficacy was evaluated with the intention-to-treat infected analysis set, ITTI, consisting of randomised, 
treated patients with confirmed influenza (tested positive on the RT-PCR). Patients not treated or 
tested negative were excluded from the ITTI analysis set.  
The RT-PCR test is taken at visit 1 or before and therefore excluding patients based on the result of the 
test should not be biased. From the point of view that baloxavir marboxil is only effective against 
illnesses caused by influenza virus and influenza is assessed pre-treatment it is plausible to perform 
the analysis on the ITTI to be able to estimate the treatment effect. 
Per-protocol population 
The Per-protocol Set (PPS) population consisted of randomized patients who were included in the ITTI 
population and did not meet any of the following conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Ineligible subjects 
Patients with noncompliance of treatment defined as the patients whose treatment compliance 
rate was less than 60%. 
Patients with inadequate follow-up defined as the patients had no symptom data after the 
initial treatment. 
Patients who had taken any prohibited medications 
Patients with incorrect treatment allocation 
Patients with important protocol deviations (TO832 only)  
Statistical tests 
The analyses for the primary endpoint are controlled at a 5% significance level by hierarchical testing 
of the primary (baloxavir marboxil vs placebo) and secondary analysis (baloxavir marboxil vs 
oseltamivir) which is endorsed. Secondary endpoints are not controlled for multiplicity. 
Primary endpoint 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 69/159 
 
 
  
  
The primary endpoint was analysed using a stratified Peto-Prentice generalised Wilcoxon model 
stratified by baseline composite symptom score, region and pre-existing and worsened symptom 
(T0832 only). Patients’ not experiencing alleviation/ improvement of symptoms were censored at last 
observed timepoint. Patients are expected to become alleviated/improved from symptoms during the 
trial in all treatment groups (possible difference in treatment will diminish towards the end of the trial). 
The applicant estimated treatment differences by subtracting the group medians and not by estimating 
differences in medians which for skewed distributions can result in very different results. 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was analysed using the stratified Peto-Prentice’s 
generalized Wilcoxon test with baseline composite symptom score, region and Pre-existing and 
worsened symptom as the stratification factors (for T0832 only) looking into assumptions on analysis 
set (PP analysis set), censoring based on trial discontinuation (time of and reason for withdrawal) and 
primary endpoint definition (excluding cough). In addition, the robustness of analysis method was 
evaluated using a stratified logrank test. 
Changes to the statistical analysis plan 
The statistical analyses plans for trial T0831 and T0832 were both finalised before unblinding and there 
were no changes to the pre-specified analyses. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The participants’ flow in the OwH population: 
A total of 1436 patients were randomized to treatment in Phase 3 OwH Study T0831. Among the 70 
randomized patients who did not complete the study, the most common reason for non-completion in 
all treatment groups was withdrawal of consent (37 patients). Of the 1436 patients randomized, 4 
patients received no study drug.

According to section 9.8.1 of the CSR, based on results of site audits, critical and major deviations 
(GCP noncompliance) were found at three sites and the Sponsor decided to close these sites. However, 
submitted data indicate that the ITTI population eliminated patients enrolled at 7 sites.  Patients from 
all these sites were included in the safety population. 
As a result, the data indicate that 107 patients (32-41 per group) were eliminated from the ITTI 
population due to enrolment at GCP noncompliant sites and this number included 32 (6-14 per group) 
with influenza confirmed by RT-PCR, i.e., who would otherwise have been eligible for the ITTI 
population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
As mentioned in the methods section, the Applicant estimated treatment differences by subtracting the 
group medians and not by estimating differences in medians which for skewed distributions can result 
in very different results. Therefore, the Applicant was asked to provide estimates of the treatment 
differences by applying an estimation method that is concordant with to the primary analysis method 
e.g. Brookmeyer CI. 
Nevertheless, in the evaluation of primary and secondary endpoints below, emphasis is put on whether 
the recorded times to recovery in the baloxavir marboxil group are all in all shorter than in the placebo 
and oseltamivir groups. 
OwH 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was time to alleviation, TTAS. The baloxavir marboxil group is compared first 
with placebo, subsequently with oseltamivir. The results are given below. 
Comparison with placebo:  
The time to alleviation, TTAS, was significantly shorter in the baloxavir marboxil group than in the 
placebo group. This result was reflected by a median time (95% CI) to alleviation in the baloxavir 
marboxil of 54 hours (50-59 h) as compared to 80 hours (73-87 h) in the placebo group.  
The treatment with baloxavir marboxil appeared specifically to influence the period between day 1 and 
5 after treatment initiation. I.e. more patients obtained alleviation of symptoms during day 1-5 in the 
baloxavir marboxil group than in the placebo group. By day 5 (120 hours), an equal proportion of 
patients in the baloxavir marboxil and the placebo group had recovered (above 80% in each group).

Secondary endpoints 
Secondary clinical endpoints included time to alleviation of 4 systemic symptoms (Headache, 
feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue), of 3 respiratory symptoms (Cough, sore 
throat and nasal congestion), or of individual symptoms (feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, 
fatigue, cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion).  
All secondary endpoints are considered exploratory as the Applicant did not prioritise these endpoints 
and as no corrections for multiplicity have been made. The secondary endpoints of the OwH-study are

Ancillary analyses 
In the patients infected with the predominant type A/H3 virus, the analysis of median TTAS was similar 
to that for the total ITTI population, with a significant difference for baloxavir vs. placebo. In the very 
small numbers with type A/H1N1pdm virus, the median TTAS was shorter in the baloxavir group. 
However, in the small numbers of patients infected with type B virus, the median TTAS was longer in 
the baloxavir vs. placebo group. 
The median time to alleviation of the 4 systemic symptoms was 33.8 h with baloxavir vs. 53.5 h for 
placebo and 37.4 h for oseltamivir. The median time to alleviation of the 3 respiratory symptoms was 
46 h with baloxavir vs. 69.1 h for placebo and 44.6 h for oseltamivir. The least squares mean change 
from baseline in the composite symptom score was greater with baloxavir vs. placebo from 24-96 h 
post-dose but there was no obvious difference vs. oseltamivir.

The time to resolution of fever was faster with baloxavir vs. placebo but not vs. oseltamivir. 
Figure 15 Kaplan-Meier Curve: Time to Resolution of Fever (ITTI Population) 
The median time to return to pre-influenza status was 129.2 h for baloxavir vs. 168.8 h for placebo, 
which was not statistically significant (p=0.0563). There was no difference vs. oseltamivir. 
In the ITTI population, 16/456 baloxavir (3.5%) and 10/231 placebo patients (4.3%) experienced 
influenza-related complications. For the comparison with oseltamivir, the rates were 4.0% vs. 2.4%. 
The most frequent event was bronchitis (2.0% vs. 3.5% placebo and 1.6% oseltamivir). 
Baloxavir gave statistically significant reductions in TTAS vs. placebo: 
o 
In the subgroups with baseline composite symptom scores ≤ 11 (19.1 h; p=0.0078) and ≥ 12 
27.0 h; p=<0.0001). 
o 
Regardless of region; actual differences in median TTAS were 31.3 h in Japan/Asia and 30.6 h in 
N. America.

o 
Regardless of body weight/dose category; actual differences in median TTAS of 28.0 h in those < 
80 kg and 18.7 h in those 80+ kg. 
Regardless of the timing of dosing in regard to food; actual differences in medians fell within the 
range 26.7 h and 29.1 h.  
Regardless of the time elapsed from onset of symptomatic influenza to start of treatment. 
However, the difference in median TTAS was 32.8 h when treatment started within 24 h compared 
to only 13.2 h when treatment started between 24 and 48 h.  
In adolescents and adults; the actual difference in median TTAS was greater in the adolescents vs. 
adults (38.6 h vs. 25.6 h).  
For all the above, there were no important differences between baloxavir and oseltamivir. 
The proportions with positive influenza virus titres (log10 TCID50/mL) were statistically significantly 
lower in the baloxavir vs. placebo group from Days 2 through 5. In parallel with this finding, 
statistically significant differences in proportions with positive influenza virus titres (log10 TCID50/mL) 
favouring baloxavir vs. oseltamivir occurred on Days 2, 3 and 5. Similar results vs. placebo and vs. 
oseltamivir were obtained in the predominant sub-group infected with type A/H3 virus. In patients 
infected with type B virus, the proportions with positive titres were lower in the baloxavir vs. placebo 
group but the differences from Days 2 through 5 were not statistically significant.  
The virus titre was reduced more rapidly in the baloxavir group vs. the placebo group and the mean 
change from baseline was significantly greater in the baloxavir group from Days 2 through 5.

Compared with the oseltamivir group, the reduction in titre was more rapid with baloxavir with 
significant differences on Days 2 and 3.

Figure 17 Change from Baseline in Influenza Virus Titer (≥ 20 Years of Age Stratum, ITTI 
Population ) 
Results in the sub-group with type A/H3 virus were similar to those in the ITT population. In the 
subgroup with type B virus, the mean change from baseline in titre was greater for baloxavir vs. 
placebo and vs. oseltamivir on Days 2 and 3 but not after that.  
The median time to cessation of viral shedding determined by virus titre was 24 h for baloxavir vs. 96 
h for placebo (p=<0.0001) and 72 h for oseltamivir (p=<0.0001). The same overall pattern was seen 
for those with type A/H3 virus. In the patients infected with type B virus or with A/H1N1pdm virus, 
there was a significant difference in time to cessation of shedding for baloxavir vs. placebo and a 
numerical difference vs. oseltamivir.  
Based on the RT-PCR (log10 virus particles/mL), there were high rates and little difference between 
baloxavir vs. placebo groups for the proportions positive for influenza until Day 5 or later.  
However, the mean change from baseline in amount of viral RNA was statistically significantly greater 
in the baloxavir vs. placebo group from Days 2 through 9. In the comparison with oseltamivir, the 
mean change from baseline was statistically significantly greater in the baloxavir group on Days 2, 3 
and 5. The same overall pattern was seen for those with type A/H3 virus. In the subgroup with type B 
virus, the mean change from baseline from Days 2 through 9 was slightly lower for baloxavir vs. 
placebo. When determined by RT-PCR, time to cessation of shedding was 216 h with baloxavir vs. 240 
h with placebo and with oseltamivir, both comparisons reaching statistical significance. 
Due to findings in the other Phase 3 treatment study (1602T0832; see below) that arose during a site 
audit for Study Centre 811, including critical and major deviations, the sponsor (Shionogi) decided to 
close this site. At time of closure, 10 patients had been enrolled into 1601T0831. At FDA’s request, 
additional efficacy analyses of TTAS and time to cessation of viral shedding by virus titre were 
conducted after omitting data from Centre 811. These additional results are provided in the CSR; 
however, removal of the 10 patients did not impact on any study conclusions. For example, in the 
primary analysis, the difference in median TTAS between baloxavir and placebo was -26.4 h 
(p<0.0001).

Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was time to improvement, TTIS.  
In the high-risk population, the time to improvement of symptoms was significantly shorter in the 
baloxavir marboxil group than in the placebo group, thus, the primary endpoint of the study was met. 
This was reflected by a shorter median time (95% CI) to improvement in the baloxavir marboxil, 73 
hours (67-85 hours), as compared to the placebo group, 102 hours (93-113 hours). From day 1 
through day 9, the proportion of patients, whose symptoms had improved, was higher in the baloxavir 
marboxil group as compared to placebo. Thus, in this high-risk population the difference between the 
groups was sustained throughout the study.

Ancillary analyses 
Baloxavir significantly shorted the median TTAS vs. placebo but there was no statistically significant 
difference vs. oseltamivir.  
Table 23 Time to Alleviation of Symptoms (ITTI Population) 
The TTIS by viral type indicated that the results for baloxavir vs. placebo in subgroups with A/H3 and B 
were very similar to those of the primary analysis. Whilst there was no difference vs. oseltamivir for 
A/H3, baloxavir gave a statistically significantly shorter TTIS vs. oseltamivir in those with type B, 
reflecting a longer median TTIS for oseltamivir against type B compared to type A/H3. Results for 
baloxavir and oseltamivir were similar in the small numbers with A/H1N1pdm and both gave much 
shorter median TTIS values vs. placebo. 
The proportion of patients whose influenza symptoms improved was statistically significantly higher for 
baloxavir vs. placebo from 36-168 h post-dose but the difference narrowed over time, such that rates 
at 168 h were 80.1% in the baloxavir group vs. 72.7% in the placebo group (p = 0.0209). There were 
no statistically significant differences over time between baloxavir and oseltamivir. 
There were statistically significant reductions in the time to improvement of the 4 systemic symptoms 
and 3 respiratory symptoms for baloxavir vs. placebo but no differences vs. oseltamivir.  
The time to resolution of fever was shorter for baloxavir vs. placebo with no difference vs. oseltamivir.

had influenza-related complications.

Page 89/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Table 24 Incidences of Influenza-related Complications (ITTI Population) 
This overall difference for baloxavir vs. placebo in rates of complications was driven by rates for 
sinusitis (0.3% vs. 2.1%) and bronchitis (1.8% vs. 6.0%), with no important differences in rates of 
death, hospitalisation, otitis media or pneumonia. In the oseltamivir group 4.6% had complications 
with no statistically significant difference vs. baloxavir. The median time to return to pre-influenza 
status was not statistically significantly different between treatment groups although there was a 
numerical reduction for baloxavir vs. placebo of 23.4 h and medians were the same for baloxavir and 
oseltamivir. 
Baloxavir gave statistically significant reductions in TTIS vs. placebo:

patients who were treated within > 36 to 48 h 
There were no significant differences for baloxavir vs. oseltamivir in these subgroups. 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020

In the small subgroup aged < 18 years the oseltamivir group showed a reduction in median TTIS with 
no difference between baloxavir and placebo. The overall study results were driven by the large age 
group of adults aged <65 years. In the subgroup aged 65 to 74 years the median TTIS was similar 
among the 3 treatment groups but in those 75+ years there was a statistically significant difference for 
baloxavir vs. placebo and a comparable reduction in TTIS with baloxavir and oseltamivir. 
The median time to cessation of viral shedding determined by virus titre (log10 TCID50/mL) was 48.0 h 
for baloxavir vs. 96.0 h for both placebo and oseltamivir group. Similar results were observed in the 
supplemental analysis including PCR positive patients enrolled at Sites 206 and 225. 
Figure 19 Kaplan-Meier Curve: Time to Cessation of Viral Shedding by Virus Titer (ITTI 
Population) 
The median time to cessation of viral shedding determined by virus titre was statistically significantly 
shorter for baloxavir vs. placebo and vs. oseltamivir in the subgroups with A/H3 or B virus. However, 
within the baloxavir group the median time to cessation of viral shedding was longer for type B virus 
(72.0 h) than for type A/H3 virus (24.0 h). 
The difference between baloxavir vs. placebo for median time to cessation of viral shedding determined 
by virus titre was statistically significant in subgroups with asthma or chronic lung disease, endocrine 
or metabolic disorders, heart disease, aged ≥ 65 years and with morbid obesity. There were also 
statistically significant differences for baloxavir vs. oseltamivir except in those with metabolic 
disorders. 
The proportion of patients with positive influenza virus titres was statistically significantly lower in the 
baloxavir vs. placebo group from Days 2-6 and vs. oseltamivir from Days 2-4. In those with A/H3, 
statistically significant differences were seen for baloxavir vs. placebo on Days 2-5 and vs. oseltamivir 
on Days 2-3. In those with type B virus, statistically significant differences were seen for baloxavir vs. 
placebo on Days 2-4 and 6 and vs. oseltamivir on Days 2-4. 
The mean change from baseline in the influenza virus titre was statistically significantly greater for 
baloxavir vs. placebo and vs. oseltamivir on Days 2-3. Similar findings applied in subgroups with A/H3 
or type B virus. There were statistically significant differences in the mean AUC titre adjusted by 
baseline for baloxavir vs. placebo but not vs. oseltamivir. 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 91/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on RT-PCR, the median time to cessation of viral shedding determined by RT-PCR was 
statistically significantly shorter for baloxavir vs. placebo but not vs. oseltamivir. Similar findings 
applied in those with A/H3 but the time to cessation of viral shedding was 240 h in each group for 
those with type B. The difference for baloxavir vs. placebo was also statistically significant for 
those with heart disease, aged ≥ 65 years or with morbid obesity but not in other subgroups and there 
were no differences vs. oseltamivir. 
The proportion of patients with positive influenza virus RNA determined by RT-PCR was lower in the 
baloxavir vs. placebo group on Days 2 through 6 and Day 9, but the differences were statistically 
significant only on Day 9 (p = 0.0017). The differences in the proportion of patients with positive 
influenza virus RNA were very similar between the baloxavir and oseltamivir groups at each time point 
and were not statistically significant at any time point. 
The GM ratios of influenza antibody titres were not different between the baloxavir, oseltamivir or 
placebo groups. 
Gene substitutions during treatment 
In the OwH and HR clinical studies, treatment-emergent PA/I38T substitution and additional I38 amino 
acid substitutions (PA/I38M, PA/I38F, and PA/I38N), collectively referred to as PA/I38X, were 
observed, and reverse genetic analysis demonstrated that these substitutions were associated with 
reduced baloxavir susceptibility. 
In all three studies, the position in the PA gene most frequently affected by treatment-emergent amino 
acid substitutions was position 38. Overall, in patients treated with baloxavir marboxil, treatment-
emergent amino acid changes at position 38 of the PA gene were detected in virus collected from 
36/370 (9.7%) patients in OwH Phase 3 Study T0831, 4/182 (2.2%) patients in OwH Phase 2 Study 
T0821, and 15/290 (5.2%) patients in HR Phase 3 Study T0832; the denominators include baloxavir 
marboxil-treated patients with evaluable paired sequence samples collected at baseline and at the last 
time point with a positive RT-PCR result. No amino acid substitutions were found at position 38 in virus 
collected from placebo-treated patients.  
In OwH studies T0831 and T0821, treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in the PA gene 
exhibiting reduced susceptibility to baloxavir in recombinant strains were PA/I38T (A/H3N2 [fold 
change 48.90 - 56.59], A/H1N1 [fold change 27.24], B [fold change 5.76]), PA/I38F (A/H1N1 [fold 
change 10.61]), and PA/I38M (A/H3N2 [fold change 13.77]). In HR Study T0832, treatment-emergent 
amino acid substitutions in the PA gene exhibiting reduced susceptibility to baloxavir in recombinant 
strains were PA/I38T (A/H3N2 [fold change 20.33], B), PA/I38M (A/H3N2), and PA/I38N (A/H1N1 [fold 
change 3.66]). For all other treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions detected in these clinical 
studies, including all non-I38 substitutions, the fold change was <10 for type A virus and <5 for type B 
virus. Thus, overall, treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in the PA gene exhibiting reduced 
susceptibility to baloxavir in the OwH and HR studies were PA/I38T, F, M, and N. 
Clinical Impact of PA/I38 Substitutions 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 92/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
To assess the potential clinical impact of PA/I38X substitutions, primary efficacy endpoints were 
analysed for patients with and without I38 substitutions from OwH Phase 3 Study T0831 and HR Phase 
3 Study T0832. 
In between 2 and 10 % of the influenza infected OwH or HR patients, who were treated with baloxavir 
marboxil, changes in the viral PA gene were observed. No changes to the PA gene were found in the 
patients, who received placebo, or patients exposed to oseltamivir. Similarly, changes in the PB1 and 
PB2 genes were observed in a smaller number of virus samples from patients treated with baloxavir 
marboxil in the OwH-studies (data not shown)

Primary Analysis 
Intention-to-treat infected population (ITTI) 
Efficacy was assessed over 14 days 
The ITTI population consisted of the patients who received the study drug 
with a confirmed diagnosis of influenza. Confirmation of influenza was 
based on the results of RT-PCR on Day 1. The population was analyzed 
according to the treatment to which the patients were randomized.

of the world).  
The primary (baloxavir marboxil vs placebo) and secondary (baloxavir 
marboxil vs oseltamivir) comparisons were conducted in a hierarchical 
manner so as to maintain control of overall Type I error.

Summary of Efficacy for Trial 1602T0832 
Title: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind Study of a Single Dose of S-033188 Compared with 
Placebo or Oseltamivir 75 mg Twice Daily for 5 Days in Patients with Influenza at High Risk of Influenza 
Complications 
Study identifier 
1602T0832 (T0832), CV40818, EudraCT 2016-002688-32, CAPSTONE-2 
Design 
A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-, and active-controlled 
study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of baloxavir 
marboxil (S-033188) (40 or 80 mg depending on patient’s body weight and 
administered within 48 hours of symptom onset) in patients ≥ 12 years of age with 
influenza A and/or B infection at high risk of developing influenza complications. 
Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single, weight-based oral 
dose of baloxavir marboxil, oseltamivir (75 mg BID for 5 days), or placebo. There was a 
maximum of 9 visits, including 2 optional visits, during a 22-day period to assess the 
efficacy and safety.

Time to improvement of influenza symptoms, 
defined as the time from the start of study 
treatment to the improvement of influenza 
symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal 
congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint 
pain, and fatigue). 
 The improvement of influenza symptoms was 
defined as the time when all of a patient’s 
influenza symptoms had been alleviated, 
maintained, or improved for a duration of at least 
21.5 hours (24 hours − 10%) as follows: 
• Preexisting symptoms that were judged by the 
patient to be worse at baseline must have 
improved at least 1 score from baseline 
severity  
• Preexisting symptoms that were judged by the 
patient to NOT be worse at baseline must have 
maintained baseline severity  
• For new symptoms at baseline, alleviation, 
which meant the symptom score was none or 
mild, of symptoms must have been achieved  
 Time to alleviation of symptoms (cough, sore 
throat, headache, nasal congestion, feverishness 
or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue), 
defined as the time between the initiation of the 
study treatment and the alleviation of influenza 
symptoms, defined as the time when all 7 
influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat,

Notes 
The stratification factors used in the analyses were: region (Asia, North 
America/Europe, Southern Hemisphere), composite symptom scores at baseline (≤ 14 
or ≥ 15) and preexisting and worsened symptoms (yes or no).  
The primary endpoint was first compared between the baloxavir marboxil and placebo 
groups (primary analysis). Together with the primary efficacy analysis, the comparison 
between the baloxavir marboxil and the oseltamivir groups (secondary analysis) was 
conducted. The secondary analysis was only performed if a statistically significant 
difference was observed in the primary analysis, in order to maintain control of overall 
type I error.  
During the study it was determined that two siteswould be closed due to GCP 
noncompliance and all patients were excluded from the ITTI population. Therefore, a 
supplemental analysis of the ITTI population including PCR positive patients enrolled 
at the two closed sites was performed. The median time to improvement of symptoms 
was significantly reduced in the baloxavir marboxil group (73.0 hours) compared with 
the placebo group (102.4 hours) (generalized Wilcoxon test, p-value < 0.0001; log-
rank test p-value = 0.0003). There was no significant difference in the median time to 
improvement of symptoms between the baloxavir marboxil group and the oseltamivir 
(generalized Wilcoxon test, p-value = 0.6784; log-rank test p-value = 0.7136).

Clinical studies in special populations 
The Applicant has not presented studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Paediatric studies 
with regard to treatment of influenza have not been presented either. In the high-risk group, the 
median age was 55 years, 53 years, and 53 years in the baloxavir marboxil, placebo, and oseltamivir 
groups, respectively. There were 29%, 27% and 27% patients aged ≥ 65 years in the three groups. As 
age ≥ 65 years is a high-risk factor, the results in elderly are not presented separately.  
Supportive study 
The phase II dose-finding study, T0821, in otherwise healthy patients supports the phase III studies. A 
summary of numbers analysed and the time to alleviation in the T0821 study is presented below. The 
shorter time to alleviation in the baloxavir marboxil group as compared to placebo was confirmed.

Baloxavir marboxil 20-mg tablets, granules, or matching placebo were orally administered to subjects 
as a single dose on Day 1 (see Table 9-1). Subjects were randomised 1:1 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 109/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 28 Study Drug Administration by Treatment Group 
The use of antipyretics/analgesics, anti-influenza drugs, systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive 
agents, influenza vaccines and other study drugs including over-the-counter drugs with equivalent 
efficacy was prohibited from the time of informed consent until completion of assessments on Day 11. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of study T0834 was: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil compared with placebo in 
the prevention of influenza virus infection in subjects who were household members 
(hereinafter referred to as “subjects”) of influenza-infected patients (hereinafter referred to as 
“index patients”). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who were 
infected with influenza virus (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] 
positive), and presented with fever and at least one respiratory symptom in the period from 
Day 1 to Day 10. 
The secondary objectives of study T0834 were: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil compared with placebo in 
the prevention of influenza virus infection by measuring the secondary endpoints in subjects. 
To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the active form of baloxavir marboxil, ie, baloxavir 
in subjects treated with baloxavir marboxil for prophylaxis. 
To evaluate the safety of a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil for prophylaxis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Using an electronic thermometer, axillary temperature was measured twice daily and recorded in the 
subject diary (ePRO system) from pre-dose on Day 1 until Day 10. Subjects aged ≥ 12 years self-
assessed the 7 symptoms associated with influenza on a 4-point rating scale. For subjects aged < 12 
years, the subject’s guardian assessed 2 symptoms (cough, nasal discharge/nasal congestion) on the 
same 4-point rating scale. Assessments were performed twice daily from pre-dose Day 1 until Day 10. 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 110/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Nasopharyngeal swabs from subjects were collected by trained staff pre-dose on Day 1, Day 5, at a 
subject’s visit between Day 1 (post-dose) and Day 10 (if influenza suspected based on temperature ≥ 
37.5°C and moderate or severe influenza-like symptoms) and Day 11. A central virology testing 
laboratory performed RT-PCR for virus typing and serology. Gene sequencing of virus was performed 
using the first positive sample from a subject. 
Primary Endpoint: 
Proportion of subjects who are infected with influenza virus (RT-PCR positive), and present with fever 
and at least one respiratory symptom in the period from Day 1 to Day 10. 
– Defined as the proportion of subjects having body temperature (axillary) ≥ 37.5°C, having symptom 
of “cough” or “nasal discharge/nasal congestion” with a severity of “2, Moderate” or “3, Severe” 
assessed in the subject diary, and influenza virus positive assessed by RT-PCR. 
Secondary endpoints (not prioritised): 
1) Time from study treatment to the time when fever, at least one respiratory symptom, and influenza 
virus infection were observed. 
2) Proportion of subjects who are infected with influenza virus (RT-PCR positive), and present with 
fever or at least one influenza symptom (respiratory symptom or systemic symptom) in the period 
from Day 1 to Day 10. 
3) Time from study treatment to the time when fever or at least one influenza symptom (respiratory 
symptom or systemic symptom), and influenza virus infection are observed. 
4) Proportion of asymptomatic influenza-infected (RT-PCR positive) subjects in the period from Day 1 
to Day 10  
5) Proportion of subjects with influenza virus infection in the period from Day 1 to Day 10 
Subgroups: 
• 
• 
Time from onset of influenza virus infection of index patient to informed consent of subject (< 
24 hours or ≥ 24 hours) 
Treatment for influenza virus infection of index patient (baloxavir marboxil or other than 
baloxavir marboxil)

Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Subjects who were qualified for entry in the study were randomly assigned to either the baloxavir 
marboxil group or the placebo group in a 1:1 ratio, using the IWRS. The randomization used the 
stochastic minimization method for balancing the following 3 factors.  
• 
• 
Time from onset of influenza virus infection of index patient to informed consent of the subject 
(<24 hours vs. ≥24 hours) 
Treatment for influenza virus infection of index patient (baloxavir marboxil, other than 
baloxavir marboxil) 
•  Subject’s age (<12 years vs. ≥12 years) 
The study was conducted in a double-blind fashion by using matching indistinguishable placebo in 
appearance, labelling, and packaging. 
Statistical methods 
All statistical tests were to be performed at the two-sided significance level of 0.05, unless otherwise 
noted. No multiplicity adjustments were made in this study. 
The risk ratio in the baloxavir marboxil group vs. the placebo group, its 95% confidence interval (CI), 
and P value was calculated using the modified Poisson regression approach of a binary response 
(whether all of the following were confirmed for a subject or not; occurrence of fever, at least one 
respiratory symptom, and influenza virus infection) on a study treatment for subject with 
randomization factors (time from onset of influenza virus infection of index patient to informed 
consent of subject [< 24 hours or ≥ 24 hours], treatment for influenza virus infection of index patient 
[baloxavir marboxil or other than baloxavir marboxil] and age of subject [continuous variable]) as 
covariates.  
Two-sided P value was calculated for the null hypothesis that the true risk ratio was 1. In the primary 
analysis, the proportion of subjects who were infected with influenza virus (RT-PCR positive), and 
presented with fever and at least one respiratory symptom in the baloxavir marboxil group were 
compared with that in the placebo group. The modified Poisson regression approach used the 
sandwich variance estimator. 
The mITT (modified intent-to-treat) population included all randomized subjects who had post-
baseline efficacy data available (virology testing data assessed by RT-PCR, body temperature or 
influenza symptom score) among household members of index patients. Subjects were analysed 
according to the treatment to which they were randomized. 
The Per-protocol Set (PPS) includes all randomized subjects who were included in the mITT population 
and did not have protocol deviations affecting the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The mITT population was the primary efficacy analysis population. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 752 subjects (375 in the baloxavir marboxil group and 377 in the placebo group) were 
randomized as household members of 545 index patients.

Figure 20 Subject Disposition (All Randomized Subjects) 
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects (>75%) were female and were parents of index patients (71.4% and 67.2%). 
The mean age was ~34 years, only 19% were aged <12 years and only 2-4% were ≥ 65 years. The 
proportions with high risk factors (undefined) were 12-14%. More than 90% were negative for 
influenza virus (93.0% and 90.4%) based on RT-PCR. The majority (~73%) was enrolled within 24 h 
of influenza onset in the index case.

Numbers analysed 
Almost all (>99%) randomised subjects were included in the mITT population.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
In the mITT population, the proportion of subjects with influenza virus infection (RT-PCR positive), 
fever, and at least one respiratory symptom during the period from Day 1 to Day 10 was statistically 
significantly lower in the baloxavir marboxil group than in the placebo group (1.9% vs. 13.6%; 
adjusted risk ratio 0.14 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.30], p < 0.0001). 
When the primary analysis was repeated in the subgroup of subjects who had negative RT-PCR at 
baseline and whose index patients had positive RT-PCR the result was similar to that in the overall 
mITT population. The infection rates were 1.5% (5/344 subjects) in the baloxavir group and 11.6% 
(39/337 subjects) in the placebo group (adjusted risk ratio: 0.13 [95% CI: 0.05, 0.31], p < 0.0001).

Secondary endpoints 
The results of the analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints in the mITT population were generally 
supportive of the primary endpoint results. Beneficial effects of baloxavir marboxil were observed 
compared with placebo for all secondary endpoints except the proportion of subjects with 
asymptomatic influenza virus infection, which was similar in both groups (Table 68). 
Ancillary analyses 
As shown in the figure below, the restricted mean survival time (RMST) from study treatment to the 
time when fever, at least one respiratory symptom and influenza virus infection (RT-PCR positive) were 
observed up to Day 10 in the mITT population was 10.0 days (95% CI: 9.9, 10.0) in the baloxavir 
group and 9.1 days (95% CI: 8.9, 9.4) in the placebo group (difference 0.8 days [95% CI: 0.6, 1.0], p 
< 0.0001). 
The proportions with asymptomatic influenza were similar between the treatment groups, with 7.8% 
(29/374) in the baloxavir group and 7.7% (29/375) in the placebo group (adjusted risk ratio: 1.00 
[95% CI: 0.61, 1.64], p = 0.9917). Also, the proportions who were RT-PCR positive regardless of 
symptoms were 13.1% (49/374) in the baloxavir group and 30.4% (114/375) in the placebo group 
(adjusted risk ratio: 0.43 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.58], p < 0.0001).

Subgroup analyses 
Key subgroup analyses were  
•  Subject age (< 12 or  ≥ 12 years)  
•  HR factors for developing influenza-related complications (present or absent per CDC criteria)   
• 
• 
Index patient influenza virus type (RT-PCR)   
Index patient treatment for influenza virus infection  
When the primary endpoint was analysed according to the treatment given to the index case, rates 
in the baloxavir group were 2.7% when the index case had received baloxavir and 1.2% when they 
were given other treatments. Corresponding rates in the placebo group were 11.1% and 17.2% 
(standardized risk ratio: 1.31 [95% CI: 0.65, 2.64], p = 0.4498). 
When the primary endpoint was analysed separately for the two influenza subtype groups, both 
showed statistically significantly lower case rates for baloxavir (A/H1N1pdm 1.1% vs. 10.6%, p = 
0.0023; A/H3NX 2.8% vs. 17.5%, p < 0.0001) 
The proportion that was infected with influenza virus (RT-PCR positive) and presented with fever 
and at least one respiratory symptom from Day 1 to Day 10 was: 
- 
Lower in the baloxavir group in subjects aged < 12 years (4.2% vs. 15.5%, p = 0.0339) and 
subjects aged 12+ years (1.3% vs 13.2%, p < 0.0001).

Lower in the baloxavir group in subjects with (2.2% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.0435) and without 
(1.8% vs. 13.3%, p < 0.0001) high risk factors 
The results in the other subgroups were similar to the result in the overall mITT population.

Clinical studies in special populations 
The majority of subjects included in study T0834 did not have any risk factors, e.g. only one subjects 
with kidney disorder was included and 11 with liver disorder.  
Most subjects were between 30 and 50 years of age. Paediatric subjects under 12 years of age 
accounted for 19% of subjects in both treatment groups while elderly subjects aged 65 years and older 
accounted for 2.1% and 4.0% of subjects in the baloxavir marboxil and placebo groups, respectively. 
The proportion of subjects under 5 years of age was 3.7% in the baloxavir marboxil group and 5.3% in 
the placebo group. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies- Treatment of influenza infection 
Demonstration of clinical efficacy of baloxavir marboxil in the proposed indication of treatment of 
influenza infection is based on two pivotal studies; study T0831, treatment of influenza infection in 
otherwise healthy patients (OwH), and study T0832, treatment of influenza infection in a group of 
patients at higher risk of influenza complications (HR). A phase II dose-finding study in OwH-patients, 
T0821, is considered supportive. 
The studies T0831 and T0832 were multicentre, randomised, double-blind, controlled, pivotal, Phase 3 
studies comparing baloxavir marboxil to placebo and subsequently to oseltamivir in terms of time to 
alleviation/improvement of symptoms in patients infected with influenza. The objective of the study 
T0831 in otherwise healthy patients was to investigate if baloxavir marboxil decreases the time to 
alleviation of influenza symptoms, which is a generally accepted measure of treatment efficacy in 
influenza studies. In the HR patients, the endpoint was slightly modified being ‘time to improvement of 
symptoms’, since HR patients commonly have ‘influenza-like symptoms’ at baseline (e.g. cough and 
fatigue in COPD patients). The objectives are adequately reflected in the primary endpoints and the 
primary efficacy analysis, the modified endpoint ‘time to improvement of symptoms’ in HR patients is 
discussed further below. Overall these designs are considered acceptable.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the T0831, OwH, study selected a population without any acute 
or chronic concomitant disease whose main medical problem was clinically suspected influenza 
infection. In comparison, the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the T0832, HR, study selected patients 
at increased risk of influenza-related complications. Principally, the selection criteria for high-risk 
patients followed the criteria defined by the Centre for Disease Control, however, not all CDC-listed 
patient groups were eligible, e.g. cancer patients. Moreover, only a single item on the list needed to be 
met for eligibility. Based on these criteria, some patients were eligible for reason(s) expected to have 
only a very minor, if any, impact on their risk of developing complications of influenza. For example, 
any otherwise healthy patient aged 65 years would be eligible as would any patient with diabetes 
regardless of type, duration and degree of control.  
Patients were randomised to receive either baloxavir marboxil, 40 mg or 80 mg (depending on body 
weight below or above 80 kg) once + placebo for four additional days, oseltamivir for five days, or 
matching placebo all five days. Treatment was to be initiated within 48h after influenza onset. Both 
study medications and placebo are adequately described. The choice of oseltamivir as active 
comparator is considered relevant as an approved medicinal product in EU for the sought indication.   
The primary endpoint was the time to alleviation (TTAS) or time to improvement (TTIS) of all seven 
influenza symptoms defined as cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, feverishness or chills, 
muscle/joint pain, and fatigue. Fever was defined as ≥ 38ºC (axillary) in the predose examinations or 
> 4 hours after dosing of antipyretics if they were taken. All patients were to record their symptoms in 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 129/159 
 
 
  
  
a diary pre-dose on Day 1, twice daily (morning and evening) until Day 9, and once daily (evening) 
from Days 10 to 14. It is generally accepted that TTAS is an adequate measure of treatment efficacy of 
influenza and is considered acceptable. However, in HR patients the endpoint was modified as being to 
improvement of influenza symptoms (TTIS), which consisted of three categories: Alleviation of new 
symptoms that were not present before the onset of influenza, Improvement of pre-existing symptoms 
that were judged by the patient to have been worsened by influenza, and/or Maintenance of pre-
existing symptoms that were judged by the patient to have NOT been worsened by influenza.  
As in prior treatment studies that have supported NAI approvals, the primary analysis was conducted 
in the ITTI population, comprising all treated subjects with a positive RT-PCR on day 1. It is acceptable 
that culture confirmation was not required for inclusion in the primary analysis. However, in contrast to 
several prior studies with NAIs, the inclusion criteria did not require that a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) 
conducted at the study site was used to determine study eligibility. The exception was in 1602T0832 in 
which (by amendment) subjects enrolled in the US were to have a positive RDT or a documented 
exposure to a case of influenza to be eligible. As a result, a substantial proportion of the total enrolled 
(~25% in 1601T0831 and near to 50% in 1602T0832) were excluded from the ITTI populations 
Secondary endpoints included clinical and virological endpoints, namely time to 
alleviation/improvement of individual symptoms or number of complications (clinical), and viral 
shedding as assessed by virus titre and virus-PCR. Especially the risk of complications appears clinically 
relevant, since treatment may be initiated specifically to avoid complications in high risk patients. 
However, the Applicant did not prioritise the secondary endpoints or adjust for multiplicity in the 
analyses of significance of treatment for each endpoint. Therefore, the secondary endpoints are 
considered exploratory.  
Whilst the two studies were conducted in different regions (Japan and N. America being common to 
both) and in different seasons, the difference in proportion confirmed to be eligible for the primary 
analysis is not discussed. In this regard, additional central laboratories participated in 1602T0832. The 
applicant confirmed that in-house RT-qPCR tests were used at the central laboratories, and the test 
used did not change between studies. According to the applicant, the possible explanation for the 
difference in the percentage included in the primary analysis, is a result of higher flu confirmation rates 
in Japan than rest of the world countries. The stated LOD and LLOQ should be satisfactory to pick up 
influenza virus.  
The sample size calculations were based on results of previous studies. The Applicant considered that a 
28 % decrease in disease duration to be clinically significant. The sample size calculations are 
endorsed. Patients were randomised according to age group (12-19 years and 20-64 years), region 
(Japan/Asia, Rest of the world), body weight (< 80 kg, ≥ 80 kg), and baseline symptom score, which 
in the OwH population was ≤ 11, ≥ 12, while it in the HR-group was ≤ 14, ≥ 15. These measures are 
considered clinically relevant.  
The use of the FAS (full analysis set) for the primary analysis is agreed. However, the Applicant 
excluded some subjects after randomisation, since they had been treated at a site with GCP non-
compliance, which is usually not acceptable, but the Applicant adequately clarified the reasons for the 
GCP non-compliance and provided additional analyses for the primary endpoints In addition, all “time 
to alleviation/improvement” endpoints were tested for statistically significant difference between 
treatment arms by generalised Wilcoxon tests (endorsed) but the effect estimates were reported as 
difference between medians. The applicant was asked to apply the three-step approach suggested in 
“Robust Design and Analysis of Clinical Trials with Non-proportional Hazards: A Straw Man Guidance 
from a Cross-pharma Working Group” (arXiv:1908.07112v1) and present the results. 
In short the applicant was required to perform (1) the MaxCombo test. However, no package for 
conducting the MaxCombo test was available for R/SAS. Therefore, the applicant has instead provided 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 130/159 
 
 
  
  
an assessment based on the MaxCombo principle. It was argued that, since the pattern of the studies 
T0831 and T0832 was described as “early separation”, the G1,0 test covered by the MaxCombo test is 
approximately equivalent to the Peto-Prentice test already used. (2) The Grambsch-Therneau test 
should be used to evaluate if the proportional hazards assumption is reasonable. The applicant did not 
perform this step, as proportionality of hazards was not assumed to begin with. Lastly, the applicant 
was asked to (3) Estimate the treatment effect. This was done by Restricted Mean Survival Time 
analysis (RMST) demonstrating TTAS/TTIS improvement of 18-21 hours in patients treated with 
baloxavir when compared to placebo. Overall, the statistical analysis plan is endorsed.  
GCP issues 
The CSR for 1601T0831 reports that findings of a site audit for a Study Centre (which was in both 
trials) as part of monitoring of 1602T0832, including critical and major deviations, led Shionogi to close 
the site when 10 patients had been enrolled. Subsequently, additional efficacy analyses were 
conducted after omitting data from that Centre, which did not impact on study conclusions. This much 
seems clear. It does not seem that audits of any other sites in 1601T0831 raised GCP concerns but this 
should be confirmed with a list of all audits conducted. 
According to section 9.8.1 of the CSR of 1602T0832, site audits identified critical and major deviations 
at three Sites and Shionogi decided to close these sites. However, the data indicate that the ITTI 
population eliminated 107 patients enrolled at 7 sites and this number included 32 with positive RT-
PCR (i.e. would not otherwise have been excluded from the ITTI population). The CSR sections that 
mention site closure and exclusion of data refer to appendix 16.1.8. However, this appendix provides 
only single page certificates recording that an audit was conducted, with no details of findings or 
explanation for decisions on elimination of data. There is no further explanation found in the CSR, 
Clinical overview or applicant’s Summary of efficacy. 
Both treatment studies involved a very (and unusually) large number of study sites.  The fact that site 
audits were conducted and action was taken is acknowledged but, with such a large number of sites, 
the applicant have reported the numbers/percentages that were audited. Also, since baloxavir has 
been approved for treatment of influenza by the US FDA, and FDA also inspected some sites, for which 
details have been provided. Even with such a large number of sites, it is unusual that data are 
excluded from 7 sites. The applicant has explained why data from two sites were not excluded.  
Overall, the issues concerning GCP have been fully addressed by the applicant and it does not seem 
necessary to trigger a GCP-inspection on data integrity.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses - Treatment of influenza infection 
Included patients were generally representative of the proposed indication, although it should be 
observed that the defined ‘high-risk’ group of patients did not fully correspond to the patient group 
defined be CDC-criteria (please refer to discussion above). The three study groups, baloxavir marboxil, 
oseltamivir, and placebo, were well balanced in term of demographics, previous medical history, and 
protocol deviations in both the OwH- and HR-populations. 
The studies met their primary objectives. Baloxavir marboxil decreased the time to alleviation (OwH 
patients) or time to improvement (high-risk patients) significantly as compared to placebo. There was 
no difference in times to alleviation/improvement between patients treated with baloxavir marboxil or 
the active comparator, oseltamivir. In the primary analyses comparing baloxavir marboxil with placebo, 
the Hodges-Lehmann  location shift demonstrated that the average time to  alleviation/improvement of 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 131/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
symptoms among all patients is reduced by 22.3 hours and 19.9 hours in Studies T0831 and T0832 
compared with placebo treatment, respectively. It appears that in the otherwise healthy population 
approx. 80% of patients treated with baloxavir marboxil recovered faster than patients, who received 
placebo. In both the baloxavir marboxil and placebo groups, approx. 80% of patients recovered by day 
5 after treatment initiation (i.e. 5-7 days after influenza onset). In the high-risk population patients 
recovered more slowly; by day 7 after treatment initiation, 80% of the baloxavir marboxil patients and 
73% of the placebo patients had recovered. Finally, time to alleviation was also measured in the high-
risk population and was shorter in the high-risk population. 
As noted, corrections for multiplicity were not used. Thus, the secondary endpoints are considered 
exploratory. Notwithstanding this limitation, all secondary endpoints appeared to favour treatment with 
baloxavir marboxil as compared to placebo, while the baloxavir marboxil and oseltamivir appeared 
similar also with regard to the secondary endpoints. Among analyses of secondary endpoints, the 
following should be noted: 
Efficacy by “baseline symptom score” 
The baseline stratification by symptom score was accounted for in the two primary analyses but the 
strata were defined differently in the two studies. Nevertheless, sub-group analyses showed that 
baloxavir gave statistically significant reductions in TTAS vs. placebo in the subgroups with baseline 
composite symptom scores ≤ 11 (19.1 h) and ≥ 12 (27.0 h) in 1601T0831 and statistically significant 
reductions in TTIS vs. placebo in the subgroups with baseline composite symptom score ≤ 14 (-14 h; 
64.4 vs. 78.4 h) or ≥ 15 (-23.6 h; 101.4 vs. 125 h) in 1602T0832. The marked difference in median 
TTIS values according to baseline score that was observed regardless of treatment group in this 
second study is notable and raises the question whether symptom scores showed a relationship to age, 
such that older patients were less likely to record high scores at baseline and post-baseline, resulting 
in them being more likely to be in the <15 category at baseline and to achieve resolution more quickly 
(see below regarding results in those aged 65+years in this study). This might be explained by 
differences in the proportions of patients from Asia and Europe/ North America between the three age 
groups.  
Regarding efficacy in subgroups, the following should be observed: 
The effect of baloxavir marboxil on time to alleviation (OwH)/ improvement (HR), i.e. the primary 
endpoints, was maintained across age, sex, and race (Japanese vs. American). It is noted that males 
recovered faster than females, which has also been described in literature, and that Japanese patients 
possibly recovered faster American patients. However, this was also noted in the placebo and 
oseltamivir groups. Thus, even though Japanese subjects were exposed to higher levels of baloxavir 
marboxil (please refer to the PK-section of this AR), the higher exposure was not translated into a 
different recovery rate between Japanese and American (evaluated as percentage shorter disease 
duration). However, there do not appear to be any obvious differences in age, virus type/subtype or 
medical history between the low and high baseline symptom score groups explaining the differences 
between Japanese and American subjects. The effect of baloxavir marboxil on time to alleviation 
(OwH)/ improvement (HR) was also maintained across body weight (above or below 80 kg). 
Efficacy by “at risk” categorisation in 1602T0832 
In 1602T0832 the median TTIS was also displayed by the applicant’s “at risk” categorisations. With 
asthma and other respiratory disorders predominating (~150 ITTI patients per group), baloxavir gave 
a statistically significant reduction in median TTIS in this subgroup (74.6 h vs. 110.2 h), very similar to 
the primary analysis. Whilst differences did not reach statistical significance in the smaller subgroups 
(note it is unclear if patients were counted in several analyses if they had multiple reasons to be study 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 132/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
eligible), the actual difference in median TTIS for baloxavir vs. placebo was also comparable with 
primary analysis results in the sub-groups with endocrine disorders (the applicant should clarify if most 
in this group only had diabetes), heart disorders or morbid obesity.  
In contrast, the difference in those aged 65+years (~100 per group) was -17.8 h, reflecting median 
values of 70 h vs. 87.8 h, i.e. a difference impacted by an unexpectedly short median TTIS for placebo. 
The CSR also reports that in the subset aged 65+ years who also had other risk factors the median 
TTIS was 67.9 h for baloxavir vs. 78.4 h for placebo. Furthermore, in the ~50 per group with metabolic 
disorders the median TTIS values were unusually short and showed no numerical benefit for baloxavir 
(56.8 h vs. 57.4 h).    
Median TTIS data by age subsets showed that there were 75-85 per group aged 65-74 years and 27 
per group aged 75+ years. The overall result for the 65+ years subset is driven by those aged from 
75+ years (-50.7 h; 65.1 h vs. 115.8 h) such that there was no apparent benefit of treatment in those 
aged 65-74 years (-6.1; 73 h vs. 79.1 h). It is very likely that these subgroup differences are not 
related to age per se but to differences in other factors. Most of the subjects aged 75+ years were 
enrolled in Japan but no host factors explained the observed difference. Meanwhile, it is not considered 
necessary to impose an upper age limit based on these dubious subgroup analyses. However, it cannot 
be ruled out from current data confined to one treatment study that the benefit of baloxavir may be 
less as age increases.   
Efficacy by time from onset to enrolment/dosing 
In 1601T0831 and in 1602T0832 only ~20% were enrolled when 36+ h had elapsed since symptom 
onset. Baloxavir gave statistically significant reductions in TTAS vs. placebo in 1601T0831 regardless 
of the time elapsed but the difference in median TTAS was 32.8 h when treatment started within 24 h 
compared to only 13.2 h when treatment started between 24 and 48 h. The applicant provided median 
TTAS broken down into the four 12-h intervals for 1601T0831 suggesting a waning effect of baloxavir 
as time between onset of symptoms and treatment, lengthens.  
In 1602T0832, baloxavir gave statistically significant reductions in TTIS vs. placebo in patients who 
were treated within 0 to 12 h, > 12 to 24 h or > 24 to 36 h with a numerical reduction for those 
treated within > 36 to 48 h but the actual differences were -47.7 h, -29.4 h, -39.5 h and -9.2 h in 
respective subgroups. Taking into account the data from both studies, the SmPC recommendation that 
treatment should be started within 48 h is acceptable.  
Efficacy in adolescents 
In 1601T0831 ~17% of the total ITTI population were aged 12-19 years. Baloxavir gave statistically 
significant reductions in TTAS vs. placebo in both adolescents (aged 12-17 years) and adults. Although 
the median TTAS in those who received baloxavir was 54 h in both age subsets, the median TTAS in 
the placebo group of only 27 adolescents was longer vs. adults who received placebo so the actual 
difference in median TTAS was greater in the adolescents vs. adults (38.6 h vs. 25.6 h).  
In 1602T0832 only ~5% of patients were aged 12-19 years. With 13 baloxavir and 12 placebo patients 
in this age range, no benefit for baloxavir was observed. However, the median TTIS was exceptionally 
long in the baloxavir and placebo groups (188 and 192 h) but exceptionally short in the oseltamivir 
group (73.4 h). In such small numbers these results may have occurred by chance. The underlying 
conditions that made these adolescents eligible for the study has been presented and 
overrepresentation of immunocompromised subjects in the baloxavir group does not appear to be the 
explanation of the observed differences.    
Efficacy in other special populations 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 133/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
Efficacy has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic and/or renal impairment, in patients with 
cancer or cancer within the last 5 years, or in pregnant women. These patients are defined as patients 
at high risk of influenza-related complications by the CDC criteria. T0832 included patients with a wide 
range of conditions with very different risk levels for complications of influenza and overall. Thus, the 
HR-population included in the studies, is actually a subpopulation of the ‘entire’ population at high-risk 
of influenza complications. Limited data on efficacy in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function 
has been obtained in the development program. Available data suggest that impaired renal or 
moderate impaired hepatic function does not affect efficacy of baloxavir. The efficacy of baloxavir in 
patients with severe hepatic function has not been established. 
Effect of prior vaccination against influenza 
In 1601T0831 about 25% of subjects had received influenza vaccine. In the vaccinated subgroup 
median TTAS for baloxavir vs. placebo was numerically shorter (52.1 vs, 71.9 h). A numerically longer 
TTAS was seen among placebo treated patients that did not receive an influenza vaccination (54.1 vs. 
81.2 h). In 1602T0832 a similar proportion had received influenza vaccine. In the vaccinated subgroup 
the median TTIS was numerically shorter for baloxavir vs. placebo (65.4 vs. 92.7 h) whereas median 
TTIS was significantly shorter for those who had not received an influenza vaccine (76.9 h vs. 103.1 
h). The findings suggest that patients with breakthrough influenza (i.e. disease despite vaccination) 
may have been less ill but could still derive a benefit from intervention. 
Virological data from treatment studies 
A/H3 was very predominant (~85%) in 1601T08312. A/H3 predominated to a lesser extent in 
1602T0832 (just under 50%) with < 10% having H1N1. Numbers with type B infection in the Phase 2 
study and in 1601T0831 were small 24 and 38, respectively, per study had type B and received 40 mg 
baloxavir). The proportion with type B in 1602T0832 was much higher (~40% per group). Overall, 
there were no concerns regarding type-specific clinical effects of baloxavir.  
Baseline susceptibility to baloxavir and oseltamivir was determined at central laboratories. The median 
baloxavir EC50 values for baseline isolates compared to reference strains indicate no substantial shifts. 
Both the plaque assay applied in Phase 2 and Virospot assay applied in Phase 3 showed that median 
EC50 values for baloxavir were about 4-5-fold higher for type B vs. type A strains. However, the ranges 
indicated that some strains had 10-40-fold higher baloxavir EC50 values compared to the median value.  
Despite the occurrence of strains with unusually high EC50 values, the applicant’s summary of efficacy 
states that no baseline substitutions (vs. references strains) were associated with reduced 
susceptibility to baloxavir. Genotypic testing was conducted for at least for baloxavir-treated patients 
with virus having higher EC50 values and that some phenotypic testing was conducted. The conclusions 
are limited by the small numbers with EC50 FC values ≥10. However, these is no consistent relationship 
visualised between FC EC50 and TTAS or TTIS and it does not seem that any one substitution can 
explain the FC EC50 values. There was also no clear relationship between baseline EC50 values and 
changes in TCID50 over time based on these few data.   
Importantly, using a neuraminidase inhibition assay, there was no evidence of shifts in median IC50 
values for oseltamivir for isolates from the Phase 3 studies. Also, the upper end of the ranges indicated 
no more than a 7-fold increase vs. reference strains, indicating the comparisons of antiviral and clinical 
effects between baloxavir and oseltamivir were not confounded by resistance to oseltamivir. However, 
median IC50 values were 6-7-fold higher for type B vs. type A strains.

In between 2 and 10 % of the influenza infected OwH or HR patients, who were treated with baloxavir 
marboxil, changes in the viral PA gene were observed. No changes to the PA gene were found in the 
patients, who received placebo, or patients exposed to oseltamivir. Similarly, changes in the PB1 and 
PB2 genes were observed in a smaller number of virus samples from patients treated with baloxavir 
marboxil in the OwH-studies. The possible clinical impact of these gene changes could not be properly 
evaluated due to the relatively low number of patients, who were infected with a virus that expressed 
the gene changes (the sample sizes were also reduced due to exclusion of patients without virus 
samples both at pre- and post-dosing). However, such changes could indicate a selection pressure and 
be of importance in case of an influenza epidemic, where treatment would be used continuously over 
months. A recently published study indicates that influenza A/H1N1 2009 pandemic (A/H1N1pdm) and 
A/H3N2 viruses, carrying an I38T mutation in the polymerase acidic protein were fit and transmissible 
through respiratory droplets; the study indicates the clinical relevance of the mutation in terms of 
return of symptoms and transmitting bxm-resistant strains (Imai M. et al. Nature Microbiology 5, 27-
33 (2020)). The Applicant has presented all available evidence including literature data (human and 
animal) related to resistance development. The presented data suggest that baloxavir-resistant viruses 
rarely emerge and I38T mutant viruses become a minority due to reduced fitness compared to the 
wildtype virus. 
Protocol deviations 
In both Phase 3 treatment studies the most common protocol deviation was administration of 
prohibited concomitant medications. It is likely that most of these transgressions involved use of 
symptomatic treatments other than the allowed paracetamol or low dose aspirin. However, these 
patients were excluded from the per protocol (PP) population. It is therefore important to note that 
both studies showed statistically significant differences for baloxavir vs. placebo on TTAS/TTIS in the 
PP populations.   
Design and conduct of clinical studies - Post-exposure Prophylaxis 
A single study, T0834, has been included in the MAA to support the indication of baloxavir marboxil for 
post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in individuals aged 12 and above.  
Study T0834 is a household influenza prophylaxis placebo-controlled trial conducted in Japan in the 
2018-2019 influenza season. Index patients were included less than 48 hours after onset of symptoms. 
Influenza infection in index patients was confirmed with a RT-PCR. Eligible and volunteer household 
members of all age groups living with the index patients, were randomly assigned to a single dose of 
either baloxavir or placebo. Subjects were included if able to provide informed consent within 48 hours 
from the onset of symptoms in index patients and within 24 hours from the time of informed consent 
in index patients, i.e. within 48 hours. Baloxavir marboxil dosing was dependent on age and body 
weight at screening. The baloxavir marboxil single dose administrations used in study T0834 are the 
approved doses used for treatment of influenza virus infection outside EU. The doses have been found 
to have an acceptable safety profile. Dosing recommendations in the study include dosing in children < 
12 years of age whereas the PEP indication is confined to adolescents from 12 years and adults. 
Plasma baloxavir concentrations are predicted to be above the expected preventive levels (≥ 0.444 
and ≥ 2.35 ng/mL for influenza A and B virus, respectively) for approximately 10 days. The doses used 
in study T0384 are considered appropriate. 
The study was conducted in a double-blind fashion by using matching indistinguishable placebo in 
appearance, labelling, and packaging. The double-blind trial set-up is key as the primary endpoint is 
partly based on the individual subjects’ self-evaluation of symptoms. In total, 752 subjects were 
included in the study, and 749 were included in the mITT population. Few subjects were excluded and 
there were no apparent differences in subjects being excluded across treatment groups.  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 135/159 
 
 
  
  
The case definition and duration of capture for 1-10 days is appropriate. The index case was to have 
had had onset within 48 h and three quarters of subjects were enrolled within 24 h of symptom onset 
in the index case. In the SmPC it is stated that baloxavir marboxil should be taken as soon as possible 
within the 48-h window after close contact with an individual known or suspected to have influenza, 
which is acceptable. It is specified in section 5.1 of the SmPC that the majority of index patients were 
included within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. 
Not all household members of the recruited index patients were included in the study. For the majority 
of index patients (71.6%), only one subject was included from the household. It could be argued that 
there would be a larger risk of influenza in larger households where all members are not either treated 
or receive prophylaxis. An alternative option to the treatment assignment in T0834, all household 
members could have been randomized to either baloxavir or placebo, such that all members of the 
same household would receive the same drug or control in line with FDA guidance for Developing 
Drugs for Treatment and/or Prophylaxis. Even though the study design implied risk of intra-household-
correlation, such a relation was not demonstrated.  
The baloxavir and placebo subject groups were comparable. The study was conducted in Japan and all 
subjects were Asian of origin. It should be noted that 55 (14.7 %) and 52 (13.9 %) of subjects were 
below 10 years of age in the baloxavir and placebo group respectively. The youngest subjects were 1 
year old. The study has 71 subjects < 12 years of age in both treatment groups reflecting close to 20 
% of included subjects and these subjects are included in the primary endpoint. The number of 
paediatric subjects included in study T0834 is beyond what was requested in the PIP. No waiver has 
been granted by PDCO for neither the treatment nor the PEP indication.  
The proposed age restriction in the indication, i.e. post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in individuals 
aged 12 and above is therefore not fully understood, since study T0834 has been completed with 142 
paediatric subjects < 12 years of age included.  
Few elderly subjects have been included. In total 23, (8 subjects ≥ 65 years in the baloxavir group and 
15 subjects in the placebo group) were included in the study.  
Less than 1 % of index patients had influenza B. The predominant subtypes were A/H3NX (48.6%) and 
A/H1N1pdm (46.8%) in accordance with the most prevalent subtypes in the 2018-2019 influenza 
season (global WHO data for the same period (95.4% influenza A, 4.6% influenza B). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who were infected with influenza virus 
(reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] positive), and presented with fever and at 
least one respiratory symptom in the period from Day 1 to Day 10 defined as the proportion of 
subjects having body temperature (axillary) ≥ 37.5°C, having symptom of “cough” or “nasal 
discharge/nasal congestion” with a severity of “2, Moderate” or “3, Severe” assessed in the subject 
diary, and influenza virus positive assessed by RT-PCR. A list of subgroup analyses were prespecified 
e.g. Time from onset of influenza virus infection of index patient to informed consent of subject (< 24 
hours or ≥ 24 hours), Treatment for influenza virus infection of index patient (baloxavir marboxil or 
other than baloxavir marboxil), Age of subject (< 12 years or ≥ 12 years) and High risk factor of 
subject (Presence or Absence). Secondary endpoints with different variations of influenza symptoms 
and time from study treatment to subjects presenting with fever or at least one influenza symptom 
were also analysed.  
The primary endpoint is clinically relevant. Prevention of asymptomatic influenza would not be seen as 
a benefit to the individual, though it could prevent viral shedding and therefore have value in a public 
health perspective. As no multiplicity adjustment is made in T0834 only the primary endpoint is 
controlled for and all secondary endpoints are considered exploratory.       
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 136/159 
 
 
  
  
The applicant used a modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population instead of following the intent-to-treat 
principle and including all randomised subjects. However, the requirement of post baseline observation 
lead to exclusion of three subjects out of 752 from the randomised analysis set. Given the low number 
it is not considered to affect the result of the trial and therefore the ITT analysis is not requested. 
Additional analyses have been performed in order to evaluate the implications of the stochastic 
minimisation allocation method and to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis method. The 
supplementary analyses have confirmed the robustness of the primary analysis method.  
Overall, the design and size and conduct of study T0834 is considered adequate.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses - Post-exposure Prophylaxis 
Study T0834 met its primary endpoint and efficacy is supported by the supplementary analysis.  
In the mITT population, the proportion of subjects with influenza virus infection (RT-PCR positive), 
fever, and at least one respiratory symptom during the period from Day 1 to Day 10 was statistically 
significantly lower in the baloxavir marboxil group than in the placebo group (1.9% vs. 13.6%; 
adjusted risk ratio 0.14 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.30], p < 0.0001). A risk reduction of 86 % is considered 
clinically relevant, and in absolute numbers, the number needed to treat to prevent one case of 
influenza is 9 (ARR= 13.6 – 1.9 = 11,7 %, NNT = 1/ 0.117 = 8.5). However, the risk reduction of 86 
% is in a population where the index patient also is administered an anti-influenza treatment.  
The number of events is low, 7 and 51 subjects with influenza in baloxavir and placebo respectively. 
This limits the interpretation of the study and analysis of subgroup.  
The proportion of subjects who were infected with influenza virus (RT-PCR positive) and presented with 
fever and at least one respiratory symptom from Day 1 to Day 10 was lower in the baloxavir marboxil 
group than in the placebo group for both subgroups of subjects younger and older than 12 years, but 
the adjusted risk ratio was higher in the youngest age group, but again numbers are limited.  
The number of subjects with high risk factors (CDC criteria) was 12.3% and 13.9%. The majority of 
subjects were low risk patients. Twelve subjects showed a confirmed influenza type or subtype 
different from their respective index patient. The index cases showed an equal split between 
A/H1N1pdm and A/H3NX, which is described in the CSR as an unidentified subtype of neuraminidase. 
The tests used could not determine the N type. However, in most cases it was assumed that the N type 
was N2 as this was the predominant circulating type. Baloxavir  marboxil has been shown to be 
effective against a wide range of influenza viruses. While influenza viruses vary somewhat  from season 
to season, baloxavir targets the cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor  which is a highly conserved 
internal component of the virus and not subject to the  antigenic drift that is a feature of external virus 
components such as haemagglutinin. No subjects were infected with influenza B virus in either 
treatment group. The prevalence of influenza B virus was low in the influenza season, where the study 
was conducted. Efficacy against influenza B virus has been demonstrated in the treatment trials.  
In contrast to standard of care in EU, all index patients received anti-influenza treatment, 52.7 % 
baloxavir marboxil. It is therefore difficult to conclude on the prophylactic effect of baloxavir if the 
index patients are not treated. The adjusted risk ratio for primary endpoint was 0.24 in the subgroup 
of subjects where the index patient was treated with baloxavir compared to 0.07 in the subgroup 
where the index patient was treated with another anti-influenza product. Though numbers are small, 
the result is noteworthy. It is also note-worthy that none of the placebo-treated subjects had amino 
acid substitutions compared to 10 and 5 for PA/I38X and PA/E23K respectively in subjects treated with 
baloxavir. This raises concerns of selection pressure and influenza strain resistance to baloxavir. It is 
acknowledged that for the individual, tolerance to baloxavir administered as a single dose not is 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 137/159 
 
 
  
  
expected to be a concern. However, as seen in the subgroup analysis, subjects had a trend of higher 
influenza risk if the index patient had been treated with baloxavir compared to other anti-influenza 
products. However, since only 3 out of 26 subjects were found to have virus with I38X substitutions 
later in the study and since baseline data were not available for 2 of the 3 of interest, nothing can be 
concluded on the risk of RAMs in baseline positives given baloxavir.   
There was no apparent difference in efficacy in the subgroup analysis of vaccination status in either 
index patient or subject.   
The secondary efficacy endpoint results overall support the primary endpoint results. The difference in 
RMST between the treatment groups of 0.8 days is difficult to interpret and, therefore, these data has 
not been included in the discussion of the clinical relevance and are not included in the SmPC. 
A puzzling result is that the proportion of subjects with asymptomatic influenza virus infection was 
similar in both groups, but this reflects that a larger proportion of subjects in the baloxavir group who 
catch influenza compared to the placebo group will be asymptomatic, i.e. 29/49 (59%) vs 29/114 (25 
%). Available virology data from study T0834 cannot address the question is baloxavir marboxil can 
have an impact on viral transmission. This issue is under investigation in a clinical study. It is agreed 
that viral shedding and transmission would be expected to be lower in asymptomatic individuals. 
Based on the results of a real-world-data study with oseltamivir, the Applicant does not expect 
retreatment to be likely. Simulations of various retreatment scenarios predicted minimal accumulation 
of baloxavir marboxil during weekly retreatment. No accumulation of baloxavir was expected for 
retreatment every 2 or 4 weeks. Additionally, findings from CP40617 did not raise safety concerns 
when baloxavir marboxil were administered on Day 1, Day 4, and Day 7 if required, in combination 
with standard-of-case neuraminidase inhibitor. However, no clinical data are available for the efficacy 
or safety of retreatment in the PEP setting. Therefore, retreatment is not recommended in the PEP 
setting. This has been specified in section 4.2 of the SmPC.   
The prerequisites of a single pivotal trial ((CPMP/EWP/2330/99)) and whether the proposed indication 
can be adequately supported by study T0834 alone needs be taken into consideration. These include 
both the internal validity and external validity of the study. The internal validity of study T0834 is 
considered appropriate and the efficacy results of the study convincing, though numbers are small. 
However, the external validity of the study could be questioned as study T0834 was conducted in 
Japan, mainly in subjects < 65 years of age, with extrapolation from one influenza season without 
incidences of B-influenza to all influenza seasons, and since all index patients had anti-influenza 
treatment. Extrapolation to a broader population is justified by reasonably comparable exposure. 
Extrapolation to other influenza types and subtypes is justified based on in vitro data and efficacy in 
treatment studies in different seasons. Finally, treatment of index patients may reduce viral 
transmission lowering the risk of infection of household members. Therefore, extrapolation to a setting 
with non-treated index patients with potentially (slightly) higher transmission is acceptable. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Both the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis indications are proposed from 12 years of age. 
Adults and adolescents from 12 years of age were included in study T0831 (OwH) + T0832 (HR), and 
the paediatric development in the treatment indication is ongoing. In study T0834 - conducted to 
support the PEP indication - smaller children (> 10 kg) were included and the study has been finalised. 
PK data from paediatric subjects < 12 years are available but have not been submitted.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
From a treatment of influenza infection point of view, the studies met their primary endpoint, i.e. the 
time to alleviation (otherwise healthy patients) or time to improvement (high-risk patients) was 
significantly decreased in baloxavir marboxil treated patients as compared to placebo treated patients. 
There was no difference in times to alleviation/improvement between baloxavir marboxil and the active 
comparator, oseltamivir.  
While the secondary endpoints are considered exploratory due to insufficient handling of these, they all 
in all supported a favourable outcome in the baloxavir marboxil group as compared to placebo, e.g. 
time with viral shedding, time with fever and respiratory symptoms, and the number of complications 
in the HR groups was reduced. 
With regard to prophylaxis, a single pivotal study has been submitted to support the PEP indication for 
baloxavir marboxil. Study T0834 met its primary endpoint and efficacy is supported by the 
supplementary analysis.  
The single PEP study followed on from two successful treatment studies and used the same dose as for 
treatment, which is considered acceptable. The fact that the study was confined to Japan is not a 
major concern, and both the internal and external validity of the trial has been clarified.  
In conclusion, no outstanding issues remain.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Xofluza resistance reports should be submitted annually to EMA as a post-marketing requirement (to 
be discussed in the PSUR) 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
For the safety assessment of baloxavir marboxil in other-wise healthy (OwH) patients, the safety data 
from the two OwH Studies T0831 and T0821 were pooled, resulting in a total of 1632 patients in the 
safety population. From the baloxavir marboxil group in Study T0821, only the patients who received a 
40 mg dose (n = 100) were included in the pooled dataset as this is one of the to-be marketed doses. 
For the safety assessment of baloxavir marboxil in patients at high risk of developing influenza-related 
complications (HR patients), the pivotal Phase 3 Study T0832 provided safety data from 2178 HR adult 
and adolescent patients comprising the safety population.  
For the safety assessment of baloxavir marboxil in household members of influenza-infected patients 
the phase 3 PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) Study T0834 provided safety data from 749 subjects. 
Patient exposure 
In 12 phase 1 studies 329 adults received single 6 mg to 80 mg doses of baloxavir marboxil; and in 2 
paediatric studies 140 children below 12 yoa received baloxavir marboxil in weight-adjusted doses. 
Table 43 shows the number of subjects exposed to one dose of baloxavir marboxil in the 4 main 
studies (T0821, T0831, T0832, and T0834) by age and gender. Females constituted 56% of the total 
exposed population, 79% of the exposed PEP population. In total 71 (3.5%) children below 12 were 
included, while 109 (5.4%) of the subjects were 12-17 years old.

Adverse events 
The AE profile was similar between treatment groups and between the OwH and HR populations.  No 
new safety signals were identified. As expected, a slightly higher incidence of AEs was observed in the 
HR population across all treatment groups compared with the pooled OwH population, Table 39 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020

Table 39  Overall Summary of Adverse Events in Pooled OwH Studies T0831/T0821 and HR 
Study T-832 (Safety Population) 
By preferred term, the most common AEs (≥ 2%) in baloxavir marboxil-treated patients were bronchitis 
(2.4%) and diarrhoea (2.8%) in the OwH population, and bronchitis (2.9%), diarrhoea (2.7%), and 
nausea (2.7%) in the HR population. In all cases, the incidence was similar to or lower than the 
incidence in the placebo and oseltamivir groups. 
The severity of AEs was consistent between the OwH and HR populations.  In both patient populations, 
the majority of AEs were mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2). Also, the incidence of treatment-
related AEs was consistent between the pooled OwH studies and the HR study. 
The incidence of abnormal changes in liver function tests (< 2% in any population and treatment 
group) and AEs related to hepatic disorders was low (< 3%) and generally similar between treatment 
groups and between the OwH and HR populations. Finally, the incidence of AEs related to 
neuropsychiatric disorders was low (< 4% in any population and treatment group) and generally similar 
between treatment groups and between the OwH and HR populations.  
Regarding the PEP study, the overall incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs (assessed by the 
investigator) was also almost similar between the baloxavir marboxil and placebo, Table 45.  
Influenza virus infection itself was not reported as an AE. Regarding symptoms of influenza infection 
(cough, sore throat, headache, nasal discharge/nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint 
pain, and fatigue), these were reported as AEs unless both of the following conditions were met at the 
study visit: 1) The subject was diagnosed with influenza virus infection using a rapid influenza 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 141/159 
 
 
  
  
 
diagnostic test (RIDT positive) and 2) The symptom was related to influenza virus infection, in the 
opinion of the investigator. If both conditions were met, the symptom was not reported as an AE in the 
CRF.  
Table 40 Overall Summary of Adverse Events in PEP Study T0834 (Safety Population)  
The most commonly reported AEs (≥ 1% of subjects in either treatment group) were nasopharyngitis 
(baloxavir marboxil: 6.4% and placebo: 6.7%), headache (2.1% and 1.6%), blood urine present 
(1.6% and 0.3%; all blood urine present AEs were Grade 1 in severity and were recorded in female 
subjects only), pharyngitis (1.1% and 0.3%), and ALT increased (1.1% and 0.3%).  
All AEs were Grade 1−2 in the baloxavir marboxil and placebo groups, with the exception of one Grade 
3 AE (psychotic disorder) in the placebo group. The vast majority of AEs resolved or were resolving by 
the end of the study (98.0% in both treatment groups) for QC bxm total 102 AEs – 1 unknown – 1 not 
recovered = 98.0% pbo 99 AEs – 2 not recovered = 98.0%. 
The incidence of abnormal changes in liver function tests was ≤ 1% in either treatment group; in the 
baloxavir marboxil group, no Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin occurred. No 
subject experienced ALT or AST > 3 x ULN simultaneously with a total bilirubin > 2 x ULN.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No fatal SAEs were reported in the OwH studies. In HR Study T0832, 1 patient in the oseltamivir group 
had a fatal SAE of pneumonia (onset on Day 12 and death on Day 38) and 1 patient in the baloxavir 
marboxil group had a fatal SAE of acute myocardial infarction (SAE onset prior to study drug 
administration on Day 1 and death on Day 24). 
The incidence of SAEs was overall low in both the pooled OwH studies and the HR study. Two patients 
(0.3%) in the pooled OwH Studies T0831/T0821, both in the baloxavir marboxil group of Study T0831, 
experienced SAEs of viral meningitis and incarcerated inguinal hernia, neither of which were considered 
related to study treatment. The incidence of SAEs (excluding death) in HR Study T0832 was low and 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 142/159 
 
 
  
  
 
similar across the 3 treatment groups, occurring in 5 patients (0.7%) in the baloxavir marboxil group, 
9 patients (1.2%) in the placebo group, and 8 patients (1.1%) in the oseltamivir group 
In the PEP Study T0834 no deaths were reported; and there were no SAEs reported in the baloxavir 
marboxil group; one SAE (psychotic disorder) was reported in the placebo group, which had not 
resolved by the end of study.  
Laboratory findings 
Within each study (T0831, T0821, and T0832), no clinically relevant differences between treatment 
groups were observed in haematology, chemistry, or urinalysis laboratory parameters. The most 
common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein and abnormalities in differential 
white blood cell counts; however, these are common during infections. The abnormalities occurred 
most frequently at the baseline visit, were similar in all treatment groups within each of the three 
studies, and returned to normal levels by the last study visit in the majority of patients. 
In the PEP study no clinically, relevant differences were found in changes from baseline or in 
proportion of subjects with abnormalities in haematology, blood chemistry, or urinalysis laboratory 
parameters between the baloxavir marboxil and the placebo group. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 
laboratory abnormalities was low at each measured timepoint (Days 1, 5, and 15) in the baloxavir 
marboxil group (maximum 0.8%) and the placebo group (maximum 1.6%) for each parameter tested 
Safety in special populations 
For the pooled OwH studies (T0831/T0821), subgroup AE analyses were performed by age (T0831 
only: < 18 or ≥ 18 years), body weight at baseline (< 80 kg or ≥ 80 kg), gender (male or female), race 
(Asian or Non-Asian), and region (Japan or United States). For the HR T0832 study, subgroup AE 
analyses were performed by age (<18, 18 − 64, 65 − 74, or ≥ 75 years), body weight at baseline (< 80 
kg or ≥ 80 kg), gender (male or female), race (Asian or Non-Asian), HR category (asthma or chronic 
lung disease, endocrine disorders, ≥ 65 years of age, heart disease, morbid obesity, metabolic 
disorders), and region (Asia or North America / Europe).  
Overall, in both OwH and HR populations, there were no apparent or clinically meaningful differences 
found in the age, body weight, gender, HR category (T0832 only), or race subgroup analyses.  
In OwH Study T0831 infections and infestations were the most frequent SOC in the age-group ≥ 18 
years with around 10% affected followed by GI disorders, appr 7%, in all three arms. For the age 
group < 18 infections/infestations were reported in 4% in the baloxavir group, in 15% in the placebo 
group. GI disorders were more equally represented with appr 6% in both groups. In the HR Study 
T0832 only a total of 13 patients in the age group < 18 years had any AE. For the age groups 18-64 
and 65-74 appr 27% had any AE in all 3 arms. Again infections/infestations were the most frequently 
represented SOC. For the age group ≥ 75 years many more patients had any AE: 30-45%. GI 
disorders was the most frequent SOC with most patients reporting nausea. 
By region, across all treatment groups in the pooled OwH population, patients in the Japan subgroup 
(baloxavir marboxil: 24.4%, placebo: 27.1% oseltamivir: 26.5%) had a higher incidence of AEs 
compared with the United States subgroup (baloxavir marboxil: 16.1%, placebo: 22.5% oseltamivir: 
22.2%).  However, most AEs occurred at low frequencies and no particular AE was markedly higher in 
the Japan subgroup compared to the United States subgroup. In the HR T0832 study, there were 
generally no clinically meaningful differences in the incidence or nature of AEs by region (between 
regions or between treatment groups within regions).  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 143/159 
 
 
  
  
In the PEP study subgroup analysis was performed by age using < 12 and ≥ 12 years of age subgroups. 
Of the 749 subjects in the safety population, 142 were < 12 years of age. In both treatment groups, a 
slightly higher proportion of subjects aged < 12 years experienced an AE (25.4% in both treatment 
groups) compared with the ≥ 12 years subgroup (baloxavir marboxil: 21.5% and placebo: 19.4%). 
However, no relevant differences in the nature of AEs was observed across the age subgroups. Across 
treatment groups, similar proportions of subjects experienced an AE for patients weighing < 20 kg 
(baloxavir marboxil: 42.1%, placebo: 32.3%), 20 to < 40 kg (17.5% and 18.6%), 40 to < 80 kg 
(21.8% and 20.1%), and ≥ 80 kg (22.2% and 11.1%, respectively). The frequency of AEs was higher 
in the age group weighing < 20 kg; however, the number was very low. Of the 749 subjects, 78.4% 
were female. In both treatment groups, a similar proportion female (baloxavir marboxil: 22.9% and 
placebo: 22.1%) and male (baloxavir marboxil: 19.5% and placebo: 15.3%) subjects experienced an 
AE.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug interaction studies including Study T0814 (interaction study with midazolam), Study T0815 
(itraconazole), Study T0818 (oseltamivir phosphate), T081C (probenecid), and T081D (digoxin and 
rosuvastatin) did not reveal any safety or tolerability findings when these drugs were administered 
concomitantly with baloxavir marboxil.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal of study drug was < 1% in both the OwH Study T0831 and 
the HR Study T0832. In the PEP study no AE led to discontinuation in the baloxavir marboxil group; in 
the placebo group one subject had an AE (psychotic disorder) that led to discontinuation.  
Post marketing experience 
The first authorisation of baloxavir marboxil was in Japan for the treatment of influenza A or B virus 
infection in otherwise healthy patients on 23 February 2018.  
Since March 2018, an estimated cumulative total of 5,902,702 patients (5,653,250 in Japan, 240,266 
in the US, and 9,186 in rest of the world countries) have received baloxavir marboxil in the post-
marketing setting. 
The Applicant has evaluated the post-marketing data received since the initial commercial distribution 
of baloxavir marboxil on 14 March 2018 up to 22 August 2019 (approximately 18 months after the 
international birth date [IBD]).  
Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) was confirmed as a safety signal from post-
marketing data and has been added as an ADR to the product label as a risk mitigation action. The 
Applicant continues to monitor such events for any change in nature, frequency, or severity. The 
Applicant considers haemorrhagic events,  in association with use of baloxavir marboxil, to be a 
validated signal from post-marketing data, and a full evaluation is ongoing.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of Baloxavir Marboxil was evaluated in three phase 3 studies (Studies T0831, T0832 and 
T0834) and one phase 2 dose-finding study (Study T0821). The applicant has for the purpose of the 
SCS pooled the safety data from Studies T0831 and T0821. The target population for Studies 
T0831/T0821 (n=1632) was OwH patients with influenza symptoms aged 12 to 64 years (Study 
T0831) or aged 20 to 64 years (Study T0821). Patients with severe underlying diseases and patients 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 144/159 
 
 
  
  
who had any of the risk factors as defined in the CDC criteria were excluded. The target population of 
Study T0832 (n=2178) was patients ≥ 12 years of age (no upper age limit) with influenza symptoms 
and considered at high risk of developing influenza-related complications (criteria adapted from the 
CDC criteria). The target population for the prophylaxis study T0834 (n=749) was subjects of all ages 
who were household members of influenza-infected patients.  
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups 
within each population / each study; and results were generally similar to those described for the ITTI 
population in the SCE. In the pooled OwH population only 29% were white, while this was the case for 
59% in the HR population. In total white subjects constituted 46% (1759/3810) of the two populations 
– and of these 1759 white patients, 638 were exposed to baloxavir marboxil. As the PEP study was 
conducted in Japan only no further white persons were included in the safety-populations. In the HR 
study the disease seemed to be more serious with a higher symptom score, but the frequency of 
patients tested negative for influenza virus was significantly higher than in the pooled OwH studies.  
Treatment of influenza with baloxavir marboxil was overall well tolerated and no apparent safety 
concerns were identified. The safety profile was overall consistent between treatment groups and 
between the pooled OwH population and the HR population, see above.  
A slightly higher incidence of AEs was observed in the HR population compared with the pooled OwH 
population across all treatment groups.  However, the incidence of treatment-related AEs was 
consistent between the pooled OwH studies and the HR study. In both populations, the incidence of 
treatment-related AEs was higher in the oseltamivir-group as compared to the baloxavir marboxil 
group. 
The most commonly reported AEs were bronchitis, sinusitis, diarrhoea, nausea (Study T0831 & 
T0832), nasopharyngitis, seasonal allergy, vertigo, headache, diarrhoea, gastritis (Study T0821). The 
AE-pattern was consistent among treatment groups. No AE was reported in ≥ 5% in any treatment 
group in any study. The majority of the AEs were Grade 1-2, and the majority resolved. In Study 
T0821 no dose-dependent increases in AEs were observed. 
SAEs were reported in 2 patients only in the pooled OwH studies (viral meningitis, incarcerated 
inguinal hernia; not related to study drug). Thirty-one SAEs were reported in the HR study; however, 
none of the 7 SAEs occurring in 5 patients in the baloxavir marboxil group were treatment-related. The 
severity of AEs was consistent between the OwH and HR populations. In both patient populations, the 
majority of AEs were mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2). 
No fatal AEs were reported in the OwH studies. In HR Study T0832, 1 patient in the oseltamivir group 
had a fatal AE of pneumonia (onset on Day 12 and death on Day 38) and 1 patient in the baloxavir 
marboxil group had a fatal AE of acute myocardial infarction (AE onset prior to study drug 
administration on Day 1 and death on Day 24). 
The incidences of AEs leading to withdrawal of study drug were low in all treatment groups in both the 
OwH studies and in the HR study. 
The incidence of abnormal changes in liver function tests, AEs related to hepatic disorders and the 
incidence of AEs related to neuropsychiatric disorders was low and generally similar between treatment 
groups and between the OwH and HR populations. 
Regarding laboratory data, it is concluded that within each study, no clinically relevant differences 
between treatment groups were observed in haematology, chemistry, or urinalysis laboratory 
parameters. The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein and 
abnormalities in differential white blood cell counts, which are common during infections. These 
abnormalities occurred most frequently at the baseline visit, were similar in all treatment groups within 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 145/159 
 
 
  
  
each of the three studies, and returned to normal levels by the last study visit in the majority of 
patients.  
In Study T0821 clinically significant abnormal ECG findings were noted in 4 patients. There was one 
case of baloxavir-unrelated bradycardia. The remaining 3 cases were “considered to be caused by their 
existing medical condition at baseline.” However, as the patients were per inclusion criteria “otherwise 
healthy” the applicant clarified on request, that the ECGs showed ventricular extrasystoles (1 pt) and 
right bundle branch block (2 pts). As these ECG diagnoses are clinically insignificant, it was acceptable 
to include the patients   
Analyses of AEs by Intrinsic factors (age, body weight, gender, race, high risk category) and Extrinsic 
factor (region) revealed no apparent differences in frequencies and nature of AEs among treatment 
groups and studies. Only 638 white patients have been exposed to baloxavir marboxil and from the 
analyses of AEs by race it appears that diarrhoea, vomiting, bronchitis and sinusitis were more 
frequent among non-Asian patients. However, the overall incidence of AEs appears higher in the Asian 
population compared with the non-Asians within each of the treatment groups. Taking into account the 
size of each comparator group and the low numbers of AEs reported, and comparing the overall AE 
incidence for each race subgroup across treatment groups, the rate was higher in the placebo 
subgroups compared with the corresponding baloxavir marboxil subgroups.  
No ADRs were identified as for no AEs both criteria for ADRs were met in any of the OwH + HR safety 
populations.  
In PEP Study T0834 the pattern of AEs was the same as described above: The overall incidence of AEs 
and treatment-related AEs (assessed by the investigator) was similar between the baloxavir marboxil 
and placebo groups (22.2% vs. 20.5% and 1.9% vs. 1.6%, respectively). Pharyngitis, headache, blood 
urine present, and ALT increased were numerically higher in the baloxavir marboxil group than in the 
placebo group; however, the Sponsor assessment of causality which was based on both individual and 
aggregate case review of events revealed that these AEs were most likely related to factors other than 
baloxavir marboxil.  
All AEs in the PEP study were Grade 1−2 with the exception of one Grade 3 AE (psychotic disorder) in 
the placebo group; the vast majority of AEs resolved or were resolving by the end of the study (98.0% 
in both treatment groups) for QC bxm total 102 AEs – 1 unknown – 1 not recovered = 98.0%  pbo 99 
AEs – 2 not recovered = 98.0%. No deaths were reported; and only one SAE (psychotic disorder) was 
reported in the placebo group - which led to discontinuation of study drug. Furthermore, the incidence 
of abnormal changes in liver function tests was low (≤ 1% in either treatment group); in the baloxavir 
marboxil group, no Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin occurred. No subject 
experienced ALT or AST > 3 × ULN simultaneously with a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN. None of 20 
neuropsychiatric AEs were considered treatment-related. 
None of the AEs fulfilled the criteria for an ADR – and consequently no AEs reported in the 4 main 
studies should be included in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Further to the four phase 2 and 3 studies the applicant has in the SCS included information about 12 
phase 1 studies: 329 healthy subjects or patients with moderate hepatic impairment received single 6 
to 80 mg doses of baloxavir marboxil. No deaths or other SAEs occurred in any of the studies. Most of 
the AEs were mild, and of the AEs that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects in any of the studies (increased ALT, 
increased eosinophils, increased white blood cells, dizziness, nausea, headache, and nasopharyngitis), 
only headache occurred in more than 1 study. 
Two paediatric studies have been completed in which a total of 140 children received baloxavir 
marboxil. In both studies, there were no deaths, SAEs, or AEs leading to withdrawal. All AEs were 
Grade 1−2 and most of them resolved by the end of the study. The most common AE was vomiting, all 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 146/159 
 
 
  
  
of which were Grade 1 in severity and were not considered related to study drug. No significant safety 
concerns were identified and baloxavir marboxil was generally well tolerated. 
Post-marketing data: Baloxavir marboxil was approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza A or B 
virus infection in otherwise healthy patients across all age ranges (body weight ≥ 10 kg) on 23 
February 2018. Since then, baloxavir marboxil has been approved in a number of other countries 
around the world, including the United States, for the treatment of influenza in patients aged 12 and 
above who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. In Thailand, baloxavir marboxil is also 
approved for treating patients who are at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. It is 
estimated that a total of 5,902,702 patients (5,653,250 in Japan, 240,266 in the US, and 9,186 in rest 
of the world countries) have received baloxavir marboxil.  
During the reporting period a total of 6831 AEs were received spontaneously of which 820 were 
considered serious. In addition, 316 solicited events (of which 8 were serious) from non-interventional 
studies were reported (studies which will be reported when evaluated). 
Almost one third of the 7147 reported AEs belonged to the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders. 
The applicant identified hypersensitivity reactions as a safety signal, conducted a thorough evaluation 
of all relevant data, and consequently updated the SmPC to include hypersensitivity reactions. As 
haemorrhagic events were also considered a validated signal, a full evaluation was also conducted. 
The applicant has at Day 121 submitted Drug Safety Reports concerning hypersensitivity reactions and 
haemorrhagic events. Based on the review of the post-marketing data the Applicant believes that 
baloxavir marboxil is likely to be causally associated with hypersensitivity reactions characterized by 
the features of urticaria, angioedema and anaphylaxis/anaphylactic reaction and recommends an 
update to the company core datasheet. Severe cutaneous reactions, along with other hypersensitivity 
reactions, will continue to be closely monitored via routine signal detection activities. 
Regarding haemorrhagic events: 
Following a close evaluation of the cases received at both an individual case level and in aggregate, the 
data were not considered to suggest a causal association with the use of baloxavir marboxil. No 
additional risk minimization measures are considered required. Events reporting bleeding will continue 
to be evaluated. 
The applicant was asked to update the post-marketing data at the time of responding to the D120 LOQ 
and to re-appraise and justify the content of section 4.8 of the SmPC accordingly. Subsequently, an 
updated evaluation of post-marketing data from all sources for the period 23 August 2019 to 22 
February 2020 has been undertaken to inform the first Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report/Periodic 
Safety Update Report (PBRER/PSUR). Exposure is now estimated to be in excess of 7.2 million patients 
with the majority (approximately 6.8 million) in Japan. It is concluded, that based on the cumulative 
and interval data, no further safety updates are proposed for Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
SmPC 
There are no safety warnings in section 4.4 of the SmPC, apart from those related to excipient 
warnings whilst section 4.3 contraindicates use in patients known to be hypersensitive to baloxavir or 
excipients  
Based on post-marketing data, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity and angioedema 
have been added as ADRs to section 4.8. Based on the clinical trial data, urticaria has been added to 
section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency of uncommon.  
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of baloxavir marboxil in the treatment of influenza has been evaluated in 12 phase 1 studies 
(329 subjects), 2 paediatric studies (140 children < 12 yoa), one phase 2 study in adults (100 
subjects), two phase 3 studies (including 1432 and 2178 subjects, respectively) and in one phase 3 
prophylaxis study (749 subjects). No AEs fulfilling the definition of ADRs were reported in the clinical 
studies. Post marketing data have become available since February 2018, where the product was first 
approved in Japan, and it is estimated that approximately 6 million people have received baloxavir 
marboxil. Due to a number of post marketing reports of hypersensitivity a thorough evaluation of all 
relevant data has resulted in inclusion of hypersensitivity as an ADR in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Furthermore, a full evaluation of haemorrhagic events is ongoing. No safety concerns precluding a 
favourable risk-benefit. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The applicant submitted an updated EU Risk Management Plan for Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil), 
version number 1.1, data lock point for current RMP 22 August 2019, dated 2 October 2020.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.1 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 23.02.2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of baloxavir marboxil with active substances contained in 
authorised medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, 
isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers baloxavir marboxil to be a new active substance as 
it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indications are as follows: 
Xofluza is indicated for the treatment of influenza in patients aged 12 and above, including patients at 
high risk of developing influenza-related complications. 
Xofluza is indicated for the post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in individuals aged 12 and above. 
Influenza is an acute febrile illness caused by infection with influenza type A and/or B viruses that 
occurs in outbreaks of varying severity every winter in temperate climates and year-round in tropical 
climates. Influenza viruses are highly contagious with efficient person-person spread within 
communities and the potential for significant public health challenges due to severe morbidity and 
mortality from both seasonal flu and pandemics. 
Annual influenza epidemics are thought to result in between 3 and 5 million cases of severe illness and 
between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths every year around the world (WHO 2018a). 
Baloxavir marboxil is an anti-influenza virus drug with a novel mechanism of action. The active form 
selectively inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease, an influenza virus-specific enzyme in the 
polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase complex, which thereby inhibits influenza 
virus replication. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Two classes of influenza anti-viral medications have been approved in Europe: M2 blockers and 
neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). Widespread, transmissible resistance has rendered the M2 blockers 
entirely ineffective. NAIs act principally at the end of the viral life cycle to prevent release of the virus 
from the infected cell. This mechanism of action delivers relatively modest antiviral activity. Viral 
replication inhibitors are thought to be more effective than either virus entry or exit inhibitors. A 
simplified dosing regimen (e.g., single oral dose) for influenza anti-viral medications is also desirable 
for patient convenience. This could maximize patient adherence.  
The major public health control measure for prevention of influenza is vaccination and in the overall 
management of influenza, treatment and prevention with anti-influenza virus drugs is not a substitute 
for, but a complement to, vaccination.  
Limitations of influenza vaccines exist, such as the target strains being different from epidemic strains 
or, in the event of a pandemic, an effective vaccine may not be available in the early phase owing to 
the several months’ lead time required to produce such a vaccine. A further limitation is that 
vaccination is contraindicated in some patients. For these reasons, having the option to provide 
treatment and prevention with an anti-influenza virus drug is necessary and especially important in 
populations at high risk of developing influenza-related complications (both hospitalized and 
outpatients). 
There is therefore an unmet need for an easily administered (e.g., single oral dose) antiviral drug with 
good antiviral efficacy and a new mechanism of action−ideally with a high barrier to resistance, but at a 
minimum lacking cross-resistance with NAIs.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Treatment: 
The evidence for treatment efficacy derives from three studies; one phase 2 study and two phase 3 
studies: 
•  1 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, pivotal, Phase 2 studies on the treatment of 
diagnosed influenza in otherwise healthy subjects (OwH).  
•  2 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and comparator controlled, pivotal, Phase 3 
studies on the treatment of diagnosed influenza in otherwise healthy subjects and in patients 
at high-risk of developing complications (HR).  
Treatment was a single dose of baloxavir marboxil initiated within 48 h of influenza onset. The primary 
endpoint was time to recovery in terms of time to alleviation of symptoms (OwH) or improvement of 
symptoms (HR). 
PEP:  
The main evidence of efficacy is a single pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study T0834 in subjects of all ages who were household members of all ages of influenza-infected 
patients with symptoms < 48 hours. Treatment was a single dose baloxavir marboxil. The study was 
conducted in Japan in the 2019/2019 influenza season. With two successful treatment studies, a single 
pivotal PEP study vs. placebo is considered acceptable. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Treatment: 
In the otherwise healthy population, treatment with baloxavir marboxil reduced the time with 
influenza-related symptoms. The median time with influenza symptoms was 54 h (50-59 h) in the 
baloxavir marboxil group as compared to 80 h (73-87 h) in the placebo group. 
Similarly, in the high-risk population, treatment with baloxavir marboxil reduced the time with 
influenza-related symptoms. The median time with influenza symptoms was 73 h (67-85 h) in the 
baloxavir marboxil group as compared to 102 h (93-113 h) in the placebo group. 
The overall faster recovery was also reflected in the secondary endpoints. The time to 
alleviation/improvement of systemic symptoms (headache, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, 
and fatigue), respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat and nasal congestion), and individual 
symptoms (all of the above) was shorter in the baloxavir marboxil group than the placebo group in 
both the otherwise healthy and high-risk populations.  
In the high-risk population, the number of influenza-related complications was decreased in patients 
treated with baloxavir marboxil; 3% (11/388) in baloxavir marboxil group vs. 10% (40/386) in placebo 
group. In addition, the proportion of patients, who received systemic antibiotics for infections 
secondary to influenza infection, was lower in the baloxavir marboxil group; 3% (13/388) in baloxavir 
marboxil group vs. 8% (29/386) in placebo group. 
Finally, the proportion of patients, who had a positive influenza virus titre at each time point after 
treatment initiation, was reduced in the baloxavir groups as compared to the placebo groups in both 
the otherwise healthy and high-risk populations. 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 151/159 
 
 
  
  
 
There was no difference between the baloxavir marboxil and the active comparator, oseltamivir, 
groups. 
PEP:  
A single dose of baloxavir to household members of index patients maintained preventive exposure 
levels for 10 days and a beneficial effect of baloxavir marboxil compared with placebo in the prevention 
of symptomatic influenza infection has been shown in study T0834. The study was effectively a 
measure of prevention of clinically manifest infection with influenza A in parents who were randomised 
within 24 h of onset of disease in paediatric index cases and were negative for influenza (based on RT-
PCR) at baseline. The minority of randomised subjects consisted of paediatric contacts of index cases 
(19%) and less than 5% were aged 65+years.  
A significant lower proportion of subjects were infected with symptomatic influenza (RT-PCR positive 
influenza and symptoms of fever and at least one respiratory symptom during the period) in the 
baloxavir marboxil group compared to the placebo group (1.9% vs. 13.6%; adjusted risk ratio 0.14 
[95% CI: 0.06, 0.30], p < 0.0001). The results of the secondary endpoints with different definitions of 
symptomatic influenza and all supplementary analyses of subgroups (≥12 or < 12 years, anti-influenza 
treatment) were consistent with the result in the overall mITT population.  
A risk reduction of 86 % is considered clinically relevant, and in absolute numbers, the number needed 
to treat to prevent one case of influenza is 9 (ARR= 13.6 – 1.9 = 11,7 %, NNT = 1/ 0.117 = 8.5). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Treatment: 
There is solid evidence for the primary endpoint in both the otherwise healthy and the high-risk 
populations. It was prespecified and adequately tested. 
In comparison, the secondary endpoints were not prioritised before study initiation and the analyses of 
the endpoint were not adjusted for multiple testing. Therefore, the secondary endpoints are considered 
exploratory. Nevertheless, the secondary endpoints, which were predominantly subgroups of the 
primary endpoint (time to resolution headache, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, fatigue, 
cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or viral shedding), all favoured baloxavir marboxil over placebo. 
Similarly, the proportion of patients, who had a positive influenza virus titre at each time point after 
treatment initiation, and the proportion of patients, who received systemic antibiotics for infections 
secondary to influenza infection, in the high-risk population were non-prioritised and non-adjusted for 
multiplicity. Therefore, less emphasis may be put on these results, even though they are plausible in 
the light of the outcome of the primary endpoint. This is regrettable since a reduction of influenza-
related complications is of high clinical relevance.  
Finally, the proposed indication includes a broader population than the one studied in the pivotal 
studies. Specifically, only patients with uncomplicated influenza were included. The indication should 
reflect this. Furthermore, while the selection criteria for high-risk patients generally followed the 
criteria defined by the Centre for Disease Control, not all CDC-listed patient groups were eligible for 
inclusion. Thus, the entire spectrum of high-risk patients was not studied. 
PEP:  
Only results from one single pivotal study are available and numbers of events are small, 7 and 51 
subjects presented with influenza virus infection (RT-PCR positive), fever, and at least one respiratory 
symptom in the baloxavir and placebo group respectively. Retreatment is expected to be uncommon 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 152/159 
 
 
  
  
 
for the Post-exposure prophylaxis and no clinical data are available for the efficacy or safety of 
retreatment in the PEP setting. Therefore, retreatment is not recommended. The maximum interval 
between first contact with the symptomatic index case and intake of baloxavir was 48 hours, efficacy 
beyond this timeframe is not known.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No ADRs (defined as treatment-emergent AE incidence of ≥ 1% in the baloxavir marboxil group and a 
higher incidence than in the placebo group plus medical judgment indicating the AE was likely due to 
the drug) were reported in the three treatment studies or in the post-exposure prophylaxis study.  
A slightly higher incidence of AEs was observed in the HR population compared with the pooled OwH 
population; however, this was the case in all treatment groups. In both populations, the incidence of 
treatment-related AEs was higher in the oseltamivir-group as compared to the baloxavir marboxil 
group. 
The most commonly reported AEs were bronchitis, sinusitis, diarrhoea, nausea, nasopharyngitis, 
seasonal allergy, vertigo, headache, and gastritis. However, the AE-pattern was consistent among 
treatment groups. No AE was reported in ≥ 5% in any treatment group in any study. The majority of 
the AEs were Grade 1-2, and the majority resolved. In Study T0821 no dose-dependent increases in 
AEs were observed. 
No SAEs reported in the pooled OwH studies or in the HR study were treatment-related. One patient in 
the HR study treated with baloxavir died; however, the AE (AMI) had onset prior to study drug 
administration. The severity of AEs was consistent between the OwH and HR populations. In both 
patient populations, the majority of AEs were mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A number of limitations related to the study populations may restrict the possibility to catch all 
potential AEs or other unfavourable effects adhered to baloxavir marboxil: 
In the treatment studies no subject was below 12 year of age (yoa), in the PEP study this was the case 
for 71 subjects. However, the applicant does not apply with this application for an indication in children 
below 12. A paediatric development plan (PIP) including children from birth to < 12 years has been 
approved by the PDCO.  
Only 57 subjects above 75 yoa were exposed to study drug; however, there are no indications of a 
higher risk of AEs among older subjects. 
A number of exclusion criteria were included in the clinical study protocols which inherently imply the 
risk of “missing” some unfavourable effects. Excluded were  
1.  Women who were pregnant or within 2 weeks post-partum; however, Section 4.6 of the SmPC 
advises against the use of baloxavir marboxil during pregnancy, unless the potential benefit for 
the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
2.  Women who were breastfeeding; however, Section 4.6 of the SmPC advises that the potential 
benefit of baloxavir marboxil to the nursing mother and the potential risk to the infant should 
be taken into account. 
3.  Patients who had a severe influenza virus infection requiring inpatient treatment. Due to this 
exclusion criterion it is recommended to amend the indication to read: Treatment of 
uncomplicated influenza ……

It was demonstrated in Study T0821 that the frequency of AEs did not increase with increasing dose.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Compared to placebo, baloxavir marboxil statistically significantly reduced the time with influenza-
related symptoms. The median reduction (compared to placebo) in time with influenza symptoms was 
approximately 24 hours, slightly more for HR than for OwH. This reduction is considered clinically 
relevant and comparable to what is seen for other drugs for this indication. Potentially of greater 
importance is the beneficial effect of baloxavir marboxil on the number of influenza-related 
complications and proportion of patients, who received systemic antibiotics for infections secondary to 
influenza infection, as these secondary endpoints suggest a beneficial effect on the more serious 
consequences of influenza. Although the numerical difference between active and placebo suggests 
that this effect is indeed clinically relevant, the results must be interpreted with caution as the 
analyses of secondary endpoints were not controlled for multiplicity. 
The single PEP study followed on from two successful treatment studies and used the same dose as for 
treatment, which is considered acceptable. The fact that the study was confined to Japan is not a 
concern. Whilst the study included subjects aged <12 years, the majority was aged 12+ years and 
efficacy was shown overall and in the latter group.  
A single dose of baloxavir to household members of index patients maintained preventive exposure 
levels for 10 days.  A significant lower proportion of subjects were infected with symptomatic influenza. 
A risk reduction of 86 % is considered clinically relevant, and in absolute numbers, the number needed 
to treat to prevent one case of influenza is 9 (ARR= 13.6 – 1.9 = 11,7 %, NNT = 1/ 0.117 = 8.5).  
The unfavourable effects of baloxavir marboxil appears to be very limited and clinically manageable. 
No AE was reported in ≥ 5% in any treatment group in any study. The majority of the AEs were Grade 
1-2, and the majority resolved. No AEs fulfilling the definition of ADRs were reported in the clinical 
studies. Post marketing data have become available since February 2018, where the product was first 
approved in Japan, and it is estimated that approximately 7.2 million people have received baloxavir 
marboxil. Due to a number of post marketing reports of hypersensitivity a thorough evaluation of all 
relevant data has resulted in inclusion of hypersensitivity as an ADR in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Furthermore, a full evaluation of haemorrhagic events has been conducted. Data were not considered 
to suggest a causal association with the use of baloxavir marboxil. The information about the safety of 
baloxavir marboxil in pregnant and lactating women as well as children (below the age of 12) and 
elderly (above the age of 65) is currently limited. However, these uncertainties are considered 
manageable if the SmPC includes adequate warnings and restrictions.     
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk balance for the proposed treatment indication is considered positive for both the 
treatment and PEP indication. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xofluza is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Xofluza is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of influenza 
Xofluza is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza in patients aged 12 years and above. 
Post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza 
Xofluza is indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in individuals aged 12 years and above. 
Xofluza should be used in accordance with official recommendations. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit aperiodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
EMA/CHMP/537088/2020 
Page 158/159 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that baloxavir marboxil is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

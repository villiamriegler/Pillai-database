 For Micardis, Micardis Plus, Kinzalmono, kinzalkomb, 
Pritor, Pritor Plus 
- Inconsistency between SmPC section 4.5 and PIL 
regarding interaction with alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or 
antidepressants  
- Inconsistency between SmPC section 4.2 and PIL 
regarding the storage recommendation.  
For Twynsta, Onduarp

with regard to the side effect hyperglycaemia (amlodipine 
component) 
For Micardis Plus, Kinzalkomb, Pritor Plus 
In the PIL section 2, there is a different wording of 
telmisartan mono products compared to the 
telmisartan/HCTZ products for the explanation of 
cholestasis or biliary obstruction. The MAH proposes

wording concerning the use of hydrochlorothiazide in 
combination with angiotensin II receptor antagonists during 
pregnancy and breast-feeding as per the recommendation 
and wording agreed by PhVWP and CHMP in June 2011. 
In particular, with this variation the MAH added information 
on the limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during 
pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. In addition 
the MAH added that hydrochlorothiazide crosses the 
placenta and its use during the second and third trimester 
may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause 
foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of 
electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. The updated of 
the SmPC includes that hydrochlorothiazide should not be 
used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except 
in rare situations where no other treatment could be used.

the SPC, upon request by CHMP following the assessment 
of PSUR 9, to add further information about 'liver disorder' 
and to add the ADR 'hypoglycaemia' under post-marketing 
experience.  
Most cases of abnormal liver function / liver disorder from 
post-marketing experience occurred in Japanese patients. 
The product information has now been updated to reflect 
the fact that Japanese patients are more likely to 
experience these adverse reactions.  
Post-marketing experience with telmisartan has identified 
hypoglycaemia as a new side effect which occurs mainly in 
diabetic patients and patients with abnormal glucose 
tolerance. Based on the statistically significant number of 
hypoglycaemia reports from pooled clinical trials in 
hypertensive patients suffering from diabetes, and the 
cardiovascular outcome trial TRANSCEND, a direct causal 
relationship between the occurrence of hypoglycaemia in 
diabetic patients and the therapeutic use of telmisartan 
cannot be excluded.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update Annex 
II with the standard DDPS wording and to make changes to 
the SPC to bring it in line with the latest version of the SPC

Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system:  
Package Leaflet 
This type II variation concerns an update of section 
4.4 of the SPC to include a warning on the use of 
dual RAAS blockade and section 4.5 of the SPC to 
include information on the interaction with ramipril.  
Further, a minor change has been made to section 
4.8 of the SPC to delete the term 'ineffectiveness of 
telmisartan'. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make minor editorial changes to the 
SPC and Package Leaflet and to update the list of 
local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, hypotension, syncope, hyperkalaemia, 
and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) 
have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if 
combining medicinal products that affect this system. Dual 
blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. 
by adding an ACE-inhibitor to an angiotensin II receptor 
antagonist) is therefore not recommended in patients with 
already controlled blood pressure and should be limited to 
individually defined cases with close monitoring of renal 
function.

Inteaction with ramipril: 
In one study the co-administration of telmisartan and 
ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the AUC0-24 
and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance 
of this observation is not known. 
The term 'drug ineffective' currently labelled as an adverse 
drug reaction observed with telmisartan mono therapy is 
not substantiated from clinical trial data or from post 
marketing experience, and has therefore been deleted from 
section 4.8 of the SPC.

who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of 
sepsis was noted for telmisartan compared with placebo, 
0.70 % vs. 0.49 % [RR 1.43 (95 % confidence interval

increased for patients taking telmisartan (0.33 %) vs. 
patients taking placebo (0.16 %) [RR 2.07 (95 % 
confidence interval 1.14 - 3.76)]. The observed increased 
occurrence rate of sepsis associated with the use of 
telmisartan may be either a chance finding or related to a 
mechanism not currently known. The term "sepsis including

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
have been assessed. There are no concrete data to support 
the contraindication of use of AIIRAs during breast-feeding. 
All AIIRA agents were found in the milk of lactating rats but 
no human data about their transfer into breast milk are 
available. There is only a theoretical presumption of low 
transport according to their high plasma protein binding 
and low oral availability. A harmonised wording 
recommending an alternative treatment with better 
established safety profiles during breast-feeding, especially 
while nursing a newborn or preterm infant, has been 
included in section 4.6 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL. 
Consequently, the existing contraindication for lactation has

undesirable effects taking into account adverse drug 
reactions instead of adverse events. Furthermore, the basis 
for the frequency estimation (i.e. the number of patients 
treated in eligible clinical trials with 
telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide) has continuously grown 
since 2005. For the calculation of frequencies clinical trials 
have been included with a minimum treatment duration of 
8 weeks. Therefore all randomised and double-blind clinical

requisite and which listed adverse events and reactions by 
individual patients (i.e. patient by patient basis) were 
identified and 9 clinical trials served as the basis for the 
frequency estimation of side effects of telmisartan + 
hydrochlorothiazide. 
Regarding SPC section 4.9 the information so far stated 
that "no data are available for telmisartan with regard to 
overdose in humans". However, several mostly 
spontaneous reports of overdoses had been received by the 
MAH, and consequently SPC section 4.9 has been revised.

identified a signal of increased risk of congenital 
malformations, particularly cardiac defects after exposure 
to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Since the role of confounding factors such as diabetes and 
hypertension cannot be accurately defined based on the 
available data, the teratogenic potential of ACE inhibitors is 
not demonstrated, even though data suggest that such 
exposure cannot be considered as safe and should be 
avoided. 
There are fewer data regarding the risks associated with 
first trimester exposure to Angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists (AIIRAs) than for ACE inhibitors. Nevertheless, 
there is no evidence that the risk is lower for AIIRAs, and it 
is considered that any conclusions on ACE inhibitors are 
also valid for AIIRAs. 
Therefore, the existing contraindication for the 2nd and 3rd

between NSAIDs and angiotensin II antagonists has been 
and PL 
added to section 4.5 of the SPC: 
"NSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory 
dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective 
NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and 
antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics and the 
antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II antagonists. 
In some patients with compromised renal function (eg 
dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised 
renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II 
antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may 
result in further deterioration of renal function, including 
possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. 
Therefore the combination should be administered with 
caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be 
adequately hydrated and consideration shoul be given to 
monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant 
therapy and periodically thereafter." 
In addition, minor changes have been introduced in the

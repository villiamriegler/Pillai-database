CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.  
Adjupanrix should be used in accordance with official guidance. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Adults from the age of 18 years 
One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. 
A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks and up to twelve 
months after the first dose for maximum efficacy.  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on very limited data, adults aged >80 years may require a double dose of Adjupanrix on an 
elected date and again after an interval of at least three weeks in order to achieve an immune response 
(see section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
Children aged 6 months to <36 months: 
One dose of 0.125 ml (equals quarter the adult dose per injection) at an elected date. 
A second dose of 0.125 ml at least three weeks after the first dose for maximum efficacy. 
Children and adolescents aged 36 months to <18 years: 
One dose of 0.25 ml (equals half the adult dose per injection) at an elected date. 
A second dose of 0.25 ml at least three weeks after the first dose for maximum efficacy. 
Children aged <6 months: 
The safety and efficacy of Adjupanrix in children less than 6 months have not been established. 
Method of administration 
Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection. 
If a double dose is given, the injections should be given into opposite limbs preferably into the deltoid 
muscle or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). 
For instructions on mixing of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues 
(egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate) of 
this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided 
that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. See section 4.4. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be 
readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other 
than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to 
thiomersal and to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate 
and sodium deoxycholate). 
Concurrent illness 
If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile 
illness or acute infection. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
Adjupanrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. There are no data with 
Adjupanrix using the subcutaneous route.  Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits 
and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the 
risk of bleedings. 
Protection 
There are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of 
influenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use. 
Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. 
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). 
Syncope 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to 
the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that 
procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
Narcolepsy 
Epidemiological studies relating to another AS03-adjuvanted vaccine (Pandemrix H1N1, also 
manufactured in the same facility as Adjupanrix), in several European countries have indicated an 
increased risk of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in vaccinated as compared with unvaccinated 
individuals. In children/adolescents (aged up to 20 years), these studies have indicated an additional 
1.4 to 8 cases in 100 000 vaccinated subjects. Available epidemiological data in adults aged over 20 
years have indicated approximately 1 additional case per 100 000 vaccinated subjects. These data 
suggest that the excess risk tends to decline with increasing age at vaccination.  Narcolepsy has not 
been observed in clinical trials with Adjupanrix, however clinical trials are not powered to detect very 
rare adverse events with incidence rates as low as narcolepsy (≈ 1.1/100,000 Person-Years). 
Paediatric population 
Clinical data in children less than 6 years of age who received two doses of pandemic preparedness 
influenza vaccine (H5N1) indicate an increase in frequency of fever (axillary≥38°C) after the 
administration of the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and measures to lower the 
fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are recommended in young 
children (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) post-vaccination. 
Sodium and potassium content 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
There are no data on co-administration of Adjupanrix with other vaccines. If co-administration with 
another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be 
noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. 
The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant 
treatment. 
Following influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA 
method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, 
HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results 
may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. 
4.6   Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

Pregnancy 
There are currently no data available on the use of Adjupanrix in pregnancy.  
An AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v has been administered to women in each 
trimester of pregnancy.  Information on outcomes from estimated more than 200 000 women who 
have been vaccinated during pregnancy is currently limited. There was no evidence of an increased 
risk of adverse outcomes in over 100 pregnancies that were followed in a prospective clinical study. 
Animal studies with Adjupanrix do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do 
not suggest malformations or foetal or neonatal toxicity. 
The use of Adjupanrix may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking 
into account official recommendations.  
Breast-feeding 
Adjupanrix may be used in lactating women. 
Fertility 
No fertility data are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive 
or operate machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Clinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions listed below in approximately 5 000 
subjects 18 years old and above who received formulations of H5N1 vaccine containing 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) strain with at least 3.75 microgram HA/AS03. 
Two clinical studies evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions in approximately 824 children aged 3 
to <18 years who received half the adult dose, 0.25 mL, containing A/Indonesia/2005 (H5N1) strain 
with at least 1.9 microgram HA/AS03. 
Three clinical studies evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions in approximately 437 children aged 
6 months to <36 months who received either half the adult dose (n=400), 0.25 mL, or a quarter adult 
dose, 0.125 mL (n=37).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code: J07BB02. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
This section describes the clinical experience with the pandemic preparedness vaccines.  
Pandemic preparedness vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the 
currently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as “novel” antigens and 
simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data 
obtained with the pandemic preparedness vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to 
be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained 
with pandemic preparedness vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines.   
Adults  
Adults aged 18-60 years 
In clinical studies that evaluated the immunogenicity of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg 
HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in subjects aged 18-60 years the anti-haemagglutinin (anti-HA)

At day 180, the seroprotection rate was 13%. 
A 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody titres against A/Vietnam was obtained in 49% of 
subjects twenty-one days after the first dose, 67.3% twenty-one days after the second dose and 44.9% 
six months after the second dose. 
Alternative schedules 
An extended dosing interval was investigated in study D-H5N1-012 in which a group of subjects 18-
60 years of age received two doses of Adjupanrix 6 months or 12 months apart. Twenty-one days after 
the second dose, the seroprotection rate and the vaccine response rate against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in 
subjects who received the vaccine 6 months apart were 89.6% and 95.7%, respectively. Twenty-one 
days after the second dose, the seroprotection rate and the vaccine response rate in subjects who 
received the vaccine 12 months apart were 92.0% and 100%, respectively. 
In this study, cross-reactive immune responses against A/Indonesia/5/2005 were also observed. 
Twenty-one days after the second dose, the seroprotection rate and the vaccine response rate in 
subjects who received the vaccine 6 months apart were 83.3% and 100%, respectively. Twenty-one 
days after the second dose, the seroprotection rate and the vaccine response rate in subjects who 
received the vaccine 12 months apart were 84.0% and 100%, respectively.

Regardless of whether one or two doses of priming vaccine had been given 6 months earlier, the 
seroprotection rates against A/Indonesia were >80% after a dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine 
containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and the seroprotection rates against 
A/Vietnam were >90% after a dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from 
A/Indonesia/05/2005. All subjects achieved a neutralising antibody titre of at least 1:80 against each of 
the two strains regardless of the HA type in the vaccine and the previous number of doses. 
In another clinical study (D-Pan-H5N1-015), 39 subjects aged 18-60 years received a dose of AS03-
adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/5/2005 fourteen months after 
they had received two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from 
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 administered on day 0 and day 21. The seroprotection rate against A/Indonesia 
21 days after booster vaccination was 92% and 69.2% at day 180. 
In another clinical study (D-Pan-H5N1-038), 387 subjects aged 18-60 years received 1 dose of AS03-
adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/5/2005 36 months after they had 
received two doses of A/Vietnam/1194/2004. The seroprotection rate, booster seroconversion rate and 
booster factor against A/Indonesia/5/2005 21 days after booster vaccination was 100%, 99.7% and 
123.8, respectively.

Similar immunogenicity results for the primary vaccination were obtained in a clinical study (D-PAN-
H5N1-009) conducted in 102 children 3 to 5 and 6 to 9 years of age who received 2 doses of 0.25 ml 
of Adjupanrix containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004. Furthermore, this study evaluated persistence against 
homologous A/Vietnam/1194/2004 up to 24 months after the second dose. The seroconversion rate 
was 38.3% for 3-5 year olds and 22.9% for 6-9 year olds at Month 24. Cross-reactive antibody 
responses against the heterologous strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 were also observed and, although 
declining persisted up to 24 months after the second dose. 
Information from non-clinical studies: 
The ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous vaccine strains was assessed 
non-clinically using ferret challenge models. 
In each experiment, four groups of six ferrets were immunised intramuscularly with an AS03 
adjuvanted vaccine containing HA derived from H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 (NIBRG-14). Doses of 15, 
5, 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms of HA were tested in the homologous challenge experiment, and doses of 15, 
7.5, 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms of HA were tested in the heterologous challenge experiment. Control 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
groups included ferrets immunized with adjuvant alone, non-adjuvanted vaccine (15 micrograms HA) 
or phosphate buffered saline solution. Ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the 
intra-tracheal route on day 49 with a lethal dose of either H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 or heterologous 
H5N1/A/Indonesia/5/05. Of the animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine, 87% and 96% were protected 
against the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge, respectively. Viral shedding into the upper 
respiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk 
of viral transmission. In the unadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant control group, all 
animals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of 
challenge.

6.5  Nature and contents of container  
One pack containing: 
- 
- 
one pack of 50 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml suspension with a stopper (butyl rubber). 
two packs of 25 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml emulsion with a stopper (butyl rubber). 
The volume after mixing 1 vial of suspension (2.5 ml) with 1 vial of emulsion (2.5 ml) corresponds to 
10 doses of vaccine (5 ml). 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling  
Adjupanrix consists of two containers:  
Suspension: multidose vial containing the antigen,  
Emulsion: multidose vial containing the adjuvant.  
Prior to administration, the two components should be mixed. 
Instructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be 
allowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken 
and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. 
In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), do not mix 
the vaccine. 
The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by 
means of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended 
to equip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be 
available, a 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained 
in upside down position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content.  
After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed 
vaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion. In the event of other 
variation being observed, do not administer the vaccine. 
The volume of the Adjupanrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be 
administered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 4.2). 
The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign 
particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed 
(including rubber particles from the stopper), do not administer the vaccine. 
Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml or 0.25 ml or 0.125 ml is withdrawn into a syringe with appropriate 
graduation for injection and administered intramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the 
syringe with a needle gauge not larger than 23-G.  
After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a 
refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25°C. If the mixed vaccine is 
18

C.   OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING 
AUTHORISATION 
• 
Periodic safety update reports (PSURs)  
The requirements for submission of PSURs for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union 
reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Outside of the pandemic period, the normal PSUR periodicity and format will be maintained, with a 
specific review of AESI and possible adverse events related to adjuvants. This should include data 
from ongoing studies, or actual use if applicable, of the pandemic preparedness strains and any safety 
data relevant to the adjuvant system. 
In order to effectively monitor  the safety profile of Adjupanrix during an officially-declared H5N1 
influenza pandemic, GSK Biologicals will prepare monthly simplified PSURs, accompanied by a 
summary of vaccine distribution, as described in the CHMP recommendations for PhV plans of 
pandemic influenza vaccines (EMEA/359381/2009). The preparation and submission of the safety 
reports are described below. 
Objectives of the simplified PSUR 
The objectives of the simplified PSUR, as indicated by CHMP, include the following: 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
To notify regulatory authorities of the AERs that have been received within a pre-specified time 
period and that may have the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic; 
To flag any preliminary safety concerns and prioritise them for further evaluation within an 
appropriate timeframe. 
Frequency of submission 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The clock will start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine. 
First data-lock point is 28 days later. 
Report submission will be no later than day 43 (15 days after data-lock point), as agreed with 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) during the H1N1 influenza pandemic, because Day 14 
after data-lock point will always fall on a Sunday- Reports will be submitted monthly for the 
first 6 months of the pandemic. 
Periodicity will be reviewed by the GSK Biologicals and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 6-month 
intervals. 
Format of the simplified PSUR 
The report will include the following tables of aggregate data, using the format specified in the CHMP 
recommendations (EMEA/359381/2009) in the order listed below: 
1. 
2. 
An overview for all spontaneous reports per country, stratified according to type of report 
(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed) and seriousness, for the period covered by 
the report and cumulatively.  
An overview for all spontaneous adverse events by SOC, High Level Term (HLT) and Preferred 
Term (PT), stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically 
confirmed) and including the number of fatal reports, for the period covered by the report and 
cumulatively. 
3. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed or 
non-medically confirmed). AESIs will be defined as follows:

Serious unlisted adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PTs) stratified according to type of report 
(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered by the report and 
cumulatively. 
All spontaneous adverse reactions by age group, per SOC, HLT and PT, stratified according to 
type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period covered by the 
report and cumulatively. The following age groups will be used: < 2 years, 2-8 years, > 9 years, 
and age unknown. 
All spontaneous adverse reactions (SOC, HLT, PT) occurring in pregnant women, stratified 
according to type of report (medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed), for the period

The following principles will be followed when compiling the data: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Table 1 of the PSUR will be based on the number of reports, while all other tables will be based 
on number of reactions (presented on PT level, sorted by SOC and HLT).  
All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data, based on the assumption that 
product name will not be provided in a significant proportion of cases. Product-specific data 
will be evaluated during signal evaluation.  
“Cumulatively” means all adverse events since the use of the vaccine. 
All non-medically confirmed events will be those that had been entered into GSK’s worldwide 
clinical safety database (referred to as ARGUS) by the data-lock point. Those which have not 
yet been entered will be reported in the following PSURs.  
“Serious” refers to the seriousness using regulatory criteria based on outcomes; this definition 
will be used in all tables. 
CIOMS I forms for fatal cases and reports of GBS will be provided in annexes. 
A short summary will be provided in which the total number of new AERs since the last simplified 
PSUR will be outlined and validated signals and areas of concern will be highlighted, signal 
evaluation prioritised (in the event of multiple signals), and appropriate timelines for submission of a 
full signal evaluation report provided. 
Signals occurring in pregnant women will be summarised in a table that will include the following 
data elements: gestational age at time of vaccination, gestational age at time of occurrence of adverse 
event, adverse event, and outcome. 
Vaccine distribution report 
To put the safety report into context, a summary of vaccine distribution will be included and will 
provide details of the number of doses of vaccine distributed in 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
EU member states for the reporting period by batch number, 
EU member states cumulatively and 
the rest of the world.

1.  What Adjupanrix is and what it is used for  
What Adjupanrix is and what it is used for 
Adjupanrix is a vaccine for use in prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic 
situation. 
Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many 
decades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of 
ordinary flu but may be more serious. 
How Adjupanrix works 
When a person is given the vaccine, the body’s natural defence system (immune system) produces its 
own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. 
As with all vaccines, Adjupanrix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Adjupanrix  
Adjupanrix should not be given 
• 
If you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of this 
vaccine (listed in section 6) or to anything else that may be present in very small amounts, such 
as: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or 
sodium deoxycholate.  
- 
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling 
of the face or tongue.  
-  However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as 
medical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. 
Do not have Adjupanrix if any of the above apply to you.   
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warning and precautions: 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Adjupanrix  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any 
ingredient of Adjupanrix (listed in section 6) or to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, 
ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or to sodium deoxycholate. 
if you have a serious infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then 
your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as 
a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you could still be vaccinated 
with Adjupanrix. 
if you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be 
poor. 
if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first 
few weeks after vaccination with Adjupanrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell 
the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently received Adjupanrix. 
you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. 
Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if 
you fainted with a previous injection. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having 
Adjupanrix. This is because the vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed. 
Children <6 years of age 
If your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after 
the second dose, especially temperature over 38°C. Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures 
to lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each 
dose are recommended. 
Other medicines and Adjupanrix 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or 
have recently received any other vaccine. 
In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are having any treatments (such as corticosteroid 
treatments or chemotherapy for cancer) that affect the immune system. Adjupanrix can still be given 
but your response to the vaccine may be poor. 
Adjupanrix is not intended to be given at the same time as some other vaccines. However, if this needs 
to happen, the other vaccine will be injected into the other arm. Any side effects that happen may be 
more serious.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this vaccine. 
Driving and using machines  
Some side effects listed in Section 4. “Possible side effects” may affect your ability to drive or use 
tools or machines. It is best to see how Adjupanrix affects you before you try these activities. 
Adjupanrix contains thiomersal  
Adjupanrix contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic 
reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies. 
Adjupanrix contains sodium and potassium 
Adjupanrix contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per 
dose. It is essentially sodium- and potassium-free.

How Adjupanrix is given  
Adults aged 18 years and above 
• 
From 18 years onwards: you will receive two doses of Adjupanrix (each 0.5 ml). The second 
dose should be given after an interval of at least three weeks and up to twelve months after the

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Adjupanrix consists of two containers:  
Suspension: multidose vial containing the antigen,  
Emulsion: multidose vial containing the adjuvant.  
Prior to administration, the two components should be mixed. 
Instructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine: 
1. 
Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be 
allowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken 
and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.

7. 
In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), do not mix 
the vaccine. 
The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by 
means of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended 
to equip the syringe with a 23-G needle. However, in the case this needle size would not be 
available, a 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained 
in upside down position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content.  
After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed 
vaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion. In the event of other 
variation being observed, do not administer the vaccine. 
The volume of the Adjupanrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be 
administered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 3 “How Adjupanrix is 
given”). 
The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign 
particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed 
(including rubber particles from the stopper), do not administer the vaccine. 
Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml or 0.25 ml or 0.125 ml is withdrawn into a syringe with appropriate 
graduation for injection and administered intramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the 
syringe with a needle gauge not larger than 23-G. 
After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a 
refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25°C. If the mixed vaccine is 
stored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 
minutes) before each withdrawal. 
The vaccine should not be administered intravascularly. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

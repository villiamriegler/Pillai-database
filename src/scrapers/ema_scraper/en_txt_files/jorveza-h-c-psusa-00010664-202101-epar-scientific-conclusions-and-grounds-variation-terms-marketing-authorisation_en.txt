Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for budesonide (centrally authorised 
products only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on angioedema risk from clinical trials, literature, spontaneous reports including 
cases of positive re-challenge and de–challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC 
considers causal relationship between budesonide (centrally authorised products only) and angioedema is 
at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing 
budesonide (centrally authorised products only) should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for budesonide (centrally authorised products only) the CHMP 
is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing budesonide 
(centrally authorised products only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product 
information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

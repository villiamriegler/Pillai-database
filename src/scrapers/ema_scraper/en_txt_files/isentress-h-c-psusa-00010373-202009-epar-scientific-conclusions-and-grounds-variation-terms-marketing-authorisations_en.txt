Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for raltegravir, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on the risk of DDI with iron salts, including the publication from Rajesh 2016, 
and James et al 2020, and as per other INSTIs and other metal cations such as aluminium or 
magnesium (for which co-administration is not recommended), the PRAC Rapporteur considers that 
there is a risk of drug-drug interaction with iron salts, which is also a metal cation, and consequently a 
potential risk of virologic failure because of the relatively low genetic barrier for RTG. It is therefore 
recommended that the product information of products containing raltegravir is amended to 
recommend staggered administration as a risk minimisation measure. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for raltegravir the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing raltegravir is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

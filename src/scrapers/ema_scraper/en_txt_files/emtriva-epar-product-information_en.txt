CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Emtriva is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of 
human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected adults and children aged 4 months and over. 
This indication is based on studies in treatment-naïve patients and treatment-experienced patients with 
stable virological control.  There is no experience of the use of Emtriva in patients who are failing 
their current regimen or who have failed multiple regimens (see section 5.1). 
When deciding on a new regimen for patients who have failed an antiretroviral regimen, careful 
consideration should be given to the patterns of mutations associated with different medicinal products 
and the treatment history of the individual patient.  Where available, resistance testing may be 
appropriate. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Posology 
Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules may be taken with or without food. 
Adults: The recommended dose of Emtriva is one 200 mg hard capsule, taken orally, once daily. 
If a patient misses a dose of Emtriva within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should 
take Emtriva with or without food as soon as possible and resume their normal dosing schedule.  If a 
patient misses a dose of Emtriva by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for their next dose, the 
patient should not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. 
If the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Emtriva, another dose should be taken.  If the patient 
vomits more than 1 hour after taking Emtriva they do not need to take another dose.

Special populations 
Elderly: There are no safety and efficacy data available in patients over the age of 65 years.  However, 
no adjustment in the recommended daily dose for adults should be required unless there is evidence of 
renal insufficiency. 
Renal insufficiency: Emtricitabine is eliminated by renal excretion and exposure to emtricitabine was 
significantly increased in patients with renal insufficiency (see section 5.2).  Dose or dose interval 
adjustment is required in all patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (see section 4.4). 
Table 1 below provides dose interval adjustment guidelines for the 200 mg hard capsules according to 
the degree of renal insufficiency.  The safety and efficacy of the dose interval adjustments to every 72 
or 96 hours in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min have not been clinically evaluated.  
Therefore, clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these 
patients (see section 4.4). 
Patients with renal insufficiency can also be managed by administration of Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral 
solution to provide a reduced daily dose of emtricitabine.  Please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) managed with other forms of dialysis such as 
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis have not been studied and no dose recommendations can be made. 
Hepatic insufficiency: No data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients 
with hepatic insufficiency.  However, based on the minimal metabolism of emtricitabine and the renal 
route of elimination it is unlikely that a dose adjustment would be required in patients with hepatic 
insufficiency (see section 5.2). 
If Emtriva is discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV), these patients 
should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population: The recommended dose of Emtriva for children aged 4 months and over and 
adolescents up to 18 years of age weighing at least 33 kg who are able to swallow hard capsules is one 
200 mg hard capsule, taken orally, once daily. 
There are no data regarding the efficacy and only very limited data regarding the safety of 
emtricitabine in infants below 4 months of age.  Therefore Emtriva is not recommended for use in 
those aged less than 4 months (for pharmacokinetic data in this age group, see section 5.2). 
No data are available on which to make a dose recommendation in paediatric patients with renal 
insufficiency. 
Method of administration 
Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules should be taken once daily, orally with or without food.

Emtriva is also available as a 10 mg/mL oral solution for use in infants aged 4 months and over, 
children and patients who are unable to swallow hard capsules and patients with renal insufficiency.  
Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution.  Due to a 
difference in the bioavailability of emtricitabine between the hard capsule and oral solution 
presentations, 240 mg emtricitabine administered as the oral solution should provide similar plasma 
levels to those observed after administration of one 200 mg emtricitabine hard capsule (see 
section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Emtricitabine is not recommended as monotherapy for the treatment of HIV infection.  It must be used 
in combination with other antiretrovirals.  Please also refer to the Summaries of Product 
Characteristics of the other antiretroviral medicinal products used in the combination regimen. 
Co-administration of other medicinal products 
Emtriva should not be taken with any other medicinal products containing emtricitabine or medicinal 
products containing lamivudine. 
Opportunistic infections 
Patients receiving emtricitabine or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop 
opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under 
close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated 
diseases. 
Renal function 
Emtricitabine is principally eliminated by the kidney via glomerular filtration and active tubular 
secretion.  Emtricitabine exposure may be markedly increased in patients with severe renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) receiving daily doses of 200 mg emtricitabine as 
hard capsules or 240 mg as the oral solution.  Consequently, either a dose interval adjustment (using 
Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules) or a reduction in the daily dose of emtricitabine (using Emtriva 
10 mg/mL oral solution) is required in all patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min.  The safety 
and efficacy of the dose interval adjustment guidelines provided in section 4.2 are based on single 
dose pharmacokinetic data and modelling and have not been clinically evaluated.  Therefore, clinical 
response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in patients treated with 
emtricitabine at prolonged dosing intervals (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Caution should be exercised when emtricitabine is co-administered with medicinal products that are 
eliminated by active tubular secretion as such co-administration may lead to an increase in serum 
concentrations of either emtricitabine or a co-administered medicinal product, due to competition for 
this elimination pathway (see section 4.5). 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Liver function 
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased 
frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and 
should be monitored according to standard practice.  Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C infection 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with CART are at increased risk of experiencing severe, and potentially fatal, hepatic adverse 
events.  In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please also refer to the relevant 
Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. 
If there is evidence of exacerbations of liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of 
treatment must be considered. 
Patients co-infected with HBV 
Emtricitabine is active in vitro against HBV.  However, limited data are available on the efficacy and 
safety of emtricitabine (as a 200 mg hard capsule once daily) in patients who are co-infected with HIV 
and HBV.  The use of emtricitabine in patients with chronic HBV induces the same mutation pattern 
in the YMDD motif observed with lamivudine therapy.  The YMDD mutation confers resistance to 
both emtricitabine and lamivudine. 
Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory 
follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with emtricitabine for evidence of 
exacerbations of hepatitis.  Such exacerbations have been seen following discontinuation of 
emtricitabine treatment in HBV infected patients without concomitant HIV infection and have been 
detected primarily by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations in addition to re-emergence of 
HBV DNA.  In some of these patients, HBV reactivation was associated with more severe liver 
disease, including decompensation and liver failure.  There is insufficient evidence to determine 
whether re-initiation of emtricitabine alters the course of post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis.  In 
patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since 
post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero 
Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most 
pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these 
have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders 
(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological 
disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such 
neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be 
considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical 
findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current 
national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV. 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause 
serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed 
within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include 
cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis 
jirovecii pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when 
necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint 
stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
Elderly 
Emtriva has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more likely to have 
decreased renal function; therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients with 
Emtriva. 
Paediatric population 
In addition to the adverse reactions experienced by adults, anaemia and skin discolouration occurred 
more frequently in clinical trials involving HIV infected paediatric patients (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
In vitro, emtricitabine did not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following human CYP450 
isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4.  Emtricitabine did not inhibit the enzyme 
responsible for glucuronidation.  Based on the results of these in vitro experiments and the known 
elimination pathways of emtricitabine, the potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving 
emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low. 
There are no clinically significant interactions when emtricitabine is co-administered with indinavir, 
zidovudine, stavudine, famciclovir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.  With the 
exception of famciclovir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the effect of co-administration of 
emtricitabine with medicinal products that are excreted by the renal route, or other medicinal products 
known to affect renal function, has not been evaluated.  Co-administration of emtricitabine with 
medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may lead to an increase in serum 
concentrations of either emtricitabine or a co-administered medicinal product due to competition for 
this elimination pathway. 
There is no clinical experience as yet on the co-administration of cytidine analogues.  Consequently, 
the use of emtricitabine in combination with lamivudine for the treatment of HIV infection cannot be 
recommended at this time. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300 and1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate 
no malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine.  Animal studies do not 
indicate reproductive toxicity.  The use of emtricitabine may be considered during pregnancy, if 
necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
Emtricitabine has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the 
effects of emtricitabine in newborns/infants.  Therefore Emtriva should not be used during breast-
feeding. 
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of emtricitabine are available.  Animal studies do not indicate harmful 
effects of emtricitabine on fertility.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, 
patients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with emtricitabine. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials of HIV infected adults, the most frequently occurring adverse reactions to 
emtricitabine were diarrhoea (14.0%), headache (10.2%), elevated creatine kinase (10.2%) and nausea 
(10.0%).  In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anaemia (9.5%) and skin 
discolouration (31.8%) occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving HIV infected paediatric 
patients. 
Discontinuation of Emtriva therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with 
severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
Assessment of adverse reactions from clinical study data is based on experience in three studies in 
adults (n = 1,479) and three paediatric studies (n = 169).  In the adult studies, 1,039 treatment-naïve 
and 440 treatment-experienced patients received emtricitabine (n = 814) or comparator medicinal 
product (n = 665) for 48 weeks in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. 
The adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment in adults from clinical 
trial and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 2 below by body system organ class and 
frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) or 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100).

General disorders and administration site conditions: 
Common: 
1 See section 4.8, Description of selected adverse reactions for more details. 
2 Anaemia was common and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common when emtricitabine was 
administered to paediatric patients (see section 4.8, Paediatric population). 
3 This adverse reaction, which was identified through post-marketing surveillance, was not observed in randomised 
controlled clinical trials in adults or paediatric HIV clinical trials of emtricitabine.  The frequency category of uncommon 
was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to emtricitabine in these clinical 
studies (n = 1,563). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Skin discolouration (increased pigmentation): Skin discolouration, manifested by hyperpigmentation 
mainly on the palms and/or soles, was generally mild, asymptomatic and of little clinical significance.  
The mechanism is unknown. 
Metabolic parameters: Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during 
antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time 
of initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections 
may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been 
reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many 
months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis: Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally 
acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of 
this is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Assessment of adverse reactions in paediatric patients from clinical study data is based on experience 
in three paediatric studies (n = 169) where treatment-naïve (n = 123) and treatment-experienced 
(n = 46) paediatric HIV infected patients aged 4 months to 18 years were treated with emtricitabine in 
combination with other antiretroviral agents. 
In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults (see section 4.8, Tabulated summary of adverse 
reactions), the following adverse reactions were observed more frequently in paediatric patients: 
anaemia was common (9.5%) and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common 
(31.8%) in paediatric patients. 
Other special population(s) 
Elderly: Emtriva has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more likely 
to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients 
with Emtriva (see section 4.2). 
Patients with renal impairment: Emtricitabine is eliminated by renal excretion and exposure to 
emtricitabine was significantly increased in patients with renal insufficiency.  Dose or dose interval 
adjustment is required in all patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.2). 
HIV/HBV co-infected patients: The adverse reaction profile in patients co-infected with HBV is 
similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV without co-infection with HBV.  However, as 
would be expected in this patient population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently 
than in the general HIV infected population. 
Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: In HIV infected patients co-infected 
with HBV, exacerbations of hepatitis may occur after discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Administration of up to 1,200 mg emtricitabine has been associated with the adverse reactions listed 
above (see section 4.8). 
If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored for signs of toxicity and standard supportive 
treatment applied as necessary. 
Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose can be removed by haemodialysis.  It is not known whether 
emtricitabine can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, ATC code: 
J05AF09 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of cytidine with activity that is specific to HIV-1, 
HIV-2 and HBV. 
Emtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5’-triphosphate, which 
competitively inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain termination.  Emtricitabine 
is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerase α, β and ε and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. 
Emtricitabine did not exhibit cytotoxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), established 
lymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage cell lines or bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro.  There was 
no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro or in vivo. 
Antiviral activity in vitro: The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for emtricitabine against 
laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was in the range of 0.0013 to 0.5 µmol/l.  In combination 
studies of emtricitabine with protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside, nucleotide and non-nucleoside 
analogue inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase, additive to synergistic effects were observed.  Most 
of these combinations have not been studied in humans. 
When tested for activity against laboratory strains of HBV, the IC50 value for emtricitabine was in the 
range of 0.01 to 0.04 µmol/l. 
Resistance: HIV-1 resistance to emtricitabine develops as the result of changes at codon 184 causing 
the methionine to be changed to a valine (an isoleucine intermediate has also been observed) of the 
HIV reverse transcriptase.  This HIV-1 mutation was observed in vitro and in HIV-1 infected patients. 
Emtricitabine-resistant viruses were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained sensitivity to other 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (zidovudine, stavudine, tenofovir, abacavir and 
didanosine), all non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and all PIs.  Viruses 
resistant to zidovudine, didanosine and NNRTIs retained their sensitivity to emtricitabine 
(IC50 = 0.002 µmol/l to 0.08 µmol/l). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Emtricitabine in combination with other antiretroviral agents, including nucleoside analogues, 
non-nucleoside analogues and PIs, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of HIV infection in 
treatment-naïve patients and treatment-experienced patients with stable virological control.  There is 
no experience of the use of emtricitabine in patients who are failing their current regimen or who have 
failed multiple regimens. 
In antiretroviral treatment-naïve adults, emtricitabine was significantly superior to stavudine when 
both medicinal products were taken in combination with didanosine and efavirenz through 48 weeks 
of treatment.  Phenotypic analysis showed no significant changes in emtricitabine susceptibility unless 
the M184V/I mutation had developed. 
In virologically stable treatment-experienced adults, emtricitabine, in combination with an NRTI 
(either stavudine or zidovudine) and a PI or an NNRTI was shown to be non-inferior to lamivudine 
with respect to the proportion of responders (< 400 copies/mL) through 48 weeks (77% emtricitabine, 
82% lamivudine).  Additionally, in a second study, treatment-experienced adults on a stable PI-based 
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen were randomised to a once daily regimen 
containing emtricitabine or to continue with their PI-HAART regimen.  At 48 weeks of treatment the 
emtricitabine-containing regimen demonstrated an equivalent proportion of patients with HIV RNA 
< 400 copies/mL (94% emtricitabine versus 92%) and a greater proportion of patients with HIV RNA 
< 50 copies/mL (95% emtricitabine versus 87%) compared with the patients continuing with their 
PI-HAART regimen. 
Paediatric population 
In infants and children older than 4 months, the majority of patients achieved or maintained complete 
suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA through 48 weeks (89% achieved ≤ 400 copies/mL and 77% 
achieved ≤ 50 copies/mL). 
There is no clinical experience of the use of emtricitabine in infants less than 4 months of age. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Emtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma 
concentrations occurring at 1 to 2 hours post-dose.  In 20 HIV infected subjects receiving 200 mg 
emtricitabine daily as hard capsules, steady-state plasma emtricitabine peak concentrations (Cmax), 
trough concentrations (Cmin) and area under the plasma concentration time curve over a 24-hour dosing 
interval (AUC) were 1.8 ± 0.7 µg/mL, 0.09 ± 0.07 µg/mL and 10.0 ± 3.1 µg·h/mL, respectively.  
Steady-state trough plasma concentrations reached levels approximately 4-fold above the in vitro IC90 
values for anti-HIV activity. 
The absolute bioavailability of emtricitabine from Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules was estimated to be 
93% and the absolute bioavailability from Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution was estimated to be 75%. 
In a pilot study in children and a definitive bioequivalence study in adults, the Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral 
solution was shown to have approximately 80% of the bioavailability of the Emtriva 200 mg hard 
capsules.  The reason for this difference is unknown.  Due to this difference in bioavailability, 240 mg 
emtricitabine administered as the oral solution should provide similar plasma levels to those observed 
after administration of one 200 mg emtricitabine hard capsule.  Therefore, children who weigh at least 
33 kg may take either one 200 mg hard capsule daily or the oral solution up to a maximum dose of 
240 mg (24 mL), once daily. 
Administration of Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules with a high-fat meal or administration of Emtriva 
10 mg/mL oral solution with a low-fat or high-fat meal did not affect systemic exposure (AUC0-∞) of 
emtricitabine; therefore Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules and Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution may be 
administered with or without food. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
In vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of 
concentration over the range of 0.02-200 µg/mL.  The mean plasma to blood concentration ratio was 
approximately 1.0 and the mean semen to plasma concentration ratio was approximately 4.0. 
The apparent volume of distribution after intravenous administration of emtricitabine was 
1.4 ± 0.3 L/kg, indicating that emtricitabine is widely distributed throughout the body to both 
intracellular and extracellular fluid spaces. 
Biotransformation 
There is limited metabolism of emtricitabine.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes 
oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3’-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and 
conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2’-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). 
Emtricitabine did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by the following human CYP450 
isoenzymes: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. 
Also, emtricitabine did not inhibit uridine-5’-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the enzyme responsible 
for glucuronidation. 
Elimination 
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in 
urine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine 
dose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged 
307 mL/min (4.03 mL/min/kg).  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of 
emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine are proportional to dose over the dose range of 25-200 mg 
following single or repeated administration. 
Intracellular pharmacokinetics: In a clinical study, the intracellular half-life of 
emtricitabine-triphosphate in PBMCs was 39 hours.  Intracellular triphosphate levels increased with 
dose, but reached a plateau at doses of 200 mg or greater. 
Adults with renal insufficiency 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined following administration of a single dose of 200 mg 
emtricitabine hard capsules to 30 non-HIV infected subjects with varying degrees of renal 
insufficiency.  Subjects were grouped according to baseline creatinine clearance (> 80 mL/min as 
normal function; 50-80 mL/min as mild impairment; 30-49 mL/min as moderate impairment; 
< 30 mL/min as severe impairment; < 15 mL/min as functionally anephric requiring haemodialysis). 
The systemic emtricitabine exposure (mean ± standard deviation) increased from 11.8 ± 2.9 µg·h/mL 
in subjects with normal renal function to 19.9 ± 1.1, 25.0 ± 5.7 and 34.0 ± 2.1 µg·h/mL, in patients 
with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. 
In patients with ESRD on haemodialysis, approximately 30% of the emtricitabine dose was recovered 
in dialysate over a 3-hour dialysis period which had been started within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine 
dosing (blood flow rate of 400 mL/min and dialysate flow rate of approximately 600 mL/min). 
Hepatic insufficiency 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in non-HBV infected subjects with 
varying degrees of hepatic insufficiency.  In general, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected 
subjects were similar to those in healthy subjects and in HIV infected subjects. 
Age 
Pharmacokinetic data are not available in the elderly (over 65 years of age). 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gender 
Although the mean Cmax and Cmin were approximately 20% higher and mean AUC was 16% higher in 
females compared to males, this difference was not considered clinically significant. 
Ethnicity 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic difference due to ethnicity has been identified. 
Paediatric population 
In general, the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine in infants, children and adolescents (aged 4 months 
up to 18 years) are similar to those seen in adults. 
The mean AUC in 77 infants, children and adolescents receiving 6 mg/kg emtricitabine once daily as 
oral solution or 200 mg emtricitabine as hard capsules once daily was similar to the mean AUC of 
10.0 µg·h/mL in 20 adults receiving 200 mg hard capsules once daily. 
In an open-label, non-comparative study, pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 20 neonates of 
HIV infected mothers who received two 4-day courses of emtricitabine oral solution between the first 
week of life and 3 months of age at a dose level of 3 mg/kg once daily.  This dose is half of that 
approved for infants aged 4 months and over (6 mg/kg).  The apparent total body clearance at 
steady-state (CL/F) increased with age over the 3-month period with a corresponding decrease in 
AUC.  Plasma emtricitabine exposure (AUC) in infants up to 3 months of age who received 3 mg/kg 
emtricitabine once daily was similar to that observed using 6 mg/kg daily doses in HIV infected adults 
and children aged 4 months and over. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies 
of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction and development.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Emtriva is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of 
human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected adults and children aged 4 months and over. 
This indication is based on studies in treatment-naïve patients and treatment-experienced patients with 
stable virological control.  There is no experience of the use of Emtriva in patients who are failing 
their current regimen or who have failed multiple regimens (see section 5.1). 
When deciding on a new regimen for patients who have failed an antiretroviral regimen, careful 
consideration should be given to the patterns of mutations associated with different medicinal products 
and the treatment history of the individual patient.  Where available, resistance testing may be 
appropriate. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Posology 
Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution may be taken with or without food.  A measuring cup is provided (see 
section 6.5). 
Adults: The recommended dose of Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution is 240 mg (24 mL) once daily. 
If a patient misses a dose of Emtriva within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should 
take Emtriva with or without food as soon as possible and resume their normal dosing schedule.  If a 
patient misses a dose of Emtriva by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for their next dose, the 
patient should not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule.

If the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Emtriva, another dose should be taken.  If the patient 
vomits more than 1 hour after taking Emtriva they do not need to take another dose. 
Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules are available for adults, adolescents and children who weigh at least 
33 kg and can swallow hard capsules.  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for 
Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules.  Due to a difference in the bioavailability of emtricitabine between the 
hard capsule and oral solution presentations, 240 mg emtricitabine administered as the oral solution 
(24 mL) should provide similar plasma levels to those observed after administration of one 200 mg 
emtricitabine hard capsule (see section 5.2). 
Special populations 
Elderly: There are no safety and efficacy data available in patients over the age of 65 years.  However, 
no adjustment in the recommended daily dose for adults should be required unless there is evidence of 
renal insufficiency. 
Renal insufficiency: Emtricitabine is eliminated by renal excretion and exposure to emtricitabine was 
significantly increased in patients with renal insufficiency (see section 5.2).  Dose or dose interval 
adjustment is required in all patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (see section 4.4). 
Table 1 below provides daily doses of Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution according to the degree of 
renal insufficiency.  The safety and efficacy of these doses have not been clinically evaluated.  
Therefore, clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these 
patients (see section 4.4). 
Patients with renal insufficiency can also be managed by administration of Emtriva 200 mg hard 
capsules at modified dose intervals.  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for 
Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) managed with other forms of dialysis such as 
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis have not been studied and no dose recommendations can be made. 
Hepatic insufficiency: No data are available on which to make a dose recommendation for patients 
with hepatic insufficiency.  However, based on the minimal metabolism of emtricitabine and the renal 
route of elimination it is unlikely that a dose adjustment would be required in patients with hepatic 
insufficiency (see section 5.2). 
If Emtriva is discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV), these patients 
should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population: The recommended dose of Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution is 6 mg/kg up to a 
maximum of 240 mg (24 mL) once daily. 
Children aged 4 months and over, who weigh at least 33 kg may either take one 200 mg hard capsule 
daily or may take emtricitabine as the oral solution up to a maximum of 240 mg once daily. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no data regarding the efficacy and only very limited data regarding the safety of 
emtricitabine in infants below 4 months of age.  Therefore Emtriva is not recommended for use in 
those aged less than 4 months (for pharmacokinetic data in this age group, see section 5.2). 
No data are available on which to make a dose recommendation in paediatric patients with renal 
insufficiency. 
Method of administration 
Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution should be taken once daily, orally with or without food.  A measuring 
cup is provided (see section 6.5). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Emtricitabine is not recommended as monotherapy for the treatment of HIV infection.  It must be used 
in combination with other antiretrovirals.  Please also refer to the Summaries of Product 
Characteristics of the other antiretroviral medicinal products used in the combination regimen. 
Co-administration of other medicinal products 
Emtriva should not be taken with any other medicinal products containing emtricitabine or medicinal 
products containing lamivudine. 
Opportunistic infections 
Patients receiving emtricitabine or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop 
opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under 
close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated 
diseases. 
Renal function 
Emtricitabine is principally eliminated by the kidney via glomerular filtration and active tubular 
secretion.  Emtricitabine exposure may be markedly increased in patients with severe renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) receiving daily doses of 200 mg emtricitabine as 
hard capsules or 240 mg as the oral solution.  Consequently, either a dose interval adjustment (using 
Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules) or a reduction in the daily dose of emtricitabine (using Emtriva 
10 mg/mL oral solution) is required in all patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min.  The safety 
and efficacy of the reduced doses provided in section 4.2 are based on single dose pharmacokinetic 
data and modelling and have not been clinically evaluated.  Therefore, clinical response to treatment 
and renal function should be closely monitored in patients treated with a reduced dose of emtricitabine 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Caution should be exercised when emtricitabine is co-administered with medicinal products that are 
eliminated by active tubular secretion as such co-administration may lead to an increase in serum 
concentrations of either emtricitabine or a co-administered medicinal product, due to competition for 
this elimination pathway (see section 4.5). 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Liver function 
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased 
frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and 
should be monitored according to standard practice.  Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C infection 
treated with CART are at increased risk of experiencing severe, and potentially fatal, hepatic adverse 
events.  In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please also refer to the relevant 
Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. 
If there is evidence of exacerbations of liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of 
treatment must be considered. 
Patients co-infected with HBV 
Emtricitabine is active in vitro against HBV.  However, limited data are available on the efficacy and 
safety of emtricitabine (as a 200 mg hard capsule once daily) in patients who are co-infected with HIV 
and HBV.  The use of emtricitabine in patients with chronic HBV induces the same mutation pattern 
in the YMDD motif observed with lamivudine therapy.  The YMDD mutation confers resistance to 
both emtricitabine and lamivudine. 
Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory 
follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with emtricitabine for evidence of 
exacerbations of hepatitis.  Such exacerbations have been seen following discontinuation of 
emtricitabine treatment in HBV infected patients without concomitant HIV infection and have been 
detected primarily by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations in addition to re-emergence of 
HBV DNA.  In some of these patients, HBV reactivation was associated with more severe liver 
disease, including decompensation and liver failure.  There is insufficient evidence to determine 
whether re-initiation of emtricitabine alters the course of post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis.  In 
patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since 
post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero 
Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most 
pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these 
have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders 
(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological 
disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such 
neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be 
considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical 
findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current 
national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV. 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause 
serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed 
within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include 
cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis 
jirovecii pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when 
necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint 
stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
Emtriva oral solution contains sunset yellow (E110) which may cause allergic reactions, methyl 
parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl parahydroxybenzoate (E216) which may cause allergic 
reactions (possibly delayed).  This medicinal product contains 38 mg of sodium per 24 mL, equivalent 
to 1.8% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Elderly 
Emtriva has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more likely to have 
decreased renal function; therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients with 
Emtriva. 
Paediatric population 
In addition to the adverse reactions experienced by adults, anaemia and skin discolouration occurred 
more frequently in clinical trials involving HIV infected paediatric patients (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
In vitro, emtricitabine did not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following human CYP450 
isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4.  Emtricitabine did not inhibit the enzyme 
responsible for glucuronidation.  Based on the results of these in vitro experiments and the known 
elimination pathways of emtricitabine, the potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving 
emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low. 
There are no clinically significant interactions when emtricitabine is co-administered with indinavir, 
zidovudine, stavudine, famciclovir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.  With the 
exception of famciclovir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the effect of co-administration of 
emtricitabine with medicinal products that are excreted by the renal route, or other medicinal products 
known to affect renal function, has not been evaluated.  Co-administration of emtricitabine with 
medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may lead to an increase in serum 
concentrations of either emtricitabine or a co-administered medicinal product due to competition for 
this elimination pathway. 
There is no clinical experience as yet on the co-administration of cytidine analogues.  Consequently, 
the use of emtricitabine in combination with lamivudine for the treatment of HIV infection cannot be 
recommended at this time. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300 and1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate 
no malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine.  Animal studies do not 
indicate reproductive toxicity.  The use of emtricitabine may be considered during pregnancy, if 
necessary. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Emtricitabine has been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is insufficient information on the 
effects of emtricitabine in newborns/infants.  Therefore Emtriva should not be used during breast-
feeding. 
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants.  
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of emtricitabine are available.  Animal studies do not indicate harmful 
effects of emtricitabine on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, 
patients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with emtricitabine. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials of HIV infected adults, the most frequently occurring adverse reactions to 
emtricitabine were diarrhoea (14.0%), headache (10.2%), elevated creatine kinase (10.2%) and nausea 
(10.0%).  In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anaemia (9.5%) and skin 
discolouration (31.8%) occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving HIV infected paediatric 
patients. 
Discontinuation of Emtriva therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with 
severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
Assessment of adverse reactions from clinical study data is based on experience in three studies in 
adults (n = 1,479) and three paediatric studies (n = 169).  In the adult studies, 1,039 treatment-naïve 
and 440 treatment-experienced patients received emtricitabine (n = 814) or comparator medicinal 
product (n = 665) for 48 weeks in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. 
The adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment in adults from clinical 
trial and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 2 below by body system organ class and 
frequency.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) or 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100).

3 This adverse reaction, which was identified through post-marketing surveillance, was not observed in randomised 
controlled clinical trials in adults or paediatric HIV clinical trials of emtricitabine.  The frequency category of uncommon 
was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to emtricitabine in these clinical 
studies (n = 1,563). 
pain, asthenia 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Skin discolouration (increased pigmentation): Skin discolouration, manifested by hyperpigmentation 
mainly on the palms and/or soles, was generally mild, asymptomatic and of little clinical significance.  
The mechanism is unknown. 
Metabolic parameters: Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during 
antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time 
of initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections 
may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been 
reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many 
months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis: Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally 
acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of 
this is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Assessment of adverse reactions in paediatric patients from clinical study data is based on experience 
in three paediatric studies (n = 169) where treatment-naïve (n = 123) and treatment-experienced 
(n = 46) paediatric HIV infected patients aged 4 months to 18 years were treated with emtricitabine in 
combination with other antiretroviral agents. 
In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults (see section 4.8, Tabulated summary of adverse 
reactions), the following adverse reactions were observed more frequently in paediatric patients: 
anaemia was common (9.5%) and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common 
(31.8%) in paediatric patients. 
Other special population(s) 
Elderly: Emtriva has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more likely 
to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients 
with Emtriva (see section 4.2). 
Patients with renal impairment: Emtricitabine is eliminated by renal excretion and exposure to 
emtricitabine was significantly increased in patients with renal insufficiency.  Dose or dose interval 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adjustment is required in all patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.2). 
HIV/HBV co-infected patients: The adverse reaction profile in patients co-infected with HBV is 
similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV without co-infection with HBV.  However, as 
would be expected in this patient population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently 
than in the general HIV infected population. 
Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: In HIV infected patients co-infected 
with HBV, exacerbations of hepatitis may occur after discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Administration of up to 1,200 mg emtricitabine has been associated with the adverse reactions listed 
above (see section 4.8). 
If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored for signs of toxicity and standard supportive 
treatment applied as necessary. 
Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose can be removed by haemodialysis.  It is not known whether 
emtricitabine can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, ATC code: 
J05AF09 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of cytidine with activity that is specific to HIV-1, 
HIV-2and HBV. 
Emtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5’-triphosphate, which 
competitively inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain termination.  Emtricitabine 
is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerase α, β and ε and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. 
Emtricitabine did not exhibit cytotoxicity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), established 
lymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage cell lines or bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro.  There was 
no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro or in vivo. 
Antiviral activity in vitro: The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for emtricitabine against 
laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was in the range of 0.0013 to 0.5 µmol/l.  In combination 
studies of emtricitabine with protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside, nucleotide and non-nucleoside 
analogue inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase, additive to synergistic effects were observed.  Most 
of these combinations have not been studied in humans. 
When tested for activity against laboratory strains of HBV, the IC50value for emtricitabine was in the 
range of 0.01 to 0.04 µmol/l. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Resistance: HIV-1 resistance to emtricitabine develops as the result of changes at codon 184 causing 
the methionine to be changed to a valine (an isoleucine intermediate has also been observed) of the 
HIV reverse transcriptase.  This HIV-1 mutation was observed in vitro and in HIV-1 infected patients. 
Emtricitabine-resistant viruses were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained sensitivity to other 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (zidovudine, stavudine, tenofovir, abacavir and 
didanosine), all non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and all PIs.  Viruses 
resistant to zidovudine, didanosine and NNRTIs retained their sensitivity to emtricitabine 
(IC50= 0.002 µmol/l to 0.08 µmol/l). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Emtricitabine in combination with other antiretroviral agents, including nucleoside analogues, 
non-nucleoside analogues and PIs, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of HIV infection in 
treatment-naïve patients and treatment-experienced patients with stable virological control.  There is 
no experience of the use of emtricitabine in patients who are failing their current regimen or who have 
failed multiple regimens. 
In antiretroviral treatment-naïve adults, emtricitabine was significantly superior to stavudine when 
both medicinal products were taken in combination with didanosine and efavirenz through 48 weeks 
of treatment.  Phenotypic analysis showed no significant changes in emtricitabine susceptibility unless 
the M184V/I mutation had developed. 
In virologically stable treatment-experienced adults, emtricitabine, in combination with an NRTI 
(either stavudine or zidovudine) and a protease inhibitor (PI) or an NNRTI was shown to be 
non-inferior to lamivudine with respect to the proportion of responders (< 400 copies/mL) through 
48 weeks (77% emtricitabine, 82% lamivudine).  Additionally, in a second study, 
treatment-experienced adults on a stable PI based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 
regimen were randomised to a once daily regimen containing emtricitabine or to continue with their 
PI-HAART regimen.  At 48 weeks of treatment the emtricitabine-containing regimen demonstrated an 
equivalent proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL (94% emtricitabine versus 92%) 
and a greater proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL (95% emtricitabine versus 87%) 
compared with the patients continuing with their PI-HAART regimen. 
Paediatric population 
In infants and children older than 4 months, the majority of patients achieved or maintained complete 
suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA through 48 weeks (89% achieved ≤ 400 copies/mL and 77% 
achieved ≤ 50 copies/mL). 
There is no clinical experience of the use of emtricitabine in infants less than 4 months of age. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Emtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma 
concentrations occurring at 1 to 2 hours post-dose.  In 20 HIV infected subjects receiving 200 mg 
emtricitabine daily as hard capsules, steady-state plasma emtricitabine peak concentrations (Cmax), 
trough concentrations (Cmin) and area under the plasma concentration time curve over a 24-hour dosing 
interval (AUC) were 1.8 ± 0.7 µg/mL, 0.09 ± 0.07 µg/mL and 10.0 ± 3.1 µg·h/mL, respectively.  
Steady-state trough plasma concentrations reached levels approximately 4-fold above the in vitro IC90 
values for anti-HIV activity. 
The absolute bioavailability of emtricitabine from Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules was estimated to be 
93% and the absolute bioavailability from Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution was estimated to be 75%. 
In a pilot study in children and a definitive bioequivalence study in adults, the Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral 
solution was shown to have approximately 80% of the bioavailability of the Emtriva 200 mg hard 
capsules.  The reason for this difference is unknown.  Due to this difference in bioavailability, 240 mg 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
emtricitabine administered as the oral solution should provide similar plasma levels to those observed 
after administration of one 200 mg emtricitabine hard capsule.  Therefore, children who weigh at least 
33 kg may take either one 200 mg hard capsule daily or the oral solution up to a maximum dose of 
240 mg (24 mL), once daily. 
Administration of Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules with a high-fat meal or administration of Emtriva 
10 mg/mL oral solution with a low-fat or high-fat meal did not affect systemic exposure (AUC0-∞) of 
emtricitabine; therefore Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules and Emtriva 10 mg/mL oral solution may be 
administered with or without food. 
Distribution 
In vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of 
concentration over the range of 0.02-200 µg/mL.  The mean plasma to blood concentration ratio was 
approximately 1.0 and the mean semen to plasma concentration ratio was approximately 4.0. 
The apparent volume of distribution after intravenous administration of emtricitabine was 
1.4 ± 0.3 L/kg, indicating that emtricitabine is widely distributed throughout the body to both 
intracellular and extracellular fluid spaces. 
Biotransformation 
There is limited metabolism of emtricitabine.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes 
oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and 
conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). 
Emtricitabine did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by the following human CYP450 
isoenzymes: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. 
Also, emtricitabine did not inhibit uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the enzyme responsible 
for glucuronidation. 
Elimination 
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in 
urine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine 
dose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged 
307 mL/min (4.03 mL/min/kg).  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of 
emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine are proportional to dose over the dose range of 25-200 mg 
following single or repeated administration. 
Intracellular pharmacokinetics: In a clinical study, the intracellular half-life of 
emtricitabine-triphosphate in PBMCs was 39 hours.  Intracellular triphosphate levels increased with 
dose, but reached a plateau at doses of 200 mg or greater. 
Adults with renal insufficiency 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined following administration of a single dose of 200 mg 
emtricitabine hard capsules to 30 non-HIV infected subjects with varying degrees of renal 
insufficiency.  Subjects were grouped according to baseline creatinine clearance (> 80 mL/min as 
normal function; 50-80 mL/min as mild impairment; 30-49 mL/min as moderate impairment; 
< 30 mL/min as severe impairment; < 15 mL/min as functionally anephric requiring haemodialysis). 
The systemic emtricitabine exposure (mean ± standard deviation) increased from 11.8 ± 2.9 µg·h/mL 
in subjects with normal renal function to 19.9 ± 1.1, 25.0 ± 5.7 and 34.0 ± 2.1 µg·h/mL, in patients 
with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with ESRD on haemodialysis, approximately 30% of the emtricitabine dose was recovered 
in dialysate over a 3 hour dialysis period which had been started within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine 
dosing (blood flow rate of 400 mL/min and dialysate flow rate of approximately 600 mL/min). 
Hepatic insufficiency 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in non-HBV infected subjects with 
varying degrees of hepatic insufficiency.  In general, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected 
subjects were similar to those in healthy subjects and in HIV infected subjects. 
Age 
Pharmacokinetic data are not available in the elderly (over 65 years of age). 
Gender 
Although the mean Cmax and Cmin were approximately 20% higher and mean AUC was 16% higher in 
females compared to males, this difference was not considered clinically significant. 
Ethnicity 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic difference due to ethnicity has been identified. 
Paediatric population 
In general, the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine in infants, children and adolescents (aged 4 months 
up to 18 years) are similar to those seen in adults. 
The mean AUC in 77 infants, children and adolescents receiving 6 mg/kg emtricitabine once daily as 
oral solution or 200 mg emtricitabine as hard capsules once daily was similar to the mean AUC of 
10.0 µg·h/mL in 20 adults receiving 200 mg hard capsules once daily. 
In an open-label, non-comparative study, pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 20 neonates of 
HIV infected mothers who received two 4-day courses of emtricitabine oral solution between the first 
week of life and 3 months of age at a dose level of 3 mg/kg once daily.  This dose is half of that 
approved for infants aged 4 months and over (6 mg/kg).  The apparent total body clearance at steady-
state (CL/F) increased with age over the 3-month period with a corresponding decrease in AUC.  
Plasma emtricitabine exposure (AUC) in infants up to 3 months of age who received 3 mg/kg 
emtricitabine once daily was similar to that observed using 6 mg/kg daily doses in HIV infected adults 
and children aged 4 months and over. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies 
of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction and development.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Emtriva is and what it is used for 
Emtriva is a treatment for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults, children and 
infants aged 4 months and over.  Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules are only suitable for patients who 
weigh at least 33 kg.  Emtriva oral solution is available for people who have difficulty in swallowing 
Emtriva hard capsules. 
Emtriva contains the active substance emtricitabine.  This active substance is an antiretroviral 
medicine which is used to treat HIV infection.  Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NRTI) which works by interfering with the normal working of an enzyme (reverse 
transcriptase) that is essential for the HIV virus to reproduce itself.  Emtriva may lower the amount of 
HIV in the blood (viral load).  It may also help to increase the number of T cells called CD4 cells.  
Emtriva should always be combined with other medicines to treat HIV infection. 
This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Emtriva you may still develop 
infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Emtriva 
Do not take Emtriva 
• 
If you are allergic to emtricitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
 If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. 
Warnings and precautions 
• 
Tell your doctor if you have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown problems with your 
kidneys.  Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to assess kidney function 
and may advise you to take the capsules less often or prescribe Emtriva oral solution.  Your 
doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor your kidneys.

• 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor if you are over 65.  Emtriva has not been studied in patients over 65 years 
of age.  If you are older than this and are prescribed Emtriva, your doctor will monitor you 
carefully. 
Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with 
liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a 
higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, 
your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you.  If you have a history of 
liver disease or chronic hepatitis B infection your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to 
carefully monitor liver function. 
Look out for infections.  If you have advanced HIV disease (AIDS) and another infection, you 
may develop inflammation or worsening of the symptoms of infection when you start treatment 
with Emtriva.  These may be signs that your body’s improved immune system is fighting 
infection.  If you notice signs of inflammation or infection soon after you start taking Emtriva, 
tell your doctor at once. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment. 
Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone 
disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many 
risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and 
pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.  If you notice any 
of these symptoms please inform your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give Emtriva to infants under 4 months of age. 
Other medicines and Emtriva 
You should not take Emtriva if you are already taking other medicines that contain emtricitabine or 
lamivudine, which are also used to treat HIV infection, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Do not stop your treatment without contacting your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
If you have taken Emtriva during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and 
other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took 
NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side 
effects. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not breast-feed if you are taking Emtriva.  This is because the active substance in this medicine 
passes into human breast milk.   
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. 
Driving and using machines 
Emtriva may cause dizziness.  If you experience dizziness while taking Emtriva, do not drive and do 
not use any tools or machines.

How to take Emtriva 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is: 
• 
• 
Adults: one 200 mg hard capsule, each day with or without food.  Swallow the hard capsule 
with a glass of water. 
Children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who weigh at least 33 kg and who are able to 
swallow hard capsules: one 200 mg hard capsule, each day with or without food. 
For infants from 4 months, children, and patients who are unable to swallow hard capsules and 
patients with kidney problems, Emtriva is available as a liquid (an oral solution).  If you have 
difficulty in swallowing the capsules, tell your doctor. 
• 
• 
• 
Always take the dose recommended by your doctor.  This is to make sure that your medicine 
is fully effective, and to reduce the risk of developing resistance to the treatment.  Do not 
change the dose unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have problems with your kidneys, your doctor may advise you to take Emtriva less 
frequently. 
Your doctor will prescribe Emtriva with other antiretroviral medicines.  Please refer to the 
package leaflets of the other antiretrovirals for guidance on how to take those medicines. 
If you take more Emtriva than you should 
If you accidentally take too many Emtriva hard capsules, contact your doctor or nearest emergency 
department for advice.  Keep the carton with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. 
If you forget to take Emtriva 
It is important not to miss a dose of Emtriva. 
If you do miss a dose of Emtriva within 12 hours of when it is usually taken, take it as soon as you 
can, and then take your next dose at its regular time. 
If it is almost time (less than 12 hours) for your next dose anyway, forget about the missed dose.  
Wait and take the next dose at the regular time.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
hard capsule. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are sick (vomit) 
If it’s less than an hour since you took Emtriva, take another capsule.  You do not need to take 
another capsule if you were sick more than an hour after taking Emtriva. 
If you stop taking Emtriva 
• 
• 
Don’t stop taking Emtriva without talking to your doctor.  Stopping treatment with Emtriva 
may reduce the effectiveness of the anti-HIV therapy recommended by your doctor.  Speak with 
your doctor before you stop, particularly if you are experiencing any side effects or you have 
another illness.  Contact your doctor again before you restart taking Emtriva capsules. 
If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your 
Emtriva treatment without talking to your doctor first.  Some patients have had blood tests or 
symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping Emtriva.  You may require 
blood tests for several months after stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver 
disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of 
hepatitis. 
Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly 
symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor about any of the following side effects: 
Most frequent side effects 
The following side effects are very common (these can affect at least 10 in every 100 patients):

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Emtriva is and what it is used for 
Emtriva is a treatment for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults, children and 
infants aged 4 months and over.  Emtriva oral solution is particularly suitable for people who have 
difficulty in swallowing Emtriva hard capsules. 
Emtriva contains the active substance emtricitabine.  This active substance is an antiretroviral 
medicine which is used to treat HIV infection.  Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NRTI) which works by interfering with the normal working of an enzyme (reverse 
transcriptase) that is essential for the HIV virus to reproduce itself.  Emtriva may lower the amount of 
HIV in the blood (viral load).  It may also help to increase the number of T cells called CD4 cells.  
Emtriva should always be combined with other medicines to treat HIV infection. 
This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Emtriva you may still develop 
infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Emtriva 
Do not take Emtriva 
• 
If you are allergic to emtricitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
 If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. 
Warnings and precautions 
• 
Tell your doctor if you have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown problems with your 
kidneys.  Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to assess kidney function 
and may advise you to take a reduced dose of the oral solution or prescribe Emtriva hard 
capsules.  Your doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor your kidneys. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor if you are over 65.  Emtriva has not been studied in patients over 65 years 
of age.  If you are older than this and are prescribed Emtriva, your doctor will monitor you 
carefully. 
Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with 
liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a 
higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, 
your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you.  If you have a history of 
liver disease or chronic hepatitis B infection your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to 
carefully monitor liver function. 
Look out for infections.  If you have advanced HIV disease (AIDS) and another infection, you 
may develop inflammation or worsening of the symptoms of infection when you start treatment 
with Emtriva.  These may be signs that your body’s improved immune system is fighting 
infection.  If you notice signs of inflammation or infection soon after you start taking Emtriva, 
tell your doctor at once. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when 
the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines 
for the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after 
the start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as 
muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of 
the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek 
necessary treatment. 
Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone 
disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many 
risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and 
pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.  If you notice any 
of these symptoms please inform your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give Emtriva to infants under 4 months of age. 
Other medicines and Emtriva 
You should not take Emtriva if you are already taking other medicines that contain emtricitabine or 
lamivudine, which are also used to treat HIV infection, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Do not stop your treatment without contacting your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
If you have taken Emtriva during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and 
other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took 
NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side 
effects. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not breast-feed if you are taking Emtriva.  This is because the active substance in this medicine 
passes into human breast milk. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible. 
Driving and using machines 
Emtriva may cause dizziness.  If you experience dizziness while taking Emtriva, do not drive and do 
not use any tools or machines. 
Emtriva oral solution contains: 
Sunset yellow (E110) may cause allergic reactions.  The methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and 
propyl parahydroxybenzoate (E216) may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).  This medicine 
contains 38 mg of sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per 24 mL dose.This is equivalent 
to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium  for an adult. 
This medicine also contains 480 mg propylene glycol per 24 mL (maximum single dose) which is 
equivalent to a maximum of 12 mg/kg/day.

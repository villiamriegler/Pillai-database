1.  RECOMMENDATION 
Based on the review of the data on pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy from study TMC114-TÍDP-
C230, the Rapporteur considers that the Article 46 paediatric study submission is fulfilled. However, 
further data are expected in the context of a variation application, prior any final conclusion is made. 
Indeed, the submission of a type II variation application to extend the indication to treatment-naïve 
HIV-1 infected paediatrics aged 3 to <18 years of age, is planned in the 2nd half of 2012. The data of 
trial TMC114-TÍDP29-C230 will need to be complemented with Population Pharmacokinetic modeling 
results and requires the prior registration of the darunavir (DRV) Oral Suspension to allow for dosing in 
the young age groups. However, one concern related to pharmacokinetics from study TMC114-TÍDP-
C230 remains outstanding and should be dealt with at the time of submission of this variation 
application. Moreover, the concern about safety in children has been sufficiently addressed for now, 
but requires further evaluation at the time of submission of this variation application (see section 11). 
The Rapporteur’s assessment of the Applicant’s response to the request for supplementary 
information and conclusions are given in sections 10 and 11 (page 14 and following) 
2.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
2.1 Problem statement 
Similar to the development of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/rtv) in adults, the paediatric clinical 
development program focused first on treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children, and progressed 
from older to younger children: a weight based DRV/rtv twice daily (b.i.d.) regimen has been 
investigated in trial TMC114-C212 in treatment-experienced paediatric patients from 6 to < 18 years of 
age, followed by trial TMC114-TiDP29-C228 in treatment-experienced paediatric patients from 3 to < 6 
years of age. In addition, after at least 32 weeks of treatment with the twice daily regimen, the 
pharmacokinetics of a DRV/rtv once daily (q.d.) regimen was evaluated in a subset of TMC114-C228 
patients after a 2 week once daily treatment period. Finally, the use of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily 
in treatment-naïve adolescents between 12 to < 18 years of age has been investigated in TMC114-
TiDP29-C230 (further referred to as C230). 
Trial C230 [A Phase II, open-label trial, to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and antiviral 
activity of DRV/rtv once daily in treatment-naïve HIV 1 infected adolescents aged between 12 and < 
18 years.] in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, is subject of this Article 46 
submission. 
The applicant, on behalf of Janssen-Cilag International NV, states that, in accordance with Article 16(2) 
of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for 
PREZISTA and therefore do not require to take further regulatory action on the marketing 
authorisation for PREZISTA. 
A type II variation application to extend the indication to treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected paediatrics 
aged 3 - <18 years of age, based on study C230 and complemented with Population Pharmacokinetic 
modeling results, is planned for submission to EMA in the 2nd half of 2012, as it requires the prior 
registration of the darunavir Oral Suspension to allow for dosing in the young age groups. The 
evaluation of the Oral Suspension is currently under review (EMEA/H/C/707/X041G).

Therefore, any issues identified during the current assessment should be taken into account within the 
intended type II variation, but no recommendations will be made on the inclusion of paediatric data 
into the SmPC. This will await the assessment of the full data package within the Type II application.

5.  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
Pharmacokinetics 
Based on the results of trial C211 in ART-naïve adults and trial C212 in treatment-experienced HIV-1 
infected children and adolescents, it was expected that the dose of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d., 
recommended for treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, would also be appropriate for treatment-
naïve HIV-1 infected subjects aged between 12 and < 18 years, and weighing ≥ 40 kg. 
The use of DRV/rtv in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents between 12 to < 18 years of age 
has been evaluated in the 48-week, Phase II, open-label trial TMC114-C230, involving 12 subjects 
(male and female). This study was initiated in August 2009 and the last visit of the last patient in the 
study took place on March 31, 2011. The 12 adolescents were included in 6 countries: France, UK, 
Italy, Spain (each one subject), Ukraine (6 subjects), USA (2 subjects). 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of DRV/rtv administered at 800/100 mg q.d. in combination with an investigator selected 
background regimen, consisting of either zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) or abacavir (ABC)/3TC, 
over a 24-week treatment period in ARV treatment-naïve HIV 1 infected adolescents aged between 12 
and < 18 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg. 
The secondary objectives were: 
- 
to evaluate long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. (in 
combination with an investigator-selected background regimen) over a 48-week treatment 
period in this population; 
Prezista 
P46 066 
Page 4/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
- 
to evaluate immunology, resistance characteristics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacokinetic/ 
pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships over 48 weeks of treatment with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg 
q.d. (in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen) in this population. 
In the TMC114-C230 study, the same once-daily dose schedule of DRV/rtv, as recommended for 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, was investigated, i.e., DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d., in 
combination with ≥ 2 NRTIs (AZT/3TC or ABC/3TC). The combination of a rtv-boosted PI and 2 NRTIs 
is a recommended treatment for ARV-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects aged between 12 and < 18 years 
and adults. 
12 patients, 4 males and 8 females, aged 12.6 – 17.3 years, were included. Subjects received 2 x 400-
mg DRV tablets (formulation F030) combined with 1 x 100-mg rtv capsule once daily, in combination 
with an investigator-selected background regimen (AZT/3TC or ABC/3TC). 
During the first 2 weeks of the study, DRV/rtv had to be taken in the morning to facilitate the rich 
pharmacokinetic 24-hour sampling for all subjects at Week 2 (Day 14 and 24-hour sample at Day 15). 
After completion of the 24-hour intensive pharmacokinetic sample collection at Week 2, subjects had 
the choice whether to take the DRV/rtv dose in the morning or in the evening. In case a subject 
preferred to switch to dosing in the evening, they had to do so minimally 2 weeks before the next 
sparse blood sampling day. At the time of switching to dosing in the evening, drug administration took 
place within 30 to 36 hours after the last morning dose of DRV/rtv. 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducers were not allowed from 14 days prior to baseline until the end of 
the treatment period and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index were not allowed from 
baseline until the end of the treatment period. 
At Week 2, pharmacokinetic blood sampling was performed at 6 time points over 24 hours for 
evaluation of the pharmacokinetics. At Week 4, 24, and 48, 2 plasma samples were drawn for 
assessment of DRV population pharmacokinetics. Two samples were drawn at least 1 hour apart from 
each other. 
Plasma concentrations of DRV and rtv were determined using a validated liquid chromatographic – 
mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. 
The pharmacokinetics obtained for darunavir and ritonavir obtained at week 2 are shown in tables PK 1 
and 2 and figure PK 1 and 2. One subject (001) had higher plasma concentrations at 24h after 
administration compared to 12h after administration. This sample was not taken into account as it was 
expected that the sample was taken after the next intake. In addition, for subject 008 the 24h sample 
was not taken. Therefore AUC and Cl/F was calculated for 10 subjects.

The existing paediatric population pharmacokinetic model describing the pharmacokinetics of DRV (in 
combination with low-dose rtv) in adults and children aged between 3 and < 18 years was updated 
including the data after once-daily administration in the study C230, as well as the pharmacokinetic 
sub-study of C228 in 3-to-6-year-old children. 
Empirical Bayesian estimates for AUC24h, average steady-state plasma concentration (Css,ave), C0h 
and CL/F were obtained for each subject at each visit, and the median estimate determined within 
each subject. 
The summary of the population pharmacokinetic analysis is shown in table PK 3.

Table PK 3. Summary of the population pharmacokinetic analysis at week 2, 4, 24 and 48. 
Based upon the population pharmacokinetics, one subject (no.0011) had a darunavir C0h plasma 
concentration at week 2 of 530 ng/ml, at week 4 of 478 ng/ml, at week 24 of 751 ng/ml and at week 
48 555 ng/ml.  Subject 007 had C0h values ranging from 771 (week 48) – 1122 ng/ml (week 2 and 4). 
All other subjects had darunavir C0h values above 1000 ng/ml. 
The DRV AUC24h was compared to the AUC24h in adults (target exposure was between 80% to 130% 
of the geometric mean adult exposure of 89.7 μg.h/ml achieved with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d.) as 
determined in study C211 (see table PK 4 for the descriptive statistics at week 48 and figure PK 3).

aged between 12 and < 18 years. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The data indicate that the applied dose of 800/100 mg DRV/RTV in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected 
adolescents resulted in an exposure at week 48 in the target range of adult patients. The results at 
week 2, 4 and 24 were comparable to those obtained at week 48.  
An adult target range of 89.7 μg.h/ml was applied. The MAH should explain this target, as in study 
C211 (800/100 mg in adults) the population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a value of 87.9 μg.h/ml 
(see table below).  
Results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis for AUCtau in study C211: 
One subject (no. 0011) showed consistent low darunavir plasma concentrations, with C0h values below 
or around the EC50 value of 550 ng/ml. 
The bioanalytical report and the population pharmacokinetic analysis report could not be retrieved from 
the submitted dossier. These should be submitted. 
A type II variation application to extend the indication, based on TMC114-TÍDP-C230, is planned for 
submission to EMA in the 2nd half of 2012. From a PK point of view the data submitted do not 
influence the benefit-risk balance for PREZISTA. However, before submission of the type II variation 
application, the concerns identified should be addressed.

6.  CLINICAL EFFICACY  
The primary efficacy parameter was virologic response defined as percent of subjects with confirmed 
plasma viral load < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at Week 24 (TLOVR algorithm).  
Major secondary efficacy parameters were the proportion of subjects with confirmed plasma viral load 
< 50 copies/mL at other time points, and the proportion of subjects with confirmed plasma viral load < 
400 copies/mL, change in log10 plasma viral load, time to virologic response, time to loss of virologic 
response, and change in CD4+ cell count over 48 weeks. 
Sample size 
The  sample size of 12 was chosen because of PK calculations using adult data. Assuming a true 
response rate of 75% at Week 24 (primary parameter: plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL, ITT-TLOVR), 
this sample size of 12 subjects would result in a 2-sided 95% confidence interval for virologic response 
of [49%; 100%]. 
Baseline characteristics 
From the 12 subjects 8 were females. The mean age of the group was 14.6 years; 7 were white and 5 
black or Afro-American. All were treatment-naïve. Mean duration of HIV infection was 3.8 years, 
median (range) 1.7 (0.1; 12.9). Interestingly, 5 from these 12 had vertically transmitted HIV, that 
only required treatment after a prolonged period at this age > 12 years. Still, most were not severely 
ill, because only 1 was categorized as WHO Stage 3. At baseline median CD4+ cell count was 282 x 
106/L (range 204; 515). One patient has concurrent chronic Hepatitis B infection, and was allowed to 
enter according to the inclusion criteria that spelled that chronic Hepatitis B infection that did not 
require treatment during the study, could be included. 
None of the subjects had primary protease inhibitor (PI)-mutations, and 1 subject had 1 DRV 
Resistance Asscociated Mutation (RAM) (V11I), but this subject had a confirmed virologic response 
during the study. The median number of PI RAMs was 4 (range 1 - 6). None of the subjects harbored 
NRTI RAMs. Also phenotypically by use of Antivirogram: all subjects were susceptible to all 
commercially available PIs and NRTIs. 
Treatment   
Concomitant ARVs were either AZT/3TC 6 (50.0%) or ABC/3TC 6 (50.0%). ABC could not be 
administered in those subjects where HLA-B*5701 was tested positive to prevent hypersensitivity 
reactions to ABC. The mean duration of DRV/rtv intake during the study was 49.6 weeks. The total 
patient-years of DRV/rtv exposure was 11.4 years. No discontinuations occurred.

Efficacy 
Primary efficacy parameter: the results of the efficacy analysis for this trial demonstrated that virologic 
response defined as the percentage of subjects with confirmed plasma  
Viral load < 50 copies/mL (ITT - TLOVR) increased progressively over time up to 24 weeks: 
•  Week 24: 11 out of 12 subjects (91.7%);  
•  Week 48: 10 out of 12 subjects (83.3%) had a confirmed virologic response.  
The results were confirmed by other sensitivity analyses, such as the FDA snapshot analysis.  
Confirmed plasma viral load < 400 copies/mL was present  
•  At Week 24 in 12 subjects (100%),  
•  At week 48 in 11 subjects (91.7%). 
Prezista 
P46 066 
Page 12/26 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The mean plasma viral load decreased during the study. At Week 24, the mean change (SE) in log10 
viral load from baseline was -3.03 (0.172) log10 copies/mL, at Week 48 this change was -2.98 (0.182) 
log10 copies/mL from baseline.  
The median time to virologic response defined as < 50 copies/mL (TLOVR) was 16 weeks; to < 400 
copies/mL (TLOVR) was 4 weeks; and to  ≥ 1 log10 decrease in plasma viral load versus baseline was 
2 weeks. 
The CD4+ cell count increased during the study:  
• 
• 
at Week 24, the mean (SE) change in CD4+ cell count from baseline was 175 (19.5) x 106/L,  
at Week 48 this was 221 (22.4) x 106/L.  
Lack of suppression and resistance 
The 2 subjects that did not have viral load < 50 copies/ml at week 48 were 1 never-suppressed 
subject (0008) and 1 rebounder (0011). The never-suppressed subject was non-adherent based on pill 
counts and questionnaire. Although this subject  had a treatment-emergent primary PI mutation 
(M46I), he remained susceptible to all commercially available PIs (including DRV) and NRTIs, including 
the ARVs in the subject’s background regimen (i.e., ABC and 3TC). 
The rebounder’s viral load returned to undetectable (< 50 copies/mL) at Week 48, after rebound at 
Week 40, without non-adherence as measured by self-reported adherence or based on pill count . The 
subject had a treatment-emergent NRTI RAM (K219Q). The subject remained susceptible to all 
commercially available PIs and NRTIs included in the background regimen (i.e., AZT and 3TC). 
Adherence 
Treatment adherence to DRV/rtv was analyzed based on pill count and on the results of the Study 
Adherence Questionnaire for Caregivers and Teenagers developed by the PENTA. 
Based on pill count, 7 subjects (58.3%) were > 95% adherent to both DRV and rtv and 5 subjects 
(41.7%) were < 95% adherent to DRV/rtv over the course of the treatment period. 
Based on the PENTA Study Adherence Questionnaire for Caregivers and Teenagers, the proportion of 
subjects classified as adherent to DRV/rtv (i.e., subjects who did not miss any dose of DRV and rtv 
cumulatively up to the time point of interest) was 100% until Week 8 and 83.3% (10 subjects) at 
Week 48; and adherence to the ARVs in the background regimen was 100% until Week 16 and 91.7% 
(11 subjects) at Week 48. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
In the phase II study 12 treatment-naïve HIV-infected adolescents between 12 and < 18 years of 
age and weighing ≥ 40 kg were treated with DRV/rtv and either AZT/3TC (n=6) or ABC/3TC 
(n=6), that were selected based on resistance profile, standard of care and/or HLA B057 
determination. Tenofovir-based regimens are not approved in Europe in children and adolescents 
and could not be administered.  
These adolescents were newly infected in the preceding years, because they had a duration of 
infection of mean 3.8 years.   
Efficacy in this small sample size is comparable to that in treatment-naïve adults (83.7% in the 
ARTEMIS trial).  
Prezista 
P46 066 
Page 13/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Adherence was meager, since 5 subjects (41.7%) were < 95% adherent to DRV/rtv. Regardless 
of this poor adherence, no apparent relevant relationships were observed between DRV AUC24h 
or C0h and virologic response defined as plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 or the 
change in log10 viral load from baseline at Week 48.  
Two subjects deserve scrutiny: one (0008) was never suppressed, maybe because of non-
adherence, but PK analysis did not reveal any substantially diminished DRV concentrations. 
However, this patient seemed to be extremely sensitive to normal DRV concentrations or to 
Ritonavir, since he experienced Grade 2 disorders (nausea, vomiting).  
In addition, another subject (0011) was a rebounder, who appeared to be adherent using both 
the questionnaire and pill count, but had lowest PK values in the PK-analysis. The low 
concentrations were only marginally effective because of the reported rebound, and these low 
concentrations contradict the reported adherence performance. 
These observations in 2 from 12 subjects about conflicting outcomes and the complex mutual 
interaction of PK measures, viral suppression rates, adherence monitoring and occurrence of AEs 
should be the focus of GCP inspections of the participating study sites and subsequent 
examination of patient data. 
So far these continuous or incident viral load increases did not result in resistance mutations that 
could compromise treatment with the prescribed medication or alternative ARVs. 
7.  CLINICAL SAFETY  
Safety DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. 
Mean Exposure to DRV was 49.6 weeks. AEs were reported:  
Most common AEs were vomiting 4 (33.3%), anemia 3 (25.0%),  nausea 3 (25.0%). Two subjects had 
GI AEs considered at least possibly related to DRV: grade 1 nausea and grade 1 vomiting in 1 subject, 
and grade 2 abdominal pain, grade 2 diarrhea, and grade 2 nausea in 1 subject. Treatment was not 
discontinued. 
There were no new clinically relevant findings compared with the known DRV/rtv safety profile in HIV-1 
infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected subjects between 12 and < 18 years.  
Clinical Laboratory  
The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities of interest was low. There was a trend for an increase 
from baseline in the mean values of lipids over time. No clinically relevant mean changes from baseline 
Prezista 
P46 066 
Page 14/26 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
were observed for any other laboratory parameter. Most laboratory abnormalities were grade 1 or 2 in 
severity. Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities were only observed for hematology laboratory 
parameters: grade 4 decreased hemoglobin was observed in 2 subjects (16.7%), who were both also 
receiving AZT. One (8.3%) of these 2 subjects also had grade 4 decreased neutrophils and grade 3 
decreased WBC count. 
Cardiovascular Results  
No clinically relevant mean changes from baseline were observed for vital signs or ECG parameters. 
There were no treatment-emergent vital signs or ECG abnormalities. 
Other Safety Parameters  
There were no unexpected safety findings from the physical examinations, and no findings suggestive 
of delayed sexual maturation. 
Growth and Development  
The within-group comparison for the changes from baseline (absolute values) at Week 48 showed an 
increase versus baseline for height (3.8 cm) and weight (2.8 kg). The changes for height during the 
study were statistically significant at the 0.05 level (Wilcoxon signed rank-test) and the changes for 
weight were not statistically significant. Changes in BMI were small during the study (0.1 kg/ m2 at 
Week 48) and were not statistically significant. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
Additional safety concerns could not be identified in this small group, although Grade 2 abnormalities 
for total cholesterol were observed in 4 subjects (33.3%), and for LDL cholesterol in 3 subjects 
(25.0%). Whether these changes are contributing as an additional cardiovascular risk factor in the 
future decades of chronic treatment in these adolescents and to what quantitative extent, is currently 
unknown. Apparently, DRV concentrations were not proportionally associated with safety warnings. 
Most hematologic AEs were related to AZT. Developmental parameters demonstrated normal pubertal 
development. 
Normal growth in puberty is rapid: in US children growth during the year of Peak Height Velocity 
(PHV) in the normal female averages 9 cm/yr and varies normally from 5.4 cm to 11.2 cm. In the 
normal male, the PHV averages 10.3 cm/yr and varies normally from 5.8 cm to 13.1 cm per year.  
According to the MAH the subjects grew and gained weight according to the CDC Child Growth 
Standards, but  this change was only very modest; weight parameters were hardly affected over 1 
year of treatment. The low growth rate is related to HIV, but any additional effect of ARVs cannot be 
excluded. Comparisons of different regimens on pubertal growth spurts are lacking. 
Week 48 data did not demonstrate additional safety alerts compared to week 24 data. Lipids (total 
cholesterol and LDL) were affected in adolescents, but the clinical relevance remains to be 
determined.

8.  Conclusions 
In conclusion, the adult dose of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg QD has demonstrated antiretroviral activity in a 
limited number of treatment-naïve HIV infected adolescents 12 to <18 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg in 
combination over 48 weeks regardless of poor adherence. Safety warnings in this particular age group 
included increased lipids and relatively slow growth, but clinical relevance remains to be determined. 
The results in this limited sample of treatment-naïve adolescents confirm the PK findings, efficacy 
results and safety issues as identified in adults using this once daily dose.  The conflicting findings in 2 
from 12 paediatric subjects stress the importance of on-site examination of study data to examine the 
interaction between PK data, adherence, efficacy rates and AEs.  
A type II variation application to extend the indication based on TMC114-TÍDP29-C230 is planned for 
submission to EMA in the 2nd half of 2012.  
The assessment of the B/R in treatment-naïve HIV infected patients 3-18 yrs needs to be based on the 
full data package.  
Two concerns related to pharmacokinetics and one concern about safety in children (the clinical 
relevance of the increased lipids and relatively slow growth) are identified which should be addressed 
as part of the present Article 46 procedure.  
9.  Request for supplementary information as proposed by the 
Rapporteur 
The following concerns related to study TMC114-TÍDP-C230  should be addressed by the MAH as part 
of the present Article 46 procedure: 
1.  A adult target of range of 89.7 μg.h/ml was applied. The MAH should explain this target, as in 
study C211 (800/100 mg in adults) the population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a value 
of 87.9 μg.h/ml. 
2.  The bioanalytical report and the population pharmacokinetic analysis report could not be 
retrieved from the submitted dossier and should be submitted. 
3.  The clinical relevance of the increased lipids and relatively slow growth need to be discussed by 
the applicant. 
10.  Responses provided by the MAH on the Request for Supplementary 
Information 
Question 1 
A adult target of range of 89.7 μg.h/ml was applied. The MAH should explain this target, as 
in study C211 (800/100 mg in adults) the population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a 
value of 87.9 μg.h/ml. 
The Applicant’s Response

Page 16/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Per protocol 1, the appropriateness of the dose of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/rtv) 800/100 mg q.d. in 
treatment-naïve adolescents will be assessed by comparing the mean steady-state exposure estimates 
(AUC24h, C0h) for adolescents (obtained by empirical Bayesian feedback using the population 
pharmacokinetic model) and determining if they are within 80% to 130% of those obtained with 
DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. in adults. The population pharmacokinetic derived arithmetic mean, 
geometric mean and median DRV AUC24h in 335 adults receiving DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d. from study 
TMC114-C211 was 93.0, 89.7 and 87.9 μg.h/mL, respectively. The geometric mean was chosen as this 
best reflects the distribution of the data and is more appropriate for making comparisons. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
The MAH used the geometric mean instead of the median, which explains the difference in values. 
Question resolved. 
Question 2 
The bioanalytical report and the population pharmacokinetic analysis report could not be 
retrieved from the submitted dossier and should be submitted. 
The Applicant’s Response 
The bioanalytical report and the population pharmacokinetic analysis report are submitted with these 
responses. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
Bioanalytical report: 
The report has been submitted by the MAH. Darunavir and ritonavir were analysed with a validated LC-
MS/MS method.  
First blood sampling was on 28 September 2009 and last sample analysis was on 13 April 2011. The 
maximum storage period between collection and analysis was 562 days and was not longer than the 
current validated storage period of 1597 days for darunavir and ritonavir at -20ºC in human plasma. 
The calibration curves for darunavir and ritonavir ranged from 5 – 10000 ng/ml  and the QC samples 
had concentrations of 15, 500 and 8000 ng/ml. Run performance was within acceptance range, i.e. 
accuracy of the QCs was within 15% deviation. No concerns are identified. 
Question on bioanalytical part resolved. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis report: 
The report has been submitted by the MAH. 
A population pharmacokinetic model for darunavir in adults was already available, which had been 
previously adjusted to accommodate the difference in exposure after administration of the clinical trial 
and the commercial tablet formulation and further adjusted to accommodate data from children 
between the ages of 3 to <18 years old treated b.i.d. This adjusted model was based on richly sampled 
plasma concentration profiles obtained in the ARIEL (TMC114-C228), DELPHI (TMC114-C212) and 
DUET (TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216) trials. It is a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with 
first-order absorption with apparent oral clearance dependent on the concentration of alpha1- acid 
Prezista 
P46 066 
Page 17/26 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
glycoprotein (AAG) and body weight; and the apparent volume of the central compartment is 
dependent on body weight. The model is described in the assessment report of EMEA/H/C/707/X/41/G.  
The model is updated after inclusion of the data after once daily intake in the TMC114-C228 substudy 
and in the TMC114-C230 trial, which was implemented by pooling the richly sampled data from the 
children aged 3 to <6 years in TMC114-C228 and from the children aged 12 to <18 years in TMC114-
C230 together with the data that were used for the previous model adjustment accounting for DRV/rtv 
b.i.d. intake in children aged 3 to <18 years. 
The dataset for the TMC114-C228 q.d. substudy consisted of 10 individuals, with 59 observations after 
two weeks of treatment. The dataset for TMC114-C230 consisted of 12 individuals, with 71 
observations after two weeks of treatment. The overall dataset for the parameter estimation, including 
the data from the ARIEL, DELPHI and DUET studies, consisted of 659 observations from 102 subjects 
(72 children and 30 adults). 
The pharmacokinetic parameter values for darunavir were estimated in NONMEM using the 
paediatricpopulation PK model, i.e. a two-compartment model with a first-order absorption 
(parameterized as KA and fixed to the previously obtained value). The distribution compartment was 
parameterized in terms of apparent volume (V3/F) and apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F). 
Both V3/F and Q/F values were fixed. Equation 1 is used to describe the apparent clearance of 
darunavir as was determined previously. 
Equation 1: 
Where CL/Fi is the apparent oral clearance of an individual, CLint/F the population estimate of apparent 
intrinsic clearance, KAFF is the population estimate for the affinity of darunavir to alpha1-acid 
glycoprotein (AAG) and was fixed to its previously obtained value, θ is the influence of the individual 
weight (WTi) on apparent clearance and ηi is the individual random effect. Frel is the population 
estimate of the relative bioavailability correction for the commercial tablet formulation (Frel=1.18, 
fixed value) compared to the previously used clinical trial tablet formulation as determined in the 
original model in adults. 
For V2/F, the model was adjusted as follows: 
The model parameters are shown in the table PK 5 below.

model.

The parameter estimates obtained from the model update are shown in Table PK 6. Only slightchanges 
in the parameter estimates are observed for CL/F and V2/F, compared to the modeldeveloped for 
children from 3 to ≤18 years old after b.i.d administration. The influence of body weight on CL/F and 
V2/F was unchanged. The major impact of the model adjustment was the increase of V3/F and Q/F. 
Due to the once daily dosing, more information was gathered on these parameters, allowing their 
estimation. IIV on V2/F and V3/F on the other hand were too small to be properly estimated compared 
to the previous model. The goodness-of-fit plots for the adjusted model showed that the bias in the 
individual prediction versus the observation is minimal. 
Table PK 6: Darunavir population PK parameters after update. 
Individual parameters estimation for the substudy TMC114-228 q.d. dosing: 
Individual darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters for subjects involved in the TMC114-C228 q.d. 
substudy were derived during the population pharmacokinetic analysis described before. Simulation 
records were added to the dataset to obtain an estimation of the darunavir plasma concentrations at 
the trough where a plasma concentration was assessed. 
The goodness-of-fit plots from the model adjustment but containing only the data from the TMC114-
C228 q.d. substudy subjects shown in figure PK 1 indicate that the model predictions appear to be 
accurate, with no detectable bias present for individual predictions.

red/dark lines show the observed trend, the blue/light line the expected trend in the data. 
The arithmetic mean darunavir exposure is 120 µg.h/ml (see table PK 7) which represents 129% of the 
target (exposure arithmetic mean of 93.0 µg.h/ml in ARTEMIS study). The geometric mean darunavir 
exposure is 115 µg.h/ml which represents 128% of the target geometric mean (exposure geometric 
mean of 89.7 µg.h/ml in ARTEMIS study).  
Table PK 7. Summary statistics of the median individual pharmacokinetic parameters in the TMC114-
C228 q.d. sub-study. 
The fact that the mean exposure is on the upper side of the target may be explained by two individuals 
having a high exposure. These two subjects exhibited high AAG values and low body weight, as 
illustrated in figure PK 2, therefore, low clearances and high exposures were expected.

It can be concluded that the steady-state geometric mean exposure in the TMC114-C228 q.d. substudy 
was comparable to that of the adult population. 
Week 24 analysis and Bayesian feedback study TMC114-C230: 
The dataset for the empirical Bayes estimation at week-24 contained 115 observations from 12 
children in trial TMC114-C230. No observations were excluded from the darunavir plasma 
concentration-time analysis. 
Simulation records were added to the dataset to obtain an estimation of the plasma concentrations at 
the trough for each visit where a plasma concentration was assessed. For the determination of CL/F, 
the body weight at the visit was used, which was carried forward if no value was available at a later 
visit. Similarly, the AAG value was interpolated between visits, or carried forward if no value was 
available at a later visit. 
The goodness-of-fit plots for the feed-back analysis shown in figure PK 3 indicate that the model 
predictions appear to be accurate, with no detectable bias present for individual predictions.

Figure PK 3: Goodness-of-fit plots for the empirical Bayes estimation. The red/dark lines show the 
observed trend, the blue/light line the expected trend in the data. 
The overall summary statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters of darunavir given in table PK 8 (up to 
week 24 data), showed a geometric mean of darunavir exposure of 77.8 µg.h/ml which represents 
86.7% of the target geometric mean (exposure geometric mean of 89.7 µg.h/ml in ARTEMIS study).  
The data indicate that the applied dose of 800/100 mg DRV/RTV in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected 
adolescents resulted in an exposure at week 24 in the target range of adult patients. As concluded 
before, results at week 2, 4 and 24 were comparable to those obtained at week 48. But simulation 
data at week 48 are lacking in the submitted report. The MAH should confirm that the same model is 
used to obtain the week 48 data and explain why these data are not included in the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis report. 
Question partly resolved. Missing information should be provided at the time of submission of the type 
II variation application. 
Question 3 
The clinical relevance of the increased lipids and relatively slow growth need to be 
discussed by the applicant. 
The Applicant’s Response 
Dyslipidemia, including elevations in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, is a common comorbidity in 
HIV-1 infected individuals, including pediatric patients. Lipid abnormalities can occur in up to 62% of 
children infected with HIV. Among HIV-infected children, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia was 
up to 13% compared with 4.8% in HIV-uninfected children. 
Although the full consequences of dyslipidemia are not known for these children and adolescents 
receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), they do appear to be at greater risk of 
Prezista 
P46 066 
Page 22/26 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
development of atheroma and cardiovascular disease, similar to adults. It is generally accepted that 
HAART contributes to the metabolic abnormalities manifested in these patients, but it is not the sole 
etiology, as many of the same metabolic derangements have been reported in HIV-infected individuals 
not receiving HAART. When choosing whether or not to treat a patient with HAART, and when choosing 
what agents to use, the health care provider, patient, and parent/guardian must weigh multiple 
potential risks and benefits. Although various lipid abnormalities are known adverse drug reactions for 
HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) as a class, among the boosted PIs, atazanavir and DRV appear to have 
the most favorable lipid side-effect profile. 
The true risk of hyperlipidemia on the development of cardiovascular disease requires long-term 
follow-up, which is not feasible within the setting of a clinical study. The Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) is conducting a long-term pharmacovigilance study through the European Pregnancy and 
Paediatric HIV Cohort Collaboration (EPPICC) of the Paediatric European Network for Treatment of 
AIDS (PENTA) and has a commitment to provide annual reports. 
Hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia are listed adverse drug reactions in the SmPC and should be 
monitored and treatment initiated according to generally accepted recommendations for the treatment 
of lipid abnormalities. 
Poor growth is well documented in pediatric patients with HIV, and can be manifested as either an 
abnormality of height, weight or both. Impaired growth has been observed in up to 22% of HIV-
infected children whereas bone age delay was observed in up to 33%. In addition, abnormalities of 
growth, pubertal progression, or both had been manifested in 43% of HIVinfected children. Several 
factors can contribute, including, but not limited to psychosocial factors, endocrine abnormalities, 
anorexia, altered energy/nitrogen balance, and micronutrient deficiencies. 
The overall impact of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has been a remarkably improved growth in HIV-
infected pediatric patients. However, impaired growth does occur in some children receiving ARV 
therapy, its cause being multifactorial. This raises the possibility that ARV therapy itself could be a 
contributing factor. There is a well-accepted association between ARV therapy and lipodystrophy, and 
different classes tend to be more strongly associated with specific manifestations of lipodystrophy, 
whether lipoatrophy or fat accumulation. This suggests that the effects ARVs have on growth 
impairment could be class dependent. When the effect of specific ARVs on lipodystrophy was studied in 
the past, the need to utilize several agents together in a cocktail limits the ability to discern the effect 
of any one single agent on growth. There are no conclusive data that demonstrate preferential effects 
of one PI over another regarding growth in the HIV-infected adolescents. 
From the literature, it is known that PI-containing combination therapies may have both positive 
effects on height and weight due to improvements in metabolism and nutrient absorption and negative 
effects resulting from diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. In study TMC114-TiDP29-C230, 
vomiting (33.3%), nausea (25.0%), and diarrhea (16.7%) have been observed, of which the majority 
were grade 1 or 2 in severity, none were considered serious, and none led to treatment 
discontinuation. The gastrointestinal AEs observed were thus not of a level that these would have 
prevented growth improvement. 
When interpreting changes in growth parameters in study TMC114-TiDP29-C230, making comparison 
to the WHO growth charts is considered to be a conservative comparison given that these growth 
charts are based on healthy children. The mean age-adjusted z-scores at baseline indicated that the 
subjects were below the normal population median with respect to height (-0.36) and weight (-0.10), 
while not for body mass index (BMI) (0.06). In addition, approximately half of the subjects were HIV-
infected since birth and therefore have been deprived of HAART for at least 12 years. It has been 
Prezista 
P46 066 
Page 23/26 
 
 
  
 
 
 
documented that early ages have been associated with better catch-up in weight and height, and that 
increases in height are less pronounced when HAART is initiated later. After the start of treatment with 
DRV/rtv 800/100 mg q.d., subjects continued to grow, relative to what was expected, but did not 
clearly catch up from the growth retardation at baseline. The within-group comparison for the changes 
from baseline for the age-adjusted z-scores at Week 48 showed small mean increases for height 
(0.14), and small mean decreases for weight (-0.08) and BMI (-0.20), none of which were statistically 
significant. Significant increases in BMI have not been observed in other studies. 
This may be related to the fact that children in contrast to adults increase their height parallel to their 
weight, and therefore, their BMI remains stable. Lower height z-scores than weight z-scores at 
baseline before the introduction of PIs suggest that HIV disease has a more pronounced effect on 
height than weight, and that children may have more opportunity to improve in height than weight 
growth. This may explain why a somewhat greater beneficial effect on height than on weight has been 
observed. 
In the treatment-experienced population of children and adolescents treated with DRV/rtv 600/100 mg 
b.i.d. in study TMC114-C212, no impairment of growth was observed. In the Week-48 analysis of this 
study, the age-adjusted z-score values at baseline indicated that, on average, subjects were below the 
normal population median value with respect to BMI (mean: -0.7), height (mean: -1.4), and weight 
(mean: -1.4). Following initiation of treatment, a rapid and significant response was seen with respect 
to the weight, BMI, and height aged-adjusted z-scores. This positive trend was confirmed in the final 
analyses. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
Lipids 
With the advent of new HIV-treatment options in children and adolescents a more selective approach 
of pediatricians can be adopted in the selection of a regimen to balance antiviral activity and adverse 
events associated with ARVs. Metabolic influences of ARVs on growth, lipodystrophy/fat abnormalities, 
hyperlipidemia, bone turnover and cognitive development in this age group need to be documented 
not only for DRV but also for other ARVs as well. The efforts of the MAH and EPPICC network in this 
respect are essential to allow comparison of different treatment regimens in children and adolescents 
also in the long term.  
The MAH is requested to include the metabolic evaluation of the effect of DRV in children and 
adolescents in the forthcoming type II variation using the same parameters as have been documented 
in study TMC114-TÍDP29-C230. Comparison of these outcomes to those obtained in children on other 
regimens will be encouraged. Next to these short-term 48 week data or at most 96 week required for 
registration, hopefully additional long-term data will come available to appreciate metabolic changes 
in children and adolescents to full extent. These data will be collected in Post-marketing surveillance. 
Growth 
Much in the same line as mentioned above, the multifactorial causes of growth impairment in HIV 
infected children need to be evaluated and comparison between regimens is essential to appreciate 
the potential contribution of ART as a detrimental factor.  
That also implies larger sample sizes than the currently submitted study in 12 treatment-naïve 
adolescents that will not allow reliable comparison between distinct ARVs and growth parameters in 
this age group. The results of the variation in the second half of 2012 are awaited to explore the 
effect of 1) viral suppression, 2) delayed initiation of cART and 3) ARV therapy itself (e.g. 
Prezista 
P46 066

malabsorption due to gastrointestinal adverse events associated with PIs)  on growth parameters in 
all children and adolescents who have been prescribed DRV. 
11.  Conclusions 
After review of the data on pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy from study TMC114-TÍDP-C230, the 
Rapporteur  considered that the article 46 paediatric study submission is fulfilled. However, further 
data are expected in the context of a variation application, prior any final conclusion is made. 
Indeed, three concerns were expressed during the first part of the Article 46 procedure. Assessment of 
the MAH’s responses on the two concerns related to pharmacokinetics from study TMC114-TÍDP-C230 
and one concern about safety in children led to the following conclusions: 
Pharmacokinetics: 
- 
The data of the submitted population pharmacokinetic analysis in the response document 
indicate that the applied dose of 800/100 mg DRV/RTV in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected 
adolescents resulted in an exposure at week 24 in the target range of adult patients. As 
concluded before, results at week 2, 4 and 24 were comparable to those obtained at week 48. 
But simulation data at week 48 are lacking in the submitted report. The MAH should confirm 
that the same model is used to obtain the week 48 data and explain why these data are not 
included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis report. This missing information should be 
provided at the time of submission of the type II variation application. 
- 
The following aspects should be considered by the MAH for the submission of the planned Type 
II variation regarding the paediatric indication (treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients of 3 to 
<18 years of age): 
1.  The current best practice of model qualification involves simulation based diagnostics, 
e.g. Visual Predictive Check. The MAH should use prediction corrected VPCs stratified 
by AAG level, body weight and age to qualify the combined adult and paediatric model. 
2.  Since total plasma concentration (Ctot) is confounded by AAG it would be useful to 
have the calculated unbound exposure (AUCu) presented in addition to AUCtot in order 
to facilitate comparison between exposures in different subgroups. 
Safety: 
- 
The MAH is requested to include the metabolic evaluation of the effect of DRV in children and 
adolescents in the forthcoming type II variation using the same parameters as have been 
documented in study TMC114-TÍDP29-C230. Comparison of these outcomes to those obtained 
in children on other regimens will be encouraged. 
- 
The results of the variation in the second half of 2012 are awaited to explore the effect of 1) 
viral suppression, 2) delayed initiation of cART and 3) ARV therapy itself (e.g. malabsorption 
due to gastrointestinal adverse events associated with PIs)  on growth parameters in all 
children and adolescents who have been prescribed DRV.

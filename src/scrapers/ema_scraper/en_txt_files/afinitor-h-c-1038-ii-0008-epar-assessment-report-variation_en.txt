1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) comprise a group of neoplasms derived from peptide- and amine-
producing cells of the neuroendocrine system.  They are characterised histologically by the intracellular 
presence of markers of endocrine tissue, such as chromogranin A (CgA), synaptophysin, and neuron-
specific enolase.  NETs may be classified according to their embryological origin, as arising from the 
foregut (e.g., bronchial or gastric carcinoid), midgut (e.g., small intestine or appendiceal carcinoid), or 
hindgut (e.g., colon or rectal carcinoid).  NETs are broadly subcategorised into functional and 
nonfunctional tumours and are usually subclassified as carcinoid tumours (NETs with carcinoid 
syndrome) or pancreatic NETs.  The term ‘carcinoid’ is typically used to describe a well- to moderately-
differentiated NET arising outside the pancreas. The number of persons affected by the condition in the 
Community was estimated to be approximately 1.8 in 10,000.  
The main primary sites of origin for NETs are the gastrointestinal tract (62% to 67%) and the lung 
(22% to 27%). Those arising from the pancreas are recognized to have a different genetic profile, 
more aggressive clinical course, and different pattern of response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Midgut 
tumours are considered the classic tumour associated with carcinoid syndrome and are more 
commonly symptomatic.  In contrast, the majority of pancreatic NETs are nonfunctional tumours. 
Overall, 40% to 60% of patients with NET are asymptomatic at presentation.  Approximately 40% of 
patients have advanced disease at initial presentation, with up to 75% with liver metastases at the 
time of diagnosis.   
Advanced NETs are considered incurable.  Stage of disease significantly influences the prognosis, with 
the best 5-year survival rate in localized disease (93%) and a poor 5-year survival rate in distant 
metastatic disease.  Median overall survival (OS) from the date of initial diagnosis among patients with 
metastatic well- to moderately-differentiated NETs of the small bowel, cecum, appendix, rectum, lung, 
and colon are 65, 55, 31, 26, 17, and 7 months, respectively1.  Median OS for metastatic pancreatic 
NET has been reported to be 17 months2. 
Management of NETs is generally guided by histology.  High-grade or poorly-differentiated NETs have 
an aggressive course, and their management parallels that of small-cell lung cancer.  Well- to 
moderately-differentiated NETs are considered to be more indolent but are resistant to most cytotoxic 
agents. For advanced NETs, therapeutic options focus on controlling the hormonal syndrome and

inhibiting tumour growth.  Recently, sunitinib has been approved in the EU for the treatment of 
unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours with disease 
progression in adults. Other treatments include somatostatin analogues (SSAs), angiogenesis 
inhibitors, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, interferon (IFN), surgical resection and embolisation of 
hepatic metastases. Peptide receptor radiotherapy (radiolabeled therapy) represents an additional 
option available in a limited number of medical centres.  At present, surgery is the only curative 
treatment for NETs. 
Everolimus, a derivative of rapamycin, acts as a signal transduction inhibitor, selectively inhibiting the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key serine-threonine kinase regulating protein synthesis 
and ultimately cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and survival.  mTOR is a component in the 
PI3K/AKT /mTOR pathway known to be deregulated in numerous human cancers.  A role for 
everolimus has been suggested by the regulatory role of mTOR in cell growth, metabolism and protein 
translation, coupled with the observation that the PI3K/mTOR pathway is activated by insulin-like 
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in NETs.  Everolimus may play a role in inhibiting hormonal hypersecretion, 
cell growth, and NET proliferation by interrupting the IGF-1/PI3K/mTOR signalling cascade. 
On  05/06/2007  and  14/11/2007,  orphan  designations  EU/3/07/449  and  EU/3/07/488  were  granted 
by  the  European  Commission  for  everolimus  for  the  conditions  of  renal  cell  carcinoma  and  gastro-
entero-pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumours,  respectively.  Further  to  request  of  the  applicant,  these 
orphan designations were withdrawn from the Community Register on 18/07/11.  
Everolimus is approved in Europe since 2003 under the trade name of Certican for the prophylaxis of 
organ rejection in adult patients following allogeneic renal or cardiac transplant. 
Afinitor (everolimus) was approved on 3 August 2009 for the “treatment of patients with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) whose disease has progressed on or after treatment with VEGF-targeted 
treatment”. 
In this type II variation (C.I.6.a), the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) of Afinitor applied for a 
new indication in the treatment of patients with advanced gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumours. 
Further to the assessment as discussed below, the approved indication was the following: Afinitor is 
indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well- or moderately-differentiated 
neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin in adults with progressive disease. Consequently, sections 
4.1, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics and the Package Leaflet have 
been updated. Annex II has been updated to the new template. The MAH also took the opportunity to 
update the product information in line with the QRD template (version 7.3.1) and minor corrections. 
No orphan medicinal product is authorised for the same therapeutic indication.  
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included EMA 
decisions (P/2/2007 and P/67/2008) on the granting of product specific waivers. 
1.2.  Non-Clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical study reports have been submitted by the MAH to support the application. The 
MAH provided an addendum to the non-clinical overview containing bibliographical references based on 
published literature.

Page 3/54
 
 
 
 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Due to absence of local, national or international databases in EU, the MAH has performed a calculation 
of PEC based on prevalence data of NETs in white populations in US. Assuming a maximum prevalence 
of malignant and benign NETs in the EU population of 4.7 per 10000 persons, the calculated 
PECsurface water was 0.00235 μg/L which is below the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L for a Phase II Tier A 
assessment. Considering that everolimus has previously been approved for an orphan indication (renal 
cell carcinoma, prevalence 1.04 in 10000) the resulting PEC values have been added, resulting in an 
overall PEC of 0.00461 μg/L. The environmental risk assessment report was updated to include the 
predicted maximum annual amount of everolimus in the transplantation setting (Certican) for the next 
five years. The resulting overall PECsurface water was 0.00474, which was below the trigger for a 
Phase II – Tier A assessment. Therefore, a Phase II assessment is not considered necessary. 
Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical study reports have been submitted by the MAH. This is considered acceptable for 
the proposed new indication. The non-clinical review performed by the MAH contains recent 
publications on the pharmacology of everolimus. The anti-angiogenic properties of everolimus are well-
known. In addition, a number of studies showing in vitro activity of everolimus with neuroendocrine 
cell lines have been presented. However, other data have shown a poor correlation between in vitro 
and in vivo sensitivities to everolimus. 
With regards to the environmental risk assessment, the predicted environmental concentration of 
everolimus is below the trigger value for a phase II assessment (10 ng/l) when considering the 
prevalence of renal cell carcinoma and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours in the EU 
population. Referring to the logKow of 4, PBT assessment is not necessary. The medicinal product 
Afinitor is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment when considering the prevalence of renal cell 
carcinoma and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (Afinitor was designated as orphan drug 
in each of the indication, the orphan designations were subsequently withdrawn) and that the trigger 
PEC surface value including the transplantation indication was below the trigger for a Phase II –Tier A 
assessment.  
In conclusion, the available non-clinical information is considered sufficient for the new indication and 
the current information provided in the SmPC is considered adequate. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
The application is based on the clinical development program of everolimus in advanced 
neuroendocrine tumours CNETs that consists in three studies:

efficacy 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
According to the MAH, all trials in the everolimus NET clinical development program were conducted in 
full compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
The CHMP were consulted on the clinical development of everolimus for the treatment of patients with 
advanced NET. The CHMP issued a scientific advice and considered the extent of the program to be 
acceptable, and agreed to the study design of the pivotal phase-III trials. For the pivotal study C2324  
the clinical endpoints, and their methods of assessment are considered appropriate.   
1.3.1.  Clinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
To support the current application for the treatment of advanced NET, pharmacokinetic data were 
obtained from the two pivotal phase-III studies, C2324 and C2325 (Table 1).  Additional predose 
everolimus pharmacokinetic samples were collected in the supportive phase-II study (C2239).

Patients in  study C2324 received everolimus 10 mg/day plus best supportive care. The everolimus 
dose could be reduced to 5 mg/day. Full PK profiles were obtained from a small subset of patients. 
Predose (C min) samples were drawn in other patients.  
The pharmacokinetic results from the patients with full PK profiles are shown in Table 2.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
  Effects of co-administration of somatostatin analogues on everolimus exposure 
Octreotide is a synthetic octapeptide analogue of somatostatin. The potential of octreotide at different 
concentrations to inhibit human CYP enzyme activity was assessed in pooled human liver microsomes 
in vitro.  Low to no inhibition by octreotide (up to 20 μM) and no time-dependent inhibition of all CYP 
enzymes tested was observed.  
The effect of somatostatin or somatostatin analogue therapy on everolimus pharmacokinetics in vivo 
was evaluated in the Phase III Study C2324 and the Phase II study C2239, by comparing everolimus 
C min levels from patients with and without concomitant somatostatin therapy.  
Patients in study C2239 received everolimus 10 mg/day as monotherapy (Stratum 1) or with 
octreotide every 28th day (Stratum 2).  The normal dose was 20 mg every 28th day, but it could be 
reduced to 10 mg or increased to 30 mg every 28th day. Serial blood samples for steady-state full 
everolimus PK profile were collected from 11 patients at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 24 hours post-dose. 
Pre-dose blood sample for concentration determination of octreotide in plasma were collected for all 
patients on Day 1 of every cycle at predose and on Day 15 of Cycle 1.  The effect of octreotide on the 
C min of everolimus was assessed by comparing the log-transformed Cmin of everolimus in Stratum 1 
and Stratum 2 at Cycle 1 Day 15 by using an ANOVA model adjusted for the stratum as a fixed eff
ect 
(Table 6).

  Effect of co-administration of everolimus on octreotide exposure  
Coadministration of everolimus and depot octreotide in Study C2325 increased octreotide Cmin with a 
geometric mean ratio (everolimus/placebo) of 1.47 (90% CI: 1.32, 1.64).   
Special populations 
Race 
In study C2324, it appeared that mean Cmin values after the 5 mg and 10 mg daily dose were slightly 
higher in Japanese patients (8.87 ng/ml, 95%CI 6.93-11.3; 17.0 ng/ml, 95%CI 14.1-20.5) than in 
non-Japanese patients (5.45 ng/ml, 95%CI 4.95-5.98; 10.8 ng/ml, 95%CI 10.0-11.5). 
Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic data were derived from Studies C2324 and C2325. 
Exposure-response relationship 
Results of the Cox regression of the relationship between risk ratio for PFS and time-normalised 
everolimus Cmin suggested a trend of longer PFS with higher everolimus Cmin values for studies C2324 
(risk ratio = 0.73 [95% CI: 0.50-1.08]) and C2325 (risk ratio 0.66; 95% CI: 0.40 to 1.08). 
The relationship between clinically notable adverse events and everolimus Cmin was explored using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology. Time-normalised everolimus Cmin was divided into three categories, 
corresponding to trough concentrations of < 10 ng/mL, 10-30 ng/mL, and > 30 ng/mL. The 
relationship between everolimus Cmin and time to first clinically notable AE was also investigated by a 
Cox regression model including the log-transformed time-normalised everolimus C min as a covariate. 
For study C2324, the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses of everolimus Cmin and safety 
variables showed a trend for stomatitis/oral mucositis/ulcers and renal events. However, for study 
C2325, no notable adverse events were observed.   
Exposure-response relationship - Co-administration of everolimus and octreotide 
The correlation between tumour size reduction and octreotide Cmin values was evaluated using a 
marginal generalised linear mixed model. The analysis showed a probability of tumour size reduction 
with odds ratios of 0.992 and 0.999, for a 1.5 fold increase in octreotide Cmin in the everolimus and 
placebo arm, respectively.  
The relationship between octreotide exposure and PFS was investigated by a Cox regression model. In 
the everolimus plus octreotide treatment arm, the overall impact of octreotide log-Cmin on PFS was not 
statistically significant (p=0.17). In the placebo arm, where octreotide was administered alone, the 
impact of octreotide exposure on PFS was not statistically significant (HR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.03, 
p=0.13). In addition, the HRs for PFS when increasing the octreotide concentration by 1.5-fold in the

octreotide resistant patients and in patients who were octreotide-naive or responding to octreotide 
compared to the total patient population is shown in Table 7.

Discussion and Conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has provided pharmacokinetic data in support of the applied indication obtained from the two 
pivotal phase-III studies (C2324 and C2325) and data from additional predose pharmacokinetic 
samples that were collected from the supportive phase-II study (C2239). No new information has been 
provided on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion of everolimus. The recommendation in 
the SmPC to take everolimus consistently either with or without food remained the same. In study 
C2324, the recommendation was to take everolimus at the same time as or immediately after a meal. 
This was not expected to have led to a clinically relevant difference in overall exposure to everolimus 
and outcome in the trial.  With regards to pharmacokinetic in special population, the recommendation 
remained the same as in the currently approved indication. Everolimus dose should be reduced to 5 
mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) and is not recommended for use 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
The MAH presented data on pharmacokinetic interactions. In studies C2324 and C2325, Cmin values 
were analysed separately for patients with or without co-administration of CYP3A4/PgP substrates, 
inhibitors, or inducers. In general, there were no apparent differences between the groups for CYP3A4 
substrates, inhibitors and inducers. These results suggest that octreotide is not expected to inhibit the 
metabolic clearance of co-medications metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. However, due to small sample sizes, especially for inhibitors 
of CYP3A4 or Pgp, data should be interpreted with caution. The current SmPC warnings and 
interactions for CYP3A4 and Pgp are considered appropriate for the NET indication. 
The data from study C2325 indicate no expected effect of octreotide on CYP-mediated clearance of 
everolimus as mean steady state levels of octreotide were reported to be around 5 ng/ml or 
approximately 0.005 μM.   In study C2324, the minor increase seen in everolimus Cmin at concomitant 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 9/54
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
octreotide administration is not considered clinically relevant. A new sentence in section 4.5 of the 
SmPC has been included to highlight the lack of significant effect of octreotide on the efficacy response 
to everolimus patients with advanced NETs “Co-administration of everolimus and depot octreotide 
increased octreotide Cmin with a geometric mean ratio (everolimus/placebo) of 1.47.  A clinically 
significant effect on the efficacy response to everolimus in patients with advanced neuroendocrine 
tumours could not be established.”  
In a Cox regression model, relationship between HR for PFS and everolimus Cmin suggested an increase 
in PFS with higher Cmin values.  The impact of octreotide and everolimus exposure on HR of PFS was 
analogous to one another when the drugs were coadministered. The risk for progression was 
consistently reduced for a 2-fold increase in everolimus exposure at both octreotide Cmin of 4 and 6 
ng/mL, suggesting that everolimus maintained a positive impact on PFS irrespective of octreotide 
exposure.  
The relationship between log-transformed everolimus Cmin and biomarkers CgA and 5-HIAA were 
investigated by fitting a linear mixed model to CgA and 5-HIAA values separately. There was no 
apparent relationship between log-transformed Cmin and the biomarkers CgA.  
1.3.2.  Clinical Efficacy 
Dose response study 
There were no study reports submitted on dose response. 
Main study 
Study C2324: A randomized double-blind phase III study of RAD001 10 mg/d plus best 
supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care in the treatment of 
patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) 
The study C2324 was a phase-III, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomised, placebo-
controlled study. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
The key inclusion criteria were: 
-  Advanced (unresectable or metastatic) biopsy-proven pancreatic NET   
-  Radiological documentation of progression of disease within 12 months prior to randomisation. If 
the patient received anti-tumour therapy during the past 12 months, he/she must have 
radiological documentation of progression of disease while on or after receiving the therapy. 
-  Confirmed low-grade or intermediate-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma 
-  Measurable disease per RECIST using triphasic computed tomography (CT) scan or multiphase 
MRI for radiologic assessment 
The key exclusion criteria were:  
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 10/54
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, 
adenocarcinoid, goblet cell carcinoid, or small-cell carcinoma 
-  Cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to randomisation 
-  Hepatic artery embolization within the last 6 months (1 month if there were other sites of 
measurable disease), or cryoablation/radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastasis within 2 
months of enrolment 
- 
Prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus) 
Treatments 
A 10 mg dose of everolimus or matching placebo was given by continuous oral daily dosing of two 5 
mg tablets. 
Concomitant treatments  
Best supportive care deemed necessary for patients by the treating physician included the use of 
somatostatin analogs; proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) for gastrinoma; diazoxide, or feeding tube for 
insulinoma; pancrealipase (lipase, protease, and amylase) for patients with pancreatic exocrine 
insufficiency; and non-specific anti-diarrheals (loperamide); opiates; etc. 
Treatment duration and cross-over 
Patients were treated with blinded study treatment (everolimus or matching placebo) until objective 
tumour progression was documented per RECIST (by the investigator) or until any other protocol-
specified reason for treatment discontinuation was determined. During the double-blind phase of the 
study, tumour assessments were performed by the local radiologist and sent for central review until 
the patient started a new anti-tumour therapy. 
Once radiological disease progression was documented by the local radiologist, the treating oncologist 
could unmask the treatment.  Patients in the placebo group could be offered treatment with 
everolimus. For the open-label phase of the study, tumour assessments were required to be assessed 
locally and were not sent for central review. All patients who received open-label treatment with 
everolimus continued to have safety and efficacy assessments as in the double-blind phase of the trial.  
Patients who had not progressed at the time of discontinuation of study treatment were to be followed 
with tumour assessments. The study site was to continue to send radiological assessments for central 
review. In addition, radiological assessments were to be sent for central review for patients with 
disease progression (as assessed by the local investigator) who had not started on new anti-tumour 
therapy (including open label everolimus). 
In addition, patients were followed for safety until at least 28 days after study treatment 
discontinuation and for survival until the final survival analysis.

endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable of this study was progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time 
from the date of randomisation to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to 
any cause. If a patient had not progressed or had died at the date of the analysis cut-off or when 
he/she received any further anti-cancer therapy, PFS was censored at the time of the last tumour 
assessment before the cut-off date or the other anti-cancer therapy date. For the primary analysis, PFS 
was based on data from the local investigator assessment in accordance with RECIST.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints were overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). 
Overall survival was defined as the time from date of randomisation to the date of death due to any 
cause. If a patient was not known to have died, survival was censored at the date of last contact.  
Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and collecting all AEs, SAEs with their severity and 
relationship to study drug, and pregnancies. They included the regular monitoring of hematology, 
blood chemistry and urine and regular assessments of vital signs, and physical examination. 
In order to monitor for non-infectious pneumonitis, chest X-Rays or chest CT were performed at 
screening, at regular intervals during efficacy assessments and as clinically indicated, and at the end of 
the study. Additional workup included pulmonary function tests and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) and/or biopsy was performed per the discretion of the investigator if there was evidence 
of non-infectious pneumonitis. 
Efficacy assessments - Radiologic tumour assessment 
Tumours evaluations were done at baseline and every 12 weeks while on study. Investigators were 
required to use the same methods for assessment and technique. 
All patients at baseline were to have at least one measurable disease lesion by triphasic CT or 
multiphase MRI. The multiphase CT scan consisted of 3 specific timepoints: pre-contrast, arterial, and 
finally portal venous phase; multiphase MRI was acceptable for patients in whom contrast was 
contraindicated. Measurable disease lesions were to have at least one dimension with the longest 
diameter 20 mm using conventional techniques or 10 mm with spiral CT scan (with minimum lesion

size no less than double the slice thickness). All baseline, evaluations were performed as closely as 
possible to initiating study treatment, never more than 28 days before treatment began. 
Each centre had a designated radiologist or other physician who was responsible for the interpretation 
of radiological evaluations, i.e., the same radiologist/physician performed the evaluation. 
Response and progression evaluation were performed according to RECIST and were based exclusively 
on radiological findings obtained at tumour evaluations.  
If there was clinical suspicion of disease progression at any time, a physical examination and 
radiological confirmation were required to be performed promptly rather than waiting for the next 
scheduled radiological assessment. Initially, radiological evaluations were performed by a local 
radiologist or responsible physician and all were reviewed by an Independent Central Radiology Review 
as specified within the Independent Review Charter. 
Sample size 
Using an unstratified log-rank test at the one-sided 2.5% significance level, a total of 282 events was 
needed to allow for at least 92.6% power to demonstrate a 33% risk reduction (HR for 
everolimus/placebo of about 0.67, as calculated from an anticipated 50% increase in median PFS, from 
6 to 9 months in the everolimus group compared to the placebo group). 
It was planned that a uniform accrual of approximately 23 patients per month over 74 weeks with a 
minimum follow-up of 39 weeks for a total of 352 patients would be required to obtain 282 PFS events. 
It was estimated that 10% of patients would be lost to follow-up; thus, a total sample size of 392 
patients were to be randomised. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was stratified by whether or not patients received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and by 
WHO performance status (0 versus 1 or 2) at baseline.  
Blinding (masking) 
Randomisation data were kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding at progression of disease 
and at time of final analyses, and were not accessible to anyone involved in the conduct of the study 
with the exception of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee who performed an ongoing safety 
review; and the identity of the treatments was concealed by use of study drugs (everolimus and 
matching placebo) that were all identical in packaging, labelling, appearance, and schedule of 
administration. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis was performed in the FAS population and based on the local investigator 
assessments. The primary analysis was analysed using a stratified one-sided log-rank test. The test 
was stratified by whether or not patients had received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and by WHO 
performance status (0 versus 1 or 2) at baseline. 
PFS was censored at the last adequate tumour assessment if one of the following occurred: 
(a) absence of an event; (b) the event occurred after a new anticancer therapy (including open-label 
everolimus) was given; or (c) the event occurred after two or more missing tumour assessments. PFS 
was not censored for any other reason; and in particular, not for a discontinuation from the study 
medication (for any reason). 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 13/54
 
 
 
 
The treatment effect estimate, i.e., hazard ratio (HR) with the 95% CI, for the primary analysis based 
on local investigator assessments of PFS, was obtained from a stratified Cox proportional hazard model 
(unadjusted for any other covariates) using the same stratification factors as the log-rank test. 
By default, if disease progression or death was documented after one single missing tumour 
assessment, the actual event date of disease progression/death was used for the PFS event date. If 
disease progression was documented after two or more missing tumour assessments, the PFS time of 
these patients was censored at the date of the last tumour assessment with overall lesion response of 
CR, PR, or stable disease.

Participant flow 
Patient disposition for the full analysis set is presented in Table 9.

Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled from 82 sites worldwide in the US, Canada, Brazil, EU (Germany, Spain, 
Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Slovakia (Slovak Republic), Sweden, United Kingdom), 
Switzerland and Asia (Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Thailand).  
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended once (on 22 January 2010). The primary efficacy analysis in 
Study C2324, which was originally planned as PFS as per independent central radiology review (IRC), 
was formally amended to PFS as per the local investigator assessment (INV) following a blinded review 
of the number of PFS events. 
Independent Central Radiology Review included radiology assessment by an Independent Review 
Committee (IRC) and - following amendment 1 - as needed, by an Independent Adjudication 
Committee (IAC). 
- 
The IRC was constituted by teams of two board-certified independent radiologists who reviewed 
radiological images from investigational sites on an ongoing basis. Discrepancies between the 
two central readers were adjudicated. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 14/54
 
 
 
 
 
- 
The IAC was constituted by a board certified radiologist and oncologist both with experience in 
NET. Adjudication was performed in a blinded manner so that committee members had no 
knowledge of study treatment assignment or origin of RECIST evaluations (i.e., local or central). 
Major protocol violations concerned the lack of documented progression or lack of documentation of 
well to moderately differentiated histology (Table 10).

Numbers analysed 
Four hundred ten (410) patients were randomised and constituted the Full Analysis Set (FAS); 207 
patients were assigned to treatment with everolimus and 203 patients were randomised to placebo. 
Out of 410 patients, 407 (99.3%) patients received at least one dose of study medication and had at 
least one post-baseline safety assessment and thus, constituted the Safety Set.  The other 3 patients 
either withdrew informed consent or were randomised incorrectly and did not receive study 
medication.  The analysis sets (FAS, Safety, per-protocol set [PP], open label set [OL]) are described in 
Table 15. 
Table 15: 
Analysis Sets – Study C2324 
Within the FAS, 39 patients were excluded from the PP Set due to: insufficient everolimus exposure 
(n=18), unknown overall response based on investigator review (n=17), or major protocol deviations 
(n=13). An additional 26 patients who were not major protocol deviators were also excluded from the 
PP Set.  
There were 149 (36.3%) patients who entered the open-label phase and thus constituted the OL; all 
but one of these patients received placebo during the double-blind phase.

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted when 274 PFS events had occurred in the double-blind 
treatment phase of the study (corresponding to a data cut-off date of 28-Feb-2010). Median study 
follow-up was 17.0 months.

 Secondary endpoints 
Overall survival 
No statistically significant difference was observed between the two treatment groups in terms of OS 
(Figure 2 and Table 17). Crossover occurred for 148 of the 203 patients (72.9%) initially randomised 
to placebo prior to the data cut-off (and for 148 of 163 patients receiving placebo therapy who had 
disease progression and were thus eligible for crossover).

Supportive studies 
C2325: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III 
study in patients with advanced carcinoid tumour receiving Sandostatin LAR 
Depot and RAD001 10 mg/d or Sandostatin LAR Depot and placebo 
The study C2325 was a randomised, double-blind, Phase III study in patients with advanced NETs with 
a history of carcinoid tumours (advanced [unresectable or metastatic] biopsy-proven carcinoid 
tumour). Participants in the study were receiving everolimus or placebo with concomitant octreotide 
depot 30 mg intramuscularly (i.m.) every 28 days. After documented radiological progression, patients 
could be unblinded by the investigator: placebo randomised patients were able to cross over to receive 
open-label everolimus plus depot octreotide. The inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study participants, 
and the study design were similar to those of study C2324.  The treatment regimen included the 
mandatory concomitant octreotide treatment. The planned primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by 
IRC, key secondary endpoints were PFS as assessed by the local investigator, overall survival and 
overall response rate and safety. 
A sample size of 390 randomised patients was originally planned. As a consequence of a marked 
slowing in PFS events and issues with informative censoring affecting the central radiology PFS, the 
final analysis was performed at a predefined fixed calendar time-point (02 April 2010 cut-off) 
irrespective of the number of PFS events observed and based on a the assessment of the IAC. Four 
hundred ten (429) patients were randomised and constituted the FAS. Of these, 216 patients were 
assigned to treatment with everolimus + octreotide and 213 patients were randomised to placebo + 
octreotide. Of these, 426 (99.3%) patients received at least one dose of study medication and had at 
least one post-baseline safety assessment and thus, constituted the Safety Set. 
In general, demographic and disease characteristics were relatively well-balanced between the two 
treatment groups, with the exception of important baseline prognostic factors such as WHO 
performance status 1 and lung carcinoids which were more frequently enrolled in the everolimus arm 
compared to the placebo arm (Table 20).

Table 20: 
Disease baseline characteristics – Study C2325 
There were some imbalances in the proportion of patients offered subsequent somatostatin analogues 
therapy post-disease progression. There were 59.6% and 42.1% of patients randomised to placebo 
and everolimus, respectively that received depot octreotide. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary endpoint PFS (as per IAC assessment) required the boundary for statistical significance of 
p=0.0246 due to changes in the analyses plan. The primary analysis did not meet this primary 
endpoint with one-sided p=0.026. The results of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (PFS by 
IAC, PFS by INV and PFS by IRC, OS and ORR) for both treatment arms are presented in Figure 4, 5, 
and Table 21 and 22.

Open-label phase of C2324  
A retrospective analysis of patients who crossed-over to everolimus therapy indicated that median PFS 
following crossover was 11.43 months. These results are similar to the 11.04 months for patients 
initially randomised to everolimus in the C2324 initial randomised, controlled phase of the study (INV). 
Study C2239 
Study C2239 is a phase-II, international, multicenter, open-label trial that was designed to valuate the 
efficacy and safety of everolimus 10 mg in patients with pancreatic NET whose disease had progressed 
(by RECIST) after failure of prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Stratum 1 consisted of 115 patients receiving everolimus 10 mg. Stratum 2 constituted 45 patients 
whose disease had progressed during treatment with depot octreotide and who continued with their 
entry dose of depot octreotide in addition to everolimus 10 mg daily. Objective response rate in 
Stratum 1 was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were response duration, PFS, and OS.  
Objective tumour response as per independent central review, based on RECIST, was documented in 
9.6% of patients (95% CI: 4.9% –16.5%) from Stratum 1 and 4.4% (95% CI: 0.5% – 15.1%) in 
Stratum 2, while disease control (corresponding to the proportion of patients with either an objective 
response or evidence of disease stabilisation) was reported for 77.4% and 84.4% of patients in 
Stratum 1 and 2, respectively (Table 23).  
Table 23: 
Summary of best overall response as per independent central review (FAS) – 
Study C2239 
Median PFS for patients in Stratum 1 was 9.69 months; this was associated with an estimated 2-month 
PFS rate of 41.7%. Corresponding data for Stratum 2 were 16.7 months and 57.0%, respectively. 
Median OS was 24.9 months for Stratum 1 and has yet to be reached for Stratum 2. The estimated 24-
month OS rates were 51.1% for Stratum 1 and 54.7% for Stratum 2. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study C2324 was designed to investigate treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumours 
with everolimus in patients with well-moderately differenciated tumours.  The overall design, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and choice of endpoints were considered adequate. The study met the 
primary endpoint of PFS per local investigator assessment (INV) with a median PFS of 11.4 months 
(95%CI:8.41-13.86) with everolimus compared with 4.60 months (95%CI:3.06-5.39) for placebo and 
a HR 0.35 (95%CI 0.27-0.45; p-value <0.001). This was supported by the independent review 
committee (IRC) analysis of median PFS of 13.67 months with everolimus compared with 5.68 months 
with placebo (HR 0.38; 95%CI: 0.28-0.51; p<0.001) and independent adjudicated committee (IAC) 
analyses of median PFS of 11.40 months for everolimus compared with 5.39 months for placebo (HR: 
0.34; 95%CI: 0.26-0.44; p<0.001). The ORR was low with everolimus compared with placebo and no 
difference in overall survival was observed as of the latest cut-off date of 23 February 2011.  The 
subgroup analyses supported the data from the primary endpoint, where PFS in different subgroups 
was in favour of everolimus treatment. Exploratory investigation of biomarker levels considered as 
prognostic factors (CgA, NSE, Ki67) in pNET did not reveal any relevant differences or to be predictive 
of response.   
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 28/54
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP expressed a concern for study C2324 over the rationale for the amendment to switch the 
primary endpoint of PFS from IRC to INV. The CHMP noted that the results for the analysis by INV and 
the IRC were consistent with the primary analysis and the Kaplan-Meier plots for PFS for all three 
analyses diverged early, the curves appearing more or less parallel. Furthermore, the HRs for IRC, IAC 
and INV were all similar. Thus, the CHMP considered that although changing the analysis of the 
primary endpoint should have been avoided, the effect on PFS was nevertheless reliable and clinically 
relevant. 
Carcinoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours were investigated in separate randomised placebo-
controlled trials.  The treatment of carcinoid tumours with everolimus was investigated in the 
prospective study C2325. The study did not show any improvement in PFS (as the increase in PFS was 
not statistically significant), OS or ORR. There were serious concerns over the discordant results 
between the INV, IRC, IAC for PFS and the relative decrease in OS in the everolimus treatment arm 
(difference in median OS of 6.93 months in favour of placebo [HR 1.22; 95% CI: 0.91-1.62; 
p=0.908]). It is likely that the crossover design of the study has impacted the overall survival results. 
Imbalances in baseline prognostic factors and subsequent somatostatin analogue therapy after disease 
progression in favour of the placebo group may have confounded the OS data. Thus, the CHMP was of 
the opinion that a positive benefit-risk in the carcinoid indication could not be established. A warning in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC has been included with regards to the safety and efficacy in carcinoid tumours. 
1.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considered that the results of study C2324, were robust and clinically relevant in the patient 
population of advanced neuroendocrine tumours.  
In the CHMP’s view, the efficacy results of study C2325, in a pNET patient population with carcinoid 
tumours, treated with everolimus in combination with octreotide, did not show a convincing effect on 
PFS, since analysis by IAC (16.43 months versus 11.33 months in everolimus and placebo treatment, 
respectively, p=0.026) did not reach statistical significance. In addition, the secondary efficacy 
endpoints (OS, ORR) did not show differences between the treatment arms and thus, were not 
considered supportive.  Therefore, the results of study C2325 were judged insufficient to support the 
indication of everolimus treatment in carcinoid cancers.  
1.3.5.  Clinical Safety 
The safety evaluation was based upon data from 850 patients from studies C2239, C2324 and C2325 
who were exposed to everolimus at the recommended 10-mg dose, and using the proposed daily 
treatment regimen (Table 24).  Studies C2324 (cut-off date 28 February 2010) and C2325 (cut-off 
date 02 April 2010) form the basis for safety analyses as these trials were specifically conducted in the 
indication being applied. Beyond both pivotal phase-III trials, the pooled safety dataset included 
patients crossed-over to everolimus open-label phase after placebo treatment, as well as patients from 
supportive study C2239 (cut-off date 01 November 2008).

Patient exposure 
In study C2324, treatment duration was 37.8 weeks for patients receiving everolimus compared with 
16.1 weeks for those receiving placebo. In contrast, no difference was evident in treatment duration in 
Study C2325. From the 271 patients included in the open-label phase, median duration of exposure to 
everolimus was 28.9 weeks and 26.3 weeks for Studies C2324 and C2325, respectively and 37.8 
weeks and 37.0 weeks during the blinded treatment phases. Exposure times of study C2239 were 
approximately 36 weeks in stratum 1 and 44 weeks in stratum 2. 
From the pooled dataset, 312 patients (36.7%) were exposed to everolimus therapy for a period of 
≥ 48 weeks with an overall exposure of 693.7 patient-years.  
Median dose intensities were 9.8 mg/day and 9.5 mg/day for the everolimus treatment groups in 
Studies C2324 and C2325, respectively. Exposure and dose intensities were consistent between the 
Study C2324 and Study C2325 data and the pooled dataset. Exposure information is summarised in

Dose interruptions and dose reductions were more frequent among patients receiving everolimus 
therapy than for the placebo group. These dose adjustments were primarily attributable to AEs 
(interruptions: C2324: 52.0% and C2325: 55.3%; reductions: C2324: 27.0% and C2325: 37.7%). 
Adverse events  
Overall, 99.0% of everolimus-treated patients and 97.5% of the placebo group in Study C2324 and  
100.0% of everolimus-treated patients and 96.2% of the placebo group in Study C2325 experienced 
AEs.    
All-causality AEs 
System organ classes where there was a higher proportion of everolimus-treated patients reporting 
events (≥ 10% difference relative to placebo) in either study included:  
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
 
 
  metabolism and nutrition disorders 
blood and lymphatic system disorders 
 
infections and infestations 
 
  nervous system disorders 
 
 
 
 
 
general disorders and administration site conditions 
investigations 
gastrointestinal disorders 
renal and urinary disorders 
injury, poisoning and procedural complications. 
Stomatitis, diarrhoea, rash, and fatigue were the most common AEs reported with everolimus therapy 
(for the pooled dataset) irrespective of relationship (Table 26).  Results for the pooled dataset tended 
to be consistent with those of the studies C2324 and C2325 and are consistent with the known safety 
profile of everolimus derived from earlier studies in an oncology setting.

The most common grade 3 or 4 events in the everolimus treatment groups were hyperglycemia 
(7.6%), diarrhea (7.4%), abdominal pain (6.9%), anemia (6.8%), and fatigue (6.8%). In comparing 
the incidence of grade 3 and 4 AEs between everolimus- and placebo-treated patients, events where 
the respective incidences differed most between the two treatment groups were anemia (Study C2324: 
+6.3%; Study C2325: +3.7%), stomatitis (+4.9% and +3.7%), hyperglycemia (+4.4% and +6.5%), 
hypophosphatemia (+4.4% and +2.8%), thrombocytopenia (+3.9% and +4.2%), diarrhea (+2.9% 
and +5.9%), dyspnea (+2.0% and +5.6%), hypokalemia (+1.5% and +10.7%), and fatigue (+0.4% 
and +7.9%).  
Treatment-related adverse events 
The most common adverse events suspected as being drug-related by the investigator where incidence 
> 20% difference relative to placebo were stomatitis and rash in both studies, and diarrhea in study 
C2324. ADRs occurring with an incidence ≥ 10% (in the pooled dataset) were stomatitis, rash, 
diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, anemia, weight decreased, peripheral 
edema, headache, aphthous stomatitis, hyperglycemia, asthenia, vomiting, pruritus, 
thrombocytopenia, and epistaxis.

The most common grade 3-4 adverse drug reactions, with an incidence ≥ 2%, were hyperglycemia, 
stomatitis, diarrhea, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, hypophosphatemia, and 
asthenia. These events were managable with concomittant medications, non-drug therapies, or dietary 
interventions.

Clinically notable AEs  
As a result of signals observed during the conduct of the development program, several AEs requiring 
close follow-up were identified (Table 28).  
Table 28: 
Clinically notable adverse events irrespective of relationship to treatment 
All categories were reported in a higher proportion in everolimus-treated patients, with the exception 
of hepatic events which were reported with similar rates. Flushing was found to be uncommon adverse 
reaction in the safety population with a rate of 3% and 17.4% in everolimus compared to 6.6% and 
14.9% in the placebo for studies C2324 and C2325, respectively. 
  Non-infectious pneumonitis 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 34/54
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pulmonary events (including pneumonitis and similar events) were diagnosed in 38 and 25 everolimus-
treated patients (18.6% and 11.6%) in Studies C2324 and C2325, respectively, and in only 2 patients 
(0.9%) from the placebo arm of Study C2325. During the course of the study, new or worsening CT/X-
ray changes were observed in 30.4% and 11.3% of everolimus- and placebo-treated patients in Study 
C2324 and in 40.9% and 12.8% in Study C2325, respectively. There was no evidence of progression 
from grade 2 to grade 3. 
Maximum grading (severity) of pulmonary events (pneumonitis and similar) was as follows for the 
everolimus-treatment groups of the two phase-III pivotal studies: 
• grade 1 – 22 patients (5.3%) 
• grade 2 – 28 patients (6.7%) 
• grade 3 – 12 patients (2.9%) 
• grade 4 – 1 patient (0.2%) 
Steroid therapy was initiated in 9 of 28 patients with a grade 2 pulmonary event, 11 of 12 with a 
grade 3 event, and for the single patient with a grade 4 event.  Dose adjustments were implemented 
for 18 patients with grade 2 and 7 patients with a grade 3 event.  Resolution was evident for 17 of the 
28 patients with grade 2 pulmonary events and for 7 of 12 patients with grade 3 events.  Treatment 
with everolimus was discontinued for 11 patients with a grade 2 pulmonary event and for 3 patients 
with a grade 3 event. 
A summary of pulmonary events is presented in Table 29. 
Table 29: 
Summary of pulmonary events – Studies C2324 and C2325 
 
Infections 
Infections were diagnosed in 114 and 139 patients (55.9% and 64.7%) in the everolimus treatment 
groups of Studies C2324 and C2325 and in 69 and 95 patients (34.0% and 45.0%) from the 
corresponding placebo arms.   
Seven patients from the everolimus treatment arms of Studies C2324 and C2325 reported a total of 
9 grade 4 infections (two cases of pneumonia plus single cases of bacterial infection, Enterococcal 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 35/54
 
 
 
 
 
bacteremia, Escherichia sepsis, herpes zoster, infection, septic shock, and Staphylococcal sepsis).  
Grade 3 infections occurred in 38 patients receiving everolimus; those occurring in > 1 patient were 
pneumonia (n=7), cellulitis (n=5), urinary tract infection (n=4), bacteremia (n=2), gastroenteritis 
(n=2), and lung infection (n=2).  In comparison, 16 placebo-treated patients were diagnosed with 
grade 3 infections. 
Atypical infections including aspergillosis (grade 1 [n=1]) and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (grade 2 
[n=1]; grade 3 [n=2]), pulmonary tuberculosis (grade 2 [n=1]; grade 3 [n=1]), mycobacterium avium 
complex (grade 1 [n=1]), and reactivation of hepatitis B (n=1; reported 2 months following 
discontinuation of study drug) were also observed in association with everolimus therapy. 
Of the 253 patients receiving everolimus therapy in Studies C2324 and C2325 who were diagnosed 
with an infection, dose interruption or adjustment was implemented for 46 (11.0%); this was evident 
most commonly for patients with pneumonia (n=7). 
  Stomatitis/oral mucositis 
Results from the pooled safety dataset indicate that these events typically subside without dose 
modification, and 6 patients (0.7%) discontinued therapy as a result of stomatitis with a further 
2 (0.2%) discontinuing due to mouth ulcers. Most cases were suspected by the investigator to be 
treatment-related. Grade 3-4 mucositis-related events were relatively uncommon although they were 
reported more frequently in the everolimus arm (Table 30). 
Table 30: 
Grading (severity) of stomatitis/oral mucositis/ulcer events irrespective of 
relationship to treatment 
  Renal events 
Increases in proteinuria and serum creatinine concentrations occurred more often in patients receiving 
everolimus than in those administered placebo in both pivotal studies, although renal failure and acute 
or chronic renal failure were only reported in small numbers (in both treatment groups). Most cases of 
elevated creatinine concentrations were of low grade; only 4 patients (1.0%) from the everolimus 
treatment groups in Studies C2324 and C2325 experienced a grade 3 event. 
  Bleeding/thromboembolic AEs 
The incidence of bleeding/thromboembolic AEs was greater for patients who received everolimus 
(Study C2324: 11.3%; Study C2325: 22.8%) relative to those administered placebo (Study C2324: 
9.9%; Study C2325: 17.5%). When excluding haemorrhoids, the most common PT within this 
grouping, the incidence of all other hemorrhagic events was similar between the treatment groups in 
the two pivotal phase-III studies.  
Minor bleeding in terms of epistaxis was reported by 21.1% and 15.3% of patients from the everolimus 
treatment group in Study C2324 and C2325 (versus 1.5% and 1.9% with placebo). Seventy-two of the 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 36/54
 
 
 
 
 
76 patients with epistaxis had a grade 1 (mild) event; the remaining 4 patients experienced a grade 2 
event. No grade 3 or 4 events were reported. 
A summary of key haematopoiesis and cytopenia events is shown in Table 31.

Summary of key haematopoiesis decreased/cytopenia events 
 
Pulmonary embolism 
Pulmonary embolism occurred more frequently in the everolimus arms (about 2.5% vs. 0.5%) and was 
the cause of death for 2 everolimus-treated patients (0.2%) across the broad NET program and for 1 
patient (0.5%) from the comparator arms.

  Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events were reported more frequently for patients receiving everolimus than for the 
placebo groups (Table 34). The most frequently reported SAEs in patients receiving everolimus therapy 
(for the pooled dataset) were abdominal pain (5.2%), pyrexia (3.6%), and pneumonia (3.1%). Events 
within the following system organ classes were more frequent among patients receiving everolimus 
therapy relative to placebo: respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (Study C2324: +9.3%; 
Study C2325: +7.8%), infections and infestations (+6.4% and +6.9%), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (+4.4% and +4.6%), gastrointestinal disorders (+3.3% and +5.3%), 
and metabolism and nutrition disorders (+3.0% and +7.0%). 
Overall, a total of 85 everolimus-treated patients (20.3%) compared with only 18 placebo-treated 
patients (4.3%) in the two pivotal phase-III studies reported at least 1 SAE that was suspected to be 
related to study drug during treatment or within the 28-day period of the end of treatment. Within the 
pooled dataset 155 (18.2%) of everolimus patients reported at least 1 related SAE. The most 
commonly reported treatment-related SAEs were pneumonitis (everolimus: 8 patients [1.9%]; 
placebo: 0 patients), diarrhea (6 [1.4%] ; 2 patients [0.5%]), anemia (6 [1.4%] ; 0 patients), and 
interstitial lung disease (5 [1.2%] ; 0 patients).

  Deaths 
Of the 839 patients participating in Studies C2324 and C2325, there were 151 (35.7%) and 
135 (32.5%) deaths from the everolimus and placebo treatment groups, respectively. 
‘On-treatment’ deaths were recorded for 45 patients (5.4%) by the 28 February 2010 and 02 April 
2010 data cut-off dates for Studies C2324 and C2325, respectively. Of the 45 patients who died, 30 
(7.2%) had received treatment with everolimus and 15 (3.6%) treatment with placebo. 
20 of the 45 on-treatment deaths (44.4%) reported in Studies C2324 and C2325 were attributed to 
the underlying malignancy.  The remaining 25 cases were mostly attributed to solitary events. Table 
35 summarises the nature of AEs as primary cause of death and Table 36 describes the time to on-
treatment death in cases where AEs were the primary cause.  
One death from acute respiratory distress syndrome, in a patient receiving everolimus therapy, was 
suspected to be causally related to treatment. A second patient with a cause of death of ‘other 
unknown’, was diagnosed with pneumonia and interstitial pneumonitis 3 weeks earlier. The 
investigator had attributed death in this case to clinical disease progression. There was one death due 
to reactivation of hepatitis B with acute liver failure. 
Nine on-treatment deaths (3.3%) were reported during the open-label phases of Studies C2324 and 
C2325 that were not attributed to the underlying malignancy.

Table 36: 
Time to on-treatment death for cases where adverse events were the primary 
cause – Studies C2324 and C2325 
In study C2239 there were ten deaths (8.7%) reported on-treatment for stratum 1. Six of these ten 
deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to the primary disease and/or to disease 
progression. All 4 AE-related deaths belonged to the respiratory and infections’ SOCs. In stratum 2, 
two on- treatment deaths (4.4%) were reported. Both were considered by the investigator to be 
related to the primary disease and/or disease progression. 
Laboratory findings 
Grade 3 and 4 hematology changes were observed in 28.0% and 29.3% of everolimus-treated patients 
and 7.4% and 9.9% of placebo-treated patients in Studies C2324 and C2325, respectively. Low 
hemoglobin occurred in 64.2% and 27.1% of patients receiving everolimus and placebo, respectively, 
in Study C2324 and in 74.0% and 32.7% of patients in Study C2325. Anemia was reported as an AE in 
22.1% and 8.9% of patients receiving everolimus and placebo, respectively, in Study C2324 and in 
27.9% and 10.4% of patients in Study C2325. Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and 
neutropenia were also all reported more frequently for patients receiving everolimus (both overall and 
as grade 3-4 events) relative to the placebo arm. 
Nearly all patients reported treatment-emergent changes in clinical chemistry laboratory results. Grade 
3 and 4 changes were observed in 37.7% of patients receiving everolimus and 18.8% of the placebo 
treatment group in Study C2324 and in 37.2% of everolimus- and 17.0% placebo-treated patients in 
Study C2325. The proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 changes for hyperglycemia, 
hypophosphatemia, and hypokalemia were higher with everolimus than with placebo therapy. Although 
increases in cholesterol, AST(aspartate aminotransferase) ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and triglyceride 
concentrations were reported more often for everolimus, the incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxicity did not 
differ. 
One of the more frequently documented laboratory abnormalities in the pivotal phase-III studies was 
hypophosphatemia, although clinical sequelae were not routinely evident. Hypophosphatemia was 
reported as an SAE in 2 patients and it led to the discontinuation of treatment for a single patient. No 
patients presented with identifiable manifestations of severe phosphate deficiency, such as 
rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, respiratory insufficiency, erythrocyte dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, 
or skeletal demineralization that were suspected to be drug related. The etiology of hypophosphatemia 
associated with everolimus is unknown. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 43/54
 
 
 
 
 
Laboratory findings associated with abnormal hepatic function were evident for both treatment groups. 
Low grade elevations of transaminase concentrations were more common in the everolimus treatment 
group. 
No untoward ECG changes were recorded during the two pivotal studies.  
No significant changes in pulse, respiratory rate, or temperature were noted.

The median age of patients included in the pivotal phase-III trials was 58 and 60 years (Studies C2324 
and C2325), respectively.  The incidence of AEs was generally similar for patients < 65 years of age 
and those aged ≥ 65 years. Adverse events reported with ≥ 1.5-fold the incidence in >65 years old 
patients receiving everolimus (and were reported by ≥ 10% of patients in either treatment group) 
included dehydration. In contrast, upper abdominal pain, headache, hypertension, and oropharyngeal 
pain were reported less frequently among the older patient population.  
Within the pooled dataset, the incidence of most AEs was generally similar for both Caucasians and 
Asians.The incidence of most AEs was generally similar for both men and women. 
Specific studies in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment were not conducted in this 
application. As everolimus is eliminated primarily via the hepatic route, a special warning is already 
included in the SmPC as exposure might be increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Mild 
elevations of serum creatinine concentration have been observed.  
The safety of everolimus in paediatric patients has not been studied in these populations.   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Based on an in vitro inhibition assay, octreotide is not expected to inhibit the metabolic clearance of 
co-medications metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, 
CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. 
In study C2325, coadministration of octreotide was found to have a 1.5-fold increase in octreotide 
C min. In study C2239 the increase of octreotide Cmin was only measured with 1.2-fold. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The time to withdrawal as a consequence to adverse events was investigated. There were 16 
withdrawal events and 62 censored events in the everolimus plus octreotide treatment arm. There 
were 11 withdrawal events and 138 censored events in the placebo arm. The impact of octreotide on 
the time to withdrawal was not statistically significant (HR=1.2 for a 1.5 fold increase in octreotide 
C min; 95%CI 0.77-1.86). The hazard ratios on time to withdrawal for a 1.5-fold increase (4 ng/mL to 6 
ng/mL) in octreotide Cmin at everolimus Cmin of 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/mL and a 2-fold increase (5 ng/mL to 
10 ng/mL) in everolimus Cmin at octreotide Cmin of 4 and 6 ng/mL are presented in Table 37.

Dose adjustments were primarily attributable to AEs (interruptions: C2324: 52.0% and C2325: 55.3%; 
reductions: C2324: 27.0% and C2325: 37.7%). In the pooled dataset, 63.8% of patients required 
dose reductions or interruptions. The most commonly reported AEs leading to everolimus dose 
adjustment (for the pooled dataset) were stomatitis (9.5%), diarrhea (6.7%), thrombocytopenia 
(6.7%), pyrexia (4.8%), pneumonitis (4.1%), abdominal pain (3.8%), and fatigue (3.5%). 
The most commonly reported AEs leading to discontinuation of everolimus therapy for the pooled 
dataset were pneumonitis (1.4%), fatigue (1.4%), asthenia (1.1%), diarrhea (0.9%), pneumonia 
(0.9%), interstitial lung disease (0.8%), and pyrexia (0.8%). Discontinuations as the result of AEs 
from the following system organ classes were also more common with everolimus (relative to 
placebo): respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (Study C2324: +5.9%; Study C2325: 
+5.5%), general disorders and administration site conditions (+2.4% and +5.1%), and 
gastrointestinal disorders (+1.0% and +4.6%). 
Treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 12.9% of patients in the pooled 
dataset, and differences to the placebo rate were of +11.2% in study C2324 and +15.3% in study 
C2325. The most commonly reported treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation of everolimus in 
the two pivotal studies were pneumonitis (2.1%), interstitial lung disease (1.4%), fatigue (1.2%), and 
diarrhea (1.0%).  
Post marketing experience 
Everolimus (Afinitor) is commercially available for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma.  A total patient exposure in excess of 1600 patient-years has been calculated based on 
commercial usage only from the amount of active substance sold or distributed between March 2009 
and March 2010.  Overall, 5,899 oncology patients have received treatment with everolimus in 
Novartis-sponsored studies. 
Everolimus is also commercially available as Certican within the EU and other global markets for the 
prophylaxis of allograft rejection following renal or cardiac transplantation, in a combination 
immunosuppressive regimen with cyclosporine and corticosteroid therapy.  A total patient exposure in 
excess of 51,000 patient-years has been calculated from the amount of active substance sold or 
distributed between June 2003 and the present time. 
1.3.6.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The analysis and presentation of the safety of everolimus was based on comparison with placebo in the 
phase III studies C2324 and study 2325 in patients with advanced NET and study C2239.  
Regarding all-causality AEs, there was an increase in AEs in patients treated with everolimus and from 
most organ systems though the adverse events recorded were in line with the previous experience. 
The incidence of grade 3 and 4 AEs was approximately 70% in the pooled dataset. This was 2-3-fold 
higher than in the previous study C2240 (RCC pivotal study) though there was 2-3-fold higher 
exposure time in the pooled dataset. The overall increase in grade 4 events was about 5-10% and for 
grade 3, about 15%. Compared with placebo, everolimus was associated with a clear increase in grade 
3-4 AEs (+20-30%). The high incidences of overall AEs in the placebo arm of study C2324 (97.5%) as 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 45/54
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
well as the high rate of grade 3 (31.5%) and grade 4 (7.4%) AEs were likely to be associated to the 
underlying disease and co-morbidities of the study population. Both in the everolimus and in the 
placebo arms of study C2325, the grade 3 and 4 AE rates were >10% higher than in study C2324. 
Study C2239 revealed comparable differences between strata of 82.2% vs. 74.8% with or without 
additional octreotide treatment. The increased incidence of grade 3-4 diarrhea and hypokalaemia in 
study C2325 was assumed to be related to the underlying disease of carcinoid syndrome. Side effects 
from interactions with the additional octreotide treatment should also be taken into account, as could 
be observed in study C2239 in stratum 2 (+octreotide) where incidence of hypokalaemia was twice 
that of stratum 1.  
The rate of suspected grade 3 and 4 AEs was approximately 43% with no visible differences between 
both phase III studies or between study C2239 treatment strata. In view that everolimus was 
investigated in pre-treated patients the data of grade 3 and 4 suspected adverse events were 
supportive that everolimus was well tolerated in these patients.  
Clinically relevant AEs and event rates were as expected. They occurred 1.5 - 2 times more often in 
the everolimus than in the placebo arms, except for bleeding/thomboembolic and hepatic events which 
occurred similarly, and pulmonary events which were reported less than <1% in the placebo groups. In 
general, their profile was comparable to previous studies. 
Pulmonary events were diagnosed in incidences similar to previous studies and were thoroughly 
addressed by baseline and on-study chest CT-scans/X-rays. The safety issue of pneumonitis is well 
addressed in the SmPC. 
The number of events for the most commonly reported treatment related SAEs were 11 for 
pneumonia, diarrhea and anaemia (placebo: 0; 2; 0) and 7 events for interstitial lung disease. 
The rate of SAEs in the pooled dataset was higher than in the previous pivotal study (C2240) but of 
similar nature, however abdominal pain was reported more and most frequently (5.2%). The difference 
in treatment duration as well as active treatment may have contributed to the higher rates of SAEs in 
the everolimus treatment arms. Similarly, the enhanced SAE rates in study C2325 may also be due to 
the add-on therapy of octreotide.  
45 on-treatment deaths were reported in both phase III studies. The number of on-treatment deaths 
in both studies was significantly different between everolimus and placebo with 30 vs. 15 deaths, 
respectively. In study C2324 the number of deaths due to adverse events was 7 for everolimus and 1 
for placebo. In study C2325 the total number of deaths was higher than in study C2324 with 12 and 5 
events in everolimus and placebo arms, respectively. For 15 cases of death due to AE a possible 
relatedness could not be ruled out. A higher incidence of deaths might be expected with active 
treatment and in an “add-on” treatment setting, especially in an elderly population with advanced NET. 
However, the adverse events which were suspected to be the cause of death often belonged to the 
categories of identified clinically notable events/SOCs seen with everolimus (e.g. infections, 
pneumonia).  
Everolimus is associated with a 3-4-fold increase in AEs leading to discontinuation (approx. 22 %). The 
incidence of grade 3 and 4 suspected AEs leading to discontinuation in the carcinoid study (10.3 %) 
was almost twice that in the pancreatic NET study (5.4 %). 
The abnormal laboratory values were comparable to the known safety profile of everolimus and can be 
described as class-effects of m-TOR inhibitors. However, the frequencies reported were higher than 
previously recorded, which may be attributed to increased exposure in the clinical trials.  
Based on blood sampling in studies C2239 and C2325, co-administration of octreotide was found to 
have a 1.5-fold increase in octreotide Cmin in study C2325 and this increased exposure may have 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/723893/2011  
Page 46/54
 
 
 
 
contributed to the enhanced rate of adverse events in both the treatment arms. Though the increase of 
octreotide Cmin was only measured with 1.2-fold in study C2239, an enhanced AE rate in stratum 2 was 
also detected. Analysis of time to withdrawal in study C2325 due to AEs showed no influence of the 
concentrations of octreotide and everolimus on the time to withdrawal.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
1.3.7.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of 10 mg everolimus in patients with advanced NET was adequately described. 
Clinically relevant AEs occurred 1.5-2 times more often than in previous studies. Pneumonitis is a well 
known adverse reaction to everolimus and grade 3 events were reported in 3% of the patients (vs. 
<1% on placebo). Grade 3 infectious events were also more frequently reported in the everolimus 
arm. Both these events and stomatitis/oral mucositis represent the most important clinical issues, and 
each of these events can be managed effectively in the clinical setting and are adequately reflected in 
the SmPC.  Overall, the majority of patients were either able to continue treatment with everolimus, or 
discontinued treatment and subsequently experienced complete resolution or improvement in their 
symptoms. 
No additional safety concerns were raised for subpopulations of men or women, the elderly, or racial 
groups.  The evaluation of the safety data does not indicate the need for any additional safety 
monitoring. 
In conclusion, safety results and adverse drug reactions from the phase III studies C2324 and C2325 
were largely consistent with observations in previous everolimus studies in an oncology setting, though 
higher frequencies were reported. In general, adverse events were low-grade, manageable, reversible 
and non-cumulative.  
1.4.  Risk Management Plan  
In this application, the MAH submitted an updated RMP. The RMP has been updated to reflect the 
proposed indication in advanced neuroendocrine tumours (NET) of pancreatic origin as well as safety-
related changes from Core Data Sheet (CDS) version 1.5.  The final updated RMP for this new 
indication, version 5.0, dated 18th of May 2011, is considered acceptable.

1.5.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. The reason was that there were no significant changes made 
to the Package Leaflet. This has been found acceptable by the CHMP.  
2.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The primary objective of the pivotal study C2324 was increase in PFS in everolimus-treated patients 
compared to placebo plus BSC-treated patients. Based on study C2324, there was a median PFS of 
11.04 vs 4.60 months per INV for everolimus and placebo, respectively (HR 0.35, 95%CI 0.27-0.45; 
p<0.001). These results were consistent with the PFS results from the IAC and IRC.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No advantage in OS or time to deterioration of the WHO performance were observed. Because of the 
cross-over design of the pivotal study, analysis of the secondary endpoints overall survival and WHO 
performance status was impaired. It is uncertain whether the improvement in PFS would translate into 
a long term beneficial effect in terms of OS. However, the effect observed in terms of PFS was 
considered clinically relevant and convincing even in the absence of an effect in terms of OS.  
Concerning study C2325 which included patients with carcinoid tumours, the CHMP found this study 
problematic as PFS only reached statistical significance in a supportive analysis (INV) and not in the 
primary analysis (IAC) and more deaths (100 vs. 85 total) were reported from the everolimus 
treatment group (HR 1.22; 95%CI: 0.91-1.62; p=0.908). Therefore, the CHMP did not support the 
extension of the indication in advanced pancreatic NET in carcinoid tumours.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common ADRs, with an incidence ≥ 10% in the pooled dataset, were stomatitis, rash, 
diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, anemia, weight decreased, peripheral 
edema, headache, aphthous stomatitis, hyperglycemia, asthenia, vomiting, pruritus, 
thrombocytopenia, and epistaxis. 
The most common grade 3-4 ADRs, with an incidence of ≥ 2%, were hyperglycemia, stomatitis, 
diarrhea, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, hypophosphatemia, and asthenia. 
The most frequently reported SAEs were abdominal pain, pyrexia and pneumonia. 
The safety of everolimus was largely consistent with observations from previous everolimus studies in 
an oncology setting, though the CHMP noted that ADRs occured in higher frequencies which was likely 
attributed to the 2-fold increase in patient exposure to everolimus compared to that of the placebo 
group. Adverse events were predictable, largely low-grade, manageable, reversible and non-
cumulative.  
The number of on-treatment deaths for study C2324 was higher with everolimus treatment: 7 patients 
(3.4 %) and 1 (0.5 %) with everolimus vs. placebo, respectively. Seven deaths were reported as 
related to AEs, of these one death was considered as related, and for 6 cases a possible relation could 
not be ruled out.  
During the open-label phases of studies C2324 and C2325, 9 deaths with suspected causality to AEs 
occurred with a similar AE profile. In study C2239 4 AE-related deaths occurred which were of the 
respiratory or infections’ SOC.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The concomitant administration of somatostatin analogues (e.g. octreotide) increased the frequency of 
reported ADRs in patients with carcinoid tumours. It was unclear to what extent add-on to octreotide 
contributed to the poor tolerability. However, the analysis of the concentrations of octreotide and 
everolimus showed no effect on the withdrawal of carcinoid patients due to AEs suggesting a lack of 
influence of octreotide on the withdrawal of patients due to AEs. Data from the pNET study where 
octreotide co-medication was an option at the discretion of the investigator showed no increase in 
toxicity when both treatments were combined. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
PFS was considered an important and appropriate primary endpoint for the study C2324 in pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours. The HR and increase in median PFS were statistically significant. The cross-
over design confounded the data for overall survival, thus the effect on overall survival could not be 
ascertained. However, the treatment effect in terms of PFS was considered clinically relevant and 
convincing even in the absence of an effect in terms of OS for this patient population,  as few approved 
pharmacological treatment options are available. 
Long term data on the patient population were not available. The safety of everolimus was largely 
consistent with observations from previous everolimus studies. The identified ADRs were mostly well 
tolerated and graded as mild and manageable.

Benefit-risk balance 
Although the increase in PFS in study C2324 was not supported with additional endpoints, the effect 
still remained clinically relevant. The adverse events reported were considered acceptable for a patient 
population of adult patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin.  Thus, it was 
considered that the clinical benefit observed with the improvement of PFS outweighed the risks 
previously identified in the safety population. 
Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product and no 
additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.  
3.  Conclusion 
On 21 July 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet (Attachment 1 - changes highlighted) 
4.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope: 
Extension of indication 
Extension of indication to include ‘Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, 
well- or moderately-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic origin in adults with 
progressive disease’. 
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics and the 
Package Leaflet have been updated. The Risk Management Plan statement in Annex II has been 
updated to the new template.  The MAH also took the opportunity to update the product information in 
line with the QRD template (version 7.3.1) and to make minor corrections.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare, serious and life-threatening AI blistering disease affecting the mucosa and 
skin, and there is a high unmet medical need for safer and more effective treatment options.  A 
comprehensive literature review of approximately 300 publications in PV conducted by the Applicant 
identified many small, uncontrolled studies and case reports in 788 patients that support the safe and 
effective use of rituximab in patients with severe or refractory PV.  
Assessment report

Page 6/71 
 
  
  
 
 
Due to the rarity of pemphigus, few prospective clinical trials are available and these are limited by the low 
numbers of patients studied and treatment arms that do not demonstrate statistically significant differences.  
Corticosteroids and, in some European countries, azathioprine are the only EU-approved treatments for 
patients with PV.  Systemic corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for pemphigus patients 
since the 1950s based on limited and uncontrolled clinical data.  Similarly, the use of adjuvant 
immunosuppressant therapy, such as azathioprine, which has been approved alone and in combination with 
systemic corticosteroids, for the treatment of PV in the European Union for over 15 years, has been 
established in treatment guidelines in Europe despite the scarcity of well-designed randomized controlled 
studies, and evidence that adjuvant therapies have only a minimal steroid-sparing effect.  
Based on the literature, chronic and/or high dose corticosteroid therapy alone results in an estimated 
remission rate of <30%.  Remission may be short lived. Serious and sometimes fatal AEs, resulting from 
immunosuppression due to long-term use of steroids, may occur.  Despite widespread use, there is no 
consensus on whether unapproved steroid-sparing agents are beneficial due to the scarcity of well-designed 
randomized controlled studies.  PV remains a serious life-threatening disease and given the unsatisfactory 
safety and efficacy profile of the existing approved therapies (corticosteroids and azathioprine), a major 
unmet medical need exists for safer and more effective novel, targeted mechanism-based treatment options 
for moderately to severely active PV. 
Owing to its ability to deplete pathogenic B cells and reduce autoantibodies, rituximab has been successfully 
used for AI indications of RA and GPA/MPA.  Pemphigus patients develop autoantibodies to desmosomal 
cadherins. The mechanism that initiates the formation of these autoantibodies is presumed to involve loss of 
B cell tolerance to these self-antigens.  In PF, these autoantibodies target Dsg1; in PV, these autoantibodies 
target Dsg1 and Dsg3.  Circulating B cells produce these autoantibodies which bind to keratinocytes, inhibit 
cell-cell adhesion, and cause blister formation and inflammation in the skin and mucous membrane.  Beyond 
the reduction of autoantibodies contributing to disease, dysregulated B cells may further worsen the disease 
by secreting cytokines, co-stimulating T cells, and differentiating into memory B cells which contribute to 
persistent autoantibody production and relapsing disease. 
In the last decade, there have been approximately 300 reports of rituximab use in 788 PV patients published 
as case reports and small uncontrolled clinical studies, especially in severe, recalcitrant disease.  These 
publications report on the successful use of rituximab in severe and refractory pemphigus due to its 
B cell-depleting effect.  Similar to RA and GPA/MPA, in PV patients treated with rituximab, it has been 
observed that profound peripheral B cell depletion occurs by 3 weeks and B cell reconstitution begins at 
approximately 6 months after rituximab treatment.  In addition, a dramatic decrease in anti-Dsg1 and 
anti-Dsg3 IgG antibodies was observed after rituximab treatment in 8 of 12 patients who achieved CR and 
CR in these patients was associated with blockage of B cell maturation, repopulation with naïve B cells and 
transitional B cells, delayed reappearance of memory B cells, and disappearance of desmoglein-specific 
IgG +  B cells. 
The Sponsor of Study ML22196 is Rouen University Hospital, France (Charles Nicolle Hospital-CHU-Hôpitaux 
de Rouen).  The Applicant provided the rituximab study drug and funding for the 12 month post-treatment 
follow-up period, but had no role in study design, study conduct, data collection, or publication of the results.  
Study database and supporting documents were transferred from the Sponsor to the Applicant in 
December 2016 after the study had been completed and database lock had occurred. 
A MAH-sponsored double-blind, randomised, active-controlled Phase III Study WA29330 (PEMPHIX) is still 
ongoing.  
The Applicant therefore seeks regulatory approval for rituximab in the following indication: 
Rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The pharmacologically active substance in MabThera, Rituximab (CAS 174722–31–7), is a recombinant 
immunoglobulin-G monoclonal antibody with a molecular mass of approximately 145 kD. 
As an unaltered protein, Rituximab is predicted to be metabolised by regular proteinolysis in the patient and 
biodegraded in sewage treatment, as shown for other monoclonal antibodies. Thus, Rituximab is unlikely to 
result in a significant risk to the environment and therefore it is submitted that it does not need a formal ERA 
according to the EMA 2006 Guideline (corr. 2). This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
It is agreed that due to the nature of the product and based on the data submitted in this application 
Rituximab is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The application consists of the data from a single multi-centre randomised controlled open-label trial with a 
24-month treatment period and a 12-month follow-up period, comparing RTX and short-term ‘low’-dose 
corticosteroids with long-term standard-dose corticosteroids in patients with newly diagnosed pemphigus 
vulgaris (PV) or pemphigus foliaceus. Most patients (had pemphigus vulgaris and the analyses focus on this 
population (denoted as ITT-PV), which is in line with the requested indication for pemphigus vulgaris only. 
After completion of the clinical trial and database lock the data were transferred in December 2016 by the 
Sponsor-Investigator (Rouen University Hospital in France) to the applicant and MAH of MabThera (Roche) 
and re-analysed by a third party (Everest Clinical Research). The applicant stated that the study objectives 
and method of analysis for the primary endpoint were prospectively defined in the initial protocol and the 
sponsor’s Statistical Analysis Plan.  
The applicant had provided the study drug and funding for the 12-month follow-up period, and stated that 
they had no role in study design, study conduct, data collection, or publication of the results. 
Currently another confirmatory study sponsored by the applicant is ongoing. Study WA29330 is a 
randomized (1:1), double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, parallel-arm, multi-center, superiority 
trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of rituximab compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in achieving 
sustained clinical remission (off prednisone for at least 4 consecutive months) at week 52, in adult patients 
with moderate-to-severely active pemphigus vulgaris. The planned enrolment of 132 patients in Study 
WA29330 was completed and primary analysis results are anticipated to be available Q4 2018/Q1 2019. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Page 8/71 
 
  
  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetic or immunogenicity assessments were prospectively planned by the sponsor as part of 
the study ML22196 protocol or schedule of assessments. The applicant evaluated the frozen sera collected 
from rituximab-dosed patients and determined that it was not feasible to perform population 
pharmacokinetic analyses from the samples available from this study; most of the samples were outside the 
stability window based on available pharmacokinetic sample stability data, resulting in a very limited 
number of patient samples for which concentrations could be accurately quantified for inclusion in a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis (3.5 years). In addition, the information required for population 
pharmacokinetic analysis such as the actual date and time of blood sampling, the exact dose of rituximab 
administered (overall, in case of dosing interruption and/or relapse), and the actual date and time of drug 
administration were not collected on the patient Case Report Forms. 
Rituximab concentrations were only measured in samples used for the measurement of serum anti-drug 
antibodies (ADAs), to help in the interpretation of the ADA data. No concentration data were provided. 
Frozen serum samples were within the established stability for anti-drug antibody (ADA) analysis (7 years, 
10 months), and the applicant assessed immunogenicity in the pemphigus vulgaris patient population. 
For the analysis of rituximab concentrations in pemphigus vulgaris patient serum samples, validated ELISA 
was used. The calibration curve range was 2.5 - 160 ng/ml. The minimum dilution for neat human serum 
samples is 1/100, resulting in a minimum quantifiable concentration of 500 ng/ml. The accuracy and the 
precision were within acceptable ranges. No hook effect was observed (by using a high rituximab 
concentration level) and accuracy and linearity of dilution was determined to be acceptable. Stability of neat 
human serum samples was evaluated and within range for multiple freeze/thaw cycles, for 24 hours at room 
temperature, after long term storage at −20°C for four months and after long term storage at  −60°C or 
below for three years and six months. 
An (updated) anti-rituximab antibody assay was developed with acceptable accuracy and precision. The 
relative sensitivity of the method for the evaluated positive control (rabbit polyclonal antirituximab 
antibodies) was approximately 1.42 ng/ml serum. Above this detection threshold, the assay can tolerate an 
approximate 590-fold excess of rituximab over anti-rituximab antibodies (evaluated for the positive control 
antibody during assay validation). 
A patient was considered to have an ADA positive result when the baseline sample (i.e. prior to the first 
rituximab administration in the study) was negative or missing, and at least one sample post-baseline was 
positive and was classified as “treatment-induced”. In patients where the baseline sample was positive, the 
patient was classified as “treatment-enhanced”, when at least one post baseline sample had an increase in 
titer of ≥0.6. In cases where the baseline sample was positive, but the post baseline samples increased by 
<0.6, patients were classified as “treatment unaffected”. 
Baseline and at least one post-baseline sample were evaluable in 34 of the 38 pemphigus vulgaris patients 
in the rituximab + prednisone arm. Fourteen of the 34 patients (41%) were considered treatment-induced 
and 5 of 34 (15%) were considered treatment-enhanced. Therefore, the incidence of 
treatment-induced/enhanced in pemphigus vulgaris patients was 19 of 34 patients (55.9%). ADAs were 
generally transitory, with positive titers ranging from 1 to 4.31. 
Rituximab concentrations were reported in one publication in the pemphigus vulgaris patient population 
(Schmidt et al. 2009). The pharmacokinetics of rituximab was characterized in 11 patients (6 male and 5 
female, aged 27 - 70 years) with severe pemphigus vulgaris who were resistant to at least one previous 
therapy, not including rituximab. Rituximab was administered by infusions at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at weekly 
intervals for a total of four doses. This is the same dose as recommended for patients with 
polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis patients. Patients also received immunosuppressant therapies 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 9/71 
 
  
  
including azathioprine, corticosteroids, and mycophenolate mofetil. In serum samples collected 3 months 
after the first rituximab infusion, the mean (s.d.) rituximab concentration was 22.9 (24.6) µg/ml and ranged 
from 4.8 to 89.2 µg/ml.  
Using population pharmacokinetic analysis models previous developed for rheumatoid arthritis patients and 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis patients, the rituximab concentrations at 3 months 
after first infusion from this publication were in agreement with those predicted for rheumatoid arthritis 
patients and granulomatosis with polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis patients (see figures below). 
Figure PK 1. Comparison of simulated pharmacokinetic profiles and observed data (day 90) in pemphigus 
vulgaris patients who received 4 i.v. infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2; popPK model in rheumatoid arthritis 
patients (left figure) and polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis patients (right figure). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to B-lymphocyte antigen (CD20), a 
transmembrane protein present on B lymphocytes. The binding of rituximab to CD20 on B-lymphocytes 
promotes B cell lysis via a number of different possible mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In study ML22196, pharmacodynamics measurements, i.e. level of CD19+ B-cells as a marker for the target 
CD20+ cells, and desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and 3 antibody titres, were performed for the first 37 patients. In the 
Safety-PV sample, pharmacodynamics measurements were available for n=16 in the rituximab group and 
15 in the corticosteroid-only group.  
One month after baseline, after two 1000 mg infusions in the rituximab group, the percentage of CD19+ B 
lymphocytes (of total lymphocytes) was on average 0.2% in the rituximab group and 14% in the 
corticosteroid-only group. It appears that the percentage of CD19+ B lymphocytes increases towards month 
12, to approach baseline levels (Figure 6 below). At month 24, the percentage of CD19+ positive B 
lymphocytes was still low in the patients (n=15) from the rituximab treated group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 10/71 
 
  
  
 
The baseline titres of anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3 (Figure 8) decreased within 3 months to similar low levels in 
both groups (Figure 8). In the corticosteroid-only group, the titres of anti-Dsg3 started to increase again 
after 12 months, although they did not return to baseline level in 24 months. Anti-Dsg1 titres remained low 
over 24 months in both groups (not shown). 
The pharmacodynamics results regarding sustained B-cell depletion and regarding sustained reduction of 
anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 are considered to be supportive for the mode-of-action of rituximab in pemphigus 
vulgaris. Anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 play a key role in the pathogenesis of pemphigus vulgaris.  
There was no major difference between Rituximab arm (Rituximab + Low-Dose Prednisone) and High-Dose 
Prednisone treatment groups regarding the reduction of anti-desmoglein in the first 12 months of therapy. 
It is noted that high-Dose Prednisone treatment is known to be effective in PV. After 12 months, Rituximab 
+ Low-Dose Prednisone was superior in reducing Dsg-3 titers. Although sample size for these measurements 
was low (N=37), sample size was pre-planned and seen the clear effect it is considered unlikely that a larger 
sample would change the results. 
It is noted that mean percentages of CD19+ B cell may be a suboptimal presentation because distributions 
are expected to be skewed. Percentage of patients below detection limit over time (baseline, months 3, 6, 
12, 18 and 24) could have been an alternative. Further, the number of patients in the corticosteroid group 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 11/71 
 
  
  
 
 
is very small. As the effect of rituximab on B-cells in auto-immune diseases is well established, the issue is 
not pursued. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
No PK/PD modelling has been applied. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamics results regarding sustained B-cell depletion and regarding sustained reduction of 
anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 are considered to be supportive for the mode-of-action of rituximab in pemphigus 
vulgaris. Anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 play a key role in the pathogenesis of pemphigus vulgaris.  
No pharmacokinetic data have been obtained in the submitted studies. In literature one study was described 
in this patient group, in which pharmacokinetic data was obtained 90 days after the first rituximab infusion.  
Using the previous developed popPK models for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis patients (GPA/MPA) did not indicate that the serum concentrations at 
day 90 in pemphigus vulgaris patients were different than those predicted in RA patients and GPA/MPA 
patients. Although these results may be expected, being all three autoimmune populations, it should be 
noted that the data in pemphigus vulgaris patients is very limited. 
The majority of the patients developed ADAs (HACA), but seemed not to have a negative impact on efficacy 
(see clinical assessment).  
Both rituximab as the comparator High-Dose Prednisone induced the reduction of auto-antibodies 
anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 to similar extent in the first 12 months of treatment. After 12 months, the reduction 
of these auto-antibodies was better maintained with rituximab, than with High-Dose Prednisone.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No concerns have been identified with regard to the clinical pharmacology. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Introduction 
The basis of this application is the pivotal study, ML22196, where newly diagnosed patients with moderate 
to severe pemphigus are randomized to rituximab + low-dose corticosteroids (CS) or high-dose CS.  
The goal of treatment is rapid disease control, thus, systemic CS have played a central role in the first-line. 
CS has been backbone of therapy in patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV), and is usually very effective with 
regards to disease control. However, systemic CS comes at a cost, since side effects are common. Thus, in 
an  attempt  to  reduce  the  exposure  to  CS,  other  non-steroidal  immune-modulatory  agents,  such  as 
azathioprine  and  mycophenolate  mofetil,  have  been  used  in  combination  with  (low-dose)  CS.  However, 
despite the well-known use of CS sparring agents in the clinical setting, it is acknowledged that there has not 
been any prospective randomized clinical trial, where CS + a CS sparring agent showed positive efficacy. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Formal dose-response studies were not conducted but refer to the previous studies conducted in patients 
with RA. This is endorsed.

The  choice  of  the  initial  rituximab  dose  administered  at  2  x  1000  mg  IV,  2  weeks  apart,  was  based  on 
findings  demonstrated  in  patients  with  RA  where  this  regimen  sustained  peripheral  B-cell  depletion  for 
approximately 6 to 9 months. The same has also been reported in PV patients treated with rituximab, where 
it  was  observed  that  B  cell  reconstitution  begins  at  approximately  6  months  after  rituximab  treatment 
(Mouquet et al. 2008). 
Maintenance doses of 500 mg IV at 12 months (M12) and 18 months (M18) after the initial treatment was 
based on the Principal Investigator’s previous published study in which the rate of relapse was observed to 
be approximately 30% after two years; with patients relapsing during the second year (mean (SD) time to 
relapse: 18.9 ± 7.9 months) (Joly et al. 2007). The two additional infusions at M12 and M18 were expected 
to prevent relapses during the second year of treatment. The Principal Investigator acknowledged that the 
500 mg dose of rituximab used for maintenance had not been formally studied although it was similar to the 
maintenance dose used in ANCA associated vasculitis (Guillevin et al. 2014). Patients could receive 1000 mg 
IV  rituximab  at  the  time  of  relapse  (but  no  earlier  than  16  weeks  after  the  previous  infusion),  and  the 
scheduled maintenance rituximab dose withheld, depending on the timing of the relapse. 
2.4.2.  Main study – Study ML22196 
Title of Study: Comparison of Treatment with Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody Rituximab (Mabthera®) in 
Combination  with  Short-Term  Systemic  Corticosteroid  Therapy  Compared  to  Long-Term  Systemic 
Corticosteroid Therapy in Patients with Pemphigus 
Methods 
Study participants 
Inclusion Criteria 
1) Patients between ≥18 and ≤80 years of age. 
2)  Written  consent  obtained  from  the  patient  (or  a  family  member  if  the  patient  was  unable  to  provide 
consent). 
3) For women of childbearing potential, an effective method of contraception (e.g. intrauterine device, oral 
contraceptive  pill)  was  required  during  treatment  and  for  a  year  following  discontinuation  of  rituximab 
treatment. 
4) Newly diagnosed cases of PV or PF diagnosed based on all of the following items: 
•  Compatible or suggestive clinical signs (Martel and Joly 2001).

Note: the recent cases of pemphigus treated prior to the diagnosis by non-specific corticosteroid therapy 
(≤0.5 mg/kg/day) proven ineffective against pemphigus were not intentionally excluded because the 
practice of a short “corticosteroid therapy trial” is quite common for undiagnosed oral erosions. 
5) Current immunization status. The investigators confirmed the immunization status of all eligible patients 
and followed the national guidelines for the immunization plan in adults, ensuring a 28-day period between 
any vaccination and the first administration of rituximab. 
Additionally, the following were considered as moderate pemphigus: 
a) Patients with non-severe oral involvement only based on Harman's criteria 
b) Patients with non-severe skin involvement only based on Harman's criteria. 
c) Patients with mucocutaneous involvement including minimal skin involvement (<5% of the body surface) 
and non-severe mucosal involvement based on Harman's criteria. 
The following were considered as severe pemphigus: 
a) Patients with mucocutaneous involvement and significant skin involvement (>5% of the body surface) 
b) Patients with only mucosal involvement affecting at least two sites (e.g., oral and genital mucosa, oral 
and anal mucosa, oral and ear, nose and throat mucosa)  
c) Patients with oral mucosal involvement only AND: 
– Weight loss of ≥3 kg related to dysphagia, 
– Severe mucosal involvement based on Harman's criteria:

prior to the administration of rituximab. 
13) Patients who have not provided their consent or who cannot be monitored regularly. 
14) Active primary or secondary immune deficiency. 
15) History of chronic or recurrent severe infection or any other underlying condition which predisposes the 
patient to severe infections. 
16) Administration of a live vaccine in the 4 weeks prior to the administration of rituximab 
17) Patients who have received immunosuppressive therapy (such as cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, 
cyclophosphamide,  azathioprine)  or  any  other  treatment  that  could  potentially  affect  pemphigus  lesions 
(disulone, IVIG, other biotherapies, plasma exchanges) in the month prior to enrollment in the trial.

Treatments 
For purpose of this study, rituximab was supplied and distributed by the applicant to the hospitals’ 
pharmacies and was dispensed for the study patient through the pharmacy. Prednisone was obtained 
commercially by the patients themselves. The use of RTX in the study is identical to the use proposed in the 
SmPC for this indication. The aim of initial prednisone therapy in combination with rituximab was to control 
the patients' lesions until rituximab took effect. 
After start in one of the two treatment arms the patients were assessed every 7 days to evaluate whether 
disease activity was ‘in control’. This was defined according to the Consensus Statement on pemphigus 
endpoints [Murrell 2008] as: "new lesions cease to form and established lesions begin to heal”. If disease 
activity was deemed ‘in control’ tapering was started [Murrell 2008] according to a predefined schedule. If 
after 4 weeks disease activity was not ‘in control’ the dose of corticosteroids remained the same up to 
another 4 weeks in the RTX arm or if disease activity was ’moderate’. Only in patients with ‘severe’ 
pemphigus who were in the corticosteroid arm the dose was increased to 2 mg/kg/day for up to another 4 
weeks. If disease activity was severe and still uncontrolled after 8 weeks in any of the treatment arms, this 
was considered treatment failure, but the patient remained in the study for follow-up. If disease activity was 
moderate and still uncontrolled after 8 weeks, patients were treated as having ‘severe’ pemphigus. 
Treatment with RTX consisted of two intravenous infusions of 1000 mg at day 1 (baseline) and day 15, 
administered at the hospital. Premedication with paradiphenhydramine antihistamine, paracetamol, and IV 
methylprednisolone was applied before each infusion. The third and fourth ‘maintenance’ infusions had a 
dose of 500 mg and were administered at 12 and 18 months after baseline (also see figure 1 above). In case 
of relapse, patients could receive 1000 mg RTX if the last infusion was longer than 16 weeks ago, and the 
next ‘maintenance dose was then omitted. 
The rationale for the initial RTX dosing (1000 mg 2 weeks apart) was based on the findings in patients with 
Rheumatoid Arthritis, where this dosing leads to B-cell depletion that is sustained for 6-9 months. This has 
also been found in a small (N=21) cohort of patients with pemphigus treated with RTX [Mouquet 2008]. 
These patients were treated with RTX in one cycle of four weekly infusions at a dosage of 375mg/m2 of body 
surface area, similar as in ANCA-positive vasculitis [Mabthera SmPC]. The rationale for the need of a 
‘maintenance’ dose was based on the observation that about 30% of patients with pemphigus relapse after 
2 years [Joly 2007]. The dose of 500 mg was supposed to prevent relapses but had not been studied in a 
dose-finding study, it had been applied in a similar way in ANCA-positive vasculitis [Guillevin 2014]. 
Treatment with prednisone was stratified according to disease severity and according to treatment group 
(Table 1). Tapering of corticosteroids for severe patients in the prednisone group will last 18 months in total, 
and for moderate patients in the RTX+prednisone group tapering will last 3 months in total (Table 1). The 
tapering schedule in the RTX group was based on earlier experience in the uncontrolled study of pemphigus 
patients (N=21) treated with RTX [Joly 2007]. Treatment with ‘high dose’ corticosteroids followed by slow 
tapering as soon disease activity is under control is regarded as standard of care [Murrell 2008].

Table 1 
Treatment of relapses was different in the two treatment groups.  
Patients in the RTX and prednisone group received one infusion of RTX 1000 mg and prednisone was 
resumed or the prednisone dose was escalated. Subsequent infusions could occur no sooner than 16 weeks 
following the previous infusion and the next scheduled ‘maintenance’ infusion was left out. For example, if 
relapse occurred during the steroid taper or if relapse occurred after discontinuation of prednisone and 
before month 12, the patient received 1000 mg RTX at the time of relapse and the scheduled month 18 
infusion of 500 mg RTX, but no infusion at month 12. If for example relapse occurred after discontinuation 
of prednisone and between month 12 and month 18, 1000 mg RTX was given at the time of relapse (no 
infusion at month 18), and if relapse occurred after month 18, the patient was treated with RTX 1000 mg at 
the time of relapse. In the event that a patient experienced more than one relapse, only the first relapse was 
treated with RTX. 
Patients in the prednisone-only treated group resumed or escalated their prednisone dose. If relapse 
occurred during the prednisone taper, the prednisone dose was increased to a prior dose level that permitted 
disease control. If relapse occurred after prednisone withdrawal, prednisone was resumed at a dose of 0.3 
mg/kg/day or 0.5 mg/kg/day depending on the severity of the relapse. 
Relapse was defined as the appearance of 3 or more new lesions a month that did not heal spontaneously 
within 1 week or the extension of established lesions in a patient who had achieved disease control [Murrell 
2008]. Presence of relapse was determined after physical examination at a study visit. 
Objectives 
The protocol specified study objectives were: 
1) To demonstrate that it was possible to control, and then to heal, the mucocutaneous lesions of patients 
with pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceus, in spite of short-term systemic corticosteroid therapy, as a 
result of the use of rituximab. 
2) To demonstrate that initial treatment with rituximab, repeated after 12 months and 18 months, helped 
achieve  prolonged  control  of  the  mucocutaneous  lesions  caused  by  pemphigus,  making  it  possible  for  a 
larger number of patients to achieve complete remission without corticosteroid therapy at 24 months and 36 
months after the start of treatment, compared to a standard regimen of systemic corticosteroid therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 17/71 
 
  
  
 
 
3) To demonstrate that the rituximab + prednisone treatment regimen was well tolerated with fewer side 
effects of systemic corticosteroid therapy. An extended follow-up period (up to 10 years) was to be carried 
out  to  ensure  the  long-term  absence  of  side  effects  (e.g.,  lymphoma,  progressive  multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy [PML]). 
4)  To  monitor  the  changes  in  biological  and  immunological  parameters  during  treatment,  namely  those 
related to activation of B lymphocytes specifically directed against desmogleins 1 and 3. In particular: the 
titer, isotype, and specificity of anti- Dsg-1 and anti-Dsg-3 antibodies, the total number of B lymphocytes 
and the number of Dsg-1-specific B lymphocytes, Dsg-3-specific B lymphocytes, B cell repertoire, Dsg-1- 
specific B-cell repertoire, and Dsg-3-specific B-cell repertoire were to be monitored. 
Any differences between the protocol-specified objectives and those included in the Applicant’s analyses and 
any objectives not carried out are presented in the section “Conduct of the study”. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the evaluation of complete remission (complete epithelialization and absence of 
new  and/or  established  lesions)  at  Month  24  without  CS  therapy  for  at  least  two  months  (“complete 
remission  off  therapy”  according  to  the  “Consensus  Treatment  Definitions  of  Disease  Endpoints  and 
Therapeutic Responses for Pemphigus” [Murrell et al. 2008]). 
Secondary Endpoints 
• 
“Severe” and “moderate” relapses at Month 24. Relapse defined as 3 or more new lesions per month that 
do  not  heal  spontaneously  within  a  week  or  extension  of  established  lesions  in  a  patient  who  has 
achieved disease control. The definitions of “severe” and “moderate” relapse correspond to the protocol 
definitions  of  severe  and  moderate  pemphigus,  but  in  addition,  if  a  relapse  remained  uncontrolled 
despite 4 weeks of prednisone dose increases to 0.5 mg/kg/d, the relapse was considered severe. 
•  Complete remission at Month 24 with minimal CS treatment (“Complete remission on minimal therapy,” 
defined  according  to  the  Consensus  Statement  (Murrell  et  al.  2008)  as  a  dose  of  prednisone  ≤  10 
mg/day). 
Total mean cumulative dose of prednisone up to Month 24. 
The  mean  duration  of  complete  remission  (healing  of  the  mucocutaneous  lesions)  without  general 
corticosteroid therapy at Month 24.  
The number of SAEs, including death, attributable to the corticosteroid therapy and/or rituximab. 
• 
• 
• 
•  Quality-of-life scores (Skindex-France [Chren et  al. 1997, Leplege et al. 2003] herein referred to as 
“Skindex”)  and  Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index  (DLQI)  [Basra  et  al.  2015])  at  baseline  (start  of 
treatment) and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24. Patient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life 
were  assessed  using  the  Skindex-  France  and  DLQI  Skin  Diseases,  both  of  which  are  validated  and 
reliable patient self-reported measures available in French that measure the impact of skin disease on 
the psychological well-being, social functioning and everyday activities of the patients. The recall period 
for the Skindex-France is the previous week and consists of eight scales, which address the following: 
cognitive  effects,  social  effects,  depression,  fear,  embarrassment,  anger,  physical  discomfort,  and 
physical limitations. The DLQI refers to the past 7 days and includes 10 questions addressing symptoms 
and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. A lower 
score for both the Skindex-France and DLQI indicates better quality of life. 
Additional Endpoints 
The following additional pharmacodynamic, safety and efficacy endpoints, including exploratory endpoints, 
were evaluated: 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 18/71 
 
  
  
• 
Percentages of CD-19+ peripheral B-lymphocytes at baseline and post-baseline study visits in the first 
37 patients randomized in the study.  
•  Retrospective anti-drug antibody (ADA) measurements at baseline, D180, D365, and D545 study visits 
in patients treated with rituximab + prednisone. 
•  Measurements  of  anti-Dsg-1  and  –Dsg-3  pathogenic  antibodies  at  baseline  and  post-baseline  study 
visits. 
•  Non-serious AEs related to trial drugs with information collected in the study CRFs, the reported grade 
of intensity (Common terminology criteria for adverse events [CTCAE] v4) and the timing. 
•  Numbers  of  relapses  (either  “severe”  or  “moderate”)  at  Month  36  (±  4  months),  for  patients  who 
achieved complete remission off prednisone therapy at Month 24 (primary endpoint). 
Data management 
CRFs were used for the prospective data collection. A Clinical Research Associate delegated by the 
sponsor-investigator (CHU Rouen) performed monitoring which included validation of 100% of critical data 
in all patients. Due diligence site visits of the Sponsor site and select investigator sites (for sites with high 
patient enrollment) were conducted by the Applicant in 2017. Overall, the findings at the site visits provided 
supportive evidence that the study was conducted according to GCP. 
Sample size 
The number of patients estimated for inclusion in the study by the Sponsor was 45 patients per treatment 
arm, for a total number of 90 patients. This number was calculated according to the primary assessment 
criterion (number of patients in complete remission, tapered off any CS treatment for at least 3 months, 
during the evaluation at M24) as described in the Protocol v3. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was centralized and performed by the Biostatistical Unit at the Rouen University Hospital. 
After determining eligibility (verifying inclusion criteria and signing the consent form), the patients were 
randomized  1:1  to  receive  one  of  the  two  treatments  (rituximab  +  prednisone  or  prednisone)  and  were 
stratified  by  severity  of  pemphigus  (moderate  or  severe).  Within  each  strata  (moderate  or  severe), 
randomization to each treatment arm was conducted using permuted blocks of size 4. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable; this was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The intention-to-treat population consisted of all randomized patients, even if no study treatment was 
received. The primary population for efficacy was the ITT population of all patients being diagnosed as 
having pemphigus vulgaris (ITT-PV). Patients with pemphigus foliaceus (PF) were analysed within the total 
ITT population for the primary outcome only. The safety population consisted of all (PV and PF) patients who 
were treated with either rituximab or protocol-specified prednisone treatment. 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint is a chi square test (or Fisher exact test in case expected cell 
frequencies are below 5). The Sponsors regarded patients who withdrew due to inefficacy of treatment, to a 
serious side event threatening the vital prognosis, enrolled by mistake and thus excluded, lost-to-follow-up, 
or died during the study, as treatment failures. The Applicant regarded patients without an assessment at 
month 24 for any reason and patients who withdrew early even if they had follow-up data at month 24 as 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 19/71 
 
  
  
treatment failures. The Applicant added a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for gender difference and a log 
binomial regression to adjust for gender and PDAI. 
An analysis using the original definition (complete remission without prednisone therapy for at least three 
months) was performed as well.  
Continuous outcomes were analysed using a t-test (if normality was not violated) or a Mann-Whitney U test 
otherwise. Chi square test (or Fisher exact test in case expected cell frequencies are below 5)were used for 
binary variables. 
For each patient in complete remission without oral corticosteroid therapy at Month 24, the average period 
during which the patient was in complete remission off corticosteroid therapy will be evaluated. Only data 
where the duration is at least 2 months will be analysed. This will be confirmed through either a yes answer 
for the CRF item “In complete remission and no longer receiving oral corticosteroid therapy for 3 months”, 
or by confirming that patient is in remission and no longer receiving prednisone at both Month 22 and Month 
24 visits. The average period will also be assessed for patients off corticosteroid therapy for 3 months, using 
only the CRF item.  
To this end, the time duration will be calculated by using, as date of origin: the date of complete remission 
without corticosteroid therapy, and as end date, the last date of visit during which no relapse was noted 
without intake of corticosteroid therapy. Since prednisone dose is not reported at Day 1, the dose reported 
at Day 7 will be assumed to apply from Day 1 to the day before Day 7. Similarly, the dose reported at 
subsequent visits will be assumed to apply from the previous visit to the day before the reporting visit. For 
missing dose, the last previous non-missing dose will be carried forward (LOCF method), except after the 
last reported nonzero dose.

In the ITT sample up to 24 months, there were n=2 (4%) withdrawals in the rituximab treatment group 
and n=13 (30%) withdrawals in the corticosteroid-only treatment group. Most of the withdrawals in the 
latter group were because of adverse events (n=8) or because of lack of effectiveness/relapse (n=4). The 
visit at month 36 (figure 1) was added by amendment, when a number of patients already had passed month 
36. Month 36 visits could be assessed in 71% of patients and was assessed post-hoc 22% and remained 
missing in 7% (Table 2).  
Table 2 
In the ITT-PV sample, n=38 patients were allocated to the rituximab group and n=36 were allocated to 
the corticosteroid-only group. In the rituximab group, one patient withdrew from treatment (because of 
pregnancy), but all n=38 patients completed the month 24 visit. In the corticosteroid-only group, n=12 
(33%) patients withdrew from treatment, while n=30 (83%) completed the month 24 visit. The number and 
reasons for withdrawal in the ITT-PV sample are shown in Table 3.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
There were a total of 13 protocol amendments; the first 2 amendments occurred before the first patient was 
enrolled under Protocol v3. Table 4 lists major changes to the protocol. In protocol v12 dated 31 March 2014, 
clinical follow-up was extended to 36 months; Due to the fact that the extension of clinical follow-up took 
place late in the study (M24 LPLV for the primary endpoint was 04 December 2014), the additional visit was 
not done at M36 for all patients. Some patients had a follow-up visit after M36 which recorded their clinical 
status  at  the  time  of  the  visit,  and  their  clinical  status  at  M36  was  retrospectively  assessed.  Extended 
follow-up of 10 years, which was included in the objectives in Protocol v14, was not performed.  
Of importance, in Protocol v13 dated 25 June 2015, the definition of complete remission off prednisone was 
modified to reflect the updated clinical guidelines on duration of complete remission off of CS (Murrell et al. 
2008). Thus, the primary efficacy endpoint was changed from CRoff CS for at least 3 months at M24 to CRoff 
CS for at least 2 months at M24. 
Protocol-Specified Study Objectives 
The protocol specified objectives included the intent to monitor changes in biological and immunological 
parameters  during  treatment,  namely  those  related  to  activation  of  B  lymphocytes  specifically  directed 
against  Dsg-1  and  Dsg-3.  This  objective  was  considered  to  be  exploratory  by  the  Applicant  and  for  the 
purposes of this CSR analyses were limited to Dsg-1 and Dsg-3 antibody levels. 
Comparison of Protocol-Specified and DAP-Specified Study Endpoints and Analyses 
A number of secondary endpoints were specified in the Sponsor’s Protocol v14.  
The key changes were: 
•  Quality of life (QoL) was assessed at additional timepoints compared to those specified in the Protocol 
v14. QoL was assessed with Skindex-France and DLQI at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24. The following 
protocol-specified secondary endpoints were not included in the Applicant’s analyses: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The number of patients with complete healing of their mucocutaneous lesions six months after the start 
of treatment. 
The number of patients with incomplete remission off treatment at M24. 
The  number  of  patients  in  complete  remission,  who  continued  on  minimal  corticosteroid  therapy 
(prednisone  10  mg/day)  at  M36  (+/-  4  months),  or  received  multiple  courses  of  corticosteroid 
therapy following one or more relapses. 
The number of patients in complete remission off treatment at M36 (+/- 4 months). The Applicant also 
performed analyses of the following additional endpoints not included in the protocol (Applicant DAP): 
Pharmacodynamic  counts  and  percentages  of  CD-19+  B-Lymphocytes  at  Baseline  and  post-Baseline 
study visits. 
•  Retrospective measurements of ADA at Baseline, D180, D365, and D545 study visits. 
•  Measurements of anti-Dsg-1 and -Dsg-3 antibodies at Baseline and post-Baseline study visits.

• 
For side effects (AEs related to trial drugs with information collected in the study CRFs), the reported 
grade of intensity (CTCAE version 4) and the timing. 
•  Numbers of relapses (either “severe” or “moderate”) at M36 (± 4 months), for patients who achieved 
complete remission off CS therapy for at least 2 months at M24. 
The Applicant also presented an analysis of selected AEs of rituximab (infections and IRRs) and infections. 
Additionally, the primary analysis was stratified by gender to assess gender effect on response; this was not 
part of the sponsor's analysis plan. 
Differences in Analysis between the Sponsor SAP and the Applicant DAP 
The Sponsor’s SAP v3 states that all analyses will be performed for the ITT population. In the Applicant’s 
DAP,  all  analyses  were  performed  for  the  PV  population;  only  selected  analyses  were  done  for  the  ITT 
population.

Major Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations were defined by the sponsor as mistakes or technical deviations which could lead 
to danger for patients and could affect the integrity of the results of the study. In the ITT population, 197 
major protocol deviations were reported in 77 patients (86%). Sponsor definitions were not reclassified or 
adjudicated by the Applicant, although upon review, many of the deviations categorized by the Sponsor as 
‘major’  did  not  meet  the  Applicant’s  standard  definition  for  a  major  protocol  deviation.  The  Applicant’s 
definition of a major protocol deviation is one that has the potential to impact patient safety, the efficacy of 
the treatment regimen, or the study analysis. Applicant review of the Sponsor’s ‘major protocol deviations’ 
concluded that these deviations as collected and classified by the Sponsor did not have an impact on the 
overall interpretation of efficacy and safety results. No protocol deviations led to withdrawal of patients from 
the study. Per-protocol analysis was not performed for this study. 
The major deviations observed in the ITT population were primarily procedural (e.g., ICF updates/versions 
not signed at the correct time [however, original ICFs were signed], information updates not signed, not 
dated, or lost) or medication-related (e.g., prednisone dose increases/decreases not per protocol guidance 
at some study visits). In the ITT-PV population, the deviations were balanced across the arms with 159 
major protocol deviations being reported in 63 patients; 75 deviations in 32 patients in the rituximab + 
prednisone arm and 84 deviations in 31 patients in the prednisone arm. 
The major deviations observed in the ITT PV population were similar to those seen in the ITT population. 
To further investigate the potential significance of these protocol deviations, the Applicant undertook site 
visits at 8 of 25 centers, including the center with the most major protocol deviations. Review of the site visit 
findings indicate that the study centers addressed the issues identified during the site visits and confirmed 
that the findings observed did not have an impact on data integrity.

Primary endpoint (CR off prednisone therapy for 2 months or more at month 24) 
At  M24,  the  proportion  of  PV  patients  with  CRoff  prednisone  for  2  months  or  more  was  statistically 
significantly higher in the rituximab + prednisone arm than in the prednisone arm (34 patients [89.5%] vs. 
10 patients [27.8%], p-value <0.0001). The unadjusted risk ratio comparing the rituximab + prednisone 
arm to the prednisone arm was 3.2 (95% CI 1.9, 5.5; p-value <0.0001). Similar risk ratios were obtained 
when adjusted for gender and baseline PDAI scores in a log-binomial model (3.2 [95% CI 1.9, 5.6; p-value 
0.0001] and 3.0 [95% CI 1.7, 5.2; p-value 0.0001], respectively). 
Results from logistic regression models are presented. The unadjusted odds ratio was 22.1 (95% CI 6.2, 
78.5; p-value <0.0001). After adjusting for gender, the odds ratio was 23.0 (95% CI 6.1, 87.3; p-value 
0.0001) and after adjusting for baseline PDAI score, the odds ratio was 19.6 (95% CI 5.4, 70.5; p-value 
<0.0001).Gender breakdown of the primary endpoint by treatment arm was as follows: 90.9% and 28.6% 
for  males;  and  88.9%  and  26.7%  for  females  between  rituximab  +  prednisone  and  prednisone  arms, 
respectively. 
Secondary outcomes 
An overview of the results on secondary outcomes is provided in table 11. All between-group differences in 
secondary outcomes were in favour of the rituximab treated group.

Table 11 
The duration of remission while off corticosteroids (in patients who were responders at month 24) was longer 
in the rituximab group as compared to the corticosteroid-only treated group.  
At 24 months, the proportion of patients in clinical remission while receiving a minimal dose of prednisone (
≤10 mg/day) in the rituximab group was identical to the proportion of patients off corticosteroids, but in the 
corticosteroid-only group there were 2 patients more as compared to the primary outcome (off 
corticosteroids).  
In the rituximab treated group, the number of patients having had severe/moderate relapses up to month

24 was smaller than in the corticosteroid-only group (Table 12). Also, the number of patients having had 
more than one relapse was larger in the corticosteroid-only treated group.  
Table 12 
The cumulative dose of prednisone used in the rituximab treated group was about 30% of the cumulative 
dose used in the corticosteroid-only group (Figure 13). 
Table 13 
In the period between month 24 and month 36, there were 11 patients with a relapse in the 
corticosteroid-only treated group. There were two patients in the rituximab group who had a relapse, one of 
them had been in remission (CRoff) at month 24 (Table 14).  There were 94% (32/34) of patients who 
maintained CRoff in the rituximab group and 60% (6/10) who maintained CRoff in the corticosteroid-only 
group.

Skindex-France 
The  total  Skindex-France  score  is  calculated  on  a  scale  of  0  to  100  where  higher  scores  mean  greater 
impairment of the patient’s health-related QoL. Completion rates for the Skindex questionnaire were >70% 
in the rituximab + prednisone arm and >55% in the prednisone arm (Table 15).

Table 15 
The mean Skindex-France score at baseline (Day 1) was lower in the rituximab + prednisone arm than in the 
prednisone  arm  (52.9  vs.  61.3).  The  mean  change  from  baseline  (SD)  at  M3  was  -28.6  (24.47)  in  the 
rituximab + prednisone arm and -28.3 (22.92) in the prednisone arm. At M24, the mean Skindex-France 
score was 12.3 in the rituximab + prednisone arm compared to 21.5 in the prednisone arm. Mean change 
from baseline (SD) at M24 was -40.5 (22.84) in the rituximab + prednisone arm and -37.5 (23.22) in the 
prednisone arm. Similar results were obtained when Skindex-France scores were analyzed by mixed model 
repeated measures (MMRM). At the M24 visit, estimated mean change from baseline (SD) was -39.6 (4.39) 
in the rituximab + prednisone arm and -35.6 (5.03) in the prednisone arm. 
Dermatology life quality index 
A total DLQI score is calculated on a scale of 0 to 30 where higher scores mean greater impairment of the 
patient’s health-related QoL. A change in DLQI scores is considered clinically meaningful when a patient’s 
DLQI  score  changed  by  at  least  4  points  from  the  previous  score.  Completion  rates  for  the  DLQI 
questionnaire were >85% in the rituximab + prednisone arm and >70% in the prednisone arm (Table 22). 
Mean  score  improvements  were  clinically  meaningful  at  M3  for  both  arms  and  the  improvement  was 
maintained in both arms until M24 (Figure 4).

Design 
This was a Phase III, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multi-center, 
investigator-sponsored study. Patients with newly diagnosed pemphigus 
(vulgaris or foliaceus) were randomised 1:1 to receive rituximab in 
combination with short-term, low dose systemic corticosteroids (oral 
prednisone) or standard dose systemic corticosteroid therapy, for 24 months. 
Randomisation was stratified for disease severity. A follow-up visit was 
performed at month 36. Main analyses were performed in the majority 
subgroup of patients with pemphigus vulgaris.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has provided the results of the study MM22196, an open-label, phase III, multicentre, and 
randomised study in patients with newly diagnosed moderate to severe pemphigus. The study was run by 
academia (Rouen University Hospital, France). The MAH had no role in study design, conduct, data collection 
or publication of results. The database was transferred from the Sponsor to the MAH in December 2016 after 
database lock.  
The open-label nature of the study may have led to bias, e.g. by overestimation of the beneficial effects of 
rituximab and/or overestimation of adverse events in the corticosteroid-only treated group. It is considered 
that also well designed and well conducted trials are prone to bias if open label, instead of double blinded. 
Especially, the primary outcome (clinical remission off corticosteroids for at least 2 months) is vulnerable for 
bias, since it relies completely on physician’s judgement regarding the examination of lesions as well as the 
decisions regarding tapering. The primary outcome is thus not completely objective. The degree of 
experience/training of the investigators and standardisation of outcome assessment may contribute to 
reduction of bias due to the open-label design, although they cannot completely prevent it. Therefore, the 
CHMP requested sensitivity analyses, which are critical in assuring that a substantial part of the observed 
effects could not be explained by bias, and that accounting for the size of probable bias will not reduce the 
size of the treatment effects beyond clinical meaningfulness.  
The  main  objective  of  the  study  was  to  investigate  the  possibility  to  control  disease  with  rituximab  in 
combination  with  low-dose  and  short-term  use  of  CS.  One  primary  endpoint,  several  secondary  and 
exploratory endpoints are defined. The primary endpoint is fully acceptable from a clinical point of view. The 
secondary  endpoints  are  clinically  meaningful  and  relevant  endpoints  that  all  supplement  the  primary 
endpoint. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary outcome as originally proposed by the sponsor-investigator, CRoff for 3 months, was changed 
post-hoc by the Applicant to CRoff for 2 months, in reference to the outcome guideline [Harman 2008]. The 
original outcome (CRoff for 3 months) is also presented, which is understood as sensitivity analysis rather 
than as secondary outcome or co-primary outcome; correction for multiplicity is therefore unnecessary. 
According to the protocol and CRF, photographs were taken at all time points. However, according to the 
Applicant, photographs were not taken systematically and standardized methods for photographic 
assessment were not implemented in this study. Unfortunately, blinded assessment of photographs is no 
option to at least partly circumvent the unblinded nature of the study. 
Patient global assessment (PGA), Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI) and the Autoimmune Bullous Skin 
Disorder Intensity Score (ABSIS) questionnaires were included in the CRF just before the questions on 
clinical status, apparently for a validation study. PDAI and ABSIS are regarded as established instruments 
for pemphigus [Harman 2017]. The Applicant was asked to discuss the validity and reliability of including 
PGA, PDAI and ABSIS as outcomes and include them in the results if justifiable. It is understood that results 
on PDAI and ABSIS will be separately reported, as validation study but not in the context of the current 
study. This is accepted; PDAI and ABSIS will not necessarily add to the interpretation of the treatment 
effects. 
The primary and secondary outcomes concentrate on month 24 and month 36. However, it is considered 
clinically  relevant  to  also  assess  the  disease  course  between  baseline  and  month  24.  Therefore,  the 
Applicant was asked to perform between-group analyses of appropriate outcomes, for example: proportion 
of  patients  ‘in  control’  (start  of  tapering),  time-to-clinical  remission,  time-to-first-relapse,  proportions  of 
patients in CRoff for all time points, patients in CR for all time points, patients with minimal corticosteroids 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 39/71 
 
  
  
at all time points, PGA, PDAI and ABSIS over time. The outcomes (1-7) of intermediate time points between 
baseline and month 24 support the efficacy of rituximab+prednisone versus high dose prednisone. Some of 
the results, e.g. time to CRoff for 2 months and prednisone use ≤10 mg/day might be considered for the 
EPAR. Also for that purpose, survival curves would have been preferred over analysis of medians for the 
‘time-to-event’ data. Despite baseline differences in PDAI of median (P25-P75) 55 (27-63) in the prednisone 
arm versus 26 (14-41) in the rituximab+prednisone arm, in both arms PDAI reduced to a median of 0 in 6 
months. 
Baseline demographics showed an imbalance with regard to gender, but this is not expected to have any 
major impact on the interpretation of results. Overall, the baseline disease characteristics are well-balanced.  
Maintenance treatment /choice of dose 
 The studied initial dose of rituximab 2x1000 mg iv 2 weeks apart was chosen because of its known B-cell 
depleting effects, which is acceptable as rationale for choice in this confirmatory ‘phase 3’ trial. B-cell 
depleting effects were also seen in a small (n=21) cohort of patients with pemphigus treated with rituximab 
in a regimen as for ANCA-positive Vasculitis, which is supportive. Premedication was given before infusion 
with rituximab, in agreement with the SmPC for rheumatoid arthritis. 
The studied maintenance dose of rituximab was 500 mg iv at months 12 and 18, which had been applied in 
ANCA-positive vasculitis. The rationale was to prevent the common relapses in pemphigus, which is 
accepted as rationale for its choice in the phase 3 study.  
The maintenance treatment wording as proposed in the SmPC was discussed with the applicant during the 
assessment and agreed as follows :  
“A maintenance infusion of 500 mg IV should be administered at months 12 and 18, and then every 6 
months thereafter if needed,  based on clinical evaluation.” 
Treatment of relapses 
For pemphigus vulgaris, retreatment to prevent relapses or to treat residual disease activity other than 
flares is currently unjustified. 
For treatment of relapses it is proposed in the SmPC to administer rituximab 1 x 1000 mg, not sooner than 
16 weeks after a previous infusion with rituximab. Corticosteroid treatment may be resumed. This is similar 
as performed in the study and could therefore be agreed. The period of 16 weeks comes from the experience 
in RA, which is accepted. According to the MAH, findings in RA patients demonstrated peripheral B-cell 
recovery between 6 to 9 months after treatment, and as early as 16 weeks. It can be assumed that the B-cell 
depleting effects of rituximab are similar for RA patients and PV patients. 
It is agreed that corticosteroid is used concomitant to rituximab, to ‘bridge’ the period that rituximab will 
begin to become effective. This is in line with treatment guidelines for pemphigus for start of immune 
suppressive treatment [Harman 2017]. There are no firm guidelines for starting dose, tapering and 
treatment of flares using corticosteroids in pemphigus, but the implemented corticosteroid schemes are in 
line with treatment guidelines [Murrell 2008; Harman 2017]. This includes that it is waited for 3-4 weeks or 
longer till disease activity is ‘in control’ before tapering is started, as was performed in the study. 
The criteria for disease activity being ‘in control’ and for ‘flares’ were in agreement with established 
consensus definitions [Murrell 2008]. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  study  met  its  primary  endpoint  showing  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  difference 
between  the  treatment  arms  in  favour  of  rituximab.  In  total  89.5%  (34/38)  of  the  patients  in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 40/71 
 
  
  
rituximab+prednisone arm had CR off prednisone therapy for at least 2 months at month 24. In comparison 
only  27.8%  (10/36)  of  the  patients  in  the  prednisone  arm  experienced  CR  off  prednisone  for  at  least  2 
months at month 24. Looking at CRoff prednisone for at least 3 months at month 24 (the original primary 
endpoint) similar results are observed. No single centre was dominating the inclusion, which is supportive for 
robustness of the results.  
Differences in baseline variables between treatment groups were overall relatively small, except for gender 
and PDAI for which sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome were performed. Importantly, disease 
severity and pattern of lesions were similar at baseline. 
In the primary outcome, clinical remission off corticosteroids for at least 2 months (at month 24), there was 
a numerically large and statistically highly significant (p<0.0001) treatment effect between the rituximab 
group (90%) and the corticosteroid-only group (28%). The size of this treatment effect would be regarded 
as clinically relevant. The results are supported by the results of the sensitivity analyses (CRoff for 3 months, 
CRoff in total PF+PV sample, correction for gender and for baseline PDAI). There was no evidence for 
confounding, or effect modification, by gender. 
According to the sensitivity analyses: a) if patients in the prednisone arm who withdrew from treatment or 
did not complete the month 24 visit were assumed to be responders, the effect in CRoff for 
rituximab+prednisone versus high dose prednisone was: 90% versus 62%, and it can be calculated that the 
95%-CI for the difference is above 6.8%; b) if patients in the prednisone arm who withdrew from treatment 
or did not complete the month 24 visit were removed from analysis, the effect in CRoff was 90% versus 
42%; c) a conservative CRoff in the rituximab+prednisone arm just lower that the lower limit of the 95%CI 
for the rituximab+prednisone arm of 74% supported the robustness of the treatment effects in the sense 
that the difference would still at least be 20% (according to the 95%-CI for the difference). This argument 
can be taken a few steps further: if the rituximab+prednisone arm would have a response rate of 68.4% 
(26/38), 63.2% (24/38), 57.9% (22/38), 52.6% (20/38) then the difference would still at least be 15%, 
10%, 5%, 0% respectively.  
The explanation of the MAH that the probable bias due to the open-label design on the cumulative 
corticosteroid exposure would have been in favour of the high-dose corticosteroids (ie. in fact turned out to 
be conservative) is not followed. If patients on rituximab+prednisone who relapsed and still achieved CRoff 
at month 24 were treated as non-responders, the effect in CRoff would be 76% for rituximab+prednisone 
versus 30% for high dose prednisone. Overestimation of relapse in the high dose prednisone group was not 
considered by the applicant. 
In summary, it cannot be excluded that bias occurred in favour of rituximab+prednisone through the 
open-label design of the study. However, the treatment effect was large and the sensitivity analyses show 
that it is unlikely that the ‘real’ treatment effect is clinically insignificant.The results of all secondary 
outcomes were supportive for the results of the primary outcome. For the between-group differences 
regarding corticosteroid-related adverse events it is referred to the safety section.  
The duration of remission while off corticosteroids (in patients who were responders at month 24) was longer 
in the rituximab group as compared to the corticosteroid-only treated group. The MAH confirmed that 
duration of remission was cumulative.  
Prednisone dose is more appropriately presented as median (P25-P75) instead of using mean. The Applicant 
was asked to adapt the graphical presentation (Figure 9) for median corticosteroid dose and to supply a 
graph with proportions of patients off corticosteroids or using a minimal dose (≤10 mg/day) of 
corticosteroids. The graphical presentations of median prednisone dose over time and of no-or-minimal 
(≤10 mg/day) prednisone dose are considered to be supportive for the claimed steroid sparing effect of 
rituximab. This is now reflected in the SmPC.

The study has been performed in patients with newly diagnosed pemphigus vulgaris, however considering 
the unmet medical need, the strong biological rationale, and the consistency of the published evidence on 
PD, efficacy and safety of rituximab in established PV, it is accepted that the indication include patients with 
established PV. There are nevertheless uncertainties due to the limitations of the data provided in the 
established disease. The CHMP considered that additional data are necessary to confirm the benefit of 
Mabthera in the subgroup of patients with established disease. The ongoing study in the relapsed setting, 
study WA29330 (PEMPHIX) will provide additional key information on the benefits and risks of Mabthera in 
these patients. The recruitment is completed and the preliminary and final analyses of this study should be 
provided post-approval. The results of ongoing study WA29330 in established PV will lead to SmPC changes, 
particularly in section 5.1. 
The restriction of the main analyses to patients with pemphigus vulgaris is endorsed, based on the difference 
in numbers and differences in pathogenesis and prognosis with pemphigus foliaceus. Extrapolation to 
patients with pemphigus foliaceus is not attempted. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall,  the  study  met  its  primary  endpoint,  showing  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant 
difference in favour of the rituximab arm. All secondary endpoints support the findings in primary endpoint. 
The use of rituximab in combination with prednisone was studied in patients newly diagnosed with 
pemphigus vulgaris, but the claimed indication includes patients with established pemphigus vulgaris 
(relapsed setting). The MAH has justified the extrapolation, which includes a PK, PD, efficacy and safety 
discussion, by reasoning as well as by the already provided supporting evidence. This is acceptable to the 
CHMP. There are nevertheless uncertainties due to the limitations of the data provided in the established 
disease. The ongoing study will provide further information key to the benefit risk of Mabthera in the 
subgroup of patients with established disease. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Introduction 
MabThera (rituximab) has been registered since 1998, for the treatment of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL). Since 2006, MabThera has also been registered for the treatment of 
severe  rheumatoid  arthritis,  in  patients  who  cannot  be  treated  with  other  DMARDs  including 
TNFalpa-inhibitors.  In  2013,  MabThera  was  approved  for  the  treatment  of  other  AI  (auto-immune) 
disorders, i.e. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). GPA/MPA is also 
called ANCA-vasculitis. 
Case report forms in this study were designed to collect non-serious treatment-related AEs and related and 
unrelated SAEs. Non-serious treatment-related AEs are those that were recorded on the AE page of the CRF 
and exclude IRR symptoms which were reported on a separate CRF page. Treatment-related AEs refer to 
both treatment-related AEs and treatment-related SAEs. 
Safety data is analyzed and presented for the Safety PV population and DAP specified analyses were also 
performed on the full Safety population.

Treatment-related adverse events by intensity 
Treatment-related AEs were categorized by intensity using CTCAE v4: mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), 
severe  (Grade  3),  and  life-threatening  (Grade  4).  In  the  rituximab  +  prednisone  arm,  28  Grade  3 
treatment-related AEs were seen in 11 patients; in the prednisone arm, 53 Grade 3 treatment-related AEs 
were seen in 19 patients. The most frequent Grade 3 treatment-related AEs by PT (>= 5% 
in either treatment arm [rituximab + prednisone vs. prednisone]) were Cushing’s syndrome (15.8% vs. 
16.7%), muscle disorder (2.6% vs. 22.2%), myopathy (0% vs. 11.1%), fungal infection (5.3% vs. 5.6%), 
intervertebral disc compression (5.3% vs. 5.6%), major depression (5.3% vs. 2.8%), skin disorder (5.3% 
vs. 0%),), cataract (0% vs. 5.6%), lung disorder (0% vs. 5.6%), and weight increased (0% vs. 5.6%). In 
the rituximab + prednisone arm, 7 Grade 4 treatment-related AEs were seen in 2 patients (5.3%) and the 
PTs  were:  infective  thrombosis,  intervertebral  discitis,  sepsis,  staphylococcal  sepsis,  lung  disorder, 
pulmonary embolism, and femoral neck fracture. In the prednisone arm, 4 Grade 4 treatment-related AEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019

were seen in 3 patients (8.3%) and the PTs were: Cushing’s syndrome (2.8%), weight increased (5.6%), 
and cardiac failure (2.8%).  
There were no Grade 5 events in either treatment arm.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs) 
Potential AEs related to infusions could be reported by investigators in two ways: as symptoms reported on 
the symptoms of intolerance to infusion CRF page and/or as AEs on the AE CRF page. Potential symptoms of 
intolerance to infusions underwent medical review by the Applicant. IRRs from either CRF page are found in 
Table 33. Overall, 22 patients [57.9%] experienced an IRR in the rituximab + prednisone arm (Table 29).

IRR symptoms reported in >=5% (2 or more patients) for the Day 1 or Day 15 infusions were: headaches, 
chills,  high  blood  pressure,  nausea,  asthenia,  and  pain  (Table  24).  All  IRRs  noted  on  the  symptoms  of 
intolerance CRF page by the investigators were Grades 1 or 2.

Infections: 
Treatment-Related Infections – Safety PV Population 
Fourteen patients (36.8%) in the rituximab + prednisone arm experienced 43 treatment-related infections 
and 15 patients (41.7%) in the prednisone arm experienced 28 treatment-related infections (Table 34). 
The most frequent infection PTs (occurring in >=5% in either treatment arm [rituximab + prednisone arm 
vs.  prednisone),  were:  bronchitis  (3  patients  [7.9%]  vs.  7  patients  [19.4%]),  urinary  tract  infection  (2 
patients [5.3%] vs. 3 patients [8.3%]), fungal infection (2 patients [5.3%] vs. 2 patients [5.6%]), skin 
bacterial infection (1 patient [2.6%] vs. 3 patients [8.3%]), herpes virus infection (3 patients [7.9%] vs. 0 
patients), herpes zoster (2 patients [5.3%] vs. 1 patient [2.8%]), oral herpes (2 patients [5.3%] vs. and 1 
patient [2.8%]), and conjunctivitis (2 patients [5.3%] vs. 0 patients). 
Table 26 
 Serious Infections – Safety PV Population 
In the rituximab + prednisone arm, 3 patients (7.9%) experienced 5 serious infections. In the prednisone 
arm,  1  patient  (2.8%)  experienced  1  serious  infection.  The  PTs  for  serious  infections  (rituximab  + 
prednisone arm vs. prednisone) were Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (1 patient in each treatment arm), 
infective thrombosis (1 patient vs. 0 patients), intervertebral discitis (1 patient vs. 0 patients), lung infection 
(1 patient vs. 0 patients), and staphylococcal sepsis (1 patient vs. 0 patients). 
Development of anti-drug antibodies and safety observations 
Eighteen  of  20  (90%)  ADA  positive  (at  any  time,  including  at  baseline)  PV  patients  experienced  130 
treatment-related AEs, and 10/14 (71.4%) ADA negative patients experienced 69 treatment-related AEs. 
The most frequent SOC in both groups was Injury, poisoning and procedural complications, driven by IRRs 
that occurred in 14/20 (70.0%) ADA positive patients and 6/14 (42.9%) ADA negative patients. However, 
among the 14 ADA positive patients with IRRs, there were 7 patients in whom IRRs occurred after ADAs were 
detected. All IRRs in patients tested for ADA were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 or 2). There were 
no lifethreatening/ fatal IRRs or withdrawals due to IRR in these ADA positive and ADA negative patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 49/71 
 
  
  
 
 
Of the 6 patients who were ADA positive at baseline (prior to receiving rituximab), 4 patients experienced 
IRRs. Of the 14/34 patients (41.2%) who were ADA negative at baseline but developed at least one positive 
ADA titer during the course of the study, 10 patients experienced an IRR; however in only 3 of them IRR 
occurred after development of a positive ADA titer (data on file). Thus, among ADA positive patients (4 
baseline  positives  and  3  with  treatment-induced  ADA),  7/20  patients  (35.0%)  experienced  an  IRR  after 
development of a positive ADA titer compared to 6/14 (42.9%) patients who experienced an IRR in the ADA 
negative group.  
Overall, the frequency and nature of treatment-related AEs were similar in ADA positive and ADA negative 
PV patients and consistent with the known safety profile of rituximab. 
Literature overview 
From the in total of 805 publications mentioning PV and rituximab, 34 publications were found relevant that 
had >10 patients with pemphigus and discussed safety/ efficacy findings regarding the use of rituximab. The 
rituximab  dosage  used  in  these  studies  was  similar  as  currently  proposed  for  the  PV  indication  in  this 
application. The relevant literature articles refer to approximately 1009  patients, of which 756 patients were 
treated for PV and 79 for PF. In 174 patients the type of pemphigus was not specified. 
Of  the  total  34  publications,  26  publications  reported  good  tolerance,  without  serious  events.  8/34 
publications reported fatal cases. In none of these cases, cause of death was attributed to rituximab by the 
author. Serious infections and IRRs were reported in two and seven patients, respectively in two and four 
publications,  respectively.  Side  effects  with  rituximab  occurred  mainly  during  the  first  infusions.  The 
majority of these included mild to moderate IRRs and non-serious infections. Acute complications such as 
angioedema were rarely reported during rituximab infusion and were well manageable.  
Company’s Safety Database 
A total of 2667 AEs reported in 736 cases were retrieved from the Roche global safety database with the 
indication “Pemphigus” using the search strategy. There were 71 cases which contained no information of a 
Preferrred Term, which  were also excluded from further analysis. Overall, 323/665 (48.6%) of the cases 
were considered serious.  
In  comparison,  104,227  AEs  (reported  in  34,021  cases)  and  9122  AEs  (reported  in  2,554  cases)  were 
obtained from this database for the approved AI indications RA and AAV, respectively.

Most common reported SOC were skin reactions. The SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders showed 
a higher reporting rate (17%) for the pemphigus indication as compared to RA (5.5%) and AAV (5.0%). The 
most frequently reported AEs (55%) in this SOC were pemphigus and pemphigoid, which actually describes 
the  underlying  disease.  Six  cases  reported  Stevens-Johnson  Syndrome  (SJS  ,  n  =  4)/  Toxic  Epidermal 
Necrolysis (TEN , N=2) which is an important identified risk for rituximab. Of these six cases, four cases had 
alternative  explanation  or  reported  other  risk  factors  (concomitant  medications  such  as  azathioprine, 
co-trimoxazole etc.) for the event. There was no case which showed a likely causal association of the event 
with rituximab. 
Furthermore, most common spontaneous reported AEs were IRR, GI disorders, infections and headache. No 
new safety concerns were identified.

Serious Adverse Events by Intensity – PV Population 
SAEs were categorized by intensity using CTCAE v4: mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), 
and  life-threatening  (Grade  4).  Two  patients  (5.3%)  experienced  6  Grade  3  SAEs  in  the  rituximab  + 
prednisone  arm  and  6  patients  (16.7%)  experienced  10  Grade  3  SAEs  in  the  prednisone  arm.  In  the 
rituximab + prednisone arm, Grade 3 events occurred in 1 patient each in the following PTs: arthralgia, 
myalgia, headache, malaise, nausea, and vertigo. In the prednisone arm, Grade 3 SAEs occurred in 1 patient 
each  in  the  following  PTs:  myopathy,  lumbar  spinal  stenosis,  osteonecrosis,  tendonitis,  pulmonary 
embolism,  sciatica,  hypertension,  phlebitis,  pemphigus,  and  chorioretinopathy.  In  the  rituximab  + 
prednisone arm, 7 Grade 4 SAEs were observed in 2 patients in the following PTs: pulmonary embolism 
(5.3%),  venous  thrombosis  limb  (2.6%),  infective  thrombosis  (2.6%),  intervertebral  discitis  (2.6%), 
staphylococcal sepsis (2.6%), and femoral neck fracture (2.6%). In the prednisone arm, 4 Grade 4 SAEs 
were seen in 3 patients in the following PTs: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (2.8%), weight increased 
(5.6%), and Cushing’s syndrome (2.8%). There were no Grade 5 SAEs.

Laboratory findings 
Testing of clinical chemistry and haematology parameters was performed locally and was not reported in the 
study database -though abnormalities could be reported as AEs in the CRF-. Only cases reported were blood 
sodium  abnormal  (1  case  of  each  study  group),  one  case  of  anemia  (rituximab  group)  and  one  case  of 
lymphopenia (prednisone group). None of them were reported as serious.  
Anti-drug antibodies  
The main PV study did not have a prospective plan for immunogenicity assessment as part of the study 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 55/71 
 
  
  
 
 
 
protocol.  Immunogenicity  data  of  Human  Anti-Chimeric  Antibody  [HACA]  was  analysed  as  a  post-hoc 
evaluation by the Applicant from available stored serum samples. In total, 20/34 (58.8%) patients had at 
least one positive HACA titre at any time during the study. To be noted, 5 subjects had already HACAs at 
baseline, which increased after rituximab treatment.  
The incidence of HACA is higher than reported for other indications in earlier studies. For comparison, a total 
of 392/3095 (12.7%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis tested positive for HACA in clinical studies following 
therapy with MabThera. However, it is noted that comparisons between studies is challenging, given 
differences in assay specificity/sensitivity. HACA was not associated with an increased risk of IRR or loss of 
efficacy in the main study. Therefore, no further questions are raised. 
Haematology and clinical chemistry data were not systematically reported. Neutropenia is known to be 
common for rituximab in the treatment of other auto-immune disorders, however, this was not reported in 
the PV study.  
Safety in special populations 
No analyses were made with regards to intrinsic or extrinsic factors.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No additional information on potential drug-drug interactions was obtained from Study ML22196. 
Therapeutic antibodies such as rituximab are not metabolized via cytochrome P450 and accordingly, the 
rituximab label (Rituxan USPI/EU SmPC) states that formal drug interaction studies have not been 
performed with rituximab.  In clinical trials of patients with RA, concomitant administration of MTX or 
cyclophosphamide did not alter the pharmacokinetics of rituximab.   
In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia, rituximab did not alter systemic exposure to fludarabine or 
cyclophosphamide. In patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, renal toxicity has been seen in patients treated 
with cisplatin; therefore the combination of cisplatin and rituximab is not an approved treatment regimen. 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of RA patients suggested that co-administration with 
cyclophosphamide, MTX, or glucocorticoids has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. 
Furthermore, as the elimination of rituximab is mediated by both the specific CD20 − receptor-mediated 
pathway and the non-specific immunoglobulin G clearance pathway, rituximab is not expected to interact 
with other drugs through protein binding, effects on cytochrome P450 activity, renal excretion, and/or 
competition for common drug transporter proteins. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There was 1 pregnancy in a patient in the rituximab+prednisone arm during the ML22196 study; the patient 
delivered a healthy baby with no subsequent AEs reported.  Eight pregnancy-related events in patients with 
pemphigus in the rituximab+prednisone arm were reported in the applicant’s global safety database, of 
which 1 was pregnancy of partner.  No adverse pregnancy outcomes were observed in patients treated with 
rituximab except in the case of pregnancy of partner, where the baby was preterm and had low birth weight.  
However, this case contained no perinatal details or details about the patient’s partner, which would allow a 
meaningful assessment. 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of rituximab in pregnant women.  Post marketing data 
indicate that B-cell lymphocytopenia generally lasting less than 6 months can occur in infants exposed to 
rituximab in-utero.  Rituximab was detected postnatally in the serum of infants exposed in-utero. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019

Reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys at maternal exposures similar to human therapeutic 
exposures showed no evidence of teratogenic effects as described in the labeling for rituximab (Rituxan 
USPI/MabThera SmPC).  However, B-cell lymphoid tissue was reduced in the offspring of treated dams.  The 
B-cell counts returned to normal levels, and immunologic function was restored within 6 months of birth 
(Rituximab PBRER [Report no. 1073199]). 
PV is a serious life-threatening condition that requires treatment.  Rituximab should be used during 
pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse Events That Led to Withdrawal of Study Treatment – Safety PV Population 
AEs leading to protocol withdrawal were collected on the End of Study (EoS) CRF page, and if an SAE, also 
on  the  SAE  form.  All  AEs  leading  to  protocol  withdrawal  in  this  study  were  SAEs.  In  the  rituximab  + 
prednisone  arm,  1  patient  out  of  38  patients  (2.6%)  withdrew  from  study  treatment  due  to  the  AE  of 
pregnancy, which was reported as an SAE by the Investigator.  
The Applicant identified an instance where there was a discrepancy in the data collected on the EoS page and 
the SAE form for a PV prednisone patient (19-059) resulting in showing this patient's reason for protocol 
withdrawal  as  'ineffectiveness  of  treatment'  and  7  PV  patients  in  the  prednisone  arm  whose  reason  for 
withdrawal was an AE; whereas in tae018se, this patient is counted among the 8 patients in the prednisone 
arm who had an AE leading to protocol withdrawal. Therefore, in the prednisone arm, 8 patients out of 36 
patients (22.2%) withdrew from study treatment due to 10 AEs of which all 10 were SAEs (Table 25). AEs 
leading to withdrawal in the prednisone arm were largely related to corticosteroid use and included necrosis 
of the femoral heads, corticosteroid-induced myopathy, Cushing’s syndrome, psychiatric decompensation, 
and chorioretinitis. The listing of any AE leading to protocol withdrawal is lae009se. Narratives for all patients 
who experienced SAEs are provided. 
Adverse events that led to dose modification 
One PV patient in the rituximab + prednisone treatment group had the second rituximab infusion delayed 
due to bronchitis.  
Dose  modifications  of  prednisone  were  not  collected  in  the  study.  Prednisone  doses  could  have  been 
escalated with relapse or failure to respond. Other than in these situations, doses given that deviated from 
the protocol can be seen in the listing of protocol deviations (lds004ap). 
Post marketing experience 
Rituximab is not marketed in any country for the indication of PV.  No new safety signals were identified in 
the ML22196 study compared with the overall rituximab safety data in approved AI indications as presented 
in the PBRER (Report 1073199). 
The proven and observed benefit of rituximab in clinical trials and clinical practice far outweighs the known 
and generally manageable identified risks associated with rituximab treatment. 
Since the international birth data (26 November 1997) until 30 September 2016, approximately 5,378,160 
patient-market exposures have been estimated for rituximab: 
• 
• 
– 
– 
Hematological malignancies: approximately 4,431,334 
AI indications: Approximately 946,826 (approximately 554,080 unique patients)

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the majority of patients in both treatment arms experienced treatment-related AEs, however, there 
are significant differences in favour of the rituximab arm with regards to SAEs, treatment-related SAEs and 
withdrawal of study treatment. Looking at AEs occurring >= 10% of patients it is seen that in most SOCs the 
rituximab+prednisone  arm  fares  better,  which  is  most  likely  explained  by  the  fact  that  exposure  to 
prednisone was considerable lower in this arm. However, in two SOCs (“injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications” and “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders”) rituximab+prednisone arm fares worse than 
the prednisone arm. This is related to IRR. Following AEs occurred frequently in the rituximab-prednisone 
arm: IRR, insomnia,  Cushing’s syndrome, arthralgia, asthenia, persistent depressive order and alopecia. 
These are all well-known AEs related to rituximab and clearly reflected in the SmPC, except for Cushing’s 
syndrome, which is related to prednisone. 
The  use  of  rituximab  in  combination  with  prednisone  did  not  lead  to  an  increase  in  infections.  This  is 
reassuring. However, the numbers are small and no clear pattern can be observed. 
There  were  no  deaths  in  this  study,  and  overall  there  were  more  patients  in  the  prednisone  arm  who 
experienced  an  SAE,  however,  looking  at  the  number  of  SAEs  there  is  no  difference  between  the  two 
treatment arms.  Looking at SAEs with an incidence of >=5%, most SAEs are related to musculoskeletal 
system.  Some  of  these  SAEs,  e.g.  osteoporotic  fracture,  are  related  to  prednisone,  while  other,  e.g. 
arthralgia, are related to rituximab. The majority of events occurred in only one patient.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the use of rituximab in combination with low-dose prednisone was well-tolerated. No new safety 
finding were observed during the study, and the observed AEs/SAEs are in line with the well-known and 
well-characterised safety profile of rituximab.  However an update of section 4.8 of the SmPC was introduced 
in order to reflect the safety profile observed in patients with PV.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated.The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require 
user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The MAH seeks regulatory approval for rituximab in the following indication: 
Rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare, serious and life-threatening autoimmune blistering disease affecting the 
mucosa and skin, and there is a high unmet medical need for safer and more effective treatment options. 
Due to the rarity of pemphigus, few prospective clinical trials are available and these are limited by the low 
numbers of patients studied and treatment arms that do not demonstrate statistically significant differences.   
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 66/71 
 
  
  
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Corticosteroids and, in some European countries, azathioprine are the only EU-approved treatments for 
patients with PV.  Systemic corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for pemphigus patients 
since the 1950s based on limited and uncontrolled clinical data.  Similarly, the use of adjuvant 
immunosuppressant therapy, such as azathioprine, which has been approved alone and in combination with 
systemic corticosteroids, for the treatment of PV in the European Union for over 15 years, has been 
established in treatment guidelines in Europe despite the scarcity of well-designed randomized controlled 
studies, and evidence that adjuvant therapies have only a minimal steroid-sparing effect. 
Based on the literature, chronic and/or high dose corticosteroid therapy alone results in an estimated 
remission rate of <30%.  Remission may be short lived. Serious and sometimes fatal AEs, resulting from 
immunosuppression due to long-term use of steroids, may occur.  Despite widespread use, there is no 
consensus on whether unapproved steroid-sparing agents are beneficial due to the scarcity of well-designed 
randomized controlled studies.  PV remains a serious life-threatening disease and given the unsatisfactory 
safety and efficacy profile of the existing approved therapies (corticosteroids and azathioprine), a major 
unmet medical need exists for safer and more effective novel, targeted mechanism-based treatment options 
for moderately to severely active PV. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH has provided study MM22196, an open-label, phase III, multicentre, and randomised study in 
patients with newly diagnosed moderate to severe pemphigus. The study was run by academia (Rouen 
University Hospital, France). The MAH had no role in study design, conduct, data collection or publication of 
results. The database was transferred from the Sponsor to the MAH in December 2016 after database lock. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met its primary endpoint showing a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference 
between the treatment arms in favour of rituximab. In total 89.5% (34/38) of the patients in the 
rituximab+prednisone arm had CR off prednisone therapy for at least 2 months at month 24. In comparison 
only 27.8% (10/36) of the patients in the prednisone arm experienced CR off prednisone for at least 2 
months at month 24. Looking at CR off prednisone for at least 3 months at month 24 (the original primary 
endpoint) similar results are observed. This is reassuring. 
With regard to the secondary endpoints it was shown that the number of patients who had at least one 
severe/moderate relapse at month 24 was considerable lower in the rituximab arm (23.7% vs. 50.0%). 
Number of patients with CR at month 24 on minimal prednisone treatment was significantly higher in the 
rituximab arm. Total cumulative dose prednisone at month 24 was significantly lower in the rituximab arm. 
Finally, the duration of CRoff prednisone at month 24 in responders was considerable longer in the rituximab 
arm. Overall, all secondary endpoints support the findings in relation to the primary endpoint. 
Considering the QoL results, the sponsor had used Skindex-France and DLQI. No relevant differences are 
observed, however, considering the open-label nature of the study, no major emphasis is put on this results.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The use of rituximab in combination with prednisone was studied in patients newly diagnosed with 
pemphigus vulgaris, but the claimed indication includes patients with established pemphigus vulgaris 
(relapsed setting). The MAH has justified the extrapolation, which includes a PK, PD, efficacy and safety 
discussion, by reasoning as well as by the already provided supporting evidence. There are nevertheless 
uncertainties due to the limitations of the data provided in the established disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206826/2019 
Page 67/71 
 
  
  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the majority of patients in both treatment arms experienced treatment-related AEs, however, there 
are significant differences in favour of the rituximab arm with regards to SAEs, treatment-related SAEs and 
withdrawal of study treatment. Looking at AEs occurring >= 10% of patients it is seen that in most SOCs the 
rituximab+prednisone arm fares better, which is most likely explained by the fact that exposure to 
prednisone was considerable lower in this arm. However, in two SOCs (“injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications” and “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders”) rituximab+prednisone arm fares worse than 
the prednisone arm. This is related to IRR. Following AEs occurred frequently in the rituximab-prednisone 
arm: Infusion Related Reactions (IRR), insomnia, Cushing’s syndrome, arthralgia, asthenia, persistent 
depressive order and alopecia. These are all well-known AEs related to rituximab and clearly reflected in the 
SmPC, except for Cushing’s syndrome, which is related to prednisone. The use of rituximab in combination 
with prednisone did not lead to an increase in infections. This is reassuring. The numbers are small and no 
clear pattern can be observed.

High-dose CS is effective in controlling the disease, but long-term use is associated with severe and serious 
adverse events. Thus, CS sparing treatment options are highly needed. The addition of rituximab to 
prednisone leads to clinically meaningful decrease in prednisone use. This is highly valued from both a 
patient and clinicians perspective. The safety profile of this combination is acceptable, with only IRRs 
standing out. However, IRRs are well-known in relation to the use of rituximab. Clinicians are familiar with 
this AE and it is manageable in the clinical setting.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance is positive in newly diagnosed patients and patient with established disease. 
However there are limitations in the data provided for the patients with established disease.  
The CHMP considered that additional data are necessary to confirm the benefit of Mabthera in the subgroup 
of patients with established disease. The ongoing study in the relapsed setting, study WA29330 (PEMPHIX) 
will provide additional key information on the benefits and risks of Mabthera in these patients. The 
recruitment is completed and the preliminary and final analyses of this study should be provided 
post-approval. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures to address issues related to efficacy and safety:

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV) 
for MabThera; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The MAH 
provided data from a phase III, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label study (Study ML22196) 
evaluating rituximab treatment plus short-term, low dose prednisone treatment compared to long-term, 
standard dose prednisone treatment as first-line treatment in patients with moderate to severe pemphigus. 
The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. Minor corrections are also proposed for the sake of accuracy and 
clarity. An updated RMP (v19.1) was agreed. The annex II is updated to include submission of results of the 
ongoing PEMPHIX clinical study.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet, the 
annex II and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Method of administration 
NEXPOVIO is for oral use. 
NEXPOVIO in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (SVd) should be taken orally at 
approximately the same time once weekly on Day 1 of each week. 
NEXPOVIO in combination with dexamethasone (Sd) should be taken at approximately the same time 
on Days 1 and 3 of each week. 
The tablet should be swallowed whole with water. It should not be crushed, chewed, broken, or 
divided in order to prevent risk of skin irritation from the active substance. It can be taken with or 
without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
For medicinal products administered in combination with selinexor, the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) of these medicinal products must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment, 
including for special warnings and precaution for use and recommended concomitant treatments. 
Recommended concomitant treatments 
Patients should be advised to maintain adequate fluid and caloric intake throughout 
treatment. Intravenous hydration should be considered for patients at risk of dehydration. 
Prophylactic concomitant treatment with a 5-HT3 antagonist and/or other anti-nausea agents 
should be provided prior to and during treatment with NEXPOVIO (see section 4.8). 
Haematology 
Patients should have their complete blood counts (CBC) assessed at baseline, during treatment, and 
as clinically indicated. Monitor more frequently during the first two months of treatment. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenic events (thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) were frequently 
reported in patients receiving selinexor which can be severe (Grade 3/4). Grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia can sometimes lead to clinically significant bleeding and in rare cases may lead 
to potentially fatal haemorrhage (see section 4.8). 
Thrombocytopenia can be managed with dose interruptions, modifications, platelet transfusions, 
and/or other treatments as clinically indicated. Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of bleeding and evaluated promptly. For dose modification guidelines refer to Table 1 
and Table 2 in section 4.2. 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia including severe neutropenia (Grade 3/4) has been reported with selinexor. In a 
few cases concurrent infections occurred in patients with Grade 3/4 neutropenia (see 
section 4.8). 
Patients with neutropenia should be monitored for signs of infection and evaluated promptly. 
Neutropenia can be managed with dose interruptions, modifications, and colony-stimulating 
factors as per medical guidelines. For dose modification guidelines refer to Table 1 and Table 2 
in section 4.2.

Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, which sometimes can be severe and require the use of anti-emetic 
and anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products (see section 4.8). 
Prophylaxis with 5HT3 antagonists and/or other anti-nausea agents should be provided prior to 
and during treatment with selinexor. Fluids with electrolytes should be administered to prevent 
dehydration in patients at risk. 
Nausea/vomiting can be managed by dose interruptions, modifications, and/or initiation of other 
antiemetics medicinal products as clinically indicated. Diarrhoea can be managed with dose 
interruptions, modifications and/or administration of anti-diarrhoea medicinal products. For dose 
modification guidelines refer to Table 1 and Table 2 in section 4.2. 
Weight loss and anorexia 
Selinexor can cause weight loss and anorexia. Patients should have their body weight, nutritional 
status and volume checked at baseline, during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitoring 
should be more frequent during the first two months of treatment. Patients experiencing new or 
worsening decreased appetite and weight may require dose modification, appetite stimulants, and 
nutritional consultations. For dose modification guidelines refer to Table 1 and Table 2 in 
section 4.2. 
Confusional state and dizziness 
Selinexor can cause confusional state and dizziness. Patients should be instructed to avoid 
situations where dizziness or confusional state may be a problem and to not take other medicinal 
products that may cause dizziness or confusional state without adequate medical advice. Patients 
should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery until symptoms resolve (see 
section 4.7). 
Hyponatraemia 
Selinexor can cause hyponatraemia. Patients should have their sodium levels checked at baseline, 
during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitoring should be more frequent during the first 
two months of treatment. Correct sodium levels for concurrent hyperglycaemia (serum 
glucose >150 mg/dL) and high serum paraprotein levels. Hyponatraemia should be treated as per 
medical guidelines (intravenous sodium chloride solution and/or salt tablets), including dietary 
review. 
Patients may require selinexor dose interruption and/or modification. For dose 
modification guidelines refer to Table 1 and Table 2 in section 4.2. 
Cataract 
Selinexor can cause new onset or exacerbation of cataract (see section 4.8). Ophthalmologic 
evaluation may be performed as clinically indicated. Cataract should be treated as per medical 
guidelines, including surgery if warranted. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported in patients receiving therapy with selinexor. 
Patients at a high risk for TLS should be monitored closely. Treat TLS promptly in accordance 
with institutional guidelines. 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant or abstain from 
sexual intercourse while being treated with selinexor and for at least 1 week following the last dose 
of selinexor. 
Women of childbearing potential and male patients of reproductive potential should be advised to 
use effective contraceptive measures or abstain from sexual activity to prevent pregnancy during 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment with selinexor and for at least 1 week following the last dose of selinexor (see 
section 4.6). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 20 mg tablet, that 
is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No dedicated clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted. 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducer might lead to lower exposure of selinexor. 
No clinically significant differences in selinexor pharmacokinetics were observed when co-
administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, clarithromycin (500 mg PO twice daily for 7 days). 
No clinically significant differences in selinexor pharmacokinetics were observed when co-
administered with up to 1000 mg daily dose of paracetamol. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant or abstain from sexual 
intercourse while being treated with selinexor and for at least 1 week following the last dose of 
selinexor. A pregnancy test is recommended for women of childbearing potential prior to initiating 
selinexor treatment. 
Women of childbearing potential and male patients of reproductive potential should be advised to use 
effective contraceptive measures or abstain from sexual activity to prevent pregnancy during treatment 
with selinexor and for at least 1 week following the last dose of selinexor. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of selinexor in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
selinexor can cause foetal harm (see section 5.3). Selinexor is not recommended during pregnancy and 
in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
If the patient becomes pregnant while taking selinexor, selinexor should be immediately discontinued, 
and the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether selinexor or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed 
children cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with selinexor 
and for 1 week after the last dose. 
Fertility 
Based on findings in animals, selinexor may impair fertility in females and males (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Selinexor may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Selinexor can cause 
fatigue, confusional state and dizziness. Patients should be instructed to avoid situations where 
dizziness or confusional state may be a problem and to not take other medicinal products that may 
cause dizziness or confusional state without adequate medical advice. Patients should be advised not to 
drive or operate machines if they experience any of these symptoms.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
Infection was the most common non-haematological toxicity.  
In patients who received SVd, infections were reported in 70% of patients and 28% of patients had 
Grade 3 or 4 infections. Serious infections were reported in 28% of patients with fatal infections 
occurring in 4% of treated patients. Upper respiratory tract infection and pneumonia were the most 
commonly reported infections in 21% and 15% of patients, respectively. Infection led to dose 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discontinuation in 1% of patients, treatment interruption in 48% patients, and a dose reduction in 10% 
of patients. 
In patients who received Sd, infections were reported in 53% of patients. Of these, 22% were Grade 3 
or 4. Upper respiratory tract infection and pneumonia were the most commonly reported infections (in 
15% and 13% of patients, respectively) with 25% of reported infections being serious and fatal 
infections occurring in 3% of treated patients. Infection led to dose discontinuation in 7% of patients, 
treatment interruption in 19% patients, and a dose reduction in 1% of patients. 
Thrombocytopenia 
In patients who received SVd, thrombocytopenia occurred in 62% of patients and 41% of patients had 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was serious in 2% of patients. Of the 41% patients 
with Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 or higher concurrent bleeding events (concurrency 
defined as ±5 days) were reported in 5% of patients. Fatal haemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients 
with thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia led to dose discontinuation in 2% of patients, treatment 
interruption in 35% of patients, and a dose reduction in 33% of patients. 
In patients who received Sd, thrombocytopenia occurred in 75% of patients and 65% of these ADRs 
were Grade 3 or 4. Thrombocytopenia was serious in 5% of patients. Of the 65% patients with Grade 3 
or 4 thrombocytopenia, serious/Grade 3 or higher concurrent bleeding events (concurrency defined as 
±5 days) were reported in 5% of patients. Thrombocytopenia led to dose discontinuation in 3% of 
patients, treatment interruption in 22% of patients, and a dose reduction in 32% of patients. 
Thrombocytopenia can be managed with dose modifications (see section 4.2), supportive care and 
platelet transfusions. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding and evaluated 
promptly (see section 4.4). 
Neutropenia 
In patients who received SVd, neutropenia occurred in 16% of patients and 10% of patients had Grade 
3 or 4 events of neutropenia. Neutropenia was serious in 1% of patients. None of the patients had a 
dose discontinuation due to neutropenia, and neutropenia led to treatment interruption in 9% of 
patients, and a dose reduction in 5% of patients. 
Febrile neutropenia, reported as serious, occurred in one patient (<1%) who received SVd; and was 
Grade 4. Febrile neutropenia led to treatment interruption and dose reduction; no dose discontinuation 
occurred due to febrile neutropenia. Of the 19 patients with Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, serious 
Grade 3 or higher concurrent infections (concurrency defined as ±5 days) were reported in 3 (16%) 
patients. Concurrent Grade 3 or higher infections included lower respiratory tract infection, bronchitis 
and ear infection (1 patient each). 
In patients who received Sd, neutropenia occurred in 36% of patients and 25% of these were Grade 3 
or 4. Neutropenia was serious in 1% of patients. None of the patients had a dose discontinuation due to 
neutropenia, and neutropenia led to treatment interruption in 2% of patients, and a dose reduction in 
6% of patients. 
Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3% of patients who received Sd; all were Grade 3 or 4. Febrile 
neutropenia was reported to be serious in 2% of patients and led to a dose discontinuation, treatment 
interruption, or a dose reduction in less than 1% of patients (each). Of the 53 patients with Grade 3 or 
higher neutropenia, serious/Grade 3 or higher concurrent infections (concurrency defined as ±5 days) 
were reported in 6 (11%) patients. Most commonly reported Grade 3 or higher concurrent infection 
included urinary tract infection (3 patients), and sepsis (2 patients). 
Anaemia 
In patients who received SVd, anaemia occurred in 37% of patients and 16% of patients had Grade 3 
anaemia, no patients had Grade 4 or 5 anaemia. Anaemia was serious in 3% of patients. Anaemia led 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to dose discontinuation in 1% of patients, treatment interruption in 6% of patients, and a dose 
reduction in 3% of patients. 
In patients who received Sd, anaemia occurred in 61% of patients and 44% of these were Grade 3 or 4. 
Anaemia was serious in 3% of patients. Anaemia led to dose discontinuation in <1% of patients, 
treatment interruption in 4% of patients, and a dose reduction in 1% of patients. 
Anaemia can be managed with dose modifications (see section 4.2) and with blood transfusions and/or 
erythropoietin administration as per medical guidelines. For dose modification guidelines refer to 
Table 2 of section 4.2. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
In patients who received SVd, nausea occurred in 50% of patients and 8% of patients had Grade 3 or 4 
nausea. Nausea was serious in 2% of patients. When anti-nausea treatment was administered, the 
median duration of nausea improved by 10 days. Nausea led to dose discontinuation in 3% of patients, 
treatment interruption in 7% of patients, and a dose reduction in 7% of patients. 
Vomiting occurred in 21% of patients who received SVd, and 4% of patients had Grade 3 vomiting. 
No patients had Grade 4 vomiting. Vomiting was serious in 4% of patients. Vomiting led to dose 
discontinuation in 2% of patients, treatment interruption in 3% of patients, and a dose reduction in 3% 
of patients. 
Diarrhoea occurred in 33% of patients who received SVd and 7% of patients had Grade 3 or 4 
diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was serious in 4% of patients. Diarrhoea led to dose discontinuation in 1% of 
patients, treatment interruption in 8% of patients, and a dose reduction in 2% of patients. 
In patients who received Sd, nausea/vomiting occurred in 79% of patients and 10% of these were 
Grade 3 or 4 and was serious in 3% of patients. When anti-nausea treatment was administered, the 
median duration of nausea or vomiting improved by 3 days. Nausea/vomiting led to dose 
discontinuation in 5% of patients, treatment interruption in 8% of patients, and a dose reduction in 5% 
of patients. 
Diarrhoea occurred in 47% of patients who received Sd and 7% were Grade 3 or 4 and diarrhoea was 
serious in 2% of patients. Diarrhoea led to dose discontinuation in 1% of patients, treatment 
interruption in 2% of patients, and a dose reduction in 1% of patients. 
Hyponatraemia 
In patients who received SVd, hyponatraemia occurred in 8% of patients and 5% of patients had Grade 
3 or 4 hyponatremia. Hyponatraemia was serious in <1% of patients. Most cases of hyponatraemia 
were not associated with any symptoms. There were no reports of concurrent seizures. Hyponatraemia 
did not lead to any dose discontinuation, and it led to treatment interruption in <1% of patients, and a 
dose reduction in 1% of patients. 
In patients who received Sd, hyponatraemia occurred in 40% of patients and 24% were Grade 3 or 4. 
Hyponatraemia was serious in 3% of patients. Most cases of hyponatraemia were not associated with 
any symptoms. There were no reports of concurrent seizures. Hyponatraemia did not lead to any dose 
discontinuation, and it led to treatment interruption in 6% of patients, and a dose reduction in 1% of 
patients. 
Cataract 
In patients receiving SVd, the incidence of new onset or worsening cataracts requiring clinical 
intervention was reported in 24% of patients. The median time to new onset of cataract was 233 days. 
The median time for worsening of cataract in patients presenting with cataract at start of selinexor 
therapy was 261 days (SVd). Cataract did not lead to treatment discontinuation, it led to treatment 
interruption in 4% of patients and a dose reduction in 3 % of patients. Cataract should be treated as per 
medical guidelines, including surgery if warranted (see sections 4.4 and 4.2).

Tumour lysis syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred in one (<1%) patient (who received Sd) which was considered 
Grade 3 and serious. Patients at a high risk for TLS should be monitored closely. Treat TLS promptly 
in accordance with institutional guidelines (see section 4.4). 
Elderly population 
Among patients with multiple myeloma who received SVd, 56% were 65 years of age and over, while 
17% were 75 years of age and over. When comparing patients 65 years of age and older to younger 
patients, older patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to an adverse reaction (28% vs 
13%) and higher incidence of serious adverse reactions (57% vs 51%).   
Among patients with multiple myeloma who received Sd, 47% were 65 years of age and over, while 
11% were 75 years of age and over. When comparing patients 75 years of age and older to younger 
patients, older patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to an adverse reaction (52% vs 
25%), higher incidence of serious adverse reactions (74% vs 59%), and higher incidence of fatal 
adverse reactions (22% vs 8%). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In general, overdoses have been associated with similar side effects to those reported for standard 
dosing and have generally been reversible within 1 week. 
Symptoms 
Potential acute symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dehydration and confusion. Potential 
signs include low sodium levels, elevated liver enzymes, and low blood counts. Patients should be 
monitored closely and provided supportive care as appropriate. No fatalities due to overdose have been 
reported to date. 
Management 
In the event of an overdose, monitor the patient for any adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic 
treatment should be provided immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX66 
Mechanism of action 
Selinexor is a reversible covalent selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound that 
specifically blocks exportin 1 (XPO1). XPO1 is the major mediator of the nuclear export of many 
cargo proteins including tumour suppressor proteins (TSPs), growth regulators and mRNAs of growth 
promoting (oncogenic) proteins. XPO1 inhibition by selinexor leads to marked accumulation of TSPs 
in the nucleus, cell cycle arrest, reductions in several oncoproteins such as c-Myc and cyclin D1, and 
apoptosis of cancer cells. The combination of selinexor and dexamethasone and/or bortezomib 
demonstrated synergistic cytotoxic effects in multiple myeloma in vitro and increased anti‐tumour 
activity in murine xenograft multiple myeloma models in vivo, including those resistant to proteasome 
inhibitors. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of multiple doses of selinexor up to 175 mg twice weekly on the QTc interval was evaluated 
in patients with heavily pre-treated haematologic malignancies. Selinexor had no large effect (i.e. no 
greater than 20 ms) on QTc interval at the therapeutic dose level. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Selinexor in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (SVd) for the treatment of patients with 
multiple myeloma 
The efficacy and safety of selinexor in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone were 
evaluated in Study KCP-330-023 (BOSTON), a phase 3, global, randomised, open-label, active-
controlled study, in patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy. 
BOSTON required patients to have measurable myeloma per International Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG) criteria with documented evidence of progressive disease on or after their most recent 
treatment regimen, have previously received treatment with one to three prior different regimens for 
multiple myeloma. Patients who had previously received proteasome inhibitors (alone or as part of a 
combination treatment) were required to have had at least a partial response to the therapy and at least 
a 6-month interval since their last proteasome inhibitor therapy, with no history of discontinuation of 
bortezomib due to Grade 3 or higher toxicity. Patients had to have an ECOG performance score of ≤2, 
adequate hepatic, renal and haematopoietic function. Patients with systemic light-chain amyloidosis, 
active central nervous system myeloma, peripheral neuropathy of Grade 2 or higher, or painful 
neuropathy of Grade 2, plasma cell leukaemia, polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, 
monoclonal gammopathy, or skin changes (POEMS) syndrome were excluded from trial participation.  
The study compared treatment with once weekly selinexor 100 mg (administered orally on Day 1 of 
each week) in combination with twice weekly dexamethasone 20 mg (administered orally on Days 1 
and 2 of each week) and once-weekly bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 (administered subcutaneous on Day 1 of 
weeks 1-4 with week 5 off) [SVd arm] to treatment with twice-weekly bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 
(administered subcutaneous on Days 1, 4, 8, 11) with twice weekly low-dose dexamethasone 20 mg 
(administered orally on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12) of a standard 21-day cycle for the first 8 cycles, 
followed by once weekly subcutaneous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 (administered subcutaneously on Day 1 
of weeks 1-4 with week 5 off) with twice weekly low-dose dexamethasone 20 mg (administered orally 
on Days 1 and 2 of each week) for cycles ≥9 [Vd arm]. 
Treatment continued in both arms until disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. Upon 
confirmed progressive disease (PD), patients in the control arm (Vd) could cross over to receive 
selinexor based therapy in the form of weekly SVd (BOSTON regimen) or weekly Sd (selinexor 
100mg once weekly (Day 1 of each week) and low-dose dexamethasone 20 mg twice weekly (Days 1 
and 2 of each week). 
A total of 402 patients were randomised: 195 to SVd arm and 207 to Vd arm.  
Baseline patient and disease characteristics are described in Table 5.

The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) according to the IMWG Uniform Response 
Criteria for Multiple Myeloma, as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). 
Based on a pre-planned PFS interim analysis, where the boundary for PFS was crossed (median follow 
up of 15.1 months); BOSTON showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the SVd arm 
as compared to the Vd arm; hazard ratio (HR)=0.70 (95% CI: 0.53-0.93; p=0.0075), a median PFS of 
13.9 months (95% CI: 11.7, not reached) and 9.5 months (95% CI: 8.1, 10.8) in the SVd and Vd arms 
respectively. 
There was a statistically significant improvement in overall response rate (ORR): 76.4% in the SVd 
arm vs 62.3% in the Vd arm, p=0.0012.  The ≥ very good partial response rate (≥VGPR rate includes 
stringent complete response [sCR], complete response [CR] and VGPR) was 44.6% in the SVd arm 
compared with 32.4% in the Vd arm. 
The median time to response was 1.4 months in the SVd-treated patients and 1.6 months in the Vd 
treated patients. The median duration of response (DoR), among responding patients, was 20.3 months 
and 12.9 months in the SVd and Vd arms, respectively. 
At the time of the pre-planned PFS interim analysis, 109 overall survival (OS) events had occurred; 
there were 47 and 62 deaths in the SVd and Vd arms respectively (HR=0.84 [95% CI: 0.57, 1.23]). 
Median OS was not reached for the SVd arm and was of 25 months for the Vd arm.

At an updated descriptive analysis with a median follow up of 22.1 months results were consistent 
with the primary analysis. Efficacy results are shown in Table 6 and Figure 1.

Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy, a pre‐specified key secondary endpoint, was lower in the SVd arm 
(21%) compared to the Vd arm (34%); odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.79, p=0.0013], due to the 
lower dose of bortezomib in the SVd arm. 
Selinexor in combination with dexamethasone (Sd) for the treatment of patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma 
Study KPC-330-012 (STORM), a phase 2, multi-centre, single-arm, open-label, study, enrolled 
patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). STORM Part 2 required patients 
to have measurable disease per IMWG criteria, have previously received three or more antimyeloma 
treatment regimens including an alkylating agent, glucocorticoids, bortezomib, carfilzomib, 
lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody; and whose myeloma was 
documented to be refractory to glucocorticoids, a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, 
an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and to the last line of therapy. Patients had to have an ECOG 
performance status score ≤2, adequate hepatic, renal and haematopoietic function. Systemic light chain 
amyloidosis, active central nervous system myeloma, peripheral neuropathy of Grade 3 or higher, or 
painful neuropathy of Grade 2 or higher were exclusion criteria. 
Patients were treated with 80 mg selinexor in combination with 20 mg dexamethasone on Days 1 
and 3 of every week. Treatment continued until disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. 
Among patients enrolled in STORM Part 2 (n=123), eighty-three (83) patients had RRMM that was 
refractory to two proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib), two immunomodulators 
(lenalidomide, pomalidomide) and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (daratumumab). The median 
duration of selinexor treatment in these 83 patients was 9 weeks (range: 1 to 61 weeks). The median 
total dose of selinexor received was 880 mg (range 160 to 6,220 mg), with a median dose of 105 mg 
(range: 22 to 180 mg) received per week. 
The data presented below is from the 83 patients whose disease was refractory to bortezomib (B), 
carfilzomib (C), lenalidomide (L), pomalidomide (P), and daratumumab (D) (penta-refractory).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies 
with selinexor in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of RRMM (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of selinexor peak plasma concentration, Cmax is reached within 4 hours. 
Concomitant administration of a high fat meal (800-1,000 calories with approximately 50% of total 
caloric content of the meal from fat) did not have a clinically significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of selinexor. 
Distribution 
Selinexor is 95.0% bound to human plasma proteins. In a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, 
the apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of selinexor was 133 L in cancer patients. 
Biotransformation 
Selinexor is metabolised by CYP3A4, multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and glutathione 
S- transferases (GSTs). 
Elimination 
Following a single dose of 80 mg selinexor the mean half-life (t1/2) is 6 to 8 hours. In a population PK 
analysis, the apparent total clearance (CL/F) of selinexor was 18.6 L/h in cancer patients. 
22 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Specific populations 
Age, sex and race 
Age (18 to 94 years of age), sex, or race had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
selinexor. 
In the population PK dataset, age and race were not identified as a significant covariate, gender was 
identified as a significant covariate. 
Renal impairment 
The degree of renal impairment was determined by creatinine clearance as estimated by the Cockcroft-
Gault equation. Results from population PK analyses of patients with normal (n=283, CLcr: ≥90 
mL/min), mild (n=309, CLcr: 60 to 89 mL/min), moderate (n=185, CLcr: 30 to 59 mL/min) or severe 
(n=13, CLcr: 15 to 29 mL/min) renal dysfunction indicated that creatinine clearance had no impact on 
the PK of NEXPOVIO. Therefore, mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment is not expected to alter 
selinexor PK, and no adjustments in the dose of selinexor are required in patients with renal 
dysfunction. 
Hepatic impairment 
Population PK analysis indicated that mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin >1-1.5 x ULN or AST> 
ULN, but bilirubin ≤ ULN, n=119) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of selinexor. Similar 
finding was observed in a small number of patients with moderate (bilirubin >1.5-3 x ULN; any AST, 
n=10) and severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin >3 x ULN; any AST, n=3). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated-dose Toxicity 
Findings in the repeat dose 13-week rat study were decrements in body weight gain and food 
consumption, and haematopoietic/lymphoid hypoplasia, and male/female reproductive organ effects. 
In the 13-week monkey study, the treatment-related effects observed included body weight loss, 
gastrointestinal effects, and lymphoid/haematologic depletion. Gastrointestinal toxicities, including 
anorexia, decrements in body weight gain and reduced food consumption were noted to be CNS- 
mediated. No safety margin for these toxicities could be established. 
Genotoxicity 
Selinexor was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay. Selinexor was not clastogenic in 
either the in vitro cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes or in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with selinexor. 
Toxicity to Reproduction and Development 
Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with selinexor. In repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies, selinexor was administered for up to 13 weeks in rats and monkeys. Reduced sperm, 
spermatids, and germ cells in epididymides and testes were observed in rats, decreased ovarian 
follicles were also observed in rats, and single cell necrosis of testes was observed in monkeys. These 
findings were observed at systemic exposures approximately 0.11, 0.28, and 0.53 times, respectively, 
the exposure (AUClast) in humans at the recommended human dose of 80 mg. Developmental effects 
were seen with daily exposure in pregnant rats at systemic exposures below the exposure (AUClast) in 
humans at the recommended human dose of 80 mg. 
Other Toxicities 
A guinea pig sensitisation assay showed that selinexor at 25% induced a mild Grade II dermal contact 
hypersensitivity response at 24 and 48 hours.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What NEXPOVIO is and what it is used for  
NEXPOVIO contains the active substance selinexor. Selinexor is a cancer medicine known as an 
XPO1 inhibitor. It blocks the action of a substance called XPO1 that transports proteins from the cell 
nucleus into the cell cytoplasm. Some cell proteins must be in the nucleus in order to function 
properly. 
By blocking XPO1 function, selinexor prevents the exit of certain proteins out of the nucleus, and 
interfering with the continued growth of cancer cells, and leading to the death of cancer cells. 
What NEXPOVIO is used for 
NEXPOVIO is used to treat adult patients with multiple myeloma that has come back after treatment. 
NEXPOVIO is used 
• 
together with two other medicines called bortezomib and dexamethasone in people who had at 
least one other prior treatment. 
OR 
• 
together with dexamethasone in patients who have received at least four previous types of 
myeloma treatment and whose disease cannot be controlled with prior medicines used to treat 
multiple myeloma. 
Multiple myeloma is a cancer which affects a type of blood cell called the plasma cell. A plasma cell 
normally produces proteins to fight infections. People with multiple myeloma have cancerous plasma 
cells, also called myeloma cells, which can damage bones and kidneys and increase the risk of 
infection. Treatment with NEXPOVIO kills myeloma cells and reduces symptoms of the disease. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take NEXPOVIO 
Do not take NEXPOVIO 
If you are allergic to selinexor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking NEXPOVIO and during treatment if you: 
•  have or have had bleeding problems. 
•  have had a recent infection or get an infection. 
•  have nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. 
• 
lose your appetite or lose weight. 
•  have confusion and dizziness. 
•  have a decrease in your blood sodium levels (hyponatraemia). 
have a new or worsening cataract. 
Your doctor will examine you and you will be monitored closely during treatment. Before starting 
NEXPOVIO and during treatment, you will have blood tests to check that you have enough blood 
cells. 
Children and adolescents 
NEXPOVIO should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years. 
Other medicines and NEXPOVIO 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy 
A pregnancy test is recommended before NEXPOVIO treatment for women able to have children. 
Do not use NEXPOVIO during pregnancy as it can harm the unborn child. Women who become 
pregnant while taking NEXPOVIO must immediately stop treatment and inform the doctor. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with NEXPOVIO or 1 week after the last dose, as it is unknown 
whether selinexor or its metabolites are excreted in human milk and cause harm to the breast-fed 
children. 
Fertility 
NEXPOVIO may impair fertility in females and males. 
Contraception 
Women who can become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 
week after the last dose. 
Men are recommended to use effective contraceptive measures or avoid sexual intercourse with 
women able to have children during treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose. 
Driving and using machines 
NEXPOVIO can cause fatigue, confusion and dizziness. Do not drive or use machines if you get such 
a reaction while being treated with this medicine. 
NEXPOVIO contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 20 mg tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  How to take NEXPOVIO 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is: 
• 
 when used together with bortezomib and dexamethasone: 100 mg (5 tablets) once daily, on day 1 
of each week, or as directed by your doctor. 
•  when used with dexamethasone: 80 mg (4 tablets) once daily, on days 1 and 3 of each week, or as 
directed by your doctor. 
Your doctor may alter your dose if side effects occur. 
It is important to take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you to avoid dosing errors. 
Method of use 
Swallow NEXPOVIO tablets whole with a glassful of water, either with food or between meals. Do 
not chew, crush, divide or break the tablets in order to prevent risk of skin irritation from the active 
substance. 
Duration of use 
Your doctor will let you know the duration of treatment based on how you are responding to treatment 
and side effects. 
If you take more NEXPOVIO than you should 
Call your doctor or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. Take your box of 
NEXPOVIO tablets with you. 
If you forget to take NEXPOVIO 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Also, do not take an extra dose if you vomit 
after taking NEXPOVIO. Take your next dose when scheduled. 
If you stop taking NEXPOVIO 
Do not stop taking or change your dose of NEXPOVIO without your doctor’s approval. However, if 
you become pregnant while taking NEXPOVIO, you must immediately stop treatment and inform 
your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you notice any of the following side effects. 
NEXPOVIO may cause the following serious side effects: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
• 
reduced number of blood platelets 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests before you start taking NEXPOVIO, and as needed during 
and after treatment. These tests will be more frequent during the first two months of treatment to 
monitor your blood platelet counts. Your doctor may stop treatment or adjust the dose based on 
your platelet counts. Tell your doctor immediately if you have signs of reduced number of blood 
platelets such as: 
- 
easy or excessive bruising 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
skin changes that appear as a rash of pinpoint-sized reddish-purple spots 
prolonged bleeding from cuts 
bleeding from your gums or nose 
blood in your urine or stools 
- 
- 
- 
- 
reduced number of red and white blood cells, including neutrophils and lymphocytes. 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests to monitor your red and white blood cell counts before you 
start taking NEXPOVIO and as needed during and after treatment. These tests will be more 
frequent during the first two months of treatment. Your doctor may stop treatment or adjust the 
dose based on your blood cell counts or may treat you with other medicines to increase cell 
counts. Tell your doctor immediately if you have signs of reduced neutrophils such as a fever. 
fatigue 
Inform your doctor if you experience new or worsening fatigue. Your doctor may adjust the dose 
in case of persistent or worsening fatigue. 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea 
Inform your doctor immediately if you develop nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. Your doctor may 
adjust the dose or stop treatment based on the severity of your symptoms. In addition, your 
doctor may prescribe you medicines to take before or during NEXPOVIO treatment to prevent 
and treat nausea and/or vomiting and/or diarrhoea. 
decreased appetite and/or weight 
Your doctor will weigh you before you start taking NEXPOVIO and as needed during and after 
treatment. This will be more frequent during the first two months of treatment. Tell your doctor 
if you lose your appetite and if you lose weight. Your doctor may adjust the dose in case of 
reduced appetite and weight and/or prescribe medicines to increase your appetite. Maintain 
adequate fluid and caloric intake throughout your treatment. 
reduced sodium level 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests to check your sodium level before you start taking 
NEXPOVIO, and as necessary during and after treatment. These tests will be more frequent 
during the first two months of treatment. Your doctor may adjust the dose and/or prescribe salt 
tablets or fluids based on your sodium level. 
confusional state and dizziness 
Inform your doctor if you experience confusion. Avoid situations where dizziness or confusional 
state may be a problem and do not take other medications that may cause dizziness or 
confusional state without talking to your doctor. Do not drive or operate machines if you 
experience any confusion or dizziness until it resolves. Your doctor may adjust the dose to 
reduce these symptoms. 
cataract 
Inform your doctor if you experience symptoms of cataract such as double vision, sensitivity to 
light or glare. If you notice changes with your vision, your doctor may request an eye 
examination by an eye specialist (an ophthalmologist) and you may need eye surgery to remove 
the cataract and restore your vision.

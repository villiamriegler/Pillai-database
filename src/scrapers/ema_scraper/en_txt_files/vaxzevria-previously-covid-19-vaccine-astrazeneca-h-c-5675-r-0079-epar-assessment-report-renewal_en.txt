1.  Background information on the annual renewal 
The European Commission issued on 29 January 2021, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for 
Vaxzevria This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete 
ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific 
Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA. 
A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. 
Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH AstraZeneca AB, submitted to the Agency on 22 July 2022 an 
application for renewal of the conditional MA for Vaxzevria. The expiry date of the MA is 29 January 
2023. 
The period covered by this annual renewal is 1 June 2021 to 31 May 2022.

2.2.  Outstanding Specific Obligations – status report for period covered 
At the time of this annual renewal, the list of pending SOBs is indicated in the following Table 2 
Table 2 Summary table of the Specific obligations (SOBs) and other conditions

Quality 
Two Specific Obligations were raised at the time of the conditional authorization. The due date 
established for Specific Obligations at the time of the conditional authorization was December 2021 
with interim monthly updates beginning February 2021, for SO1 (SO13), and June 2022 with interim 
monthly updates beginning February 2021, for SO2 (SO14). Some points of these SO have been 
updated after the assessment of Type IB variations in the context of approved PAMCs to include 
additional manufacturing sites. 
During the period covered from the conditional authorization to the first annual renewal, SOB 1 c, e 
and f and RECs 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35 and 53 and 
legally binding LEG002 were fulfilled.  
During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on Quality Specific Obligations (SOB) and 
Recommendations (REC) have been monthly provided. Specific Obligation SO13 and quality related 
recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 
27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 69 and 71 are 
fulfilled. SO14 is still ongoing.  
By variation II-74 (June 2022), Annex IIE was updated to remove the specific obligation relating to 
provision of process validation data for the active substance and finished product (SO13-1a and SO13-
1b) which has been fulfilled, and to change the date of the specific obligation relating to the provision 
of additional information on stability of the active substance and finished product (and review the 
finished product specifications following further manufacturing experience) from June 2022 to January 
2023 (SO14). The change in date was agreed as stability studies were ongoing and further data from 
these studies are expected to be submitted in due course. This remaining quality SOB (SOB 014) may 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 6/21 
 
 
 
 
be reclassified as a REC. This specific obligation regarding stability data was raised because, at the 
time of the conditional authorisation, in order to ensure consistent product quality, there was a need 
for additional stability data from all manufacturing sites to support the shelf life granted, both for the 
active substance and for the finished product.  The Company has been providing stability data in 
monthly updates indicating that product stability is guaranteed for the approved shelf life.   
The remaining quality SOB (SOB 014) may be reclassified as a REC. 
Non-clinical 
There were no non-clinical SOBs to be addressed for this annual renewal. 
Clinical 
During the period covered by this renewal the primary analysis for SOB 019 and SOB 020 were 
submitted in procedures EMA/H/C/005675/II/0002 and EMA/H/C/005675/II/0026, respectively. Both 
aspects of the respective SOBs are considered fulfilled. It is noted that neither these two SOBs nor the 
rest of clinical SOBs (SOB15, SOB16, SOB17, and SOB18) have been fully fulfilled during the time 
period covered by this annual renewal. 
SOBs 015, SOB 016, SOB 017 and SOB 018 are currently ongoing, where final CSR submission is due 
on 31 December 2022. It is noted that in the list of SOBs adopted at the time of the MA, final clinical 
study reports for SOB 015, SOB 016, SOB 017, SOB 018 and for the final analysis from the pooled 
pivotal studies were due for 31 December 2022. However, following the request from the MAH 
(EMA/H/C/005675/IB/0069), the due dates were amended to 31 December 2022.  
Overall, it is agreed with the MAH that the data collected as part of the specific obligations for 
Vaxzevria during the period covered by this renewal support its positive benefit-risk balance for the 
approved indication. 
Currently the only outstanding information in relation to the original SOBs is the final CSR from 
individual studies COV001, COV002, COV003, COV005, and D8110C00001, as well as the final analysis 
from the pooled pivotal studies (efficacy analysis from trials COV002 and COV003, and a pooled safety 
analysis based on all four trials COV001, COV002, COV003, and COV005).  
It is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in the final CSRs will bring substantial additional 
confirmatory evidence impacting the benefit-risk profile of Vaxzevria in its current indication. Even 
tough the MAH has requested a renewal of the current conditional marketing authorization, it is 
considered that the current conditional marketing authorization could be converted into a standard 
marketing authorization. The remaining clinical SOBs may therefore be reclassified as Category 3 
studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be submitted at the agreed due date as supportive data.   
As part of this annual renewal, the CHMP is of the opinion that the SOBs 015, 016, 017, 018, 019 and 
029 can therefore be deleted from Annex II. The RMP will be updated accordingly at the next 
regulatory opportunity.  
2.3.  Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations 
Quality: 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data regarding the quality SOB 013 and SOB 
014 have been submitted which were submitted in compliance with the deadlines. SOB 013 was 
considered fulfilled and SOB 014 had a deadline which was accepted to be postponed to January 2023, 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 7/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
however, it may be reclassified as a REC. The SOBs can therefore be deleted from Annex II. 
Non-clinical: 
There were no non-clinical SOBs to be addressed for this annual renewal. 
Legally Binding measures (LEG) and Recommendations (REC) concerning the non-clinical assessment 
have been all adequately resolved. 
Clinical: 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data regarding SOBs have emerged. The new 
data emerged are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and are compliant in terms of 
acceptability of data submitted. Moreover, these new data do not modify the current benefit-risk 
balance of the vaccine in the approved indication. 
Currently the only pending information in relation to the original SOBs is the final CSR from individual 
studies COV001, COV002, COV003, COV005, and D8110C00001, as well as the final analysis from the 
pooled pivotal studies (efficacy analysis from trials COV002 and COV003, and a pooled safety analysis 
based on all four trials COV001, COV002, COV003, and COV005).  However, it is not expected that the 
remaining outstanding data in the final CSRs will bring substantial additional confirmatory evidence 
impacting the benefit-risk profile of Vaxzevria in its current indication.  It is considered that the current 
conditional approval should be converted into a standard marketing authorization. The remaining 
clinical SOBs may therefore be reclassified as Category 3 studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be 
submitted at the agreed due date as supportive data.   
As part of this annual renewal, the CHMP is of the opinion that the SOBs 015, 016, 017, 018, 019 and 
029 can therefore be deleted from Annex II. The RMP will be updated accordingly at the next 
regulatory opportunity. 
3.  Additional scientific data provided relevant for the 
assessment of the benefit/risk balance 
3.1.  Quality 
Please see above rationale for pending Quality REC. 
3.2.  Non-clinical 
Non-clinical ANX-044, LEG-004 and RECS 060, 061, 062 and 063 have been fulfilled during the period 
covered by this annual renewal (EMEA/H/C/005675/II/17/G).  Updated information was included in 
sections 4.6 and 5.3 of SmPC following assessment and the ANX-044 study was recommended to be 
deleted from Annex II.  
As part of the type II variation EMEA/H/C/005675/II/31, the MAH submitted the final report for study 
MS1222-0002 which fulfils the Annex II obligation (ANX-045) as well as the post-authorisation 
measure (PAM- MEA-082) “In Vitro expression of Spike protein” as detailed under additional 
pharmacovigilance activities in the EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Vaxzevria. As a result, Annex 
II of the product information was updated to remove ANX-045.  
Moreover, the MAH provided two additional studies linked to support the investigation on the platelet 
activation: the final study report for MS1222-0001 “Computational Prediction of Spike Protein 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 8/21 
 
 
 
Interaction with Platelet Factor 4 (PF4)” and the study report for 520447 "Investigative Vaccine Study 
in the Mouse" to evaluate spike protein levels and haematology parameters. 
There are no outstanding issues regarding the non-clinical assessment. 
3.3.  Clinical efficacy 
The new information regarding clinical efficacy that emerged during the period covered by this annual 
renewal is as follows: 
a) One clinical trial (D8111C00002) was completed. This trial is a Phase I/II Randomised, Double-blind, 
Placebo-controlled Multicentre Study in Participants Aged 18 Years or Older to Determine the Safety 
and Immunogenicity of Vaxzevria, a Non-replicating ChAdOx1 Vector Vaccine, for the Prevention of 
COVID-19: Phase I/II. This clinical trial was carried out in Japan and recruited in total 256 participants 
and it is noted that detailed report on this study has not been submitted to CHMP. Nonetheless, the 
MAH indicates that AZD1222 administered in 2 intramuscular (IM) injections was generally well-
tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile in Japanese adult participants across all age groups (18 
to 55 years, 56 to 69 years, and ≥ 70 years), and the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) 
reported between Day 58 and Day 365, in addition to the unsolicited adverse events (AEs) collected up 
to Day 57, was low. The MAH also indicates that the immunogenicity data collected from this trial 
suggest that AZD1222 elicits strong early immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in the Japanese 
adult population across all the age groups; however, waning of immune responses, with neutralizing 
antibodies below the lower limit of quantification, was observed in a large proportion of participants by 
Day 365.  
b) Additional information (safety and efficacy data) from study D8110C00001 was under evaluation in 
procedure EMA/H/C/005675/II/0075 at the time of the submission of this renewal. Primary analysis 
results for study D8110C00001 were provided in a previous submission (EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0026) 
based on a data cut off (DCO) date of 05 March 2021. The new submitted data in this application are 
the results of the 6-month follow-up analysis and are based on a DCO date of 30 July 2021.  The new 
efficacy data supports maintenance of efficacy for at least 6-months: whereas the primary efficacy 
analysis showed a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 74.0%, with a lower bound of the 95% CI of 65.3%, the 
new data provide an estimate of VE of 66.98%. with a lower bound of the 95% CI of 58.87%. The 
same immunogenicity conclusions reached at the time primary analysis are made upon assessing the 
new data. From the safety point of view, the data reported from the 6-months follow-up did not show 
new safety concerns for AZD1222.  This variation concluded positively on 15 September 2022.  
c) Clinical trial D7220C00001 is an ongoing Phase II/III, partially double-blinded, randomised, 
multinational, active controlled study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of AZD2816 (a 
modified AZD1222 vaccine targeted against the Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2) and AZD1222 (original 
vaccine expressing the Wuhan strain) as a 1-dose booster vaccination in previously vaccinated adult 
participants (either with AZD1222 or an mRNA vaccine) and also as a 2-dose primary vaccination 
schemes in previously unvaccinated adult participants. Based on the results from Clinical trial, the 
SmPC was updated to incorporate the use of AZD1222 as a homologous or heterologous (on subjects 
that received a primary’s series of an mRNA vaccine) booster (EMA/H/C/005675/II/0052). 
The new data from these studies demonstrated that the benefit risk balance of Vaxzevria remains 
unchanged.

3.4.  Clinical safety 
The MAH submitted the Addendum to the Clinical Overview (ACO), covering the period between 29 
January 2021 and 31 May 2022. 
3.4.1.  Actions taken for safety reason 
In April 2021, a contraindication for patients who have experienced major venous and/or arterial 
thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia following vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine 
was added to the Company Core Data Sheet (CDS). Information was also added to Section 4.4 
(Special warnings and special precautions for use) to inform health care professionals on this condition. 
In November 2021, AstraZeneca updated the Vaxzevria CDS Section 4.4 (Warnings and precautions) 
to add new text regarding very rare events of cerebrovascular sinus thrombosis (CVST) to inform 
healthcare professionals that CVST and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) require a 
different treatment approach and recommend that applicable guidance be consulted. Subsequently, 
AstraZeneca added CVST without thrombocytopenia as an Important potential risk in the Core risk 
management plan (RMP). 
In response to impositions received from European Medicines Agency (EMA), Medicines and Healthcare 
Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and other health authorities, local market product information 
documents have been updated with: 
•  A contraindication for individuals with a known history of Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS) and 
information that patients with an acute episode of CLS following vaccination require prompt 
recognition and treatment (June 2021) (EMA/H/C/005675/IAIN/0029) 
• 
Information stating that if an individual has a history of a thrombocytopenic disorder, such as 
immune thrombocytopenia, the risk of developing low platelet levels should be considered before 
administering the vaccine and platelet monitoring is recommended after vaccination 
(EMEA/H/C/005675/IAIN/0048- October 2021). Also, Thrombocytopenia, including immune 
thrombocytopenia was added as an Important identified risk in the EU RMP for VAXZEVRIA as 
imposition.  
• 
Information for healthcare professionals to be alert of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) 
(EMA/H/C/005675/IB/034-July 2021) and transverse myelitis (TM) (EMA/H/C/005675/IB0067- 
February 2022) signs and symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate 
supportive care and treatment, and to rule out other causes. In addition, GBS was added as an 
Important identified Risk in the EU RMP for Vaxzevria as imposition. 
Following Health Authority Impositions Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) letters 
were disseminated providing information on 
Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia (April and June 2021) 
•  Risk of thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders (March 2021) 
• 
•  Contraindication in individuals with previous capillary leak syndrome (June 2021) 
•  Risk of thrombocytopenia (including immune thrombocytopenia) with or without associated 
bleeding (October 2021) 
In the context of the recent PSUSA (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010912/202112) tinnitus, hypoaesthesia and 
paraesthesia have been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 10/21 
 
 
 
3.4.2.  Completed, ongoing and planned Clinical Studies 
During the reporting period, 11 AstraZeneca or Oxford sponsored clinical trials were ongoing and 1 was 
completed. However, no additional efficacy or safety issues were identified to affect Benefit-Risk 
assessment till DLP 31 May 2022. 
3.4.3.   Non-interventional studies 
No relevant safety information or information with potential impact on the benefit-risk or risk 
evaluations arose from AstraZeneca-sponsored non-interventional studies of Vaxzevria during the 
reporting period. Ongoing non-interventional studies did not yet collect sufficient data for concluding 
on an impact on the benefit risk of Vaxzevria.   
Post authorisation safety studies (PASS) are currently ongoing including a pregnancy registry (C-VIPER 
consortium) and a study to evaluate the association between Vaxzevria and safety concerns of interest 
using secondary health data sources. Data made available are still preliminary.   
Of note that the study on Enhanced active surveillance of adults in the UK was removed from the EU-
RMP due to problems of recruitment. Preliminary results did not raise safety signal but the number of 
enrolees was limited.  
Several other studies categories in the pharmacovigilance plan as category 1, category 2 and category 
3 studies are ongoing as detailed in the RMP.  
3.5.  Safety signals 
The MAH did not discuss safety signals issued during the reporting period. These signals were 
discussed through periodic safety update reports, summary safety reports (SSRs) or dedicated 
procedures.  
3.5.1.  Literature 
Although a number of literature articles reviewed during the reporting period, no literature articles with 
new and significant safety findings relevant to Vaxzevria were identified. This is based on review of 
literature data as available during the reporting period as available from PBRER for periods 29 
December 2020 to 28 June 2021 and 29 June 2021 to 28 December 2021 with additional literature 
review conducted post-Data Lock Point (DLP) of the last PSUR from 29 December 2021 till the DLP of 
this ACO (31 May 2022).  
Publications of interest were discussed in the PSURs and in the SSRs. No new safety information from 
the literature was identified during the reporting period that could affect the benefit risk assessment.  
Overall, literature supported increased risks of thrombotic events after vaccination, thrombocytopenia 
which are recognised adverse drug reactions in the product information. Literature findings were also 
helpful for the assessment of safety signals such as, most recently, Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
(recognised ADR in product information) or Corneal Graft Rejection (EPITT no: 19791, assessment 
ongoing at the time of the submission of this renewal). On 1st September 2022, PRAC agreed that a 
causal association between Vaxzevria and Corneal Graft rejection could not be established at this 
stage.  
An epidemiological study based on data from French national databases (Epi-Phare; Botton et al 2022) 
suggested a slightly increased risk of pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction following

vaccination with Vaxzevria. A cumulative review of the cases was under assessment at the end of the 
reporting period (May 2022) through a dedicated procedure (LEG 103). The assessment concluded that 
these safety endpoints should continue to be monitored but did not impact the benefit-risk balance of 
the vaccine. 
3.5.2.  Late breaking information  
The evaluation of the validated signal of Tinnitus and based on the evaluation of currently available 
information from various sources, AstraZeneca considers that there is a reasonable possibility of a 
causal association between Vaxzevria and tinnitus, CDS (Version 19, dated 01 July 2022) Section 4.8 
was updated to include ‘tinnitus’ as ADR. Tinnitus was included in Section 4.8 of the EU SmPC with the 
frequency of ‘Uncommon’ via procedure PSUSA/00010912/202112.  
3.6.  Pharmacovigilance inspections 
The MAH did not provide any information on Pharmacovigilance inspections during the reporting 
period.  
In October 2021, the Swedish Medical Product Agency (MPA) supervised a pharmacovigilance 
inspection (EMA/INS/PhV/312755/2021 – INS/PHV/2021/006). The inspection revealed no critical 
findings, 5 major and 2 minor findings. The major findings were related to the Safety Summary 
Reports, the handling of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) and adverse reactions, signal 
management, the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) testing and the pharmacovigilance training. The 
minor findings were related to the content of the Pharmacovigilance System Master File (PSMF) and 
the reconciliation between the complaint database and the safety database. 
The MAH was recommended to evaluate their ability to process ICSRs in due time and with an 
appropriate assessment. The MAH was also strongly recommended to follow up the quality related to 
the pharmacovigilance processes and procedures. Regarding case reports in clinical studies, the MAH 
was recommended to use multiple categories for cases causality assessment (such as WHO-UCM 
system for standardized case causality assessment). 
In response to this inspection, the MAH proposed corrective and preventative actions, that appear to 
adequately address the issues identified. MPA will further review the implementation and effectiveness 
of these actions.  
The Inspectors concluded that special attention should be given to the quality of the handling of ICSRs 
considering the possible impact on the signal detection activities and safety summary reports. Other 
Inspections conducted in 2021 were discussed in the former renewal assessment. No inspection was 
conducted in 2022.  
3.7.  Discussion 
The safety information collected since the previous renewal procedure (covering the period 29 January 
to 31 May 2021) does not modify the benefit risk profile of the vaccine. However, the risks of SARS-
COV-2 infection and the context of treatment and prevention of the disease have evolved.  
TTS and CVST, the key risks identified for Vaxzevria, are greater risks in young adults who benefit less 
from vaccination. This observation led to question the benefit risk balance in the younger population 
and for several EU Member States to restrict the use of the vaccine, especially after more alternative 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 12/21 
 
 
 
vaccines were made available.  Review of ongoing clinical trial data and post-marketing experience did 
not alter the overall positive benefit-risk profile of Vaxzevria that supported the last approval. 
4.  Risk management plan 
No updated version of the RMP was submitted within this renewal procedure. The RMP version 5 has 
been submitted within procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/075 in order to:  
•  Update the table of safety concern: Reclassify ‘anaphylaxis’ as non-important safety concern;  
•  Update information on important identified, potential risks and missing information;  
•  Update the list of AESI; 
•  Update the pharmacovigilance plan (milestone, completed studies, etc.) 
The assessment of procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/075 was ongoing at the time of the submission of 
this renewal application.

5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The Annexes I, II and III were amended to reflect the granting of a marketing authorisation not 
subject to Specific Obligations for Vaxzevria. The MAH took the opportunity to implement other minor 
administrative updates (see Attachment 1). 
6.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance 
6.1.  Specific Obligations (SOBs) 
Compliance of SOB data submitted 
During the period covered by this annual renewal data on the SOBs have been submitted that overall 
are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and are compliant in terms of acceptability of data 
submitted. 
Quality 
Two Specific Obligations were raised at the time of the conditional authorization. The due date 
established for Specific Obligations at the time of the conditional authorization was December 2021 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 14/21 
 
 
 
 
 
with interim monthly updates beginning February 2021, for SO1 (SO13), and June 2022 with interim 
monthly updates beginning February 2021, for SO2 (SO14). Some points of these SO have been 
updated after the assessment of Type IB variations in the context of approved PAMCs to include 
additional manufacturing sites. 
During the period covered from the conditional authorization to the first annual renewal, SO1 c, e and f 
and RECs 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35 and 53 and 
legally binding LEG002 were fulfilled.  
During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on Quality Specific Obligations (SO) and 
Recommendations (REC) have been monthly provided. Specific Obligation SO13 and quality related 
recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 
27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 69 and 71 are 
fulfilled. SO14 is still ongoing.  
By variation II-74 (June 2022), Annex IIE was updated to remove the specific obligation relating to 
provision of process validation data for the active substance and finished product (SO13-1a and SO13-
1b) which has been fulfilled, and to change the date of the specific obligation relating to the provision 
of additional information on stability of the active substance and finished product (and review the 
finished product specifications following further manufacturing experience) from June 2022 to January 
2023 (SO14). The change in date was agreed as stability studies were ongoing and further data from 
these studies are expected to be submitted in due course. This remaining quality SOB (SOB 014) may 
be reclassified as a REC. This specific obligation regarding stability data was raised because, at the 
time of the conditional authorisation, in order to ensure consistent product quality, there was a need 
for additional stability data from all manufacturing sites to support the shelf life granted, both for the 
active substance and for the finished product.  The Company has been providing stability data in 
monthly updates indicating that product stability is guaranteed for the approved shelf life.   
SO13-1a: The applicant should provide specific dates for data completion for each site as follows: for 
current pre-process performance qualification (PPQ) and PPQ active substance (AS) batches, additional 
test release and characterisation data as well as new results for the degradation stability studies 
should be completed for Catalent Maryland, MD, US; Oxford Biomedica, Oxford, UK and Henogen S.A., 
Seneffe, BE to confirm that the process is properly validated. 
SO13-1b: The applicant should provide specific dates for data completion for each site as follows, 
including for PPQ batches to be manufactured: complete final PPQ validation reports and comparability 
analysis (for three AS batches) must be performed for Henogen, Rue de la Marlette, Seneffe, BE; 
Catalent, 7555 Harmans Road, Maryland, USA; Oxford Biomedica, Alec Issigonis Way, Oxford, UK; 
Halix, Tinbergenweg 1 2333 BB, Leiden, NL; SK Bioscience Co Limited, 150, Saneopdanji-gil, Pungsan-
eup, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea; and WuXi Biologics Co., Ltd, 108 Meiliang 
Road, Mashan, Binhu District, WuXi, Jiangsu 214092, China active substance manufacturing sites. 
Complete batch release and analytical comparability data (including degradation trend comparison) for 
PPQ batches should be presented to confirm that the process is properly validated and to demonstrate 
that the commercial AS is representative of the material used in clinical trials. 
SO13 a and b were already removed from Annex II by variation II-74 (June 2022). 
Non-clinical 
There were no non-clinical SOBs to be addressed for this annual renewal. Non-clinical ANX, LEGs and 
RECs have been fulfilled during the period covered by this annual renewal (assessed in variation 
EMEA/H/C/005675/II/17/G and EMEA/H/C/005675/II/31). There are no outstanding issues regarding 
the non-clinical assessment.   
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 15/21 
 
 
 
Clinical 
During the period covered by this renewal the primary analysis for SOB 019 and SOB 020 were 
submitted in procedures EMA/H/C/005675/II/0002 and EMA/H/C/005675/II/0026, respectively. Both 
aspects of the respective SOBs are considered fulfilled. It is noted that neither these two SOBs nor the 
rest of clinical SOBs (SOB15, SOB16, SOB17, and SOB18) have been fully fulfilled during the time 
period covered by this annual renewal. 
SOBs 015, SOB 016, SOB 017 and SOB 018 are currently ongoing, where final CSR submission is due 
on 31 December 2022. It is noted that in the list of SOBs adopted at the time of the MA, final clinical 
study reports for SOB 015, SOB 016, SOB 017, SOB 018 and for the final analysis from the pooled 
pivotal studies were due for 31 December 2022. However, following the request from the MAH 
(EMA/H/C/005675/IB/0069), the due dates were ammended to 31 December 2022.  
Overall, it is agreed with the MAH that the data collected as part of the specific obligations for 
Vaxzevria during the period covered by this renewal support its positive benefit-risk balance for the 
approved indication. 
Currently the only outstanding information in relation to the original SOBs is the final CSR from 
individual studies COV001, COV002, COV003, COV005, and D8110C00001, as well as the final analysis 
from the pooled pivotal studies (efficacy analysis from trials COV002 and COV003, and a pooled safety 
analysis based on all four trials COV001, COV002, COV003, and COV005). The MAH has asked for 
renewal of the current CMA.  
It is not expected that the remaining outstanding data in the final CSRs will bring substantial additional 
confirmatory evidence impacting the benefit-risk profile of Vaxzevria in its current indication.  It is 
considered that the current conditional marketing authorization could be converted into a standard 
marketing authorization. The remaining clinical SOBs may therefore be reclassified as Category 3 
studies in the RMP, with the final CSRs to be submitted at the agreed due date as supportive data.   
As part of this annual renewal, the CHMP is of the opinion that the SOBs 015, 016, 017, 018, 019 and 
029 can therefore be deleted from Annex II. The RMP will be updated accordingly at the next 
regulatory opportunity.  
Updated list of specific obligations (SOBs) 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the comprehensive existing data package for this vaccine warrants 
conversion of the current conditional approval into a full marketing authorisation. Nevertheless, as 
depicted in the below table, the final study reports for ongoing clinical trials shall be submitted by the 
MAH according to the agreed due dates.

updates 
beginning 
February 2021 
The data available concerning Vaxzevria is considered comprehensive; therefore, the CHMP is of the 
view that the six remaining clinical Specific Obligations may be reclassified as category 3 studies in the 
RMP at the next regulatory opportunity and final CSRs should be submitted as supportive data. It is 
proposed to re-classify quality SOB 014 from a specific obligation to a recommendation. In addition, it 
is considered that it is not necessary to receive interim monthly updates, a single report on the due 
date being sufficient.  
6.2.  Benefit-risk Balance 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do 
not have an impact on the benefit-risk of Vaxzevria in the approved indication. 
The data collected as part of the specific obligation(s) for Vaxzevria during the period covered by this 
annual renewal supported its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved indication(s). 
Favourable effects 
The favourable effects were demonstrated in the initial marketing authorisation for individuals 18 years 
of age and older.  
Since the last renewal, the following type II variations have been submitted and assessed by CHMP:  
-The primary analysis for SOB 019 (study to confirm the efficacy and safety of Vaxzevria from the 
pooled pivotal studies COV001, COV002, COV003 and COV005) was submitted 
(EMA/H/C/005675/II/0002) with resolution of the primary analysis obligation on 24 June 2021. The 
new data included additional immunogenicity data and a small number of additional COVID-19 cases 
as compared to the analysis made at the time of the MA. The new data did not modify the efficacy and 
the safety conclusions, nor the original positive benefit risk as determined at the time of the 
conditional MA.  
- The primary analysis for SOB 020 (to confirm the efficacy and safety of Vaxzevria in the elderly and 
subjects with underlying disease from clinical trial D8110C00001) was submitted 
(EMA/H/C/005675/II/0026) with obligation resolution on 15 October 2021. Study D8110C00001 is a 
Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study in adults to determine the 
safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of two doses of AZD1222 given with a 4-week time interval for 
the prevention of COVID-19. The trial was carried out in the US, Chile and Peru. The Vaccine efficacy 
determined against COVID-19 symptomatic illness that occurred ≥15 days post second dose of study 
intervention was 73.9% (95%CI: 65.3 – 80.4), a VE which was in line with that described when MA 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 17/21 
 
 
 
 
 
was granted. High VE estimate was also determined in participants ≥65 years of age [VE: 83.5% 
(95%CI:  54.1 – 94.0)], and these results provided evidence of VE in this old population, an important 
result that was lacking at the time CMA was granted, since the pivotal trials included a small number of 
subjects ≥65 yoa. Moreover, participants with one or more comorbidities who received Vaxzevria (≥15 
days post dose 2) had an efficacy of 75.2% (95% CI: 64.2; 82.9) and participants without 
comorbidities had a vaccine efficacy of 71.8% (95% CI: 55.5, 82.1). Changes in the SmPc were 
incorporated to describe the results from the clinical trial D8110C00001. 
-The results from clinical trial D7220C00001, which evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a 1-
dose booster vaccination of Vaxzervria in previously vaccinated adult participants (either with AZD1222 
or an mRNA vaccine), was assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0052; May 2022. The efficacy 
of an homologous and heterologous booster (participants who had previously received primary 
vaccination with an mRNA vaccine) was demonstrated in terms of immunogenicity. Based on the 
results from this Clinical trial, the SmPC was updated to incorporate the use of AZD1222 as a 
homologous or heterologous (on subjects that received a primary series of an mRNA vaccine) booster.  
Thus, the vaccine efficacy has been confirmed and updated with the results of clinical studies that were 
not available at the time of the initial marketing authorisation. 
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Remaining uncertainties are the same raised at the time the conditional MA was granted. On the one 
hand, protection conferred to certain risk groups (such as immunocompromised subjects and pregnant 
women) is unknown, and on the other hand, comprehensive data on protection (and duration of 
protection) achieved against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile for the primary vaccination series were defined in the initial marketing authorization 
based on the pooled safety data for the studies COV001, COV002, COV003 and COV005 (data cut-off 
4th Nov 2020) and in the procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0002 that updates the primary analysis of 
the pooled studies to cut-off date 7th Dec 2020. In addition, the safety profile for the primary 
vaccination was evaluated in the procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0026 with the primary analysis of the 
study D8110C00001 conducted in United States, Peru and Chile.  
Overall, most of the local and systemic AEs following AZD1222 were mild or moderate and self-
limiting. The most frequently reported adverse events (within 7 days after any vaccination) are 
injection site tenderness, injection site pain, headache, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, chills, arthralgia and 
nausea. The incidences of reported adverse events were less frequent after the second dose than after 
the first dose of AZD1222. In addition, the adverse events were reported in adults aged ≥ 65 less 
frequently than in adults aged 18-64 and higher incidences were observed in females than in males. 
Moreover, some AEs such as Transverse Myelitis, Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia Syndrome, 
Cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis without thrombocytopenia, Guillain-Barre syndrome, 
Capillary leak syndrome and anaphylaxis were included as ADR in the SmPC with frequencies not 
known or very rare as a consequence of the post marketing use of Vaxzevria for primary vaccination.  
The safety profile of the booster dose of AZD1222 (homologous and heterologous) was evaluated in 
the procedure EMEA/H/C/005675/II/0052 based on interim analysis from the study D7220C00001. The 
reactogenicity profile of the booster dose was similar and not different to the known reactogenicity 
described for AZD1222. However, higher frequencies of adverse events were observed after the 
booster dose in the heterologous regimen than in the homologous one. In line with what was observed 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 18/21 
 
 
 
with the primary vaccination series, the incidences of the adverse events were lower in adults aged ≥ 
65 years than younger adults and higher in females than in males.  
In summary, the safety of the vaccine has been confirmed and updated with the results of clinical 
studies and post marketing experience generated since the the initial marketing authorisation. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The uncertainties and limitations of unfavourable effects have been discussed in other procedures. The 
principal uncertainties are related to long-term effects, interactions with other vaccines and effects in 
specific risk groups.   
Regarding the booster dose, there were no data from participants aged <30 years in the study 
D7220C00001. However, it is to be expected that the reactogenicity pattern after a booster dose will 
be similar between subjects aged 18-29 years and subjects ≥30 years, with the exception of the 
frequencies profile, since it is known that the reactogenicity decreases with the age. In addition, it is 
not possible to determine the risk of several rare severe adverse reactions associated with the use of 
AZD1222, such as capillary leak syndrome, cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis, myelitis 
transverse and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after AZD1222 booster dose, especially in 
previously mRNA-vaccinated subjects who will receive AZD1222 vaccine for the first time.  
Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The benefits of Vaxzevria in terms of protection against COVID-19 outweigh the risks associated with 
vaccination. Although new data has emerged during this last year, these new data does not change the 
positive B/R balance in the approved indication.  
Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the cumulative evidence in terms of favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk 
profile of Vaxzevria remains positive. 
Scientific grounds for recommending the granting of a marketing 
authorisation not subject to specific obligations 
Quality 
The remaining quality SOB (SOB 014) may be reclassified as a REC. 
This specific obligation regarding stability data was raised because, at the time of the conditional 
authorisation, in order to ensure consistent product quality, there was a need for additional stability 
data from all manufacturing sites to support the shelf life granted, both for the active substance and 
for the finished product.  The Company has been providing stability data in monthly updates indicating 
that product stability is guaranteed for the approved shelf life.Concurrently, there is a variation (IB 81) 
under evaluation to extend the shelf-life of the finished product, Vaxzevria Suspension for Injection, as 
packaged for sale, from 6 months to 9 months when stored at 2-8˚C. This variation concluded 
positively on 7th October 2022. 
Non-clinical 
There are no non-clinical SOBs to be addressed. 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/CHMP/679008/2022  
Page 19/21 
 
 
 
Clinical 
During the reporting period, there were 11 ongoing clinical trials and 1 was completed. As of 31 May 
2022 approximately 60518 study participants enrolled in AZD1222 Clinical Development program had 
received at least one dose of VAXZEVRIA.  
Vaxzevria has been approved in 93 countries. Cumulatively, a total of 2.08 billion doses of Vaxzevria 
have been delivered to the EU and other 24 countries and, as of 31 May 2022, more than 2.828 billion 
vaccine doses have been administered globally. 
The overall benefits of VAXZEVRIA in the prevention of COVID-19 with robust efficacy overall, in a wide 
array of subgroups, including adults ≥ 65 years of age and persons with at least one comorbidity at 
enrolment, and in the prevention of severe/critical COVID-19 illness and COVID-19 related emergency 
department visits and deaths continue to outweigh risks from adverse drug reactions, including the 
very rare risk of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia identified through post-marketing 
safety reports.  
The current analysis of the benefit-risk profile incorporates an evaluation of the information that 
became available during the reporting period. The benefits of vaccination with VAXZEVRIA as 2-dose 
primary series and a booster dose is demonstrated in clinical studies and real word evidence. The 
safety profile of VAXZEVRIA continued to evolve during the reporting period with availability of safety 
information in the post-marketing setting. 
In conclusion, the initial MA established the positive benefit-risk profile of Vaxzevria in adults 18 years 
of age and older, and additional CT data as well as Pharmacovigilance information together with post-
authorization effectiveness studies corroborate the positive B/R for this vaccine. The VAXZEVRIA 
product information is up to date with current scientific knowledge, taking into account any proposed 
updates to the SmPC, package leaflet, labelling and RMP. 
According to the Guideline on the conditional MA (EMA/CHMP/509951/2006, Rev.1), section 6. MA not 
subject to SOB:  “When the specific obligations have been fulfilled, the CHMP may, in accordance with 
Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, adopt an opinion recommending the granting of 
a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (‘marketing 
authorisation not subject to specific obligations’).This can be done at the time of renewal of the 
conditional marketing authorisation or at the time of assessment of the data submitted to fulfil the last 
remaining specific obligation.” 
Therefore, the efficacy and safety of Vaxzevria has been comprehensively characterized, both with 
data from CT and from Real World Evidence, and the currently pending information in relation to the 
original SOBs is the final CSR from individual studies COV001, COV002, COV003, COV005, and 
D8110C00001, as well as  the final analysis from the pooled pivotal studies (efficacy analysis from 
trials COV002 and COV003, and a pooled safety analysis based on all four trials COV001, COV002, 
COV003, and COV005). The MAH has asked for renewal of the current CMA. However, the final CSRs 
still pending are not expected to change the positive benefit/risk of this vaccine and therefore, it is 
considered that the current conditional approval could be converted into a full marketing authorization. 
Due to the transformation into a full MA, these previous SOBs should be reclassified as category 3 
studies in the RMP and the final study reports for the ongoing clinical trials shall be submitted by the 
applicant according to the given due dates.  
Overall, taking into account that the quality and clinical data submitted by the MAH during the period 
covered by this annual renewal do not change the benefit/risk balance of the vaccine in the approved 
indication all SOBs can be removed from Annex II. The remaining quality SOB can be re-classified as a 
REC and the remaining clinical SOBs can be reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP. Therefore, 
the current CMA can be converted to a full marketing authorization.

7.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, 
the benefit-risk balance for Vaxzevria in its approved indication(s) (please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics) continues to be favourable and all specific obligations have been fulfilled or re-
classified as RMP category 3 or REC, and therefore the granting of a marketing authorisation no longer 
subject to specific obligations is recommended, subject to the conditions and obligations as detailed in 
this assessment report.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
The Annexes I, II and III to the current marketing authorisation for the above-mentioned medicinal 
product were amended to reflect the granting of a marketing authorisation no longer subject to 
Specific Obligations for Vaxzevria and to implement other minor administrative updates.  
The renewal requires no amendments to the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
Conditions of the marketing authorisation  
The marketing authorisation is subject to the following conditions: 
• 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
• 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Due date 
In order to ensure that all reported thrombotic events with 
30 November 2023 
thrombocytopenia and/or bleeding events are investigated by performing an 
in-depth exploration of platelet function in the interventional study in 
immunocompromised subjects, the MAH should submit the clinical study 
report, in accordance with a revised and agreed study protocol. 
PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

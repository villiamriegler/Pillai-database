2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hepatitis C viral infection is a global health problem, with 184 million individuals chronically infected 
worldwide. An estimated 13.2 million children between the ages of 1 and 15 years old are infected with 
HCV globally.  
Within Europe's paediatric population, prevalence of HCV ranges from 0.05% to 0.36%. New HCV 
infections among the 5–14 year old age group represented 0.4% of all new infections, while the infections 
in the age group of 15–19 year represented 1.2% of all new infections in the EU/European Economic Area 
(EEA) during 2015. 
Although the majority of children have a mild disease and do not need urgent treatment, guidance 
published by the Hepatology Committee of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, 
Assessment report  
EMA/154469/2019  
Page 6/34 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) in 2018 recommend that all children with chronic HCV infection 
should be considered for treatment, in view of the fact that the rationale underlying the indication for the 
treatment of adults with chronic HCV infection is also valid for children.  
Current approved treatment options for children less than 12 years old remains limited, as IFN-free DAA 
regimens are not yet approved for use in this paediatric subset. For adolescents, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
(LDV/SOF) and SOF + RBV have been recently approved for use, but they are not pan genotypic IFN-free 
and the recommended regimen for HCV GT2 and GT3 infection require co-administration with RBV. 
Maviret, the fixed dose combination of NS3/4A protease inhibitor glecaprevir and NS5A inhibitor 
pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB), was first authorized in EU in 2017 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C 
infection in adults. It has been approved for treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced (i.e. who failed 
prior therapy with peg-IFN+RBV+/-SOF or SOF+RBV) GT1 to GT6-infected patients with compensated 
liver disease (with or without cirrhosis).  
This application for an extension of the indication to adolescents is supported by new clinical data from 
part 1 of Study M16-123 [An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, 
and Efficacy of Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir in Pediatric Subjects with Genotypes 1 - 6 Chronic Hepatitis C 
Virus (HCV) Infection (DORA)] which evaluated the use of the adult co-formulated tablets in adolescents 
(12 to < 18 years of age). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
The  environmental  risk  assessment  has  been  updated  in  accordance  with  the  EMA  Guideline  on  the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (2006) and EMA's Questions and 
Answers on the Guideline (2011) (Q&A) for the extended indication. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
During  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  application  in  adults,  the  applicant  had  already  performed 
Phase I studies for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir that revealed PECSURFACEWATER values in excess of 0.01 
µg/L,  and  Phase  II  studies  (Tier  A  and  Tier  B)  were  in  progress.  In  addition,  the  log  D  value  for 
pibrentasvir was greater than three, which required an evaluation for the bio-concentration potential for 
this compound. Updated environmental risk assessments for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were submitted 
for assessment and agreed upon by CHMP during subsequent regulatory procedures. 
In this extension of indication application, the applicant provided a justification in lieu of a full ERA for 
glecaprevir and pibrentasvir. 
Firstly, it was explained that the calculated PEC SURFACEWATER values for these compounds will be the same 
as the value calculated for the initially approved indication as: 1) the recommended doses for glecaprevir 
and pibrentasvir for adolescents will be the same as the adult doses, and 2) the Fpen will not change as the 
default (conservative) Fpen was used in the original calculation.  
Secondly,  it  was  highlighted  that  the  PEC SURFACEWATER  values  originally  calculated  for  glecaprevir  and 
pibrentasvir exceeded the 0.01 µg/L, therefore the required Tier B studies were completed; additionally, 
the  log  D  value  of  pibrentasvir  necessitated  completion  of  a  study  to  evaluate  its  potential  for 
bioaccumulation.  To  date,  no  effects  of  these  compounds  on  the  environment  have  been  detected. 
Nevertheless, the marketing authorisation holder mentioned that the ERA for pibrentasvir will be updated 
upon completion of all required studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/154469/2019  
Page 7/34 
 
 
 
Finally, it was also explained by the marketing authorisation holder that all studies that would be required 
for  the  new  indication  for  glecaprevir  and  pibrentasvir  have  already  been  completed  and  that  no 
additional  studies  would  be  required  and  no  additional  revisions  to  the  ERAs  for  glecaprevir  and 
pibrentasvir  to  reflect  this  additional  indication  would  be  needed  or  justified.  CHMP  agreed  with  the 
marketing authorisation holder position. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered the non-clinical data presented by the marketing authorisation holder as sufficient 
for the purpose of this extension of indication application. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The approved commercial formulation for adults was used in the HCV-infected adolescent subjects (12 to 
< 18 years of age) in Study M16-123. This formulation was used on the basis that adolescents are likely 
to have a similar weight distribution as observed in the adult program, are willing to swallow tablets, and 
therefore are suited to take the existing GLE/PIB 100 mg/40 mg co-formulated tablet.  
There are no new biopharmaceutical data applicable to this submission.

In Part 1 of Study M16-123, PK analyses were conducted for 10 subjects who took at least 1 dose of 
GLE/PIB and had at least 1 PK sample taken.  
Intensive plasma samples for quantitation of GLE and PIB concentrations following daily administration of 
GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg were collected at Study Week 2 Visit. 
It  was  noted  that  3  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  PK  analyses  due  to  unusually  low  GLE  and  PIB 
concentrations at the Week 2 visit. The 3 subjects were 12–13 years old and weighed 58–65 kg. Their 
intensive GLE and PIB concentrations collected at the Week 2 visit were exceptionally low compared to 
those from the other 10 subjects. Such low exposures cannot be explained by the allometry. All 3 subjects 
were from the same study site and were the only subjects enrolled at that site. According to the MAH, one 
possible explanation of the discrepancy could be due to an improper sample collection procedure at the 
site,  since  the  Week  2  samples  from  these  subjects  were  collected  using  venous  catheter,  instead  of 
venipuncture,  as  used  in  other  study  visits.  Despite  unusually  low  GLE  and  PIB  concentrations,  all  3 
subjects achieved SVR12 without clinically significant AEs, and tolerated the full course of GLE/PIB. 
A  summary  of  PK  parameters  of  GLE  and  PIB  at  the  Week  2  visit,  including  the  primary  PK  endpoint 
(steady-state  area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  [AUC])  and  secondary  PK  endpoints 
(maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax] and clearance [CL/F]) is presented below: 
Table 1 Geometric Mean (Mean, CV%) PK Parameters of GLE and PIB (Week 2 IPK) 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses used data from four Phase 2 studies (Studies M13-595, M14-867, 
M14-868,  and  M15-410)  and  six  Phase  3  studies  (Studies  M13-590,  M15-464,  M13-594,  M13-583, 
M14-172, and M15-462) were conducted for GLE and PIB in HCV-infected adults. 
The observed GLE and PIB geometric mean steady-state exposures (AUC) in the HCV-infected adolescent 
subjects  (12  to  <  18  years  of  age)  were  4790  ng*h/mL  and  1380  ng*h/mL,  respectively,  and  were 
comparable to the reported geometric mean GLE and PIB AUC values (4800 ng*h/mL and 1430 ng*h/mL, 
respectively) in HCV-infected non-cirrhotic adults:

and Adult Subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/154469/2019  
Page 9/34 
 
 
 
 
 
The observed GLE and PIB exposure ranges in adolescents were within the exposure ranges of GLE and 
PIB that were shown to be well tolerated and efficacious in HCV-infected non-cirrhotic adults.  
The medians of GLE and PIB Ctrough values, defined as binned concentrations 22 to 26 hours post dosing 
in HCV-infected adolescent subjects from 12 to < 18 years of age were 5.06 ng/mL and 18.2 ng/mL, 
respectively,  which  were  comparable  to  the  reported  median  Ctrough  ranges  observed  in  HCV-infected 
non-cirrhotic adult subjects in Phase 3 studies (6.11 - 7.53 ng/mL for GLE, 14.6 – 22.0 ng/mL for PIB). 
The relationships between steady-state GLE and PIB exposures (AUC24) and subjects' age and weight 
were  evaluated  (graphically  and  by  simple  linear  regression  analysis)  and  no  significant  relationship 
between weight and exposures or between age and exposures was observed:

The  PK  results  support  the  use  of  the  approved  adult  regimen  of  GLE/PIB  300  mg/120  mg  QD  in 
HCV-infected adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age). No significant relationship between weight 
and exposures or between age and exposures was observed. The population included in this analysis 
covers the respective ages within the adolescent range (12 to 16 years of age and a median age of 14.5 
years),  with  weights  ranging  from  a  minimum  of  45.6  kg  up  to  78.3  kg  and  a  mean  of  58.7  kg,  and 
demonstrated exposures comparable to those demonstrated in the adult HCV-infected subjects. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new data were submitted in support of this application. This was considered acceptable by CHMP, since 
both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have non-host targets and therefore no differences in antiviral activity 
are expected between adults and children. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
No new PK/PD data were submitted in support of this application. This was considered acceptable by 
CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
CHMP noted that an expert meeting on paediatric development of CHC medicines was held at the EMA in 
December 2014. The main objective of the expert meeting was to improve and fasten the development of 
DAAs in children. Following recommendation from this EMA expert meeting, the MAH planned a paediatric 
study whose primary endpoint is PK exposure. 
CHMP considered this approach reasonable, having in mind the high efficacy and favourable safety profile 
of  DAA,  including  Maviret,  in  adults.  It  was  noted  that  there  was  no  obvious  reason  for  expecting  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/154469/2019  
Page 11/34 
 
 
 
 
different efficacy/safety in children and that, provided that a comparable PK exposure was documented, 
extrapolation from data obtained in adults would be acceptable. 
AUC24 at W2 has been estimated from 10 adolescent 12-18 y (all weighing >45kg) that received the adult 
dose and formulation. Exposure has been shown to be comparable to adults. 
The adult tablet was used in adolescents (from 12 to less than 18 years of age) who are able to swallow 
the tablet. This has been judged agreeable by CHMP and had already been agreed upon with PDCO in the 
Paediatric Investigation Plan. Despite the fact that, based on simulation, the adolescent dose would be 
250mg GLE/100mg PIB, it was considered agreeable to initiate the adolescent cohort with the adult dose 
(300/120mg) to enable earlier initiation since it was not expected the resulting 20% higher exposure 
would increase significantly the safety risk for this population. 
CHMP noted that no weight criterion seemed to have been included in the study protocol, but that all the 
children included in the intensive PK cohort finally weighted more than 45kg. During the assessment, at 
CHMP request the marketing authorisation holder discussed the extent to which adolescents weighing 
less than 45 kg could safely receive Maviret, in particular since the expected weight range in 12 year old 
children would be 30-62 kg (5th–95th percentile). It was clarified that while no subjects in the IPK cohort 
weighed less than 45 kg, in the full Part 1 adolescent cohort a broader range of weights were included. 
The  population  PK  analysis  (of  Part  1  All  Adolescents  in  Study  M16-123)  included  subjects  with  body 
weight ranging from 32.0 to 108.9 kg and age ranging from 12 to 17 years, which adequately covered the 
expected weight range. The evaluation of weight and age on the PK of GLE and PIB showed that neither 
body  weight  nor  age  was  a  significant  covariate  for  the  exposures  of  GLE  and  PIB  and  that  all 
47 adolescent subjects in the full cohort in Part 1 achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks post 
treatment (SVR12) and tolerated Maviret well with no reports of serious adverse events (SAEs) or adverse 
events  (AEs)  leading  to  interruption  of  or  discontinuation  from  treatment.  Estimated  GLE  and  PIB 
exposures in the subjects with lower body weights were comparable to those in the subjects with higher 
body weight. Results from the population PK analysis also indicated that the steady-state GLE and PIB 
exposures of all of these subjects fell within the predicted margins of safety established by the larger adult 
programme. The relationships between model-predicted steady-state GLE and PIB exposures (area under 
the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours post-dose [AUC24]) in the full cohort of 
Part 1 and subjects' age and weight were evaluated using linear regression, and no statistically significant 
(P-value > 0.05)  or  clinically  meaningful  relationships  were  observed  between  weight  and  GLE/PIB 
exposures or between age and GLE/PIB exposures. Since there was no relationship between body weight 
and exposures and the weights of the adolescent subjects dosed in M16-123 cover the lowest percentiles 
on  growth  charts,  no  weight  restriction  was  proposed  to  be  included  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics  (SmPC),  as  subjects  weighing  less  than  45  kg  were  successfully  treated  with  Maviret 
(GLE/PIB, 300 mg/120 mg). CHMP agreed to the MAH proposal. 
CHMP considered the exclusion of 3 patients from the PK analysis that was now based on 13 patients only 
as unfortunate, but acknowledged that the unusual concentrations reported for the 3 outliers (all included 
in the same site centre) was likely due to a collection issue rather than a true PK concern. Indeed, the 
values of the PK parameter spoke in favour of an issue linked to data collection and all 3 patients achieved 
SVR. Nevertheless, at CHMP request, the MAH explained that full investigations for the reason behind 
unusual concentrations reported in the 3 outliers from the same site centre had been explored. Use of IV 
line was the likely cause for the lower exposures observed and that it might have occurred due to an 
inadequate procedure around the IV collection. Reassuringly, the sparse PK samples for the 3 patients 
(identified as outliers in intensive PK study) were comparable to those of other study patients. As a 
measure to ensure quality of the study process, the study centre had been excluded from enrolling 
patients in the IPK portion of part 2 of study M16-123. CHMP agreed to the presented approach and 
considered it was satisfactory.  
Assessment report  
EMA/154469/2019  
Page 12/34 
 
 
 
At CHMP request, during the assessment, the MAH also provided demographic data for the 3 patients with 
low GLE/PIB concentrations in the intensive PK analysis. It was noted that they were of different races and 
sexes (1 Black/African American [male], 2 White [1 male, 1 female]) and that all 3 subjects were either 
12 or 13 years old. Moreover, no significant relationship between weight and exposure or age and 
exposure was identified in PPK analysis. Since only the IPK sampling and not the sparse PK sampling for 
the 3 patients showed low GLE/PIB concentration, CHMP agreed that demographic data did not account 
for the unusual concentrations observed and that the inadequate removal of solution in the IV line before 
collecting blood for the IPK sampling was the likely explanation for the 3 outliers. 
CHMP also noted that PK exposure in adolescents was estimated based on intensive PK analysis on 10 
adolescents aged 12-16 years of age (median: 14.5 years) weighting 45-78 kg (mean 58.7 kg). A 
comparable exposure between adolescents and adults is documented based on this analysis. It was 
considered reasonably reassuring on the similarity between the PK in adults and adolescents by the fact 
that no major difference has been detected on the PK data issued from such limited sample size. 
During the assessment, the MAH has also submitted data from 34 additional subjects from the non-IPK 
analysis (see clinical section of the AR). 
CHMP agreed that efficacy can be extrapolated from adults based on similar exposure. 
CHMP also noted that drug-drug interactions have not been discussed by the MAH in this application, but 
that this was not expected to be a major concern in children. As for adults, Maviret is not the medicine of 
choice for HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving boosted PI, and alternative DAA regimen are authorized 
in children for use in this situation. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considered the data presented by the marketing authorisation holder as sufficient for the 
purpose of this extension of indication application. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Title of Study: M16-123 (DORA) 
Methods 
This is a Phase 2/3, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the PK, efficacy, and safety of GLE/PIB in 
chronic HCV GT1 –GT6 infected paediatric subjects. The study has been designed to satisfy the different 
EU Paediatric Investigation Plan and US FDA iPSP requirements, the main difference of which was the 
inclusion of an expanded population of subjects to fulfil the iPSP requirements. Indeed, the paediatric 
study was recommended to include an expanded number of subjects for safety (a total of approximately 
100).  
The study is divided into 2 parts:  
Part 1 of the study allowed for enrolment of approximately 44 HCV GT1 - GT6 infected adolescent subjects 
into the 12 to < 18 years old age group who were willing to swallow the adult formulation of GLE/PIB 
(Cohort 1).  
Part 2 of the study allows for enrolment of approximately 66 HCV GT1 - GT6 infected paediatric subjects 
divided into the 9 to < 12 (Cohort 2), 6 to < 9 (Cohort 3), and 3 to < 6 (Cohort 4) years old age groups 
who will receive the paediatric formulation of GLE/PIB.

In each cohort, subjects will be enrolled first into the IPK portion, followed by the non-IPK safety/efficacy 
portion.  
Figure 3  
Study M16-123 Schematic 
Each cohort was expected to enrol approximately 12 HCV-infected paediatric subjects in the IPK portions 
to adequately characterize the PK of a particular age group for dose confirmation (had to be HCV TN and 
HIV-negative, and the HCV genotype must have been identified for these subjects), and the remainder of 
subjects  will  be  enrolled  for  the  evaluation  of  safety  and  efficacy  of  each  age  group  until  the  total 
paediatric  study  population  reaches  approximately  110  subjects  (TN  or  TE  [prior  IFN,  RBV,  or  SOF 
exposure], with or without HIV-1 coinfection, and could include subjects with mixed or indeterminate HCV 
genotype). 
An  interim  analysis  for  this  cohort  (12  to  <  18  years  old)  occurred  once  all  subjects  undergoing  IPK 
analysis in Part 1 of the study completed the Post-Treatment (PT) Week 12 or prematurely discontinued 
from the study.  
The  data  from  these  analyses  were  initially  provided  in  to  support  the  addition  of  the  adolescent 
population (12 to < 18 years old) to the adult tablet indication. 
Of note, in the EU PIP it was agreed that a minimum number of subjects are to be enrolled in each IPK age 
cohort, in order to expedite paediatric development and accelerate access to patients, also in accordance 
with the EMA Report of the paediatric hepatitis C therapy expert meeting (EMA/87232/2015).  
Data from 34 additional adolescent subjects, which became available in Q3 2018, were also submitted 
during the procedure.

Treatments 
Part 1 Adult Formulation: 
The study drug (GLE/PIB) was dispensed as film coated co-formulated 100 mg/40 mg tablets. Subjects 
were instructed to take study drug orally as 3 tablets QD (corresponding to GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg) to 
be swallowed whole.  
All subjects were assigned to receive 8 weeks of treatment in the IPK part. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study are: 
- 
to assess the steady state area  under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and to assess the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of GLE/PIB in paediatric subjects following multiple dosing by age group; 
Assessment report  
EMA/154469/2019  
Page 15/34 
 
 
 
 
- 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GLE/PIB by age group, cirrhosis status and across all 
subjects. 
The secondary objectives of this study are to further assess the efficacy of GLE/PIB by assessing: 
-  Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and clearance of GLE and PIB; 
- 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  sustained  virologic  response  for  12  weeks  post-treatment

group and overall (primary objective for the US regulatory agency only); 
- 
- 
- 
The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure (i.e., breakthrough or failure 
to suppress at the end of treatment) summarized for each age group and overall; 
The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV relapse summarized for each age group and 
overall; 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  new  HCV  infection  (or  reinfection)  summarized  for  each  age 
group and overall; 
-  Assess PK and emergence/persistence of viral variants in subjects with available samples; 
-  Assessment of palatability/acceptability of paediatric formulation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary PK endpoints were: 
-  Steady state AUC values for GLE and PIB estimated by non-compartmental analysis or population 
PK analysis including AUC at Week 2 in subjects with IPK samples and AUC in all subjects with or 
without IPK samples. 
The secondary endpoints in Part 1 and Part 2 were: 
-  Cmax and clearance of GLE and PIB at Week 2; 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The percentage of subjects with SVR12 by age group and overall (primary efficacy variable for US 
regulatory agency); 
The percentage of subjects with on-treatment virologic failure (i.e., breakthrough or failure to 
suppress at end of treatment) by age group and overall; 
The percentage of subjects with post-treatment relapse by age group and overall; 
The percentage of subjects with new HCV infection (i.e., reinfection) at any time up to the last 
study visit by age group and overall; 
-  Assessment of palatability/acceptability of the paediatric formulation. 
Sample size 
Planned: Approximately 110 subjects overall including approximately 48 subjects in the IPK portion of the 
study (12 subjects for each age group).

Results 
Recruitment 
A total of 8 sites in the United States (US; and its territory, Puerto Rico) enrolled subjects in the intensive 
pharmacokinetic (IPK) portion of Part 1 of the study. 
A total of 14 subjects were enrolled and 13 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug. No subject 
prematurely discontinued study drug.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol (dated 15 December 2016) was amended 4 times (2 global and 2 country-specific). 
Thirteen  subjects  were  enrolled  under  the  original  protocol  and  1  subject  was  enrolled  under  Global 
Protocol Amendment 1.  
The protocol changes described in the amendments did not affect the interpretation of the results in this 
study.

Protocol deviations 
There were no ICH defined protocol deviations reported. In addition, deviations from the protocol were 
assessed  for  impact  on  analyses  and  data  integrity  or  subject's  safety.  None  of  the  deviations  was 
considered to have affected the study outcome or interpretation of the study results or conclusions.  
No significant PK sampling time deviations occurred during the conduct of this study. 
Baseline data 
The MAH initially submitted data from the 13 patients included in the IPK analysis. Additional data from 34 
additional subjects from the non-IPK analysis were submitted during the procedure.

CHMP noted that all patients were from US. The study included 7 female and 6 male, most of whom were 
white (n=10), with the 3 remaining patients being black. All 13 had weight >45kg.  
In accordance with the inclusion criterion for IPK part, all 13 patients were TN, non HIV-co-infected 
without cirrhosis. As a matter of fact, all 13 had F0-F1 fibrosis stage. With the exception of 1 GT3 and 1 
GT2 patients, all were infected by HCV GT1 (There were 7 GT1a and 4 GT1b). 
Even though CHMP acknowledged that efficacy data in other than GT1 TN non cirrhotic adolescent could 
likely be extrapolated from adult efficacy studies, the MAH was requested to clarify whether efficacy data 
was available from the full adolescent cohort to document efficacy in non GT1 and cirrhotic patients. 
In response to CHMP request, apart from the already submitted data of the 13 patients included in the IPK 
analysis, the MAH submitted data of 34 additional patients. The final study population was now of 47 
adolescents of whom 4 (8.5%) were infected with HCV GT3, 11 (23.4%) were treatment-experienced (all 
11 received previous IFN-based regimen) and 2 (4.3%) were HIV/HCV co-infected. No patients had 
cirrhosis. As a matter of fact, almost all (n=45) were F0-F1, 1 had baseline fibrosis stage F2 and 1 had 
baseline fibrosis stage F3.

duration per protocol (and in accordance with SmPC recommendation). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Based  on  the  initially  submitted  data,  it  was  noted  that  sustained  virologic  response  12  weeks 
post-treatment was achieved by 100% (13/13) of subjects in the ITT population. No subjects experienced 
on-treatment  virologic  failure  (breakthrough  or  end-of-treatment  failure),  relapse,  or  had  a  new  HCV 
infection (reinfection) at any time up to the last study visit.

(SVR 12) (ITT Population) 
Additional  efficacy  endpoints  included  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  HCV  RNA  <  lower  limit  of 
quantitation (LLOQ) at each post-baseline visit in the Treatment Period. By Week 4, 92.3% (12/13) of 
subjects achieved HCV RNA < LLOQ. 
After submission of the additional data by the MAH, CHMP noted that all 47 adolescents had achieved 
SVR 12.

Note:  Backward  imputation,  where  applicable,  was  used  to  impute  missing  data.  After  applying  backward 
imputation,  if  there  was  still  no  value  in  the  window  but  there  was  an  HCV  RNA  from  a  local  laboratory 
present, then it was to be imputed into the SVR window. Otherwise, subjects with missing data were counted 
as failures. 
Even though no data are available in patients with advanced fibrosis (as one can expect from a paediatric 
population), those additional data provide further evidence of the efficacy of Maviret in more difficult to 
treat patients such as TE and GT3 patients. 
Efficacy  analysis  by  demographic  or  baseline  characteristic,  including  baseline  HCV  RNA  level,  HCV 
genotype, or baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and/or NS5A was not possible given the lack of virological 
failure in this part.

Baseline polymorphisms in NS3 were not detected at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 in any of the 
GT1 – GT3-infected subjects. The prevalence of NS3 Q80K in GT1a-infected subjects was high (71.4%, 
5/7). Baseline polymorphisms at amino acid positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 in NS5A were detected 
in  33.3%  (4/12)  of  the  GT1  –  GT3-infected  subjects;  Y93H  in  NS5A  was  detected  in  the  single 
GT3a-infected subject. CHMP noted that baseline polymorphisms had no impact on treatment outcome in 
this interim analysis. Of note, the GT3 patients included in the IPK had Y93H at baseline and achieved 
SVR. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study M16-123 is a single arm open label study conducted in children from 3 to <18 years of age. CHMP 
considered that the overall design was acceptable. As for adults, a comparator arm would have entailed 
feasibility  issues  and  was  not  mandatory,  given  the  high  expected  SVR  rate  obtained  with  new  DAA 
regimens. 
Initially, the interim data including the PK, efficacy and safety from the 13 adolescents dosed with the 
adult  GLE/PIB  tablet  in  the  intensive  PK  cohort  were  presented.  During  the  procedure,  data  from  34 
additional  subjects  from  the  non-IPK  analysis  were  also  submitted  and  assessed.  Among  these  47 
subjects,  there  were  4  subjects  (8.5%)  with  HCV  genotype  3,  11  treatment  experienced  subjects 
(23.4%), 2 HIV/HCV co-infected subjects (4.3%), and no cirrhotic subjects. 
All 47 adolescent subjects (100% [CI: 92.4, 100.0]) achieved SVR12. 
Along with the PK data showing comparable exposure between adolescents and adults dosed with the 
GLE/PIB  300/120mg  regimen,  the  MAH  requests  the  extension  of  the  approved  adult  regimen  in 
adolescent from 12 to <18 years of age, whatever the genotypes, TN or TE (DAA-naïve) status, presence 
or not of cirrhosis or HIV co-infection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/154469/2019  
Page 25/34 
 
 
 
 
CHMP agreed that efficacy can be extrapolated from adults based on comparable exposure, but noted 
during the procedure that the presented data in adolescents were available from only 13 patients at this 
stage, all being TN non cirrhotic patients. There is no obvious reason that efficacy/safety would differ 
between children and adults as long as exposure is similar. Therefore the MAH was requested to provide 
the  additional  efficacy  data  from  the  full  adolescent  cohort.  This  was  done  and  the  additional  data 
presented, despite no data were available in patients with advanced fibrosis (as could be expected from 
this paediatric patients), were supportive of the initial conclusion and provided further evidence on the 
efficacy of Maviret in more difficult to treat patients such as TE and GT3 patients.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP agreed that this extension of indication application for Maviret is approvable from an efficacy 
perspective. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety population initially comprised thirteen subjects (n=13) whom all were being treated for 8 
weeks. 
As above underlined, there were 7 female and 6 male, and all were originated from North America (10 
Non-Black, 3 Black). All patients weighed 45kg or more. 
All subjects were non cirrhotic, F0-F1 fibrosis stage, treatment-naïve, with no HCV/HIV coinfection and 
the majority of subjects were GT1-infected.  
One adolescent had a history of depression or bipolar disorder. 
During the procedure, the marketing authorisation holder provided the data from the full adolescent 
cohort, which comprised the 13 patients from the intensive PK analysis and 34 additional patients. 
The final study population consisted of 47 adolescents of whom 4 (8.5%) were infected with HCV GT3, 11 
(23.4%) were treatment-experienced (all 11 received previous IFN-based regimen) and 2 (4.3%) were 
HIV/HCV co-infected. No patients had cirrhosis. As a matter of fact, almost all (n=45) were F0-F1, 1 had 
baseline fibrosis stage F2 and 1 had baseline fibrosis stage F3. 
Three GT3-infected, treatment-experienced and non-cirrhotic subjects were assigned to the 16 week 
treatment duration; the remaining 44 non-cirrhotic subjects were assigned to the 8 week treatment 
duration per protocol (and in accordance with SmPC recommendation). 
Summary of Resistance Analyses 
Of the 47 subjects dosed in Cohort 1, the number of subjects infected with each of the following HCV 
subtypes by phylogenetic analysis of NS3/4A and/or NS5A sequences was: 24 GT1a (51.1%), 13 GT1b 
(27.7%), 1 GT2a (2.1%), 1 GT2b (2.1%), 1 GT2q (2.1%), 4 GT3a (8.5%), 2 GT4d (4.3%), and 1 GT4f 
(2.1%). Baseline polymorphisms in NS3 were not detected at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 in 
any of the GT1 – GT4- infected subjects. The prevalence of NS3 Q80K in GT1a-infected subjects was high 
(54.2%, 13/24). Baseline polymorphisms at amino acid positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 in NS5A 
were detected in 23.9% (11/46) of the GT1 – GT4-infected subjects; A30K and Y93H in NS5A were each 
detected in 25.0% (1/4) of the GT3a-infected subjects. All subjects in the mITT-VF population achieved 
SVR 12, indicating no evidence that baseline polymorphisms had an impact on treatment outcome.

Adverse events  
Table 11 Overview of adverse events in the IPK population 
Table 12 Most frequently reported (≥ 3 subjects) AEs in the IPK population 
The majority of subjects who experienced AEs had AEs with a maximum severity of Grade 1 (mild; 60%, 
6/10).  
One subject with a history of depression experienced a Grade 3 AE of depression and suicidal ideation 
during the study (at Day 14, reported as intermittent); the event was assessed as not study drug-related. 
Two subjects experienced study drug-related AEs that were Grade 1 in severity; one subject (the same 
patient who reported increased depression) experienced chills and decreased appetite at Day 1 and 4 
respectively  that  were  considered  as  related  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator;  the  other  subject 
experienced  somnolence  and  decreased  activity  at  day  1  and  lasted  for  4  days,  these  events  were 
considered related to study drug by the investigator. The drug was continued unchanged. 
Based on the additional data submitted, the analysis of the full dataset showed that adverse events were 
mostly mild in severity and unrelated to study drug, with the most common AEs (occurring in ≥ 10% 
subjects) being nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, fatigue, oropharyngeal 
pain, and pyrexia. Most of these events were assessed as not treatment related and likely due to expected 
seasonal variations of AEs/medical conditions common in the paediatric population. The most frequently 
reported adverse drug reaction (ADR) (reported in ≥ 5% overall) was fatigue (6.4% of subjects). Overall,

the fixed-dose combination of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg QD was well tolerated and demonstrated a 
favourable safety profile in adolescent subjects similar to the safety profile in adults. No new safety 
signals were identified.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As mentioned above, during the assessment the MAH provided the data from the full adolescent cohort 
consisting of the 13 patients included in the IPK analysis (already submitted in the first round) and of 34 
additional patients. The final study population was of 47 adolescents, of whom 4 (8.5%) were infected 
with HCV GT3, 11 (23.4%) were treatment-experienced (all 11 received previous IFN-based regimen) 
and 2 (4.3%) were HIV/HCV co-infected. No patients had cirrhosis and almost all (n=45) were F0-F1, 1 
had baseline fibrosis stage F2 and 1 had baseline fibrosis stage F3. 
Three GT3-infected, treatment-experienced and non-cirrhotic subjects were assigned to the 16 week 
treatment duration; the remaining 44 non-cirrhotic subjects were assigned to the 8 week treatment 
duration per protocol. 
CHMP agreed that no safety signals emerged from the expanded safety analysis pertaining to 47 subjects. 
The most frequently reported ADRs (>10%) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, 
headache, fatigue, oropharyngeal pain and pyrexia. None of the events of nasopharyngitis and upper 
respiratory tract infections were considered as drug-related. All AEs were of mild or moderate in severity 
(Grade 1 or 2), the majority were of Grade 1 (61%) and only one AE was qualified of severe (AE of 
depression in a patient with history of depression). This patient experienced a worsening of pre-existing 
depression associated with suicidal ideation 14 days after the beginning of Maviret therapy. The 
investigator did not consider a causal relationship with the antiviral therapy and it seemed that the event 
was more likely related to events of school bullying. The psychiatric disorders were reported to be 
resolved with psychotherapy, GLE/PIB was not stopped due to the events and the SVR was achieved. 
CHMP agreed that the role of GLE/PIB was difficult to ascertain in this case. No other cases of psychiatric 
disorders were reported during the study. However, due to the signal towards depression and suicidal 
ideation with other antivirals, it was agreed that the issue of psychiatric disorders, a fortiori in the 
vulnerable population of adolescents, should be scrutinized in forthcoming PSURs of GLE/PIB. 
Nine subjects experienced study drug related AEs (19.1%). The most commonly reported ADRs were 
fatigue (n=3, 6.4%), abdominal pain (n=2, 4.3%) and decreased appetite (n=2, 4.3%). The remaining 
study-drug related AEs were reported in only one patient each (abdominal distension, chills, crystal urine 
present, decreased activity, hyperbilirubinaemia, proteinuria, somnolence and vasculitic rash). In the 
Assessment report  
EMA/154469/2019  
Page 29/34 
 
 
 
expanded safety analysis, there were no deaths, no SAEs, no AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
and no safety signals emerged.  
In terms of laboratory findings, one subject had Grade 3/4 haematology or chemistry value that worsened 
compared with baseline during the Treatment Period. This subject had a single Grade 3 low neutrophil 
count on Day 1 (after dosing) that improved to Grade 2 on Day 15 and returned to within the reference 
range on Day 29. At PT Week 12 visit, the subject's neutrophil count decreased to Grade 2 again; no 
further follow-up is available. This Grade 3 low neutrophil count was not considered clinically significant 
by the investigator and was not reported as an AE. No other subjects had a Grade 3/4 haematology or 
chemistry value that worsened compared with baseline during the Treatment Period. 
Overall, Maviret was well tolerated in adolescents included in this study and the safety profile remains 
comparable to what has been observed in adults with fatigue being one of the most commonly reported 
ADRs. 
CHMP agreed that the provided data from the full adolescent cohort (n=47) further reinforce the positive 
benefit-risk balance that was estimated made on the basis of data from the 13 patients from the intensive 
PK cohort. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP agreed that this extension of indication application for Maviret is approvable from a safety 
perspective. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.1 is acceptable 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 4.1 with the following content: 
Safety concerns 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information was not changed.  
Pharmacovigilance plan 
Only the summary of Objectives has been updated for the study to evaluate the risk of de novo 
hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with compensated cirrhosis treated with direct-acting antivirals for 
chronic hepatitis C/Planned. 
The hepatic Questionnaire was also removed from the pharmacovigilance activities.

Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimization activities are still sufficient to manage the safety concerns of the product. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
The agreed PI changes are included in the attached approved Product Information.  
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Maviret. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable.  
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Maviret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as it includes two new active substances. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Hepatitis  C  viral  infection  is  a  global  health  problem,  with  184  million  individuals  chronically  infected 
worldwide. An estimated 13.2 million children between the ages of 1 and 15 years old are infected with 
HCV globally.  
Within  Europe's  paediatric  population,  prevalence  of  HCV  ranges  from  0.05%  to  0.36%.  New  HCV 
infections among the 5 – 14 year old age group constituted 0.4% of all new infections, while the age 
group of 15 – 19 year olds constituted 1.2% of all new infections in the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) 
during 2015. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Although  the  majority  of  children  have  a  mild  disease  and  do  not  need  urgent  treatment,  guidance 
published  by  the  Hepatology  Committee  of  the  European  Society  for  Paediatric  Gastroenterology, 
Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) in 2018 recommend that all children  with chronic  HCV infection 
should be considered for treatment, considering that the rational underlying the indications for treatment 
of adults with chronic infection is also valid for children.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current  approved  treatment  options  for  children  <  12  years  old  remains  limited,  as  IFN-free  DAA 
regimens  are  not  yet  approved  for  use  in  this  population.  For  adolescents,  ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
(LDV/SOF) and SOF + RBV have been recently approved for use, but they are not pan genotypic IFN-free 
and the recommended regimen for HCV GT2 and GT3 infection require co-administration with RBV.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application for an extension of the indication to adolescents is supported by new clinical data from 
part 1 of Study M16-123 [An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, 
and Efficacy of Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir in Pediatric Subjects with Genotypes 1 - 6 Chronic Hepatitis C 
Virus (HCV) Infection (DORA)] which evaluated the use of the adult co-formulated tablets in adolescents 
(12 to < 18 years of age). 
The application for an extension of the indication to adolescents was primarily supported by the interim 
analysis of study M16-123 including the PK, efficacy and safety data from the 13 adolescent from the 
intensive PK cohort. In response to the RSI, the MAH provided the data from the full adolescent cohort, 
which consists in the 13 patients included in the IPK analysis and 34 additional patients from the non-IPK 
analysis.  
The study population now consist in 47 adolescents of whom 4 (8.5%) were infected with HCV GT3, 11 
(23.4%) were treatment-experienced (all 11 received previous IFN-based regimen) and 2 (4.3%) were 
HIV/HCV co-infected. No patients had cirrhosis.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Maviret has been shown to be highly effective in adults. 
Exposure to GLE/PIB in adolescent 12-18 years receiving the adult dose has been estimated by intensive 
PK in 10 patients and has been shown to be comparable to adults. All 47 adolescents, including the 13 
from the intensive PK analysis and 34 additional adolescent included in the non-intensive PK analysis, 
achieved SVR12. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Sample  size  is  limited  to  47  adolescents,  including  some  adolescents  more  difficult  to  treat  as 
treatment-experienced (n=11), GT3 (n=4), (GT3 TE n=3). With the exception of 1 patient with baseline 
fibrosis stage F2 and 1 with fibrosis F3, all were non cirrhotic patients.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, no safety concerns emerged from the expanded safety analysis pertaining to 47 subjects. The 
most commonly reported drug-related AE is fatigue (n=3, 6.4%) which is already listed in the Maviret 
SmPC.  
One case of depression and suicidal ideation in a subject with a history of depression was reported during 
this study. On the basis of the information provided by the MAH, it seems that the event was most likely 
related to school bullying. Due to the signal towards depression and suicidal ideation with Viekirax, it is 
expected that the issue of psychiatric disorders, a fortiori in the vulnerable population of adolescents, is 
scrutinized in forthcoming PSURs. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of patients is limited. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The  availability  of  potent  and  convenient  DAA  for  the  paediatric  population  is  important.  The  clinical 
development issues of these medicines in this population and the willingness to accelerate the access of 
Assessment report  
EMA/154469/2019  
Page 32/34 
 
 
 
children to new DAA regimens have been highlighted numerous times, including in an expert meeting 
held at the EMA. In this context, Maviret, a FDC including two new generation pan genotypic DAA, with its 
8 weeks simplified regimen for easy to treat patients (expected to be the majority of adolescents) and no 
ribavirin requirement, represents a valuable therapeutic tool for the adolescent population.  
Following recommendation from this EMA expert meeting and other discussions with regulators, the MAH 
planned  a  paediatric  study  whose  primary  endpoint  is  systemic  exposure.  The  interim  analysis  of 
M16-123 study included PK, efficacy and safety data from the 13 adolescent included in the intensive PK 
portion of Part 1 study; i.e the adolescent IPK cohort. In the IPK cohort, all patients were to be TN, without 
cirrhosis,  without  coinfection  and  received  8  weeks  regimen.  PK  data  showed  similar  exposure  as  in 
adults,  enabling  to  predict  similar  efficacy  and  safety.  Additional  safety/efficacy  data  from  the  full 
adolescent cohort (n=47) reinforced the level of reassurance as regards the efficacy of Maviret at the 
adult dose in adolescents and on the safe use of the drug in this population. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
Based on the data presented in this application, the CHMP agreed that the overall benefit-risk of Maviret 
is positive. 
4.  Recommendations
